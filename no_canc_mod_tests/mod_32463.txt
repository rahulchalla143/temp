CT Abdomen, Pelvis: 1.
Non-contrast technique limits evaluation for pancreatic necrosis and vascular complications.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old female with type 2 diabetes, HTN, HL, admitted with shock of unclear etiology -- septic shock (leukocytosis, hypothermia), distributive shock secondary to pancreatitis (lipase >2500, radiographic evidence of pancreatitis), and toxic ingestion (?ethylene glycol -- elevated osmolar gap).
The differenital included septic shock (leukocytosis, hypothermia), distributive shock secondary to pancreatitis (lipase >2500, radiographic evidence of pancreatitis), and toxic ingestion (?ethylene glycol -- elevated osmolar gap).
CXR showed no infection initially, and the patient was anuric so we were unable to send urine.
Patient's osmolar gap was suggestive of a toxic ingestion such as ethylene glycol or methanol.
The patient presented with a Cr of 10.
Urgent CVVH was attempted, however the patients blood pressure would not tolerate dialysis.
Ethylene glycol and methanol levels were sent out and found to be negative.
A most mortem examination was declined by the family.
