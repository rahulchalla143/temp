A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed severe coronary artery disease with an left ventricular aneurysm.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal with normal free wall contractility.
The left ventricular aneurysm is no longer seen.
LV systolic function is slightly improved and is estimated at 30-35%.
Right ventricular systolic function continues to be normal.
