CXR [**2178-5-18**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right subclavian line has been removed.
CT Head [**2178-5-17**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute intracranial abnormality.
EEG [**2178-5-17**] (further EEG's pending) IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured a single pushbutton activation that did not show evidence of seizures.
Routine sampling showed a mildly encephalopathic background with faster frequencies suggestive of medication effect.

Given status epilepticus, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
She underwent EEG monitoring which initially corresponded to the sedation with burst suppression, then generalized slowing with bitemporal predominance, then slow normal EEG with temporal sharp waves - the latter in [**Location (un) **] with previously described abnormalities.
Lung Opacities Given Lung opacities were noted on arrival, improving somewhat with gentle diuresis.
Lung opacities were noted in the context of cocaine use and aspiration.
Given that you were in status epilepticus, you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
You underwent EEG monitoring which initially corresponded to the sedation that you had received, then demonstrated previously described abnormalities without seizures.
