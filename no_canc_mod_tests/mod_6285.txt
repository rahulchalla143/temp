Was seen in liver clinic two days prior to admission with increase in total bilirubin to 26.2 and was sent home.
In the emergency department temperature is 99.6, pulse 84, blood pressure 134/87, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 97% on room air.
Cultures were sent and therapeutic paracentesis was performed.
Total bilirubin was 25.5, creatinine 1.7.
Chest x-ray consistent with worsening pleural effusion, seemed acute and chronic.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) End stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C from blood transfusion.
Liver biopsy was positive for active hepatitis C, was treated with Interferon.
2) Recurrent biliary stricture [**2199-12-9**], endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement and [**2200-1-9**] stent occlusion with tent replacement, status post stent removal with ballooning, status post treatment with Ampicillin and Gentamicin for cholangitis, status post a Roux-en-Y.procedure [**2200-10-9**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital temperature - temperature 99.6, pulse 84, blood pressure 134/87, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 97% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: positive scleral icterus.
Extremities 2 to 3+ pitting edema to the knees, no spider angiomata, no pulmonary erythema.
LABORATORY DATA:  WBC 3.4, hematocrit 25.5, platelets 65, MCV 100, INR 2.3 with 87% neutrophils, 5% bands, 6% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes.
Sodium 147, potassium 4.6, chloride 116, bicarbonate 17, BUN 24, creatinine 1.9, glucose 103, ALT 33, AST 77, LDH 217, alkaline phosphatase 128, amylase 130, total bilirubin 26.4, albumin 2.8.
Urinalysis negative for blood, negative for nitrites, negative for protein, negative for glucose, 0 to 2 RBCs, no white blood cell count, rare bacteria and no squamous epithelium.
Cyclosporin level 85.
Ascites analysis 500 WBCs, 625 RBCs, 90% polys, 5+ lymphs, 5% basophils, amylase 9, albumin less than .1.
Peritoneal culture pending at that time.
In addition, she was continued on her Neoral and it was redosed given that the levels were subtherapeutic.
In addition, the CT head examination was performed to rule out other causes of encephalopathy and this was negative.
The patient's hematocrit dropped to 22.5 and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
Vital signs were stable but again was noted to have a low hematocrit of approximately 24 and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
At this time the patient's INR was 2.5 and remained elevated despite vitamin K.  Patient had a paracentesis, was doing marginally better until that day when the paracentesis was performed and noted to have frankly bloody ascites.
Cardiovascularly she was hemodynamically stable and the fresh frozen plasma was given to help intravenous volume repletion.
Pulmonarily her O2 saturations were stable and she was placed on biPAP for airway protection but did not require intubation during her Intensive Care Unit course.
In addition, the patient was continued on Meropenem, Vancomycin per the infectious disease service and cultures were drawn.
Patient's renal failure progressed to creatinine of 2.4 and this was felt secondary to decreased intravascular volume versus early hepatorenal syndrome.
Creatinine continued to rise worrisome for continued acute tubular necrosis.
However, the bilirubin continued to rise and was deemed stable.
Hepatology service, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**], discussed with [**Hospital1 1774**] service transfer for possible evaluation for repeat liver transplant.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1) Prevacid 30 mg per nasogastric tube q.d., 2) regular insulin sliding scale, 3) Reglan 10 mg intravenous t.i.d., 4) lactulose 30 cc p.r.
