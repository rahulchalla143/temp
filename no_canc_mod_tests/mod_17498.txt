A transthoracic echo done at that time showed a circumferential pericardial effusion with right diastolic collapse, consistent with tamponade.
Ejection fraction of 55 percent and a well seated aortic valve.
LABORATORY DATA:  On day of admission, white count 16.4 hematocrit 27.1, platelets 813, PT 22.5, INR 3.2.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.3, chloride 97, CO2 22, BUN 15, creatinine 0.8, glucose 156.
Pericardial fluid showed white cells of 14,300, hematocrit of 25.5, total protein 6.9, glucose 88.
LDH 815, amylase 20 and albumin 3.7.
Chest x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly, resolution of small pericardial effusion and persistent atelectasis of the left lung.
Repeat echo done after cardiac catheterization laboratory drainage of the pericardial effusion showed symmetric LVH with an ejection fraction of 55 percent.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, heart rate 81 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 142/63, respiratory rate 26, O2 saturation 94 percent on 2 liters.
Respiratory clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Two plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
She had a repeat echocardiogram which showed continued resolution of the pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade, following which she was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to 524 for continuing post drain care and observation.
The pericardial drain was removed and an echocardiogram done on hospital day three also showed good cardiac function with no reaccumulation of the pericardial effusion.
On hospital day four, it was noted that the patient's INR had drifted down to 1.3.
Additional echocardiogram showed that there was no reaccumulation of her pericardial effusion.
At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical exam is as follows.
Temperature 97.6, heart rate 73 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 96 percent on room air.
Weight on day of discharge 93.5.
LABORATORY DATA:  PT 16.7, PTT 61.2, INR 1.8, sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 100, CO2 26, BUN 15, creatinine 0.7, glucose 104.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Follow- up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55573**]  on the [**11-16**] for INR check.
Warfarin, the patient is to take as directed to maintain a    goal INR of 2.5 to 3.
