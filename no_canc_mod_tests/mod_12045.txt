Admission Date:  [**2114-10-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2114-10-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2065-7-29**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year-old woman with idiopathic cardiomyopathy diagnosed one to two months ago with an EF ranging from 25 to 40% on various echocardiograms, Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 18 treated with chemotherapy as well as radiation therapy to the mediastinum, history of left bundle branch block, hypertension, coronary artery disease, who presents from the outside hospital with presenting symptoms being nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion and weakness for two days.
There she ruled in for a nonST elevation myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 427 and an MB of 21 and a troponin of 5.82.
She developed a junctional rhythm with a rate of 44 and a blood pressure of 90/48 at that time.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization and possible PCI.
Known coronary artery disease with workup to date as follows, cardiac catheterization on [**6-13**] showed a codominant system with a 50 to 60% lesion at the left circumflex and 80 to 90% right coronary artery osteal narrowing, normal left ventricular EF, moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation, wedge of 22 and pulmonary artery pressure 40/22.
Cardiac output not measured at that time.
Echocardiogram of [**6-18**] showed an EF of 40%, left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular dimensions, 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
ETT on [**9-10**] exercise nine minutes on [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, stopped for chest tightness and progressive dyspnea on exertion.
Electrocardiogram not interpretable.
Echocardiogram on [**9-6**] left atrial dilation, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with EF of 25%, 4+ mitral regurgitation and no pericardial effusion.
Cardiac catheterization on [**8-18**], right coronary artery osteal lesion 80%, EF 41% and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
An exercise MIBI in [**8-18**] showed a mild septal wall defect.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.0, hematocrit 28.9, hemoglobin 10.3, platelets 371.
Chem 7 sodium 131, potassium 4.1, chloride 97, bicarb 23, BUN 40, creatinine 1.9, glucose 120, calcium 8.4, magnesium 2.1, phosphate 5.1.
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**] her CK was 167 with an MB of 6.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 78 with a left bundle branch block, which is old.
Chest x-ray within normal limits.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 69**] she went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where a left heart catheterization revealed 99% right coronary artery osteal stenosis with TIMI one flow.
B:  Ventricular function:  Hemodynamics measured a cardiac catheterization revealed significantly elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 15, mean PAP of 22, mean wedge of 15 and LVEDP of 16.
Left ventriculogram showed anterolateral wall hypokinesis and the LVEF was calculated at 50%.
Given the patient's systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction Lasix and ace inhibitor was continued.
Her left bundle branch block persisted throughout her hospital stay and her rate was within normal limits.
Recheck of the hematocrit revealed that the hematocrit was stable and no bleeding was suspected.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Electrolyte repletion was provided to maintain the patient's potassium above 4 and the her magnesium above 2.
