In the ED, initial vs were: T98.4, P77, BP130/61, R30, O2 sat 92% on RA or 2L.
SBP up to 175 but initially in ?90s systolic.
Per notes and report, O2 sat decreased with lying down (not clear how low in notes; by report was low 90s on NRB).
Weaned to 4 L NC with sats in high 90s, but continued to have RRs in 20s.
CXR with atelectasis; CTA without dissection or PE, also showed atelectasis.
RUQ US and CT abdomen without explaining pathology; fatty liver and cholelithiasis only.
Ruled out for MI with troponins negative x 3.

IMAGING/STUDIES: RUQ U/S ([**9-8**]): 1.
MRCP ([**2144-9-6**]): 1.
ECHO ([**2144-9-7**]): Suboptimal image quality.
CXR ([**9-5**]): Lung volumes remain low.
CTA chest/CT abdomen: extensive atherosclerosis, no aortic dissection, no PE identified.
ACS, PE, dissection ruled out with cardiac enzymes and chest CTA.
# Elevated LFTs: Pt presented with ALT of 920, AST of 1185, Alk Phos of 163, and Tbili of 3.3.
RUQ U/S showed fatty liver and cholelithiasis, with no evidence of a portal vein thrombosis.
Pt's serum was negative for Tylenol and pt denies use.
All hepatitis and herpes serologies were negative and [**Doctor First Name **] and [**Last Name (un) 15412**] were negative as well.
Her elevations were likely [**1-20**] AZO use vs a stone in the CBD that subsequently passed.
We gave her IVF and bowel rest and trended her LFTs, which continued to decline during her admission.
The pt improved clinically over the course of admission and subsequent blood cultures did not show any growth.
# Hypoxia and tachypnea: Pt had O2 sats in the high 90s on 1L and low to mid 90s on RA.
She received an echo, which showed an EF of 50-55%.
# Hyperglycemia: Pt presented with glucose levels in the 200s.
Her lipid profile shows LDL of 210 and total cholesterol of 287.
We found that your liver enzymes were elevated, which is likely due to over the counter medication that you were taking.
You received two liver ultrasounds and an MRI of your liver that showed that you have stones in your gall bladder, but no evidence of gall bladder infection or stones obstructing your bile ducts.
We found bacterial growth in your blood cultures for which you were put on antibiotics.
