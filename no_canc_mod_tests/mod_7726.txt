Prominent sulci and ventricles, likely age-related involutionary changes  XR CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2206-2-11**] 1:24 PM FINDINGS: A large-bore dual-lumen dialysis catheter from a right internal jugular approach is in stable and standard course and position.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
IMPRESSION: Relatively stable chest x-ray examination with no acute pulmonary process noted.
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL Study Date of [**2206-2-12**] 8:33 AM FINDINGS: There is limited visualization of the liver, especially of the left hepatic lobe given the extensive bowel gas.
The abdominal aorta demonstrates moderate atherosclerotic calcification, without aneurysmal dilation.
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2206-2-12**] 11:19 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2206-2-12**] 7:51 PM IMPRESSION: Limited examination due to motion artifacts.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2206-2-13**] at 3:34:27 PM Focused imaging performed.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2206-1-30**], no obvious change but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive comparison.
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2206-2-14**] at 5:46:17 PM No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
Maneuvers were not performed due to iniability of patient to cooperate.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
MRA NECK W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2206-2-14**] 8:44 PM IMPRESSION: Limited study due to motion.

No interval change in the left occipital lobe hyperdensity since the earlier study of [**2206-2-11**], which represents a combination of calcification and blood products.

Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL SUMMARY: 62 yo male with history of HBV/HCV/EtOH cirrhosis with hepatic failure s/p liver [**Date Range **] on immunosuppression, ESRD on HD, seizure disorder, polymyositis on prednisone, recent STEMI ([**2205-12-5**]) on ASA/clopidogrel, recent large GI bleed [**1-8**] duodenal ulcer s/p clipping and injection, and recent admission for sepsis (d/c [**2206-1-30**]) admitted from rehab facility with altered mental status and elevated WBC count.
He had an EEG on his prior admission [**2205-1-28**] which showed non-specific slowing but no epileptiform activity or focal slowing.
Further work up was undertaken and included LP (initially unobtainable at bedside; patient was ultimately intubated for this and other procedures and LP was performed by IR; CSF was notable only for elevated protein to 178; cultures were negative), MRI (which revealed multiple embolic infarcts as per report above); EEG (consistent with encephalopathy, no seizure activity documented); and CT scan to evaluate area of hyperdensity in occipital lobe concerning for progression of old bleed.
Tacrolimus toxicity/PRES was considered as a possible etiology of symptoms, but MRI was not consistent with that diagnosis (instead revealed embolic strokes).
Embolic stroke work up included echo with bubble study (negative) and MRI/MRA of neck demonstrating calcified plaque with narrowing of the distal left common carotid artery.
He was initially placed on heparin gtt where he was frequently supratherapeutic given his ESRD; this was stopped in the setting of Hct to 27 (from 40 on admission) and concern for expansion of old/subacute bleed in occipital region on imaging.
Subsequent echocardiogram showed preserved EF with no major new wall motion abnormalities.
# HYPOTENSION: On [**2206-2-15**], patient became acutely hypotensive to SBP in 70s.
Lactate was elevated to 8 and central venous O2 sat was as low as 32%.
A CVL and an A-line were placed for monitoring; due to extreme difficulty with line placement, the A-line was placed by the general surgery team.
The cardiology fellow was consulted by telephone, but given the normal echocardiogram, absence of EKG changes, and CVP of 6 he felt the overall clinical picture was inconsistent with cardiogenic shock.
The patient's blood pressures stabilized within 24 hours and he was taken off of pressors.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient was noted to have elevated WBC count to 18K on admission which peaked at 21K following seizure.
Cultures of blood, sputum, and CSF were unrevealing and C. difficile was negative.
HCV viral load was positive, though HBV and CMV viral loads were negative.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient was intubated on [**2206-2-13**] because he was unable to tolerate critical studies including MRI and LP without requiring sedation.
Ultrasound of the arm was notable for brachial/axillary non-occlusive DVT.
However, LFTs were noted to be elevated on this admission to peak values on the day of admission of ALT 258, AST 474, LDH 1519.
TB peaked several days later at 0.8 and INR at 1.4.
HCV viral load returned positive at 3,500,000 copies; HBV and CMV viral loads were negative.
Unfortunately, the monitor did not save the rhythm strip and it could not be printed for evaluation.
He was monitored on telemetry during his ICU stay with no further events.
# HYPERTENSION: Patient was periodically hypertensive during his ICU stay to SBP > 200s.
Pressures were controlled to goal of SBP 160 in accordance with neurology recommendations.
FS was 130 after seizure on [**2206-2-12**].
All medications except those geared towards comfort - morphine, zyprexa, tylenol, prochlorperazine - were discontinued.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 31427**] House (Hospice Home) - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Stroke, seizure disorder, Coronary Artery Disease, End Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis, Hepatitis B / Hepatitis C / EtOH Cirrhosis status-post Liver [**Hospital1 1326**], Polymyositis     Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
