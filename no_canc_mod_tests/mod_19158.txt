Admission Date:  [**2179-2-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-2-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-1-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization ([**2179-2-18**])  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 78 y/o active M who has been feeling bad for the last 10 days.
Patient then was seen by his cardiologist who performed an echo at [**Location (un) **] and found to have reduced LVEF of 15%.
Patient returned to [**Location **] where he recieved aspirin, plavix, and started on Nitro gtt and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath where he was found to have 3 vessel disease with 60% proximal LAD, 80% mid LAD, 70% mid LCx, and 90% RCA lesions.
States he had several episodes of PND and chest tightness a few days prior.
Past Medical History: s/p appy prostate procedure  Social History: Retired plumber Plays hockey 3x week Currently non-etoh; however previous history of heavy drinking quit 25 years ago No drugs No tobacco   Family History: Father had MI (died) age 67 Mother died of TB All children healthy  Physical Exam: T 98.4 Hr 85 114/75 RR 16 O2Sat 98% 3L Gen: NAD, lying flat Heent: PERRL, EOMI, scelra anicteric, MMM Neck: no carotid bruits; Chest: Crackles at R base, clear ant/lat Cardiac: RRR S1/S2 +S3 no murmurs Abdomen: soft, Ext: no edema, DP +2 Neuro: AAOx3   Pertinent Results: Cardiac catheterization ([**2179-2-18**]):  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated a three vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 19 mm Hg and a mean PCWP of 33 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography was deferred given elevated filling pressures.
TTE ([**2179-2-19**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
EKG ([**2179-2-18**]): NSR @ 84, low voltage in limb leads, normal intervals, Flat T V4-V5 .
Persantine myocardial perfusion study ([**2179-2-22**]): 1) Severe, globally decreased left ventricular wall motion with an LVEF of 19%.
4)There is no significant change in reduced uptake in the inferior wall on delayed 24 hour images which suggests non-viability.

His TSH and ferritin were normal and helped rule out metabolic causes of his cardiomyopathy.
He was called out to the floor where he underwent evaluation for CABG by the CT surgery team.
Carotid dopplers showed an insignificant amount of atherosclerosis.
A persantine myocardial viability study confirmed his markedly depressed LVEF (19%) and delyaed images showed no evidence of uptake throughout his fixed inferior wall defect, which is suggestive of nonviability.
