If there is concern for acute cord injury, MRI would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
[**5-13**] CT sinus: 1.
[**5-13**] CT Torso: 1.
A bone scan can be obtained for further evaluation.
[**5-13**] CTA Head: Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, more significant at the basal cisterns as described above.
[**5-14**] CT head: 1.
[**2130-5-17**] CT head No evidence for new hemorrhage.
[**2130-5-23**]: Chest X-ray: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient sitting semi-erect position.
In comparison with the next previous study of [**5-18**] no significant progressive abnormality has been identified.
[**2130-5-24**]: CT head: 1.
CT temporal bones [**2130-5-24**]: 1.
They recommended CT temporal bones and a nuclear medicine study.
The cisternogram was done at 4hrs and 24hrs.
He had a speech and swallow exam on [**5-22**] and a pureed diet was initiated.
Head CT's showed continued evolution of contusions as expected.
CT head on [**5-24**] showed no SDH formation from CSF drainage.
Blood cultures were negative.
UA and culture were positive and Levaquin was started.
CXR showed vascular congestion.
CSF was sent on [**2130-5-19**] and [**5-21**].
Final cultures showed no growth.
**CT imaging at presentation revealed bone islands and sclerotic changes of the axial skeleton.
A bone scan may be needed in the future after he recovers from his trauma.
