Following thorough examination and CT imaging of her head, cervical spine, and torso, she was found to only have a right frontal scalp contusion with small overlying laceration.
She was started on a CIWA scale and her hematocrit was followed serially, which remained stable.
A tertiary survey was completed, and no new injuries were identified.
A nasal bone fracture was also seen on imaging but appeared to be an old fracture.
