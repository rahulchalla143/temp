CTA abdomen: There is new bibasilar atelectasis, without evidence of effusion.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is some free fluid in the pelvis.
TTE [**2188-6-10**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CT TORSO ON [**2188-6-9**] FINDINGS: Right IJ central line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
Within the pelvis there is increasing amount of free fluid as compared to study of [**6-3**].

Her creatinine started at 0.6 and peaked at 7.2.
# Enterococcus UTI: Noted from urine culture on admission.
Given PCN allergy, pt was treated with 3 day course of IV vancomycin with subsequent urine cultures with no growth.
Following extubation, the psychiatry team visited patient and recommmended continuing to hold escitalopram & buspirone, though they felt in near future she would likely need to restart some anti-depressant.
