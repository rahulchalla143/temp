EMS was called and, on their arrival, noted her HR was in 20-30s & SBP was in 60s.

[**12-27**] Urine cx: >100K E coli, pan-sensitive [**1-7**] Urine cx: no growth .
CT Head w/o contrast:  No bleed.
TTE [**12-28**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
[**1-7**] CT abdomen/pelvis: Small right-sided retroperitoneal and intramuscular hematoma, with diffuse soft tissue anasarca and bilateral pleural effusions.
Her urine culture revealed a pan-sensitive E coli and thus azithromycin was discontinued.
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, felt secondary to her CHF.
She was diuresed with lasix as her blood pressure tolerated.
She received glucagon 5mg x3 & calcium without significant response.
To assess cardiac function, a TTE was obtained demonstrating EF 45-50%, mild regional L ventricular dysfunction, probable diastolic dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary HTN.
EKG also demonstrated old RBBB, old LAFB, and ST depressions in inferior and lateral precordial leads.
She was placed on a dopamine drip transiently with good response and her bradycardia resolved soon afterwards.
Her creatinine was elevated to 2.3 on admission, felt likely to represent pre-renal renal failure.
Her creatinine returned to baseline by [**1-7**].
?Myocardial ischemia: There was concern initially for ACS/ischemia in the setting of hypotension and EKG revealing ST depressions.
However, she had not complained of CP (per family) & 2 sets of cardiac enzymes were negative.
Repeat CXR showed no change in her bilateral pleural effusions, likely secondary to CHF.
Diuresis was continued on the floor, first with PO lasix and then IV lasix as her blood pressure tolerated.
No evidence of seizures, CT negative for ICH.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**2-6**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed.
Hematocrit stable.
