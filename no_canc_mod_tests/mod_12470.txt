The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for further care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On presentation the patient's temperature was 97.2, pulse of 84, blood pressure of 103/41, respiratory rate of 20, and 100%; the patient was intubated.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her rectal examination was guaiac-positive.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On presentation, her white blood cell count was 14.6, her hematocrit was 32.8, and her platelets were 125.
Her sodium was 136, potassium of 4.8, chloride of 113, bicarbonate of 12, blood urea nitrogen of 99, creatinine of 3, blood glucose of 77.
She was noted to have 10 bands on admission.
Her urinalysis was noted to have moderate blood, 3 to 5 red blood cells on microbiology.
Her blood gas was 7.19/32/72/13 and a base deficit of 14.
Her PT was 15.
Her PTT was 38.1.
Her INR was 1.6.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   She had a chest x-ray which was within normal limits.
A CT of her abdomen was noted to have free fluid in her pelvis.
A PA catheter as well as an arterial line were placed, and the patient was placed on high-dose penicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin.
A central venous catheter was placed, and the patient was quickly transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.
A PA catheter was then placed, and the patient was placed on intravenous antibiotics which included high-dose penicillin, clindamycin, and meropenem.
The patient also had to be placed on a dopamine drip and Levophed to maintain her blood pressure.
On [**7-5**], the patient's condition continued to deteriorate requiring the addition of epinephrine to maintain vascular and her blood pressure.
Also noted was that the patient's cardiac enzymes, and her MB fractions, as well as her troponin were noted to be significantly elevated.
At that time, an echocardiogram was obtained as well as an electrocardiogram which all showed that the patient had recently suffered an acute myocardial infarction.
Her urine output also improved slightly.
However, after leaving the feeding tube in her stomach the patient spontaneously passed the feeding tube post pylorically and was able to tolerate some of the tube feeds that were given to her at a rate of 40 cc an hour.
Nevertheless, however, her platelet count continued to drop so that by [**7-6**], the patient's platelet count had dropped to 28.
Although, the patient's heart rate spontaneously returned to her baseline, her blood pressure remained low requiring increasing her dopamine drip from an initial renal dose to up to 10, even as high as 15.
Her blood pressure became more labile, dropping spontaneously to the 80s and requiring increases in her pressors.
Despite that, the patient's blood pressure still spontaneously dropped to the 80s.
Her conjunctivae, at that point, were noted to be completely red showing evidence of bleed.
The fresh frozen plasma was given since the patient suddenly had become coagulopathic and her PT went up to as high as 26 with an INR going up a high as 5.
Subsequently, on [**7-14**], at 2:30 p.m., the patient's family decided at that point to withdraw care and her vasopressors were then discontinued, and the patient expired quickly thereafter.
