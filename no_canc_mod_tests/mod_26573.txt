TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the cervical spine were obtained with coronal and sagittal reconstructions.
CT C-SPINE: There are fractures extending through the transverse foramen of C2 bilaterally.
There is limited evaluation of intrathecal contents; however, the contour of the thecal sac is within normal limits.
Given the location of the fractures, there is concern for associated vertebral artery injury, and further evaluation with a CTA is recommended.
your toes may touch the ground but no weight should be placed on it; you should use crutches to keep the weight off that leg.
