[**2148-5-3**] ECHO Conclusions: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2147-6-27**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
[**2148-5-4**] Abdominal Ultrasound 1.
Likely areas of focal fatty sparing, however a short term follow-up study (approx 3 months) is recommended to exclude space occupying lesions.
If there is clincal concern, further work-up with MRI may be performed.
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2148-5-2**] for a cardiac catheterization  and surgical management of his mitral valve disease.
The cardiac catheterization was significant for severe left main disease, a 95% stenosed left anterior descending artery, a moderately disease circumflex artery and severe mitral valve regurgitation.
an Echocardiogram was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of 25%, an apical left ventricular aneurysm, 3+ mitral regurgitation and a moderately dilated left ventricular cavity.
Cultures of his sternal wound were negative and the vancomycin was discontinued.
