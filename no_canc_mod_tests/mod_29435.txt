She was found to have ST elevations on her EKG, which were consistent with previous findings, a positive D-dimer, and an initial Troponin of 0.8.
A CT angio showed bilateral pulmonary emboli.

In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], a bedside echo was performed and did not show significant heart strain.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
On HD 3 she was bridged to lovenox, bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds showed no evidence of clots, and she was prepared for discharge.
Important outpatient issues discussed with the primary MD: outpatient stress test recommended by cardiology, outpatient hypercoaguability workup (protein c and S and free protein S), follow up with Thoracic surgery at scheduled appointment for workup of right upper lobe 6mm spiculated nodule.
Followup Instructions: You have an appointment scheduled with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], a thoracic surgeon, on [**10-25**] at 10 AM to discuss the right lung nodule that was seen on CT scan.
An outpatient stress test should be scheduled and a future hypercoaguability workup should be completed.
