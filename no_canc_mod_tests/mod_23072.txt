Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-8-4**], the LV walls are better seen.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cannot be excluded.
The sum of son[**Name (NI) 493**] and CT findings are concerning for acute cholecystitis.
Pancreas not visualized  [**2189-8-3**] Abd CT :IMPRESSIONS: 1.
Together with same-day son[**Name (NI) 493**] findings, CT findings are concerning for acute cholecystitis.
Pancreatic cyst and vague hypodense area are likely incidental findings.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
[**8-5**] /09 Abdominal CT: IMPRESSION:  1.
Gallstone pancreatitis and Choledocholithiasis: Patient initially transferred from OSH with symptoms of biliary obstruction (elevated LFTs and total bilirubin of 9.4) and pancreatitis.
WBC count decreased from 21.4 on admission to 12.9 following ERCP.
Postoperative course with numberous complications including acute on chronic renal failure, acute anemia, acute respiratory distress and rising WBC count (all outlined below).
LFTs had trended down, total bilirubin was 1.4 and patient was tolerating oral intake.
Of note, on his initial abdominal CT a pancreatic cyst/mass was noted at the junction of the head and the body thus prompting a repeat abdominal CT with pancreatic protocol.
His repeat CT scan noted that the cyst was an incidenental finding and should be followed in 6 months with a repeat scan or MRI.
Labile HTN: Throughout hospital course, patient had labile HTN with systolic BP rising to as high as 180s- 200s, prompting multiple changes in BP management.
Initially, patient was continued on his home verapamil SR 240mg daily although his ACEI was held secondary to creatinine of 2.1 (see below).
Blood pressure was initially controlled with hydralazine.
Labetolol was also added to blood pressure regimen, and pressures became more well controlled and stable, with SBP ranging mostly in 120's - 130's.
ABG on transfer was 7.44/23/102, with a HCO3 of 16.
CXR showed increased interstitial pattern consistent with early pulmonary edema.
While patient has an extensive smoking history, he has no known history of COPD and labs were not consistent with chronic CO2 retention.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled, with troponins .02, .04 and negative CK-MB.
Overall respiratory status improved, with fluid balance of -2.5 liters during 2 days of MICU stay.
His CXR also showed increased fluid, and he was given IV lasix.
Leukocytosis: Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient had WBC of 24.5 with a neutrophil predominance of 92% secondary to cholecystitis and  gallstone pancreatitis.
Following initial ERCP, WBC fell to 12.9.
After laproscopic cholecystectomy on [**8-9**], WBC count again rose to the 20s although patient remained afebrile and without focal symptoms of infection.
Abdominal exam was unremarkable, giving low suspicion for a surgical deep space infection.
Urine culture from [**8-11**] was negative.
The positive urine culture on [**8-14**] was attributed to bladder trauma from the previous evening (see dementia/agitation).
He remained afebrile with WBC 9.6 at discharge.
At baseline, patient exhibited marked cognitive impairment as indicated by mini-mental exam and his AMS may have represented features of his dementia.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled several times during postoperative course, and always remained negative, indicating no acute coronary syndrome.
Echo was performed on [**8-13**], showing function LVOT with a small gradient, slightly increased mitral regurgitation, and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressures.
Creatinine did increase to 2.4 on [**8-7**] likely from CT scan with acute dye load, but returned quickly to baseline with hydration.
Chemistries were checked daily to monitor renal function, and he maintained good urine output.
Will plan to restart if creatinine remains stable, or resume as outpatient.
Prior to his follow up visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] he will have an abdominal CT to evaluate the pancreas.
