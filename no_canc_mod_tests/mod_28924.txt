CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION .
Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation demonstrated three vessel disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal filling pressures with mean RA pressure of 3 mmHg and mPCWP of 8 mmHg.
Fick calculated cardiac output (using oxygen consumption index of 110 ml/M2) was preserved at 4.8 L/min and cardiac index was 3.3 L/min/M2.
The pulmonary artery  systolic pressure could not be determined.
TRACING #1 Read by: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] S.   Brief Hospital Course: # IMI - Patient had elevated ST segments in II, III, and aVF which correlated with the RCA stenosis seen on cath.
Patient's cardiac enzymes peaked on [**6-2**] and continued to trend down.
Her Lipid panel was as follows: LDL 16, HDL 12, TG 144 and thought to be due to lab error, will recommend follow up as outpatient.
# Pump - Previous EF unknown, post cath ECHO showed EF 45%.
Hct stabilized and was felt to be due to blood loss during placement of lines.
Pt was HIT negative and platelets stabilized prior to discharge.
