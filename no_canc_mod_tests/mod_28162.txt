Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated right and left heart filling pressures (RA mean 17mmHg, PCW mean 19mmHg).
The cardiac output and index were low at 3.8L/min and 1.98L/min/m2.
The SVR was elevated at 2147 dynes/sec/cm-5 and PVR severely elevatd at 611 dynes/sec/cm-5.
Lesion not well suited for PCI so surgical evaluation recommended.
TTE [**2139-3-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-6-10**], LV systolic function has substantially deteriorated, primarily due to inferior wall akinesis.
FDG Cardiac viability study: 1.
A more recent perfusion study may be helpful to evaluate global myocardial perfusion.
LUL 15 mm nodule, could represent focal atelectasis.
Cardiac cath [**3-13**]: 1.
Cardiac cath [**3-13**]: 1.
CT abd [**3-13**]: 1.
Expansion of the right pelvic retroperitoneal space with displacement of the urinary bladder.
CXR [**3-14**]: This is a slightly rotated film.
CT head [**3-15**]: No acute intracranial pathologic process.
CXR [**3-16**]: Improved aeration of the left lung.
CXR [**3-18**]: In comparison with the study of [**3-16**], there has been placement of a Dobhoff tube that curls within the upper stomach.
# NSTEMI with stenting, complicated by retroperitoneal bleed: pt presented with typical chest pain, cardiac enzymes peaked (trop 0.94).
She underwent cardiac cath which showed 3-vessel disease.
She underwent a FDG PET cardiac viability study which showed viable myocardium in the anterolateral wall and anterior portion of the apex, and decreased FDG activity in the rest of the myocardium.
Pt underwent repeat catheterization with PCI of distal RCA and proximal LAD, and POBA/export thrombectomy of RCA.
An export thrombectomy was performed on her RCA.
After the procedure the patient complained of back pain, was found to have a 5 point hematocrit drop and evidence of a large right-sided retroperitoneal bleed on CT. She was immediately taken back to the cath lab, and the bleeding artery (right inferior epigastric) was succesfully embolized with coils.
Serial hematocrits were monitored and remained stable.
Her vital signs remained stable and within normal limits.
Infectious work-up was unrevealing with negative urine and blood cultures, and CXR without pneumonia.
CT head was negative.
Pt underwent speech/swallow evaluation which found dysphagia (likely due to inattention rather than mechanical causes).
Neurology was consulted and believes that encephalopathy is likely hospital-related delirium vs post-cath microemboli vs medication-related (oxycodone and gabapentin were held after pt developed altered mental status).
Her renal function was 1.1 at time of discharge.
INACTIVE ISSUES: ---------------- # Hypertension - BP elevated to 180s/80s on admission, she was started on nitro gtt with improvement to SBP 130s/80s.
We initially gave her oxycodone with good control of pain, but discontinued this after she developed delirium, as above.
TRANSITION OF CARE: ------------------- # Pulmonary nodule - PDG viability study showed LUL 15 mm nodule, which could represent focal atelectasis.
She should have a repeat swallow evaluation in [**3-5**] days and once aspiration is not noted, NG tube can be removed.
# Pain control - as above, has spinal stenosis pain.
We started you on medications for your heart attack and did a cardiac catheterization, which showed 3-vessel disease of your coronary arteries (the vessels feeding your heart).
We did an MRI of your heart and decided to put stents into some of your vessels to help the blood flow to your heart.
You were having difficulty swallowing and an evaluation of your swallowing showed that you were aspirating food and drink into your lungs.
We have made the following changes to your medications: - START aspirin 325mg daily - START plavix 75mg daily (it is very important to take this medication daily without missing any doses, it helps keep your stents open) - START atorvastatin 80mg daily - START lisinopril 10mg daily and toprol XL 50mg daily for blood pressure and heart failure - TAKE lasix 20mg daily for your heart failure  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
