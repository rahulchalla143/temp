The patient was recently hospitalized at the [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2167-1-1**] through [**2167-1-2**] for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy and workup of a lung mass.
His weight was 134 pounds.
He was found to have a sodium of 106 and was admitted for further workup.
Liver mass on CT noticed in [**2166-11-24**] with new masses on MRI.
History of colonic polyps with last colonoscopy in [**2166-11-24**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.8, blood pressure 95/68, heart rate 78, respiratory rate 16, saturations 98% on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The examination is otherwise nonfocal.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, white count 11.6, hematocrit 43.5, platelets 157,000.
Sodium 106, potassium 5.4, chloride 81, bicarbonate 16, BUN 22, creatinine 0.9, glucose 127.
INR 1.6, ALT 76, AST 73, alkaline phosphatase 341, total bilirubin 5.4, total protein 6.3.
Amylase 64, lipase 41.
Chest x-ray showed question of a retrocardiac density, spiculated nodular opacification in the left upper lobe and a flattened diaphragms consistent with COPD.
Initially, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring with severe hypernatremia.
He presented with a bilirubin of 5.4, elevated ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase.
Ultrasound did have evidence of perihepatic ascites and in light of the patient's lethargy and confusion, plans were made for a diagnostic paracentesis.
This was done on [**2167-2-10**] without complications and laboratories returned later that evening with a white count in the fluid of greater than 20,000, red blood cells 4,800, with 78% polys.
He had an SAAG of 1.8 and this was consistent with portal hypertension with superimposed infection.
The patient was groaning to pain and touch to palpation of his abdomen but otherwise poorly responsive at that time.
We were unable to get IV access in the patient and a right internal jugular central line was placed and laboratories were sent.
Further workup was started.
The MICU Team was eventually called to evaluate the patient and the patient had a blood gas during this time also which showed a pH of 7.34, PC02 14, P02 73, lactate 5.3.
He had a repeat gas done on the floor as the patient's oxygen requirement increased.
Prior to that, a gas on 10 liters face mask showed a pH of 7.23, PC02 17, P02 89 with a lactate of 6.0.
Plans were made to consider a stat abdominal CT. Plans were to stabilize the patient prior to transferring to the CT scanner.
His blood pressure remained in the 80s to 60s range and he started to receive boluses of albumin in attempts to help his fluid remain intravascularly.
Repeat laboratories returned with INR from 1.6 to 2.9, albumin 2.2, total bilirubin of 2.7, AST/ALT of 40 and 64, white count of 11.8.
However, with increasing lactate, hypotension, and white count concern for sepsis.
Surgery evaluation was also called at the time to rule out perforation.
His blood gases were serially followed.
Eventually, he went down for a CT of his abdomen with gastrografin which revealed dilated loops of colon and small bowel with colonic wall thickening and no evidence of microperforation.
The Liver Team continued to follow him throughout his stay for his liver disease.
His abdomen had decreased with diuresis, however, with a bump in creatinine the diuretics were held and the patient's abdominal girth remained stable, however, with a drop in blood pressures.
His pressures remained in the 80s/60s range and at that blood pressure the patient continued to talk and mentate and continued to have reasonable urine output.
Overall, his blood pressure low at baseline, per family, run 90s/60s and were slightly lower as he was dehydrated and would drop at night as he would lose some vagal tone and receive some boluses.
His white count remained stable and his fever curve remained afebrile throughout his course on the floor.
However, his vancomycin trough was elevated and plans were to hold vancomycin until trough drops below 15.
He remained stable, oxygenating with his nasal cannula; however, at the time of this dictation did have a chest x-ray showing bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and possible bilateral pleural effusions which is consistent with his cirrhotic hyperalbuminemic state.
ANEMIA/THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  The patient did have a negative workup for hemolysis but possibly a low-grade DIC with rising INR and PTT and dropping fibrinogen in light of initial sepsis; however, this has been stabilized and his thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to his chronic liver disease and anemia likely secondary to malnutrition.
Continue supportive care with goal platelets at least greater than 20,000 and hematocrit greater than 30.
His rising chloride and low bicarbonate were also consistent with dehydration and contractions and continued to try to replete free water as above.
