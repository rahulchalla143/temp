ECG [**2185-8-30**]: Sinus tachycardia and frequent atrial ectopy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-8-26**] frequent atrial ectopy has appeared.
CXR [**2185-9-1**]: AP single view is obtained with patient in upright sitting position.
Otherwise, chest findings are unchanged and no pneumothorax has developed.
CXR [**2185-9-2**]: Relatively stable radiograph with large right upper lobe cavitary lesion persisting and subtle improved aeration of surrounding consolidation.
CT Head [**2185-9-3**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR [**2185-9-5**]: Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-8-30**] no diagnostic interval change.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-9-7**] no diagnostic interim change.
CXR [**2185-9-19**]: Slight worsening of multilobar pneumonia with associated underlying bullous disease and apparent cavitation.
Per old imaging ([**5-/2185**]) pt had a small apical bullae, but no cavitary lesions until his CT [**2185-8-14**].
Serial sputum cultures initially demonstrated pseudomonas sensitive to zosyn.
However, sputum cultures on [**2185-8-25**] demonstrated pseudomonas resistant to zosyn.
On [**2185-9-4**] sputum cultures demonstrated three isolates of pseudomonas, one sensitive to meropenem, though two of which were resistant to meropenem, but sensitive to tobramycin.
Pulmonology was consulted; bronchoscopy performed [**9-20**], which showed frank blood from the right upper lobe.
A Passy-Muir valve was placed and the patient was able to communicate.
However, many C. diff toxin studies were negative, and eventually, the diarrhea was treated with loperamide with good results.
He was eventually transferred back to a sliding scale and lantus, and his blood glucose levels were tolerable (120-180) on that regimen.
Iron studies showed increased ferritin, decreased TIBC, low iron, c/w anemia of chronic disease.
During the episodes of bleeding from the right upper lobe, the hematocrit dropped and the patient was transfused, but since then his hematocrit has been stable.
The patient's blood pressure was well-controlled on a standing dose of metoprolol.
