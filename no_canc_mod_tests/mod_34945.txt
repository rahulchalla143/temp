Given low SVR, normal PA diastolic, borderline leukocytosis and two possible infectious sources including BL gangrene and a mass on the RA lead of his AICD, hypotension was felt to be due to sepsis.
Although he initially had a low cardiac index, this was thought to be consistent with CHF with EF of 20%, and unlikley to be due to cardiogenic shock.
Pancultures were sent and antibiotic coverage was advanced to vancomycin and zosyn.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out ischemic source of troponic leak.
However cardiac enzymes remained flat.
# Pump: EF 20%, s/p ?biV AICD in [**2105**].
No evidence of frank pulmonary edema, hypotensive requiring pressors with CI 1.8->2.1, likely secondary to class III heart failure with EF of 20%.
# ESRD: etiology of [**Name (NI) 2091**] unclear(started HD [**10-18**]), s/p ultrafiltration [**2108-12-13**], ?stopped prematurely secondary to syncope and hypotension.
