PERTINENT STUDIES # Portable CXR [**8-17**] UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG.
Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is redemonstrated suggestive of a small pleural effusion.
# Portable CXR [**8-21**] INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with tachybrady syndrome status post dual-chamber pacemaker implant using the axillary vein.
# CXR PA/Lateral [**8-22**] FINDINGS: Lungs are well expanded.
The right lung shows chronic apical changes with scarring and nodular thickening of the apical pleura and a prominent minor fissure which are unchanged since at least [**2153-10-3**].
