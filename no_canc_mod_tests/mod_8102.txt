The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room for shortness of breath and tachypnea to a respiratory rate of approximately 42 per minute with vital signs at the nursing home of a temperature of 99.8, heart rate of 100 to 110, blood pressure 220/90 and 78 percent oxygen saturation on room air.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission were temperature of 103.8, heart rate 118, blood pressure 114/56, respiratory rate 30, oxygen saturation 96 percent on 2 liters.
On physical examination generally, this is an ill- appearing elderly male in mild distress on 100 percent nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, the pupils were equally round and reactive to light and icteric.
Pulmonary examination, there were rales bilaterally, left greater than right on the bases with diminished breathsounds bilaterally.
Abdominal examination was soft, mildly distended, hypoactive bowel sounds, nontender.
Rectal examination was heme negative.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's initial white blood cell count was 12.6, hematocrit 30.7, platelet count 129.
Initial chemistries revealed potassium 3.7, sodium 141, chloride 102, bicarbonate 21, BUN 50, creatinine 2.1, up from a baseline of 1.2, glucose 131, calcium 8.7, magnesium 2.5, phosphorus 2.5.
AST 64, ALT 40, alkaline phosphatase 202, total bilirubin 1.1, amylase 41, albumin 3.4.
A urinalysis was done which showed moderate leukocyte esterase, 30 protein, nitrates negative, trace ketones.
Blood cultures were drawn and are pending.
Urine culture was sent and a baseline Cortisol for a Cortrosyn stimulation test was done.
Electrocardiogram on admission showed sinus tachycardia at 100 with normal axis and an old Q in 3.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral hilar fluffiness, although the patient was rotated.
Early in the hospitalization a urine culture grew    out which showed gram negative rods, eventually speciated    to be Proteus.
Given the patient continuing spike    through antibiotics, as well as having acute renal    failure, a renal ultrasound was done which demonstrated    right hydronephrosis with multiple nonobstructing stones    in the right kidney as well as a left renal cyst.
For    this issue, Urology was consulted who recommended a    computerized axial tomography scan of the abdomen be done.
A computerized axial tomography scan done on [**4-1**] showed    an 8 mm obstructing right proximal ureteral calculus with    marked proximal hydroureter and hydronephrosis, bilateral    renal calculi, bilateral renal cysts with a right renal    cyst containing calcification, descending thoracic aortic    aneurysm and cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Renal issues - As noted above, the percutaneous    nephrostomy tube was placed at midnight for the Proteus    sepsis for the obstructing ureteral stone.
After the    nephrostomy tube was placed, the patient's hematocrit    decreased over the next two days from a hematocrit of 40    to 30 and then to 20.
For this issue, a repeat    computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was done which    showed a perinephric hematoma as well as signs of    retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Respiratory insufficiency - There is question of    aspiration pneumonia versus just aspiration.
