TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images of the chest were obtained without and with IV contrast per non-gated chest pain protocol.
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There has been interval decrease in size of the large right-sided pleural effusion, which now is moderate in size.
Diffuse bilateral opacities similar to prior study likely represent pulmonary edema.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Due to unstable hemodynamics and ventricular dysrhythmias, he was maintained on Dopamine and Lidocaine drips.
He urgently underwent chest CTA to rule out pulmonary embolus and a head CT to rule out stroke.
The head CT found no evidence of infarction or hemorrhage, and he ruled out for PE by CT angiogram.
The neurology service was consulted for further evaluation and EEG was performed.
The EEG showed generalized discharges and very little, if any normal background was seen.
