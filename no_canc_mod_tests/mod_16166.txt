His pulse on admission was 92 with a blood pressure of 106/80.
A CTA was done at the outside hospital that was negative for aortic injury, but the electrocardiogram showed anterior ST elevations, Qs in V1 and V2, right bundle branch block and left anterior vesicular block.
The patient was given nitro drip, heparin intravenous, intravenous beta blocker and transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.
Initial cardiac enzymes were negative at the outside hospital.
Hemodynamics in the cardiac laboratory showed a cardiac output suppressed at 3.10, a low index of 1.67, PA pressure of 31/18 with a wedge pressure of 22, the A wave being 23 and the V wave being 28, and a right ventricular pressure of 32/8.
His heart rate was 92 and sinus.
His blood pressure was 150/90.
Respiratory rate 17.
Good distal pulses with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and 2+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
Neurological examination not oriented to time or place.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's data from the outside hospital included a hematocrit of 47.4, white blood cell count 15.6, platelets 249.
The CKs at the outside hospital included a CK of 143 with an MB of 3.8, MB index of 2.7 and an troponin I of 0.22.
At [**Hospital1 69**] the patient's second CK came back at 6433 with an MB of 465 and MB index of 7.2 and a troponin greater then 50.
The patient's chem 7 included sodium 134, K 4.8, chloride 98, bicarb 20, BUN 21, creatinine 1.1 and glucose of 412.
He was also started on a beta blocker and an ace inhibitor and his cardiac enzymes were cycled.
Post cardiac catheterization the patient's anterior and lateral ST elevations did resolve with flattening of the ST segment.
After the CK peak of 6433 the patient's CK decreased to 2963 with an MB of 214.
Pump function:  The patient was noted on bed side echocardiogram after his cardiac catheterization to have severe increase in his ejection fraction with a estimated EF of 20%  The patient had a formal echocardiogram on the [**5-10**] that showed an ejection fraction between 20 and 30%.
The left ventricular wall thickness was seen to be normal.
His chest x-ray, which had initially showed failure cleared after diuresis and the patient required no further dosing of Lasix.
Diabetes:  The patient presented with blood sugars in the 400s.
His urine and serum were negative for ketones.
The hemoglobin A1C was checked that came back at 12.7 indicating the patient had diabetes undiagnosed for quite some time.
The patient was initially controlled with an intravenous insulin drip according to the [**Last Name (un) **] protocol and was then converted over to a sliding scale of regular insulin along with Glucophage 500 b.i.d.
Neurological:  As stated previously the patient was noted to be severely agitated during cardiac catheterization and subsequently in the Coronary Care Unit and on the floor.
To rule out causes of delirium the patient had blood cultures times two, urine cultures and analysis and a chest x-ray.
The patient also had a TSH checked, which was within normal limits and a B-12 level checked.
His TSH was within normal limits at 0.32.
