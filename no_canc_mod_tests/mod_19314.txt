Urine cx: c/w contamination  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 62528**] is a 25 yo man with new DM who presented in DKA.
(However, pt was drinking soda and juice as well as eating ice cream before presentation so may have driven glucose up higher than typical presentation.)
After discharge, his Cpeptide level came back as normal, which suggests DM2.
Anti-islet antibodies and GAD antibodies are pending at this time and will help to clarify the picture.
On admission, CXR was negative for any infiltrate, UA was negative for infection, and EKG showed no ischemic changes with cardiac enzymes negative x2.
The pt was treated with aggressive fluid hydration and insulin drip in the ICU with improvement of his glucose levels and closure of his anion gap.
By the last hospital day, the pt was able to check his own fingersticks and to draw up and administer his own insulin.
The pt was discharged with all diabetes materials, including lancets, glucometer, test strips, syringes, insulin, and ketostix.
