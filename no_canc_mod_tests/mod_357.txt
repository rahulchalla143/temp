PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8, heart rate 70, blood pressure 118/74, sating 96 percent on room air.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT RESULTS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.3 with 73 percent neutrophils.
Creatinine of 1.5.
CT of the legs showed skin thickening and subcutaneous stranding in the medial thigh corresponding to physical exam without underlying abscess, similar skin thickening and pronounced subcutaneous stranding and extensive soft tissue attenuation surrounding the prosthetic graft in the anterior lateral thigh also suspicious for infection, mottled and demineralized appearance of the femur likely related to disease.
After a couple days of dressing changes soaked in acetic acid, the patient's leg wound had a VAC dressing placed, which worked well for healing purposes.
Her chest x-ray did not have any CHF or pneumonia.
During her stay the patient did require blood transfusion which did cause a degree of heart failure and the need for Lasix.
Cardiac service was made involved at that time because during her blood transfusion her systolic blood pressure decreased and the patient went into a junctional escape rhythm requiring telemetry and close observation.
Patient was successfully revived and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further care.
Patient's ventilatory support was removed and by the evening of [**2137-2-4**] at 9:55 p.m. the patient expired with no blood pressure and no respiratory effort.
