GCS 15 upon arrival to OSH.
At the OSH, he had persistent hypertension with BP of 190/110.
Head CT showed L cerebellar hemorrhage and the patient was given 10mg of vitamin K for an INR of 1.9.
He was medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] and while on route to [**Hospital1 **] the patient deteriorated with a GCS of 7.
On admission he had an elevated Troponin of 0.3 which has been trending down, likely due to demand ischemia.
His a-fib has been successfully rate controlled with metoprolol.
Clinical exam has been stable and no hematoma expansion or transtentorial herniation was seen on repeat head CT.

Head Ct [**2159-7-24**]: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of large cerebellar hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mass effect on the pons.
Head CT [**2159-7-26**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Echo Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
His exam improved on his first hospital day to following commands and was able to be successfully extubated.
On admission he had an elevated Troponin of 0.3 which has been trending down, likely due to demand ischemia.
His initial INR was 2.3 which was reversed with vitamin K, FFP, and Factor VII.
His a-fib was successfully rate controlled with metoprolol.
He continued to have waxing / [**Doctor Last Name 688**] confusion, but neurologic examination was essentially stable.
Initially floor stay was complicated by difficult to control blood pressure with systolic blood pressures greater than 160 and intermittent worsening mental status, and new nystagmus, so he was transferred back to the ICU where he was placed on a Nicardipine drip.
Repeat head CT was stable, so he returned to the neuromedicine floor where he remained stable.
To further evaluate waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, chest X-ray and urine cultures were obtained with no sign of acute infection.
(Urine culture from indwelling foley likely contaminated, however repeat urine testing is pending.)
Echocardiogram in the hospital revealed poor ejection fraction of 25-30% and severely dilated left veintricle.
At the time of discharge to rehabilitation, he has been cleared by speech and swallow evaluation and is tolerating oral diet.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: Four (4) MG Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for n/v.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after you had nausea and headache and had a CT scan which showed a large bleeding stroke in your brain, in the cerebellum.
Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] of Neurosurgery in 4 weeks with a Head CT w/o contrast.
