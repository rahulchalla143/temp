She was brought to an outside hospital first where CT head was negative and a pelvic x-ray showed a pubic ramus fracture.
In the ED, initial vs were 5 98.1 80 98/52 18 98% 2L Nasal Cannula.
Trauma exam included rectal exam without blood.
CT torso showed no other signs of trauma but had "evidence of aspiration" so she was given Levofloxacin/Metronidazole.

CXR [**2126-5-31**]: No acute intrathoracic process or radiographic evidence of injury.
Please refer to subsequent CT torso for further details, including small right apical lung nodules.

EKG [**2126-6-1**]: Sinus rhythm.
RUQ ULTRASOUND [**2126-6-4**]: Focal liver lesions seen on recent CT correspond to simple hepatic cysts.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2126-6-4**]: 1.
MR HEAD [**2126-6-5**]: No acute infarct seen.
Limited study due to motion.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**2126-6-5**]: 1.
EEG [**2126-6-4**]: This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG because of intermittent generalized frontally dominant bursts of slowing with admixed sharp features.
If clinical concern for seizures is high, a 24 hour bedside EEG telemetry study is recommended.
With regards to the cause, seizure was investigated due to her presentation.
EEG and MR imaging of the head was performed and was not very suggestive of a seizure, but Neurology consult felt that a seizure is highly likely and probable given the history obtained.
Has not had a BMD scan (she has a clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis given this fracture).
After the operation on [**5-31**] she was noted to go into a fast heart rhythm (HR 140's); no EKG was done.
Labs revealed a Hct drop from 37.1 to 26.4.
Estimated blood loss was 200cc but it is possible that this was underestimated and that this was from hypovolemia.
Finally, other etiologies that were considered peri-operative MI but this was ruled out by EKG and serial troponins.
# Acute anemia: likely from blood loss, now Hct stable.
On [**5-31**], Hct fell from 37.1 to 26.4, then received 2u pRBC with repeat Hct 31.8.
The next day ([**6-1**]) she was noted to have Hct 25 so she received 2u pRBC with Hct increasing to 33.9.
Hct was stable by the time of discharge, and she did not require any more transfusions.
Hct was 32.8 on [**6-5**].
No need for further Hct checks unless any clinical concern for bleeding.
Though her plt dropped from 125 to 75, platelet level stabilized with plt 160 at the time of discharge.
WBC 12.9 on presentation (neutrophil predominance, no bands) but no signs and symptoms of infection (negative urinalysis and urine cultures, blood cultures with no growth to date, and clear CXR).
Initial leukocytosis might have represented a stress response from her fracture.
Besides her episode of hypotension (see above) she did require her antihypertensive medications and her blood pressure was reasonably controlled.
