Despite an aggressive workup during the involvement of many specialists, they were unable to pinpoint the exact etiology of the problem.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient was afebrile with vital signs stable, sating 93% on room air.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, however, breath sounds were slightly decreased, no wheezes noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 68 year old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malnutrition, lower extremity ulcerations of unknown etiology who presented to the Thoracic Surgery Service for further evaluation and treatment of multiple problems.
On hospital day #2, the patient went for chest x-ray which demonstrated no definite pneumonia or cardiac failure, prominence of the right aortic contour concerning for ascending aortic aneurysm.
The patient then went for a computerized tomography scan on hospital day #3 which revealed head computerized tomography scan which showed no intracranial pathological process, computerized tomography scan of the torso which demonstrated no evidence of malignancy, diffuse extensive emphysema with small peripheral patchy opacities, extensive vasculopathy with suggestion of infrarenal aortic stenosis and post traumatic dilatation, an ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 4.2 cm and a prominent left adrenal gland.
Pulmonary consultation evaluating the patient's pulmonary function tests were performed which demonstrated severe emphysematous pattern consistent with the patient's disease process.
Psychiatry recommended Haldol prn for agitation and also recommended checking TSH, B12 and Folate levels which were all normal.
Also on [**2167-2-24**], the patient was seen by the Dermatology Service who made an assessment of vasculitis of unknown origin or an embolic phenomenon.
Two punch biopsies were taken at this time, one from the right lower extremity and one from the left index finger and these were sent to Pathology for further analysis.
They reviewed the computerized tomography scan which was normal and had no recommendations at this time.
On [**2167-2-25**], Vascular Surgery saw Mr. [**Known lastname 25699**], recommendations included noninvasive arterial studies of the lower extremities which demonstrated significant arterial disease on the right lower extremity with flexions of 9 and 6 at the ankle and metatarsal areas respectively on the right lower extremity.
In addition, computerized tomography scan was evaluated and infrarenal narrowing of the aorta was noted but thought to be subclinical.
Up until this point the patient had a white count that was hovering between 20 and 24.
Skin cultures at this point came back only positive for Corynebacteria.
Blood cultures have been negative to date.
The patient was also recommended to have Clostridium difficile sent off which all were negative.
On [**2167-2-28**], the patient's punch biopsy by Dermatology returned negative for vasculitis in the lower extremity biopsy sample, but the left index finger was positive for vasculitis with definite changes in the small/medium sized arteries.
Plastic Surgery evaluated the patient and made no recommendations at this time, hoping for the patient's ulcerations to heal slightly prior to repeat evaluation assessment as an outpatient.
Secondary to the patient's persistent high white count the patient was sent for bone scan to rule out osteomyelitis and on [**2167-3-2**] the patient was sent and test was negative.
Additional laboratory data were sent off including ESR, CRPNA which were all negative.
Ultram 50 to 100 mg p.o.
