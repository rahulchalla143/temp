He underwent a stress test in [**3-5**] which was positive and then underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel disease with moderate aortic stenosis.
He remained stable and a followup catheterization on [**10-7**] revealed progression of his coronary disease with new occlusive disease of the right artery.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The maximum gradient across the aortic valve is 8 mm Hg with a mean gradient of 4 mm Hg with a cardiac output of 7 liters/minute.

This included an echocardiogram which revealed slightly impaired left ventricular function and moderate aortic stenosis ( [**Location (un) 109**] ~1.1 cm, gradient 35 mmHg).
Carotid ultrasound demonstrated no significant lesions.
His creatinine which was mildly elevated chronically at 1.5, rose to 2 after surgery, where it remained.
His INR was 1.2 at discharge and he will take 4 mg [**10-17**] and 21.
He will have a PT/INR drawn on [**10-19**] with results sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6051**] for regulation, with a target INR of [**1-29**].5.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: as ordered Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): INR target 2-2.5.
