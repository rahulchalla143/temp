Cardiac workup included a nuclear stress test that showed no evidence of ischemia.
Further cardiac workup included cardiac angiogram that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
An epiaortic scan was performed which confirmed dilated aorta with no significant atheromatous disease at canullation or cross clamp location.
The study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring on Propofol and phenylephrine infusions.
All chest tubes, invasive lines and epicardial  pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol and without complication.
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5.
The cardiac surgery office will also arrange a chest CT scan with contrast in approximately one year time to re-evaluate his dilated ascending aorta.
