Her cardiac enzymes were negative (CK 24, trop <0.01), but she received a Plavix load and was started on heparin and integrillin gtts and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab for emergent cardiac catheterization for STEMI.
Her VS prior to transfer included BP 105/75 and SaO2 97% on 3L.
On arrival to the cath lab here, her ECG was felt to be more consistent with pericarditis.
Cardiac cath was cancelled, and urgent pericardiocentesis was not done.
Her symptoms included nasal congestion and rhinitis, as well as anorexia, but she denies any cough, rash, fevers, chills, sweats, arthralgias, or myalgias.

======================================================== Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2128-7-27**] at 6:17:09 PM There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2128-7-28**] at 2:48:59 PM The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-7-27**], the pericardial effusion has largely resolved.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2128-7-29**] at 3:10:53 PM The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
However, on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ECG felt to be more consistent with pericarditis.
A stat TTE showed small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion (~2cm in subcostal view, anterior to the RV) with sustained RA collapse c/w low filling pressures or early tamponade, and RV collapse could not be excluded.
Cardiac cath was cancelled, and urgent pericardiocentesis was performed.
Post-procedure ECHO demonstrated trivial pericardial effusion and ECHO 24 hrs post-procedure demonstrated small pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.
Given etiology of effusion unclear patient tested for HIV, lyme, mycoplasma, respiratory viral and antigen which were all negative.
Adenovirus and [**Location (un) **] virus serologies pending at time of discharge.
Pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells.
Pericardial fluid sent for culture which is preliminarily no growth at time of discharge.
She would need a repeat ECHO if her symptoms of chest discomfort recurred.
Her cardiac enzymes were negative both at the OSH and on admission.
Her ECHO showed EF >55%.
She was volume resucitated with IVF and creatinine improved back to 1 which is within her baseline range (0.8-1.0).
# Leukocytosis: Patient had leukocytosis on admission with WBC ct of 15.
WBC ct trended to normal range.
Notably, blood sugars were elevated on this admission and her HbA1c is 10.1.
She will need to have her blood sugars monitored and medication changes made as needed.
# Dyslipidemia: Patient's LDL 36, HDL 65, total 110, trig 43.
# Anemia: iron studies indicate iron deficiency anemia given iron level of 18.
Would consider further work-up as an outpatient, especially colonoscopy if she is not UTD, and would also consider starting an iron supplement.
Please call your doctor immediately if you develop any symptoms of shortness of breath, lightheadedness or dizziness, syncope, worsening lower extremity edema, or weight gain of > 3 lbs (weigh yourself daily).
