When she got to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital she was anemic with hematocrit of 24 and thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 25,000.
Hematology was consulted at that point and LDH was increased.
MRI and MRA demonstrated atherosclerotic changes of intracranial carotids, right greater than left, but no stroke.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 32495**] began plasmapheresis on [**8-5**], though during her first episode she developed hypotension with systolic blood pressure to the 80's, responded to fluid boluses and she was also hypocalcemic at the time.
On [**8-10**] she completed a course of plasmapheresis, her platelets had maxed at 238,000 and her LDH was 271.
She was cultured and blood cultures grew coag negative staph aureus four bottles and the patient was started on Vancomycin.
She had an HIT positive antibody at that time.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She had temperature 98.9, blood pressure 150/70, pulse 85, respirations 20, 95% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  She had a white count of 8.3, hematocrit 29.9, platelet count 35, PT 13.6, PTT 26 and INR 1.1, d dimer greater than 1,000, FTP between 10 and 40, SMA 10 was within normal limits.
Head CT on the [**8-3**] was negative.
Head CT on [**8-4**] showed no acute blood.
The patient had a hematocrit of 29.9 and platelet count 35 and white appeared to be a TIA, so it was believed that patient was suffering from TTP.
The patient developed a plasmapheresis on [**8-5**] at which point she became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure to the 80's and hypocalcemia.
The patient's platelets came up to 238,000, LDH came down to 271 on [**8-12**], though it was noted that the patient's platelets were decreasing again.
LDH was rising and haptoglobin was low.
On subsequent exam on [**8-12**], the patient developed a fever to 101.5 with coag negative staph in [**4-26**] bottles from the blood.
Creatinine ranged from 0.9 to 1.1.
Troponin maxed at 1.7 and patient was treated with increased beta blockers.
