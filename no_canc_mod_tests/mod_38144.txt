If her hematuria were to recur a CT cystogram was recommended.
Her hematocrit remained stable in the 24-26 range and she remained hemodynamically stable.
Serial chest xrays were followed and her hemothorax resolved.
Her chest tube was removed on [**7-6**] and her post pull film showed a small residual apical pneumothorax which was noted on a previous film, other than that  was stable.
