MAJOR PROCEDURES:  Magnetic resonance imaging scan of brain, angiogram of head and neck.
Magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a right paramedian basis pontis and upper medulla stroke as well as basilar artery stenosis.
Conventional angiogram showed multifocal stenosis of the left vertebral artery and a 5 mm aneurysm arising from the anterior communicating artery was incidentally found.
Follow up magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed extension with brain stem stroke attributed to basilar stenosis.
