Although his systolic blood pressure remains intermittently in the high-normal range of 85-90 mmHg, he has had no further systolic peaks above 100, and it was not felt that the finding was pathologic.
Blood pressure should be monitored at each pediatric visit, with further evaluation undertaken if it increases inappropriately.

The culture was final with no growth on [**2153-9-10**], day of life number six.
