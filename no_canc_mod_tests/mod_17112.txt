CT showed a left cerebellar hemorrhage.
Her INR was supratherapeutic on admission at 4.
Blood pressure was carefully monitored.
Serial CT scans have been stable.
CT remained stable and the drain was removed on [**2171-3-26**].
CTA and MRI of the head with contrast did not clearly show underlying mass.
Repeat MRI/MRS [**Last Name (STitle) **] attempted to further assess possibility of underlying mass lesion and studies were limited, showing evolving hemorrhage stable in size.
Repeat CT head in 6 weeks has been arranged and follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
CTA was negative for PE but did reveal a right lower lobe mass measuring 2.2 x 2.2 cm and smaller left upper lobe 3 mm nodule with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
