She was also found to have had a non ST elevation myocardial infarction with peak troponin I of 14.2 and peak CK of 569.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.
Catheterization was performed on [**12-13**] and revealed mitral regurgitation, 50% ejection fraction, normal left main, diffuse disease of the left anterior descending coronary artery with a 70% mid lesion and occluded left circumflex after the obtuse marginal one and a mid to distal 70% lesion of the right coronary artery with a probable thrombus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination she is a pleasant obese woman with a temperature of 97, heart rate 85, blood pressure 114/58, 18 respirations and satting 96% on 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen.
She was alert and oriented times three and grossly intact neurologically and peripheral pulses were present throughout carotid, radial, dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  Recommendations were sent that the laboratory work be completed prior to preparation for cardiac surgery.
White blood cell count 15.1, hematocrit 33.0, platelet count 405,000, sodium 137, K 4.7, chloride 100, bicarb 28, BUN 17, creatinine 1.1 with a blood sugar of 149, calcium 9.5, phosphorus 4.1, magnesium 1.9.
Preoperative pulmonary medicine consultation was performed on [**12-17**] who noted the persistent bronchitis and probable bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The CT scan showed some evidence of emphysema with a question of bronchiectasis.
White blood cell count on [**12-18**] was still 15, but the plan was to have the patient to undergo surgery on Thursday.
Blood pressure was 103/49.
The patient was in sinus rhythm, slightly tachycardic at 99 with a cardiac index of 2.0.
Postoperatively on day one the white blood cell count rose to 29, hematocrit remained at 26.8 and creatinine was 1.3.
The examination was otherwise unremarkable.
A repeat chest x-ray was obtained.
On postoperative day two the patient was transferred out to the floor with a blood pressure of 130/80, respiratory rate 20, sating 96% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
White blood cell count was 23.4, hematocrit 23.8 and creatinine of 1.4.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells on postoperative day four the hematocrit dropped to 4.0 later in the day.
The patient remained in sinus rhythm in the 80s with a blood pressure of 140/70, satting well, 97% on room air.
Abdominal examination was benign.
Creatinine dropped to 0.9.
White blood cell count dropped to 18.4 and hematocrit rose slowly post transfusion to 29.5.
On [**12-27**] the patient's examination revealed the patient was still in sinus rhythm with a temperature max of 99.2, heart rate 78, blood pressure 135/80, respiratory rate 18, satting 95% on room air.
Laboratories prior to discharge had a white blood cell count of 17.6, hematocrit 30.4, platelet count had risen to 733,000, sodium 137, K 4.0, chloride 99, bicarb 29, BUN 24, creatinine 0.9 with a blood sugar of 196.
On examination the patient's lungs were clear bilaterally.
Abdominal examination was benign.
The patient was instructed to reassess blood sugars with primary care physician in approximately one week Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54095**] and also to follow up with the patient's cardiolgoist in approximately two to three weeks post discharge.
