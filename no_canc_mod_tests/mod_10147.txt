EKG [**2175-2-15**]- reviewed by me, demonstrates afib, vent rate in 100s.
compared to EKG dated [**2173-10-11**].
Surgery was consulted and a stat CT abd/pelvis with contrast was significant for bladder perforation.
A CT cystogram confirmed these findings and the patient was taken emergently to the OR by urology for exlap with closure of the bladder over a portion of the peritoneum with a placement of a JP drain.
He became transiently hypotensive during the case and required the initiation of neosynephrine gtt to maintain SBPs > 100.
He was monitored in the ICU setting for > 24 hrs to ensure hemodynamic stability and to monitor output from his JP drain and foley.
Unfortunately, a urine culture was not sent but blood cultures came back positive for GNR resistant to fluoroquinolones.
Subsequently, the pt did not have any fevers and WBC trended down.
Hypothyroidism [**3-4**] oversuppression with methimazole was considered and a TSH was checked that was wnl.
EKG was without ischemic changes.
CXR was negative for pneumonia.
Most recent TFTs [**1-7**]- normal TSH 2.5, fT4 1.2, TT3 105.
Repeat TSH while in house was wnl.
