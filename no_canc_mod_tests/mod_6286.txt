Telemetry showed a sinus rate of 48 with up to four segment pauses which spontaneously resolved and then recurred again.
The patient's systolic blood pressure was in the upper 40s during these episodes, but otherwise stayed in the 100s to 120s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient's temperature was 97.6 F, pulse 67, blood pressure 150/60 and a respiratory rate of 18.
Oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.
On general exam she was awake in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam showed pupils to be equal, round and reactive.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Deep tendon reflexes were 1+ and symmetric and her toes were downgoing.
LABORATORY:  On admission her CBC had a white blood cell count of 6.7 with a hematocrit of 38 and platelets of 374,000.
Sodium is 122, potassium 4.2, chloride 107, bicarbonate 27.
BUN of 68 and creatinine of 1.1.
Glucose 202.
Calcium 9.7, phosphate 3.5, magnesium 2.0.
ALT 18, AST 76, alkaline phosphatase 72.
Her initial CK MB and troponin were negative.
A head CT Scan showed no abnormalities.
Abdominal CT Scan showed no abnormalities except cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Her EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 70 with a normal axis and normal intervals without any ST changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's loss of consciousness and sodium of 122, the patient was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for overnight monitoring, but was sent to the Medicine floor the next day.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient's initial blood pressure were elevated.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and telemetry revealed no more pauses or episodes of bradycardia.
The patient's initial enzymes were negative.
Given the absence of chest pain and the lack of EKG changes, a myocardial infarction is considered unlikely and no further enzymes were checked.
An echocardiogram was done on [**9-19**] to rule out cardiac dysfunction.
It showed a normal right atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, left ventricle with an ejection fraction of greater than 55% and mild thickening of the mitral valve leading to decreased relaxation of the valve.
The patient's blood pressures remained slightly elevated and she was restarted on her Accupril three days after admission which stabilized her blood pressures.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient admits that her sugars have been poorly controlled at home with often low sugars in the morning and high sugars at lunch.
Hemoglobin A1c was checked and the level was 8.3.
Given the appearance of old compression fractures on initial chest x-ray, the patient was given a prescription for Ergocalciferol 400 units q.d.
She was put on free water restriction and the sodium the next morning was 132 and has remained in the low 130s since.
Random Cortisol was checked which was 23.
The right apical density in her lung was evaluated with a chest CT Scan which showed two calcified granulomas in the right apex.
She will likely need antidepressant medication, however no new medication was started during the hospitalization.
Lorazepam 0.5 to 1 mg p.o.
