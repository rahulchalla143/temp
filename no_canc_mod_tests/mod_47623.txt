Respiratory failure - On [**2153-5-20**], the patient had an acute worsening of his respiratory failure with a temperature of 101.7, respiratory rate in the 40s.
Eventually his gram negative rods grew out of his sputum which were speciated as Enterobacter and Pseudomonas.
Hypotension - The patient became hypotensive again on [**5-21**], thought secondary to pneumonia and sepsis.
He was initially on pressors, however, we were able to wean off of the Levophed, and with broad-spectrum antibiotics his blood pressure improved and he is maintaining MAPs in the 50s and 60s off all of blood pressure medications.
However, with maintaining the INRs in the 2.5 to 3 range, he has maintained his hematocrit as stable and he has not had any further intra-abdominal bleeding.
Mitral valve replacement/atrial fibrillation - The patient requires anticoagulation for prosthetic valve as well as atrial fibrillation.
Should his INR get above 3, Coumadin needs too be decreased because he has had large intra-abdominal bleeds in the setting of INR greater than 3.
Upon further improvement, he will need a repeat speech and swallow evaluation to dictate whether or not p.o.
Prophylaxis - The patient will be discharged on Coumadin and Lansoprazole proton pump inhibitor.
q.h.s., INR goal 2.5 to 3.
