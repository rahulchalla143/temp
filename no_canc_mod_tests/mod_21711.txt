The neck of the femur and the head appear to be intact.
EKG [**3-23**]: Sinus rhythm First degree A-V block Probable septal infarct - age undetermined Possible left atrial enlargement No previous tracing  CXR [**3-23**]:  AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: IMPRESSION: 1.
Dedicated PA and Lateral views of the chest are recommended when the patient is clinically capable for further characterization.
Alternatively, CT could be obtained.
EKG [**3-24**]:  Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-3-23**] multiple abnormalities as previously noted persist without major change.
CXR [**3-25**]:  IMPRESSION: Rounded opacity in the retrocardiac region which appears contiguous with the heart and probably represents a left ventricular aneurysm.
A CT scan is recommended for further evaluation.
HIP PA and LAT [**3-26**]:  IMPRESSION: Status post ORIF right intertrochanteric fracture in overall anatomic alignment.
CT HEAD [**3-26**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or infarct on this limited study.
MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive to evaluate for an acute infarct.
CT CHEST [**3-26**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
Given the history of aspiration, evaluation by upper GI series may be useful after evacuation of the debris within the esophagus for further characterization of the anatomic course of the esophagus and stomach.
Follow-up examination after appropriate treatment is recommended.
Transthoracic echo [**3-26**]:  Conclusions: 1.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).

1) Hip fracture:  The patient had an ORIF on [**3-24**], with estimated blood loss of 200 cc.
She received 800 cc IVF, and her post-op hct was found to be 28.7 (down from 33) therefore she was transfused 1 UPRBC and her hematocrit subsequently remained stable.
Post operatively, however, she was noted to have a sinus tachycardia of 110-120, with stable blood pressure.
She was started on metoprolol 5 mg IV Q 6 hours (couldn't take PO meds - see below), and her heart rate remained in the 70s and 80s for the remainder of the hospitalization.
Her brief post-operative tachycardia was likely related to her anemia, anxiety, and post-operative state with pain.
However, an echo did not demonstrate an aneurysm.
A CT scan was done to better evaluate the mass, which demonstrated a dilated esophagus filled with food, as well as a likely hiatal hernia to explain the mass.
As swallow study was done which demonstrated the patient to be aspirating food of all consistency.
The family agreed to placing a PICC for TPN for the next 2 weeks, after which time the patient will have a repeat CT scan to see if the food has slowly moved on its own enabling GI to do another scope to further evaluate the obstruction.
She will also have a repeat swallow study at that time to see if the oropharyngeal component of her dysphagia has resolved.
6) Aspiration pneumonia:  Multiple areas of consolidation were seen on her CT scan, consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
EGD on [**4-4**] revealed that the esophageal blockage had resolved.
CXR c/w worsening pulm edema.
