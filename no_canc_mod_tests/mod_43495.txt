There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Brief Hospital Course: 1. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response -- Monitored on telemetry throughout course.
A TSH was normal, and free T4 slightly low, but unlikely a cause of her arrhythmia.
She had a cdiff sample sent and this was negative.
5. duodenitis -- incidental finding on CT imaging on admission.
Initially, there was some concern this may be related to c. difficile, however there was little clinical evidence as diarrhea resolved and WBC count normalized.
Further evaluation for resolution of the duodenitis may be indicated, by imaging or EGD, and will be deferred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Vascular congestion on CXR - pt.
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: To begin on [**2124-11-23**] Monitor INR daily, levels to be adjusted by MD.
You will need to take a blood thinner to prevent stroke in the future (coumadin).
You will need to get your blood checked often while on coumadin, to assure it is thinned properly.
