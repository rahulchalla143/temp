Urine grew Klebsiella and E. coli although the patient reported "chronic UTIs" and it is unclear whether she had thrombocytopenia (platelets 60's) so the Hematology Service was consulted.
Chest x-ray on [**4-30**] showed a left infiltrate with effusion, and borderline congestive heart failure.
Follow-up x-rays showed worsening of the infiltrate and effusion and aspiration pneumonia was suspected, so Flagyl was begun on [**5-7**].
Her TSH was elevated (felt to be secondary to amiodarone) and her Synthroid was increased from 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg q. day.
Baseline creatinine [**12-22**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.7 degrees, blood pressure 140/60, pulse 54, respiratory rate 22, oxygenation 98% on two liters.
Dorsalis pedis pulses not palpable.
Photographs in chart from [**Hospital1 33995**] documented.
Motor examination limited by hip fracture.
LABORATORY [**5-12**] FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  PT 14.2, INR 1.3, sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 107, bicarb 18, BUN 56, creatinine 2.7, glucose 137, calcium 7.7, magnesium 2.3, phosphorus 2.6, triglycerides 117.
[**5-11**]:  White blood cell count 6.2, hematocrit 32.6, platelet count 153,000.
Total bilirubin 0.42.
ALT 36, CK 96, LDH 222, total protein 5.1, albumin 2.4.
Micro:  Clostridium difficile negative on [**5-6**] and [**5-8**].
Urine culture negative on [**5-11**].
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray on [**5-7**]:  Left lower lobe infiltrate with effusion.
Labs on the first day at [**Hospital1 188**]:  White count 7.3, hematocrit 34.5, platelet count 149,000.
A chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 69**] showed cardiomegaly with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema.
An orthopedic consult was obtained on the date of admission with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] being the attending surgeon.
The patient's lung examination was concerning for crackles half the way up on the left and one-third up on the right.
Given this finding along with the chest x-ray findings, it was recommended that the CHF Service would consult.
The goal for diuresis would be one to two liters per day and to follow the oxygenation lung examination and chest x-ray.
The patient's lung examination had not improved.
Repeat chest x-ray showed persistent congestive heart failure with effusions as described above.
Upon further discussion, the patient agreed to go to the Coronary Care Unit for intracardiac monitoring during her diuresis and on [**2150-5-18**], she was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.
Chest x-ray findings suggested a potential aspiration pneumonia.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained that showed an ejection fraction of less than 20%, moderate dilation of the right atrium.
Left wall motion:  The following resting regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities were seen:  Basal inferior - akinetic; mid inferior - akinetic; basal inferolateral - akinetic; mid inferolateral - akinetic; inferior apex - akinetic; lateral apex - akinetic.
In the Coronary Care Unit a pulmonary artery catheter was placed in the left subclavian with CVP 25, PA pressure 57/28, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 30, cardiac output 6.6, cardiac index 3.9, SVR 21.
Due to the patient's decreased SVR, the patient was pan cultured for a question of sepsis.
[**2150-5-20**]:  The patient's levofloxacin and Flagyl was discontinued after cultures showed no growth and the chest x-ray was most consistent with congestive heart failure.
Of note, at this time the patient's platelet count was 81,000, creatinine 3.2.
[**2150-5-23**]:  The patient's Natrecor and Lasix drip were discontinued as it was felt by the primary team as well as the CHF Service that the patient was back to her baseline dry weight of 65.5 kilograms and her lung examination had improved.
This was confirmed by chest x-ray as well.
