MRSA was found on sputum culture (but no white count and no fever), and vancomycin was started (now day #5).
The day prior to transfer, she developed a low-grade temperature to 99.3 axillary with systolic blood pressures in the 80's.
Her beta blocker and calcium channel blocker (which she is on because of atrial fibrillation with RVR) were discontinued, and her rhythm converted into atrial fibrillation with RVR.
She was given 2 liters of IVF with improvement of her blood pressure to the 110's, she was loaded with digoxin, and her beta blocker was restarted (at a lower dose) on the day of transfer.
Of note, her sugars have been difficult to manage, so she was placed on an insulin gtt.
History of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF greater than 55% with mild LVH, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of greater than 18, 1+ MR).

CXR: This is compared with prior study from [**2180-2-14**].
She was sent for a trach after her INR trended down to <1.5 and tolerated this without difficulty.
Her sedation was weaned and she tolerated a switch from AC ventilation to PS 15/10 FiO2 40% TV ~500.
Her BP remained well controlled even with rate control of her afib.
She was initally placed on a heparin drip and her INR allowed to trend downwards for her trach/PEG.
After the procedure her heparin was restarted and she was bridged to a therapeutic INR on coumadin.
Her INR was 2.0 on the day of discharge and the heparin was stopped.
She should have her coumadin titrated to maintain her INR between [**2-27**].
