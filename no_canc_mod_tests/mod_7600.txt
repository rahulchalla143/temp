The patient is status post cardiac catheterization on [**2192-3-5**], for exertional angina and chest tightness with radiation to his jaw and arms.
At that time he had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%, a right-dominant system with 3-vessel disease, showing a discrete 90% right left ventricular lesion, a 20% to 30% proximal left anterior descending artery, 70% D1, 60% D2, and 90% to 95% ramus intermedius lesion.
He had a previous exercise stress test in [**2191-11-16**] in an outside system that showed possibly inferior ischemia.
Electrocardiogram there showed a paced rhythm.
His blood pressure dropped to 50/32.
He was given IV fluids with his blood pressure recovering.
Again, the patient was started on a nitroglycerin drip, but his systolic blood pressure dropped to the 80s, and nitroglycerin was discontinued.
The patient was started on heparin and Integrilin with an initial creatine kinase of 247, and a MB fraction of 30, and a MB index of 12%.
His troponin was less than 0.3.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further care.
Temperature of 97.7, heart rate of 60, blood pressure of 121/67, respiratory rate of 17.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGY:  Electrocardiogram on admission showed a rate of 60 with atrial ventricular pacing.
Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure, no effusions, and no consolidations.
Troponin was less than 0.3.
Serial creatine kinases were 174 with a MB index of 6%, 111 with a MB of 6, and 129.
He had a white blood cell count of 6.8, hematocrit of 45, platelets of 243.
His lipid levels were checked and were found to be in good range.
