Final cholangiogram did not reveal any filling defects.
Given her extensive medical history/co-morbidities which included end stage renal disease in conjunction with congestive heart failure, she was admitted to the SICU for close monitoring of her fluid status and further management of her biliary disease.
Her Coumadin was held, and she underwent a R. upper quadrant ultrasound which demonstrated findings consistent with both choledocolithiasis and cholecystitis.
However at that time her INR remained elevated at 5.6 and she required another 4 units of FFP while on dialysis, in addition to 10 of Vitamin K+ in order to normalize her to an INR of 1.6.
As the patient's INR was normalized to 1.2, a sphincterotomy was safely performed, with removal of several biliary stones in addition to the common bile duct stent.
At the conclusion of the procedure, retrograde cholangiogram was negative for filling defects.
However, post-procedure her serum bilirubin levels remained elevated for several days, with a slow down-trend despite negative hemolysis work-up, and no complaint of further abdomina pain, nausea, or vomiting.
A R. upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained on hospital day 7 (post-procedure day 2 following second ERCP) to rule out liver abscess as a possible cause of persistently elevated bilirubin.
Hepatitis serologies were negative for infection.
The ERCP team was again consulted, and did not believe a repeat procedure to be warranted as they believed the elevated bilirubin levels to be secondary to accumulation from prior biliary obstruction and slow clearance due to the patient's severe renal dysfunction.
Additionally, beginning on hospital day 6 the patient had multiple bouts of diarrhea and stool samples returned positive for C. diff colitis.
As WBC count was not elevated, the patient was initially treated with oral Flagyl alone.
The patient was stabilized on this regimen with a gradual down-trend in her serum bilirubin levels and a decrease in her diarrhea.
As her diarrhea had demonstrated significant improvement and her WBC count remained within normal limits, IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin were discontinued and she was discharged with PO Flagyl 500mg q8hrs.
INR prior to discharge was 1.5  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Known lastname **] in clinic during the week following discharge and re-evaluation of liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.
