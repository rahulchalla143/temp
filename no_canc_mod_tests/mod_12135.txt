+ weight loss, unsure of how much, but has noticed pants and shirts fitting differently.
CXR showed a left pleural effusion, and UA showed a UTI which was initially treated with vanc/levo/flagyl to cover possible pneumonia and UTI.
Electrolytes showed non-gap metabolic acidosis on VBG.

RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 9.9 cm.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-30**], there is little change.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-29**], there is again increased opacification at the left base consistent with some combination of effusion, atelectasis, and pneumonia.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is nodular and coarsened in echotexture consistent with underlying cirrhosis.
Two hypoechoic lesions within the right hepatic lobe concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma for which further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 714**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1833**] on [**2190-11-30**] at 5 p.m.
No pneumothorax, though evaluation of the left apex is limited by patient head positioning.
NASH cirrhosis, DM, HTN, AS s/p AVR here w/ Klebsiella bacteremia, CNNA and ARF, initially admitted to the ICU and subsequently transferred to the floor.
Urine cultures grew pansensitive E. coli and Klebsiella sensitive to all but nitrofurantoin.
#Klebsiella Bacteremia- Patients blood culture grew out Klebsiella.
Patients subsequent blood cultures had no growth and her blood pressure remained stable.
Patient had an abdominal ultrasound which showed nodular and coarsened echotexture of the liver consistent with cirrhosis and had a moderate amount of ascites.
A paracentesis was done which showed 767 polys and the culture was negative.
She will complete a 2 week course of Ceftriaxone for the peritonitis which will be done [**12-15**].
# ARF: Patient intially had a creatinine of 2.1 on admission.
A renal ultrasound was unremarkable.
The midrodrine, octreotide and albumin were discontinued.
Patients creatinine slowly improved during her stay as her bacteremia resolved.
Her creatinine was 1.6 on discharge.
No further intervention was felt necessary, however patient will need closer follow up of her creatinine before she has an MRI.
When she began her PO diet, her sugars were noted to be in the 400s.
# Liver Lesions: Abd U/S showed two hypoechoic lesions within the right hepatic lobe concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma for which further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
An AFP was 2.7.
An MRI was not done because the patient had acute renal failure and her creatinine had not come down enough before discharge.
She will need an MRI with contrast once her creatinine improves.
C. diff cultures were negative x3.
Insulin Regular Human 100 unit/mL Cartridge Sig: One (1) 11U QAM, 2U QHS Injection once a day: Please get 11U insulin QAm and 2U QHS.
MRI Pt needs to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and have him order an MRI with gadolinium to evaluate liver lesions   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Urosepsis Peritonitis Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: Improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a bacterial infection.
We were unable to get an MRI of your liver because one of your labs called Creatinine was elevated which measures your kidney function.
You will need to wait to get the MRI until this creatinine improved to characterize these lesions.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] per your scheduled appointment on [**12-22**] at 3:30pm  Pt will need an MRI once creatinine improves to evaluate the lesions found on her liver on ultrasound.
