Brief Hospital Course: In the ED, she was seen by podiatry, who probed her wound to bone, obtained wound and blood cultures, and ordered Chem 10, CBC, coags, lactate, ESR, and foot xray.
A culture of the wound grew levo-resistant Group B strep, MSSA, and diptheroids.
Although her white count was intermittently elevated, the erythema was stable, as was her temperature.
[**Month/Year (2) **] surgery was then consulted:  [**Month/Year (2) **] procedures:  [**11-9**] - Diagnostic abdominal aortogram and pelvic arteriogram with unilateral lower extremity runoff, contralateral third order catheterization, primary balloon angioplasty of the anterior tibialis x 3.
2) Acute on chronic renal failure: Ms. [**Known lastname 8884**] had had a prior nephrectomy for secondary FSGS and a perinephric abscess.
On admission, her baseline creatinine was around 3.0-3.5.
She was admitted with a creatinine of 3.9, which rose to 5.5.
Renal function - ESRD .
Na, bp volume - cont lopressor, lisinopril .
Potassium - low k diet, 3.5 k bath .
Acid base - 35 bicarb bath at hd .
Renal replacement - hd today 3 1/2 hrs 350 qb goal 1 kg uf .
Her oxygen saturation fell to 92% on room air on [**1-9**], and she was put on 2L oxygen by nasal cannula with improvement to 99%.
A CXR was c/w volume overload.
By the afternoon of [**1-9**], her oxygen saturation was adequate on room air, and she denied further symptoms.
A DFA came back negative for VZV on [**1-11**], and acyclovir was discontinued.
Her finger sticks were monitored [**Hospital1 **], and then changed to QID for tighter control on an insulin sliding scale.
6) 5 point hematocrit drop- From [**1-6**] to [**1-7**], patient's hematocrit dropped from 29.8 to 24.0.
A haptoglobin, LDH, and TBili were not consistent with a hemolytic process.
2 units pRBCs were given [**1-7**] with an appropriate response, and she experienced no further drop in hematocrit.
To note pt did have an angiogram on [**11-9**].
On Dc HCt is stable .
She had an exacerbation on [**1-4**] at night, but responded to albuterol inhaler with no further exacerbations.
She is on warfarin, and was admitted with a supratherapeutic INR at 3.9 that rose to 4.5.
She was given vitamin K and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma with correction of her INR to 1.3.
Pt restarted on her coumadin On Dc her INR is 1.6 .
11) Hypertriglyceridemia: A lipid panel was ordered which showed trigglycerides 294, cholesterol 167, and LDL 89.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**11-29**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed.
The skin over the wound is left open so the deep tissues may heal before the skin is allowed to heal.
The VAC:  _ helps keep the wound tissue clean  _ absorbs drainage  _ prevents premature healing of skin  - promotes healing  When to Call the Doctor:  Watch for the following signs and symptoms and notify your doctor if these occur:  Temperature over 101.5 F or chills  Foul-smelling drainage or fluid from the wound  Increased redness or swelling of the wound or skin around it  Increasing tenderness or pain in or around the wound   Followup Instructions: Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] SURGERY (NHB) Date/Time:[**2108-2-10**] 2:30  Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] CALL Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 59**] Date/Time:[**2108-2-21**] 9:30  Provider:  [**Name10 (NameIs) 676**] CLINIC Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 59**] Date/Time:[**2108-5-21**] 9:00    Completed by:[**2108-1-27**
