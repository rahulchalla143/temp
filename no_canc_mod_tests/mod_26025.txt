At rehab on [**2156-8-28**], she had a temperature of 101, and she may hvae had abdominal tenderness per physician's exam (she grimaced with abdominal exam).
On arrival to the ED her initial VS were T99.4, HR 122, BP 122/71, RR 18, Sat 98%.
On exam she was noted to have a nontender abdomen, a maculopapular rash on her face (which her parents said has been going on for weeks) and very cloudy urine.
Preliminary read of the CT scan of her head (which was done with and without contrast at the request of neurosurgery) did not show any clear focus of infection in her head and was overall not significantly changed from prior.
Labs were notably primarily for a WBC of 11.9 (79%N), an LDH of 273 (no prior for comparison).
Her UA was relatively unremarkable and a CXR appeared to have no evidence of a PNA although it was somewhat nondiagnostic.
Neurosurgery felt that she should be admitted to medicine for workup of fever.
They feel it is very unlikely that the cause of her fever is her IC shunt given that she has had it for the better part of a year, however if her workup remains negative they could consider tapping it.
On the floor, she was tachycardic to 111, with a Tmax of 99.3 and BP of 133/69.
Autonomic dysfunction 20.
Does not respond to voice, sometimes withdraws from painful stimuli.
Unable to elicit reflexes in upper extremities, but right patellar reflex 2+, and 2-3 beats of clonus in Right foot.
