An EKG showed sinus tachycardia @ 119, NA/NI, 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**]-elevations in lead V2-6, 1-mm ST-elevations in leads aVL, I and inferior lead reciprocal changes.
In the cath [**Street Address(2) **] he was also diaphoretic with a blood glucose of 390 mg/dL.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (diagnosed at age 19 year-old - blood glucose runs in the 150-200 mg/dL range; takes Lantus and Humalog) 2.
CVS: PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line.
Clear to auscultation bilaterally without adventitious sounds.

[**2154-1-15**] CARDIAC CATH - French XBLAD3.5 guide provided good support.
Final angiography revealed normal flow to the apical LAD where there was TIMI 0 flow and filling via faint collaterals.
[**2154-1-15**] CXR - The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
This demonstrated significant thrombus in the proximal LAD with a RVD of 5.1 cm.
A distal overlapping 4.0 x 15 mm Integriti stent was deployed and postdilated to 5.0 mm.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the stent, no thrombus in the LAD up to the apex and no change in the apical LAD appearance.
Suggest warfarin INR [**3-1**].
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of three days ago, [**2154-1-16**], the findings are similar.
EKG consistent with anterolateral ST-elevations with cardiac catheterization showing abrupt cut-off at the mid-LAD with visible vessel thrombus of the mid-LAD and distal reconstitution with some distal-LAD disease; underwent aspiration and balloon dottering of LAD via RFA access but given the need to avoid distal embolization, anti-platelet therapy was planned for 48-hours with a re-look planned.
Received Aspirin 325 mg, Plavix 300 mg load, heparin IV 4000 unit bolus prior to cath [**Year (4 digits) **] transfer.
His re-look cardiac catheterization procedure was performed on [**2154-1-18**] and showed unchanged 60-80% sub-occlusive thrombus in the proximal LAD.
A distal overlapping 4.0 x 15 mm Integrity stent was deployed and post-dilated to 5.0 mm.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the stent, no thrombus in the LAD up to the apex and no change in the apical LAD appearance.
# DIASTOLIC HEART DYSFUNCTION - No historical evidence of systolic or diastolic dysfunction; no prior 2D-Echo reports and no physical evidence of heart failure noted.
His echocardiogram demonstrated no PFO or atrial septal defects and his left ventricular function was read as normal with no global systolic dysfunction (LVEF 55%).
A repeat 2D-Echo on [**1-19**] was unchanged.
He had no indication for diuresis and his weight was stable this admission.
Has been on insulin since and has blood glucose levels in the 150-200 mg/dL range at home, per patient.
At time of discharge, his blood glucose had improved control with use of 18U Lantus and 20U short-acting insulin prior to meals, resulting in blood glucoses of 150-170 mg/dL.
At the time of discharge, the following laboratory data, microbiologic data and radiologic studies were pending.
Will require cardiac MR imaging and follow-up echocardiography as an outpatient.
