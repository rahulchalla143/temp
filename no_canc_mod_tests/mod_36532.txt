CXR on admission: Chronic bronchiectatic changes of the right lung, unchanged in comparison to the prior [**Month/Day/Year **].
CXR on day following admission: Fluid levels within the cystic bronchiectasis foci of the right lung and new subtle left perihilar opacity.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed, EF 35-40%.
Left ventriculography revealed a calculated ejection fraction of 42% with anteroapical severe hypokinesis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a minimally elevated PCPW of 15mmHg.
The PA diastolic pressure was approximately 5mmHg higher than the mean PCPW consistent with mild elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).
Chest CT: 1) Increased bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis.
In addition, it was noted during bronchoscopy that patient had severe bronchomalacia, and that airways closed with minimal suction.
Of note, CT chest did reveal cystic bronchiectasis with air-fluid levels.
Finally, broncheoalveolar lavage fluid grew Mycobacterium fortuitum which had previously been identified in [**2143-10-14**] in the patient's sputum.
Coronary artery disease:  At the time of acute respiratory distress, patient complained of chest pain, and EKG and cardiac enzymes were evaluated, revealing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Patient underwent cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent placed in mid-left anterior descending coronary (initially 70% stenosis).
Her lisinopril and metoprolol should be titrated up as her blood pressure allows.
Her stool was tested for c diff and was negative x 5.
Diabetes: Pt's blood glucose was controlled with an insulin sliding scale.
While on propofol, her systolic blood pressure dropped into the 70s-80 but responded well to fluid boluses.
When pt became hypotensive off the propofol, it was determined that she had a component of septic shock and as her pneumonia and sinusitis were treated, her blood pressure improved to MAP of 60-65.
Pt has difficult BP readings on upper arm; better BP [**Location (un) 1131**] are obtained when cuff is placed on forearm.
Pt has a hx of guaic positive stools and she should have a GI work-up as an outpatient.
Check cuff pressure daily and keep <20cmH20; OK to have cuff leak.
