At echocardiogram so the patient was started on Oxacillin intravenous for empiric treatment of SBE.
Congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initially physical examination the patient had a temperature of 97.9, blood pressure 136/76, heart rate 76, respiratory rate 24 and oxygen saturation 95% on room air.
His heart rhythm was irregular.
He had 2+ dorsalis pedis and radial pulses bilaterally.
INITIAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 5.3, hematocrit 31.9, platelet count 222.
The differential demonstrates 60% neutrophils, 27% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 6.6% eosinophils and .4% basophils.
His PT was 11.7, PTT 31.6, INR 0.9.
Initial serum chemistries sodium 139, potassium 4.0, chloride 106, bicarb 16, BUN 60, creatinine 3.1, glucose 116.
ALT 28, AST 65, alkaline phosphatase 238, amylase 157, lipase 57, T bili 2.9.
Given his mildly elevated liver enzymes an abdominal ultrasound was performed in the Emergency Department.
This study demonstrated no intrahepatic ductal dilatation, no hydronephrosis, a cholestic structure of the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe, gallstones, a small amount of ascites and a small right sided pleural effusion.
Chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions and slight worsening congestive heart failure.
Urine eosinophils and a urine sodium were sent.
Given the recent increase in the patient's Furosemide dose from 20 to 40 the possibility of prerenal azotemia was considered and urine electrolytes were sent.
Although the rash was most likely secondary to Oxacillin induced AIN, given the associated acute renal failure and low grade fever the possibility of vasculitis was considered and serum ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] were sent.
Chest x-ray showed increased bibasilar haziness.
Arterial blood gas was performed, which showed 7.29/37/99 on 3 liters oxygen by nasal cannula.
He ruled out by cardiac enzymes during this time period as well.
On hospital day number three the patient's urinalysis showed eosinophils supporting a diagnosis of AIN.
Serum ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] tests were negative as well.
Urine electrolytes showed a sodium of 53, therefore the possibility of prerenal azotemia was felt to be less likely.
The night of hospital day number three the patient became tachypneic with respiratory at 38, oxygen saturation 86% on room air.
A chest x- ray again showed bilateral pulmonary edema with effusions, which increased a magnitude from a chest x-ray done earlier that afternoon.
Arterial blood gas showed 7.12/58/107/19.
The patient had no urine output to a total of 70 mg intravenous Lasix, and he was subsequently intubated for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
He was then transferred to the MICU where he became hypotensive and transiently required pressors to maintain his blood pressure.
Serum chemistries done on the morning after transfer to the MICU demonstrated an increase in anion gap metabolic acidosis.
He also showed worsening uremia with a BUN of 71 and a creatinine of 3.6.
His creatinine was up to four.
Serum creatinine increased to 4.8.
Given a hematocrit of 21.9 the patient was transfused 2 units with appropriate increase in hematocrit.
An echocardiogram demonstrated no change from the same study done in [**Month (only) **] of this year.
Blood cultures were drawn, which came back positive for yeast.
Urine sputum and fungal isolates were drawn on [**2193-6-29**], which came back negative at the time, but the patient had increasing thick oral secretions and therefore an ID consult was obtained.
On hospital day number ten sputum culture with gram stain showed gram positive cocci, which was speciated to staph aureus and the patient was continued on Vancomycin.
By hospital day number ten the patient's urine creatinine had begun to fall after three rounds of hemodialysis.
He was therefore started on a steroid taper and was hydrated with fluids to maintain blood pressure and renal perfusion.
On hospital day number fourteen the patient's serum creatinine had decreased to 2.3, although his BUN increased to 157 most likely secondary to his steroid taper.
In addition, surveillance blood cultures were drawn on this day.
These cultures eventually came back negative.
Electrocardiogram done at the time demonstrated no changes.
By hospital day number sixteen his BUN reached 159, although a creatinine was stable at 2.4.
Urine sediment demonstrated muddy brown casts and nondimorphic red blood cells consistent with ATN.
Before these plans were implemented, however, the patient's fractional excretion of sodium was calculated to be 0.4%.
Given this significant prerenal azotemia, which was attributed to a poor po intake versus congestive heart failure versus renal hyperperfusion versus catabolism versus glucocorticoid therapy, the patient was initiated on IVF with a goal of achieving adequate hydration to decrease his BUN and to clear his sensorium so he would again take adequate po fluids.
A 24 hour urine collection done demonstrated alarmingly low creatinine clearance of 14 and therefore his collection was repeated for confirmation.
On examination that day, however, the patient's mood was upbeat and he was offering to buy gifts for the staff.
The results of repeat 24 hour urine collection obtained on hospital day 26 again demonstrated a very low creatinine clearance of 12 and given this value as well as hisuremia and chronically poor po intake plans were therefore made to initiate hemodialysis.
He was initially scheduled to receive both a Perm-A-Cath and a PEG tube on hospital day 31, but the patient's family refused Perm-A-Cath placement, which was instead tentatively arranged to be done on an outpatient basis.
On hospital day number 34 the patient developed an elevated temperature of 99.6 axillary, which was an increase of 3 to 4 degrees above the patient's baseline.
Given this elevation, blood cultures, urine cultures and chest x-ray were obtained.
