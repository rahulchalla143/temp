MICROBIOLOGIC DATA: [**2196-1-10**] BAL bronchial fluid - negative AFB, negative culture, PCP negative, Legionella negative [**2196-1-16**] MRSA screen - negative .
IMAGING: [**2196-1-16**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Diffuse bilateral severe parenchymal opacities, similar to that seen previously in [**2195-11-19**] with multifocal pneumonia.
[**2196-1-16**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, predominantly of ground-glass pattern, with areas of more confluent consolidations.
Based on these findings, the pulmonary parenchymal abnormality is felt likely to reflect re-exposure an [**Doctor Last Name 360**] causing a reactive hypersensitivity pneumonitis or possibly an eosinophilic pneumonitis.
Bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy is unchanged when compared to the prior study and is likely reactive.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 52M with a PMH significant for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 30%-35%), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C infection, HTN, HLD, schizophrenia and depression who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory distress found to have bilaterally diffuse airspace opacities with ground-glass appearance on CT chest imaging with suspected component of CHF exacerbation, in the setting of recent illicit substance use.
A CT chest was obtained showing diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, predominantly of ground-glass pattern, with areas of more confluent consolidations.
No evidence of retinopathy, renal failure (baseline creatinine 0.9-1.1) or neuropathy.
# NON-ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY - Patient with known moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35%), LVD 6.4-cm, mild RV dilation, borderline function, 1+ MR on 2D-Echo from 12/[**2194**].
Admitted with some chest discomfort, EKG changes with non-specific ST changes and Troponin elevation to 0.05-0.06 with flat CK-MBs x 2.
BNP was 4924.
Diuresed -2.7L with [**Location 10226**]2L fluid balance prior to floor transfer.
His respiratory decompensation was attributed to a pulmonary source predominantly.
We continued his Lisinopril 10 mg PO daily, Metoprolol succinate XL 100 mg PO daily, maintained his home dose of Furosemide 40 mg PO daily and kept him on a fluid restriction of [**2183**] mL daily.
He was monitored with daily weights, monitored I/Os, and his goal for diuresis was 0.5-1L daily.
Liver synthetic function appears maintained (plt 424, albumin 2.8).
LFTs: AST 29 and ALT 13 with T-bili 0.4 this admission.
HIV negative, AMA and smooth negative in [**2190**].
Abdominal U/S in [**2189**] was normal.
