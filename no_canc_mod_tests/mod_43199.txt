L hip/pelvis XRay: There is an intramedullary rod in the left femur with a single proximal screw.
ECHO [**2102-6-12**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
CT HEAD done on [**2102-6-14**] for acute delirium There is no intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct.
CXR ([**2102-6-16**]): PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.
We held his diuretic, gave his blood transfusions and his blood pressures have been stable in the 90's systolic.
#CHF: ECHO revealed LVEF 50%  His lungs always sounded wet on auscultation.
His BP dropped after surgery due to aggressive diuresis and blood loss.
His lasix has been held, with no evidence of worsening CHF on chest x-ray ([**2102-6-16**]).
His rate was better controlled after starting the Amiodarone.
This also helped his blood pressure.
His rate has been well controlled on amiodarone and metoprolol.
His HCT was stable for more than a week prior to discharge.
His INR has been responding.
Will need to stop lovenox after INR between [**1-7**].
His INR needs to be monitored closely due to the interaction with Amiodarone.
