Although echocardiogram showed evidence of possible former rheumatic heart disease, the underlying cause of her valvular dysfunction is unclear.
All of the other review of systems were negative except as noted in HPI.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Exam limited by poor [**Last Name (Prefixes) 113**] windows.
Right ventricular free wall function is much improved, now low normal to normal.
Left ventricular function, which can only be assessed from the transgastric windows, appears normal with an ejection fraction of about 60%.
A perivalvular component can not be completely ruled out.
The maximum gradient across the valve is about 18 mm Hg with a mean pressure of 7 mm Hg in the setting of a cardiac output of 6 l/m.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 41yo woman with IDDM and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1291**] from [**2112**] admitted for cardiac cath in anticipation of MVR.
She was seen by nephrology for hyponatremia, and was fluid restricted and her doses of trileptal and celexa were reduced.
Cardiac cath on [**11-20**] showed no CAD, elevated right and left filling pressures and severe pulmonary hypertension.
She was transfused 1 unit for hct 27 and SBP 80s.
By post-operative day 10 her INR was therapeutic, but it rose quickly from the previous day and it was recommended that she stay overnight to ensure that her INR does not rise even further.
Her INR was scheduled to be checked by visiting nursing on the day after her discharge.
