He was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER where a right hip XR showed an impacted femoral neck fracture.
CXR showed subacute L rib fractures but no acute process.
Past Medical History: T2DM Diabetic nephropathy Parkinsons Dementia Anemia with unknown baseline hct 30, believed due to CKD CRI with reported baseline Cr 1.9, but none on file here Hyponatremia with reported baseline ~130 CHF HTN Depression BPH s/p TURP Irritable bowel syndrome h/o pancreatitis DJD Hiatal hernia Reflux esophagitis  Social History: Lives in [**Location 35689**] House.
Limited cross-table lateral views of the right hip are markedly limited and provides limited diagnostic detail.
[**2137-9-1**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/O Contrast No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
C diff: Negative .

Cystoscopy showed improved hemostatsis and bladder irrigation was stopped.
CT of abdomen/pelvis did not show retroperitoneal bleeding.
Hematocrit stable since [**2137-9-1**].
The patient was actively resusitated with fluids and blood with improvement in his blood pressures.
Blood pressures remained stable after that.
Given that the patient was clinically unstable from a blood pressure standpoint, he remained intubated.
Thrombocytopenia The patient was noted to have a dramatic platelet drop, concern for possible HIT, heparin was initially held and appropriate studies were ordered.
Platelet count increased slowly and remained stable after Hct stabilized.
After patient's hematocrit was stabilized, he was started on Lovenox for AC in the setting of recent ORIF of right hip.
HTN Initially pt's outpt lisinopril and catapres were held and a perioperative BB was given, but discontinued with hypotension.
EKG revealed evidence of atrial fibrillation without any acute ST changes.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn which did not indicate an ischemic etiology for his atrial fibrillation.
A TSH was checked which was normal.
The patient had a TTE which revealed mild left atrial enlargement and an EF greater than 60%.
The patient also had a V/Q scan to r/o PE given his recent hip fx and surgery which was negative.
