Pertinent Results: [**2140-12-11**] 08:01AM:  (Peak CK, MB) CK: 691  MB: 77  Trop-T: 0.86  [**2140-12-10**] 05:00PM CK 72  MB 8  Trop-T: 0.01  EKG ([**12-11**]):  NSR, normal axis.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**12-13**]): COMMENTS: 1.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated native three vessel CAD.
Selective arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent LIMA-LAD.
Selective venous conduit angiography revealed a totally occluded SVG-D1/OM1 graft at the proximal segment of ostial stent.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressures with a measured central aortic pressure of 106/64/79.
Chest CT ([**12-15**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
A 3-mm right lower lobe nodule; given the patient's history, a one-year followup CT is recommended to document stability.
CXR: [**2140-12-24**]: PA and lateral chest compared to [**12-21**] through 29: The already improved post-operative widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax  [**2140-12-25**] WBC-12.6* RBC-3.63* Hgb-10.9* Hct-32.4* MCV-89 MCH-30.0 MCHC-33.6 RDW-13.5 Plt Ct-408 [**2140-12-24**] WBC-13.7* RBC-3.58* Hgb-10.9* Hct-31.4* MCV-88 MCH-30.4 MCHC-34.7 RDW-13.6 Plt Ct-379# [**2140-12-10**] WBC-11.6*# RBC-4.55* Hgb-13.5* Hct-40.2 MCV-88 MCH-29.7 MCHC-33.6 RDW-12.9 Plt Ct-205  [**2140-12-25**] Glucose-147* UreaN-27* Creat-1.2 Na-138 K-3.5 Cl-94* HCO3-35* [**2140-12-24**] Na-138 K-4.2 Cl-97 [**2140-12-24**] UreaN-23* Creat-1.1 Na-138 K-3.4 Cl-95* HCO3-32 [**2140-12-23**] Glucose-158* UreaN-19 Creat-1.2 Na-138 K-2.9* Cl-97 HCO3-32 [**2140-12-10**] Glucose-204* UreaN-16 Creat-1.1 Na-138 K-3.9 Cl-102 HCO3-25  Micro: [**2140-12-24**] URINE FINAL REPORT [**2140-12-25**]  URINE CULTURE (Final [**2140-12-25**]): YEAST.
Initial set of CE's were negative but subsequent up-trended with CK peak 691 and MB peak 77.
Cardiac catheterization [**12-13**] showed completely occluded SVG-D1/OM, 90% stenosis of SVG-PDA, known 90% LAD stenosis just distal to touchdown.
Vitals were stable but EKG showed new ST depressions in two leads, CE's negative.
Plt dropped from 150->10 in 24 hrs.
HIT Antibody was also sent which was negative.
His hct has down-trended and he received a total of 1 unit PRBC on [**12-16**].
Repeat UA today in setting of culture showing "probable" enterococcus previously in the setting of significant blood in urine and improved urine currently.
Repeat UA and UCx sent after bleeding hematuria improved.
POD#1 he transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
