ECG [**2185-4-17**]:Sinus tachycardia.
CXR [**2185-4-19**]: 1) Slight improvement in left lower lobe opacity, likely improving pneumonia.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2185-4-25**] 2:46 PM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST  Reason: Evaluate for PE Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old man with COPD, resolving pneumonia, continues to have persistent tachycardia and hypoxia REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Evaluate for PE CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
COMPARISON: Chest x-ray of [**2185-4-24**].
TECHNIQUE: CT angiogram of the chest before and after the administration of Optiray nonionic contrast due to fast bolus technique.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST: There is no sign of filling defect within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Follow up chest CT in 6 weeks after treatment is recommended to ensure that these changes resolve.
In the ED he was found febrile to 103.1 and tachycardiac.
His WBC count was 11.2, with 80% neutrophils and 6 bands.
A CXR revealed a LLL opacity.
Two sets of enzymes were negative, and his ECG changes were attributed to demand phenomenon in the setting of hypoxia and tachycardia.
Repeat chest xray revealed LLL opacity, pleural effusions and signs of pulmonary edema and left heart failure.
Patient denied orthopnea, did not have lower extremity edema, and follow-up chest x-rays continued to show improvement, as the patient auto-diuresed.
Given his slow improvement and low oxygen sats there was some concern for a PE and a CTA was obtained.In addition, patient received fluids in the MICU, and chest x-ray at that time was consistent with heart failure, however patient diuresed well on his own with improvement.
Patient will likely need a repeat CT in [**6-15**] weeks to look for resolution of changes associated with pneumonia.
His prednisone was increased back to 40 mg qd given his persistent hypoxemia and will need a slow taper.
He had minimally elevated troponin-t (0.02) with a CK of 279 and 221 on two separate values when first admitted that subsequently trended down to <0.01 (with normal CK's), where they remained.
)Anemia -- His hematocrit remained low but stable throughout the admission.
Iron studies were checked that demonstrated an anemia of chronic disease.
His hct remained stable.
You will likely need a repeat chest CT in [**6-15**] weeks  Patient is being tranfered to VA for further evaluation    Completed by:[**2185-4-26**
