Following TPA, she had mild improvement of motor exam, which is as follows upon transfer to ICU: slight dysarthria, sleepiness, not saying more than several words at a time, no blink to threat on left, forced right gaze preference (starting to improve towards midline better), normal brainstem reflexes, left facial droop, low tone on left, left delt minimally antigravity, 4- at [**Hospital1 **], 3 at triceps, left IP antigravity x 3-4 seconds before dropping (better than admission) and UMN weakness, brisk reflexes on the left, upgoing toe on the left, subjective sensory loss on left.
Repeat cta following administration of IV tpa showed no recannulization of the MCA, but also no bleed.
I saw the patient at 2:30PM prior to intubation, and her exam is listed below.

SUBSEQUENT CTA BRAIN:  CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of the normally midline structures.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK: Bilateral vertebral and carotid arteries are patent within the neck.
POST-TPA CT BRAIN:  FINDINGS: Comparison is made with CT cerebral angiogram performed earlier on the same day ([**12-21**]).
No CT features of hemorrhagic transformation are seen at present.
The CT angiographic images demonstrate persistent occlusion of the proximal segment of the right middle cerebral artery (series 3, image 147).
The overall appearance is unchanged since the prior study of [**12-21**], with [**2192-4-9**].
Evolving cerebral infarct confined to the territory of the right middle cerebral artery, with no CT evidence of hemorrhagic transformation at present.
CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAPHY WITH BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY [**4-12**]: CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM:  CLINICAL INFORMATION: Acute onset of left hemiparesis.
A balloon angioplasty was performed at the occluded proximal segment of the right middle cerebral artery with an hyperglide balloon catheter.

[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  ***** MRI EXAM OF THE CERVICAL SPINE [**4-12**] (performed to help clear c-spine) MRI exam of the cervical spine was obtained according to standard departmental protocol.
Unfortunately, the exam was degraded by motion artifact.
The overall cervical spine MRI exam was degraded by repeated motion artifact.
POST-ANGIO HEAD CT [**4-9**]: FINDINGS: Comparison with the prior study of [**2192-4-10**] shows no significant interval change.
CXR [**4-13**] (prior CXR's done to confirm line and tube placement): PORTABLE AP CHEST: The tip of the left subclavian catheter is in the SVC.
CT BRAIN [**4-10**]: There is increased low density in the posterior frontal lobe on the right and in the caudate nucleus and basal ganglia.
CT BRAIN [**4-11**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN FINDINGS: Comparison with the prior study of [**2192-4-10**] shows no significant interval change.
CT BRAIN [**4-12**]: There is no significant interval change compared to one day previous.
Moderate mucosal thickening within ethmoid air cells and small fluid levels in the sphenoid air cells are unchanged.
CT BRAIN [**4-13**]: FINDINGS: Hypodensity in the distribution of the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery is again seen with internal areas of isodensity that are unchanged.
Mass effect with compression of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle with right to left shift does not appear significantly changed compared to the exam of one day prior.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to the exam of one day prior.
CHEST XRAY [**4-16**]: AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There has been interval extubation.
TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHO [**4-10**] with BUBBLE STUDY: Findings: Sedation was achieved with propofol continuous IV infusion throughout the course of the procedure.
No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Contrast study was performed with 2 iv injections of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline, at rest, and post-Valsalva.
Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
The interatrial septum is dynamic, but no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
* * * [**4-17**] MRI BRAIN FINDINGS:  As noted on the prior CTs, there is a subacute infarct of the right middle cerebral artery territory, specifically the superior division, with acute components.
[**4-19**] CT TORSO IMPRESSION: 1.
She was admitted to the neuro ICU for close monitoring of exam, blood pressure, vital signs.
She underwent daily CT scans for days due to the presence of edema and midline shift; neurosurgery was consulted for the possibility of hemicraniectomy to relieve swelling, but she did not need this procedure.
Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants were held for the first 48 hours following the TPA administration, then aspirin therapy was initiated.
Coagulopathy workup was sent from the ED after TPA had been given (though many hours between TPA and labs) - heme onc was consulted for ?which labs to repeat.
On [**4-14**] she was extubated and her exam improved.
Her exam at transfer was significant for soft voice but fluent language, weakness of the left arm and left facial droop, with right gaze preference though improved movement of the eyes past the midline on extraocular muscle assessment.
Workup for potential causes of stroke were pursued, including CT of torso to rule out malignancy (negative).
The following tests were sent: [**4-10**]  Lupus Anticoagulant NEG      Antithrombin III 66 % 62 - 108      Protein C, Functional 91 % 67 - 123      Protein S, Functional 61 % 51 - 133      Anticardiolipin Antibody IgG 3.6 GPL 0 - 15      Anticardiolipin Antibody IgM 7.3 MPL 0 - 12.5      Homocysteine 4.2      Factor VIII 120      Factor IX 100 [**4-14**] Thrombin 27.3 (mildly elevated)      Lupus anticoagulant negative [**4-17**] ESR 49 (in the setting of resolving pneumonia) [**4-19**] Factor VIII, AT III, Protein C and S profiles, Factor V [**Location (un) 5244**], Ro and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] -     [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] pending      [**Doctor First Name **] negative, ANCA negative Some hematologic tests were re-sent since the first set were drawn shortly after TPA was given.
Most of these repeat labs from [**4-19**] are still pending.
