In [**2101-10-7**], she had a workup done which revealed a patent foramen ovale.
The echocardiogram also showed an ejection fraction of greater than 60 percent with a right to left shunt consistent with a patent foramen ovale/atrial septal defect.
Her head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was within normal limits.
Her abdominal examination was benign.
She had no obvious varicosities and her neurologic examination showed she was grossly intact.
She had two plus bilateral femoral, dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial and radial pulses and no carotid bruits.
