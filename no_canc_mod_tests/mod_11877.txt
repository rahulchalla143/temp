# s/p cardiac arrest - PEA primary rhythm, thought to be secondary to hypoxia from mucous plugging or blood clots in trachea.
He had no signs of sepsis and blood cultures were all negative.
# Seizure/anoxic brain injury/stroke - Most likely [**1-13**] anoxic brain injury in setting of cardiac arrest and hypoperfusion to brain as well as later repeat MRI brain on [**5-10**] showed a new right posterior temporal/superior parietal/occipital regions, posterior to the chronic infarct, which was the culprit for seizure/twitching.
His twitching improved with dilantin but still continued to have intermittent eye twitching.
Pt was switched to po dilantin on [**5-16**] and repeat dilantin level after 2 days of po dilantin was 12.4.
Sputum was also growing MRSA and started vancomycin on [**2141-5-6**], last day at least [**2141-5-28**].
Repeat CXR after #2 removed showed no changes in hemopneumothorax.
The right sided chest tube was placed to water seal on [**2141-5-22**] with a chest xray that showed a stable pneumothorax and no significant change or worsening with re-expansion of the right lung.
# h/o CHF - EF 15%, was on afterload agents including BB, Isordil, digoxin, hydralazine.
- His hematocrit remained low at 24 but stable with no active issues.
He had no more recurrence of diarrhea and negative C. Diff cultures from [**2141-5-10**].
# F/E/N - with G tube on tube feeds, monitor lytes .
