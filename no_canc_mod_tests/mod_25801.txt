CT from OSH suggests a connection between sinus and brain.
- will treat broadly with vanco, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and flagyl at meningitic doses, renally dosed - follow CSF cx data from [**Hospital1 **] - pan culture if spikes - consult ID tonight re: managment, antibiotic choices - ENT called from [**Location **] to consult re: need for evaluation of CSF leak.
- check CXR for infiltrates, TB nodules - swab throat for strep, culture - tylenol for fever, pain - airborne precautions - q 2 hr neuro checks, watch for complications of meningitis including stroke,venous thrombosis, abscess/empyema, change in neurologic exam, seizures, further decline in mental status.
Chordoma - will check MRI brain for further characterization of anatomy, is there more/new tumor?
- IVF for now with q 12 hr na checks  4.
[**Name (NI) **] wife brought him to [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] this AM after his son-n-law, a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] concerned re: his health.
Workup was done at [**Hospital1 **] that included temp 104 degrees F, WBC  21K, LP consistent with bacterial meningitis (was given 2 grams CTX, 1 gram vanco, and here given 1 gram ampicillin and 500mg flagyl) and CT head that suggests a communication of the brain with the sphenoid sinus.
Most recent MRI [**2-16**] (per report wife gives us, copy is in chart) shows no signif change, no new lesion.

TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast CT scans through the paranasal sinuses were obtained and coronal and sagittal reformatted images are provided.
Comparison is made to the CT scan of [**2160-8-9**].
FINDINGS:  As noted on the CT of the brain, there is a marked amount of intracranial air, which is distributed in the subarachnoid space.
There are no previous studies of the abnormality available for comparison.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old man with REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: csf fisulta w/ meningitis - 2 leaks CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images of the orbits and sella are obtained without the administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
COMPARISON: Head CT dated [**2160-8-13**].
The evaluation of the brain parenchyma is limited in this thin-section bone algorithm images.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 y/o male was admitted w/ symtoms of fever, neck stiffness/pain, decreased ambulation and mental status, n/v and decreased appetite.
Serial imaging demostrated that the destructive process affecting the skull base was stable and that it is difficult to distinguish recurrent from residual chordoma versus postoperative changes.
Patient continued to have CSF nasal drainge and temperature spike through POD#7.
CSF leakeage stoppped for a few days, and then returned in small drips upon activity.
Pan cultures were negative [**Hospital 63960**] hospital course.
Patient was kept on strict bed rest for days with the lumbar drain at 10cc/hour for five days.
WBC, lytes, CXR, ECG, Thyroid tests were all normal.
Work-up was done and final recommendations were just to increase lopressor dose and follow-up as an outpatient.
