A CXR showed bilateral infiltrates.
EKG showed ST depression in lateral leads.
He received a chest CTA which showed prominent mucous plugging, complete blockage of R mainstem, collapse of RLL.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior and posterior wall hypokinesis.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-7-6**], mild aortic stenosis, moderate left ventricular contractile dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and significant right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis are now present.

A BAL was done and a large mucus plug was suctioned.
CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia, so he was run 3 L negative on dialysis with improvement in his vent settings.
EF was 35%.

ACEI was deferred due to persistently low blood pressures  # Respiratory Failure: Extubated [**2146-6-3**].
Chest PT and acapella were done during the patient's floor stay for chronic bronchiectasis and should be continued on an outpatient basis.
Pending BAL studies will need to be follow-up upon discharge.
# Leukocytosis: The patient was noted to have a white count on day of discharge of 11.7.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Check CBC with next lab check at hemodialysis to ensure that white count has resolved.
