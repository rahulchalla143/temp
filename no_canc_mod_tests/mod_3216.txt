The patient underwent an echocardiogram shortly after admission which demonstrated marked LV anterior wall hypokinesis, and his serum troponin rose to a highest level of approximately 4.
He spiked a fever within 24 hours of admission and cultures were sent.
His urine culture grew enterococcus, and he was started on vancomcin.
His creatinine continued to rise despite IVF resuscitation, and he was administered tube feeds which were advanced toward goal.
His urine output picked up and his creatinine decreased over time.
- Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], off home sotalol and atenolol per electrophysiology service - Echo with overall left ventricular systolic function moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %).
Repeat echo [**5-6**] unchanged - Pt has DDDR pacemaker, underlying rhythm is CHB, PM set for AV sequential pacing unless atrial rate > 150.
- his hematocrit at the time of discharge is 24, but we have intentionally held off on transfusion given his hemodynamic stability; would transfuse for hematocrit less than 21 (given TRICC and CRIT data)  PULM: Sternal fx, R [**4-10**] and L [**2-8**] rib fx-bilateral flail, - Ciprofloxacin until [**5-17**] - Perc Trachestomy in situ  GI: Tube feeds/PO diet - TF via PEG - Nectar thick liquids and soft solids started [**5-14**]  RENAL: Acute on CRF, now improved to 1.2.
- monitor hct, no evidence of persistent bleeding - Coumadin restarted, need to follow INR - D/C SC heparin when INR therepeutic - continue ASA 81 mg QD  ENDO: DMII.
- restarted oral hypoglycemics [**5-12**] - NPH 20U [**Hospital1 **], can titrate up as needed  MSK: Right minimally displaced fracture of the coronoid process of the ulna.
