URINE CULTURE (Final [**2126-3-2**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.
EKG [**2-25**]:  Sinus tachycardia and occasional ventricular ectopy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2125-7-24**] there are now more prominent Q waves suggesting interim inferior myocardial infarction.
Both atrial and ventricular ectopy have appeared, the rate has increased and there is more prominent downsloping ST segment depression in leads V5-V6.
Catheterization [**2-25**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Abdominal aortic angiography demonstrated moderate distal disease with a small infrarenal saccular aneurysm.
Nonselective angiography of the bilateral, single renal arteries demonstrated 40% proximal disease bilaterally.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, a small proximal perforation, a distal perforation treated with prolonged balloon inflation and protamine, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Final angigoraphy demonstrated a 30% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Arterial Duplex [**2-27**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of left leg pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.
Catheterization [**2-27**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Initial angiography was obtained by access of the right CFA to the contralateral left SFA using a 6 French sheath.
Final angiography demonstrated a 10% residual stenosis in the PFA, no residual stenosis, in the SFA, no residual stenosis in the EIA, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow.
A perforation was noted which was treated with multiple 5 minute balloon inflations, administration of protamine, and finally placement of an 8.0 x 30 mm WallGraft covered stent postdilated with an 8.0 mm SDS balloon.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, a small persistent perforation, and normal flow.
Perforation of the right CIA treated with protamine, blood pressure control, prolonged balloon inflations, and a covered stent.
EKG [**2-27**]:  Sinus rhythm with first degree A-V delay.
Since previous tracing of [**2126-2-26**], first degree A-V delay present and ST-T wave changes decreased.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2-27**] 8 p.m.:  IMPRESSION: Retroperitoneal hemorrhage worse on the left, consistent with the history of iliac artery perforation, although the exact origin of this hemorrhage is not identified on this CT.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2-28**] 3 a.m.:  IMPRESSION: Interval increase in the amount of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
EKG [**2-28**]:  Sinus rhythm.
CXR [**3-1**]:  Focal opacity in left retrocardiac region.
Followup films would also be helpful to document resolution and to fully exclude a neoplasm in this region.
Final angiography demonstrated 30% residual PFA stenosis, no residual stenosis of the L SFA, a small proximal perforation of the L SFA, a distal perforation treated with prolonged balloon inflation and protamine, and normal flow.
She underwent another planned catheterization 2 days after admission, for planned further intervention of her severe bilateral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease.
This catheterization demonstrated L SFA 70% stenosis, L PFA 70% stenosis, L external iliac artery 90% stenosis, L common iliac artery 90% stenosis, R common iliac artery 70% stenosis.
Final angiography demonstrated a 10% residual stenosis of the L PFA, no residual stenosis in the SFA, no residual stenosis in the EIA, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow.
Post-stenting of the R common iliac artery there was extravasation of contrast which persisted despite balloon pressure and protamine.
The patient was placed on nitroprusside drip for elevated blood pressure to 198/60 and sent to the CCU.
2) Retroperitoneal hemorrhage:  After her second catheterization with perforation of the R CIA, she underwent CT of the abdomen/pelvis to evaluate the extent of the bleed.
She was noted to have hypoactive bowel sounds and a rigid tender abdomen, and was therefore sent for a repeat stat CT of the abdomen/pelvis which showed interval increase in the amount of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, however the amount of increase over the 8 hours since the previous CT scan was not considered excessive, and the patient was hemodynamically stable throughout, therefore it was decided to manage conservatively with PRBC transfusion and clinical/laboratory observation.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable, and her hematocrit remained stable status post 4 units of PRBCs over 24 hours.
Her abdominal exam was benign at the time of discharge.
4) Complete heart block:  1 day after her second catheterization she was noted to have a 6 second period of complete heart block during which time she had an atrial rate of approximately 75 beats per minute.
She was also noted to have persistent nephrograms on CT scan (performed for her RP bleed, as above), which raised concern for contrast induced nephropathy.
Her creatinine peaked at 1.4 and came down to 1.2 on the day of discharge, however, and the patient was producing adequate urine output.
6) HTN:  The patient was on a nipride drip for 24 hours post catheterization, for blood pressure goal of 100-140.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.
A CXR revealed a retrocardiac opacity which had been seen on previous CXRs.
She should have a repeat CXR at some point to assess for interval change in this opacity.
