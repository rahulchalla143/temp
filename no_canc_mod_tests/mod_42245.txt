On arrival of Emergency Medical Service arrival, he was found to be hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/60.
The patient was also found to be bradycardic with a rate of 45.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was afebrile, his pulse was 80 (which was paced), his blood pressure was 40 to 113/19 to 70, and he was on 100 percent FiO2 and intubated with a respiratory rate of 12, tidal volume was 600, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
The rest of his examination was not pertinent.
LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial laboratory data revealed his white blood cell count was 17.1, his hematocrit was 36.7, and his platelets were 243.
Chemistry-7 revealed his sodium was 138, potassium was 5.8, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 31, creatinine was 1.3, and his blood glucose was 234.
A creatine kinase was obtained which was 86.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed a likely high junctional escape rhythm at 40 with sinus node activity.
QRS of 118, and no ST-T wave changes.
A chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and endotracheal tube in good position.
Of note,  the patient had a recent echocardiogram in [**2106-10-4**] which showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent to 60 percent and symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, a severe resting outflow tract obstruction of the left ventricle, as well as 3 plus mitral regurgitation, 1 plus tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Given the high white blood cell count and hypotension, there was also some concern for sepsis.
The patient had an infections workup which included blood and urine cultures which were all negative.
Furthermore, he had a set of cardiac enzymes which were obtained which were negative.
The patient also had a subsequent echocardiogram done while in house which showed severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of 60 percent, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Eventually, the patient's blood pressure began to recover as the nodal agents worked off and his pacemaker was functioning.
He was initially started on a labetalol drip as well as hydralazine for blood pressure control.
Therefore, he was started on metoprolol and verapamil for blood pressure control and heart rate control.
and was then switched from metoprolol to labetalol for further blood pressure control; however, the patient stated that he felt extremely dizzy, and the team attributed this to his beta blocker dose.
Therefore, he was continued on just verapamil 40 mg by mouth q.8h., and his blood pressures subsequently returned to [**Location 213**].
As mentioned previously, none of the numerous blood cultures that were obtained were revealing for any type of infection.
