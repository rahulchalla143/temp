Trazodone 12.5 mg/37.5 mg. 11.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, temperature 98.6 F.; blood pressure 140/60; pulse 73, respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation 99% on room air.
Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally with scattered crackles which clear with cough.
LABORATORY:  Notable labs upon admission are white blood cell count of 10,000, hematocrit of 30.8 down from baseline of 38, platelets 337,000.
ALT 20, AST 25, LDH 249, alkaline phosphatase of 161.
Potassium of 6.4 and upon repeat 5.7.
EKG is sinus at 75 beats per minute, intervals with PR interval at 220; otherwise intervals within normal limits; [**Street Address(2) 12255**] depressions in V3, but no acute ST-T wave changes.
On the morning of [**12-19**], her hematocrit was 27.0, down from 30 the evening before.
An upper endoscopy was performed and a 1 cm antral ulcer was identified without any active bleeding which was felt to the be the source of the patient's bleeding (upper endoscopy was performed as the patient's BUN was elevated and it was felt that an upper source of bleeding may be possible).
The patient received two more units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit remained stable at 27 to 28.
The patient's converted to atrial fibrillation and her blood pressures began to drop into the 90s and she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.
A tagged red blood cell scan did not demonstrate any active bleeding on the evening of [**12-20**].
A colonoscopy the next day was non-diagnostic as the patient still had significant amounts of stool in her colon.
The patient received two more units of red blood cells and the output of bright red blood per rectum began to decrease.
On the morning of [**12-21**], the patient had a repeat colonoscopy which demonstrated multiple diverticula throughout the course of the colon, but did not show signs of any active bleeding.
On the afternoon of [**12-21**], the patient was transferred back to the Medical Floor where she remained until discharge with a blood pressure stable in the 120s to 140s systolic over 60s to 70s diastolic, a heart rate which was variable between normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation in the 120s to 130s, and with no further episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
Upon discharge, the patient was having good oxygen saturation on room air.
