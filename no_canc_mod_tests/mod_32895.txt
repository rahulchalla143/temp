She was taken to an outside hospital ([**Hospital3 **]) where noncontrast head CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No source of bleeding was identified on CTA of the head performed earlier in the same day.
CORRELATION: CTA of the head performed [**2153-3-19**].
The discussed risks included stroke, loss of vision and/or speech which may be temporary or permanent, injury to blood vessels, and possible treatment with stents and coils if needed.
A preprocedure timeout was performed using two patient identifiers.
The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were performed from the following locations: Right vertebral artery, right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, left vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left external carotid artery, and left internal carotid artery.
Hemostasis was obtained using an Angio-Seal device.
LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: Cervical, petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid segments of the internal carotid artery are normal.
RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY: Selective arteriogram of the right femoral artery demonstrates patency.
Please note that the anterior communicating artery is not visualized, likely representing hypoplasia as correlated with the CT angiogram of the head performed earlier in the same day.

TECHNIQUE: CTA of the head was performed including 5 mm non-contrast axial images of the head followed by 1.25 mm axial images after the administration of 80 cc of Optiray IV contrast.
Multiplanar MIP and volume-rendered reconstructions were obtained.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

A preprocedure time-out was performed using two patient identifiers.
The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were performed from the following locations.
Comparison cerebral arteriogram performed on [**2153-3-19**].
She was taken to an outside hospital ([**Hospital3 **]) where noncontrast head CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage.
She was brought to the angio suite and an angiogram was performed.
They were stable, she did however have mild vasospasm on the [**2153-3-26**] angio which was not treated as her clinical exam remained stable.
Blood and urine cultures are still pending at the time of this discharge.
