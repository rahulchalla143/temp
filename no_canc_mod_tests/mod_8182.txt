BP 120, 80% RA in the field.
ON arrival to the [**Name (NI) **] pt was minimally responsive, GCS of [**4-15**].
FS on arrival 64, improved to 92 after glucose administration.
Initial vs were: T 97.9 P 95 BP 84/60 R [**4-20**] O2 sat 92 4L.
Pt BP remained in 80s to 90s, HR in 90s, EKG was normal.
CT head was negative.
Eye pH was 7, no foreign objects noted in his eyes.
After the CT scan an LP was performed given his MS changes.

CXR [**5-17**]: FINDINGS: Heart size and pulmonary vascularity remain normal.
CT head [**5-17**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction.
ECHO [**5-20**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).

Imaging Final CXR [**5-18**]:  FINDINGS: The study is somewhat limited as the right costophrenic angle has not been included.
Inital VBG with CO2 of 90 also suggests hypercarbia as a cause, perhaps as a results of hypoventilation from the opiods.
LP performed in ED without evidence of infection and CSF cultures negative to date.
TTE revealed normal function with small pericardial effusion.
Blood, urine cultures are negative.
# Polysubstance abuse/Opiod overdose - On further questioning, pt denied suicidal ideations, but later stated that he didn't remember if he did it as a suicide attempt.
His oxygenation improved over the course of the hospitalization.
# Demand ischemia: On admssion, EKG without evidence of acute ST-T wave changes.
Initial troponin was 0.08 and rose to 0.1.
ECHO revealed normal function with small pericardial effusion.
