She remained stable on nasal cannula O2 13-50 cc of oxygen until [**2151-7-22**] with a marked increase in her O2 needs from 50 cc to 1 liter of O2 due to increased desaturations requiring blow-by O2.

An echocardiogram was obtained on [**7-23**] revealing pulmonary hypertension, a dilated right ventricle, and poor right ventricular function.
With the echocardiogram finding, cardiology recommended intubation and sedation, and restarting the dopamine at 5 mcg/kg.
She remained on dopamine, and her follow-up echocardiogram on [**7-26**] showed improvement in her ventricular function and recommendations at that time were to extubate.

Right ventricular pressure is estimated by the tricuspid regurg jet velocity to be about 85 mmHg.
Her most recent set of electrolytes are from [**2151-7-31**] - sodium 136, potassium 3.4, chloride 96, total CO2 28, SGOT 27, SGPT 13.

Her most recent bilirubin was on [**2151-7-31**] - total bili 2, direct bili 1.2, GGT 123.
HEMATOLOGY: Hematocrit on admission was 49.
Her most recent hematocrit is on [**7-21**] of 45.
She recently received PRBC for a Hct of 25.
Transfusion was completed at 9am on [**2151-8-2**].
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: CBC and blood culture were obtained on admission.
CBC was benign.
Blood cultures remained negative at 48 hours, at which time she was discontinued from her ampicillin and gentamicin.
On [**2151-7-21**], with increased respiratory needs, a CBC and blood culture were obtained.
CBC was benign, and blood culture was negative.
Blood cultures remain negative.
Her most recent levels had a peak of 27.4 and a trough of 8.1, and that was on [**2151-7-28**].
