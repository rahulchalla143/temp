When he returned home his wife encouraged him to go to the doctor and had a friend who is a nurse check his blood pressure which was found to be 160/90.
EKG showed sinus with rate of 73, ST elevation in II, III, aVF with TWI in V5,V6.
Cardiac enzymes initially trop 0.3, CK 116, then on 2nd set troponin 5.43, CK 440.
At that time he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope.
-Tobacco history: Smokes [**2-22**] PPD x 50 years, Quit approx 10 years ago.

Sucessful thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of a thrombotic occlusion at the mid RCA with two overlapping DESs.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
He had evidence of an inferior STEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have complete occlusion of the mid RCA treated with 2 overlapping DES.
His CK peaked at 995 post catheterization.
His post PCA echocardiogram showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
The remaining segments contract normally and his LVEF = 50 %.
He was also treated with atorvastatin 80mg which can be changed back to his home dose of 40mg on discharge as his lipid panel shows very good control.
His verapamil was discontinued and he was changed to metoprolol and lisinopril which were titrated for blood pressure control prior to discharge.
This was held during this admission and on discharge in order to maximize room for metoprolol and lisinopril titration as his blood pressure was marginal.
