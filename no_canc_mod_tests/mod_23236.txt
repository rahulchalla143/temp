At the OSH she underwent a CT which showed new LLL consolidation vs. mass.
For concern for epidural abscess, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further work-up and evaluation.
On arrival to the ED here her vitals were 74/42 HR 109 RR 18 and sat of 97% on 4L NC.

[**2159-11-17**]   Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT) IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-16**] and 3: The frontal chest radiographs over the past 36 hours have suggested the development of a generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality, but today's lateral view shows that the lower lobes are largely spared, and that the process has a great deal of coalescence in the right middle lobe.
It also shows that the mass-like consolidation first seen on the chest CT, [**11-15**] be shrinking.
Findings were discussed over the telephone with the intern caring for this patient  [**2159-11-15**]   Radiology CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
These findings are of uncertain chronicity and comparison with prior studies would be helpful.
Brief Hospital Course: Pneumococcal PNA: Met SIRS criteria at admission given fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, plus presumption of infection based on CT scan abnormality.
Bronchoscopy done in the MICU showed purulent secretions, gram stain negative, and culture negative.
CXR [**11-17**] showed worsening b/l infiltrates.
CT chest [**11-18**] revealed evolution of pleural effisions and tiny pericardial effusion and b/l mixed ground-glass opacities.
Pulmonology was consulted and felt that her consolidations found on repeat CT imaging were likely due to anaphylactic response to Gad rather than worsening PNA d/t lack of symtpoms.
Given her history of lung adenocarcinoma, she will need follow up chest imaging in [**5-21**] weeks to ensure resolution of her pneumonia.
Her Hct continued to be stable during her admission.
Airway pressures suggested no significant airway resistance, implying that steroids and epinephrine helped reduce the bronchospasm.
A repeat Chest CT on [**11-18**] revealed worsening of consolidations, but per the preliminary pulmonary consult, these findings were felt to be secondary to her anaphylaxis to gadolinium rather than worsening of her pneumonia.
They recommended follow up CT in [**2-16**] weeks, which has been arranged.
Septic shock 2.
You will need to have your CT scans followed closely in the future by your primary care physician and oncologist.
A follow-up CT scan should be done.
