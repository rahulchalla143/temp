[**12-4**] CT Head: Stable appearance of right-sided subdural collection post removal of subdural drainage catheter.
[**12-6**] CT Head: Stable appearance of right subdural hematoma with slight improvement in the degree of mass effect and midline shift.
[**12-11**] CT Head: 1.
[**12-15**] CT Head: Stable appearance compared to previous examination.
[**12-20**] CT Head: Stable appearance of the brain from [**2191-12-15**], with residual small right subdural hematoma and mild mass effect.
MICROBIOLOGY: [**12-5**] Blood Cx: negative [**12-6**] Urine Cx: negative [**12-7**] Urine Cx: negative  NEUROLOGY: [**12-13**] EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of delta frequency slowing seen over the right anterior quadrant.
In addition, there is an attenuation of the background rhythm over the right fronto-temporal region which suggests an increased recording distance between the surface electrodes and brain surface as can be seen with extra-axial fluid such as blood or scalp edema.
Postop day one patient had repeat Head Ct which was improved with less mass effect and less shift from scan done on [**12-3**].
On [**11-27**] patient had evidence of CHF on cxr and was treated with lasix.
Patient had bedside swallow evaluation done on [**2191-12-12**].
Patient had EEg which was negative for seizure activity and had her blood pressure was kept in the 140 range.
Head Ct on [**12-15**] showed some residural subdural hematoma.
Patient was started back on her coumadin on [**12-15**] with goal INR 2.0-2.5 currently on 5mg per day.
