The patient was then given a digoxin load, but no beta blocker given the severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on his pulmonary function tests; which revealed FEV1 of 0.5 (which is 29% of predicted), FVC of 1.05 (which is 45% of predicted), and FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES AT THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL: Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 7.6, hematocrit was 41.2, mean cell volume was 103, and platelets were 289.
Sodium was 143, potassium was 4.8, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 42.4, blood urea nitrogen was 27, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 105.
Calcium was 9.1.
INR was 1.1.
Creatine kinases were 57 and 97.
The creatine kinase of 97 had a CK/MB of 3.56 and a CK/MB index of 3.7.
Troponin was 0.2.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusion.
Echocardiogram at the outside hospital showed mild left atrial enlargement, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and ejection fraction of 55% to 60%, severe aortic stenosis, with a peak gradient of 114 mmHg, a mean gradient of 55 mmHg, an area of 0.7 cm2, trace aortic regurgitation, trace mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary aortic systolic hypertension (PASD of 40 mmHg plus RAP).
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES AT [**Hospital1 **]: Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 7.5 (with 76.8% neutrophils and 14.3% lymphocytes and 6.8% monocytes), hematocrit was 40.6, and platelets were 198.
Sodium was 140, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 35, blood urea nitrogen was 36, creatinine was 0.8, and blood glucose was 104.
ALT was 14 and AST was 17.
INR was 1.1 and partial thromboplastin time was 70.6.
Magnesium was 1.9.
AORTIC STENOSIS:  A repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, moderate left atrial enlargement, moderate right atrial enlargement, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve are was 0.7 cm2, peak gradient of 98 mmHg, mean gradient of 60 mmHg, and peak velocity of 5 m/sec), trivial mitral regurgitation, 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, mild systolic pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and trivial pericardial effusion.
The patient was taken to catheterization which again showed several aortic stenosis with a gradient of 50 mmHg to 60 mmHg.
However, that the patient had a PCO2 in the 60s on arterial blood gas, it was felt that the patient was not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement.
However, on hospital day four, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with the following vital signs:  Heart rate was 124, blood pressure was 123/64, oxygen saturation was 97% on 5 liters nasal cannula.
However, three hours later, the patient did return back to atrial fibrillation with the following vital signs:  Heart rate was 125, blood pressure was 191/53, and oxygen saturation was 97% on 5 liters nasal cannula oxygen.
Also, he was anticoagulated with Coumadin with an INR goal of 2 to 2.5.
His lipid panel was checked and revealed that his cholesterol was 128, triglycerides were 100, high-density lipoprotein was 48, and low-density lipoprotein was 60.
On cardiac catheterization for the aortic stenosis, he only had 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery without any intervention.
Arterial blood gases were checked sequentially, and showed that his pH ranged from 7.33 to 7.41, and PCO2 ranged from 62 to 66.
Pulmonary function tests were obtained showing that he had an FEV1 of 1.11 (which is 69% of the predicted), FVC of 1.59 (which is 55% of the predicted), and FEV1:FVC ratio of 70 (which is 125% of the predicted), and DL/VA of 3.23 (which is 91% of the predicted).
Also, given the fact that his current FEV1 is 69% of the predicted, and that he was quite robust prior to his decompensation, severe underlying pulmonary etiology was unlikely.
Lovenox (until INR of 2 to 2.5 is reached).
