On presentation to the OSH ED, her T was 102, SBP was in 70's.
Admission labs: WBC 10.9 (up to 20 the next day with 20% bands), Hct 38 (down to 28 the next day), Cr 1.8, ALT 277, AST, 248, T bili 5.6 (direct 3.0).
ABG 7.28/32/151 (on 4L NC).
Blood culture from [**9-27**] grew GNR in [**1-18**] bottles.
Most recent INR 2.5.
Because of elevated liver enzymes, CT of the abd was done.
CT abd was of limited quality, but showed pancreatic swelling.
Neurology was consulted and by their exam felt that she had a subacute left basal ganglia infarct vs. subacute left cortical infarct involving temporal lobe, less likely right polyneuropathy.
MRI/MRA brain, carotid US and metabolic work up were recommended.
Head CT and carotid US were done (see results below).
CT abd/pelvis: limited study, edema around pancreas Head CT: "old right sided infarct" .
EKG [**2159-9-27**]: afib with RBBB pattern; ST depressions in V3-V6 not seen on prior EKG but cannot be interpreted with RBBB .
[**2159-9-27**]: Blood cultures 2/2 bottles of E. coli: resistant to gentamicin, sensitive to quinolones .
On admission:  [**2159-9-29**] 05:51PM   GLUCOSE-116* UREA N-39* CREAT-2.0* SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-15* ANION GAP-19 [**2159-9-29**] 05:51PM   ALT(SGPT)-173* AST(SGOT)-111* LD(LDH)-316* ALK PHOS-197* AMYLASE-48 TOT BILI-4.4* [**2159-9-29**] 06:19PM   LACTATE-2.5* [**2159-9-29**] 05:51PM   ALBUMIN-2.9* CALCIUM-6.7* PHOSPHATE-3.7 MAGNESIUM-1.9 [**2159-9-29**] 05:51PM   WBC-30.2* RBC-3.33* HGB-9.5* HCT-27.5* MCV-83 MCH-28.4 MCHC-34.4 RDW-15.3 [**2159-9-29**] 05:51PM   PT-26.2* PTT-33.0 INR(PT)-2.7* .
Blood cultures from OSH with found to be E. coli.
Presentation, exam, and elevated LFTs were consistent with cholangitis.
The patient was fluid bolused for volume resusitation and levophed was continued to keep the MAP >60.
After her pressors were stopped, the femoral central venous catheter that had been placed prior to transfer was removed.
EKG with old RBBB.
The patient was monitored on telemetry during her ICU stay.
After her blood pressure stabilized, an ACE inhibitor was introduced.
Intially, anticoagulation was held pre-ERCP and her INR was allowed to drift down.
Following the procedure, she was briefly heparin loaded while her coumadin was restarted with goal INR of [**1-18**].5.
Inr on d/c was 2.2.
As she will be anticoagulated with regard to the atrial fibrillation, the MRI was deferred to an outpatient evaluation.
Urine lytes were consistent with pre-renal azotemia.
Her creatinine trended down.
Upon discharge, her creatinine was 0.9. .
You should have an outpatient MRI done to evaluate for stroke.
