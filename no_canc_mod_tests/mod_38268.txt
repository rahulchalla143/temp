# Pseudomonas Pneumonia: Patient presented with worsening dyspnea, fever, leukocytosis (28), increased sputum production, and infiltrate seen on CXR suggestive of pneumonia.
Was hypoxic with oxygen saturations in the high 70s and was admitted to the MICU.
Patient will continue to need ongoing monitoring of oxygen saturations and suction as needed for secretions at LTAC facility.
Patient originally had low sat in the high 70s and was directly admitted to the MICU.
