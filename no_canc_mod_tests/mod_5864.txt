EKG Sinus bradycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-4-1**] a right bundle-branch block morphology is now present with associated QRS widening and QRS voltage is also slightly lower.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
He was transferred to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic management.
On post operative day two he had short episode of atrial fibrillation which he converted back to sinus rhythm without intervention, but betablockers were increased for heart rate control.
