Chest x-ray at that time revealed marked pulmonary edema.
His oxygen saturation was 84%.
His blood pressure was 80/50 in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 110 per minute.
The patient ruled in by cardiac enzymes as well as EKG for an inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular involvement.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the cardiac catheterization laboratory the patient was found to have significant three-vessel coronary artery disease as well as 4+ severe mitral regurgitation with a left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 75%.
The patient was emergently intubated in the cardiac catheterization laboratory for oxygen saturation of about 60% with pulmonary edema which was treated with Lasix, 100% oxygen and PEEP.
Later in the day on [**2119-5-9**] the patient was begun on CVVH due to massive fluid overload with attempt to remove large volume of fluid in the hope that the patient would be able to be weaned from the ECMO circuit and be able to oxygenate adequately.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy also on [**2119-5-10**] at approximately 3 PM which was unremarkable.
On the evening of [**2119-5-10**] the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory due to continued hemodynamic instability, where he underwent an atrial septostomy to decompress the left atrium.
A transseptal puncture was performed and the atrial septum was dilated and there was successful left to right shunting after the procedure.
After discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] he concurred with the family's wishes and at 8:40 to 8:50 in the morning the patient's vasoactive drips as well as ECMO were weaned to off and the patient ceased spontaneous respirations as well as heart rhythm at 8:55 this morning and was pronounced dead.
