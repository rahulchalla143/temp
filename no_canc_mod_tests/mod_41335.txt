Troponin I 5.72 at OSH, however MB here is 5 (no MB at OSH).
Echo showed likely preserved EF at >50% with no obvious wall motion abnormalities (however poor windows).
EF found to be preserved at >50%, likely had diastolic dysfunction in setting of acute MI.
The cardiac catheterization showed blockages in several arteries but the blockage that was causing the heart attack was opened with a balloon procedure.
You have been started on new medicines to help your heart recover from the heart attack and to prevent another heart attack.
