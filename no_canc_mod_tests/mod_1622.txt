02:33 NSR 76 bpm, normal axis, normal QRS+ QTc, primary AV block.
CXR [**2188-2-21**]: Endotracheal tube, central venous catheter, and nasogastric tube are in place.
ECHO [**2188-2-21**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Per report, her HR and BP eventually responded to Dopamine and Atropine at the outside hospital.
Cardiac enzymes were negative X 3, TSH normal.
An echo was performed on [**2188-2-21**], which revealed normal EF, no abnormalities.
Her bradycardia was eventually felt to be most likely medication-induced.
A CXR was initially suspicious for RML and RLL pneumonia, and she was started on Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone.
Cultures were sent.
Her cultures eventually grew E.coli in the urine, resistant to Ampicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin and Bactrim.
Her sputum cultures also grew E.coli, pansensitive.
Of note, a repeat PA/lateral was negative for pneumonia.
4) FEN/Renal: Ms. [**Known lastname 10446**] had a metabolic acidosis on admission due to lactic acidosis, ARF (peak creatinine [**1-2**] on admission), and elevated LFT's felt secondary to hypoperfusion in the setting of drug-induced bradycardia.
5) Anemia: Her Hct dropped to a nadir of 27.3 on [**2188-2-23**], and she was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs with appropriate Hct response.
Hemolysis work-up also negative.
Further work-up will be left to the out-patient setting.
