CXR [**5-15**]:  Low lung volumes, without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
b/l LE dopplers [**2156-5-16**]:  No evidence of DVT  CTA Chest [**2156-5-16**]: 1.
Bilateral basal pulmonary atelectasis and pleural effusions, which have also increased since the previous CT. 4.
TTE [**2156-5-17**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-5-4**], the pericardial effusion new and early tamponade physiology is suggested.
Clinical correlation and serial evaluation is suggested.
TTE [**2156-5-18**]: The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
The effusion appears circumferential with a layer of echo dense material, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements anterior to the RV.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-5-17**], the findings are similar.
Cardiac Cath [**2156-5-18**]: 1.
Successful pericardiocentesis of 220 cc bloody fluid.
HEMODYNAMICS: RV 42/8, PCW 16, PA 43/18, mean 28, RA 16.
Post procedure RA pressure went drom 15->10 pericardial pressure from 15->3.
Pericardial Fluid Cytology [**2156-5-18**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
TTE #2 [**2156-5-18**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-5-18**], the echo lucent pericardial effusion is no longer appreciated.
TTE [**2156-5-19**]: The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-5-18**], the effusion appears smaller.
LE dopplers were negative and CTA chest did not show PE but was significant for new pericardial effusion.
Echocardiogram on [**2156-5-17**] showed large pericardial effusion with some RV collapse.
She was given IV fluid and her pulsus was monitored and was stable at 12.
Repeat echocardiogram [**5-18**] showed continued evidence of tamponade and she underwent pericardiocentesis.
Post procedure RA pressure went drom 15->10 pericardial pressure from 15->3.
Post procedure echo showed resolution of the effusion and residual fibrinous material.
She was monitored in the CCU after pericardiocentesis and repeat Echocardiograms showed no further reaccumulation of fluid.
Pericardial fluid was sent and based on her laboratories, the effusion appeared possibly hemorrhagic, likely from pericarditis.
Cytology was negative for malignancy.
Of note, her pericardial fluid grew Strep viridans but all of her blood cultures were negative.
ID was consulted and left the following impression:  "The appearance of Strep viridans in broth only is highly suspicious of a contaminant; this possibility is enforced by the failure of blood culture bottles innoculated at drainage to grow at all.
Strep viridans pericarditis is highly unlikely clinically in the absence of endocarditis, and the patient has had negative blood cultures and no clear evidence of valvular disease.
Her ECHO showed EF>55%.
TSH was sent and was found to be high with a normal free T4.

Echocardiogram showed accumulation of fluid around the heart that was not present on your previous admission.
