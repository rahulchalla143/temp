Please refer to CT of the abdomen and pelvis for full description of other significant findings.
[**2123-10-8**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis 1) Non-calcified 4 mm lung nodules require CT follow up within six to 12 months.
2) Bilateral renal hyperdense and hypodense lesions, which may represent simple and hemorrhagic cysts though evaluation is incomplete on this noncontrast study.
Further evaluation with multiphasic CT or MRI is recommended.
[**2123-10-8**] CT Head 1.
[**2123-10-8**] ECG - Ventricular paced rhythm.
Compared to prior tracing of [**2123-8-4**] atrial pacing is no longer clearly seen.
[**10-15**] CT C-spine w/out contrast: Comparison is made to the preoperative studies from [**2123-10-8**].
The evaluation of the intraspinal contents is somewhat limited due to streak artifacts from the orthopedic hardware.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2123-10-18**] 9:00 AM In comparison with the study of [**10-14**], there is no interval change.
Given that the fall was unwitnessed, patient underwent a syncope evaluation.
Regarding structural heart disease, patient has had an echocardiogram on [**11-4**] which had no evidence of aortic stenosis or other structural defect.
Regarding neurological event, seizure remained on the differential given his history.
ECHO [**11-4**] no evidence of AS or other structural defect that could explain syncope.
CT showed no evidence of bleed to suggest hemorrhagic stroke.
Patient's blood culture was negative.
Coronary Artery Disease Patient's cardiac enzymes were negative and his ECG remained unremarkable.
His ACEI and beta blocker were initially held due to the need to maintain an SBP > 120 in the perioperative state.
His ACEI and beta blocker were initially held as discussed in #3 CAD.
HTN: Goal SBP is > 90 to maintain spinal perfusion.
He was restarted on lisinopril and should be restarted on his beta blocker as his SBP tolerates.
His INR and coumadin dose will need to be monitored daily.
Please monitor INR daily and titrate coumadin dosage accordingly.
Spinal Cord Compression C4-5; C6-7 3.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation after your fall.
You will need to have a speech and swallow evaluation repeated during your stay at rehab.
You will need to have your INR and coumadin dose monitored daily until you are again therapeutic with an INR between [**1-2**].
We have restarted this and you will need to monitor your tegretol levels every 3 days until it is considered therapeutic.
- Senna and bisacodyl - we added these medications to maintain regular bowel movements.
You will also need a CT scan of your neck.
Your radiology appointment for your CT scan will be on [**11-3**] at 11:45am on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] on the Clinical Center [**Location (un) **].
You also have an appointment with your podiatrist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1575**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15351**], DPM on [**2123-10-28**] 3:30.
