**FINAL REPORT [**2144-2-22**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2144-2-22**]):    NO GROWTH.
CT head/CTA head/ neck [**2-21**] 1.
Ischemic infarction is evident on CT perfusion as matched increase of mean transit time and decreased blood volume blood flow to the right MCA distribution.
CT head [**2-22**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2-22**] There is no focal consolidation, the CP angles are clear.
Pulmonary vascular markings, heart and mediastinal contours are normal in this patient with a scoliotic thoracic spine, convex to the right.
TEE [**2-26**] The left atrium is dilated.
The right peroneal, left peroneal, and left posterior tibial veins demonstrate normal flow.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to neurology service for evaluation of sudden onset weakness on the left side of body.
She was later transfered to Neuro ICU for evaluation and close observation.
Her initial physical examination was suggestive of significant left sided weakness with left heminegelct, however, post IV tPA , she showed consistent steady improvement and has very mild left sided weakness with no neglect on the left side at discharge.
She underwent TEE for finding out the source of potential embolus as vessel imaging did not show any evidence.
TEE showed ASD with PFO and septal aneurysm, she underwent ultrasound of legs which showed DVT in right posterioir tibial veins.
she underwent secondary risk factor assesment, glycated Hb was 5.6 and lipids were in accepatable range and she was continued on simvastatin in the dose of 40 mg per day.
She was evaluated with CBC chem 10 UA and LFTs with abd Xray , all of which were normal.
after careful review and GI consult, it was found that nausea was related to sinemet dose and she was started on carbidopa additional dose.
Carvedilol 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] 5.
Cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] 8.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO once a day: please take 3 mg tablet on [**3-19**], [**3-1**] and check blood work on Monday in [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] as discussed and [**Hospital 86669**] clinic would adjust the dose.
You underwent CT scan of head with CTA head/ neck which showed acute infarct in right MCA.
You were given a medicine called "tPA" to lyse the blood clot blocking brain vessel leading to weakness on the left side of your body, with considerable improvement in the weakness.
You underwent TEE (transesophageal cardiac ultrasound) which showed a hole in septum of heart called PFO, ASD with a small septal anerysm.
Your blood level will be checked by coumadin clinic and the dose would be adjusted.
