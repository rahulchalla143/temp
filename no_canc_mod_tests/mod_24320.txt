At the OSH he was noted to have an NIHSS of 6 for LOC, facial palsy, language, dysarthria and decision was made to not give tPA and to send to [**Hospital1 18**] for additional care.
On arrival his exam was noted to be consistent with [**Hospital1 **] exam, however he quickly worsened and his speech deficits became more profound.
He had a bolus of 6 mg of tPA administered at 1:30 am.

ECHO ([**2136-6-26**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT head ([**2136-6-26**]): No acute hemorrhage or CT evidence of an acute major vascular territorial infarction.
CT head ([**2136-6-26**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR (Portable AP) ([**2136-6-26**]): The image quality is reduced, with missing parts of the left lung.
CT head ([**2136-6-27**]): No acute hemorrhage.
CT head: ([**2136-6-28**]): No significant change.
His NIHSS on presentation at [**Hospital1 18**] was 14.
His exam was notable for a now global aphasia, with a right facial droop and minor amount of weakness in the right arm and leg.
The exact time of onset was unknown, an it seemed his exam was getting worse between [**Hospital1 **] and getting to the [**Hospital1 **] ED.
The patient developed epistaxis post-tPA that required packing by ENT, but this did not recur and HCT was stable.
His neurologic examination improved over the following 24 hours after tPA, with some improvement in comprehension (able to follow simple commands), but he remained unable to produce any appropriate speech.
Review of head CT at 24 hours revealed left MCA corona radiata infarct, consistent with a cardioembolic source.
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left atrium size, normal global systolic function, and no thrombus.
There, his physical exam was notable for continued nonfluent dysarthric speech and right-sided weakness; in particular, there was a right facial droop and mild right upper and lower extremity weakness (motor strength 4-5 out of 5).
A repeat physical exam revealed that he had increased dysarthria, increased right facial droop, and noticeably worsened right-sided strength (motor strength 0-1 out of 5).
A repeat head CT did not show any significant change from before.
A repeat physical exam after his head CT discovered that his strength had returned ([**4-24**] out of 5 in his right upper and lower extremities).
A head MRI showed multiple tiny foci of acute ischemia within the left MCA territory, consistent with the patient's presumed cardioembolic stroke, but no new areas of infarction.
An EEG showed general left-sided slowing without evidence of ongoing seizures.
At discharge, the patient's physical exam was notable for mild dysarthria, right facial droop, mild right upper and lower extremity weakness (motor strength 4-5 out of 5).
UTI: Patient had a positive UA at admission, but the urine culture was contaminated.
Outpatient Lab Work Creatinine every week - if patient GFR > 35, will need to increase dabigatran dosage.
You initially went to [**Hospital **] Hospital and were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
