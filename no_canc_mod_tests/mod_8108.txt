Admission Date:  [**2138-8-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2138-8-18**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old male transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital status post cardiac catheterization on the morning of admission for possible left circumflex intervention.
His cardiac history is as follows: In [**2126**] he had a coronary artery bypass graft with an SVG to PDA and SVG to diagonal graft.
His last catheterization was in [**2135**].
He underwent an exercise treadmill test last week, exercising 6 minutes with a blunted heart rate response secondary to beta blockade.
The test was stopped due to dyspnea on exertion and EKG revealed non diagnostic ST changes, however, Cardiolite demonstrated a probable reversible defect involving the anteroseptal wall, apex and partial inferior wall.
The patient underwent elective cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on the morning of admission and was found to have an ejection fraction of 50%, an LM of 20%, a left circumflex 80-90% and LAD of 10%, diagonal of 90%, RCA of 100%, SVG to PDA of 50%, SVG to diagonal patent.
LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 44, white blood cell count 6.4, platelet count 250,000, sodium 139, potassium 5, chloride 98, CO2 28, BUN 12, creatinine .8, glucose 93, INR .8.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  During his cardiac catheterization on the day of admission, there was a complication involving the PTCA/stent of OM causing jailing of his AV groove, left circumflex with loss of dissection of his lower OM.
The patient had CT of abdomen and pelvis showing mild to moderate hematoma and no retroperitoneal bleed.
He was transferred to the CCU on [**8-13**] for further management of his chest pain, hypotension and decreased hematocrit.
The patient ruled in for an MI by enzymes, likely secondary to include OM/jailed AV groove, left circumflex with positive CKs which peaked at 763/45 on [**8-13**].
Once he became hemodynamically stable on [**8-13**] he was started on Metoprolol and Captopril which were titrated upwards as blood pressure tolerated.
This was thought to be secondary to difference in blood pressure cuff measurements between the floor and CCU as his blood pressure was not as low when measured in the CCU after.
The patient had a bedside echo on [**8-12**] which was notable for a limited view of left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, no obvious effusion but could not rule out possible effusion, no tamponade was noted.
An official TTE on [**8-13**] showed post echo density consistent with pericardial effusion hematoma, etc.
The patient will most likely get an outpatient stress test with EF evaluation as an outpatient.
The patient's initial hematocrit drop of 10 points may have reflected blood loss from two catheterizations and dilution after 4-6 liters of fluid resuscitation, however, he received two units of packed red blood cells on the morning of [**8-13**] and his hematocrit was checked [**Hospital1 **], remaining fairly stable.
Ultrasound was done on [**8-14**] revealing a 5 by 3 bilobed pseudoaneurysm with a narrow neck associated with the right common femoral artery.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable.
A repeat ultrasound was done on the day of discharge which revealed a successful thrombosing of the right groin pseudoaneurysm.
He was noted to have several bradycardic episodes overnight with heart rate as low as mid 40's, but these only occurred overnight while the patient was sleeping.
