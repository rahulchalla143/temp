ECHO ([**2149-6-10**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are top normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CT C-spine non-con ([**2149-6-10**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT head non-con ([**2149-6-10**]): IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
CXR ([**2149-6-12**]): Transvenous right atrial lead curls anteriorly, its tip projecting over the anterior wall of the mid portion of the right atrium.
The right ventricular lead passes to the mid portion of the right ventricle.

SBP increased to 150s with capture of external pacing.
Also considered hypothyroidism - TSH was elevated at 10 but free T4 was normal so no adjustments to his levothryoxine were made.
Blood cultures were drawn to r/o endocarditis (pt has abnormal valves so would be at risk) but were NGTD.
However, he intermittently went back into complete heart block requiring pacing, most notably after receiving large metoprolol load prior to CTA torso/coronaries in order to bring heart rate down for coronary imaging.
His metoprolol was increased to 50mg daily (succinate) for better rate control.
obtained echo which showed AoVA of 0.9 cm^2.
Peak gradient over valve was 91mmHg and mean gradient was 50mmHg.
Pt taken for cardiac cath on [**2149-6-16**], report also pending at the time of discharge.
bilateral LE dopplers were neg for DVT and RUE doppler (side of entry for pacemaker) showed "acute thrombosis of the right basilic and cephalic (superficial) veins.
Checked thyroid studies in the setting of CHB.
Results were TSH 10, T4 7.4, T3 70, Free T4 1.4 so no changes were made to home levothyroxine dose.
# Renal failure: The patient had [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr of 2.5 upon admission to the CCU, likely from poor forward flow from cardiogenic shock secondary to profound bradycardia.
Patient should have thyroid function tests followed up as outpatient.
You were found to have a heart rate in the 30s and your blood pressure was low.
You were given a pacemaker and your heart rate and blood pressure improved.
If your symptoms recur, your pacemaker will prevent your heart rate from dropping low.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32655**] NP will be contacting you at home regarding the next step.
CHANGE metoprolol to 50mg once a day (long acting version).
START taking lovenox injections twice daily to prevent the blood clots in your lungs from getting bigger.
