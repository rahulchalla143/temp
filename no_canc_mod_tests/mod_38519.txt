CXR [**1-18**]: Since examination of [**2173-11-29**], there has been interval improvement in moderate pulmonary interstitial edema, though mild interstitial pulmonary edema persists, as manifested by prominence of the interstitial markings and redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-8-14**], no major change is evident.
Limited hemodynamics demonstrated minimally elevated left sided filling pressures with LVEDP=13 mmHg.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
TTE [**2174-1-19**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-11-23**], mitral regurgitation is now more prominent, the right ventricle is now larger and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
CXR [**2174-1-18**] FINDINGS: Since examination of [**2173-11-29**], there has been interval improvement in moderate pulmonary interstitial edema, though mild interstitial pulmonary edema persists, as manifested by prominence of the interstitial markings and redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature.
Renal U/S [**2174-1-20**] FINDINGS: The renal transplant is visualized in the right lower quadrant, and measures 11.4 cm longitudinally.
On color Doppler, there is adequate perfusion of the renal transplant.
The peak systolic velocity in the main renal artery is 135 cm/sec.
Renal biopsy PATHOLOGY: 1.
# Dyspnea/acute on chronic diastolic CHF: With mild elevation in weight here, no associated symptoms, and elevated BNP, as well as CXR findings, concerning for acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation.
With immunosuppression, and recent CT lung findings of ground glass, concerning for opportunistic infection or lymphoproliferative d/o causing a primary pulmonary process.
CXR did not show a pneumonia.
Ischemia in the differential, however CEs not elevated and EKG unchanged and patient without CP.
A TTE showed worsened mitral regurgitation.
Patient underwent renal biopsy that was complicated by hemoperitoneum.
It was ultimately decided by the renal transplant team to continue patient on home Lasix upon discharge and Metolazone 2.5mg daily as needed (if weight gain exceeds 2 pounds daily when checked in the mornings post-void).
Iron, B12 and folate studies were significant for elevated ferritin, as likely acute phase reactant.
Patient developed hemoperitoneum during renal biopsy, associated with hypotension and Hct drop from 33.6 to 27.7.
Daily tacrolimus levels never exceeded therapeutic level for any concerns of renal toxicity.
Urine sediment did not have evidence of ATN.
Transplant kidney ultrasound on [**1-20**] showed possible rejection so patient underwent a biopsy of her kidney graft on [**2173-1-24**] for evaluation of her acute on chronic renal failure that was complicated by hemoperitoneum, hypotension, and hct drop from 33.6 to 27.7.
Her hematocrit eventually stabilized.
Patient's renal biopsy pathology ultimately was negative for acute cellular or humoral rejection.
With gentle diuresis and discontinued [**Last Name (un) **], patient's creatinine trended down to 2.6.
# HTN: Goal SBP 130.
Once her blood pressure (SBP150-160s) and hematocrit stabilized, patient was gradually resumed on her blood pressure medications, starting with Metoprolol and then Amlodipine.

Your weight at discharge was 147.6 pounds.
You had an ultrasound of your kidney which was concerning for rejection of your transplant.
Renal biopsy samples, however, showed NO acute rejection of your kidney transplant.
Unfortunately, you bled internally after the biopsy procedure.
