Selective coronary angiography revealed a co-dominant system with 3-vessel coronary disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated filling pressures with equalization of RA, PCW, RVEDP, and LVEDP consistent with right ventricular infarction and "pseudo-constriction" pattern.
Right ventricular presure tracing demonstrated the "square root sign" with dip-and-plateau pattern and RV systolic pressure of 38 and RVEDP of 26 mmHg.
The pulmonary artery pressure was mildly elevated (mean PA 27 mmHg).
Simultaneous LVEDP and PCW tracing revealed a respirophasic variation between early LV diastolic pressure and PCW pressure greater than 5 mmHg.
Cardiac index was markedly depressed at 1 L/min/m2.
After administration of dobutamine 5 mcg/kg/min, cardiac index increased to 1.3 L/min/m2.
Left ventriculography was deferred given renal dysfunction and need for PCI.
Final angiography demonstrated a minimal residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no  angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with apical and distal septal akinesis/dyskinesis.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Her LFTs were somewhat high and a cholesterol panel showed good lipid levels.
A work up revealed that her increased LFTs were not secondary to hepatitis, but more likely from hepatic congestion.
She was given mucomyst 600 PO BID x 2 days and pre catheterization IVF with bicarbonate to protect her kidneys.
By discharge, her blood pressure and heart rate were well controlled on lisinopril and metoprolol.
Ms. [**Known lastname 94216**] was found to be hyperglycemic with blood sugar over 500 and an anion gap of 18.
It was thought that this was precipitated by her MI, given that infectious causes were ruled out with negative urine and blood cultures.
Her hemoglobin A1C was found to be >8, reflecting chronically poor control.
Her NPH and regular insulin sliding scale were titrated up.
Her baseline creatinine 0.9 was but her failure was thought to reflect a prerenal etiology but may be intrinsic secondary to use of celebrex.
Her FENA was consistent with a prerenal etiology.
Her celebrex was stopped and her ACE I was held.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: myocardial infarct diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: good  Discharge Instructions: Continue your new medications.
Please have your antihypertensives adjusted according to your heart rate and blood pressure.
Your chem 7 and digoxin level should be checked in a week.
