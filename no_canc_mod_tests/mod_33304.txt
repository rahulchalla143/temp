Her grand-daughter is [**Name2 (NI) 116**] [**Name (NI) 83527**] cell phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 83528**]  Family History: No history of strokes, seizures, brain tumors or procoagulant conditions.
Registers [**3-15**], did not want to attempt to recall the objects (said that her head hurt).
Pertinent Results: CT CNS: Large left cerebellar hemisphere hypodensity consistent with evolving infarction.
CT/ CTA: 7/ 8/ 09: Normal CTA.
There is effacement of the fourth ventricle with enlargement of the third ventricle suggestive of possible obstructive hydrocephalus, which appears similar to study performed approximately 12 hours earlier.
LVEF >55.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2140-7-22**] 4:16 AM Finding consistent with postsurgical decompression of the posterior fossa and right frontal ventriculostomy catheter placement.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2140-7-25**] 5:51 AM Little interval change to appearance of the evolving left cerebellar infarct.

Her serum osmolalitites and  Na where within target range.
A follow CT/ CTA showed no vessel obstruction.
There is effacement of the fourth ventricle with enlargement of the third ventricle suggestive of possible obstructive hydrocephalus, which appears similar to study performed approximately 12 hours earlier.
Neurological exam was stable with translator, CT scan was also stable.
On [**7-21**], head CT showed increase in ventricle size and given hypertonic saline overnight.On [**7-22**] patient was taken emergently to OR and had a post fossa craniotomy with EVD placement, EVD was at 15.
Repeat head CT was stable.
She moved her R upper extremity greater than her left, her EVD was decreased to 15mmH20 and head CT was improved.
Plan to wean to 112.5mg on [**7-26**] and on [**7-27**] increase the height of her EVD to 20.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
