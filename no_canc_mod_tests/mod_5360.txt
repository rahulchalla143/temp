If clinically indicated, MRI or CT could help to further assess this finding.
EMS found him to be in afib with RVR (120s) and in respiratory distress.
EKG showed a.fibb with RVR, Peak troponin 0.56.
Initial workup at the OSH showed an elevated BNP of 310, elevated WBC to 14.
He did spike a temp to 101 and was started on vancomycin and imipenem after blood and urine cultures obtained.
ECHO done showed stable cardiomyopathy (EF 10%) and CXR with infrahilar opacification.
Sputum cultures grew proteums with GS + GPC (pairs/clusters), GPR and GN diploccci.
Pt felt to be severely volume overloaded and wt as droped over 30 kg since coming to CCU.
Discussed pt's situation with his brother and his fiancee (in person) and with his other borhter (on the phone) and it was decided on [**9-21**], [**2174**] to make Mr. [**Known lastname 5395**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] measures only.
The WBC remained stable, sputum cultures + for pan-sensitive proteus, urine legionella Ag neg, sputum legionella cx neg to date, CT/CXR with b/l lower lobe consolidations.
A [**9-7**] WBC scan [**Last Name (un) **] only minor chest wall focus with no major chest or abd finding.
On [**9-11**] culture + MSSA in sputum and + pseudomonas in urine, and fever increased to 104.
BP remains low, HR high, febrile, unclear at this time if picture is septic or cardiogenic shock.
On [**9-20**] his fevers climbed to 104.5 despite continued q6h tylenol.
They remained unexplained; LUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of abscess near PEG tube site, TEE had no vegetations, chest/abdomen/pelvis CT showed no abscess or other concerning intrabdominal process.
Despite this, his temperature rose to 106.9 so after a 6 hour trial these measures were d/c'ed.
Throughout [**9-21**], pt's SBP remained low with SBP consistently in 50s.
Pt had large bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube and an ileus on CT that resolved after TF were held.
Abdominal CT on [**9-20**] showed dilated bowel loops concerning for c. difficile colitis, but no obstruction or abscess.
Urine output and Cr improved by [**9-19**], however by [**9-21**], in the setting of very high fevers and hypotension his urine output dropped to zero for multiple hours.
TTKG calculated [**9-12**] = 12.7, suggesting renal K loss.
Anti-coagulation held at first because of coagulopathy and then re-started with goal INR [**3-6**].
On 8  # COAGULOPATHY Possible sources since the last coumadin was given on [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.
Gave Vit K 10mg QD X 3 daysfibrinogen and haptoglobin high so likely not DIC.
