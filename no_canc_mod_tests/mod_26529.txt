Of note, CT Abd revealed right ureteral stent, nonspecific perinephric stranding unchanged from [**2110-7-16**].
Urine Cx from OSH grew Klebsiella Pneumonia ESBL+ sensitive to cefepime, but urine culture from here grew two different strains of K. Pneumonia resistant to cefepime.
We did not consult urology since pt has an outpt appt and is doing OK clinically.
# C. difficile diarrhea: Patient has fever, WBC > 15.
He has evidence of sepsis and elevated serum lactate (> 2.5), which may be from sepsis from a urinary source.
# DM2: Blood sugars consistently were in the 300's at the beginning of the admission, so a standing bedtime dose of Lantus was added to his sliding scale.
# Congestive heart failure: There is no ECHO on file at [**Hospital1 18**] or atrius but per reports, patient has history of ?
An ECHO was ordred prior to his discharge from the ICU, results above.
EKG done on [**8-23**] showed asymmetric t-wave inversions in V1, meaning possible left heart strain.
Given his cardiac history, findings of edema and lung sounds, and the fluid recussitation, the most likely reason for the strain was the NS bolus during septic shock.
