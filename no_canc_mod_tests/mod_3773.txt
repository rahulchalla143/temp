Upper lung opacities that might represent infection versus pulmonary dema.
Pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded but should be correlated with clinical findings.
ECHO [**2142-6-14**] The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
She was also diuresed intermittently because her chest x-ray demonstrated some pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.
However, at times her systolic blood pressure fell to the 80s with diuresis.
# Altered mental status: She was lethargic and minimally arousable at presentation but had an arterial blood glass that demonstrated a normal pH.
TSH, B12, and RPR were negative.
Digoxin level at presentation was normal at 1.7.
