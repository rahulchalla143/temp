Admission Date:  [**2106-9-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-9-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2023-8-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent placement to the third obtuse marginal coronary branch (OM3).
He drove home and called for an ambulance within one hour of the onset of his chest pain.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] in the ED the patient reported [**3-25**] chest pain and his EKG was notable for ST depressions in V1-V3.
Posterior EKG was done which showed ST elevations in posterior V3-V6.
STEMI protocol was initiated and MR. [**Known lastname **] was given a load of 600mg Plavix, IV Heparin bolus, and started on Nitroglycerin drip.
The ST elevations resolved on repeat EKG with these treatments and the patient's chest pain decreased to [**12-24**] and was stable at that level leading up to his presentation to the CCU.
Of note, the patient had an episode of chest pain in [**2095**] which led to emergent cardiac catheterization with BMS placement to OM3.
Unfortunately, subsequent to his MI in [**2095**] he endured a frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage immediately after the hospitalization for this procedure which was attributed to a combination of poorly controlled hypertension and several anticoagulants, including ticlid, aspirin, and heparin.

Additional Blood Cultures drawn [**2106-9-29**], [**2106-9-30**] have no growth to date but final results pending.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and a 50% residual stenosis.
[**2106-9-29**]  CXR (PA and Lateral):  Retrocardiac lung areas are free of consolidations, no pneumonias.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also marked by a Pseudogout episode and a positive blood culture for coagulase negative staphyococcus which was likely a contaminant as outlined below.
CAD / POSTERIOR STEMI: Mr. [**Known lastname 94783**] initial EKG was notable for ST depressions in V1-V3.
Posterior EKG was done which showed ST elevations in posterior V3-V6.
STEMI protocol was initiated and the patient was given a load of 600mg Plavix, IV Heparin bolus, and started on Nitroglycerin drip.
He was admitted to the CCU for further management and a left sided cardiac catheterization was arranged soon after the patient was admitted.
Of note, the patient's CK level peaked on [**2106-9-27**] at 1164, with peak Trops of 2.52, MB-I 14.5 and CK-MB 133.
On physical exam he demonstrated no crackles or rales on lung exam and minimal lower extremity edema.
Post-catheterization ECHO (TTE) done [**2106-9-28**] showed LVEF of 55% with mild diastolic dysfunction (Grade 1), trivial MR, no AS and mild symmetrical LVH.
RHYTHM: EKG on hospital day 1 revealed some evidence of ectopic atrial pacer beats  exhibited by inverted p-wave in II, III, aVF with shorter PR.
A joint aspiration/tap was performed by the orthopedic service and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have joint fluid calcium pyrophosphate crystals with rhomboid shape that were positively bifringent and consistent with Pseudogout.
Of note, the joint fluid gram stain was negative for any microorganisms and the total WBCs were 26,000 which indicated an inflammatory process but not quite high enough to suspect septic joint.
The patient's right knee x-ray showed no new changes, just his baseline  known osteophytic changes and joint space narrowing with chondrocalcinosis that was equivalent to his [**12/2104**] x-ray.
BACTEREMIA:   The patient had blood cultures drawn on admission on [**2106-9-27**] which revealed [**1-18**] positive samples/cultures with gram positive cocci which were later identified as coagulase negative staphylococcus species.
However, after cultures revealed coagulase negative species on [**2106-9-29**] it was felt that the culture results may have been tainted by a normal skin contaminant.
With the exception of a fever of 101 on hospital day 2, the patient had no ongoing fevers, chills, headaches, cough, URI symptoms and he had a clear CXR.
Moreover, he had negative urine cultures, negative knee fluid cultures and no noted leukocytosis.
At time of discharge the plan was to follow-up all pending cultures from [**Date range (3) 94784**] which have shown no growth to date.
HTN - Amlodipine was held and eventually discontinued as the patient had good BP control with SBP ranges in the 120s on uptitrated doses of beta-blockers and ace-inhibitors during his stay.
He had fasting glucose levels in the 140-180 range and he was asked to follow-up with his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
During this admission Mr. [**Known lastname 94783**] Hgb A1c collected was suboptimal with level of 7.2. .
Disp:*30 * Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Right Knee Pseudogout Hypertension Compensated Systolic Heart Failure Hyperglycemia, A1C 7.2   Discharge Condition: Stable, A1C 7.2 BUN 29 Creat 1.0 Hct: 35   Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and a cardiac catheterization.
Your blood sugars were somewhat high during this hospital stay.
Subsequent blood cultures were negative and it is likely this bacteria was a contaminant from the top of the bottle.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4390**] if you develop any fevers, chills, shakes, lightheadedness, chest pain, nausea, trouble breathing or any other concerning symptoms.
New medicines: Your simvastatin was increased to 80 mg Plavix: to prevent the stent from clotting off Lisinopril: to control your blood pressure Your aspirin was increased to 325mg Metoprolol XL: to control your heart rate and prevent another heart attack.
