Head CT was negative for acute stroke.
MRI showed a "cystic/encephalomalacic change in the right superior frontal gyrus and left medial cerebellar hemisphere without evidence of enhancement."
MRA showed patent ant/post circulation.
On morning rounds at 9:25am, he was observed to have 30sec of left hand shaking then his left face, with right gaze deviation and eye opening/closure and no responsiveness.

Admission CXR [**4-2**]: There is no focal abnormality in the lungs to indicate aspiration but elevation of the left hemidiaphragm may reflect acute volume loss from aspirated material in the left lower lobe bronchus.
Most recent CXR [**2148-4-15**]: Ill-defined right infrahilar opacity persists with no new focal infiltrates or evidence of pulmonary edema.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are within normal limits.
Admission EEG [**4-2**]: ABNORMALITY #1: The right hemisphere revealed a [**1-7**] Hz low voltage slowing throughout the record.
EEG telemetry [**4-4**]: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured five electrographic seizures.
EEG telemetry [**4-5**]: This 24-hour EEG telemetry captured six electrographic seizures by automated detection.
Compared to the prior day's recording, the encephalopathy appeared slightly improved.
His valproate level was found to be therapeutic initially and he was seen to have left-sided focal seizures of his arm/face (thought to be due to R frontal tumor resection).
Continuous EEG monitoring showed electrographic seizures with R temporal onset (see full EEG report above).
A1c and lipid panel were checked (see results above) and were at goal.
Blood, urine, and blood cultures were negative throughout his course.
He had some episodes of desaturation, but given that he was afebrile and CXR findings were stable, these were felt to be due to mucous plugging.
Depakote level was checked and was subtherapeutic at 48, so Depakote was increased to 1250 TID.
His inattention improved with this intervention.
