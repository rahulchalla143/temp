He presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital and underwent an imaging study of the head which reportedly showed a sinus infection.
EXAM ON DISCHARGE: He is pleasant and cooperative.
CT head [**9-16**] IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a right frontal approach external ventricular drain with interval decrease in size of the lateral and third ventricles with persistent extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular blood.
Cerebral angiogram [**9-16**] FINDINGS: The left vertebral artery arteriogram re-demonstrates the presence of a fusiform short segment dissecting basilar aneurysm with an exophytic component measuring 2 - 3 mm in diameter.
The right common carotid arteriogram demonstrates no significant abnormality.
The cervical, petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid segments of the ICA filled normally.
The left common carotid arteriogram demonstrates no significant abnormality.
The cervical, petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid segments of the ICA filled normally.
CTA Head [**9-18**] 1.
Thinner appearance of the intracerebral arteries suggesting mild vasospasm  ECHO [**9-17**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CTA head [**9-22**] IMPRESSION: 1.
[**9-27**] Portable abdomen- FINDINGS:  There are dilated gas-filled loops of both large and small bowel, most likely reflecting an adynamic ileus pattern related to the diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.
[**10-3**] CT Head: There has been interval improvement/resolution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage when compared to the prior study.
[**10-8**] CT head: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or large acute territorial infarction.
[**2166-10-9**]: CTA head - 1.

On [**9-17**]: Cervical Spine imaging report was reviewed which did not show a fracture in the Cervical spine and patient's Hard Collar was removed after examination which involved range of motion testing.
His dilantin level was low so he was loaded with 500 mg of dilantin, he continued to experience headache.
He also underwent CTA of the head which showed mild vasospasm but didn't require intervention.
On [**9-19**] his exam remained stable and his headache was controlled with narcotic pain medication with his EVD at 20 cm H2O.
On [**9-22**], a CTA was done which showed stable SAH and decreased IVH, but diffused vasospasm.
His exam remained unchanged.
On [**9-23**], his IVF were increased to 125 mL/hr and his blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate up to 180.
His serum NA began to trend down.
On [**9-24**], his exam remained stable and his serum NA stabilized.
Repeat CTA preliminary read persistent diffuse vasospasm, particularly within the basilar artery as seen  on the prior study from [**9-22**].
Serum Sodium was 131 and the patient continued on Sodium Chloride tablets at 2 grams po TID.
His WBC was trending up, despite remaining afebrile so a urine and blood cx were sent.
CSF was sent for microbio and culture.
In the afternoon, patient was febrile and CSF was resent.
Blood cultures and urine were also sent.
Serum sodium was stable at 134.
His EVD output remained low as well and after discussion with Dr. [**Known firstname **] and ID the plan was developed for another clamping trial for the possibility of avoiding permanent VP shunting.
CT head was performed on [**10-8**] after 24 hours of clamping the drain, there was no hydrocephalus and the EVD was removed.
His exam remained stable.
OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  10 mg PO Q4H:PRN pain 14.
