airway issues with tracheostomy here for bronchoscopy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**11-9**]: flexible bronchoscopy [**11-10**]: re cannulation of tracheostomy and capping  [**2141-11-16**]:  Excessive mucus plugs and secretions in the T-tube with subglottic proximal mucosalswelling and edema.
Patient underwent flex bronch today in the OR under deep sedation (No rigid bronch was performed due to concern about spinal instablility) showed  small/ moderate granulation tissue/ridge in proximal trachea ant wall with severe cervical malacia proximal to the trach tube with complete dynamic collapse.
Physical Exam: T 99.3  BP 152/84  HR 65 RR 23  O2 Sat 99% on 3 L. GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly female, in no significant respiratory distress.
She has a tracheostomy tube, which is just lateral to the midline.

FINAL REPORT [**2141-11-13**]**    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2141-11-13**]):       GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a flexible bronchoscopy which showed small/ moderate granulation tissue/ridge in proximal trachea anterior wall with severe cervical malacia proximal to the trach tube with complete dynamic collapse.
Her trach was immediately uncapped and her airway was suctioned vigorously with good response.
Her ABG was notable for mild respiratory acidosis consistent with respiratory failure.
Do not feel that there is evidence of new pneumonia at this time (no WBC elevation, no fever); will continue to monitor for signs/symptoms of infection.
CXR with LLL opacity consistant with resolving mucous plugging - npo for now, consider soft diet after stable on trach mask - weaned off ventilation, now on TM at 40% - continue to monitor closely and suction prn - IP team to see today to decide dispo ??????
Artifact could represent chest compressions and no other telemetry strips printed from time of event.
Cardiac enzymes sent peri-code negative and ekg is unchanged from prior.
- repeat EKG without any new changes - cardiac enzymes neg x2 [**44**] hrs apart, no need for 3rd set.
She underwent diagnostic/therapeutic bronchoscopy on [**11-16**] and mucus was cleared from her airways.
