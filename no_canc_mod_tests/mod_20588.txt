On admission, the patient was found to have a UTI which was treated with 3 days of Levofloxacin 500mg.
For his pneumonia, for which he began treatment on his previous admission, an endotracheal sputum (stain/cx) sample was found to be had positive for h. influenza.
Upper extremity ultrasound of his left arm showed an extensive, canalized clot.
His INR has been stable at 2.2-2.3 on coumadin 5mg po qhs.
On [**2154-9-19**], he had a fever spike which was attributed to his pneumovax and flu vaccines given [**9-18**].
Chest x-ray at the time was clear and pan-culture (blood/urine/sputum as well as a wound culture) were sent.
Blood cultures were negative, wound culture was positive for coag negative staph, and sputum culture was positive for 2+ gram neg rods, 2+ gram + cocci.
For his quadraplegia, during a previous admission (on [**2154-8-26**]) the patient had a vertebral fusion of C1-C7 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] of Neurosurgery.

His bed was changed to a more advanced [**Doctor First Name **]-air bed that could also perform chest pt and repositioning.
Iron studies showed a mixed picture but his hematocrit remained stable 27-30% throughout his course here.
Speech and swallow evaluation determined he could swallow however, a PO diet was not given due to the amount of mechanical ventilation.
