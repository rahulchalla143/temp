[**2135-9-2**] - Cardiac Catheterization with placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.
History of Present Illness: 51 yo man with DM, HTN, LE claudication, presenting with worsening dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea for approximately 2 weeks, found to have elevated BNP and TropT 0.4 with CXR suggestive of pulmonary edema in ED, who developed worsening dyspnea after receiving contrast for CT to r/u PE.
Went to PCP after sx acutely worsened and was found to have low sats and sinus tach, for which he was sent to ED for PE work up.
In the ED, EKG wnl, trop 0.4, CXR showed pulmonary edema but he was persistently tachycardic so CT PE was done.

Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 18 mmHg and a PCWP of 35 mmHg.
The pulmonary pressures were elevated with a PASP of 62 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.6 l/min/m2.
The central aortic pressure was 125/90 mmHg.
An intraortic balloon pump was placed sheathed via the right femoral artery with diastolic augmentation from 72 to 110 mmHg, with a MAP of 90 mmHg on [**1-28**] counterpulsation.
[**2135-9-3**] ECHO The right atrium is dilated.
Ejection fraction of 15-20%.
Ejection fraction 15-20%.
Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2135-9-11**] 1:29 PM  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 51 year old man with cabg Final Report PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were compared to [**9-9**], [**2135**].
DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2618**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2619**]   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 9975**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2135-9-2**] for workup of his shortness of breath and chest discomfort.
He had evidence of pulmonary edema with elevated BNP at 2164 and TropT 0.4, most suggestive of acute heart failure likely secondary to recent ischemic event.
ECHO was done and demonstrated extensive left ventricular regional dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.
Mr. [**Known lastname 9975**] was taken for a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe left main and three vessel disease.
An IABP was placed and the cardiac surgical service was consulted.
On POD5 his sedation was stopped, he was weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
