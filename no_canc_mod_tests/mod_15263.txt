ERCP: Impression: ERCP with cholangiogram revealed 1cm stone in mid/distal CBD with upstream biliary dilation.
Because of the patient's critical illness, the decision was made not to attempt sphincterotomy/sphincteroplasty for stone extraction.
Cardiac enzymes were WNL.
Echo was performed and EF was found to be preserved.
