LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=45-50 %).
The remainder of the exam is unchanged.
his bypass time was 143 minutes with a crossclamp time of 76 minutes.
After extubation he remained in the ICU to monitor his cardiac rhythm as he had had episode of junctional rhythm and history of Atrial fibrillation, EP service was consulted.
The remainder of his hospital course was uneventful, his coumadin was resumed and on POD 6 his INR was therapeudic and he was discharged home with visiting nurse.
