Her last echocardiogram was on [**2124-8-11**] and showed PDA closed with good biventricular function and a patent foramen ovale.
Her stoma output seemed to improve with return to continuous feeds and then she transitioned to [**11-28**] volume orally with 1/2 volume by continuous gavage feeds with the ostomy output stable at approximately 2 mL per kilogram per hour.
A 25 vitamin D level was normal.
She has had persistent moderate hyperbilirubinemia with direct bilirubins to 4.4 which was the highest.
Her last pack red blood cell transfusion on [**2124-9-13**].

Hematology: Her blood type is A-positive.
Her most recent hematocrit which was on readmission is 33%.
Neurology: A head ultrasound on [**10-24**] showed a new left choroid plexus cystic region that could represent an evolving hemorrhage versus a multiseptated choroid plexus cyst.
