Along with this, he reports the sudden onset of chest pain, which he described a different from his angina.
Upon review of the [**Hospital1 **] records, ED EKG showed  2:1 a-flutter at a rate of 120 with RBBB.
He was given Acetaminophen for the fever, a chest xray was obtained which was reportedly non-diagnostic as was a U/A.
His labwork was notable for a Troponin T of 2.9, BNP 1070.
He was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
In the ED, initial vitals were T97, HR 97, BP 105/68, RR 14, Sat 98% on 2L.
His labwork was notable for a Troponin of 1.05, BUN/Cr 41/1.7, plts 140, Hgb 10.8, INR 1.4, PTT 37.4.
His blood pressure dropped to 87/56 after he received the morphine so he received a 500cc bolus with good BP response.
Portable CXR showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion with no effusions.
CPR was initiated but patient regained consciousness quickly.
SBP was 140, oxygen sats were in the mid-90s, HR was 80-90s.
On arrival to the CCU, patient's oxygen saturations were in the mid-high 80s on a NRB.
ABG showed that he was oxygenating well (7.39/38/314/24).

Studies: CXR [**12-28**] FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with mild cardiomegaly.
CT spine [**12-28**]: IMPRESSION: No cervical spine fracture.
Spondylotic abnormalities, and other findings, noted above.
MRI scanning is more sensitive than CT imaging in detecting cord injury from spondylosis/trauma, if clinically suspected.
CT head [**12-28**]: CONCLUSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
Cervical spine MRI [**12-29**]: IMPRESSIONS: 1.
Echo [**12-30**]: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Global left ventricular systolic function appears groslly preserved There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta and aortic arch.
Echo [**2167-1-5**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-8-12**], the LVEF has decreased.
If indicated, a cardiac MRI may more accurately assess LVEF.
EKG on admission [**12-28**]: Underlying atrial mechanism not certain with differential diagnosis including atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter variant versus atrial tachycardia with variable block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2165-8-16**] atrial tachy-arrhythmia is new.
EKG [**2167-1-5**]: Sinus rhythm.
His rate slowed, but he remained in a-fib.
# NSTEMI: Pt was first seen at [**Hospital3 4107**] with 2 days of chest pain and was noted to have a positive troponin-I of 2.92.
His troponin-T in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED was 1.05, prior troponins in [**2164**] ranged from 0.05->0.23 in the setting of his renal dysfunction.
His troponins remained elevated in the 1's but his CK decreased and his CK-MB were normal.
Pt had both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy which was only significant for antral erosisons but no obvious source of bleed.
After endoscopy, he had no further signs of bleeding and hct stable at 30-32.
#Acute on chronic systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  Pt with echo in-house showing worsening LVEF to 40% compared to prior echo.
He had pan cultures taken (blood, urine, sputum) and a chest x-ray was done, but no focal source was identified.
# Hypoxia: He was hypoxic to the the high 80's on NRB initially on transfer to the CCU, and was able to be weaned without intervention to 2L NC and maintained sats in the low to mid 90s.
Because of his normal ABG and his normal methemoglobin, as well as his downtrending CK-MBs he was thought to be overloaded.
Creatinine at baseline on arrival (1.7) and increased likely secondary to poor forward flow to as high as 2.3.
He was continued on home spironalactone, torsemide, and metolazone, and his Cr improved to 1.8 on [**Last Name (STitle) **] .
TSH was WNL.
