Admission Date:  [**2167-2-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-3-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2098-12-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU ROM  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for severe COPD, AFib, anxiety and depression, who was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2167-2-22**] to [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation of his COPD.
Specifically, the patient was admitted to the CT Surgery service for evaluation for potential lung volume reduction surgery.
The patient's primary pulmonologist at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55254**] and he referred the patient specifically to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**], a CT Surgery attending at [**Hospital3 **].
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course from [**2167-2-22**] up until [**2167-3-6**] has been dictated previously by a CT surgeon on Dr.[**Name (NI) 1816**] team.
While on the CT Surgery service, the patient was evaluated by multiple services, including Dermatology, Plastic Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Infectious Disease, Rheumatology, Pulmonary, Nutrition, and Physical Therapy.
He had pulmonary function testing on [**2-25**] that revealed a SVC of 2.98, which is 70% of predicted, a FEV1 of 0.96, which is 33% predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of 32, which is 47% predicted.
The patient had a CT of the chest with and without contrast on [**2167-2-24**] that showed no lymphadenopathy, extensive emphysematous changes bilaterally, and multiple small bilateral vague patchy areas of nodularity of uncertain significance.
An incidental finding was made of an infrarenal aortic stenosis and extensive vascular calcifications.
Because of this incidental finding, the patient had bilateral PVR testing that revealed significantly decreased flow to the right leg and a normal PVR of the left leg.
As far as further significant events during his CT Surgery hospital course, the patient was evaluated by Dermatology and had multiple biopsies of the skin ulcerations.
There was no evidence of a systemic vasculitis or rheumatologic issue based on multiple testing including negative [**Doctor First Name **], negative rheumatoid factor, negative ANCA, and negative RPR.
The reason antibiotics were started was that the patient had a leukocytosis with a peak white blood cell count of 28,000 while on the CT Surgery service team.
Serial ABGs showed a worsening hypercapnia.
His ABG on the evening of [**2167-3-8**] was 7.3, 60, and 80.
Was noted to be somnolent, and his ABG was 7.21 pH, 80 pCO2, and 80 O2.
The patient on examination was noted to have diffuse expiratory wheezes and was found to be in hypercapnic respiratory failure.
A trial of BiPAP was initiated as the patient had responded to this in the past.
After 15 minutes on BiPAP, repeat ABG was pH 7.19, pCO2 87, and pO2 had dropped to 52.
Repeat blood gas immediately after intubation was 7.23, pCO2 of 70, and pO2 of 367.
The vent was therefore changed to AC at 50% FIO2, 550 tidal volume by 20% respiratory rate with a repeat ABG of pH 7.32, pCO2 of 55, and pO2 of 101.
Of note, immediately after intubation, the patient was noted to become hypotensive with mean arterial pressures between 40 and 50 and required the use of Levophed as a pressor.
A chest x-ray was obtained post intubation that showed no evidence of infiltrate, no new pneumothoraces, and no obvious explanation for why the patient had a hypercapnic respiratory failure.
Baseline sats were 93% per outside hospital records.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM THE CT SURGERY SERVICE: 1.
Blood pressure was quite labile ranging from systolic blood pressure of 60-190/diagnostic of 40-100, pulse was 70-120 and was regular.
DATA ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit was 31.6, white count was 17.5 with 96% neutrophils and 0 bands.
INR is 0.8.
PTT 28, PT 11.
Platelet count was 413.
Chemistries:  Sodium 140, potassium 5, chloride 103, bicarb 28, BUN 43, creatinine 0.5, glucose 127, calcium 8.9, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 4.9.
Urine electrolytes were significant for a FENa of 0.1%.
Clostridium difficile was negative x2.
Blood cultures from admission and [**2167-2-28**] showed no growth to date.
EKG was normal sinus rhythm, rate 100, normal axis, prominent P waves.
These EKG changes were old.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with severe COPD initially admitted to the CT Surgery service on [**2167-2-22**] for evaluation for potential lung volume reduction surgery.
Initial chest x-ray on admission showed no evidence of pulmonary infiltrates, and no evidence of pneumothoraces.
A cardiac arrest code was called, and the patient went from asystole to a PEA arrest requiring Epinephrine and atropine dosing.
The patient then returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm in the 80s with a blood pressure that rose using multiple pressors.
In this setting, a repeat chest x-ray was obtained.
A needle decompression was performed and a chest tube was immediately placed by the Surgery service.
He was able to be weaned to CPAP with pressure support and on the day of discharge to the pulmonary rehab facility, he was requiring 0 PEEP and a pressure support of 8 with excellent oxygenation and no signs of hypercapnia.
Chest x-ray prior to admission showed no pneumothorax, no infiltrates.
The highest blood pressure was 150 systolic with a heart rate in the high 90s.
Thrombocytopenia:  When the patient was admitted, he had a reactive thrombocytosis most likely with platelets up to 600,000.
As the patient's platelet count continued to drop off of Heparin, Hematology consult was obtained.
The second test also returned negative as this is a highly sensitive test for Heparin dependent antibodies and the HIT syndrome, it was felt that he does not have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Therefore, once the patient's platelet count returned to within normal limits and showed upward trend, based on recommendations from the Hematology service, the patient was started on prophylaxis for further clots of Lovenox 30 subq b.i.d.
He tolerated this medication well and his platelets remained quite stable with a platelet count in he 300's upon discharge.
His aspirin was held while he was severely thrombocytopenic, but then reinitiated when his platelet count returned to [**Location 213**].
On both occasions, the patient failed the speech and swallow evaluation and was noted to aspirate thin liquids.
Even with his profound nutritional deficiency, his coags including INR were within normal limits.
Infectious disease:  The patient did have a leukocytosis as mentioned above with a peak white blood cell count of 28,000.
He remained afebrile with no evidence of pneumonia, no line infections, and his skin lesions did not become reinfected.
