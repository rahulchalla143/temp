No pronator drift  DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: Alert and oriented x3 continues to have some double vision CN 2-12 grossly intact Motor exam full throughout   Pertinent Results: CT/CTA HEAD [**3-16**]: C- head: Focal parenchymal hemorrhage originating from the posterior midbrain/pons and extending into the ventricular system, filling the 4th ventricle with mild dilatation of the lateral ventricles.
CT HEAD [**3-18**] 1.
______________________________________________________________  [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname **] [**Medical Record Number 17516**] M  36  [**2143-2-4**]  NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: As compared to the prior scan from [**3-18**], [**2179**], there has been increase in size of lateral ventricle and third ventricle compatible with mild-to-moderate hydrocephalus.
Head CT revealed an isolated third ventricle hemorrhage.
On [**3-17**], patient was takem for a diagnostic angiogram.
His exam was stable.
Repeat head CT was stable.
He remained stable until on [**2179-3-22**] he had a CT scan that showed hydrocephalus.
His subsequent imaging was stable, and he slowly began to accomidate his hydrocephalus and reached his baseline mental status and was transferred to the floor.
An MRI/MRA of the brain was also performed which showed no evidence of an underlying vascular lesion.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
You will need an angiogram at that time.
