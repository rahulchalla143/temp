[**Street Address(2) 7383**] depressions in V3, V4, Q waves in V1 and V2 and slightly prolonged QT interval.
She was painfree and transferred to [**Hospital6 2003**] for cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.8, blood pressure 107/55, heartrate 76 and regular, respiratory rate 16, saturations 88% on room air which went up to 100% on 10 liters via nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, no vision, right eye.
LABORATORY DATA:  Outside hospital data revealed creatinine kinase of 149, MB 4.7, index 3.2, troponin less than .3.
Blood sugar at an outside hospital 513, potassium 5.1, hematocrit 32.2, INR 1.0.
Last catheterization in [**2103-6-8**] showed diffuse disease with a 90% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery and diffuse disease in all other vessels with three vessel disease.
Echocardiogram at [**Hospital6 7373**] in [**2103-6-8**] showed an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%.
Data at our hospital four hours after the first set of enzymes at the outside hospital showed a creatinine kinase of 377, MB 44 and index of 11.7 and troponin had bumped to 37.8, hemoglobin A1c was pending.
Urinalysis showed 6 to 10 white cells, 3 to 5 red cells, negative nitrate, trace leukocyte esterase, bacteria many.
Electrocardiogram changes were consistent with occlusion at the mid distal right coronary artery, patient also presented with poorly controlled blood sugars.
Cardiac catheterization was planned for the morning of hospital day #2.
The patient was given Mucomyst over the evening of hospital day #1 and went for cardiac catheterization on [**2105-1-1**].
Comments on cardiac catheterization revealed severe three vessel disease.
Hemodynamics revealed a markedly elevated left-sided filling pressure with an left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 31 mm of mercury.
The patient's creatinine kinases were trended.
Her peak creatinine kinase was 1,112 with third creatinine kinase coming down to 692.
Her creatinine was stable immediately after cardiac catheterization at 1.9.
Her ACE was held after cardiac catheterization for renal protective reasons.
A Persantine MIBI was done which showed reversible perfusion defects in the apical inferior and septal walls of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 23% based on gated imaging.
With this amount of reversible defects it was decided that the patient should go to cardiac catheterization to have intervention on the occluded right coronary artery.
Therefore on [**4-6**], the patient went for cardiac catheterization.
She had an echocardiogram on [**2105-1-2**] that showed the left atrium elongated.
Right ventricular size was normal, 1+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, no pericardial effusion.
Her Metoprolol was at 12.5 p.o.
Hemoglobin A1c was checked on [**2104-12-31**] which came back at 7.0 indicating relatively good control of her blood sugars.
Based on the patient's hemoglobin A1c she had relatively good glucose control at home on her prior regimen, therefore she was discharged on her prior regimen of NPH 20 q.
The urine culture grew out Klebsiella which was sensitive to Levofloxacin and therefore the patient was continued on Ciprofloxacin for a five day course.
