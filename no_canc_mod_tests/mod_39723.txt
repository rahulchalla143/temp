TTE [**2126-11-2**] Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
CXR [**2126-11-2**] FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study the right hilum remains prominent and the study is in a more lordotic position.
CXR [**2126-11-4**]  FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged right mediastinal widening and increased diameter of the pulmonary arteries.
ECG [**2126-11-3**]  11:27:52 AM  Sinus tachycardia Low amplitude inferior T wave chnages are nonspecific and may be within normal limits Since previous tracing of [**2126-11-2**], sinus tachycardia rate faster, and T wave changes decreased    Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 117 174 72 306/405 43 -3 -13    Brief Hospital Course: 60F with bilateral extensive pulmonary emboli.
