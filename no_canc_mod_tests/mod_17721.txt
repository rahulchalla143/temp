ECHO [**2131-11-14**]: The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-11-12**], the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are now reduced.
ECHO [**2131-11-27**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-11-14**], left ventricular systolic function appears markedly improved (consistent with possible stress induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy).

CT HEAD [**11-30**]: No evidence of hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarction.
CT C-SPINE [**11-27**]: Limited study due to patient motion.
Mild anterolisthesis of C4 over C5.
If there is high clinical suspicion for cervical spine fracture consider a repeat cervical spine CT scan.
EKG: [**2131-11-15**] Atrial fibrillation with mean ventricular rate 111.
Compared to previous tracing of [**2131-11-14**] multiple abnormalities persist without major change.
[**2131-12-3**]: Atrial fibrillation, mean ventricular rate 95.

Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial  hypotension of 85/43 mm Hg.
Left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated with LVEDp of 20 mm Hg.
Distal aortagram revealed diffuse atherosclerotic disease of bilateral aortoiliac systems, with complete occlusion of the right iliac artery.
Further evaluation with dedicated MR examination is recommended if patient can tolerate.
Otherwise, non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT examination can be considered.
[**2131-12-15**] Chest CT 1.
1 cm right lower lobe pulmonary artery aneurysm seen on the [**2131-12-2**] study is not well evaluated on this study.
Shortly after admission to OSH, her WBC increased to 22, creatinine increased from .8 to 2.1, and troponins increased from .1 to 2.53.
UA demonstrated 10-25 WBCs with 2+ bacteria and she was started on levofloxacin.
Additionally, an echo demonstrated EF 20%, akinesis except base and inferior-lateral wall.
Her initial echo demonstrated a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
She also underwent catheterization which demonstrated clean coronaries.
She had a moderate diuresis with improvement in both her blood pressures and her creatinine.
Her vital signs have remained stable.
The patient's hospitalization was further complicated by a fall for which she had head imaging that was not concerning for an acute bleed.
A chest x-ray showed a question of a consolidation and she was started on treatment for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia.
OTHER ISSUES DURING ADMISSION -Apical Thrombus Her echo on admission demonstrated a possible apical thrombus and she was maintained on anticoagulation for this (in addition to her atrial fibrillation) - E.coli UTI and possible pyelo - she was started levofloxacin on [**2131-11-12**] for an E.coli UTI and then transitioned to cipro.
Initial nutrition assessment on [**11-15**] recommended NGT with tube feeds, supplements, and a bedside speech and swallow on [**11-15**] demonstrated no aspiration but concerns of stricture causing her poor intake.
Her creatinine improved steadily with diuresis, making pre-renal renal failure secondary to poor forward flow most likely.
- s/p fall and hypotension - On [**2131-11-27**], she triggered after she fell and also for hypotension with SBP in the 80s.
An echo that day demonstrated elevated PA pressure concerning for PE.
CTA chest was negative for PE.
She was on Dopamine drip on arrival with systolic pressures in the mid 90s and heart rate in the 70s.
A swan-ganz catheter was placed and showed a wedge of 32 and a PA systolic in the low 50s.
Cardiac index was below 2.0 initially.
She was switched to Dobutamine and initial index was 2.04 and a SVR of 1300.
Index rose to 2.9 and a SVR in the 800s on 4mcg of dobutamine.
Echocardiography showed a decresed ejection fraction (30%) with distal akinesis of LV and RV.
Cath was deferred initially due to increasing WBC count and flank pain concerning for possible pyelonephritis.
Renal USD was obtained that showed no evidence of perinephric abscess, stones or hydronephrosis.
Patient remained afebrile, and cardiac cath was performed on [**11-21**] demonstrating peripheral arterial disease without significant coronary disesase, she developed a brachial artery thrombus post procedure and required surgical exploration and successful removal of thrombus from the brachial artery.
Her initial two echocardiograms revealed a depressed LVEF and a Takatsubo pattern to her contractility, this resolved, also consitent with this entity.
Treatment with mucomyst, albuterol, and chest PT greatly improved her lung aeration.
CXR prior to discharge showed persistent bilateral effusions.
GU/Renal:  Patient initially with UTI (E-coli which was pan-sensitive), treated with Levofloxacin, treatment complete, follow up urine cultures neagtive.
Creatinine increased to 2.3 upon admission, likely ATN, cardiogenic shock possibly post cath and contrast nephropathy in the setting of heart failure, with improvement of heart failure her renal function improved.
Renal USD demonstrated a probable angiomyolipoma and radiology recommneded rec'd CT abdomen or MRI for further evaluation, she should have this as a follow up as an outpatient in the future.
Mental status: the patient had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status for the majority of her stay, she would become delerious (disoriented and somnolent) without any clear cause, toxic / metabolic causes were ruled out and appropriate head imaging was performed with no yield.
If she is able to abstain from alcohol for several months at home, the geriatrics service reccommended cognitive/memory evaluation as an outpatient at a later date.
Given her [**Hospital 5610**] hospital stay, her CXR appearing and her clinical status, she will be treated for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn for a 7 day course.

Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension [**Hospital1 **]: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
Secondary Diangosis: ETOH abuse   Discharge Condition: Stable, working with physical therapy and breathing room air   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a low blood pressure and decreased functioning of your heart.
During your stay you had times during which you became somnolent and difficult to arouse, you underwent a very thorough workup that did not yield any positive results.
