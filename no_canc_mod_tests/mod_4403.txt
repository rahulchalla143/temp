IMAGING: [**2196-5-18**] Bone Scan: Whole body images of the skeleton obtained in anterior and posterior projections show no abnormal focal increased or decreased tracer uptake.
[**2196-5-18**] CT Chest: A 9-mm left lower lobe nodule demonstrates heterogeneous attenuation and a somewhat lobular contour (4:198).
This study is not optimized for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures, but within this limitation, no acute abnormalities are detected.
Upper abdominal varices are better seen on prior abdominal MR. A calcified gallstone is seen in the region of the gallbladder neck.
9-mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, chronicity difficult to determine since this lesion is located at the margin of included lung fields from prior CT abdomen ([**2194-2-14**] and [**Month (only) **] [**2188**]), but likely new.
NG lavage showed pink fluid that did not clear.
Patient underwent EGD on [**5-19**].
Subsequently, Hct was stable, and patient was asymptomatic (dyspnea resolved).
At the time of discharge, Hct was 26.1.
Patient will have CBC checked on Monday [**5-23**].
There were no acute ischemic changes on EKG or CT scan.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Patient to have CBC checked on Monday [**5-23**] to monitor anemia.
# Pulmonary nodule was noted incidentally on CT scan.
This should be followed up in 3 months with a CT scan.
Outpatient Lab Work Have CBC checked on Monday [**5-23**].
Please have your labs checked on Monday [**2196-5-23**], with results sent to Drs.
