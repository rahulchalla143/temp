Necrotizing fasciitis - Fournier's gangrene - status post debridement times three.
Necrotizing fasciitis - Fournier's gangrene - status post exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions, repair of ventral/umbilical hernia, sigmoid colostomy, status post open gastrostomy tube placement, status post feeding jejunostomy tube placement, status post rigid sigmoidoscopy, status post necrotic tissue debridement.
When she was seen and examined at the outside hospital she underwent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis which showed soft tissue air bilaterally extending around the rectum and into the retroperitoneal tissue.
She remained intubated postoperatively after this and a repeat CT scan on the 23rd showed persistent peritoneal gas; therefore, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
When she arrived at [**Hospital1 69**] her T-max was 100.1 degrees; otherwise, patient was intubated and her heart rate was in the 70's to 80's with a systolic pressure from the 100's to 140's and, as noted, patient was intubated.
She had a chest x-ray also from that outside hospital which did not evidence any infiltrate and the CT scan findings as noted above.
ADMISSION LABORATORY:  When she arrived her white count was 23.1 with an hematocrit of 33.
Otherwise, her electrolytes were notable for potassium of 4.7, BUN and creatinine of 15 and 0.7.
As noted on [**2139-3-17**], patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions.
A ventral and umbilical hernia were found which were both reduced and repaired primarily and sigmoid colostomy was created.
On examination there were only a few crackles at the bases indicating these had essentially resolved.
From a cardiac standpoint, there was a question of whether patient had suffered any sort of ischemic event while at the outside hospital as noted by troponin-I of 0.6 but there were no electrocardiogram changes and an echocardiogram there showed preserved left ventricular systolic function.
which allowed her to maintain rate at around 70 with pressures of 130's over 70's.
From a renal standpoint, as noted, patient's creatinine when she came in was about 0.7.
Prior to discharge her BUN and creatinine were around their baseline at 13 and 0.9.
Subsequent to this patient's hematocrit was actually pretty stable and prior to discharge was 29.3.
She had always ranged between about 27 and 29 during her hospitalization except as noted when she came in when her hematocrit was between 30 and 33 which was felt partially to be secondary to dehydration.
These intraoperative cultures from our institution showed notable growth of Bacteroides fragilis, Gram positive rods, horny bacterium, Staphylococcus which was coag negative and Gram negative rods.
During the course of her hospitalization only one blood culture bottle grew coag negative Staph and all other blood cultures were otherwise negative.
Her Clostridium difficile's were negative and urine cultures never evidenced any sort of urinary tract infection.
There was question as to whether a Vac would be appropriate for the patient but after extensive consultation with Plastic Surgery, their recommendation was to continue with wet-to-dry dressing changes.
FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was advised to return to her surgeon or call her surgeon's office for a temperature above 101.5 degrees, any worsening drainage from the wound or increasing redness of the wound.
