CXR ([**5-13**]): Increasing alveolar air space opacities most likely representing aspiration.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are  normal.
She was given NAC infusion uneil her INR was below 2.
Her LFTs, HCT, and coagulation studies were checked q 4 hours.
She was given FFP for an INR of 12.
As these trended [**Last Name (un) 8636**], her total bilirubin begain to rise and she developed asterixs.
Of note, the patient underwent a liver bx at [**Hospital1 2025**] (records in chart) in [**2185**] which showed chronic hep C without cirrhosis.
Full Hep panel revealed that she has Ab to HepBc and HepBs as well as HAV Ab.
Hep B VL was pending at discharge and may be followed-up on an outpatient basis.
There was high suspicion for ketoacidosis given she has been down for an unknown period of time, but urine ketones negative.
Her lactate, however, was 12.5, so likely all [**1-28**] lactic acidosis from hypotension, low tissue perfusion, and less likely sepsis.
Her gap closed as her renal function improved.
# GI bleed-At the OSH, the patient reportdely had 500cc of coffee ground emesis from her NGT once it was placed.
Her HCT decreased here from 41 to 26, but this was likely from the massive fluid recusatiaion she recieved.
She should have an outpatient EGD in [**4-1**] weeks for further evaluation.
# Anemia: The paitent likley has a baseline anemia, exacerbated by her renal and liver failure and her recent bleed.
Her HCT on discharge was 35. .
Head CT showed no bleed.
EEG revealed diffuse encephalopathy.
This was likely multifactorial, related to her liver failure, renal failure, baseline medical issues, and medications she was receiving.
#Aspiration PNA: Pt had a low-grade temp to 100.1 and CXR showed upper airway consolidation.
She should have a follow-up CXR in [**4-1**] weeks to document clearance.
