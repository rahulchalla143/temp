Labs at BIDN were significant for WBC 25.5, Cr 1.8 and UA with 50-100 WBCs, troponin < 0.01, LFT 34/19/94/1.09, guiaic neg.
BPs were in systolics 70s; RIJ CVL was placed and she was started on a neosynephrine drip at 1mcg/kg/min (of note, line had to be pulled back as it was initially in the R atrium).
Labs here notable for WBC 26.8 (no bands), Cr 1.1 and lactate 1.2.
INR subtherapeutic at 1.2.
VS on transfer were BP 123/71 HR 116, RR 19 98% RA, temp 98.9 (oral) and phenylephrine gtt at 1mcg/kg/min.

CT Abdomen and pelvis [**11-3**]: Preliminary Report !!
Renal Ultrasound [**11-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**Month/Year (2) **]-to-severe hydronephrosis of the left kidney of unclear origin.
An MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is recommended for further evaluation.
Her CXR also showed a patchy opacity in RUL on CXR and ground glass opacity on LLL.
Upon arrival, her labs were notable for WBC 26.8 (no bands) and a repeat UA showed a UTI.
An ECHO was obtained which showed "EF of 40%, [**Month/Year (2) 1192**] MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] TR, Right ventricle pressure overload with septal flattening" and other findings as above.
Her urine culture grew out pansensitive E.coli which was covered by ceftriaxone.
Her BP was maintained with MAPs in 70s.
Renal US showed [**Month/Year (2) 1192**] to severe hydronephrosis on the left side, confirmed by CT abdomen and pelvis.
She received a TTE, the results of which showed an EF of 40%.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Per OSH report, pt had Cr of 1.8, which downtrended to 1.1 after 4 liter fluid resuscitation.
Transitional Issues:  -Pt will be transferred to a rehab facilty  -Pt will need to follow up with her PCP one to two weeks after discharge from rehab  -Pt will follow up with urology to monitor her left hydronephrosis and ensure that there is no further treatment needed  -Pt should have her WBC checked at next PCP appointment to see if it has normalized or fallen to her baseline level.
