His systolic blood pressure was noted to be in the 80s by EMS and he was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he continued to be bradycardic to the 50s and hypotensive with SBP in 70s and received 3L of NS via a right IJ central venous access with modest improvement in blood pressure to SBP in 90s.
Cardiac enzymes were not elevated.
He subsequently converted to sinus rhythm and his blood pressure further improved with SBP in the 110s.
On transfer the vital signs were 97.3 57 102/65 16 98% 1L NC    On initial evaluation in the CCU, his vital signs were 60 112/68 SpO2 100% on RA.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - CABG:  CAD s/p CABG x 5 in [**11-18**] LIMA-LAD, SVG-Diag, SVG-OM1, SVG-OM2, SVG-RCA 3.

CXR AP [**2139-7-17**] (S/p line placement: FINDINGS: There is a new right IJ line with the tip in the lower SVC.
TTE [**2139-7-18**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Foal distal septal/apical septal hypokinesis is suggested with overall left ventricular ejection fraction preserved (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-11-20**], no change.
If indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast may better [**Year (4 digits) 11197**] distal LV/apical function.
Evaluation of EKG in ED revealed AV dissociation.
Cardiac enzymes were reassuring for no acute ischemia.
Lyme titers were pending at time of discharge.
On discharge EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with AV conduction delay.
EKG and cardiac enzymes showed no e/o active ischemia.
Blood pressure improved significantly after conversion to NSR.
