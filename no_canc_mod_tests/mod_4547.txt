Her SBP was in the 200s.
Head CT was done which showed no acute intracranial process and neurology ruled out seizures and cooling was not needed.
Post-defib EKGs with normal sinus rhythm was neg for ischemia and echo was nl.
Also, she continued to be hypertensive w/ SBPs in the 200s post arrest on 80mcg of propofol with other notable lab values being K 5.3, INR 3.6, Lactate 5.0.
She was then transfered to the MICU on ventilation with the settings: 100% 400 x 18 PEEP 5. .
She was bolused 1L and SBP rose to >190-200.

Her SBP was in the 200s.
Head CT was done which showed no acute intracranial process and neurology ruled out seizures and cooling was not needed.
Post-defib EKGs with normal sinus rhythm was negative for ischemia and echocardiogram was normal.
She was given 2g Magnesium and cardiology thought her ventricular fibrillation arrest was a primary arrythmatic event (prolonged QTc) secondary to dofetilide rather than ischemia.
An electrophysiology consultation was obtained, resulting in the decision to initiate amiodarone.
On the floor, her respiratory status continued to improve with oxygyen (for a day) until she breathing room air with normal lung exam for the rest of the hospital course.
Her sputum cultures have grown MSSA.
Her urine showed hyaline casts but no wbc or rbc.
FEUrea on [**5-8**] was 24%.
Her urine eosinophils were negative.
Her Creatinine improved to baseline of [**1-8**].3 at discharge from the MICU.
Her INR initially was supratherapeutic with a peak of 6.8 likely secondary to nutritional deficiency.
She received oral vitamin K. She was then restarted on coumadin and had an INR of 1.5 at discharge.
Her goal INR is [**1-9**].
#HYPERTENSION: On admission, patient was very hypertensive with SBP > 200.
Because she was bardycardic, there was initial concern for ruptured aneurysm/subarachnoid bleed,; however, head CT, head CTA, and MRI were all negative.
Her metoprolol was changed to Labetolol 200mg TID and then Labetolol 400mg [**Hospital1 **] on discharge to keep the BP within goal of <140 SBP.
Calcium 600 with Vitamin D3 600 mg(1,500mg) -200 unit Tablet  Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
Calcium 500 500 mg (1,250 mg) Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO  three times a day.
Over the hospital course, your blood pressure also went high with systolic blood pressures in the 200 (goal blood pressure is systolic <140).
Your blood pressure medications were changed and your blood pressure control improved.
