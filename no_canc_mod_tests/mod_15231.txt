At hemodialysis the patient was found to have a increased white blood cell count of 17 and temperature of approximately 101.
He was transferred from his outpatient dialysis unit to transplant surgery team at [**Hospital6 256**] for evaluation of his arteriovenous graft.
During the month prior to admission the patient had positive cultures from his catheter at his hemodialysis for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The blood cultures will mostly be drawn from the left upper extremity arteriovenous graft.
Blood cultures were drawn and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed.
The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a 2 by 1.2 cm pedunculated vegetation on the atrial side of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with moderate points for regurgitation and a mild stream of mitral regurgitation at the leaflet base indicating a small perforation.
Maternal grandfather had a nephrectomy of unknown reasons.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  P  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Significant for a temperature of 101.6, systolic blood pressures 94 to 120s, pulse 115 to 150s, respirations in the 30s, 99% on 3 liters, 262 pounds, morbidly obese male in moderate respiratory distress.
Lungs clear to auscultation but distant lung sounds.
Urinalysis, large blood, 30 protein, 100 glucose, trace leukocytes, 0-2 red blood cells, [**4-30**] white blood cells, [**4-30**] epithelial cells, occasional bacteria.
Chest x-ray with low lung volume, cardiomegaly but no fluid seen.
Transesophageal echocardiogram and ultrasound of the left upper extremity was noted in the history of present illness.
Sodium 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 96, bicarbonate 20, BUN 59, creatinine 7.4, glucose 188, anion gap of 23, calcium 8.7, phosphorus 3.9, magnesium 1.8, albumin 3.1, white count 16.0, hematocrit 31, liver function tests within normal limits.
CPK 27, troponin T 0.28, INR of 4.1.
Endocarditis - The patient was found to have large vegetation on transesophageal echocardiogram on admission to the hospital.
Sensitivities from his Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates from the outside hospital were sensitive to Ampicillin and Penicillin, however, initial isolates from [**Hospital6 256**] were resistant.
The patient initially presented with a high white count of 16 which increased dramatically while on the Linezolid.
Since starting Penicillin his white count has been trending downward.
He had a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram that showed an interval decrease in the size of the posterior mitral valve defect vegetation.
Besides the patient's two transesophageal echocardiograms, he did have a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 60 to 65%, and a moderately dilated left atrium.
On physical examination the patient had splinter hemorrhaging from his finger nailbeds.
A abdominal computerized tomography scan done during hospitalization showed small probable infarct of the spleen.
Initially the patient had multiple cultures positive for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bacteremia.
These medications aided in good rate control and heart rate way below 100.
Fluid balance was maintained with hemodialysis, fluid restriction and strict ins and outs.
The patient thinks that he may have had a kidney biopsy in the past but is not sure.
In addition the patient received multiple units of packed red blood cells during admission to help with his blood volume.
This may have been a reservoir for blood accumulation, however, the hematoma remained stable once the patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit.
At that time a computerized tomography scan of his head was performed that showed a small subdural hematoma.
A computerized tomographic angiogram was unable to determine if a source of the hemorrhage may have been a mycotic aneurysm.
A repeat computerized tomography scan did not show any change in the size of the hemorrhage.
A computerized tomography scan of the head was done which showed atrophy but no new infarct.
Electroencephalogram was done that did not show seizure activity.
Rectal examination revealed poor sphincter tone.
The patient was unable to sit in the [**Hospital6 1760**] magnetic resonance imaging scan machine and therefore I would suggest a computerized tomography scan which is a test of lesser value.
The patient was transported to [**Hospital6 **] Hospital for an magnetic resonance imaging scan of his spine because they have a broader-based magnetic resonance imaging scan machine there.
Due to back up and the patient's asterixes he was unable to sit still for the magnetic resonance imaging scan.
However, the patient remained with myoclonus and severe asterixes which would have diminished the value of the magnetic resonance imaging scan in evaluating for an abscess and spinal cord compression.
Increasing white count - The patient's had increasing white count after about one week of intravenous Penicillin.
Initially after starting Penicillin the white count decreased and then started to rise again.
A Clostridium difficile culture was positive for Clostridium difficile and the patient was placed on Flagyl.
Patient came in with increased INR - Over the first couple of days of hospitalization the patient's INR increased and therefore the patient was given Vitamin K with a good response.
Hyperphosphatemia - The patient had a high phosphate level during hospitalization.
He was treated for five days of aluminum hydroxide and his phosphate level dropped down below 5.0.
