CT C spine [**2112-12-30**] No acute traumtic injury.
CT head [**2112-12-30**] Small amount of right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MRI head 2/2.08 1.
CT abdomen [**2112-12-31**] 1.
ECHO [**12-31**]/-08 The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to cooperate.
IMPRESSION: dilated, severely hypocontractile right ventricle; moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension   Brief Hospital Course: In the ED the patients vitals were Tmax 99.8, HR 70-77, BP SBP (82-119)/(43-84), RR 28-40, Sat 88% on 4L, then 100% on Non-rebreather.
He received 5 Liters of NS, levofloxacin 750mg x1, ceftriaxone 1gm x1, flagyl 500mg IV x 1, and 8 units of regular insulin.
Finger stick prior to CT scan was 401.
He had a head CT which was questionable for a small SAH.
Unable to send pt for repeat head CT as he did received contrast for his CT chest.
At time of admission still discussing final decision and further head imaging for patient.
Chronic, noted to have CT read of head w/ debate of artifact vs. SAH, found to have massive pulmonary embolus on CT scan.
# Saddle Pulmonary Embolus: Pt had massive pulmonary embolism, that has lead to ms changes, LOC, hypoxia, hypotension, elevated lactate, leukocytosis, and likely stress response causing glucose elevation.
Unable to repeat head CT, because CT chest dye load would interfere with ability to tell if SAH occurred.
head imaging showed bleed (confirmed by MRI), no heparin, placed IVC filter pending consensus no head bleed, planned to give intra-pulm cath thrombolytics becaue the benefit of lytics likely outweighs risk at this point in time.
Initially felt to be secondary to metabolic or infectious etiology given finding concerning for DKA (glucose 500s, ketones in urine, AG=17) and Sepsis(leukocytosis 18, elevated lactate 5.8, hypotension, desat).
# Anion Gap Acidosis: ph 7.39, Lactate is 5.3.
No abd signs of infection on exam or CT. Pt received levoquin 750 IV, flagyl 800mg IV, and ceftriaxone 1gm in ED.
First Trop 0.02, CK 207, MB 8 .
