He then became hypotensive to 83/53- his BP on presentation was 180/70 and tachy to 122.
CT abdomen showed possible stranding around pancreatic head.
An MRI of the spine without gadolinium was inconclusive and so on day of call-out to floor an MRI with gad was still pending to evaluate for T10 osteomyelitis.

CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
This needs clinical correlation as well as repeat MRI of the thoracic spine with IV contrast.
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through the thoracic spine.
FINDINGS:  As noted on the prior examination of [**2177-3-16**], there is increased T2 signal within the T9-10 disc as well as increased T2 signal within the superior endplate of T10.
Unlike on the prior study, today's exam demonstrates that the increased T2 signal within T9-10 disc level is not any different than the T2 signal within the T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1 disc spaces.
A followup exam could be obtained if clinically warranted as the possibility of a discitis and osteomyelitis remains.

Blood cultures were positive for Staph aureus, which was found to be sensitive to oxacillin.
However, other sources were sought: a panarex of the jaw revealed no areas suspicious for infection and TTE and TEE revealed no vegetations either as a cause or a result of the bacteremia.
An MR was done of the spine (workup detailed below).
The patient quickly stabalized his blood pressure and was transferred to the floor.
After his initial presentation, he remained afebrile, his repeat blood cultures were negative, and his WBC trended downward.
An MR without contrast was scheduled initially, which found increased signal intensity in the T9-10 disc and T10 vertebral superior endplate which were somewhat suspicious for infection, given the patient's presentation.
This was followed up with an MRI with gadolinium contrast, which again found T9-10 disc enhancement, but found an equal amount of enhancement in the T11-12 an T12-L1 disc spaces.
However, the study could not entirely rule out the possibility of infection.
The orthospine team was consulted and they offered the patient the option of doing a needle biopsy to rule out the chance of infection completely.
In addition, he was scheduled for a repeat MRI in 4 weeks time, to be done before his 4 week ID appointment.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] the strong indication of the imaging findings that the patient has had a compression fracture, the patient is likely at risk for repeated compression fractures.
Renal failure: While in the ICU the patient had an increase in his creatinine to a peak of 2.4.
On discharge his creatinine was at his baseline range of 1.1. .
On the general [**Hospital1 **], it was difficult to control his blood pressure.
He was instructed to follow his blood pressure closely over the next week with his primary care physician.
On the day after the central line was replaced and the labs were drawn off the PICC, his platelets rebounded to 131.
Follow-up: Followup with Infectious Disease as described above, with infusion therapy team and weekly labs, with MRI in 4 weeks, and with primary care physician.

In addition, they will monitor some laboratory levels for you, including your CBC with differential, BUN, Creatinine and Liver function tests.
If you notice blood sugars greater than 200, please call your primary care doctor.
You are planning to have your blood pressure closely monitored by your primary care physician after discharge.
