Compared to the previous tracing of [**2144-12-30**] no diagnostic change.
EGD ([**2145-2-10**]): Large hiatal hernia.
INR was supratheraputic at [**Location (un) 620**] and reversed with FFP and Vitamin K. The patient received two units of packed red blood cells, and his hematocrit responded appropriately.
Over the course of the next day, his hematocrit remained stable.
The patient's triple anticoagulation of aspirin, Coumadin, and Plavix was held, but metoprolol was restarted once blood pressures were likely to remain stable.
Pt then underwent EGD on [**2145-2-10**] which revealed hiatal hernia, antral gastritis, and ischemic damage to esophageal mucosa with sloughing.
By transfer from ICU, creatinine was 1.1, so no further work-up pursued.
Liver function tests were within normal limits.
CXR if worsening oxygenation or increased respiratory symptoms.
Pt noted, however, that he has stopped taking [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this medication was discontinued.
