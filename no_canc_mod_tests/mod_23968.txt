EEG [**2150-6-28**] IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured three clinical and electrographic seizures.
The background was slow and disorganized throughout much of the day's recording, suggestive of an encephalopathy, and rhythmic runs of frontal delta activity were seen intermittently lasting up to 10 seconds at a time.
EEG [**2150-6-29**] IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured four electrographic seizures, each lasting 30 seconds or more, that had no apparent clinical correlate.
Compared to the prior day's recording, the number of electrographic seizures remained about the same, although they were subclinical on this day's recording without associated upper extremity trembling as had been seen on the previous day.
The shorter bursts of interictal epileptiform activity were also more prominent on today's recording  EEG [**2150-6-30**] IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
EEG [**2150-7-1**] IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured two types of epileptiform activity both with a bifrontal predominance and both manifest as runs of activity that lasted up to 10 or 20 seconds typically without associated clinical accompaniment.
Compared to the prior day's recording, this day's recording was improved.
EEG [**2150-7-2**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to electrographic seizures characterized by low voltage rhythmic beta activity for five to ten seconds' duration.
The interictal EEG is notable for a slow background consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy as well as generalized spike and slow wave discharges with bifrontal predominance at times and, at other times, more monomorphic generalized delta  activity in brief runs.
EEG [**2150-7-3**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to a slow background consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
This study captured 25 pushbutton activations for various behaviors including hand wringing, clapping, groaning, facial movements that did not have an obvious electrographic correlate.
EEG [**2150-7-4**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to slowing of the background rhythm consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
EEG [**2150-7-5**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to brief electrographic seizures, as mentioned above.
EEG [**2150-7-6**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal extended routine recording for electrographic seizures lasting up to 25 seconds, rhythmic sharp  activity seen independently in the right and left temporal areas, interictal bursts of spikes and polyspikes in a generalized distribution, bursts of rhythmic delta slowing and a suppressed background.
CT head IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
CXR [**2150-7-8**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing bilateral areas of focal parenchymal opacities are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2427**] was admitted to neurology ICU service for evaluation and treatment of increasing frequency of seizures.
The EEG monitering showed improvement in the frequency of seizures, from nearly 20 or so in 24 hrs to [**3-26**] in 24 hrs, and from clinical seizures to subclinical seizures.
The cultures were sent and he was started on broad spectrum cover for nosocomial bacteria with vancomycin, zosyn and cipro.
After sputum grew E Coli - sensitive to zosyn, the other 2 antibiotics were stopped.
A suspicion of drug-related fever and rash were raised and the patient's dilantin and zosyn were discontinued.
