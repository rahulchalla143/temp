An echocardiogram at an outside hospital showed new dilated cardiomyopathy.
At the beginning of [**Month (only) **] he saw his primary care physician who felt he was having an asthma exacerbation and gave him intravenous Solu-Medrol, and the patient relayed a vague story of going into sinus tachycardia with a heart rate in the 120s, a fingerstick in the 500s, been sent to the Emergency Department and admitted to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital.
A chest x-ray showed a question of a left upper lobe pneumonia.
An echocardiogram during that admission showed global hypokinesis, 4-chamber dilatation, an ejection fraction of 10% to 15%.
His blood pressure previously had been 130s to 190s; he would take it at work.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Pulse of 114, blood pressure of 122/88, 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat showed extraocular muscles were intact.
Lungs were clear to auscultation without crackles; however, decreased air movement was noted bilaterally.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count of 9.7, hematocrit of 39, mean cell volume of 88, platelets of 251.
Blood urea nitrogen of 16, creatinine of 0.8, glucose of 168.
AST of 79, ALT of 340, thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.9, alkaline phosphatase of 186, albumin of 3.2, total bilirubin of 1.2.
Transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside hospital on [**7-6**] showed dilated left atrium of 5.6 cm, dilated left ventricle with severe global hypokinesis, ejection fraction of 10% to 15%, moderate mitral regurgitation, dilated right ventricle with moderate global dysfunction, mild tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary artery pressure in the 30s.
He was sent to the catheterization laboratory which revealed a middle left anterior descending artery lesion of 80%, status post stent.
His pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 35 mmHg to 40 mmHg.
His cardiac index was 1.4 L/kg/min/m2.
