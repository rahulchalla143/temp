Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent placed in left circumflex.
He paused, considering that this might be an AMI, decided not to work on another tree, collected his things, walked over the road to his house and called 911.
Opening blood pressure was 124 mmHg systolic, but decreased by the end of the procedure to 80s systolic.
NECK: Supple with JVP unable to be assessed - lying flat.

BRIEF HISTORY: 52 year old man with hypertension presented with chest pain, nausea/vomiting and ventricular fibrillation to an outside hospital.
The V fib was successfully cardioverted, and an ECG was consistent with inferoposterior STEMI.
He was transferred emergently to the [**Hospital1 18**] cardiac catheterization lab for right and left heart cath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections using a 5 French JL3.5 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast injections.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.

A 6F XB3.5 guide provided good support.
Post-dilation was performed with 3.25x15mm and 3.5x15mm Quantum Maverick balloons at 21 and 20atm, respectively.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, TIMI 3 flow, and no apparent dissection.
Arterial time = 1 hour 12 minutes.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP 16mmHg, and mean PCWP 25mmHg.
Because of low blood pressure in the presence of rapid atrial  fibrillation, cardioversion to NSR was performed with a single shock of 360 joules after the patient was sedated with the help of a member of the anesthesia department.

Coronary Artery Disease   The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and LCx disease and had a stent placed to the LCx.
Symptomatic ischemia and EKG changes were likely derived from the occluded LCx.
LDL 121 and HbA1c 5.4 suggesting he does not have diabetes.
The ventricular ectopy decreased, and after discussion with EP, low dose metoprolol was initiated and amidarone was stopped.
Hypertension/Hypotension   Balloon pump was used for the first 24 hours to support cardiac function and blood pressure.
Systolic blood pressures were initially in the 80s, lower during VT, even after having 4.5L of fluid.
Supported by diff with minimal bands and evening cortisol of 26 at presentation.
Your echocardiogram showed some wall motion abnormalities and your heart function is not as strong as it was before but we think this will improve over time.
Start taking Atorvastain to keep your cholesterol down 5.
Start taking Metoprolol to keep your heart rate low 6.
Start taking Lisinopril to keep your blood pressure low.
