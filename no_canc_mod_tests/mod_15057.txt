Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The patient had a white count of 22.1 which prompted a chest x-ray showing bilateral pleural effusion and patchy bibasilar atelectasis but no focal infiltrates.
An EKG was performed which showed atrial fibrillation but no ischemic changes.
A baseline arterial blood gas was obtained at that point which was 7.37/47/86/28/zero, again on 70% face mask.
Upon stimulation, he was tachycardic to the 110s with a blood pressure 130/70.
Cardiac consultation at that time recommended aspirin, cycling enzymes and agreed with probable aspiration event.
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a troponin of 26.5.
To evaluate possible neurologic injury, a CT scan was obtained after the patient was felt to be stable enough to be transferred.
On postoperative day six, the CT scan showed no acute intracranial event but was consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.
A repeat EEG was obtained on postoperative day number 10 and again showed moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy with no seizure focus.
A Neurology consultation was obtained and assessed the patient to have minimal chance for a meaningful recovery.
