Initial Glu 100, but 50 on repeat for which she recieved IV D50% 50cc.
EKG showed new T-wave inversions in the inferior leads Trop = 0.08 X1 WBC 3.8, Hct 26, PLT 105 all at recent baseline, cr/BUN 2.3/70 at baseline CXR: (my read), AP film hyperinflation, prominent hili and increased mildly interstitial markings which are not significantly changed from prior.
Echocardiogram showed new inferior wall motion (compared to [**2178**] prior) with LVEF 45%, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, mild mitral regurgitation, and mod PHTN (PASP 52 mm Hg above RA pressure).
More recently she was admitted [**2087-9-9**] for worsening peripheral tingling which after neg head CT was attributed to natural progression of her peripheral neuropathy.
On this admission was also noted to be hypertensive to the 200's and was started on amlodipine which she had been taking in the evenings intermitently only if her SBP's > 130.

Imaging: CXR [**2184-9-25**]: mild bibasilar atelectasis .
There is prominence of the ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces, stable since the prior examination.
ECHO [**2184-9-29**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-7-19**], more extensive regional dysfunction is present with a decline in ejection fraction.
Right ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present.
Cardiac Cath [**2184-9-29**]: Assessment & Recommendations 1.
Cardiogenic shock with SBP ranging from 60 mm Hg off pressor to 180 mm Hg (with excellent cardiac index) on pressor(norepinephrine) 5.
Monitoring PA line left in place.
Cardiac Cath [**10-3**]: Interventional details Change for [**Doctor Last Name **]-0.75.
Serial dilations with 01.25 mm, 2.0 mm.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and 30% residual ostial stent recoil in the RCA and 30% residual stenosis in the mid vessel RCA.
VENOUS DUPLEX UPPER EXTREMITY [**2184-10-6**] Duplex evaluation was performed of both upper extremities.
# Hypotention/Shock: Shock appeared cardiogenic in nature on cath study but sepsis was highly considered given low SVR.
UA dirty, urine cultures were negative to date except for one sample with staph aureus coag +, pansensitive.
[**12-31**] blood cultures grew gram positive cocci on [**8-26**].
Cefepime was discontinued when urine culture returned with staph and not GNR.
Lactate 3.1 on [**9-27**], likely due to hypoperfusion with low blood pressures, and eventually normalized below 2 on repeat measurements.
Hemodynamically, pt required pressor support on Hospital Day 8, pt remained on levophed gtt with labile SBPs ranging from 90s to 150s intermittently.
On [**2184-10-3**] vanc and zosyn were discontinued as blood cultures were no growth to date, and ID consulting team also recommended discontinuing antibiotics.
Patient was on lasix gtt to decrease preload for cardiogenic shock and this was discontinued when CVP goal of [**10-8**] was reached.
MRI and MRA of head/neck showed no infarct, just atherosclerotic disease in cavernous carotid arteries.
EEG showed no seizure activity.
# Anuric Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Urine output decreased to <10cc/hr on second day of admission.
Renal consult suggested renal U/S, urine lytes and urine eosinophils.
Renal u/s showed R renal artery parvus tardus suggestive of renal artery stenosis and poor diastolic flow bilaterally.
Cath study on [**10-3**] did not show impressive stenosis of renal arteries and no interventions were done.
Urine lytes were consistent with ATN and urine eosinophils were negative and thus made interstitial nephritis related to cephalosporins (history of allergy) less likely.
Following PCI on [**10-3**], Cr continued to trend up with declining bicarb which felt to be related to contrast induced injury.
# CAD: Initially inferior wall STD + TWI similar to ECG changes at the time of NSTEMI 2 months ago, but cardiac enzymes stable, no chest pain.
Pt had troponinemia on [**9-29**] that peaked at 3.89 and cath study showed 3VD - this was concluded to be demand NSTEMI presentation.
On day of demand NSTEMI LFTs trended up slightly ALT 41, AST 64, AlkP 229, GGT 98, and TBili normal.
# ischemic cardiomyopathy: post NSTEMI echo in [**6-/2184**] showed inf wall hypokinesis and LVEF 45%.
ECHO on this admission showed decreased LVEF to 35-40% likely secondary to additional cardiac insult this admission.
Information was obtained from PatientFamily/Caregiver[**Name (NI) 581**].
Amlodipine 2.5 mg PO DAILY patient has been taking this at home QHS:PRN SBP > 130.
However, your hospital course was complicated by a heart attack which resulted in organ damage and required you to be supported by a breathing machine and medications to improve your blood pressure.
