Mid LCx was successfully stented at that time.
In OSH ED, BP 145/66 followed by hypotension.
WBC 19.1  Given a dose of ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Pt given morphine for CP/SOB and BP dropped to 74/42->66/39.
EKG with LBBB (old).
On [**11-28**], pt was diazlyzed 2 L.  Echo at OSH showing EF 25%, significant AS, 2+MR, trace TR.
At 1:30pm, pt having CP, tachycardic in 120-130's, and was more tachypneic, BP 55/39.
EKG w/ same LBBB.
Dopa increaed to 20 mcg/kg/min and BP improved to 100/60.
PCWP 20 mmHg Cardiac index was preserved at 2.5 L/min/m2 by Fick.
CRF (creatinine 3.0) s/p fistula placement rt.
CHF - EF 30-35% in [**Month (only) **]/04 6.
Family History: significant CAD in family  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.6 BP 120/50 HR 76-52 Wt.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated filling pressures with mean PCWP 20 mmHg.
Central blood pressure was 102/61 mmHg on dopamine IV.
Pulmonary pressures were elevated with PA systolic 40 mmHg.
Cardiac index was preserved at 2.5 L/min/m2 by Fick.
Left ventriculography was not performed due to emergent nature of the procedure and to minimize contrast administration in patient with known renal failure.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
EF 20-25% 3.
Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2105-9-30**], left ventricular systolic function has deteriorated, and the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Peak CK 360 and MB 68, and troponin 3.29.
3)Pump: Last echo done at [**Hospital1 **] showing EF 30-35% with 3+MR, mil-mod AS.
Echo done on [**12-1**] showing EF 20-25% (worsened), 4+ MR, mild pulm HTN.
Cr 3.8 on admission.
Pt also had pneumonia on CXR and productive cough on admission.
7)ID: Pt was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible PNA seen on CXR at OSH and WBC of 19.
Pt showed clinical improvement with lowering WBC and afebrile with these antibiotic regimen.
8)GI: Pt noted to have guiac+ on rectal exam at OSH.
Exam noted for 6-7 cm scalp hematoma on the vertex.
Complete neurological exam was intact.
Head CT was not obtained due to stable neurological exam.
However, if she were to develop worsening headache, changes in mental status, or focal neuro findings, pt should get a STAT head CT to rule out subdural/epidural hematoma.
Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
