LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
An echo cardiogram revealed a torn mitral valve chord and severe mitral regurgitation.
She underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed clean coronaries and a balloon pump was placed secondary to poor right heart function.
