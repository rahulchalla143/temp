A CT scan at the outside hospital showed no extravasation; however, she was hypotensive on evaluation with severe abdominal pain.
VITAL SIGNS: Her heart rate was 65, blood pressure in the 60s, and she was 100% on 2 liters.
Her white count was normal, INR was 1.3, and her PT was 30.
Her BUN and creatinine were 27. and 1.5.
After this was done, over the next couple of days she stabilized, bladder pressures were followed, and she was treated for ARDS with an esophageal balloon, and ventilatory management, and an echo was done which showed normal EF.
Her LFTs were followed, and her platelet count was also followed, and her platelet count began to slowly fall.
Because of this, a HIT panel was sent, and this was positive.
From a graft standpoint, she had palpable pulses and good distal perfusion throughout.
However, her creatinine clearance and primary liver function abnormalities did not allow for adequate anticoagulation.
She had multiple episodes of bleeding, both from her NG tube, as well as from her Foley which required significant blood product resuscitation.
As her bilirubin and LFTs began to rise, and her VAC output continued to rise, a hepatology consult was performed, and a liver ultrasound was also done.
At the same time, she had blood cultures which had gram-positive cocci.
An EKG was done, and cardiology was consulted.
The patient's family declined a postmortem evaluation at this time.
Liver failure, 2.
