Brief Hospital Course: # Takotsubo's Cardiomyopathy: At an OSH, the patient developed 10mm ST elevation anterolaterally on telemetry, confirmed by 12 lead EKG (V2-V6, I, aVR) while being transferred to a chair in the ICU.
Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] showed severe anterolateral, apical and inferoapical akinesis with an EF of 20%, consistent with Takatsubo syndrome.
A repeat TTE showed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anteroseptum, anterior wall, and distal inferior wall hypokinesis, and an EF 50-55%.
A second repeat TTE later in the hospitalization showed mild symmetric LVH, mild to moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with an EF 45% and with distal LV and apical akinesis, the remaining segments are hyperdynamic.
**She was started on Lasix 40 mg PO daily for her edema, and this should be titrated to her edema and physical exam.
She will likely need a repeat TTE in the future to assess apical wall motion and to evaluate for thrombus.
CXR on discharge showed persistent bilateral effusions.
# CAD: Her EKG at OSH demonstrated ST elevations in I, avL, V2-V6; Qs in II, III, aVF, V3-V6, yet the patient remained chest pain free.
CEs at OSH CPK 79, index 7.8, trop 0.12.
At [**Hospital1 18**], Trop T 1.23-0.77, CK 119-83, CK-MB 24-11.
The EKG changes were likely secondary to stress cardiomyopathy in the setting of PNA and SBO.
Cardiac catheterization showed normal LMCA with a 40% mid stenosis in the LAD, the LCX had mild luminmal irregularities, the RCA had a 50% mid stenosis.
At that time, she also had a Hct drop of 35 to 26, which was likely dilutional.
She received 1 U PRBCs, and a repeat Hct was 35.
CT abdomen/pelvis ruled out an RP bleed.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on Methylprednisolone -> Dexamethasone, and an AM cortisol was 18.2, which is low for acute infection, but the patient was on steroids.
Her heparin gtt, Coumadin, and ASA were discontinued at that time.
# Right Groin Hematoma: The patient became hypotensive with SBP 68-85 on [**1-29**].
Her beta blocker and ACE-I were discontinued, and she was given 1 L NS without an increase in her blood pressure.
Her heparin gtt and Coumadin were discontinued as her PTT had been >150 over the previous 2 days and her INR was 2.0->5.3 on Coumadin, and there was concern for increased ecchymosis and expanding hematoma at her right cardiac catheterization site.
Her Hct dropped from 30.4 -> 25.7 -> 20.2 -> 18.0.
CT abd/pelvis showed slight interval increase in size of her right inguinal hematoma which tracked slightly into the anterolateral right thigh, continued evidence of recent intraperitoneal bleeding is most likely related to recent surgery, and no definite evidence of new intraperitoneal bleeding.
She was transferred back to the CCU, where she was given 5 U PRBCs, 4 U FFP, IVF NS 4 L, Phenylephrine and Norepinephrine gtt overnight, Vit K 10 SC x1, Protamine 10 IV x1, Lasix 20 IV x1 and Lasix 60 IV x1.
Hct improved to 30-33.
Right femoral vascular ultrasound showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or fistula in the right groin, but did show a right groin subcutaneous hematoma.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, her antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Zosyn when she became hypotensive with low grade fever, as there was initial concern for sepsis.
A diff showed a left shift (94% neutrophils) but no bands.
Initial CXR showed bilateral upper zone infiltrates, left > right lower lobe infiltrates, and small effusions.
Repeat CXR showed bilateral upper lobe infiltrates as well as infiltrate in the right lung base and left retrocardiac region, concerning for a new hospital acquired pneumonia.
Urine Legionella was negative.
Sputum culture showed MRSA, yeast, and GNRs.
# Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient is s/p ex lap and lysis of adhesions on [**1-22**] at an OSH.
KUB at [**Hospital1 18**] showed several top-normal diameter loops of small bowel and paucity of gas in the descending colon which could reflect the presence of an early or partial small-bowel obstruction.
CT abd/pelvis showed small amount of intraperitoneal bleeding and pneumoperitoneum is noted most likely related to the patient's recent surgery.
She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22020**] at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital in 2 weeks.
WBC was 35.7 on admission and peaked at 42.5.
Sputum culture showed MRSA, yeast, and Pseudomonas.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of abscess.
However, C. diff negative x3 and C. diff toxin B negative, so Flagyl was discontinued.
Her RIJ tip culture showed no significant growth.
All blood cultures and urine culture showed no growth.
Her WBC slowly started to improve on antibiotics, and her WBC was 10.5 on discharge.
TSH 8.7, Free T4 0.41, but this was in the setting of acute illness.
**She will need her TFTs rechecked within the month, with consideration of changing her back to her home dose of 88 mcg daily.
Urine lytes: FeNa 0.34%, FeUrea 45.6%.
At the same time it was determined that the patient was being undertreated for her hypothyroidism, as it was unclear initially what her outpatient dose was.
**Na was 127 at the time of discharge, and should continue to be monitored as an outpatient.
# COPD:  The patient was discharged from an OSH with PNA and COPD on a steroid taper.
# Anemia: Hct 35.5 on admission.
Fe studies showed Fe 39, TIBC 107, Ferritin 374, TRF 82.
She also had a Hct drop during her groin hematoma (see above).
**She can have iron studies rechecked as an outpatient, with consideration of uptitrating her dose to her previous regimen.
