There is prostatic hypertrophy with the prostate measuring up to 6.8 x 6.2 x 5.5 cm for a calculated prostatic volume of 121 cc.
CXR ([**2131-3-13**]) HISTORY: Aortic stenosis, to evaluate for pulmonary edema.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram ([**2131-3-14**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Based on [**2126**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**12-9**] years.
ECG unremarkable.
Troponin weakly positive (0.02->0.06), felt likely [**1-9**] demand.
His INR was reversed with 2U FFP.
He was empirically treated with ciprofloxacin despite negative blood and urine cultures at urology request.
# hematuria - s/p TURP 3 weeks prior to admission, with significant bleeding requiring ICU stay, no pressors, but 11U PRBC transfusion as below.
It was unclear why bleeding was occuring 3 weeks after procedure, though this was also in the setting of INR of 3.1.
initially, hematocrit stable around 23 despite transfusion, but bumped appropriately to 27 and remained stable at that level prior to transfer to the medical floor.
upon arrival to the medical floor, HCT remained stable for 72 hours, and was 29 on [**2131-3-17**], prior to discharge on [**2131-3-18**].
renal ultrasound was performed and did not show obstruction but did show blood in the bladder.
His outside hospital records were obtained that showed a baseline creatinine of 1.8.
His creatinine trended down to a nadir of 1.4 at the time of transfer from the MICU, and was 1.3 on discharge.
# CAD s/p PCI - initially, aspirin and metoprolol were held given acute bleeding.
he underwent TTE which revealed preserved EF (60%), E/A,<1, consistent with diastolic CHF.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
you will also need to follow-up with your primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 7 days of your discharge to discuss restarting your lasix, discuss why you are not on an ACE inhibitor, and and follow-up your blood count and renal function.
upon arriving home, you will also need to follow-up with your primary care physician [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) **], within 7 days of your discharge to discuss restarting your lasix, discuss why you are not on an ACE inhibitor, and and follow-up your blood count and renal function.
