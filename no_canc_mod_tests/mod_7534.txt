A head CT subsequently revealed bilateral left greater than right subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage.
He was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further care.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Is reported as temperature of 99.8, blood pressure 150/palp, pulse 105, O2 saturation 100% intubated and ventilated.
His HEENT examination showed no hemotympanum.
His cardiac examination showed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurologic:  Initial head CT showed a large hemorrhage contusion temporal lobe with edema and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
C spine CT was negative for fracture.
Head CTA showed no evidence of aneurysm.
The patient was therefore followed clinically and with serial head CT scans.
His head CT scans were followed and were stable until [**12-22**].
On [**12-22**], a head CT showed worsening global edema with new hypoattenuation areas in the left frontal, bilateral temporal-parietal areas suspicious for infarct.
MRI showed increased flare signal and DWI in the right insula, right frontal-temporal region, left internal capsule, and left temporal regions suspicious for infarct.
Despite the neuroimaging findings, the patient's neurologic examination slowly improved over the course of his admission.
He had a goal of being euvolemic, but at times was fluid positive.
His blood pressure was initially tightly controlled to be less than 130 with continuous hemodynamic monitoring and this parameters was gradually liberated over the course of admission.
His neurologic examination was followed closely throughout his admission and slowly improved, although he still continues to have significant deficits.
At discharge, his neurologic examination was significant for being awake and alert, unable to make eye contact and visually track.
His blood pressures were controlled as above as needed.
Chest x-ray on [**12-20**] revealed a right lung base infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
His electrolytes were repleted as needed.
His sugars were followed closely and controlled with an insulin-sliding scale.
Cultures were obtained.
Blood culture on [**12-10**] from his arterial line showed alpha Strep.
Sputum from [**12-10**] grew hemophilus influenzae, MRSA and beta Strep.
Right lumbar three, four, and five transverse process fractures.
