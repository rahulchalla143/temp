Imaging showed hemorrhagic conversion of his ischemic stroke so he was transferred to us for further evaluation and potential intervention.
On motor exam he is 5-/5 on left grip, unable to fully open hand or perform finger intrinsic testing given old right sided CVA, otherwise full strength.
Coordination: + dysmteria LUE on FNF, unable to assess on right given polio   Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2184-2-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT [**2184-2-3**]: IMPRESSION: Area of mixed attenuation in the left cerebellar hemisphere may relate to acute hemorrhage with surrounding edema or hemorrhagic conversion of an infarct.
No significant change noted compared to the recent study done on the same day.
Head CT [**2184-2-3**]: IMPRESSION: Interval evacuation of cerebellar hematoma with residual left cerebellar blood products and surrounding edema.
Head CT [**2-5**]: IMPRESSION: Interval significant increase in left cerebellar hemorrhage, with increased crowding in the collicular cisterns and compression and displacement of the fourth ventricle to the right, and extension into the left tonsil which crowds the foramen magnum.
Head CT [**2-5**]: IMPRESSION: Interval decreased in size of left cerebellar hemorrhage with slightly decreased but persisent local mass effect.
Head CT [**2-6**]: IMPRESSION: No significant change in left cerebellar hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
Head CT [**2-7**]: IMPRESSION: No change in the left cerebellar hemispheric hematoma, edema and associated mass effect, when compared to studies of [**2-6**] and [**2184-2-5**].
Head CT [**2-9**]: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of left cerebellar hematoma and associated mass effect.
He had a repeat CT head that showed nosignificant changes.
Post-op head CT showed some improvement on the effacement of the 4th ventricle.
On [**2-4**] AM, his neuro exam was stable, the incision was dry and intact.
A stat Head CT was performed and was consistent with significant increase in left cerebellar hemorhage.
The head Ct was consistent with expected postoperative changes.
The patient became confused and aggitated but was easily redirected and a CIWA scale was initiated for Dts.
A head CT was ordered to evaluate any fluid collection and showed stable hemorrhage with decrease in edema.
Neuro checks were decreased to Q2H.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
