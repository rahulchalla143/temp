Pt received 3 units pRBC on [**3-19**]//[**3-20**], with Hct 24 -> 30.1.
Hemolysis labs (prior to tfn) negative.
Hct continued to trend down.
CT scan, neg for RP bleed.
EGD by GI on [**3-24**] - healed gastric ulcers (not source of bleeding), H. pylori negative.
Hematocrit remained stable at time of discharge.
He will need colonoscopy as an outpatient.
Cardiac enzymes trended down.
CXR c/w edema vs diffuse infiltrate.
However, intra-cath ECHO demonstrates good LV systolic fxn (EF>55%).
EKG demonstrates LBBB, ?
# Sepsis/ID/Hemodynamics:  Patient became hypotensive during cardiac catheterization, initially thought [**2-2**] cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] dobutamine, dopamine started, IABP placed.

[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need titration of his medications as an outpatient and close monitoring given new medication regimen.
