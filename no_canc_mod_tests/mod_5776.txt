In the field, the patient was apparently found to have oxygen saturation in the 80's on room air, otherwise, her vital signs were stable.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was placed on a non-rebreather mask and her oxygen saturations came up to the mid 90's.
She intermittently had cough productive of dark brown and greenish sputum and when she had difficulty clearing the secretions and, with the secretions, her oxygen saturation would drop temporarily until she was able to be suctioned.
The patient had a fairly normal EGD and colonoscopy in [**2189**].
LABORATORY/DIAGNOSTICS:  The patient laboratory data on admission was as follows:  White count of 10.4, hematocrit 39.4, platelets 390.
Her chest x-ray showed no acute CHF or infiltrates.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with no acute ischemic changes.
She had cultures of the [**Name2 (NI) **], urine, and sputum which were pending on [**6-15**].
By [**6-15**], the patient's white count was 7.5, hematocrit 37.2, platelets 320.
Her Chemistry-7 was 135, 4.3, 100, 24, 14, 0.4, and 70.
The patient was treated empirically with levofloxacin for pneumonia, despite the clear chest x-ray, due to the heavy and copious secretions.
A free Dilantin level is pending at the time of discharge from the Intensive Care Unit.
She was treated with levofloxacin empirically, and all the sputum, [**Month/Year (2) **], and urine cultures were still pending on [**6-15**], and the source of her low grade fevers and white cells in the urine was uncertain.
Her coagulation studies were normal and her hematocrit stabilized roughly 1 to 2 points below her admission hematocrit.
