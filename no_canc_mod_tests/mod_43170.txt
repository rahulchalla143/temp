Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 101236**],  You were admitted to the hospital because you had an episode of abdominal pain and your blood pressure was very low.
In the hospital, you were given IV fluids and your blood pressure increased.
Your level of red blood cells dropped for a few days and we were worried about you losing blood into your GI tract because we found evidence of a slow blood loss in your stool.
An upper endoscopy showed an abnormal blood vessel in the stomach that may be leading to slow blood loss.
