She sought medical attention on [**2198-1-22**] where she was noted to have an hematocrit of 17, an MCV of 120, platelet count of 467,000.
Her white blood cell count was 22.
Iron studies were within normal limits, however, the patient's LDH was 670 with a haptoglobin of less than 15.
Given the concern of hemolytic anemia and potential myeloproliferative disorder, the patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy, which upon initial evaluation was concerning for multiple myeloma.

[**1-26**] Abd CT IMPRESSION: 1.
Further evaluation with ultrasound is suggested once the patient's acute problems have resolved.
[**1-27**] FINDINGS: Two fluoroscopic spot images show deployment of an IVC filter, with superior tip seen at the midportion of the L2 vertebral body and the inferior tips seen towards the inferior aspect of the L3 vertebral body.
[**1-28**] CT IMPRESSION: 1) Stable appearance of the spleen with several segmental hypoperfusing regions, most consistent with infarctions (particularly given the lack of trauma history).
Comparison with prior studies if available or further work-up is recommended.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2-2**] CT Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Evaluation of the solid organs is limited without IV contrast.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
Her direct antiglobulin test originally was noted to be positive with a weak IgG antibody in addition to a positive anti-C3 antibody.
Blood cultures were negative for infectious serologies and interestingly at this hospital Mycoplasma IgM was negative.
ID was consulted and multiple studies were sent including CMV IgG which was positive, CMV IgM was negative, blood smear was negative for parasites.
Serial hematocrits, haptoglobin, retic count, and bilirubin were followed and evidence of hemolysis persisted.
Further work up for non-immune mediated causes of hemolytic anemia included a PNH screen on both peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsy which did not reveal any findings concerning for PNH or consistent with a malignant process.
[**Doctor Last Name 17012**] was negative, urine hemosiderin was positive, and Donath Landsteiner was also negative.
RPR was negative.
The transfusion medicine team evaluated her Coombs test on the 27th and on the 29th, both direct antiglobulin tests were positive originally for anti-IgG in addition to anti-C3 which was later only positive for anti-C3 on 2 subsequent tests.
Interestingly, however, as of [**2198-1-30**] and [**2198-2-14**], the patient's direct antiglobulin test were both negative.
Throughout the hospitalization she required less frequent transfusions, however her hematocrit continued to slowly trend down.
On repeat serology at [**Hospital1 **], mycoplasma IgM was negative.
Blood cultures were negative.
The patient's infectious workup remained negative (HIV, RPR).
# Bone Marrow Biopsy: A bone marrow biopsy was done at the outside hospital prior to transfer.
A SPEP was checked and was negative.
Repeat UPEP on [**2-8**] was negative for light chains.
A CTA was done which was positive for a nonobstructive segmental PE involving the right middle lobe lateral segment artery.
Lower and upper extremity dopplers were done with no evidence of DVTs.
Echocardiogram was done which showed no ASD or PFO.
A follow up abdominal CT on [**1-28**] showed a stable appearance of the spleen with several segmental hypoperfusing regions, most consistent with infarctions.
A hypercoagulable workup was ordered given her PE and history of CVA of unknown origin.
However, on repeat Protein S functionality, while on coumadin, was normal.
# Splenic infarct: Initial CT showed intraparenchymal and subcapsular splenic hematoma with evidence of active extravasation into the hematoma, follow up CT showed several segmental hypoperfusing regions, most consistent with infarctions.
CT was also notable for hemangioma.
EBV studies show evidence of prior EBV infection.
Abdominal/ Chest CT was done urgently and showed a stable appearance of the spleen, no new bleed.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
The rapid heart rate was felt to be an appropriate response from anemia, PE.
A repeat ECHO was done on [**2-12**] to evaluate for right heart strain, pulmonary hypertension.
Heart rate improved with hematocrit.
# FEN:  She was given a regular diet and her electrolytes were repleted as needed.
Your red blood cell count continues to be low so you will need close follow up for this.
Due to the steroids you have been taking, your blood sugars have been high.
You also had a blood clot to your lung.
You will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] who will check your levels and help you adjust the dose of the coumadin.
You will need to take this every evening and you will need to get your INR checked regularly.
Folic acid: This is a VERY important vitamin that your body needs to make red blood cells.
