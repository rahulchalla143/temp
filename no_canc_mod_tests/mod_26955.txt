Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 70000**] Admission Date: [**2164-1-26**] Discharge Date: [**2164-1-28**] Date of Birth:  [**2083-8-23**] Sex:  M Service:  VSU   PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm, 6.2 x 6.3 x 9.6 cm from the infrarenal to the aortic bifurcation seen on CTA on [**2164-1-5**].
There was concern of some ischemic episode and he was taken emergently to the operating room on [**2164-1-27**], for exploratory laparotomy.
His lactate remained elevated at 4, however it did not rise.
A second look was done at the bedside serially of his abdominal contents to see if there are any signs of small bowel ischemia, however upon inspection there were no clear signs of small bowel ischemia.
He also had a stat echo done to evaluate for cardiac function because of his increasing pressor requirement and hypotension.
Upon evaluation of his cardiac echo he was noted to have significant left ventricular dysfunction with very poor ejection fraction indicating that he had a myocardial event.
Chest compressions were immediately started.
