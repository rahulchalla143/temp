Her NIHSS was 11 Her CT showed no hemorrhage/bleed.
She then had a CTA which showed no major vessel cut-off, but did have decreased apparent branch perfusion of the left posterior frontal lobe.
Her INR was 1.1.
Her deficits improved afterwards, with improvement in her gaze deviation, speech, and arm strength.
After tpa, Right leg 5/5 strength and RUE fluctauates, but much improved.

CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: The distal carotid arteries and circle of [**Location (un) 431**] opacify without evidence for stenosis or aneurysm.
CT PERFUSION: CT perfusion studies including calculation of blood volume, mean transit time, and blood flow demonstrate no perfusion abnormality.
Selected slice imaging was performed through the middle cerebral artery territory, and perfusion defects outside the area of interest may not be detected.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are dependent atelectatic changes in the lung bases bilaterally.
Assessment of the abdominal organs is limited by lack of intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter as well as nondependent air is seen within the bladder lumen.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-3-31**], a pacemaker is now present.
Otherwise, her neurologic examination remained normal.
She will have her INR checked by her PCP after discharge, at which time lovenox may be discontinued once INR is in the therapeutic range ([**1-23**]).
She had an extensive work up including CT of the abdomen and pelvis which ruled out retroperitoneal hematoma, TTE which ruled out hemopericardium, serial guiaic negative stool, and normal hemolysis labs.
She was transfused one unit of PRBCs in the ICU when her hematocrit dropped to 22.1 (to which she responded appropriately) A femoral ultrasound was performed on hospital day nine when the pt developed right groin and thigh pain which demonstrated hematoma is present anterior to the right common femoral artery and vein.
At the time of discharge, her hematocrit had been stable at 26 for three days.
A femoral ultrasound was performed and demonstrated hematoma is present anterior to the right common femoral artery and vein.
Release 24HR Sig: Two (2) Capsule, Sust.
Neurologic examination notable for dysconjugate gaze and resultant diplopia.
Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with your primary care doctor to have your INR checked on Monday.
