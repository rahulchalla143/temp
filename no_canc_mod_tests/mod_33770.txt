The blood pool is of relatively low attenuation, suggesting anemia.
The exam was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis.
The loss of height of T8 vertebral body appears similar to [**5-7**], [**2166**], increased from the remote exam of [**2165-11-13**].
CT L-Spine [**5-2**]: TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the lumbar spine.
Multiplanar reformatted images were generated.
LENIS [**5-10**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
A JP and a chest tube were placed at the time which were managed by trauma.
Additionally, he had 2 units of RBCS [**5-8**] due to a hematocrit of 20.
His repeat hematocrit was 23 but the following morning it was down to 21 again.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 79918**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2412**] was consulted and she has given him tools and resources to obtain assistance with this after his physical rehab is complete.
His fever work-up revealed there was no infectious process present, and the likely etiology was left sided pleural effusion; likely due to surgery performed there.
