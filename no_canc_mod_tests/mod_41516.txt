PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission, the patient had a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure 126/59, heart rate 81, respiratory rate 25 and oxygen saturation 96% on two liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, positive left cataract, extraocular movements intact, anicteric sclerae, oropharynx clear.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 7.9, hematocrit 28.6, platelet count 208,000, INR 1.8, partial thromboplastin time 32.4, sodium 139, potassium 5.1, chloride 106, bicarbonate 22, BUN 66, creatinine 2.2, glucose 110, ALT 12, AST 25, alkaline phosphatase 214, amylase 100, lipase 71, total bilirubin 0.5, CK/MB 3 and troponin-I less than 0.3.
Chest x-ray:  No evidence of congestive heart failure, no infiltrate.
The patient was transfused one unit of blood, with an appropriate increase in his hematocrit to 32.1 and his heparin was continued for aortic valve replacement related anticoagulation.
The patient was transfused another unit of blood on [**2199-1-5**] for a hematocrit of 28.9, again with an appropriate increase to 32.8.
At this time, they declined endoscopy because the patient has had multiple upper endoscopies and an colonoscopy earlier this year, which revealed gastritis.
On [**2199-1-10**], his hematocrit decreased to 27.5.
On [**2199-1-14**], the patient's hematocrit decreased to a level of 24.7.
The patient received an upper endoscopy on [**2199-1-14**], which revealed a single nonbleeding arteriovenous malformation in the pylorus of the stomach, which was electrocauterized, as well as a single small arteriovenous malformation with stigmata of recent bleeding in the jejunum, which was also electrocauterized.
The patient continued to have a low hematocrit, with blood transfusion requirements and a tagged red blood cell scan was performed, which was negative for evidence of active bleeding.
The patient also underwent a colonoscopy on [**2198-1-17**], which revealed two nonbleeding polyps in the ascending and descending colon as well as multiple nonbleeding, not diverticula, in all portions of the colon.
After this, the patient maintained his hematocrit in response to the red blood cell transfusions and he was called out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2199-1-22**].
From this time until the time of dictation ([**2199-1-27**]), the patient had a stable hematocrit in the range of 32 to 34.
On [**2199-1-7**], the patient underwent a pharmacological stress test, which was negative for evidence of ischemia.
He received an echocardiogram on [**2199-1-8**], which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of about 40%, depressed right ventricular function with evidence of right greater than left heart failure.
In response to the fluids he received, the patient developed evidence of heart failure on physical examination and on chest x-ray.
He was successfully diuresed and, at the time of dictation, had much improved oxygen saturation and ease of breathing.
After his endoscopy and electrocauterization procedure, the patient was placed on heparin again and eventually on Coumadin until his INR became therapeutic at a left between 2.5 and 3.5.
Infectious disease:  While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a chest x-ray which was suggestive of possible ventilator associated pneumonia.
His stool test for Clostridium difficile toxin was positive and the patient was started on a 14 day course of Flagyl.
The patient did not grow any organisms from his blood or urine cultures throughout admission.
Renal:  The patient has chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine in the vicinity of 2.
His creatinine increased to a level of around 3 at the time of his admission to the MICU.
A lower extremity Doppler ultrasound was performed, which was negative for deep vein thrombosis but positive for a ruptured [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.
An orthopedic consult did not recommend any intervention and did not feel that the patient had any evidence of compartment syndrome.
