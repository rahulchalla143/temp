Imaging: [**2191-2-10**] CXR - Hyperinflation reflects severe emphysema.
[**2191-2-11**] Cardiac cath - 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and right sided filling pressures, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and low cardiac index of 1.6 L/min/m2.
[**2191-2-10**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia with Left axis deviation and late transition.

[**2191-2-11**] ECHO - The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo M w/ PMH of COPD, CAD, HTN and hypercholesterolemia, who was admitted for STEMI and was found to have coronary vasospasm and elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization.
The most notable finding on his catheterization was that his coronaries appeared to be diffusely spastic and could be dilated with the administration of IV nitro.
His cardiac enzymes peaked at CK of 214, CK MB of 8, and trop of 0.08 on [**2-10**].
He was started on aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin for his acute coronary syndrome, an ACE-inhibitor for aid in cardiac remodeling, and diltiazem and isosorbide mononitrate for relief of coronary vasospasm.
# Pump: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had markedly elevated filling pressures by R heart catheterization and received IV lasix during the procedure.
However, he had an ECHO on [**2191-2-10**] which showed a normal EF of 60%.
He was given additional PO fluids and his BP responded well, so his PO lasix was discontinued since it was felt that he was euvolemic, perhaps even hypovolemic, and his ECHO appeared to have a preserved EF (though likely has diastolic dysfunction).
Once his cardiac enzymes had peaked and he was transferred to the stepdown unit, he was able to ambulate w/ PT and maintain stable oxygen saturations.
His electrolytes were checked daily and were repleted to keep his K >4 and Mg >2.
Medications on Admission: Dilt 360 QD Spiriva Imdur 180 QD Buspirone 10 TID Guaifenesin 600 QID citalopram 20 QD Lactase Pantoprazole 40 [**Hospital1 **] Ativan 0.5 [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Medications: 1.
Afebrile, BP 92-139/50-81, HR 101, RR 20, sats 97% on 2L O2.
You likely need to have a stress test before you can begin cardiac rehab and he will help facilitate that for you.
