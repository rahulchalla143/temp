Compared to the previous tracing inferior Q waves are more prominent and early transition is new.
Ms. [**Known lastname 97063**] was admitted to the renal service, where she underwent repeat fluid check through her IP line that showed WBC count > 28K.
A 3rd peritoneal fluid sample showed marked decreased in WBC count to 1900.
She showed occasional signs of confusion throughout the day (difficulty reciting months of the year backward, slow response time), and had continued abdominal pain worse with palpation but was otherwise in NAD.
CXR showed a questionable new opacity, generating concern for possible aspiration.
She was given IV fluids and her blood pressure was restored.
Throughout this course, blood and peritoneal cultures did not grow anything.
With concern for indolent infection, chest x-ray, blood and peritoneal cultures were sent.
Chest x-ray demonatrated a retrocardiac opacity.
A non-contrast Chest/Abdominal CT was performed.
An opacity was again demonstrated in the right lower lobe.
Since patient was not showing any signs of pneumonia and white count normalized the following day, she was not continued on antibiotics.
All cultures remained negative.
ID recommended repeat imaging in [**12-24**] weeks if the patient's hip complaints persist.
# CAD: H/o IMI, CHF with EF 35% ([**2131**]).
EKG changes in setting of hypotension likely demand ischemia.
# Mitral regurgitation: The patient had severe mitral regurgitation on an Echo from [**12-10**].
She received one unit of packed red blood cells as her Hct was drifting down.
With concern for septic joint, hip x-ray was performed and did not show any obvious source of concern.
Further workup described as above.
Nursing was concerned about introducing infection in her bladder with a straight cath, so a urine sample was not obtained.
Calcium check: Stopped calcitriol 4.
Followup with renal, ID, cardiology and ortho 5.
While you were in the hospital, your blood pressure became very low and you needed extra oxygen to breath.
Since you needed more oxygen to breath comfortably, a chest x-ray was performed which showed a possible pneumonia.
Also, your infections, abdominal pain, antibiotics, and kidney disease on its own could have made you confused.
You had an echocardiogram of your heart.
With concern for another infection a non-contrast CT of your chest and abdomen were performed.
