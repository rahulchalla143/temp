She previously had had a repair and resection of the infundibulum in [**2160**] but has been having increasingly limited amounts of physical activity and increasing dyspnea.
ADMISSION EXAMINATION:  Her weight was 62.6 kilograms, her temperature was 97.5 with a pulse of 71 and blood pressure 110/67.
She is breathing 20 and saturating 93% on room air.
She had no edema and her pulses were normal throughout.
Her preoperative cardiac catheterization showed no significant coronary disease and her preoperative MRI showed likely obstruction of the distal infundibulum and normal left ventricular global systolic function.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  Were notable for a hematocrit of 43 and BUN/creatinine of 15/0.6.
The crossclamp time was 24 minutes and her cardiopulmonary bypass time was 100 minutes.
Her electrolytes were managed appropriately and we decided to treat these with beta blockade and avoid the use of amiodarone.
Her ectopy seemed to improve with better beta blockade.
We repeated the patient's echocardiogram on postoperative day #5.
The echocardiogram was notable for an ejection fraction of 30% with depressed left ventricular systolic function but otherwise no significant abnormality.
At[**Last Name (STitle) 61314**]ime of her discharge her hematocrit was 26 and her BUN and creatinine were 9 and 0.6.
Her chest x-ray showed no evidence of significant effusion.
