LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The maximum gradient across the aortic valve is 13 mmHg with a mean gradient of 11 mmHg at a cardiac output of 3.75 l/m.
Cardiology Report Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2159-9-13**] CARD.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed no significant coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures, with mean RA pressure of 9 mmHg and mean PCW pressure of 16 mmHg and LVEDP of 16 mmHg.
There was mildly elevated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, with PA pressure of 37 mmHg.
There was mild systemic hypertension, with SBP of 146 mmHg.
There was significant aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 43 mmHg, and estimated aortic valve area of 0.87 cm2.
