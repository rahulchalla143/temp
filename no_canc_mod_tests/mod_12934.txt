A couple of days ago, while undergoing a laboratory workup, he was noted to have increased liver function tests, and the patient was scheduled to have a liver biopsy done yesterday (on [**2200-7-16**]) by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
His hematocrit prior to procedure was 26, and after the biopsy a repeat hematocrit was 21.
His hematocrit upon presentation to the Emergency Department was 25, but he was also found to have a potassium level of 5.8 and a questionable ST elevation on electrocardiogram.
He was admitted for evaluation of this.
NPH ([**6-18**]) with 6 units subcutaneously in the morning and 4 units subcutaneously in the evening.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination revealed vital signs with a temperature of 98.7, blood pressure was 103/93, heart rate was 67, respiratory rate was 16, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Extremity examination revealed the extremities were well perfused with 1+ edema.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was alert and oriented times three.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 4, hematocrit was 25.1, and platelets were 149.
Sodium was 135, potassium was 5.6, blood urea nitrogen was 33, and creatinine was 1.5.
His coagulations revealed INR was 1.2, prothrombin time was 13.2, and partial thromboplastin time was 27.2.
A cyclosporin level on [**2200-7-16**] was noted to be 635.
Troponin was 0.25.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An ultrasound was performed which revealed a 2.8 hematoma at the biopsy site.
The patient was initially thought to have a drop in his hematocrit, status post a biopsy, but his hematocrit was back to baseline at 25.
At that point, a Cardiology workup was initiated for a potassium value of 5.6.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled.
However, the patient was entirely asymptomatic and with the correction of anemia he felt that a cardiac workup stress test was not urgent.
They did recommend placing the patient on a beta blocker and scheduling Mr. [**Known lastname **] for a stress test early next week at [**Hospital3 **] Center.
After a blood transfusion 2 units of packed red blood cells, the patient's hematocrit increased to 27.3.
On [**7-18**], his creatine kinase values went down to 18 and 18, and his next two troponin levels were 0.2 and 0.19.
His potassium was 5.2.
On hospital day two, on [**7-19**], the patient was noted to have a very stable hematocrit at 28.4 and a potassium level of 4.7.
NPH ([**6-18**]) with 6 units subcutaneously in the morning and 4 units subcutaneously in the evening.
twice per day (hold for a heart rate of less than 60 or systolic blood pressure of less than 100).
The patient was currently to return to [**Hospital3 6373**] Center where he will undergo a cardiac stress test next week to further evaluate any underlying cardiac disease.
Laboratory work were to be monitored on a daily basis for electrolytes and his hematocrit level.
