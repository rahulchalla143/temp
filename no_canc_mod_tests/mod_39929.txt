[**12-20**] head CT: HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Comparison was made with a prior head CT dated [**2154-4-11**].
EEG [**12-22**]: ROUTINE TIME SAMPLING: Showed a very low voltage background with  occasional bursts of generalized slowing and some faster frequencies, also generalized.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
MRI Head [**12-21**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRV OF THE HEAD: Head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses as well as in the deep venous system.
TTE [**12-24**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to extensive, severe apical hypokinesis with focal dyskinesis.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-9-8**], extensive apical akinesis is now present.
Focused study using Definity contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
TTE [**2155-1-3**]: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mild to moderately depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared to the images of [**2154-12-24**], the anterior and anteroseptal wall motion abnormalities were present ( though not mentioned in the last report)).
ct abdomen: IMPRESSION: 1.
Pancreatic calcifications, consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
Brief Hospital Course: ED and MICU course: In the ED LP was performed and showed CSF - Protein  84, Glucose 327, TUBE 4: 10 WBC 7 RBC, TUBE 1: 14 WBC 256 RBC poly 87 lymph 8.
CSF gram stain and cultures returned negative and HSV PCR was negative, so antibiotics were d/ced.
No source was found for fevers, blood and urine cultures were negative.
Carotid US showed no stenosis and pt.
failed a speech and swallow eval x 2 and PEG was recommended.
Hct stabilized after transfusion, and EGD showed gastritis around the PEG site but no other pathology.
ID (fever of unknown origin):  On the floor the patient spiked a low grade fever, which was felt to be [**1-31**] aspiration pneumonia given right LL infiltrate on CXR and high risk for aspiration.
She was started on Levaquin on [**2154-12-31**] and changed to Ceftriaxone and Flagyl on [**1-3**] given concern for prolonged Qt on EKG on Levaquin.
All cultures were negative (blood, urine and stool), and her CXR was unchanged.
CT Chest/Abd perfomed to r/o abcess or other source of infection and was negative.
Chest CT did not show evidence of PNA.
Repeat cultures were negative.
She continued to be febrile (to 101) and cultures were repeated.
All cultures remained negative, though her sputum grew MRSA.
She spiked again during her course, and at that time cultures were resent, and a ct abdomen and pelvis was obtained (which was non-revealing).
She continued to spike and per ID Aztreonam and Vanco were added while all cultures continued to pend.
This resolved and then appeared again, an abg showed mild respiratory alkalosis.
Ultimately her blood pressure was controlled with the medicines listed in the discharge medication list.
An egd showed gastritis, and with a PPI and 2 units of blood her hematocrit remained stable.
Her mixing study was negative and heme was consulted.
They felt her coagulapathy was due to vitamin k deficiency.
Her vitamin K was repleted, and her coags eventually normalized.
Renal (ARF on CRI): The patient appears to have a baseline creatinine ~ 1.3-1.5.
Later in her course the patient developed severe diarrhea and her creatinine increased and her uop decreased.
Her urine lytes revealed a pre-renal etiology and she was given fluids aggressively (while closely watching her exam and oxygen sats given her chf).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1.
