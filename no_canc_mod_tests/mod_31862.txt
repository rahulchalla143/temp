These were new electrocardiogram changes compared to a prior electrocardiogram on [**1-24**].
Electrocardiogram number two revealed normal sinus rhythm with resolution of ST changes.
The patient did have an episode of hypoglycemia with a fingerstick of 21 on [**2184-2-5**], after the patient received his morning insulin dose, without having eaten breakfast.
The patient received two amps of D50 with return of blood sugars to normal glucose range.
Patient's peak troponin was 12.3 at 4:30 p.m. on [**1-29**] with a CK peak of 415 at 8 a.m. on [**1-29**].
The patient's hypertensive regimen was gradually titrated upwards in order to help control his blood pressure which remained a [**Last Name **] problem throughout his hospital stay.
Patient was taken to cardiac catheterization on [**2184-2-2**], however, the cardiac catheterization had to be cancelled secondary to the patient being unable to tolerate the procedure because of pain from his spinal stenosis.
Patient, therefore, underwent a Persantine MIBI on [**2184-2-6**] which revealed a normal study with an ejection fraction of 50% and no perfusion defects.
Hypertension:  As noted above, the patient's blood pressure remained elevated during his hospital stay and was a [**Last Name **] problem.
The patient would benefit from an outpatient endoscopy procedure.
Patient did not have any further episodes of hematemesis or melena during his hospital stay and the patient's hematocrit remained stable after his initial transfusion.
Infectious Disease:  Patient was noted to have [**2-14**] blood cultures positive for corynebacteria and Peptostreptococcus.
Patient, however, on [**2184-2-7**] spiked a temperature to 101 degrees.
Repeat blood cultures were drawn as well as urine culture.
These studies are pending at the time of this dictation.
