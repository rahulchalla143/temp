A repeat CT-head has been ordered by the ED.
EKG: Afibb, rate 77   Pertinent Results: [**2140-10-28**]   GLUCOSE-88 UREA N-12 CREAT-1.1 SODIUM-142 POTASSIUM-4.6 CHLORIDE-105 TOTAL CO2-27 ANION GAP-15 [**2140-10-28**]   CALCIUM-9.3 PHOSPHATE-2.9 MAGNESIUM-2.1 [**2140-10-28**]   WBC-7.6 RBC-4.09* HGB-13.5* HCT-39.6* MCV-97 MCH-33.0* MCHC-34.1 RDW-14.1 [**2140-10-28**]   NEUTS-67.0 LYMPHS-20.1 MONOS-7.6 EOS-4.4* BASOS-0.9 MACROCYT-1+ [**2140-10-28**]   PLT COUNT-248 [**2140-10-28**]   PT-15.3* PTT-32.7 [**Month/Day/Year 263**](PT)-1.6  RADIOLOGY  HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: [**2140-10-30**] Stable to slight increase in size of left subdural collection.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST; [**2140-11-3**] 1.
Mild rightward subfalcine herniation, unchanged since earlier head CT.  CTA OF THE CHEST W/CONTRAST AND RECONS;[**2140-11-11**] 1) Acute pulmonary embolus in the segmental branches to the right middle and right upper lobe.
CXR [**2140-11-20**]: Tracheostomy tube is 5 cm above carina.
CT of head [**2140-11-21**]: CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: No new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
[**2140-11-22**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 55007**] were performed of the left and right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
The superior-most extent of this cannot be evaluated on this study, and if further evaluation of that is required, a CT can be obtained.
The spleen, pancreas, adrenals, and left kidney are unremarkable.
In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic, round, well-defined cystic nonenhancing lesion measuring 49 x 44 mm.
Note is made that the study was done in late arterial phase, and there are no delayed images as this is a single monophasic study.
PELVIC CT WITH CONTRAST: The bladder is not distended with a Foley catheter in its interior.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is top normal.
He had a CT scan on the outside which revealed a large subdural collection that was chronic in nature.
He was given 2 units of FFP and one dose of Vit K.  He has had serial CT scans that have been stable in nature.
MRI of the head revealed Right Middle Cerebral Artery infarct.
Gag/cough reflex is present, moves right upper arm frequently to chest, moves right lower extremties to tactile stimuli, flexion left lower no movement on the left arm.
Stat CTA of the chest revealed acute pulmonary embolus in the segmental branches to the right middle and right upper lobe.
bilateral lower extremity Doppler showed no evidence of DVT on initial study, though repeat study following week showed extensive bilateral DVT.
sputum culture from [**2140-11-11**] showed CITROBACTER KOSERI which is initially covered with ampicillin until sensitivity showed sensitive to Levaquin  which then started on LEVOFLOXACIN, added Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
postoperative neurologic exam is; opens eyes to voice, left pupil reactive to light, Right eye surgical,follows commands, sticks out his tongue, wiggles his right toes.Postop head CT significant for Status post partial drainage of left cerebral convexity subdural hemorrhage, with interval re-hemorrhage, SDH drain kept, dressing changed and patient transferred to neuro step-down floor.
On [**11-19**] LFT were decreased but overall still elevated, his K was elevated as well as his BUN and creatinine.
Recs were followed and Kayexalate was given, K was followed closely, abd ultrasound was obtained showed No evidence of Budd-Chiari syndrome, with patent hepatic veins.Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.
This has prompted a CT of the abd/pelvis with venous phase for further evaluation.
This exam showed clots not extending above IVC filter.
CXR on [**2140-11-20**] showed LLL infiltrates.
With abx treatment, the patient subsequently defervesced and WBC trended down.
The CT of abdomen to assess the clot burden to the IVC filter showed that there were no clots extending above the IVC filter.
SDH s/p burr hole, craniotomy- Neurologically remained stable with spontaneous bilateral eye openings and R extremities movement.
DIC workup was negative.
Pt had a follow up head CT on [**11-29**] on day of discharge which did not show any residual SDH.
Pt is to have follow up head CT on [**12-2**], and will follow up with the neurosurgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] in 6 weeks after discharge.
