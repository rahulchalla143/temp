LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
He was plavix loaded and started on ASA, statin, beta blocker, integrillin gtt, lovenox, and nitro gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
The patient was taken to cardiac cath on [**2138-12-29**] which showed 3 vessel disease and serial LAD lesions.
