Temperature at that time was 103.0 F., heart rate 92; respiratory rate 23, 92% on three liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORY:  She was anemic with a hematocrit of 27.5, white blood cell count of 13.5 without left shift, hyponatremic at 122.
Potassium 3.8, chloride 86, bicarbonate 27, BUN 15, creatinine 0.8, glucose 159, lactate 2.3, ALT 27, AST 35, alkaline phosphatase 110, amylase 52, lipase 19, total bilirubin 0.7.
Sinus tachycardia on EKG at a rate of 130.
Echocardiogram on [**2167-10-20**] revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, left atrial mild dilatation.
Outside hospital microdata revealed six out of six enterococcus species; later speciated to be pan sensitive as well as three cultures positive for fungal, later speciated to be C. albicans.
Repeat blood cultures were drawn on [**12-2**] and [**1-10**], of which only [**1-5**] revealed C. albicans moderate growth.
The PICC line was discontinued and culture of tip grown again positive for fungemia and bacteremia.
Transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no presence of endocarditis or vegetations.
An ophthalmology consultation was obtained to rule out fungal retinopathy which was negative.
She was afebrile on hospital day one with a decreasing white count and no true evidence of leukocytosis or intra-abdominal process.
A CT scan of the abdomen was obtained given patient's multiple anastomoses with concern for abdominal abscess and/or free fluid collection.
CT scan of the abdomen revealed no abscess, no fluid collection and no intra-abdominal process.
The patient remained afebrile throughout hospital days two through ten with no leukocytosis, no physical examination findings suggestive of intra-abdominal process.
Culture data remained no growth to date after [**1-6**].
Cycled enzymes revealed small troponin leak of 0.04.
Continued on a beta blocker titrated up, metoprolol and an addition, Lisinopril once blood pressure stabilized was made.
Electrolytes were repleted appropriately.
Chest x-ray with no clear indication of pneumonia nor aspiration pneumonia.
At time of discharge, the patient was saturating 97% on two liters nasal cannula with a goal of weaning per O2 saturations greater than 92%.
Blood sugar is consistently in the 100s, not requiring regular insulin sliding scale coverage.
Micronidasol powder, 2%, one application topical four times a day p.r.n.
The patient is to continue with rehabilitation and Physical Therapy as well as Respiratory Therapy with goal to wean O2 to oximetry saturation of greater than 92%.
