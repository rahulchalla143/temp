Per report, she was cold, shivering, but AAOx3, denying any CP or SOB.
In ED, patient was hypothermic with temp 34.6, tachy to 110s, and BP was 80/p.
Neuro exam was non-focal.
Had melena on exam but good rectal tone.
Labs notable for WBC 8.8 but with 92% neutrophils and 2 bands, CK 1217, K 5.5, Cr 2.3 (from baseline 0.8).
Patient had a anion gap of 24.
CT head and C-spine were negative, and CXR not suggestive of pulmonary edema or consolidation.
ECG did not show peaked T waves or changes concerning for ischemia.
During interview, SBP dropped to 60s, and patient was noted to have pulsatile abdominal mass on exam.
Stat abdominal ultrasound ordered and did not show e/o AAA.
During that admission she was treated for [**Last Name (un) **] presumed secondary to rhabdomyolysis, and during a work-up for anemia was found to be guiac positive and underwent an EGD demonstrating erosive gastritis, duodenal ulcers, duodenitis.
H. pylori testing was negative at time.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT ABD/PELVIS (no contrast) [**10-5**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Blood cultures were obtained, but were negative.
A UA revealed 32 hyaline casts, but also many epithelial cells.
A urine culture obtained in the ED grew skin flora.
A repeat cath UA (obtained in the MICU) revealed WBC-11, a few bacteria, but urine cultures were unable to be obtained because the lab did not receive sufficient quantity of urine.
Her subsequent urine cultures have been negative.
An additional 1L bolus was given, a R triple lumen CVL was placed, norepinephrine gtt was started to maintain MAP>60.
The patient had multiple sources of infection including a UTI vs. translocation of skin flora from 2 large unstagable ulcers located on her sacrum and on her L scapula, however, we had no positive cultures.
An Echo was also obtained on [**10-4**] which reveal a hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function with an EF at 75%, making cardiogenic shock very unlikely.
The patient presented with a Cr 2.3 which down-trended to her baseline of around 0.8 after 7L of NS.
Based on her initial BUN of 95, the patient has likely being hypovolemia and in renal failure for multiple days prior to her presentation.
Her Cr remained stable on the floor.
# GIB- There was initial concern for GIB given a pos guiaic in the ED and in the mICU and HCT drop from 38 to 31 over 8 hours.
A CTA and ultrasound of the Abdominal Aorta was negative for a AAA.
Her Hct remained low, but stable.
Iron studies were consistent with an inflammatory anemia, negative for hemolysis, and an appropriate reticulocyte count.
A CT head and C-spine in the ED was negative.
X-rays were negative for fractures.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: The patient's platelet count was 100K on admission and this trended down slightly.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw a CBC on [**10-12**] and have results faxed to the patient's PCP at Fax: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4004**].
Your BP was stable and we took you off of antibiotics.
