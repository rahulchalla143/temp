Patient was sent to [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital1 18**] ER and troponins were trended - 0.014, 0.02, 0.017.
ECHO demonstrated EF 15-20% and consequently patient was transfered to [**Location (un) 86**] [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2183-8-13**]: 1.
Selective angiography in this right dominant system revealed no angiographically significant disease.
The LAD, Cx and RCA had mild diffuse disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 24mm Hg and LVEDP of 46mm Hg.
There was severe systemic systolic and diastolic hypertension with SBP of 169/125mm Hg.
CXR [**2183-8-14**]: 1.
CT NECK [**2183-8-15**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
However, thyroid ultrasound may be considered for further evaluation to exclude neoplasm arising in a goiter if not previously evaluated.

50yo overweight M no [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with hypertensive emergency with systolic HF on ECHO now s/p cath with clean arteries.
# PUMP: The patient presented subacutely with systolic heart failure with an EF of 15-20% and mild global hypokinesis.
# CORONARIES: Cath showed mild diffuse disease with no focal lesions of note.
Cholesterol studies show LDL 66, HDL 29, TG 113, Chol 118.
Optho exam was unremarkable.
Potassium within normal limits therefore unlikely hyperaldosteronism.
Urine catecholamines were pending on discharge to evaluate for Pheochromocytoma.
CXR unremarkable.
The patient had no symptoms to suggest infection and WBC trended down during admission.
CT neck showed tracheal deviation likely secondary to heterogeneous enlargement of the right thyroid, most likely goiter.
However, thyroid ultrasound may be considered for further evaluation to exclude neoplasm arising in a goiter if not previously evaluated.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Hypertensive emergency Systolic heart failure  Secondary diagnoses: Congenital cystic paratracheal neck structure Goiter with heterogeneous thyroid enlargement   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] after an ultrasound of your heart showed that it had a weak pumping function.
A cardiac catheterization was performed, which showed you did not have any significant blockages in the arteries around your heart.
You required strong IV medication initially to control your blood pressure, however it was subsequently controlled well with oral medication.
On imaging of your chest we also noticed a mass along the right side of your trachea that likely represents a congenital cyst.
Your thyroid gland looks asymmetrically enlarged as well and outpatient workup is recommended with an ultrasound.
[**Last Name (STitle) 8430**], or 911 if you develop sudden shortness of breath, shortness of breath at night, increasing leg swelling, chest pain/pressure, lightheadedness, fevers, chills, or any other concerning medical symptoms.
Followup Instructions: PATIENT NEEDS FOLLOW UP FOR THYROID MASS FOUND ON CT of [**2183-8-15**]!
