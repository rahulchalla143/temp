Alternatively, if warranted clinically, contrast enhanced CT could be performed to better characterize this region.
Recommend dedicated CTA examination of the abdominal aorta for more complete assessment.

CT on [**10-10**] showed RLL collapse secondary to possible mucous plug vs neoplastic mass.
She underwent repeat CT chest with contrast which showed similar right lower lobe lung finding (results above) again raising question of inflammatory process vs neoplasm.
Further work-up including bronchoscopy and washings was discussed and also discussed possibility of lung mass and further work-up with this.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and echo did not reveal a source of syncope: no aortic stenosis although [**1-22**]+ AR/TR/MR.
Carotid ultrasounds were performed, and no significant stenoses bilaterally.
Monitored on telemetry without arrythmias.
FeNa of 0.8% upon admission suggested prerenal etiology.
Her BUN creatinine trended down to baseline; Based on records from [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 74467**] Hospital, patient's baseline creatinine appears to be around 1.3.
Held lisinopril in setting of ARF and controlled blood pressure.
INR trended down, coumadin restarted.
