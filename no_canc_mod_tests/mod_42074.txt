She underwent a CTA of her chest, which showed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli.
To assess the strain on the heart, an echocardiogram was performed, which showed right free wall hypokinesis, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and dilation of the right ventricle.
She underwent a repeat echo, which showed no change.
On [**7-28**], a repeat CTA/CTV of th echest was performed as well as a CT of the pelvis to evaluate thrombus burden and to evaluated for iliofemoral clot, respectively.
A repeat echo was unchanged.
A repeat echo showed minimal dilation of the ventricle.
