SHe was started on integrillin, plavix and taken to cath lab where she had 80%LAD after D1, LCX 90% prox stenosis, RCA 90% ulcerated prximal stenosis, 50% before PDA.

CARDIAC CATH [**2184-8-30**] COMMENTS: 1.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease in this right dominant circulation.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated severe systemic arterial hypertension (210/99).
Cardiac output and index were preserved at 4.0 L/min and 2.2 L/min/m2 respectively.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stented segment of the RCA, no apparent dissection, and normal epicardial flow (see PTCA comments).
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stented segment of the LCX, no apparent dissection, and normal epicardial flow (see PTCA comments).
CARDIAC CATH [**2184-9-2**] COMMENTS: 1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed angiographically significant 1 vessel disease.
Liited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic systolic hypertension (171 mmHg).
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent dissection, and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2184-9-3**] EF>60% Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo F with STEMI status post cardiac catheterization on [**2184-8-30**] with three vessel coronary artery disease, and acute inferior MI managed by PTCA and placement of 2 drug-eluting stents in the RCA and placement of 1 drug-eluting stent in the LCX.
ST semgent elevation myocardial infarction: The pt is status post inferior myocardial infarction with cardiac cath showing 3 vessel disease, taken for stents to LCX and 2 stents to RCA on [**2184-8-30**], then taken back to cath lab on [**2184-9-3**] for stenting of LAD.
She adamantly refused the these medications at first, but two days before discharge, agreed to take her CoReg, with her blood pressure decreasing from 180/70s to 160/70s.
At discharge, her blood pressure was 160s/70s-80s on CoReg.
Her Echocardiogram post-caths demonstrated an EF of >60%, with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, and a small secundum type atrial septal defect.
She was monitored on telemetry throughout her stay.
# angioedema- Most likely secondary to the ACE inhibitor Captopril that we started her on post-catheterization for blood pressure control.
Her blood pressure is 180s-200/80s-100 off medication.
Her oxygen sats were between 97-100% throughout her stay.
[**First Name (STitle) 3510**], who was notified of the angioedema and her uncontrolled hypertension with refusal to take all of her blood pressure meds.
She was persistently hypertensive this admission, complicated by her refusal to take her medications, as documented above.
CAD s/p cardiac catheterization with stents to LCX, RCA, LAD 3.
