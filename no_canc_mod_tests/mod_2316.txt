The patient was visiting his daughter who was admitted for a PE workup.
Upon initial exam done by the stroke fellow.
The pertinent positives include the following: dense R-facial UMN weakness, facial sensory loss to LT on the R, a R-homonymous hemianopia (both upper and lower quadrants), and then developed R-pronator drift (deltoid 4), and a R-leg drift (4+ IP).
A CT head was negative for acute pathology.
CTA showed a decreased flow in the L-superior MCA, decreased signal in L-MCA.
T-PA was started at 17.29 (bolus of 6.5mg; then gtt 56cc in 1 hour; total 62.5mg).

Normal CT angiogram with no evidence of dissection or aneurysm.
----- MRI head: FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
His NIHSS was 7.
Head CT was negative for bleed or early infarct signs.
His exam during t-PA remained unchanged (with clear weakness face>arm>leg).
An EEG was performed which was very normal.
Lipids were checked and his LDL was less than 100 so no medication was started.
A CTA of the neck showed normal carotids and vertebrals.
He then had a TEE which showed a PFO and mild-moderate aortic regurgitation(but normal aortic valve) but no other abnormality(including no atrial septal aneurysm).
He also had blood cultures sent to evaluate for possible septic emboli.
He will need a hypercoagulable work-up sent at his first follow-up.
Also consider CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis to rule out malignancy as a cause of hypercoagulability.
In addition, he will need to have a contrast brain MRI performed as an outpatient before his follow-up to confirm the absence of any enhancing lesion that may explain his symptoms(especially as seizure is still a remote possibility).
HIV testing was performed and pending at time of discharge.
