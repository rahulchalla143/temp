The pt was admitted to overnight obs in the ED considering unchanged EKG and negative trop/CKMB.
Repeat EKG this AM, showed T waves flipped.
Pertinent Results: IMAGING  Cardiac Cath ([**5-4**]):  1) Selective angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated significant two-vessel coronary artery disease.
The non-dominant RCA was known to have 100% proximal occlusion from the previous catheterization on [**2121-1-23**].
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial normotension, with a central aortic pressure of 121/65 mmHg.
EKG [**5-3**]: II, III, aVF, V3-6 shows new inverted T waves EKG ([**5-4**]): showed ST elevation in lead V2 w/ ST depression in leads V5/V6 and I .
[**2121-5-6**] Intra-op TEE Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).

Initial EKG showed no changes, but EKG in ED the morning after showed inverted T waves in several leads.
Planned to treat UA medically and cath on Monday.
Trops cont be neg, but ST elevation seen on EKG in lead V2 w/ ST depression in V5/6.
His medications were optimized by continuing asa 325 daily, imdur 30mg [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril 20mg daily, atenolol 25mg daily, plavix 75mg daily.
pt taken to cath which showed restenosis of prox LAD.
BP was regulated on nitro gtt.
