RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2142-6-15**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Coronary angiography in this left-dominant system revealed diffuse coronary artery disease.
Selective graft arteriography revealed a widely patent LIMA-LAD graft.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures, with mean RA pressure of 15 mmHg, and mean PCW pressure of 30 mmHg.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension with mean PA pressure of 38 mmHg, and mild systemic hypertension, with SBP of 140mmHg.
The cardiac output was normal at 5.1 L/min.
CXR ([**2142-6-10**]): IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, bilateral airspace opacity, right greater than left, concerning for pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions, also greater on the right.
Echo ([**2142-6-12**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severelydepressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the posterior wall and hypokinesis of the inferior septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-5-1**], the mitral regurgitation is increased.
CT Chest ([**2142-6-13**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT A/P ([**2142-6-14**]): 1.
Gallbladder U/S ([**2142-6-17**]): 1.
CXR ([**2142-6-19**]): AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient sitting semi-upright position.
Comparison of heart size obtained in portable AP position suggests mild regression of cardiac enlargement.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient was clinically volume overloaded and cardiac catheterization showed evidence of new MR (but patent grafts).
His creatinine trended downwards without the need for regular hemodyalysis.
Patient LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE on [**6-23**] before further parameters could be discussed.
?s and HR 60??????s.
Of note, patient had left-sided subclavian stenosis (proximal LIMA) with disparate blood pressure in upper extremities.
TRANSAMINITIS: Pt's LFTs were consistent with cholestatic picture- he had a negative RUQ U/S and CT initially, but repeat RUQ showed a questionable stone in the gallbladder neck vs echogenic focus, but this was non- obstructing.
His Hct increased appropriately after 4 units PRBC transfusion.
Pt underwent abdominal CT on [**6-14**] to rule-out retroperitoneal bleed given recent catheterization on [**6-11**].
His blood pressures and HCTs remained stable throughout the remainder of his hospital course and he did not require further blood transfusions.
