Stress Test ([**2185-5-19**]): This 50 yo man (s/p MI and h/o VT with ICD implantation in [**2182**]; non-obstructive CAD with LVEF ~30% on cardiac catheterization in [**2185**]) was referred for a CAD evaluation.
CT abdomen ([**2185-5-19**]): 1) No evidence of nephrolithiasis or secondary signs to suggest obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 50 yo M with history of HTN, CAD, CHF with EF of 30%, s/p ICD pacemaker in [**2182-1-29**] for VT, and biploar, who presents with chest pain and R lower flank pain.
The 1mm ST depressions seen in V4-5 have been present in the past on some ECG's.
Thus, it was determined that a catheterization was not necessary.
The pt underwent a pMIBI stress test which showed no reversible perfusion defects.
His blood pressure will be monitored by his new PCP and medication titration can occur as an outpt.
Rhythm: telemetry monitoring showed no events.
He underwent a CT which showed no evidence of nephrolithiasis or secondary signs to suggest obstruction.
His Cr on admission was 1.2 and subsequently increased to 1.9, however, the pt appeared dry and his UOP was low.
He was hydrated with IVF and repeat Cr was 1.1.
Similarly, there is no evidence of kidney stones so pursuing more imaging tests would not likely be useful.
