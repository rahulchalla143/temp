[**2173-4-29**] CT abd: IMPRESSION: 1.
Found to be hypotensive and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hypotension; concern for possible sepsis or adrenal crisis.
Patient was started on stress dose steroids (100 mg of Hydrocortisone) and received IV fluid boluses with subsequent improvement in her blood pressures.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.
Her blood pressures remained stable prior to transfer to the floor.
Her BPs were stable during this hospitalization.
Initial CXR was negative for a PNA, however repeat CXR demonstrated progression of a RLL infiltrate.
Her O2 sats were stable at 94-96%/RA.
She would benefit from a repeat CXR next week to ensure no enlargement of the effusions.
Abd u/s was negative for ascites (slight perihepatic fluid only, likely secondary to her aggressive fluid resuscitation).
A subsequent CT abd revealed NO evidence of obstruction.
Disp:*6 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 11. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) dose PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*30 Tablet, Chewable(s)* Refills:*0* 14. calcium citrate-vitamin D3 315-200 mg-unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO twice a day.
You required several liters of fluid and high-dose steroids to bring your blood pressure back to normal.
Your initial work-up did not show evidence of an infection, but a repeat chest x-ray on [**4-26**] showed concern for a developing pneumonia, so you were started on Ciprofloxacin for a 7-day course.
You should have a follow-up xray next week to ensure this is not getting bigger.
You also had abdominal distension, so an ultrasound was done, which ruled out signficant fluid in the belly.
An xray showed a lot of air in the bowel, so a CT scan was done to evaluate for obstruction.
