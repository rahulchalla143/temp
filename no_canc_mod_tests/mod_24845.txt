Bedside echo at the time showed LVH with an ejection fraction of 10%.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where vitals were 99.5 145 165/98 20 97%RA.
He was given lopressor 5mg IV X1 without effect, followed by adenosine 12mg which broke his rhythm and showed atrial flutter with 4:1 block.
His rate returned to 145.
NECK: Supple with JVP up to angle of jaw.

Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection.
[**2104-9-10**] EKG: Atrial flutter with a ventricular rate of 139.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %).
He was initially in a 2:1 block with a HR in the 140s-150s and his cardiac enzymes were negative.
An electrophysiology consult was obtained and the plan was to proceed with TEE to rule out atrial clot prior to ablation of the circuit.
A TEE was performed which showed probable thrombus in the left atrial appendage and the ablation was therefore cancelled.
He will continue the bridging at home with Lovenox and will have his INR measured on [**9-15**].
He will follow-up with electrophysiology in 1 month as an outpatient for repeat TEE and possible ablation if there is no clot seen.
Echo showed EF=15-20%.
BNP elevated to 7000.
await results of labs on [**9-15**] before administering further injections.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a rapid heart rhythm called atrial flutter and congestive heart failure.
Blood clots were present, and it was decided to give you blood thinners named coumadin and lovenox to allow disintegration of this clot.
You will need to have labs drawn on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**9-15**] and [**9-29**].
Please be sure to have your labs drawn on [**9-15**] and [**9-29**], and to have these results faxed to your primary care doctor.
