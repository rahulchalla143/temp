However, Medicine was consulted given her anemia and baseline hematocrit of 36.
Otherwise, the patient remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic; vital signs were routinely monitored.

She was successfully weaned off of oxygen via nasal cannula and maintained oxygen saturations in the high 90s prior to discharge.
Urine osmolality, creatinine, eosinophil smear, urine analysis and urine culture, were ordered, as well as serum osmolality, electrolytes, random vancomycin level and c. diff toxin.
Given the patient's expressed desires to go home today with VNA, and VNA arrangements to draw and send these respective labs with follow-up by the patient's PCP (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and office for weekend coverage).
