The estimated peak MET capacity was 9.2 which represents an average functional capacity for his age.
Echo report sent separately.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT The patient exercised for 11 minutes according to a Modified [**Doctor First Name **] treadmill protocol (9.2 METS) reaching a peak heart rate of 160 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 164/74 mmHg.
In response to stress, the ECG showed no diagnostic ST-T wave changes (see exercise report for details).
There were normal blood pressure and heart rate responses to stress.
Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 50 bpm and a blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg.
Echo images were acquired within 30 seconds after peak stress at heart rates of 156 - 122 bpm.
Nonetheless, due to the EKG changes, atypical chest pain, and diabetes, he still underwent an exercise stress echo.
He achieved good functional capacity (9 mets) with a RPP >25,000 and the stress and imaging results were negative for a myocardial ischemic syndrome.
His PSA and colonoscopy were up to date and normal.
A comprehensive muscular, sensory, and reflex exam revealed no significant abnormalities, particularly a notable lack of weakness.
# Hepatitis C: Last followed up in liver clinic and biopsy in [**2175**] showed grade [**3-5**] inflammation, moderate steatosis without hyalin and stage 2-3 fibrosis.
We were able to rule out dangerous causes such as a heart attack with blood tests.
A stress test was performed which normal.
