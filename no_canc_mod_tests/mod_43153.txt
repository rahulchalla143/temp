Had emesis x1; NGL done with some guaiac positive return (coffee ground appearing).
GI consulted, felt likely [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear; would EGD only if continued hematemesis and BP more stable.
BP wise, brought down to goal ~190 with labetalol gtt.
EKG with isolated TWI in V6, 1st set enzymes negative.
Had head CT with no brain pathology but concern for intraocular hemorrhage on initial read.
Other workup included lactate 2.2, CXR and U/A unremarkable.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT. CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no evidence of masses, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, infarction, or hemorrhage.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2152-6-29**] 2:53 PM INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with vomiting and abdominal pain.
COMPARISON: Abdominal radiographs from same day.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed following administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained and reviewed.
CT ABDOMEN: There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis.
CT PELVIS: Pelvic loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable, except to note sigmoid diverticulosis.
Evaluation of the deep pelvic structures is limited by streak artifact from bilateral hip replacements.
No specific CT finding to explain hematemesis and abdominal pain.
ECHO [**2152-6-30**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Compared to the previous tracing sinus rhythm is now present with overall reduced ventricular rate and diminished ischemic ST segment depression.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 71 142 96 444/463 86 64 169  ECG - [**2152-7-4**] - Ectopic atrial rhythm with ventricular premature depolarizations.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2152-7-3**] an ectopic atrial rhythm is now present with inferior myocardial infarction pattern.
CXR [**2152-7-4**] - Lung volumes are low, particularly elevation of the left lung base, new.
This examination is not designed for detection of rib fractures which are easily missed.
ECG - [**2152-7-6**] - 7AM - Atrial fibrillation, mean ventricular rate 128.
Compared to the previous tracing no major change.Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 128 0.86 312/431 0 -9 -155   Brief Hospital Course: HYPERTENSION, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY, ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Ms. [**Known lastname 96278**] was initially admitted to the MICU after coming from the ED on a labetolol drip for her hypertension.
SBP was at one point 110 - 120 while on the beta-blocker drip.
After 24 hours of blood pressures in this range, mental status and speech returned to baseline.
Head CT showed no evidence of bleed.
Since she recovered to baseline, further MRI studies were not deemed necessary.
Two days after being called out to the floor from the MICU, her blood pressure began to increase and she was restarted on lisinopril 40mg, HCTZ 25m, with PRN hydralazine.
On [**2152-7-2**], she then dropped her systolic BP to the 70's when her rhythm changed from sinus to atrial fibrillation with RVR.
She was noted to have ST segment depressions in I, II, AVL, V3, V4, V5, V6 and ST elevation in III, AVR, VI.
Repeat EKG showed NSR, but continued, however to show lessened ST changes as above.
Her troponins were elevated (max 5.3) and trended down with medical managment of her ischemia, thought to be [**1-8**] demand during the afib episodes.
She had occasional reversions to atrial fibrillation on [**7-5**] - [**7-6**], which were converted to sinus rhythm with 20mg IV doses of cardizem.
Her rhythm was controlled for over 24 hours prior to discharge.
Patient was also noted to have 2 asymptomatic pauses of 3 - 5 seconds each.
Her INR on [**2152-7-7**] was 1.6.
She should have her INR measured daily and warfarin dosing adjusted to goal of INR 2 - 3.
The workup for this has remained negative throughout hospitalization, and may have been a stress response although blood cultures were pending at discharge (multiple earlier sets were negative).
Her urine cultures, C.diff and legionella were negative.
Her bleeding appeared to resolve as her Hct was stable throughout the admission and she had no further episodes of emesis.
has a ventral hernia on CT from [**6-29**], but no other abdominal process to explain the pain.
Shoulder x-ray showed probable rotator cuff tear.
Cr improved to 1.2 with 250 - 500 NS boluses daily and remained stable stable [**7-4**] - [**7-7**].
SCLERAL BUCKLE: Opthalmology also consulted for a possible intraocular hemorrhage that was seen on CT on admission.
He can be reached at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 102213**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 102214**].
Patient is on coumadin and will require daily measurements of PT/INR and adjustment of her coumadin dose to achieve goal INR of 2 - 3.
Her liver and kidney function tests should be checked weekly and electrolytes every other day until stabilized.
Heart failure - patient has documented heart failure of likely diastolic dysfunction.
EF ~ 70%.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
