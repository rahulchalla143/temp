Compared to the previous tracing of [**2122-5-8**] heart rate has decreased.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF 55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2127-6-24**]   Radiology CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON 1) No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
# CHEST PAIN:  The patient continued to have chest pain on the floor with an EKG showing new prominent T waves although cardiac biomarkers were negative.
He was taken for cardiac catheterization which was negative for coronary artery disease.
He then underwent CTA which was negative for PE or for any other cause of his chest pain.
Finally, he underwent EGD which revealed possible varices which was followed up by GI.
He was given fluids and his creatinine returned to [**Location 213**].
His abdominal exam however remained benign and he denied any pain.
# INCIDENTAL LUNG NODULE: Found on CTA, because of his smoking history he will need a repeat CT scan in 1 year ([**6-10**]), and this will be communicated to his PCP.
Fortunately, all our testing was negative for the most life-threatening causes of chest pain, including a heart attack, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or aortic dissection.
You also underwent a scope of your upper GI tract which showed mild inflammation and varices of your esophagus.
You should undergo an ultrasound of your liver and follow up with the GI department for these findings.
We have set you up with cardiology and the GI team to follow up your chest pain as an outpatient.
And although your cardiac catheterization was negative for obstructive disease, you should still be on a life-long baby aspirin and a cholesterol lowering [**Doctor Last Name 360**] such as atorvastatin to keep your LDL cholesterol below 70.
- START taking aspirin 81mg by mouth daily - START taking pantoprazole 40mg by mouth daily - START taking nifedipine 60mg by mouth daily - START taking atorvastatin 40mg by mouth daily - DISCUSS with your doctor about the esophageal varices and whether the methotrexate may be contributing before continuing to take this medicine  Followup Instructions: Department: HMFP When: TUESDAY [**2127-7-1**] at 9:00 AM With: N [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1387**] Building: Ra [**Hospital Unit Name 1825**] ([**Hospital Ward Name 1826**]/[**Hospital Ward Name 1827**] Complex) [**Location (un) 551**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: Main Garage  Department: [**State **] SQ When: TUESDAY [**2127-7-8**] at 12:15 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8428**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2205**] Building: [**State **] ([**Location (un) **], MA) [**Location (un) **] Campus: OFF CAMPUS     Best Parking: On Street Parking  Department: [**Last Name (un) 12214**] [**Doctor Last Name **] MED GRP When: TUESDAY [**2127-7-15**] at 1 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1013**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5068**] Building: [**Location (un) **] ([**Location (un) 86**], MA) [**Location (un) **] Campus: OFF CAMPUS     Best Parking: On Street Parking    Completed by:[**2127-9-22**
