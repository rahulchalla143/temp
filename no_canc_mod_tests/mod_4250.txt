The next day he was noted to be hypotensive with a pressure 70/60.
Noted to have an intact neuro exam except for incomprehensible speech.
Head CT negative.
CXR showed chronic R sided effusion.
lactate 2.0. .

[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is aortic valve stenosis which is probably severe (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2) but the gradient is low; since left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed is possible that the aortic valve area would be larger with a higher stroke volume.
