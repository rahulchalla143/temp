Immediate postoperative period was complicated by hypotesnion, tachycardia with low grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count to 34.0.
Her clinical status improved on postoperative day two and she maintained her blood pressure off pressors with intravenous fluids and an additional transfusion.
On review of her medical records from [**Hospital3 2737**] the path report states that the right hip had acute osteomyelitis rather than AVN from [**2109-4-17**].
She had an echocardiogram on [**2109-7-26**], which showed an ejection fraction of 55%, normal left atrium and left ventricle, possible mild aortic stenosis, trivial mitral regurgitation, but the study was noted to be limited by patient tolerance.
At the time of this summary, the patient is being maintained on Metoprolol 50 mg three times a day, Captopril 50 mg three times a day, with good blood pressure control.
Her hematocrit remained relatively stable around 30.0 throughout her hospital stay.
Her factor 10a levels (heparin levels) were ~0.6 on this regimen with therapeutic range at out lab (0.5- 1.0).
An anemia workup was done that was most consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
An Epo level is pending at this time, but the patient was started on Epo 5,000 units three times per week for high suspicion of erythropoietin deficiency secondary to chronic renal insufficiency.
A c. diff toxin was positive and the decision was made to start a po vanco 3 week course.
She was hypercalcemic on admission with a calcium of 11.7.
A PTH and Vitamin D 25OH are pending at the time of this summary.
An EMG was obtained on [**2109-7-30**], which was consistent with profound right sciatic neuropathy or less likely a low lumbosacral plexopathy, severe axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, and a mild to moderate generalized myopathy.
A neurologic consultation was obtained and noted that she had a superficial peroneal and sural nerve numbness with a flaccid foot and ankle.
Prophylaxis - The patient should be continued on Lovenox, pneumatic boots, a proton pump inhibitor and aggressive wound care.
