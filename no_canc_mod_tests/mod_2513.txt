Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2197-3-16**] Trans-thoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Left ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded.
BNP was 1116 on admission.
TTE showed EF 60%, RV dilatation with hypokinesis, indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
She was likely becoming progressively hypercarbic as an outpatient due to progressive retention, as she was dozing off without cpap during the day and was also being diuresed with increasing levels of serum bicarb from contraction alkalosis, which may have further decreased her repiratory drive.
The patient is a chronic retainer of CO2 with bicarbonate levels around 40 for several years.
She became increasingly somnolent and ABG showed 7.36/85/80, the patient was started on Bipap overnight.
She was placed on Bipap with improvement, and had her settings adjusted to the following with good results:      Inspiratory pressure 9, Expiratory pressure 6, supplemental oxygen 1-4L titrated to goal PO2 88-92% She remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint without recurrence of somnolence on these bipap settings overnight, and was discharged with Bipap and pulmonary follow-up.
The patient underwent an ablation while in the MICU and was also cardioverted during the procedure for progressive pulmonary edema during the ablation.
She had a stress test within the last year that was negative.
Troponin levels were slighlty elevated (0.17) but CK and MB (5) were normal.
While in the ICU, a V/Q scan did not reveal PE and cardiology was consulted for her atrial flutter.
Her SBP was persistently elevated in-house in 150s-160s and she was started on losartan for additional blood pressure control and potential heart failure benefits.
Her blood pressures subsequently were improved but still mildly elevated (130's-150's).
She will need to have electrolytes checked for monitoring of her K+ and Mg2+, as well serum bicarb, as a progressively increasing bicarb may lead to compensatory respiratory alkalosis and cause hypercarbia.
Her renal function has improved back to baseline with a Cr of 0.9.
