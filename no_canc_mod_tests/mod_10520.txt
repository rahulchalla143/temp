Admission Date: [**2194-2-13**]        Discharge Date: [**2194-2-17**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  Service:  ICU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46 year old gentleman with a history of hepatitis C, alcohol abuse, who was transferred from an outside hospital to the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography suite for evaluation of pancreatitis and common bile duct dilatation.
In endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography suite, he was noted to be tachypneic with saturations of 94 percent on four liters nasal cannula, having emesis of coffee grounds.
His endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was delayed and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
At that time, his laboratories demonstrated an amylase of 1018, hematocrit 50.0, ALT 126, AST 100, total bilirubin 6.8.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated sludge in his gallbladder, and a thickened gallbladder wall with the common bile duct measuring 8.0 millimeters.
A CT of his abdomen demonstrated moderate pancreatitis with a small amount of ascites.
Today, his liver function tests are improved with an AST of 42, ALT 66, total bilirubin 3.0, alkaline phosphatase 152, amylase 399.
He is sent to [**Hospital1 188**] for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Currently, in the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography suite, he complains only of thirst and mild nausea as well as some shortness of breath.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is afebrile, pulse 113, oxygen saturation 94 percent on five liters with a respiratory rate of 25.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratories are notable for a white blood cell count of 23.2 and a low magnesium of 1.4.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.
Chest x-ray with hazy infiltrate in the left lower lobe and a portable KUB with gas still pattern and multiple surgical clips in his left upper quadrant.
Nasogastric lavage demonstrated coffee grounds that cleared with 300cc of normal saline and a green bilious material was elicited.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital 12573**] Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
The plan was to hydrate aggressively, treat his pain with Morphine, start Ceftriaxone and Flagyl, maintain two large bore intravenous at all times, and check blood cultures.
His oxygen saturations were 93 percent on 100 percent nonrebreather and an arterial blood gas was 7.34, 43, 89.
However, the patient had copious amounts of emesis of coffee ground material and became bradycardic to the 20s with blood pressure dropping to below the 70s to 80s systolic.
However, when an airway was obtained, the patient soon after went into normal rhythm and maintained his blood pressure.
Electroencephalogram on [**2194-2-15**], demonstrated severe encephalopathy and repeat electroencephalogram on [**2194-2-17**], demonstrated nearly no brain activity.
