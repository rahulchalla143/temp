An LP was performed for HAs and showed xanthochromia in all 4 tubes.
to exclude possibility of a traumatic tap, LP was repeated and showed 3550 RBCs in tube 4 without any microorganisms.
CTA was performed on day of transfer and read pending at time of this note.
MRI spine was ordered to rule out aneurysm/AVM but patient could not tolerate the procedure secondary to nausea.
Cath [**2108-4-13**] showed no flow limiting disease with EF=50%.
Last ECt tx was at least 1 week ago (delayed secondary to medical issues).

CT HEAD: [**11-26**] FINDINGS: There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8  suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure.
The pulmonary artery  systolic pressure could not be quantified.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of  [**2108-6-7**], the findings are similar.
MRCSpine [**12-4**] CONCLUSION: No radiological explanation for the clinical and laboratory abnormalities noted in your history.
MR [**Last Name (Titles) 48643**] [**12-4**] CONCLUSION: No radiological explanation for the clinical and laboratory abnormalities noted in your history.
Further inquiry revealed a HA preceding the pt's unresponsiveness.
Culture data as follows: [**11-26**]: BCx with MSSA (1/4 bottles), GNR (1/4 bottles) [**11-26**]: Sputum with staph aureus [**Last Name (un) 36**] pending [**11-27**]: Sputum with staph aureus [**11-28**]: Sputum with staph aureus Treated with Clinda rather than levo/flagyl since [**11-28**] (emperic to cover poss comm acquired MRSA).
CXR does not indicate a PNA from aspiration (though there did seem to be an aspiration while pt was intubated).
The CSF revealed persistant blood and xanthocromia and high protein on two occasions.
Pt was covered with empiric acyclovir until CSF PCR demonstrated no HSV.
On workup, pt had MRI suggesting chiari malformation hypoplastic r vert, small posterior art, no aneurysm seen, no acute stroke.
CTA was also negative for aneurism or bleed.
The last possibility that had to be ruled out was a sentinal bleed from a small cranial aneurism that was being missed by MR/CTA, so a angiogram was performed which did not demonstrate any major abnormalities on discussion with the radiologist, however a formal read is pending as of discharge date.
ARF: Cr 2.2 on presentation: (baseline 0.7): Kept MAP >65mm.
