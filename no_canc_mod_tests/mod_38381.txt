Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
ECG on admission showed NSR at 92, TWI V1-V6, STD V4-V5, NSST changes 2, 3, avf, no stemi, with no prior for comparison.
TTE in MICU showed some right ventricular dilation and decreased free wall motion and LENI showed nonocclusive deep venous thrombus in the left popliteal vein.
The patient remained on IV heparin drip, with PTT goal 60-80, and was started on coumadin.
INR was not sufficiently increasing after 3 days of coumadin 5mg, so coumadin 7.5mg was given and patient was started on lovenox shots on the day prior to discharge.
With IVFs, patient's hct decreased to WNL (42-44) a couple days into the admission.
Patient was likely hemoconcentrated (especially given Cr decrease from CR 1.3 on admission to 1.0 in the days prior to discharge).
Creatinine 1.3 on admission, unclear what patient's baseline is.
Routine HCM labs done while in the hospital and results are as follows: PSA 1.1, TSH 2.3, lipids WNL (LDL 100), HgbA1c 5.9%.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3095**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from gastroenterology will additionally set the patient up for a diagnostic colonoscopy within the next month.
Transitional Issues: Patient will have VNA service to help with lovenox administration and INR lab draws.
He will also have an evaluation for cardiopulmonary and respiratory therapy as an outpatient.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw INR on [**2179-11-11**] and fax results to [**Hospital1 18**] Anticoagulation Management Service, Fax# [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3534**].
You will need a colonoscopy as part of your work up.
You should have your blood work drawn on [**2179-11-11**] by the visiting nurse service.
