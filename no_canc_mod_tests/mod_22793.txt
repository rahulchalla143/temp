A 10 day course of levofloxacin was prescribed and a CT scan was performed which demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacities, new since prior imaging in addition to progression of her pulmonary artery hypertension.
Her o2 sats were in the 80s prompting referral to the ED.
With regards to her oncologic history, she first presented to her PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] right breast lump in [**Month (only) **] of this year with ultimate work-up and demonstrating multicentric invasive ductal carcinoma, histiologic grade 3 with extensive necrosis and priminent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates.
Labs were significant for LDH 532, wbc 11.1, hct 26.5 and lactate of 1.3.
A CTA chest was limited secondary to suboptimal bolus timing and poor field of view selection.
She was bolused 2 liters of NS with good blood pressure response.
Concern for imminent decompensation therefore request for admission to ICU for overnight monitoring requested.
Vitals on transfer were 101.3 128 110/58-40's 98% 2 liters.
On arrival to the ICU,  initial vitals were 98.1 112 114/72 81 95% on 4L.
Family History: Mom with an intra-abdominal cancer, unknown type.

CTA [**2108-11-9**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited exam with excludion of the upper lobe pulmonary arteries on the CTA component; therefore pulmonary embolism within the upper lobes cannot be excluded.
Differential considerations include drug reaction or an atypical/viral infection.
CXR [**2108-11-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
MICROBIOLOGY:  SPUTUM GRAM STAIN (Final [**2108-11-10**]):       <10 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper respiratory       secretions.
Bacterial culture results are invalid.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2108-11-10**]):       TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2108-11-12**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..  Brief Hospital Course: 51 year old with triple negative Stage II breast cancer s/p right mastectomy currently on adjuvant chemotherapy with ACT presents with persistent cough, hypoxia and low grade fevers with evidence of bilateral ground glass opacities on CT scan concerning of pneumonia.
CTA was negative for PE, but showed diffuse ground glass opacities.
# Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension on Imaging: CXR on serial exams demonstrate increasing size of the pulmonary arteries similarly suggested on CT scans concerning for pulmonary hypertension.
Echo prior to initiation of chemotherapy demonstrated normal pulmonary artery pressures.
Patient had repeat ECHO which again did not demonstrate elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
