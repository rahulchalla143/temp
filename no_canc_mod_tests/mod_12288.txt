Findings suggest extensive sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease; however, in this setting (and given the lack of prior studies available for comparison), a small acute infarct cannot be excluded and MRI, if feasible, is recommended for further evaluation if there is clinical concern.
TTE [**2110-3-3**]: Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %).

CVP's were elevated in 20's, suggesting volume overload.
A distributive picture was considered, though initially thought to be less likely given that he was afebrile and only mild leukocytosis.
LLL opacity suggested possible PNA, and he was started on broad spectrum abx as above, and pan-cultured.
Pt appeared volume overloaded, and had a known EF of 20-25% from [**2108**] at [**Location (un) 620**].
He had severely elevated BNP to 22,000 and CXR suggestive of volume overload.
His CVP remained in the low 20's on monitoring.
A stat TTE demonstrated EF 25%, severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Given that his CVP's remained elevated, cardiogenic shock was thought to be the more likely etiology.
Echo from [**2108**] with EF of 20-25%, and moderate MR, per [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] notes.
EKG showed v-pacing without change compared to prior.
He was monitored on telemetry.
On admission, his INR was supratherapeutic and Coumadin was held.
Prior baseline from 6 months prior demonstrated Cr 4, not currently on HD.
His creatinine rose, and renal was consulted.
Urine lytes showed UNa of 33, demonstrating that pt had innappropriate loss of Na in urine given renal failure.
His INR remained elevated, and was reversed with 2 units of FFP.
CT head without showed chronic ischemic changes.
Hct was trended and remained stable.
