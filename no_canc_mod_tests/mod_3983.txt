Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-11-16**], left ventricular sysotlic function is now more significantly impaired.

LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2182-5-28**]  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-24**], there has been placement of a right PICC line that extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
NSTEMI: Patient with EKG changes, elevated cardiac biomarkers with troponinT peaking at 1.8, and transthoracic echo with new wall motion abnormalities.
After discussion with the patient's wife it was decided not to pursue cardiac catheterization due to the patient being 5 days post medically treated NSTEMI and the complications that could arise with this procedure.
This was thought to be the cause of his initial hypoxia and was probably caused by his NSTEMI given the new wall motion abnormalities and depressed EF of 35-40% (previously 55%) on TTE.
# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: In the emergency department, he had hyperglycemia, an anion gap in the twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.
Glargine was subsequently decreased to 10 units at bedtime and his ISS was changed to humalog and adjusted for meals.
He then had episodes of hyperglycemia and his HSS was adjusted further.
# Positive blood culture: He had one out of 2 sets of blood cultures growing coag negative staph on [**5-20**] (with subsequent negative blood cultures) and another [**2-9**] sets positive for coag negative staph from [**5-29**] that came back after he was discharged.
A CT head was done to evaluate for an intracranial process causing his AMS but this was negative.
His MS [**First Name (Titles) 21299**] [**Last Name (Titles) 21582**]r and he was back to his baseline on the day of discharge.
His tacrolimus level was monitored closely in the setting of acute renal failure.
Urine culture grew out E.coli that was pan-resistant except to nitrofurantoin (contraindicated in renal insufficiency) ceftriaxone, ceftaz (allergy) and cefepime.
