A CTA at the OSH demonstrated extensive pulmonary embolus with thrombus in the R main pulmonary artery and arteries to RUL, RLL, LUL, LLL.
On arrival to the ED her vitals were 97.6, HR 65, BP 145/75, RR 20, 93% on 5L.
An EKG showed NSR at 66 bpm, TWI in III, AVF, V2-V6, as well as a Q in III.
An ABG on 5L via NC was 7.42/35/59.
Physical Exam: HR 63, 150/88, 20, 94% on 2L via NC.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old female with HTN, DM2, presenting with new large PE and evidence of RH strain on EKG, though hemodynamically stable, being admitted to MICU for respiratory monitoring and consideration of thrombolysis.
An echocardiagram was performed showing that the left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Right ventricular systolic function appears normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
No thrombolytics were required and her A-a gradient was at 90.
She was transferred to the floors stable, and was continued on heparin weight based protocol, after anticoagulation she was started on coumadin and her INR was followed for therapeutic range on discharge it was 2.7.
