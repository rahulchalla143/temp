CT head: [**2170-6-16**] No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
CT chest/ abdoman/ pelvis: [**2170-6-16**] CT CHEST: The patient is intubated with the tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 1.7 cm from the carina.
CT ABDOMEN: There is a large volume of intra-abdominal ascites or intra-abdominal fluid.
Evaluation of solid intra-abdominal organs is limited by lack of IV contrast, though given these limitations, the spleen, adrenals, pancreas, and kidneys appear normal.
CT PELVIS: There is large volume pelvic fluid.
Temperatures were monitored closely.
Cultures were negative.
CT abdomen performed showed pelvic ascites but there was not enough ascites on bedside ultrasounds for paracentesis.
TSH was 10.0.
Also with hyperkalemia (improved from OSH; EKG difficult to interpret given v-paced), fluid overload (maintained oxygen saturation on 2L nasal canula).
Potassium monitored closely- level decreased well while here.
Hematocrit decreased from AM, and concern for falsely elevated hematocrit given hypothermia.
