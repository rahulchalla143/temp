Head CTwas done at OSH which showed a 3cm IPH.
She was given 2 units of FFP and 5mg vitamin K and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.
-Coordination: No dysmetria on FNF on left ___________________________________________________________   Pertinent Results: NCHCT [**2100-9-1**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2100-9-1**] FINDINGS: The lung volumes are normal.
NCHCT [**2100-9-2**] 1.
Foci of parenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporoparietal region and right inferior insular cortex, unchanged from prior study with no areas of new hemorrhage.
Correlate clinically for need of further workup for underlying cause of hemorrhage, that is possibly best evaluated via MRI.
TTE [**2100-9-3**] - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Sputum Cx - MSSA  Urine Cx - Klebsiella  Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo W h/o prior L MCA stroke (residual Rhemiplegia, aphasia), DM2, past tobacco use, s/p PPM p/w L-sided weakness s/p fall on [**8-31**], resulting in a R IPH and small SAH.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care after receiving FFPs and Vitamin K. Her INR was 2.7 prior to 2 units of FFPs and 1.9 after, so she was given an additional 2 units of FFPs.
Her repeat NCHCT at that time showed a very small amount of expansion from her prior outside hospital NCHCT.
Her repeat NCHCTs on [**9-2**] and [**9-4**] showed no further expansion of the IPH/hematoma or SAH.
Her INR has remained stable in the 1.2-1.3 range.
Her neurologic exam had been challenging as she was originally very hyperactive and agitated off sedation and subsequently has been more lethargic (possibly due to quetiapine 50 [**Hospital1 **] which was administered to reduce agitation); she does not attend to the examiner or follow commands reliably and may have had a component of delirium.
Her hemorrhage and neurologic exam remained stable throughout the rest of her hospitalization, but her overall mental status was very poor with regards to interactivity with her environment.
Her multiorgan failure were the primary determinants of her prognosis.
[] Systolic Heart Failure and Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - She was given Furosemide when being infused with FFPs to help prevent volume overload but her UOP did not respond appropriately; she became hypoxic later in the evening of [**9-1**] while in the ICU and was intubated for respiratory support.
A TTE performed on [**9-3**] showed an LVEF of 40-45% with 4+ MR and 2+ TR; the EF was felt to be an overestimate in the setting of her severe valvular disease.
[] Cardiac Ischemia - The patient has had elevation of her cardiac troponins from 0.06 to a maximum of 4 in the setting of her IPH and metabolic abnormalities, possibly suggesting demand ischemia versus NSTEMI.
[] Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - In the setting of the patient's systolic heart failure, the patient's CKD worsened with a maximum Cr of 3.8.
[] Hyperglycemia/Hypoglycemia/Diabetes - She was hyperglycemic to the 300s-400s on the first night of admission and was treated with insulin which brought her glucose down to the 40s transiently; she was started on D5NS to maintain her glucose levels in the 100-200 range.
