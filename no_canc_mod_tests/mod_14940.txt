INDICATION: 63-year-old male status post CABG, presenting with increased white blood cell count of 20,000 today.
TECHNIQUE: Following the administration of 75 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast, MDCT axial images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen.
Coronal reformatted images were then obtained.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
New on today's examination within the left upper lobe are several fluid-attenuation collections.
Limited non- contrast views of the liver and spleen are unremarkable.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
An Echo was performed on postoperative day one which showed normal valves and good right and left heart function.
He was transfused to maintain a hematocrit above 30%.
As Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 59044**] hemodynamics were poor an echocardiogram was obtained which showed some pericardial effusion.
His hemodynamics improved and his chest was left open with ioban coverage.
With time, his chest x-ray and respiratory status improved.
A blood culture from [**2168-7-2**] grew vancomycin resistent enterococcus and a catheter tip grew gram negative rods.
At the same time, a swab from his lower portion of his sternal wound grew enterococcus as did a blood culture.
Fifteen days of cefepime was recommended for complete treatment of his VAP which was completed on [**2168-7-6**].
His blood sugars were aggressively managed with insulin.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed but was inconclusive.
A CT scan showed a fecoloaded rectum and an elarged gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid.
150cc'c of bilious fluid was drained which did not grow any organisms.
He was taken to the catheterization lab for an angiogram where successful coil embolization of left sided rectal arteries and successful coil embolization of perineal branches of the left internal iliac artery was performed.
He continued to bleed however and returned for an re-look angiogram which showed the right internal iliac artery with two branches, one superior and one inferior that still fill the bleeding site.
