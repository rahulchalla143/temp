His creatinine increased to 10 at which point he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and CVVH.
He had an abdominal ultrasound which showed normal sized kidneys without evidence of obstruction.
He initially underwent CVVH in the ICU, and was eventually able to transition to HD given that he was no longer hypotensive s/p the removal of 4 L of fluid after a paracentesis.
PPD negative [**9-13**].
He was started on nephrocaps and calcium acetate  # Cirrhosis- Patient has a cirrhosis due to hemachromatosis and alcohol complicated by hepatic encephalopathy.
EGD performed [**9-6**] showed 2 stage 1 varices and findings suggestive of Barrett's esophagus although no biopsies were taken.
Hemochromatosis genetic screen sent and showed that he was HOMOZYGOUS FOR THE C282Y MUTATION.
His hepatitis serologies were negative.
He should follow up with hepatology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 month, and have a repeat EGD in 1 year.
Given improvement of blood pressure following drop in intra-abdominal pressure, hypotension was most likely secondary to poor venous return due to intra-abdominal hypertension.
At OSH, he was stated on Zosyn for concerns for bacteremia and sepsis, but blood, urine, and peritoneal cultures from there as well as our own were negative, and he had already completed a 2 week course of antibitoics for MSSA bacteremia, therefore antibiotics were discontinued.
Blood pressure remained stable mostly in the 90s.
ABG showed moderate hypoxemia.
Cultures from OSH and here were negative for bacteremia.
As such, all antibiotics in the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] were DC'ed, and a TTE done in house did not show any vegetations.
Hct improved on the floor and remained stable in the high 20s throughout the rest of his course.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - HD schedule Tu/Th/Sa - EGD with biopsy in 1 year - Vaccinate for Hep A and B as outpatient - HCC surveillance every 6 months with AFP and abdominal US - no additional labs pending - patient full code during this admission  Medications on Admission: MEDICATIONS AT HOME: lisinopril 40 mg po daily levothyroxine ativan zoloft flagyl 3 times daily oxacillin aldactone folate lactulose thiamin multivitamin rifaximin   Discharge Medications: 1.
