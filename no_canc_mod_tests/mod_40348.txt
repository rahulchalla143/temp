CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2146-1-31**] 10:06 AM FINDINGS: AP upright view of the chest is obtained.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-2-1**] at 9:42:07 AM The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-2-13**], the calculated aortic valve area is smaller.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2146-2-2**] 7:47 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-1**], there is little interval change on this somewhat limited study.
Patient's blood pressure continued to be low, systolics in the 60s and 70s, during the rest of her hospital stay.
# Critical AS: The patient had a previous valve area of 0.7cm2.
She underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from labs but appeared to be around 0.6-0.7.
Patient's creatinine was 0.9 on admission, likely prerenal in the context of appearing dry.
Her creatinine bumped to 2.9 on day 3.
Patient underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Pain control was achieved with tylenol around the clock, lidocaine patch, and low dose dilaudid with a goal to minimize effect on blood pressure.
Cultures were negative, including blood cx, urine cx and c.diff.
Her hct was 43.6 on admission, likely hemoconcentrated.
Hct decreased to her baseline of 29 during the next two days.
