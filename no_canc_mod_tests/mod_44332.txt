The final pathology on the dermatologic biopsy showed epidermal necrosis with thrombi consistent with DIC.
The final culture exhibited a negative gram stain with only rare coag negative staph which was thought to be a contaminant.
AFB and fungal cultures were negative.
She continued to exhibit poor urine output, thus a temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed.
Her urine output ultimately recovered and her hemodialysis catheter was accidentally self discontinued on [**2125-6-22**].

However, multiple C. diff specimens were sent but all remained negative.
She was, nevertheless, empirically treated on Flagyl and a C. diff toxin B was sent.
A CT was done to rule out ischemic colitis.
The CT was negative for evidence of bowel wall thickening.
Tissue transglutaminase IGA were sent and found following discharged to be elevated at a level of 36.

The patient also underwent electroencephalogram also on [**2125-6-17**] which showed a normal awake and sleep record including sleep up to stage 3.
Fever of unknown origin: Upon transfer to the floor, the patient spiked a temperature to 102.2.
At the same time her white count remained normal and her vital signs were stable.
A thorough work up was initiated including pelvic exam by her primary OB/GYNECOLOGY followed by transvaginal ultrasound with very minimal concern for possible endometritis.
Blood cultures, urine cultures and chest x-ray were all repeated and showed no evidence of infection.
The dressing was removed and this was thought not to be a source of infection and an abdominal series was obtained and ruled out evidence of perforation or abscess and a CMV viral load was found to be negative.
