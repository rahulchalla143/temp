D-dimer was in the 4000s, so CTA was obtained which was negative for PE, but found moderate pericardial effusion.
Cardiology evaluated the patient using bedside echo which showed that there was no signs of right atrial or ventricular diastolic collapse.
Chronicity of this effusion is slightly unclear and so decision was made to admit patient to cardiology service for further monitoring.

CXR ([**2156-10-29**]): The lungs are clear bilaterally with no areas of focal consolidation.
Small nodular densities overlying the left fifth rib are again noted most consistent with bone islands as seen on the prior chest radiographs with obliques.
CTA ([**2156-10-29**]): 1.
Followup chest CT in 12 months is recommended.
TTE ([**2156-10-30**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
TTE ([**2156-10-30**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
TTE ([**2156-10-31**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-10-30**] the findings are similar.
TTE ([**2156-11-1**]): The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-10-31**], the findings are similar (PA hypertension is now identified).
TTE ([**2156-11-3**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-11-1**], the septal "bounce" is not as apparent on the current study.
On the morning of HD #1, the pts BP was downtrending 120->110->90s and his HR was uptrending 80s->100s.
At this point the pt was bolused 500cc NS and repeat TTE showed moderate pericardial effusion with brief RA diastolic collapse.
Repeat ECHO after drain placement showed no significant reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.
The patient's drain was pulled on [**2156-10-31**] and serial echos were obtained that showed small residual echodense effusion with mild restrictive physiology.
TRANSITONAL ISSUES: The cause of his effusion is unclear at this time and ongoing outpatient workup should be conducted to r/o malignancy or other treatable cause.
GI workup has thus far been unrevealing with negative EGD/[**Last Name (un) **].
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Pt should have ongoing outpatient workup for malignancy given weight loss and exudative pericardial effusion of unknown etiology .
# HTN - We continued his amlodipine, carvedilol and lisinporil and d/c'ed his hydralazine.
Results of the tests performed during your hospitalizaion will be sent to your primary care doctor and Cardiologist; it will be important to follow up with your physicians to definitively diagnose the cause of this problem.
