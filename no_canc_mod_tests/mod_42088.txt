His MAPs were stable in 70s while in ED, but minimal UOP (80cc).
Vent settings on transfer: FiO2 50%, TV 478, rate 18, PEEP 5.
Vitals prior to transfer: 96/65 71 18 100%.
A repeat endoscopy at [**Hospital1 18**] demonstrated grade III varices in lower third of esophagus, three of which were banded.
Patient's last transfusion was on the 20th and his hct has been stable around 39.
Renal team evaluated in MICU and determined there were muddy casts on UA.
SAAG of 2.2, protein of 1.4, sterile fluid.
An EEG was slow, encephalopathic, L hemisphere with sharp waves in arrhythmic waves, might have been pre-seizure activity, focus still active!
An MRI demonstrated global cerebral atrophy, but no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality such as hemorrhage, infarct or mass.
A repeat EEG on [**7-7**] had normalized.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Dedicated seizure protocol MRI can be considered if clinically indicated.
CT can be considered for further characterization.
Acute Issues # UGIB: The patient p/w h/o EtOH cirrhosis and PUD, EGD at OSH showed nonbleeding esophageal varices and gastric outlet obscured by blood clot.
DDx included variceal bleed vs. peptic ulcer vs. oozing in setting of supratherapeutic INR (9).
A RUQ ultrasound revealed evidence of large volume ascites and cirrhosis.
A repeat upper endoscopy revealed 4 cords of grade III varices at the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus (ligation).
Once vitals signs were stable and hematocrits remained unchanged, the patient was moved to the floor.
An outpatient EGD has been scheduled for [**8-2**] for a repeat EGD.
Urine output remained around 150ml/day.
His dose was reduced as his stool output reached about 1L/day and he was having difficulty maintaining K. His dose was changed to 15mL TID, which brought his stools to about [**2-17**] daily.
Creatinine elevation likely represents poor end-organ perfusion, although lactates have been reassuring thus far.
# ELEVATED TROPONIN: Troponin 0.03 in ED, likely demand ischemia related to blood loss, also elevated in setting of renal failure.
A TTE demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
He will have a repeat EGD in one week to evaluate esophageal varices.
Of note, his heart rate has been controlled while on the floor with propranolol, remaining in the 50-80s.
Has ascites on exam and demonstrated on RUQ U/S.
A PPD was negative.
Information was obtained from  PCP.
Propranolol 20 mg PO BID hold for systolic <95, thanks!
Nephrocaps 1 CAP PO DAILY 5.
Acetaminophen 500 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 6.
