On presentation to their ED, his initial VS were HR 127 103/98 with a Hct of 20.
He had an episode of coffee ground emesis and an NGT was placed, with aspiration of 300 cc dark red blood and coffee grounds.
He also underwent an abdominal CT that demonstrated cirrhosis with severe esophageal varices extending to the portal vein and a head CT that was negative.
His CXR was read as question LLL consolidation vs atelectasis, and he was started on octreotide and a PPI drip and admitted to the MICU for further management.
He underwent EGD on [**8-1**] with grade I esophogeal varices but no active bleeding, though there were stigmata of recent bleeding.
He then was noted to be acutely sedated in the setting of receving diazepam for ?withdrawal and underwent head CT that afternoon, which was again read as negative.
He underwent emergent EGD at this point, which was complicated by episodes of hypoxia; however, blood was found in the entire esophagus and no clear site of bleeding was noted, though bands appeared to have come loose.
Total transfusions were 10u PRBC and 8u FFP, with and 15 mg IV/SC vitamin K.  Because of continued bleeding and need for a possible [**Last Name (un) **] or TIPS procedure, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Last ABG prior to transfer was 7.42/32/85 on CMV rate 16 PEEP 5 VT 450 FIO2 80%.

Images: CXR [**2141-8-2**]: ETT at level of clavicles, 4.8 cm above carina.
EGD [**2141-8-2**]:  Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 3 cords of grade II varices were seen starting at 30 cm from the incisors in the gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the esophagus.
Other 3 bands at 45 cm and 3 bands at 40 cm.
EKG [**2141-8-1**]: NSR, nl axis, nl intervals, 2 mm q-wave in III, no acute ST-T wave changes.
Subsequently his HCT remained stable during this admission despite having guaiac positive stools.
On [**8-11**], he again was noted to have melanotic stools and NGT suction demonstrated gastric blood.
He had another EGD performed on [**8-11**], which again demonstrated varices in the lower [**12-24**] of the esophagus, two of which were banded.
CXR was concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
Please follow vanc levels and dose to keep levels between 15-20 (current dose of 750 mg [**Hospital1 **]).
This remained unchanged on repeat evaluations while the patient defevresced and his white count remained stable at 14.
We recommend a CT chest be performed within the next week (if the patient tolerates) to eval for any change.
Another contributor to his AMS was hepatic encephalopathty, which was treated with lactulose and rifaximin.
He will need follow up of phenytoin levels to keep in therapeutic range (free phenytoin 2.0).
Specifically, dilantin levels and albumin should be checked twice per week and keppra can be increased to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] once his renal function improves.
FFP was given to correct his INR (2.0 on discharge).
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
