Abdominal ultrasound revealed a large amount of ascites and a small nodular liver suggestive of cirrhosis.
Analysis of the ascitic fluid was significant for 430 wbc with 60% lymphoctyes and a serum albumin: ascites gradient greater than 1.
Cell counts were not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
The patient exhibited episodes of disorientation, and an ammonia level returned elevated.
Ischemic colitis An abdominal CT was suggestive of mesenteric ischemia.
Portal vein thrombosis He continued to reaccumulate ascites despite paracentesis and diuretic therapy, so an abdominal ultrasound was repeated.
A subsequent abdominal CT confirmed near total occlusion of the portal vein, with patency of the superior mesenteric vein.
An EGD was significant for portal gastropathy but revealed no esophageal varices.
Aortic Stenosis The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed only mildly worsened aortic stenosis.
His physical exam on admission was suggestive of left and right sided heart failure and improved with diuresis.
R/O MI An EKG was significant for NSR, LVH, and ST depressions laterally.
Hypertension The patient's blood pressures were well-controlled on his home regimen of norvasc and cozaar.
After the diangosis of ischemic colitis, blood pressure medications were held to preserve mesenteric flow, and the patient's systolic pressures were stable in the 140/150s.
