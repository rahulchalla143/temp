Her VS there included T97, SBP 85.
BP remained in 80s/50s with HR in 80s-90s.
CXR was unremarkable.

CT chest [**2185-4-28**]: 1.
Follow up chest x-ray may be beneficial if diuresed.
Chest x-ray [**2185-4-29**]: No acute change.
CTA Chest [**2185-5-3**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Hypotension: The patient initially required Levophed to maintain SBP 95-105, however did not become symptomatic aside from some lightheadedness prior to admission.
The patient reported that her usual BP at home was 160-180/90-110.
The patient spiked a fever to 102.9 and received blood cultures from peripheral vein and CVC.
Blood cultures never grew an organism, including 1 set from the pt's new HD line.
ECHO on [**2185-4-29**] was negative for vegetations, but did show mild global systolic dysfunction and severe pulmonary hypertension.
On [**2185-4-29**], the patient became tachypneic and hypoxic at dialysis, had an ABG of 7.56/36/98 and was transferred back to MICU.
CXR did not show evidence of pna.
The pt had a CT-A which did not show PE, but did reveal a long tubular filling defect noted extending from distal right subclavian vein, through right brachiocephalic vein, into the superior vena cava which was compatible with thrombus, probably related to prior hemodialysis catheter placed on right side.
The pt was discharged on coumadin with plans to have her INR followed through the [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic.
A hemolyzed specimen measured 6.8, however her K was then measured at 5.5.
Her ECG did not show any significant changes, and her potassium corrected with dialysis the following day.
Please note that you are to take warfarin (Coumadin) 2.5 mg once a day until Thursday, [**2185-5-12**], when your INR level will be checked at dialysis.
