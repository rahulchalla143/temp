She was then changed to pressure control secondary to high airway pressures and a rapid respiratory rate which she appeared to tolerate more.
This was complicated by a tracheotomy which was too big for her and was preferentially ventilating the left lung, having carbon dioxide retention.
A STAT MRI was obtained and showed no new abnormality.
The patient had grown Gram negative rods, E. cloacae, in her sputum.
Subsequently, it was discovered that these Gram negative rods had become resistant to Meropenem.
However, after the patient's coiling procedure, it was decided that as the patient was persistently febrile with a persistent leukocytosis and her vent settings were not changed and it did not appear that she had a new pneumonia, it was decided that these Gram negative rods were colonizer and would not be treated.
An abdominal CT scan was obtained to rule out an intra-abdominal process; this was negative.
The Infectious Disease Service recommended getting imaging of her right hip where she had had a recent open reduction and internal fixation but secondary to the hardware, an MRI was not going to be useful.
No further imaging was sought because at the time that the patient continued to have fevers, it was decided again that these fevers would not be aggressively pursued secondary to the patient's non-improving status.
Additionally, the patient had two positive blood cultures, one with coagulation negative Staphylococcus and one with Diphtheroid.
This was thought to be secondary to fevers and also to withdrawal as the patient's heart rate would improve with Dilaudid.
