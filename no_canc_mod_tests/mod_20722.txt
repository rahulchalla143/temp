MRI showed FLAIR hyperintensity and contrast enhancement in the R thalamus, midbrain, corpus callosum splenium, temporal lobe, and cerebellum as well as leptomeningeal enhancement.
Extensive neurologic and infectious work-up was negative aside from a mildly elevated adenosine deaminase level.
Denies chills, weight loss, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, easy bruising/bleeding.

MR spectroscopy is planned for further management as discussed in the neurology case conference.
MR Spec ([**2120-9-13**]): Unchanged size and enhancement of the right cerebellar and thalamic lesions with unchanged mass effect on fourth and third ventricles from the lesions in the cerebellum and thalamus respectively; increased size of the ventricles since the previous study with increased size of the temporal horns indicating developing hydrocephalus; MR spectroscopy is suggestive but not definitive of a neoplastic lesion in the right thalamus.
MRI head ([**2120-9-19**]): Post-biopsy changes from the recent right cerebellar biopsy with associated hemorrhagic components and mild worsening of the perilesional edema with slight increase in the upward transtentorial herniation, effacement of fourth ventricle and related mild worsening of enlargement of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle; marked improvement in the enhancing component of both right cerebellar and right thalamic lesion; No new lesions.
CT HEAD ([**2120-9-24**]): Stable right supratentorial hyperdensity; Increased distribution of right cerebellar hypodensity, likely due to worsening post-biopsy edema.
Initially, her Tb medications (RIPE therapy) were continued and a repeat MRI was performed which showed interval progression in and recurrence of the previously seen enhancing lesions in the right thalamus, right mesial temporal lobe, and right cerebellum with further smaller enhancing areas in the right mid brain as well as increased mass effect and 4-mm midline shift to the left.
This imaging was thought to be more compatible with a neoplastic process such as CNS lymphoma rather than an infectious process.
There was a thought that this may also be CNS sarcoid; to further evaluate optho was consulted to evaluate and serum/CSF ACE levels were checked.
There was no opthamologic evidence of sarcoid and ACE levels were normal.
An emergent biopsy of the lesion was performed by Neurosurgery.
In fact, a repeat head CT performed after increased lethargy was noted, showed enlarging ventricles and the possibility of a drain for hydrocephalus was discussed, though not placed as her mental status improed without intervention.
The biopsy results then returned as active encephalitis (likely bacterial or parasitic), but still no causative organisms were identified.
Her energy levels and mood have improved, and her cranial nerve palsies (which include a right 6th nerve palsy, left 3rd nerve palsy, and peripheral 7th nerve palsy), though still remain appear to have slightly improved as well.
A repeat MRI will then be performed 2 weeks after the steroids have been discontinued to evaluate for changes in lesions size and monitor effectiveness of antibiotics.
Of note, two LPs were performed this admission, in addition to the LPs she had during her prior admission, and the most recent CSF results show improvement while on the antibiotics, including lower WBC and protein counts (please see results section for full comparison of CSF results).
An X-ray was done and showed Mild OA of the left AC and glenohumeral joints.
They believe the pain and weakness are of a neurogenic etiology, with no evidence of frozen shoulder/cuff related symptoms and recommended conservative treatment with pain control and physical therapy.
Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname 54847**] current neurologic exam shows an awake, alert, oriented, attentive woman.
Also as mentioned above, she has left upper extremity pain and weakness (deltoid [**2-23**], triceps 4-/5, biceps 4+/5, finger extensors 4-/5 and finger flexors [**3-25**]).
Her hip flexors are also weak bilaterally, left greater than right (left [**2-23**], right [**3-25**]); some of this weakness is likely due to deconditioning.
Her reflexes have not been able to  be elicited.
While you were here, the swelling in your brain was getting worse and so a brain biopsy was done urgently to try to figure out what the pathology of the brain lesion.
The biopsy results returned as active encephalitis, likely from a bacterial or parasitic origin.
Multiple blood and CSF studies were sent and have either returned as negative or are still pending.
A repeat MRI will be done 2 weeks after the steroids are off to see if the size of the lesion in your brain has changed.
