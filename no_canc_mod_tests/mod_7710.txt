BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service for further evaluation of her anemia and abdominal pain.
The patient had a computed tomography of the abdomen done in the Emergency Room which was unremarkable except for common bile duct dilatation of about 13 mm with a small nonobstructing stone within the common bile duct, but no stone was seen at the ampulla.
She also had a 1-cm kidney cyst and an atrophic right kidney.
