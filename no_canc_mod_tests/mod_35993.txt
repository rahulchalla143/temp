MRI on [**10-4**] was performed (under anesthesia [**12-29**] to pain) which showed the spinal fusion at C6-7 without evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis or paraspinal abscess.
She refused nasal cannula (uncomfortable) so was put on 70% face tent w/ O2 sats in the low 90s.
ABG was obtained at 7:30pm which showed 7.39/50/86/31 (on face tent at that time).
CXR was obtained which showed atelectasis.
CTA chest did not show e/o PE, but did show e/o multilobar ground glass opacities.

MRI C-spine: 1.
Final internal length is 41.0 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC.
CXR [**10-13**]: A single portable image of the chest was obtained.
A CXR showed atelectasis.
A CTA showed no PE but multi-lobar ground glass opacities.
Pt triggered [**10-7**] at 6 am for hypoxia to 60s on room air which returned to the 90s on [**Month/Year (2) 597**].
However, on the floor, the pt shortly developed a fever to 101.9, became tachycardic to 140s, satting in the low 90s on 10L high flow mask with abg 7.44/40/62.
A CXR showed a worsening RLL opacity.
The patient had a bronchoscopy performed on her on [**10-10**].
Since that time, the patient's fever curve has trended down and her oxygen requirements have decreased.
All microbiological studies to date have yielded no organisms but may have been complicated by antibiotic usage.
You blood sugars were elevated above normal during your hospital stay.
An MRI of your neck showed no further abnormality.
A nerve block injection may be able to help you in the future but you should discuss this with you primary physician.
