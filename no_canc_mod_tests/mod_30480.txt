This is most likely due to a rounded area of atelectasis given lack of mass on CT scan but continued follow up recommended.
[**2168-12-12**] 04:00AM BLOOD Calcium-7.9* Phos-4.7*# Mg-2.5  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 y/o woman with steroid dependent asthma currently on prednisone taper who presented to outpatient gastroenterology today for a colonoscopy to work up a past GI bleed.
She had a FS of 45 and was started on D10 at [**Hospital1 **], but this was discontinued and the pt was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] where she was found to have a FS of 19. .
This is likely in setting of her completing a bowel prep and not taking tube feeds on the day prior to admission, and may also reflect adrenal insufficiency in the setting of a sudden d/c of her prednisone, which was intended to be slowly tapered.
-we held her usual diltiazem for HTN while she was in-house, please monitor her BP throughout the day today and this can be restarted today or toorrow as needed.
