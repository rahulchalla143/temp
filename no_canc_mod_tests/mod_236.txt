A 8 French XBLAD 3.5 guide provided excellent support.
Subsequent angiography revealed compromise of the ostium of a moderate size diagonal and we decided to rescue it with baloon PTCA.
An ACE 2.0 baloon was advanced into the diagonal and was inflated to 10 atms and then to 14 atms.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stented LAD, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
The patient left the lab pain free and in stable condition  ECHO [**2144-9-7**]: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent).
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course by problem: CAD: This patient's cardiac catheterization was complicated by a jailed diagonal artery.
Oxygen step up:  He had a follow up echo which showed no ASD.
