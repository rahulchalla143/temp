She was brought to the emergency department in respiratory distress and was noted to be in a-fib with a rate of 120.
Systolic blood pressure was in the 90s, diastolic in the 40s.
Chest x-ray demonstrated florid pulmonary edema.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the CCU the patient's temperature was 95.2, rate 100, blood pressure 95/42, sating 100% on FiO2 60% on SIMV ventilation.
Physical exam was notable for decreased heart sounds with normal S1, S2.
Lungs were clear to auscultation in the upper half with bilateral crackles half way down the lower lung fields posterior greater than anterior.
Abdominal exam was benign.
Right radial pulse was 1+, left radial pulse not palpable, but dopplerable.
She had 1+ femoral pulses bilaterally and demonstrated no clubbing, cyanosis or edema in four extremities.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission cardiac enzymes were within normal limits.
Chem-7 was significant only for creatinine of 1.6.
The rest of her admitting labs were within her normal range.
Admitting EKG was significant for a-fib which was taken down in the E.D.
with a rate of 120.
EKG was consistent with LVH with strain and possible dig effect as the patient takes dig at home.
A few hours after admission EKG converted to normal sinus rhythm which continued to demonstrate LVH with ST depressions in V5 and V6 that were also consistent with dig effect.
Chest x-ray on admission demonstrated bilateral vascular markings that went out to the periphery, curly B lines, questionable right middle lobe infiltrate as well as diffuse opacification of her lung fields consistent with florid pulmonary edema.
doses of 5 mg IV as her rate remained in the low 100s.
Her blood pressure had stabilized.
On [**10-30**] the patient's cardiac enzymes continued to increase from admission CK of 75 to CK of 384 on the 25th.
The decision was made for the patient to undergo diagnostic catheterization to evaluate for possible cause of rising cardiac enzymes.
The patient was diuresed throughout her hospital course and tolerated that well with blood pressure ranging from 90s to low 100s over 50s to 60s.
safety evaluation and VNA followup visit to evaluate patient's aspiration precautions.
Coumadin was not continued at the time of discharge secondary to INR being 4.8.
