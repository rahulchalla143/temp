He reportedly vomited at 1140 prior to a head CT, and was therefore intubated w/etomidate and succinylcholine prior to scan.
His OSH presentation vitals were T 97.4, P 45, R 16, BP 163/78, pOx 98%.
Where a head CT demonstrated a R frontal SDH w/2.4cm midline shift.
At OSH was given labetalol 20 mg, etenu, ativan 2 mg, succ, decadron 10 mg, keppra 500 mg, ativan 2 mg, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Radiology: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2131-10-10**] 7:21 PM FINDINGS: There is a large right frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with minimal interval change from prior exam.
There is left frontal lobe encephalomalacia as seen on prior CT from [**2131-9-27**].
EMS were called and patient was transferred to an OSH where he was noted to have severe hypertension with BP 210/100s.
Head CT demonstrated a R frontal SDH  with 2.4cm midline shift and right frontal IPH.
His HCP indicated that he should not undergo any aggressive medical interventions.
Repeat CT at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed a large right frontal parenchymal hematoma with transcortical extension and associated right frontal extra-axial hematoma with significant subfalcine herniation with increased 2.6cm midline shift and new areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left cerebral vertex with intraventricular extension.
Prior to elective extubation, exam revealed extension of LUE to noxious and triple flexion LLE, localising RUE and flexion RLE with pupils pinpoint 1mm and reactive, present corneals and gag/cough with plantars extensor bilaterlly.
