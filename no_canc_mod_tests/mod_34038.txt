He was taken to [**Hospital 19135**] hospital and his Bp there was 212/120 and the BS was 144.
His labs were remarkable for a Cr of 1.2 and negative CE.
His INR was 0.88.
His NIHSS was 9, for a R facial droop, R arm and leg weakness and dysarthria.

Overall the study is technically limited.
[**2119-10-25**] CTA head/neck 1.
MRI of the brain is limited to diffusion-weighted imaging, ADC map, and fractional anisotropy, as the patient declined further imaging.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
[**2119-10-28**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis IMPRESSION: Extensive arterial vascular calcifications, including among the coronary arteries, but no findings suspicious for malignancy by CT.  [**2119-10-30**] EEG (Prelim): No electrographic seizures  [**2119-10-31**] TEE No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
His exam was remarkable for a R facial droop with dysarthria and a dense R hemiplegia.
CTA head/neck showed atherosclerotic disease without significant stenosis of the internal carotid or vertebral arteries.
MRI/A Head showed acute infarcts within junction of the left thalamus and internal capsule and bilateral frontal lobes, multifocality suggests a central embolic source.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showed extensive arterial vascular calcifications, including among the coronary arteries, but no findings suspicious for malignancy by CT. TTE showed no ASD or PFO, LVEF 70% with moderate symmetric LVH and grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
TEE showed diffuse aortic atherosclerosis with complex (>4 mm) highly-mobile atheroma in the descending aorta and complex (>4 mm) non-mobile atheroma in the aortic arch, very small patent foramen ovale with no evidence of right to left shunting.
Lipids: Cholest 190, Triglyc 69, HDL 51, LDL 125.
His bp was not able to be controlled with IV lopressor and IV hydralazine on the floor, so he was briefly transferred to NeuroICU for Labetalol gtt.
His Cr was 1.0 at the time of discharge.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
You had high blood pressure during the hospitalization, requiring you to briefly go to the MICU.
You had a trans-esophageal echocardiogram which showed 2 large atheroma in your aorta.
