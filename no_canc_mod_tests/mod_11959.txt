A CTA was obtained and this was significant for a moderate to large pericardial effusion measuring [**3-11**] [**Doctor Last Name **].
An echo was then obtained which was significant for a LVEF of >55%; moderate sized pericardial effusion; and sustained right atrial collapse consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
CXR ([**11-23**])- Cardiomegaly.
CTA ([**11-23**])- No evidence of a PE.
Moderate to large amount of pericardial effusion measuring [**3-11**] [**Doctor Last Name **] on non contrast CT scan without definite evidence of enhancement.
Echo ([**11-23**])- LVEF 55%.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**11-29**] TTE 1.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2159-11-28**], there has been no significant change.

1 Pericardial effusion-Admission TTE showed moderate sized pericardial effusion with RA invagination concerning for tamponade.
She was initially monitored q6h with pulses which remained [**9-14**] although she required continuous IVF for maintain SBP in the 100's and HR remained 100-110.
Repeat TTE showed enlarging effusion with continued early tamponade so she was taken to the cath lab for percardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement.
Fluid was blood with a Hct of 10% with 6300 WBC 70% lymphocytes.
She was monitored overnight in the CCU with only 20cc of drain output after pericardiocentesis so drain was pulled the next morning after repeat TTE showed no recurrence of effusion.
PPD was placed and found to be negative, TSH was normal, [**Doctor First Name **] and DS-DNA, C3, C4 were negative and she was ruled out for influenza A and B.
We talked with her PCP and recommended on discharge that she get repeat TTE and CXR in one week.
Anemia- Fe studies suggested some component of AOCD but also an inflammatory process with increasing ferritin.
SPEP and UPEP were negative, hemolysis labs were negative and hematuria was not enought to account fot this level of anemia.
4) You should have a repeat echocardiogram and chest X-ray next week.
