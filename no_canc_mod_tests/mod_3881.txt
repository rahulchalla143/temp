STUDY: CTA of the torso; MDCT images were generated through the chest, abdomen and pelvis after the administration of 90 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast.
ABDOMEN: In the left lobe of the liver, there are three well-circumscribed hypodensities, the largest of which measures 25 x 24 mm (3; 95).
The small and large intestine show no evidence of obstruction or wall thickening, enhances normally.
The celiac, SMA, renal, and iliac arteries opacify normally, although with the diversion of flow from the high pressure aortic system to the low-pressure venous system, decreased flow to the mesenteric and lower extremity circulations resulting in underlying ischemia cannot be ruled out.
Diffuse emphysematous changes with numerous spiculated 4-mm pulmonary nodules; while the number of nodules is reassuring, the possibility of malignancy cannot be excluded and so a 6- to 12-month followup chest CT is recommended.
Upon arival a CT scan was done showing fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm extending from the renal artery takeoff to the iliac bifurcation; the aneurysm has eroded into the left renal vein creating arteriovenous fistula between the aorta and left renal vein.
His gttw were weaned off and he remained was hemodynamically stable.
