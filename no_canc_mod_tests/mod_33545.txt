**FINAL REPORT [**2125-5-2**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2125-5-2**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
---- CXR ([**2125-4-27**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
---- CT head ([**2125-4-27**]):  IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and mild regional mass effect and 6 mm leftward subfalcine herniation.
Differential included hemmorhagic conversion of infarct with embolic infarctions versus amyloid disease with hemmorhage and superimposed embolic infarctions.
---- MR head - limited study ([**2125-4-30**]): IMPRESSION: No significant change compared to one day prior.
--- ECHO ([**2125-5-1**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
A followup MRI with gadolinium could be obtained in three months to evaluate for an underlying abnormality.
A repeat head CT ([**4-28**]) was obtained and found to demonstrate a stable bleed.
An MRI was obtained on ([**4-29**]) in order to evaluate for a potential underlying mass as the etiology of the bleed.
An ECHO was then pursued ([**2125-5-1**]), and this did not show any abnormalities.
In order to prevent future events you should make sure that your blood pressure is well controlled.
