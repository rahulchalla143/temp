CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: A suprapubic catheter ends the urinary bladder is unchanged.
CT ANGIOGRAM: The suprarenal aorta is normal in caliber.
The patient is status post embolization of the right internal iliac artery, a finding which is unchanged from the recent comparison CT.
CXR [**2197-2-9**]: FINDINGS: Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube and central line with no evidence of pneumothorax.
EGD [**2197-2-8**]: Findings: Esophagus: 	 Excavated Lesions: A single non-bleeding 5 mm ulcer was found in the gastroesophageal junction.
A clot suggested recent bleeding and there were two vissible vessels.
An urgent EGD was performed with intubation and anesthesia.
His hematocrit was 22 on arrival to the MICU, after a total of seven units PRBC, his repeat hematocrit was 29.
He experienced no further episodes of bleeding, and his hematocrit remained stable.
Myocardial infarction was ruled out by EKG and serial troponins and cardiac enzymes.
# Infrarenal AAA with b/l common iliac aneurysms: CT scan demonstrated no evidence of aorto-enteric fistula.
Upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD) was performed and found a bleeding ulcer in your stomach.
Since this procedure, your blood count levels have remained stable.
