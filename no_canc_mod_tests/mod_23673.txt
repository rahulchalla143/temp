At [**Hospital **] Hospital, the patient had a prolonged and complicated course with extensive evaluation of her elevated LFTs.
Viral hepatitis serologies were negative as was CMV PCR.
She underwent a liver biopsy on [**2116-4-5**] that showed "ongoing severe liver injury with extensive hepatocyte damage and resulting collapse.
She underwent endoscopy that demonstrated a 10 cm hiatal hernia and gastric volvulus with edema and erythema of the stomach and an erosion at the GE junction.
Colonoscopy showed grade IV internal hemorrhoids and 2 colonic ulcerations that were ischemic in nature and a 2 mm polyp that was resected.
Her LFTs remained abnormal with AST of 146 and ALT 103.
She was transferred, at the request of her family, to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-5-21**] for further evaluation as they were still seeking a diagnosis for her illness.

LIVER BIOPSY, PATHOLOGY ([**2116-5-26**]): 1.
Minimal steatosis (involving <5% of the core biopsy; score 0)  2D ECHO ([**2116-6-1**]): Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
MRI ABDOMEN & PELVIS ([**2116-6-3**]): 1.
RENAL ULTRASOUND ([**2116-6-6**]): Essentially normal renal ultrasound.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2116-6-14**]): 1.
Improved aeration of lung parenchyma, with persistent predominantly basal consolidations and perihilar ground-glass opacities.
When clinically appropriate, if the patient can have a contrast-enhanced CT or MR examination, depending patient factors, this appearance could be investigated further.
CT ABD/PELVIS ([**2116-6-25**]): 1.
While this may be due to underdistended bowel, focal colitis cannot be excluded.
Previously described thickening of the distal colon is not seen on today's study and may have been due to underdistension on the previous study.
MR HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST ([**2116-6-28**]): Non-specific, nonenhancing focus of high signal on FLAIR and T2 weighted images in the left parietal lobe.
MICROBIOLOGY: [**5-27**] HD catheter - Coag neg staph [**6-26**] HD catheter - Coag neg staph [**6-28**] Blood cultures - VRE Multiple sputum and urine cultures showing undifferentiated yeast.
Pathology was consistent with stage 3-4 fibrosis thought to be secondary to NASH.
# Dysphagia, hoarse voice: barium study evaluation revealed a large hiatal hernia, and OSH upper endoscopy showed possible gastric volvulus.
Bronchoscopy specimens only grew yeast.
# Coag negative staph bacteremia: On [**5-29**] bottle grew GPCs which turned out to be coag negative staph.
Surveilance cultures were negative, and this was felt to be likely a contaminant.

[**6-18**]: Urine output continues to improve.
[**6-22**]: repeat swallow study was performed demonstrating poor interest in intake, no aspiration or mechanical issue with deglutition.
Blood cultures were drawn x 2.
Multiple sputum cultures and a mini-BAL were negative except for undifferentiated yeast.
# Fevers and persistent leukocytosis: Patient had multiple infectious workups including repeat negative blood/sputum/urine/catheter tip cultures, negative CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, negative CT neck, cardiac echo negative for vegetations.
She did have one positive blood culture for VRE early in her MICU stay.
# Renal failure: Patient's creatinine was 1.2 upon admission to the MICU and improved without intervention.
She had intermittent increased abdominal distension which was evaluated on multiple abdominal KUBs, ultrasounds, CT scans which did not show acute abdominal processes.
Diagnostic paracenteses x2 did not demonstrate SBP and ascites did not increase drastically during her MICU stay.
[**Name2 (NI) **] had repeat negative head CTs and an MRI negative for acute abnormalities.
Paracentesis on [**6-14**] and [**6-30**] negative for SBP.
