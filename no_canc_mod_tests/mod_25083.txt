For further exploration she underwent a cardiac MRI at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-16**] that showed a significant left to right shunting with Qp/Qs flow at 2.6.
As a result, she then underwent a chest CTA on [**4-11**], which conclusively showed the presence of anomalous pulmonary vein return with the right superior pulmonary vein draining into the right atrium and also the right inferior pulmonary vein being confluent with the left atrium and right atrium.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Her preoperative workup revealed an E coli urinary tract infection which was treated prior to her same day admission for surgery.
POD#1 she was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
