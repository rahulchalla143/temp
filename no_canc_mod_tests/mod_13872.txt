Etiologies considered included acute intracranial processes, hypoglycemia, toxic/metabolic insults, infection, ingestions and cardiac etiologies.
CT of the head was negative for hemorrhage or mass.
CXR and urine were without evidence of infection.
EKG was unremarkable.
Toxicology screens positive for opiates, benzodiazepines, cocaine and ethanol making toxic insult likely.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were all negative.
Sputum cultures grew group A strep but were otherwise negative.
Given this, a neurology consultation was requested and an MR of the brain was ordered.
Some DWI images were obtained, and the read of the MR was negative for acute ischemia.
The neurology team felt that her exam was most consistent with an anoxic brain injury which was unmasking latent neurologic symptoms possibly including the disconjugate gaze on an unclear history or baseline of neurologic function.

Repeat CXR revealed the presence of bilateral infiltrates concerning for ARDS in the setting of likely aspiration.
Sputum cultures grew Group A strep but were otherwise negative.
finger stick glucose was elevated in this setting, but resolved once steroids stopped.
Blood and urine cultures were all negative.
Sputum cultures with only group A strep.
# Anemia: On admission the patient's hematocrit was 36.
Her anemia was macrocytic with an MCV of 101.
No further workup was initiated at this time.
#Amylase/Lipase elevation: Patient will elevated lipase and amylase on admission with triglycerides of 566.
No further workup was pursued.
#Anti-E-Antibody During cross-match, pathology found that the patient had anti-E antigen antibody and made the recommendations below: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname 59365**] has a new diagnosis of an anti-E antibody.
Nicotine 14 mg/24 hr Patch 24 hr Sig: One (1) Patch 24 hr Transdermal DAILY (Daily) for 2 weeks: Use this for 2 weeks, then 7mg patch for 2 weeks.
