While on the fishing boat, he had worsening dyspnea and chest pressure, and was sent by EMS to [**Hospital3 **].
His chest pressure improved with nitro, morphine, and aspirin.
EKG appeared to have no ischemic changes.
He arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] satting in the 80's on room air, and improved to 93% on 2L NC.
Given his somnolence, an ABG was done which showed 7.25/94/45/47.
CXR was felt to be consistent with failure, though official read was "clear", and he was given 20 IV lasix, resulting in 1500mL out.
EKG was done which showed no acute changes.
BNP was 209.
He had a non-contrast chest CT, which demonstrated diffuse patchy bilateral ground opacities and interlobular septal thickening, and moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions with atelectasis.
Chest CT (same day as CXR): FINDINGS: There are diffuse patchy ground-glass opacifications within both lung fields.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
TVI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.
Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).

He should have repeat PFTs done to better characterize his COPD.
#) CHF: Chest CT consistent with pulmonary edema.
TTE was done, which demonstrated predominantly diastolic dysfunction, most likely [**12-31**] tachycardia in setting of increased sympathetic drive from COPD exacerbation, and beta-blockade will be important facet of outpatient regimen.
He was also instructed to make an appointment to see his PCP this week for follow-up of his respiratory and volume status, with further adjustments to be carried out on an outpatient basis.
#) Chest pressure - Admits stable anginal symptoms, with exertional chest pressure.
Should have an outpatient stress test to r/o reversible defects once respiratory status optimized.
LDL found to be 84 at OSH, so statin not started, although could consider adding statin as outpatient for overall efects on plaque stabilization if CAD is ongoing concern.

You also should have Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] schedule you for an exercise stress test within the next 2-4 weeks.
