Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
Compared with the images of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-4-2**], the size of the pericardial effusion has increased and there are echo signs for early tamponade (however, estimated right atrial pressure is low, which indicate low circulatory volume.
Repeat echo ([**4-16**]): There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-4-16**], large pericardial effusion is no longer present.
CXR ([**4-16**]):  IMPRESSION: Interval extubation without complication.
Brief Hospital Course: Four days before AAA repair, Mr. [**Known lastname 19837**] had a thallium stress test at [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital which found no evidence of ischemia or infarct and borderline left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 50%.
TSH done post procedure was 99 uIU/mL with T4 4.4ug/dL.
Echo was obtained and showed worsening pericardial effusion from [**4-2**] with possible tamponade physiology.
Cardiac enzymes were also cycled for vomiting.
Troponins were 0.05/ 0.06/ 0.07.
BNP 784, diuresed with IV lasix with some improvement; required 2L O2.
Echo was obtained and showed worsening pericardial effusion from [**4-2**] with possible tamponade physiology.
BP 140 > 87 > 140s.
HR 70s > 40s > 70s.
On the floor, the pericardia fluid culture returned with Strep viridans sensitive to vancomycin.
His catheterization site was clean, dry, and intact throughout stay on medicine floor.
Prednisone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 1 tablet 13hours prior to CT scan, 1 tablet 7 hours prior to CT scan and 1 tablet 1 hr prior to CT scan Tablet PO as directed for 3 doses: this is given as prophylaxis given your iodine allergy.
Benadryl 25 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO once, one hour prior to your CT scan for 1 doses: due to your contrast dye allergy.
Outpatient Lab Work Blood labs for [**2195-4-24**]: TSH, TT4, FT4, T3 uptake 9.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
Get bloodwork drawn on [**2195-4-24**] (thyroid tests: TSH, TT4, FT4, T3 uptake).
First you will get a CT scan at 11:30am, then have your appointment at 1:15pm.
