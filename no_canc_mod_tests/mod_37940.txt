# Cholecystitis / Cholangitis: -S/P ERCP with sphincterotomy [**2164-8-21**] -treated with Unasyn until [**8-26**], chanced to PO Cipro and Flagyl then -LFTs improved and she tolerated food -Will need cholecystectomy in approximately 3 months (post cardiac cath, see below) -Will need EUS for incidental cyst of pancreas seen on ERCP with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks  #Acute blood loss anemia: -Her Hct dropped from 31.0 to 25.3 following the ERCP, and she was transfused 1 unit PRBCs on [**2164-8-22**] with an appropriate increase in her Hct  #Acute MI, Type II (NSTEMI) -EKG in the ED initially showed ST depressions in V4-6, which resolved when she became normotensive.
-Toponin peaked at 0.49 on [**8-21**] -Stress MIBI off beta blockers on [**8-24**] was positive: a moderate, partially reversible perfusion defect in the mid-anterior and mid-anterolateral walls with corresponding mild hypokinesis, and a drop in EF from 55% to 45% with stress (compared to at rest/baseline) -Cardiology followed pt and recommended a) maximizing medical management, b)outpatient cardiology evaluation, followed by c)cardiac cath as an outpatient -Medical management: beta blocker (dose increased until limited by HR; lisinopril; ASA.
-we added Metformin 850mg and she can f/u with pcp regarding glucose control, she is on janumet at home this should be held if she is just on metformin (she should call pcp if glucose >200)  #Fever -On [**8-26**] pt developed a low-grade fever.
Workup, which included CDiff toxin assay, CXR, UA, urine culture, blood cultures, and lower extremity noninvasives showed no DVT, no UTI, and slight LLL pulmonary infiltrate but no clinical signs of pneumonia and an improving wbc.
although she had low grade fever on [**8-27**], she was afebrile on the day of discharge and looked clinically well...given that she will be completing a course of cipro/flagyl no other abx were started for the cxr findings.
she should have close follow up with her Pcp if she develops higher fever, cough, dyspnea --recommend outpatient repeat cxr in [**3-9**] weeks to document resolution of infiltrate  Medications on Admission: Aspirin 81 mg PO daily Simvastatin 60 PO QHS Atenolol 12.5 mg PO BID Lisinopril 20 mg PO daily Glipizide 10 mg PO BID Janumet (Sitagliptin/Metformin 50/100 mg) PO BID Vit D [**2153**] units PO daily  Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin, buffered 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
A fluid collection near the pancreas was also found and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] would like to see you in four weeks to perform an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in order to better characterize that fluid collection.
Call your primary care doctor if you fingerstick blood glucose is less than 60 or more than 350.
Your xray showed a small possible pneumonia in the L lung you should have a repeat xray in the next 2-4 weeks with your PCP.
