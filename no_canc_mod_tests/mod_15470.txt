She remained on high-frequency ventilation postoperatively with mean airway pressures of 12 to 14 and amplitudes of 17 to 28.
She was transitioned to conventional ventilation on [**2180-4-27**] after her chest x-ray was reflective of patchy atelectasis and inhomogeneity which might be better treated with conventional ventilation.
She was initially on pressures of 22/6 with a rate of 24, and she is currently on pressures of 22/7 with a rate of 27.
Her most recent capillary gas was reflective of a pH of 7.42, and peak capillary CO2 of 67.
Her calculated bicarbonate was 40.
Her most recent chest x-ray was actually improved versus her previous chest x-rays with less chronic lung changes and much less inhomogeneity without signs of atelectasis.
The current plan is to wean her rate and leave her pressures the same.
Her pressures had been increased by 1 on the positive end-airway pressure and 1 on the positive end-expiratory pressure approximately two days ago secondary to a picture of frequent desaturations.
She has been far more stable since her positive end-expiratory pressure and positive end-airway pressure were increased.
Her electrolytes will be checked frequently during this time of initiation of chlorthiazide therapy and electrolyte supplementation.
Her most recent electrolytes were obtained on [**2180-5-4**] and were significant for a sodium of 133, potassium of 3.4, chloride of 91, and a bicarbonate of 32.
HEMATOLOGIC AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  At the time of her patent ductus arteriosus ligation, baby girl [**Name (NI) 49775**] was completing a 14-day course of amphotericin B as well as ceftazidime secondary to a probable pneumonia with a tracheal aspirate which grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans as well as Morganella morganii.
It was felt by her care team that her temperature lability was secondary environmental factors, and she has had no further episodes of thermal lability and is currently thermal stable in her isolette.
She did have a complete [**Year (4 digits) **] count drawn overnight secondary to her thermal lability, and her complete [**Year (4 digits) **] count was significant for a white [**Year (4 digits) **] cell count of 24,100, a hematocrit of 26.8%, and a platelet count of 412.
Her differential was 54% segs and 0% bands.
As noted above, [**Known lastname 28804**] most recent complete [**Known lastname **] count demonstrated a hematocrit of 26.8%; and as such, she is going to be transfused today 20 cc/kg in two alloclots of 10 cc/kg.
She has had a follow-up head ultrasound on [**2180-4-18**] which was also normal; without signs of intracranial hemorrhage, and another head ultrasound is planned on day of life 60.
She has also had an initial eye examination which was obtained on day of life 39 and was reflective of immature retinae bilaterally.
She is scheduled to have a follow-up eye examination on [**2180-5-10**].
