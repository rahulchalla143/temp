Admission Date:  [**2185-12-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2186-1-4**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times two, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post DDD pacer placement, admitted [**2185-12-22**] with sudden onset of right eye pain at home.
Blood pressure was elevated on admission to 160 to 180.
Neurological examination revealed complete left sided hemiplegia with decreased sensation of the left arm and a left facial droop.
Blood pressures were running in the 120s to 130s.
Speech and swallow evaluation on [**2185-12-23**] recommended nectar thick liquids since the patient was considered to be at aspiration risk.
A repeat head CT on [**12-22**] showed a large right MCA stroke unchanged from prior.
The patient's creatinine was slightly increased from baseline, but her urine output was good.
An increased white blood cell count was noted on [**12-22**] considered to be stress response versus evidence of infection and cultures were sent.
On [**12-23**] systolic blood pressure was running 100 to 110 with the head of the bed at 30 degrees elevation.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.4.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER FROM THE MICU:  Vital signs temperature 98.2.
Pulse 61.
Blood pressure 121/56.
Respiratory rate 20.
Pulse ox 100% on room air.
Cardiovascular, regular, 2 out of 6 systolic murmur best at the right upper sternal border.
Neurological examination the patient's sensation is intact.
Sensation, there is no response to light touch to the left arm.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON TRANSFER FROM INTENSIVE CARE UNIT: Hematocrit 34.9, white blood cell count 10.4, INR 1.1.
Urinalysis showed large blood, negative nitrite, greater then 50 red blood cells, 3 to 5 white blood cells, few bacteria and no epithelial cells.
Sodium 150, potassium 3.5, chloride 110, bicarbonate 32, BUN 39, creatinine 1.5, glucose 350, calcium 8.0, phosphate 32.6, magnesium 2.2, albumin 3.2.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were negative at that time.
The patient's residual defects were a left facial droop, left hemiparesis and left hemisensory deficits.
The blood pressure goal on transfer to the floor was 130s to 140s to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion.
The patient remained intermittently hypotensive and had to be bolused with fluids in order to maintain a blood pressure in the low 100s.
For the latter portion of the patient's admission blood pressure remained stable in the 110s to 120s.
Pulmonary examination and x-ray were consistent with moderate congestive heart failure.
At that time the patient was bolused with 250 cc boluses of normal saline to elevate the blood pressure to the low 100s.
She was ultimately taken off of maintenance hydration and required no further fluid boluses to maintain a blood pressure in the 110s to 120s.
She also maintained good urine output and was considered to be essentially euvolemic with a creatinine at or near baseline of 1.6 at the time of discharge.
On further review of the patient's vital signs and telemetry it was clear that the patient may have been in flutter at least intermittently over the course of two to three days.
After the patient achieves a goal INR of 2 to 3 the patient will be considered for reattempt at cardioversion.
During the latter several days of the admission the patient was taken off intravenous fluids and maintained good po intake to support her blood pressures.
The patient also spiked a fever and while she did grow out positive blood cultures or have positive sputum specimens, chest x-ray was suggestive of a retrocardiac opacity perhaps most consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
Although chest x-ray revealed a persistent left lower lobe opacity at the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile with no new respiratory complaints.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient's fluid status was essentially euvolemic at the time of discharge.
Stool cultures were negative for clostridium difficile.
as starting dose with a goal INR of 2 to 3.
held for systolic blood pressure less then 100.
INR should be maintained at a goal of 2 to 3.
Low dose Coumadin should be continued with potential further adjustment to achieve goal INR of 2 to 3.
At her skilled nursing facility the patient should receive a repeat swallow evaluation as well as physical and occupational therapy.
