Prenatal screens significant for blood type A+, antibody negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, GC negative, chlamydia negative and group beta strep status unknown.
There were variable decelerations noted on ultrasound showing a presenting cord which lead to cesarean delivery under general anesthesia to prevent complications of prolapsed cord.
Cord gas revealed a pH of 7.26, PCO2 of 53 and a PO2 of 35 and a total carbon dioxide of 25.
High inspiratory pressures up to 45 mmHg were required to achieve chest excursion.
Apgars were 2 at 1 minute, 3 at 5 minutes and 5 at 10 minutes of age.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Weight 715 gm (50th percentile), head circumference 53 cm (50th percentile to 75th percentile), length 33 cm (50th to 75th percentile).
Abdominal exam showed a three vessel umbilical cord.
Maximum vent settings - peak inspiratory pressure of 24 with positive end expiratory pressure of 6 and a respiratory rate of 29 with maximum FIO2 requirement of 70%.
Increased CO2s prompted a sleep study per Pulmonary's recommendations which was performed at [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**5-15**].
Her last gas on [**5-14**] - pH 7.33, PCO2 of 68, PO2 of 45, total CO2 of 37 with a base excess of +6.
Her blood pressure has been stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.
An echocardiogram was performed on [**12-30**] to rule out a patent ductus arteriosus.
She had a repeat cardiac echocardiogram on [**4-27**] to rule out pulmonary hypertension.
This was a limited study due to the infant movement, but revealed qualitative good biventricular function, a patent foramen ovale and no PDA.
Hydralazine was started on [**4-20**] for systolic blood pressures consistently greater than 90.
Her blood pressure stabilized and the hydralazine was subsequently discontinued.
Her discharge weight is 4945gm.
Her discharge head circumference is 39.75 cm.
GENITOURINARY:  A renal ultrasound was done on [**4-24**] due to concerns for elevated blood pressure and possible nephrocalcinosis.
The ultrasound showed normal sized kidneys, normal bladder and early minimal nephrocalcinosis.
Her peak bilirubin was on day of life 10 with a total bilirubin of 3.7 and direct bilirubin of 0.2.
HEMATOLOGY:  [**Known lastname 38356**] hematocrit on admission was 37.6.
[**Known lastname **] was started on Epogen on day of life 48 for a hematocrit of 25.
Her last hematocrit on [**5-13**] was 35.5%.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  A complete blood count and blood culture were obtained upon admission.
Her initial complete blood count was unremarkable.
The blood culture at that time was negative.
NEUROLOGY:  Head ultrasounds on [**12-29**], [**1-26**] and [**4-3**] were all normal.
On [**3-21**], her eye exam revealed stage 3, zone 2 bilaterally requiring laser surgery.
Her most recent exam on [**5-16**] revealed regressed retinopathy of prematurity bilaterally and follow up eye exam is recommended in 8 months.
AUDIOLOGY:  A hearing screen was performed with automated auditory brain stem responses and the infant passed in both ears.
CAR SEAT POSITION SCREENING:  A car seat test was performed on [**4-8**] and she passed her car seat screening.
STATE [**Month (only) **] SCREENING STATUS:  The last [**Month (only) 19402**] state screen was sent on [**3-6**].
IMMUNIZATIONS:  [**Known lastname **] received her two month immunizations starting on the [**2-28**] which included her hepatitis B vaccine, her DTP, her IPV and her Pneumococcal vaccine.
Follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37305**] from Pulmonology at [**Hospital3 1810**].
Prematurity at 24 and 4/7th weeks gestation.
