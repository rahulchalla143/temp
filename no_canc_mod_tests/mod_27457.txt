Prenatal labs included BT O+/Ab-, RPR NR, RI, HBsAg-, and GBS-.
No sepsis risk factors were identified at the time of delivery, although meconium-stained amniotic fluid was noted; infant emerged vigorous with Apgars [**9-5**].
Initial blood sugars were low in the 20s, however, and infant was noted to be hypothermic, prompting transfer to NICU.
Of note, placental pathology later revealed a very small placenta with changes suggestive of chronic utero-placental insufficiency.
Weight at birth was 2210 grams (<10%), the length was 44.5 cm (<10%), and head circumference was 32.5 cm (10-25%).
PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE:  Current weight is 3260 grams.
Respiratory breath sounds are equal and clear.
Although overall gradual improvement in blood sugars was noted, with the majority of values being well in the normal range, the persistence of occasional hypoglycemia eventually prompted consultation with the endocrinology and then the metabolism services.
Extensive laboratory evaluations were performed during hypoglycemic periods, with the results largely normal as follows:  - Blood gas normal x 2:  7.40/37, 7.39/32; - Initial lytes normal on [**12-26**]: 139/4.2/106/22, repeat on [**1-8**] with mild metabolic acidosis: 137/4.6/108/15 (not repeated); - Cortisol normal (9); - Growth hormone normal; - Insulin level appropriately low x3 (all values <2 uiu/mL); - Lactate mildly elevated x3:  3.6, 3.9, 4.4 mmol/L, last specimen arterial on [**1-8**]; - Pyruvate normal (0.36); - Ammonia normal (44 mmol/L); - Urine ketones negative x2; - Urine organic acids normal except for elevated 3-hydroxypropionic acid, thought to be insignificant; - Serum amino acid profile with several low values but overall thought to be normal; - Plasma acylcarnitine profile, normal; - Thyroid function tests, normal (TSH 3.8); - Newborn screen metabolic panel, normal x 2.
Formula composition was changed to E28 with 6 calories by enfamil powder and 2 cals by corn oil in an attempt to limit carbohydrates and increase fat intake, without notable improvement in blood sugar stability.
Two additional tests were performed to assess insulin activity: a glucagon challenge, with a rise in blood sugar seen of approximately 30 following glucagon administration, and free fatty acid levels, found to be relatively low at 0.47 mmol/L during a period of hypoglycemia.
Infant has demonstrated excellent weight gain throughout, with weight at discharge of 3.260 kg.
A modest direct hyperbilirubinemia was also noted, with peak direct bilirubin of 2.5 on [**12-25**].
This was attributed to his SGA status, and this gradually improved; last bilirubin level on [**1-8**] was total 3.9 with direct of 1.5.
LFTs were measured on several occasions, and were within normal limits; last were on [**1-8**], with ALT 18, AST 47, and Alk Phos mildly elevated at 506.
HEMATOLOGY:  Hematocrit at birth was 59.7 with a platelet count of 162,000.
The last hematocrit on [**1-3**] was 39.9 with a reticulocyte count of 1.5%.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  CBC and blood cultures were screened on admission to the NICU due to hypoglycemia and hypothermia.
The CBC was within normal limits, blood culture remained negative dates for 48 hours and infant was not started on antibiotic therapy.
Urine for CMV was sent on day of life 2 and this was negative.
NEUROLOGY:  The infant has maintained a normal neurologic exam for gestational age.
AUDIOLOGY:  Hearing screen was performed with audiometric auditory brain response was passed bilaterally.
PSYCHOSOCIAL:  [**Hospital1 18**] Social Worker involved with family.
Feeds at discharge is Enfamil-AR 24 cal's made with     Enfamil-AR 20 cal's with 2 cal's of Enfamil Powder and 2     cal's of corn oil with every three hour feedings.
Family will continue with the current feeding regimen, and will monitor blood sugars twice daily, pre-feeding.
Eventually, as blood sugars remain stable, feeding interval will have to be lengthened and caloric density of feeds will have to be lowered.
