Name:  [**Known lastname 1810**], [**Known firstname 5993**]                    Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 5994**]  Admission Date:                 Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  Service:  ADDENDUM: Pulmonary:  In time, Mr. [**Known lastname **] initial results from the transbronchial biopsy and right lower lobe thoracentesis returned.
Therefore, the decision was to proceed to CT scan guided biopsy of the right lower lobe lung mass and drainage of the right pleural effusion.
Radiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they requested a two week follow-up CT scan of the chest to assess for progression of the right lower lobe lung mass, which was concerning for possible pneumonia / atelectasis / malignancy.
The follow-up CT scan of the chest showed no change in the size of the right lower lobe lung mass.
An enhancement of the pleura suggested possible exudate.
In view of these findings, the Medical team requested Radiology to proceed with biopsy of the right lower lobe lung mass and to drain the fluid on the right side for evaluation of cytology.
To achieve a target INR of 1.3 or less, Mr. [**Known lastname **] received fresh frozen plasma four units and vitamin K 5.0 mg subcutaneous times one.
On [**2-13**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] received his CT scan guided right pleural effusion drainage.
The fluid was negative for malignant cells.
Therefore, the recommendation was to proceed to an FDG nuclear scan of the chest to assess for viability of the right lower lobe lung mass.
If the CT scan would be positive, then consideration for re-biopsy might be pursued.
He would have follow-up with the [**Hospital3 1946**] on [**2119-2-20**], where an INR would be checked and his dosage would be adjusted accordingly.
In terms of Mr. [**Known lastname **]' congestive heart failure, Captopril was continued despite his low blood pressure which hovered in the range of 78 systolic to 92.
Electrocardiograms obtained repeatedly showed no changes and his pressure was relieved by Ativan.
Last INR was 4.4 on [**2-17**].
Follow-up on [**3-1**], for FDG nuclear study on [**Hospital Ward Name **], fourth floor at 10:30 AM.
