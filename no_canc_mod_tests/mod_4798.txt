Recently patient had abnormal exercise stress test and then was referred for a cardiac catheterization which revealed to be vessel disease.
Her physical exam preoperatively is as follows:  Height 5'4", weight 170 pounds.
Vital signs:  Heart rate of 73, BP of 164/81.
Her heart rate is regular rate and rhythm; positive S1, S2; no clicks, rubs, murmurs, or gallops.
Femoral pulses plus 1 bilaterally, dorsalis pedis pulses are plus 2 bilaterally, posterior tibial pulses are plus 2 bilaterally, radial pulses are plus 2 bilaterally.
Carotid duplex was performed on [**2151-12-17**] which revealed no evidence of recurrent left internal carotid artery stenosis.
Preop chest x-ray revealed no acute cardiopulmonary disease, prominent interstitial markings suggesting possible mild fibrotic changes.
Preop EKG showed anterior T-wave changes and inferolateral infarct with age undetermined.
Cardiac echo performed on [**2151-12-17**] showed an ejection fraction of 45 to 50 percent, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, mildly enlarged LA, decreased global systolic function.
Cardiac catheterization performed on [**2152-1-11**] showed RCA stenosis 70 percent, PDA is 50 percent, LAD 75 percent, and her left circumflex 100 percent distally.
Stress MIBI in [**11/2151**] showed positive global ischemia at 2 minutes of mild to moderate reversible ischemia in left circumflex territory.
Preoperative labs were as follows:  White blood count of 8.7, hematocrit of 36.7, platelet count of 264, PT of 12.9, PTT of 24, INR of 1.
Glucose was 89, sodium 141, potassium 3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 25, BUN 21, creatinine 0.6, ALT 23, AST 26, alkaline phosphatase 73, total bilirubin 0.2, total protein 7.7, albumin 4.4, globulin 3.3, hemoglobin A1C was 6.2.
Her vitals at transfer were mean arterial pressure of 81, CVP of 70, PA diastolic of 10, PA mean of 16 with a heart rate of 80 being A-paced.
BP of 109/44, heart rate of 93 being increased still at 96 percent on room air.
Hematocrit was slightly low at 23.7, white count was 9.6.
Her physical exam, besides 1 plus pedal edema, was unremarkable.
Her hematocrit did increase from the 23s to the 25.4.
Discharge physical exam was as follows:  She is alert and oriented with no focal deficits.
Labs at discharge were:  White count of 7, hematocrit 25.4, platelets 197.
Potassium chloride 10 mEq, 2 capsules p.o.
