She had a glucose of 404 for which she received 4 units of insulin with no improvement and was brought to the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room for a concern of possible cerebrovascular accident.
The stroke fellow saw her in the Emergency Room and found her examination showing no evidence of cerebrovascular accident but noticed bradycardia with pauses of up to 4 seconds.
A transvenous pacemaker was introduced through a right IJ Cordis with good capture with a rate of 70.
Diabetes Type 2 on Glyburide 3.
Phone #s include [**Telephone/Fax (1) 29986**] and [**Telephone/Fax (1) 29987**] on her cell phone.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.3, pulse 70, blood pressure 105/37, respiratory rate 19, sating 96% on 3 liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat reveals oropharynx clear, mucous membranes dry and the patient was edentulous.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 39.7, hemoglobin 10.6, hematocrit 31, platelets 576.
Differential, 87 PMNs, 9 bands, 4 lymphs, INR 1.2, PTT 27.7.
Arterial blood gases 7.42/37/89/25.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.8, chloride 100, bicarbonate 20, BUN 21, creatinine 1.5, glucose 392, calcium 9.1, magnesium 1.6, phosphate 4.1, Digoxin 1.2, CK 554, MB fraction 8.
Chest x-ray showed right middle lobe, +/- right lower lobe, pneumonia consistent with aspiration.
After pacemaker was placed, electrocardiogram showed V-paced rhythm at 70, left axis deviation, wide QRS with reciprocal changes and a left bundle branch pattern.
Digoxin level was normal and there was no evidence of ischemia.
The type was [**Company 1543**] Stigma SVR 303, Mode DDD, rate set 60 to 100, serial #[**Serial Number 29988**].
On [**7-15**], the patient did have several runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia but the significance of this without known coronary artery disease and reduced ejection fraction is unknown.
She also had [**7-15**], AM a run of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia with a rate of 100 to 120s which self-terminated and as a result the team increased her atenolol her 50 mg.
She also needed further blood pressure control with systolic blood pressures in the 140s to 160s that day.
CKs dropped with time, MB fractions were never positive and CKs were assumed to be from a long lie and not from a coronary source.
Oxygen was weaned off with good saturations on room air and no shortness of breath, also with resolution of infiltrates, at least partially on post pacemaker films which may indicate a resolving pneumonitis rather than an actual pneumonia.
Renal - Initially high creatinine to 1.5 normalized to .7 with rehydration.
White blood cell count fell from 40 to 20 then to 10 and then to 7.5 at the time of discharge.
For low urine output and concentrated urine, initially she was rehydrated with result of increased clear urine output and normalization of creatinine.
Her multi-infarct dementia would best be preventively managed with aspirin if her presumed allergy is not significant and blood pressure and glucose control and an ACE inhibitor which she is already on.
