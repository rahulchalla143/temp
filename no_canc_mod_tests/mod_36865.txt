He had a stress test in [**2134-5-10**], consistent with average exercise tolerance and his last echocardiogram was in [**2134-2-9**], which showed an ejection fraction over 55 percent.
A bedside ultrasound was consistent with pericardial effusion.
A bedside echocardiogram was performed and consistent with moderate pericardial effusion, left atrial compression, right ventricular flap but no compression, normal flow and ejection fraction with no abnormalities in the left ventricular wall thickness or motion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Primary biliary cirrhosis diagnosed by serologic markers/liver biopsy in [**2132**].
Anemia, baseline hematocrit around 30.0 with MCV around 80, diagnosed as iron deficiency anemia with a ferritin of 6.3 in [**2136-5-10**].
Echocardiogram in [**2134-2-9**], revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction over 55 percent, patent foramen ovale, normal left ventricular wall thickness and motion.
Last stress test in [**2134-5-10**], revealed average functional exercise tolerance without anginal symptoms.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 95, blood pressure 137/66, heart rate 52, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 94 percent on two liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - The pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 6.2, hematocrit 32.3, platelet count 147,000.
Sodium 140, potassium 4.4, chloride 100, bicarbonate 33, blood urea nitrogen 11, creatinine 0.9, glucose 99.
ALT 13, AST 35, alkaline phosphatase 141, total bilirubin 0.6,  CK 107, CK MB 2.0, troponin less than 0.01.
A bedside ultrasound in the Emergency Department was consistent with pericardial effusion and a bedside echocardiogram revealed left atrial compression and a moderate pericardial effusion.
A cardiology consultation was obtained on admission and performed a pericardiocentesis on [**2136-7-2**].
An echocardiogram after 300cc of fluid removed showed a smaller pericardial effusion and ultimately 600cc of bloody serosanguinous fluid that appeared yellow in the tubing was eventually removed with improvement in pericardial and right atrial pressures.
Studies on the pericardial fluid were negative for infection and cytology.
Looking through the previous records, the patient had a previous titre from [**2132-5-10**], of 1:640.
The significance of this is unclear especially given that other workup has been negative.
The patient will be evaluated by a repeat echocardiogram and cardiac surgery is scheduled to remove the chest tube they placed during pericardial window placement.
Primary biliary cirrhosis - The patient is noted to have a history of primary biliary cirrhosis and was asymptomatic with stable liver function tests and coagulation studies throughout his hospitalization.
He had a stable hematocrit throughout his hospitalization and was continued on iron replacement with Vitamin C for improved absorption of iron.
