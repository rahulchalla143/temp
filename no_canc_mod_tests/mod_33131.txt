Differential was 92.3 % neutrophils, 2.0% lymphocytes.
Creatinine was 7.3 with potassium 6.5 and bicarbonate of 7.
TSH 3.61.
She was med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] her initial vitals were T: 85.5, HR: 61 BP: 100/41, RR: 12, O2: 100% on 100% FiO2.
The patient was examined by Surgery, but they did not feel that her physical exam was consistent with a small bowel obstruction.
Per notes, FAST exam was concerning for a pericardial effusion.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further evaluation.

CT Chest [**1-15**] IMPRESSION: 1.
However, culture data was negative.
of right sided pna on cxr, but a CT chest did not demonstrate pneumonia.
CT Head was positive for possible sinus infection, so patient was treated with azithromycin.
No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan to suggest obstruction.
Urine eos negative.
Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] renal function is creatinine = 3.
On CT abdomen, no mediastinal hemorrhage, some peripancreatic stranding, long stretch of dilated bowel (collapsed bowel behind it) potentially consistent with incomplete sbo vs local ileus in the setting of pancreatic inflammation.
Enzymes trended down over course of admission.
Non-contrast head CT was negative for bleed.
EEG negative for seizure.
Urine tox positive for TCAs.
Ostomy output was guaiac positive, but virtually no drop in HCT.
Due to epistaxis and [**Date Range 5348**] altered mental status (see above), pt desated down to 70s on RA, which improved upon deep suctioning of blood clots.
Serial Hcts were 27.0 --> 26.5 (at time of bleeding) --> 29.8 --> 20.7 --> 21.6.
