WBC increased to 27k since [**7-30**].
Blood cx x 2 negative at that time, and CTA negative for PE.
A CT of the abdomen on admission demonstrated mild sigmoid colonic wall thickening with adjacent fat stranding.
A CXR demonstrated bilateral patchy airspace disease concerning for edema/infection, and subsequent CXR was concerning for a LLL infiltrate.

CT abd: There has been interval development of a short focal segment of mild bowel wall thickening involving the sigmoid colon with subtle adjacent fatty stranding.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) leukocytosis/UTI/?colitis: The patient was admitted to internal medicine for evaluation and treatment of her UTI and her ?colitis seen on her CT abdomen.
Her urine culture from [**8-7**] then came back growing Pseudomonas Aeruginosa sensitive to ceftazidime as well as enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin.
MICU TRANSFER: On the morning of [**8-16**], the patient was noted to have a WBC jump from 24 to 30, with low systolic pressure down to 80s-90s, as well as hypoxia at 88% on 3L (increased from her baseline of 2L), necessitating NRB.
A lactate was 4.2.
She was placed on BiPap 10/5 with 80% FiO2, but ABG was 7.3/34/112 - A-a gradient 275.
A CXR showed worsening CHF and persistent LLL opacity.
She had an abdominal x-ray which showed a vague increased density over the bladder of unclear significance, without apparent free air or obstruction.
A stat echo showed normal LV function with marked dilitation of the right ventricular cavity as well as severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis and 4+ TR.
PE was considered, however the patient was too unstable to have a CTA, and the echo result was not significantly changed from prior echo subsequent to which a CTA had been negative for PE.
In this setting, her HR and BP continued to trend down, and attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation in this setting were deemed futile.
The patient had bibasilar crackles in the ED, and was given Lasix 40mg IV x1 with good urine output response.
However, the patient subsequently became hypotensive and required 250cc boluses x3 with improvement to BPs of 90s over palp.
The patient's blood pressures remained low throughout her stay, and her CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.
It was decided that a blood transfusion would improve bother her anemia as well as her intravascular volume status, and so a transfusion on 1u PRBC was given, with improvement of SBP to the low 100s.
Per previous echocardiogram reports, the patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, and so is likely preload dependent and difficult to keep her lung exam from seeming wet.
