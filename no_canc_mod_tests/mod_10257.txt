The mother's prenatal screens are blood type B positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis surface antigen negative, and group B strep unknown.
She was admitted the day prior to delivery with a fever of 104, this morning became hypothermic, with a temperature of 94.
The mother's blood cultures were growing listeria species.
Apgars were 7 at one minute and 8 at five minutes.
Her birth weight was 1425 grams, birth length was 41 cm, and birth head circumference was 29.5 cm.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Admission physical examination reveals a pre-term infant in moderate respiratory distress.
Respiratory:  The infant initially started on nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure and, at approximately 13 hours of age, required endotracheal intubation for work of breathing after her chest x-ray was consistent with hyaline membrane disease.
The intubation was difficult, and a chest x-ray after intubation showed a pneumomediastinum without evidence of pneumothorax, suggesting the possibility of perforation of the pharynx.
A follow-up x-ray approximately eight hours later showed that the pneumomediastinum had resolved, but there was a question of air present in the right side of the neck.
A follow-up x-ray on day of life three showed clear lung fields.
Her last venous blood gas on [**2143-6-13**] had a pH of 7.29, and a CO2 of 41.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  She is on parenteral nutrition.
Her total fluids are 160 cc/kg/day.
Her last set of electrolytes on [**2143-6-13**] were sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 107, and bicarbonate 19.
Her urine output is approximately 6 cc/kg/hour, with a urine pH of 7.5.
Her peak bilirubin occurred on day of life number two, and that was total 8.7, direct 0.4.
A follow-up bilirubin on day of life number three was total 6.9, direct 0.4.
Hematology:  Her hematocrit at the time of admission was 47.2, with a follow up on day of life number at 40.8.
At that time, her complete blood count was unremarkable.
Her white count was 12,000, with a differential of 30 polys and 0 bands.
Platelets were 349,000.
A follow-up CBC on [**2143-6-11**] had a white blood cell count of 13.9, with a differential of 59 polys and 3 bands and 24 lymphs, and a platelet count of 414,000.
A spinal tap done prior to the beginning of antibiotics had a white blood cell count of 10, red blood cell count of 1675, protein 174, and a glucose of 38.
Her cerebrospinal fluid and blood cultures remained negative to date.
Gentamicin levels done after the third dose were a trough of 1.3, and a peak of 7.8.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The infant is being transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] for a swallow study to rule out a pharyngeal tear.
Parenteral nutrition of total fluids 160 cc/kg/day of 10% dextrose with 3 grams/kg/day of protein and 1.5 grams/kg/day of 20% interlipids with 2 mEq/100 cc of sodium and 1 mEq/100 cc of potassium.
A state screen was sent on [**2143-6-14**].
