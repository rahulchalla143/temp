IMAGING: [**10-15**] CT Head: Overall unchanged appearance of hemorrhagic contusions in bilateral frontal lobes, with subdural, subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage which has been slightly decreased.
The pulmonary artery  systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-10-7**], the findings are  similar.
MICROBIOLOGY: [**2197-10-19**] 11:27 am BLOOD CULTURE      Source: Venipuncture.
[**10-31**] Blood Cx x 2: NGTD .
He was restarted on hydralazine 25mg PO q 6hr, his Labetolol was increased to 600mg PO TID and his was restarted on Amlodipine 5 mg.  His blood pressures were noted to be lower than goal.
-- While on the floor, his regimen was optimized and his pressures were well controlled.
-- Goal BP is 120 - 160.
#) MENTAL STATUS + SDH/SAH: -- Repeat head CT on admission showed no change in the SAH/SDH from the end of [**Month (only) 216**].
His urine cultures were negative, and while there was a LLL opacity on CXR, his osycgen saturations were in the high 90's and he did not have a cough suggesting a PNA that would lead to MSSSa bacteremia.
TTE was negative for vegetations.
-- Surveillance cultures were followed and negative.
CXR was repeated twice (once on [**10-31**] and once on [**11-2**]), and there was no evidence of worsening or new PNA.
-- Although no source was ever clearly identified, it was reassuring that he was clinically improving in terms of his delirium and his vital signs were stable.
#) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: -- His baseline Cr was 0.8 and had bumped to 2.5 on [**10-25**].
-- As Na had normalized, fluid restrictions were lifted and he was volume resuscitated.
-- Ultimatley, it was thought that he had ATN from labile blood pressures, and his Creatinine has been slowly improving.
#) BPH: -- His outpatient regimen of Detrol, Finasteride, and Tamsulosin was discontinued in the setting of delirium, as all non-critical meds were discontinued.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Labetalol 200 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours): Please hold if systolic blood pressure is less than 120 or pulse is less than 60. .
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
Followup Instructions: (1) Please see your primary care doctor in 1 - 2 weeks to check renal function and overall clinical status.
You also have an appointment at 1:30 pm on [**2197-11-14**] for a CT scan of the head.
Pending serum sodium levels remain normal, please encourage PO fluid intake with assistance for aspiration precautions.
If creatinine does increase and the patient seems dry (being discharged at 2.0), please begin IV fluids.
(2) Please make sure systolic blood pressures [**Last Name (un) 7387**] between 120 - 160. .
