She was first seen for evaluation of her liver disease in [**State 4565**] and [**State 8780**] in [**2124-5-21**].
In mid [**Month (only) **] her INR was 1.6 (peaked at 2.0), bilirubin was 23 and her transaminases were 300-400.
Her WBC count was 6.8, hct 31.2, platelets 125, total bilirubin 23, AST 441, ALT 306 Alkaline phosphatase 297, albumin 2.5, INR 1.6.
Her electrolytes were within normal limits.
Her lipase was 367.
Her hepatitis B surface angigen, hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis A IgG and IgM were negative.
She underwent a liver biopsy on [**2124-6-13**] which showed reactive hepatocytes, cholestasis, and inflammatory infiltrate.
The biopsy was felt to be consistent with autoimmune hepatitis, drug reaction or extra-hepatic obstruction.
She was started on immuran and prednisone on [**2124-6-21**] for presumed autoimmune hepatitis with plans to also undertake an MRCP to assess for sclerosing cholangitis.
Between [**2124-6-21**] and [**2124-7-14**] her total bilirubin decreased from 21 to 17 (direct 9.8) with a decrease in her transaminases to AST 176 and ALT 223 with alkaline phosphatase of 213.
Lipase at that time was 595 and INR was 1.7.
There are no additional laboratory values between then and her admission here on [**2124-9-14**] although per the patient's family she was under the care of a naturopath while in [**Location (un) 86**] in [**Month (only) 216**] who was administering a number of naturopathic supplements (including iron) to help with her liver disease, and laboratory work was taken.
In the field, she had a HR of 120s and was breathing spontaneously.
A CT of head, by report, demonstrated a left frontal mass and left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
A repeat head CT confirmed the above findings.
Autoimmune hepatitis - Diagnosed [**2124-5-21**].
Bronchitis 3. per report, evaluated at [**Doctor Last Name 21721**] for arthritis in [**2124-4-20**]   Social History: Patient lives in [**State 8780**] and was visiting family members in [**Name2 (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
Reflexes 3+ right patella, 2+ left, 3+ bilaterally at bicesp.

[**9-14**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage, with new mass, seizure, [**Month/Year (2) 4656**] for interval change and please compare with outside hospital CT.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired contiguous axial images of the head were obtained without intravenous contrast.
In addition there is bilateral fronto- parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage without significant midline shift This is not significantly changed since the study at 5:30 a.m. from the same date.
An MRI would be more sensitive for assesment of the left frontal lesion.
[**9-14**] MRI OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, [**2124-9-14**]; MRA OF THE HEAD, [**2124-9-14**]  INDICATION: 60-year-old woman with new intracranial mass, hemorrhage, and seizures.
TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain was performed with axial gradient echo, T2- weighted, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted sequences.
Additionally, multiplanar pre- and post-gadolinium T1-weighted sequences were obtained.
MRA was performed with 3D time-of-flight imaging through the head.
COMPARISON: Head CT of [**2124-9-14**].
Subarachnoid hemorrhage, as see on the recent CT. 3.
[**2124-9-19**] EEG: FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Focal and lateralized slowing was noted toward the end of the record with 1-2 Hz slower theta and faster delta from the left mid-temporal, central, posterior temporal, and parietal regions.
The anterior-posterior voltage gradient was not preserved.
[**2124-10-3**] Echocardiogram The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-9-20**], the localized lucency in near the crux of the heart is likely a coronary artery.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted breath-hold independent imaging was performed on a 1.5 Tesla magnet, including dynamic sequential images obtained prior to, during, and after the uneventful administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium-DTPA.
COMPARISON: Correlation is made with abdominal ultrasound dated [**2124-10-3**] and abdominal CT dated [**2124-9-18**].
Spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenals are grossly normal, allowing for limitations of non-breath-hold technique.
IMPRESSION: Morphologic changes and diffuse abnormal signal throughout the liver, in keeping with hepatitic fibrosis.
[**2124-10-9**]: VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW STUDY  The study was performed in conjunction with the speech pathology department.
A single episode of frank aspiration, which was silent was demonstrated during straw sip administration of thin liquid barium consistency which appeared to improve with chin tuck maneuvers.
Focused examination of the vocal cords was not possible as no phonation was able to be elicited from the patient.
[**2124-10-10**]: MRI Head IMPRESSION:  1.
[**2124-10-11**] CXR (AP) FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-5**], the patient has taken a much better inspiration.

Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**] respectively.
Initial imaging revealed small SAH and large mass, likely abscess with several satellite lesions.
Serial head CT?????
EEG was not suggestive of convulsive status.
Repeat LP and blood cultures all show no growth.
ID recommends 6 week course then repeat head MRI to reassess.
CTA was negative for fistula.
Repeat bronchoscopy after latest episode of hemoptysis on [**10-5**] found a bleeding lesion in the trachea, which was coagulated with good hemostasis.
Since then, there have been no repeat episodes and her hematocrit and respiratory status have remained largely stable.
All cell counts stable at time of discharge.
Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease.
During her stay had an elevation most notable in alk phos as well as a mild elevation in transaminases which are again trending down.
There was concern that her autoimmune hepatitis could be returning, but the team was hesitant to start her on any immunosupressive therapies given the severe comorbid infection in this patient.
Hepatology recommended a MRCP, which showed findings c/w cirrhosis, as well as some ascites.
A B-glucan test was positive and pt was transiently treated with amphotericin.
Fungal cultures of blood and CSF were persistently negative and this was discontinued.
Of note, her creatinine has consistently been 0.4-0.6.
Potassium was repleted daily.
A TTKG calculated [**10-12**] was 10.33, which was inconsistent with the measured hypokalemia and suggestive of renal losses.
The patient's potassium will need close monitoring and repletion.
On discharge she was ordered for 60 mEq of potassium [**Hospital1 **] but this dose will likely need to be adjusted and would recommend [**Hospital1 **]-TID potassium monitoring.
When the patient had a swallow study on [**2124-10-6**], there was concern for aspiration, so a video swallow study was scheduled for [**2124-10-9**].
On day of discharge [**Known firstname 12705**] vital signs are stable, she has no oxygen requirement.
"Naturopath" supplements started in [**2124-7-21**]: (from the D'Adamo Institute) Formula O, B6-B2, B12-B2, Folic Acid, C, Iron, Selenium, Liver, cod liver oil, NAC, Bonerneal/Support, Pancreas, Chromium, Zinc, Magnesium & Zinc, Adrenal, Potassium, Whey Protein Powder, Psyllium Seed Blend, Stractan, Flax seed oil, Kidney herbal tea, Liver disease/cc/stomac 601, licorice solid extract, Bronchial drops, boswellia.

You had a head CT and lumbar puncture which showed that you had an infection around your brain.
You will need to have an MRI of your brain performed prior to stopping antibiotics to ensure that your infection has been appropriately treated.
