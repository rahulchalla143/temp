Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
[**2100-1-7**] Echocardiogram Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
There are no definitive signs of tamponade however the presence of atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension may mean that echo signs of tamponade are absent.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-1-5**], the right atrium does not appear to have sustained collapse on the current study.
TTE showed signs of early tamponade vs hypovolemia with RA collapse.
Repeat TTE on [**2100-1-7**] was stable.
We discussed his case with his outpatient rheumatologist and oncologist to consider RA and MGUS with possible progression myseloma as etiologies.
A serum free ligth chain assay was sent and was pending at the time of discharge.
ESR was 102 and CRP was >300, the upper limit measurable by the assay.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine peaked at 1.6, may be secondary to RA or due to poor renal perfusion due to atrial fibrillation.
Creatinine trended down prior to discharge.
Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase normal.
He was also restarted on coumadin starting [**1-7**], and will require close INR monitoring as an outpatient.
He will followup with caerdiology as an outpatient and may benefit from repeat stress imaging following resolution of his current medical problems.
He will need outpatient followup with rheumatolgoy regarding his prednisone taper and further managemtn of his rheumatoid arthritis 2.
Your heart rate was also fast and you needed to increase your metoprolol and was started on amiodarone, a medicine that will decrease your heart rate and also may convert the atrial fibrillation back to a regular rhythm.
You will need to have your coumadin level checked on [**2101-1-12**].
Start taking amiodarone to slow your heart rate 2.
Discontinue Atenolol, take metoprolol twice daily instead to slow your heart rate 4.
