Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %).
Taken to the OR for TEE where he was severely acidotic, with a mixed venous sat of 15.Echo showed poor cardiac function, and he was hypoxic.
Decision made for surgical salvage attempt, and he underwent emergency replacement of ascending and hemi arch aorta/AVR.Unable to be weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass, despite maximal pressor support, bronchoscopy and pulmonary consult.
