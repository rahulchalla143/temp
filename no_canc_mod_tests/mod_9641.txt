The patient was discontinued from nasal C-PAP to room air 36 hours prior to transfer.
Infectious Disease:  The patient had an initial CBC that showed neutropenia (wbc 5.7 - 3 neutrophils, 2 bands, ANC = 285).

It was a traumatic tap with excessive number of red blood cells and white blood cells making it difficult to interpret.

The culture and Gram stain on all of the LP's were negative.
The initial culture on the first LP is no growth and final and the others are no growth and pending.
It was decided, based on the patient's clinical course, abnormal CBCs, the unreliability of the cultures and the disproportionate white to red blood cell count in the spinal fluid to treat for possible meningitis.
