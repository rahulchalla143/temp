Two weeks prior to admission, her FEV1 was found to be 0.36 and her FVC 1.13.
Her blood gas revealed a pH of 7.26, carbon dioxide of 65 and O2 of 95 so as a result she was emergently intubated.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 98.9 F.; blood pressure 127/81; pulse 110; saturation of 100% on assist control of 600 by 8 with 8 of PEEP and 40% FIO2.
Cardiac examination revealed a normal S1, S2, at a tachycardic rate, no audible rubs, murmurs or gallops.
Neurologically, the patient was a little somnolent but otherwise the examination was non-focal and benign.
LABORATORY:  On admission notable for a white blood cell count of 16.1, hematocrit of 41, platelets 310, BUN 16, creatinine 0.7, bicarbonate 27.
Chest x-ray demonstrated hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms but no signs of any focal infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
Over time, it was attempted to wean her from the ventilator, but unfortunately as her pressure support was decreased to minimal levels, the patient would become desynchronous with the ventilator, requiring immediate paralysis for ventilation.
An EMG was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of critical care polyneuropathy.
Because it took a while for the patient's mental status to return to baseline off of all sedation, a head CT scan was performed to evaluate for any signs of an acute hypoxia.
Fortunately, the CT scan confirmed the presence of a pan-sinusitis but no acute cerebral injury.
The patient's renal function remained excellent throughout her hospital stay with occasional episodes of oliguria which responded well to fluid boluses.
Iron studies were checked and were found to be consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
A hemolysis work-up was completely negative.
Her electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and were repleted as needed.
