Upon arrival to the OSH, he was intubated and received ceftriaxone, ativan, versed and paralytics; head CT was obtained and was reported as "bilateral occipital strokes."

CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAPHY [**2-26**]: PROCEDURE: Following informed consent from the patient's wife, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table.
A preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure and site.
A solution of TPA of 1 mg/mL was then administered in divided doses of 1 mg each.
Angiography through the microcatheter was performed at various intervals during the administration of thrombolytic to assess for progress of thrombolysis and for any residual thrombus.
Findings of this angiogram demonstrated that the patient was a suitable candidate for and may benefit from angioplasty.
Angiography post-angioplasty was performed.
At this stage based on the findings of the angiogram and on discussion with the Neurology and Neurosurgical Services, it was decided to stop treatment.
The sheath was left in place for the administration of TPA and because the Clinical Service required invasive arterial monitoring for blood pressure.
Based on the findings of this post-procedure angiogram and discussion with the Neurology and Neurosurgical Services and review of the preprocedure MRI, it was decided that further transcatheter therapy was not indicated and thus the procedure was stopped.
IMPRESSION: Complete occlusion of the mid basilar artery extending to the basilar tip was treated with a combination of pharmacologic and mechanical thrombolysis (a total of 19 mg of TPA was utilized).
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54747**] [**Name (STitle) **] DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  POST-ANGIO CT [**2-26**]: Non-contrast head CT.
FINDINGS: Today's examination demonstrates decompressed lateral ventricles due to a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: 33 yo male with no sig PMH except some chronic abdominal pain (13 hr history) presented as a transfer from OSH after being found unresponsive, head CT showing "bilateral occipital lobe infarcts" and cerebellar infarcts.
At 7AM on [**2-26**], he underwent cerebral angiography and received 19 mg TPA to the site of the clot as well as balloon angio, with recanalization of basilar artery, but persistent occlusion of left PCA.
Stat head CT performed just following the procedure showed extravasation of contrast/blood, subarachnoid blood around brainstem into 4th ventricle, and swelling of posterior fossa.
Following the procedure, exam off propofol and paralytics showed absent brainstem reflexes with pupils 5-6 mm and unreactive, no corneals, no gag, no nasal tickle, could not assess OCR because hard collar in place; there was trace tripleflexion versus withdrawal to nox stim in lower extremities, absent movement to noxious stimulation in the upper extremities, trace DTRs and mute toes.
He was evaluated further by neurosurgery who felt he was not a surgical candidate as exam suggested brain death (though with recent propofol and paralytics, he could not definitively be considered brain dead at this time).
Mannitol was continued, with close monitoring of electrolytes and osms.
At 11AM, in accordance with the patient's family's wishes, brain death exam was performed and confirmed brain death via absent brainstem reflexes, including absent response to cold calorics, failed apnea test with rise in PCO2 from 35 to 69 within just 5 minutes of no ventillation (with 100%fio2 supplementation).
