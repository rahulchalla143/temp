Initial CK was 200,000.
Her urine output began to increase to around 300 cc per day at discharge.
Iron studies and hemolysis studies were nondiagnostic.
Hemolysis lab was positive with low haptoglobin and high LDH and high reticulocyte count.
Peripheral smears showed only mild hemolysis.
Since her LDH was trending down and her haptoglobin was obtained after transfusion and her Coombs was negative, this was thought not to be hemolysis.
Patient has been repeatedly guaic negative and her bimanual vaginal exam was negative.
Her hematocrit was stable above 27 for 48 hours before discharge without transfusion.
The patient was found to have a TSH of 22 and free T4 of 0.8, which suggests hypothyroidism.
