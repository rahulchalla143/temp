LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Biventricular systolic function is preserved and all other findings are consistent with pre-CPB findings.
