Clinical correlation is suggested  Echocardiogram [**2142-11-7**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2142-11-8**] 1.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right-sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 13 mmHg, and moderately elevated left-sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 20 mmHg.
There was severe systemic systolic hypertension with central aortic pressure of 167/70, mean 107 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.8 L/min/m2 (using an  assumed O2 consumption).
Initial troponin T was elevated at 0.41, with normal CK-MB and EKG suggestive of previous infarct.
Transthoracic echocardiogram of suboptimal image quality showed normal overall and regional biventricular systolic function (LVEF >60%), mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic stenosis, and a small pericardial effusion.
She was given vitamin K 5 mg PO, and INR fell to 1.5.
Her Hct fell from 27.8 to a nadir of 21.6, treated with transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells with appropriate increase in her hematocrit.
Her hematocrit remained stable and was 24.5 at the time of discharge.
# Congestive Heart failure: Patient appeared euvolemic on physical examination on admission.
She was noted to have an elevated BNP of 745 at [**Hospital1 **], suggestive of congestive heart failure.
Cardiac catheterization showed LVEDP and PCW of 20 mm Hg, consistent with isolated diastolic heart failure of uncertain duration.
She was monitored on telemetry without any evidence of atrial fibrillation.
She had a supratherapeutic INR on admission with an INR which peaked at 4.0.
Her INR was 1.4 at the time of the procedure.
At the time of discharge her INR was 1.1.
She will follow-up with her PCP regarding INR [**Hospital1 7941**] and titration of her Coumadin dosing.
# Acute on Chronic CKD: Per report, patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 2.0.
On admission, her creatinine was elevated to 2.1.
Her creatinine trended upward to a maximum of 2.6 prior to her coronary angiogram.
She was given a total of 1.5 liters of bicarbonate in D5W with improvement in creatinine to a nadir of 2.1.
Post catheterization creatinine increased slightly but remained stable at 2.3.
# UTI: The patient was noted to have a urine culture with > 10,000 colonies of  E. coli at [**Hospital3 **].
Repeat UA/Cx here on [**11-5**] showed mixed bacteria consistent with skin contamination.
Blood pressures improved, and the drip was discontinued.
STABLE ISSUES # Hypothyroid:  The patient was continued on her home levothyroxine  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Patient will follow-up with PCP regarding INR [**Hospital1 7941**] and adjustment of her Coumadin dosing.
Calcium with Vitamin D 600 mg(1,500mg) -400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
The procedure could not happen right away because your INR was elevated.
You underwent a catheterization which showed a blockage of one of the arteries in your heart.
You were sent to the ICU for close [**Hospital3 7941**] and given a blood transfusion.
Your creatinine levels were initially elevated, indicating reduced kidney function.
You should follow-up with your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7941**] of your INR and further changes in your coumadin dose.
