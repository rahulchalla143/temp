Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2126-1-2**] at 11:13 Test: TEE (Complete) Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler Contrast: None Tape Number: 2007AW2-: Test Location: Anesthesia West OR cardiac Technical Quality: Adequate     REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *5.6 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.3 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 0.7 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)  Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.7 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: *7.9 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 4.8 cm Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: 0.39 (nl >= 0.29) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 25% to 30% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 2.8 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *3.6 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aortic Valve - Valve Area: *2.4 cm2 (nl >= 3.0 cm2)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  Considering known global hypokinesis and history of two abn valves, has decided to proceed with intraoperative TEE in the setting of prior partial gastrectomy.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior - hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal inferior - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex - hypo; apex - hypo;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Bloody secretions necessitated bronchoscopy which was done that evening.
Neuro eval done to follow his prior CVA.
