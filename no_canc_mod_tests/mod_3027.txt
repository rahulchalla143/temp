Of note, patient was recently admitted from [**5-29**] to [**2120-5-31**] to [**Hospital1 18**] c/o rapid palpitations due to atrial tachycardia with HR 15-150.
Her BPs remained stable for fisrt 3 hours of the case and then subsequently became hypotensive with SBPs in the 90s.

Since the previous tracing of [**2120-6-10**] the rhythm as [**Date Range 4030**] has replaced atrial fibrillation.
ECG ([**6-10**]): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo F with atrial flutter s/p multiple cardioversions and pulmonary vein isolation in [**9-/2119**] who presented for repeat pulmonary vein isolation.
In the cath [**Year (4 digits) **], she was started on phenylephrine for pressure support and she was given 3L of NS and then 20 mg IV lasix with 1L of urine output.
In the CCU, the pt was mentating well, her hematocrit was stable, she had no signs of infection, and she maintained good urine output so pressors were weaned the same evening.
On transfer to the floor on [**6-11**], her blood pressures were recorded to be in the mid 70s systolic though pt was asymptomatic at the time and again showed no signs of infection or acute blood loss.
#Atrial flutter/fibrillation - Pt is s/p multiple cardioversions and a previous pulmonary vein isolation and she presented for repeat pulmonary vein isolation.
ECG at the time showed atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.
Her blood pressures remained stable and the patient was otherwise asymptomatic.
She received 5mg IV Lopressor, 50mg PO Lopressor and 40mg PO verapamil with some improvement of her rate but no conversion of her rhythm.
Patient was discharged on quinidine; her beta-blocker and CCB were held in the setting of her low blood pressures (again though this is likely pt's baseline) and she was given [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor and was instructed to follow-up with EP.
