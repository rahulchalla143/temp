At [**Hospital1 **], he was noted to have a blood pressure of 168/107 with an INR of 2.3.
CT scan of the abdomen revealed a right adrenal hemorrhage.
His INR was corrected with 6 units of fresh frozen plasma and 2.5 mg of Vitamin K, which brought it down to 1.4.
His hematocrit dropped from 41 to 28; the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
His hematocrit was subsequently stable in the low 30s.
Repeat CT scan on [**6-24**], revealed no change in the size of the hemorrhage.
The patient's blood pressures typically run at approximately 180/120 at home.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a blood pressure of 180/83; pulse of 71; respiratory rate of 24; saturation 92% on room air; he was afebrile.
LABORATORY:  On transfer, the patient had a white blood cell count of 7.6, hematocrit of 32.3, platelet count of 108.
He had a sodium of 137, potassium of 3.8, chloride of 101, CO2 of 27, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.6, glucose of 81.
He had a magnesium of 1.9, phosphate of 3.4, albumin of 3.4 and INR of 1.2.
PTT of 33.3.
He had an EKG which revealed normal sinus rhythm at 80.
Chest x-ray revealed no evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
He had a renal ultrasound which revealed a right kidney mildly enlarged but with normal echo texture.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 69 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair, and renal cell carcinoma status post left nephrectomy, who presents with a right adrenal hemorrhage in the setting of an INR of 2.3.
He subsequently had an MRI of his abdomen to evaluate for possible mass abutting the adrenal gland.
The MRI revealed a focal collection consistent with the previously noted hemorrhage.
Our initial goal was a systolic blood pressure of approximately 150 mm of Mercury given the patient's baseline systolic blood pressure of 180 mm of Mercury.
Toward the end of his hospital stay, we gently titrated up the Labetalol in order to maximize blood pressure control.
However, given his recent hemorrhage, he is not currently a candidate for the anti-coagulation necessary for this procedure, therefore, we will control his blood pressure with oral agents and he will follow as an outpatient for further management of his renal artery stenosis.
He had a lower extremity ultrasound which revealed dilatation of the right common femoral artery to 2.4 cm with an atheromatous plaque within.
