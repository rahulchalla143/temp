In the ED she was febrile to 102.8, normotensive, and leukopenic (~2.5) with lactate elevated to 6.6.
UA showed UTI.

Reassessment of the foley catheter and urine output is recommended.

IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED FROM ANAEROBIC BOTTLE.
Sepsis protocol ws initiated, with fluid bolus prn (titrated to urine output), Levophed started to keep MAP>65.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stimulation test returned with elevated baseline cortisol at 44, with poor response (48 at 60 minutes), and she was started on HC and FC.
An infectious work-up was initiated pre-abx, remarkable for +U/A with alkalotic pH (history of Proteus UTI).
Foley was changed, with good urine outputBlood cultures subsequently grew GNR 4/4 bottles (cx from [**8-21**]), identified at E coli, sensitive to cephalosporins and gent.
CXR wihtout acute CP process.
Culture of the femoral line tip was negative.
The patient was afebrile for several days prior to discharge, and her WBC count was decreasing.
Blood cultures remained positive until [**2140-8-22**].
Cultures drawn on [**2140-8-24**] were pending at the time of discharge but had no growth to date.
Urine culture on [**8-27**] grew pseudomonas which was pan-resistant, but only 10-100,000/mL so we did not treat this.
If the patient is symptomatic, a UA and Urine culture should be repeated at the nursing home.
EKG on admission with lateral ST depressions, ruled out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes (CK rose from 50-->375, with trop <0.01 to peak 0.09, then trending down.
When INR decreased <2, a heparin drip was started for anticoagulation.
Anemia: Transfused 1U PRBCs [**8-22**] for hct 27.9.
Hct increased to 32.9.
Hct was stable after that point.
Hct drop likely was dilutional in the setting of large volume IV fluid resuscitation.
However, successful bedside informal swallow evaluation was done prior to discharge.
Warfarin Sodium 1 mg Tablet Sig: Four (4) Tablet PO once a day: need to check INR blood test in [**4-26**] days and adjust dose accordingly for goal INR [**2-25**].
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Hollywell - [**Location (un) 5110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: urinary tract infection bacteremia, E. coli, likely urosepsis atrial fibrillation coronary artery disease anemia, stable chronic foley for urinary retention history of CVA   Discharge Condition: stable, tolerating POs, baseline L-hemiparesis   Discharge Instructions: contact MD if you develop fever/chills, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or other concerning symptoms  A urine culture on [**8-27**] grew pseudomonas which was pan-resistant, but only 10-100,000/mL so we did not treat this.
If the patient is symptomatic, a UA and Urine culture should be repeated at the nursing home.
Followup Instructions: follow-up with primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 2-4 weeks  Urine culture on [**8-27**] grew pseudomonas which was pan-resistant, but only 10-100,000/mL so we did not treat this.
If the patient is symptomatic, a UA and Urine culture should be repeated at the nursing home.
