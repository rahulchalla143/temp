Pt was asked to come to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
On arrival, evaluation showed that she had a very tender uterus with poor relaxation and non-reassuring fetal heart tracing.
Intraop concern was for DIC and her INR returned at 1.4; she was given 1 unit of cryo.
After the procedure,in recovery room, her Hct dropped from 26.8 to 17.7 and she developed coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.
LFTs were notable for an AST in the mid 40s, with a nl ALT less than 10.
Chem 7 showed K 6.6, Cr 2.0, HCO3 21.

[**4-18**]: ECHO 1.
Left ventricle normal overall, with left ventricular systolic function >55%.
[**4-22**]: CT ABD/PELVIS: IMPRESSION: no retroperitoneal hematoma, uterine cavity with material c/w post c/s.
Cardiac echo x 2 showed good EF (>55%).
The pt was found to be in pulmonary edema, was placed on BiPAP, and was intubated on [**4-20**] after failing BiPAP.
CXR [**4-25**] showed resolving pulmonary edema, and the pt underwent aggressive pulmonary toilet w/ incentive spirometry.
Her O2 sats on the floor were subsequently normal on RA.
Fibrinogen was 100 with PTT 40.6, INR 1.8 early in course and improved with 1 unit Cryo and 1 unit FFP, now with nml coags and fibrinogen.
Smear with 1 schisto per HPF, more c/w DIC than TTP/HUS.
HTN, r/o preeclampsia - 1+ proteinuria but LFTs overall wnl, with no sx of H/A or vision changes.
Due to her RUQ pain, she underwent non-contrast CT on POD#6 which showed no evidence of liver hematoma or pericapsular bleed.
CV: Cardiac echos were performed [**4-18**] and [**4-25**].
EF was normal >55%, mild mitral regurg was seen on initial echo, but improved on repeat echo to "trivial" MR.
Moderate pulmonary edema was seen on both cardiac echo's, and per medicine consult, the pt should have follow-up echo as an outpatient to monitor pulmonary edema.
Her TSH prior to d/c was elevated 5.5, but T3 100 and free T4 1.2 were WNL.
