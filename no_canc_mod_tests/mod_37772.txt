In ED, EKG showed S1/Q3/T3 pattern.
HR was sinus tachy to the 130's and SBP was in the 140's.
A CTA was done showing extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli (left mainstem with sub total occ; right mainstem sub total occ).

CTA showed impressive bilateral PEs.
Echo showed R heart strain with marked dilatation of the R ventricle, severe global right ventricular free wallhypokinesis, and abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVT, making SVC filter unnecessary.
He is up to date in age-appropriate cancer screening and seems to have no risk factors for hypercoagulability; therefore, Mr.R would benefit from an outpatient hypercoagulability work-up.
As well, given his right heart strain, he should have a follow-up echocardiogram one week and 3 months after discharge.
Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 838**] in one week for a repeat echocardiogram and hypercoaguability work-up.
Please have a second repeat echocardiogram in 3 months.
