RADIOLOGY: CXR [**2178-8-17**]: .
TEE [**2178-3-26**] - The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is about 25 to 30%.
TTE [**2178-3-19**] - No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium or right atrium.
There are catheters in the right atrium, right ventricle and coronary sinus which are all free of masses or vegetations.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %).
Compared to prior study dated [**2178-2-13**], the amount of mitral regurgitation is slightly worse.

Imaging: CT abd/pelvis ([**2178-8-17**]): 1.
Echo ([**2178-8-19**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-2-10**], the left ventricular systolic function has further deteriorated.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to evaluate the valves and the ascending aorta .
CT torso ([**2178-8-22**]): 1.
Right foot Xray ([**2178-8-22**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-11**], there has apparently been resection of the distal half of the fifth metatarsal.
RHC ([**9-4**]): COMMENTS: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.2 l/min/m2.
LHC/RHC/renal angiogram ([**9-14**]): COMMENTS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 20 mmHg and mean PCWP of 26 mmHg.
There was a normal cardiac index of 2.8 L/min/m2.
Arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent LIMA to LAD.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH including DM type 2, [**Hospital3 9642**] mechanical AVR ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**], with recent broad spectrum antibiotic courses Pseudomonal UTI [**6-2**] and R foot infection [**7-2**] now presenting with suprapubic pain, low grade fever, leukocytosis and hypotension.
No evidence of PNA on CXR and cough at patient's baseline on admission.
With previous history of VRE and MRSA did initially receive daptomycin/vancomycin pending further culture data, as GNR more likely source, but d/c'ed on [**8-22**] and [**8-23**] respectively after blood cultures negative.
His WBC count was found to be elevated at 26 but pt was afebrile.
Initially there was concern that pt had SIRS or sepsis, however, WBC count resolved w/in 12 hours.
Pt was pan-cultured, no cultures positive to date since the urine culture gotten on admission.
CT abdomen, pelvis showed No RP bleed, no acute process.
His WBC count was found to be elevated at 26 but pt was afebrile.
Initially there was concern that pt had SIRS or sepsis, however, WBC count resolved w/in 12 hours.
Pt was pan-cultured, no cultures positive to date since the urine culture gotten on admission.
It was felt that the hypotension was likely vasovagal and c/b fluid resuscitation which then caused pulmonary edema.
Because of his difficult volume status he was transferred from the ICU to the cardiology service rather than to the regular floor team for further management.
He received RHC on [**9-4**] which revealed PCWP = 24, RVEDP = 14, PASP = 41, CI = 3.2.
Felt that patient could benefit from LHC to attempt to restore blood flow to regions noted on echo to be hypokinetic.
LHC/RHC/renal angiogram was performed on [**9-14**].
RHC showed improved PCWP but still elevated.
Renal angiogram showed no evidence of stenosis.
CT torso on [**8-22**] showed ground glass opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or ARDS.
# Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 25-30% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD explantation.
Repeat echo showed EF of 20%.
Restarted lisinopril on discharge but continued to hold metoprolol and spironolactone as it was felt patient could not tolerate at this time due to HR 60s and SBP 90s-100s on discharge.
cdiff toxin was sent and pt was started on PO flagyl.
C. diff EIA was negative and patient's diarrhea resolved, at which point PO flagyl was discontinued.
The following sliding scale was achieving good glucose control at the time of discharge: At all mealtimes, give 4 units of insulin if glucose 50-150, 12 units if 151-200, 16 units if 201-250, and so on with extra 4 units for every CBG range in increments of 50.
Medications on Admission: AMIODARONE - 200 mg daily ATORVASTATIN [LIPITOR] - 40 mg daily FUROSEMIDE - 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] GABAPENTIN - 400 mg TID INSULIN GLARGINE [LANTUS] - 120 units at bedtime INSULIN LISPRO [HUMALOG] - scale, before meals LEVETIRACETAM [KEPPRA] - 500 mg PO qHS "for seizures" LISINOPRIL - 2.5 mg daily METOLAZONE - 2.5 mg daily METOPROLOL TARTRATE - 12.5 mg daily NITROGLYCERIN - 0.4 mg SL prn chest pain, up to 3, etc.

Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Titrate to INR between 2.5 and 3.5, as directed by [**Hospital3 **].
Stop when INR is therapeutic (greater than 2.5) for 48 hours.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: urosepsis, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, right-sided foot ulcer status post multiple surgical debridements Secondary Diagnoses: 1. coronary artery disease status post bypass 2. history of ventricular fibrillation 3. history of pacemaker placement with subsequent infection and lead removal 4. aortic valve replacement 5. history of ascending aorta repair 6. hypertension 7. hyperlipidemia 8. diabetes mellitus, type 2, complicated by neuropathy 9. peripheral vascular disease, complicated by left sided below knee amputation 10. hepatitis C 11. hypothyroidism 12. history of opiate and benzodiazepine dependence 13. chronic subdural hematoma   Discharge Condition: Fair, with no shortness of breath or chest pain.
Lungs are clear to auscultation with trace dependent edema.
You received cardiac catherization which showed no new blockages that could be intervened on; therefore, the plan was to continue you on medical management.
The following medications were changed during your hospitalization: DISCONTINUED furosemide DISCONTINUED metolazone ADDED torsemide (instead of the two above medications) for removal of excess fluid DISCONTINUED metoprolol for now as your blood pressure and heart rate may not tolerate it DISCONTINUED spironolactone for now as your blood pressure may not tolerate it INCREASED gabapentin to 600 three times a day for better control of your neuropathic pain ADDED docusate for constipation ADDED senna for constipation ADDED bisacodyl for constipation ADDED miralax as needed for constipation ADDED lorazepam as needed for anxiety.
You were not restarted on this medication in the hospital because we were not sure your blood pressure could tolerate them at this time.
