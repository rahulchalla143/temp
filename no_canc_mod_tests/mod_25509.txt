Pt had an echo done that showed ant-lat hypokinesis w/ EF 30-35% c/w LAD disease, and repeat EKG showed that ST depressions had resolved.
Pt's troponin peaked at 0.11, and therefore pt was being considered for cath when he was transferred to the floor.
However, pt then became febrile while on the floor, and CXR showed likely PNA.
Past Medical History: HTN anxiety depression Has had neg stress in past- unclear how long ago, no cath   Social History: previous smoker- could not give details, no etoh, id use, retired works on farm and very mobile at baseline w/out limitation on activity   Family History: N/C  Physical Exam: Admission Physical Vitals: T: 98.4 degrees Farenheit, BP: 136/53 mmHg supine, HR 90bpm, RR 18 bpm, O2: 97 % on 40%fi02- nonrebreather.

We did a repeat echo which showed somewhat improved ventricular function.
# Thrombocytopenia: Plt count dropped from 180 ([**9-19**]) to 77 ([**9-21**]), improved back to 122.
Too soon to be Type II HIT and plt count too low to be Type I HIT.
Plt count continued to improve on levofloxacin and flagyl, so continued these medications and continued to monitor.
Felopdipine 2.5mg QD 2. clonazepam 1mg QD 3. sertraline 50mg QD 4.
ASA 81mg QD 5. simvastatin 20mg QD  Discharge Medications: 1. clonazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
