Review of systems at presentation was significant for no fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria or bright red blood per rectum.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient had a recent cardiac catheterization in [**2191-3-23**] which demonstrated diffuse three vessel disease.
Persantine thallium in [**2191-4-23**] demonstrated defects inferiorly (moderate partially reversible), apical (moderate to severe reversible) and anteroseptal (mild, fixed) walls.
The left ventricular ejection fraction was noted to be 31% at that time with global hypokinesis and enlargement.
Magnetic resonance imaging scan at that time was negative for osteomyelitis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission, the patient had a temperature of 97.9, blood pressure 132/66, heart rate 86, respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 98% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Left eye shut, extraocular movements full, oropharynx clear.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission sodium was 142, BUN 73, creatinine 2.3, white blood cell count 5.9, hematocrit 30, platelet count 233,000, prothrombin time 12, partial thromboplastin time 29.8, and INR 1.
On the day prior to discharge, BUN 29, creatinine 1.2, white blood cell count 4.7, hematocrit 33.1, and platelet count 328,000.
A chest x-ray was clear and venous ultrasound was negative for thrombosis at that time.
BUN and creatinine were noted to be elevated and he received one liter of half normal saline.
An electrocardiogram showed 1 mm inferior and lateral ST depressions and his chest pain resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.
He had received a total of three units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit less than 30.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on [**2191-11-10**] and consideration of repeat vascularization may be undertaken after the acute process resolves.
Secondary to increasing serum creatinine, Captopril was also discontinued on that day.
The patient had received Kayexalate per rectum for a potassium of 5.6.
The patient became febrile and had a temperature that peaked at 102.9.
The Nephrology Service was consulted for a rising creatinine (4.4) and oliguria.
He was noted to have cardiac enzymes that were positive and his metoprolol was decreased to 25 mg twice a day rather than discontinuing it altogether secondary to his hypotension.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for suctioning and blood pressure monitoring.
The patient's repeat chest x-ray on [**2191-11-13**] was stable.
His oxygenation continued to improve as well as the patient's blood pressure control.
His cardiac enzymes continued to trend down, his peak CK was 422 on [**2191-11-13**] and trended thereafter to 51 on [**2191-11-17**].
The patient's renal function continued to improve, with a creatinine of 1.2 on the day prior to discharge.
Eucerin cream applied to right lower extremity b.i.d.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] needs follow-up with cardiology, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22853**], at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2191-12-29**] at 11:00 a.m., telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2207**].
Left stump, wrap and dry Kerlix/gauze then wrap with an Ace wrap.
