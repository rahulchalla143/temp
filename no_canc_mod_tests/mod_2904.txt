The Emergency Room evaluation revealed a new anemia with a hematocrit of approximately 25.
His enzymes were negative and he was transfused three units of packed red blood cells to increase hematocrit to approximately 30.
Source of the blood loss was unclear but he did have dark stools.
On [**8-6**], he did finally have his cardiac catheterization which showed no flow limiting coronary artery disease but he did have an ascending aortic aneurysm of approximately six cm.
The left ventricular function was mildly depressed with an ejection fraction of approximately 45%.
When he was seen in [**Month (only) **], he did have an occasional wheeze but, on examination on the morning of admission, his lungs were clear.
At that time, transesophageal echocardiogram was ordered, as well as the possibility of an upper gastrointestinal series and colonoscopy to evaluate the source of his bleeding.
Arterial blood gases was also done and he recommended increased blood pressure control and to obtain a CT scan and a magnetic resonance scan of his neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis.
Of note, this was his second cardiac catheterization procedure in [**2195-7-27**].
The prior study was done in [**2193-7-27**].
He was examined by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 18078**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14968**] on the morning of surgery, same day admission, who found that his examination was somewhat unchanged.
His blood pressure was tightly controlled with plans to wake and wean him as able.
Blood pressure was 123/66.
Postoperatively, his white count was 10.4; hematocrit of 33.4; INR of 1.2; K of 4.4; BUN 26 and creatinine of 1.7.
His abdominal examination was benign.
His hematocrit was stable.
Platelet count dropped to 82,000.
On postoperative day number three, a decision was made to get a CT of his head which ruled out hemorrhage.
His examination was otherwise unremarkable.
She recommended Magnetic resonance scan of the brain to rule out an acute stroke or an intracranial MRA, to evaluate him for his continuing left upper extremity weakness.
His magnetic resonance scan was done at approximately 7 o'clock in the evening.
He maintained a good blood pressure with a mean of 80 to 90.
Hematocrit screen was sent off, as his platelets had dropped to 82,000 and then rose to 106,000.
The magnetic resonance scan from the day prior was consistent with bilateral strokes on the right side, moderate to large, and the left side a small stroke.
On postoperative day number four, his BUN was 28 and creatinine was 1.2 with a potassium of 4.2.
His chest x-ray showed consolidation of his left lower lobe.
His creatinine dropped to 1.0 on postoperative day number six.
His hematocrit remained stable at 30.9.
His BUN remained stable at 1.0.
Platelet count rose to 143,000.
His blood pressures continued to run high so he remained on his background nitroglycerin drip.
He had decreased breath sounds in his bases but his arterial blood gases were good at 50%.
The evaluation on [**10-29**] was whether or not he could be extubated in the morning, given his multitude of secretions; however, he was coughing them up when he would have a round of coughing, though he would become hypertensive.
He remained in sinus rhythm with a good blood pressure of 128/69.
His hematocrit was stable at 30 with a white count of 10.3; creatinine of 1.1.
His examination was unremarkable otherwise.
The plan was to have bronchoscopy done and then possibly extubated the patient.
He was sinus rhythm in the 90's with a blood pressure of 124/68.
He remained on C-Pap with pressure support, with a stable hematocrit and creatinine of 31 and 1.1 respectively.
He received some Diamox with a good blood pressure of 137/86.
His creatinine did remain stable at 1.2 and a stable hematocrit of 30.0.
He received Diamox three times a day as well as his aspirin with a stable creatinine and the plans to do a swallow evaluation.
His white count rose from 10 to 13 on the 7th and then to 16.5 on the morning of [**8-3**].
His video swallow study was done on the 8th, which he passed with flying colors.
He was in sinus rhythm in the 80's with a blood pressure of 134/73.
His white count dropped from 16.5 to 14.2.
His creatinine remained stable at 1.0.
His liver function tests were rechecked at that point, with an AST of 77, ALT of 64 and alkaline phosphatase of 336.
His total bilirubin was 0.8.
Amylase was 102.
Albumin was decreased at 2.6.
The swallow evaluation recommended that he could have full p.o.
On postoperative day number 12, [**11-4**], his blood pressure was 140/72.
His hematocrit rose to 35.0 with a creatinine of 1.1.
His last SMA-7 revealed a sodium of 143; potassium of 4.3; chloride of 115, bicarbonate 20; BUN 27; creatinine 1.1.
Calcium 8.0; magnesium of 2.2; phosphorus of 3.0.
His CBC on the day of discharge, showed a white count of 14.4; hematocrit of 35.0; platelet count of 426,000.
His T maximum was 98.4.
Acetylcysteine 20% 3 to 5 ml through nebulizer q. four to six hours prn.
