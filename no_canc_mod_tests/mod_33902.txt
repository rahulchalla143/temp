Following review of his CT scans he was taken to the Operating Room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for ORIF of his right hip, right ankle and left tibia.
His pain was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA and he was eventually placed on a CIWA protocol as he had some sinus tachycardia and agitation.
Although he is able to feed himself and perform some ADL's his level of functioning is below baseline and his thought processes are slow therefore further OT is recommended.
Mr. [**Known lastname 70545**]' initial Chest CT revealed a 1 cm spiculated mass in the LUL.
