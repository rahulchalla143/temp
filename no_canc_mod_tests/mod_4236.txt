Cardiac catheterization revealed moderate MR and two vessel CAD.
Initially presented to an OSH where BP was 109/68 with HR 129.
HCT found to ve 22.1.
In the ED, initial BP 116/79 with HR 120, RR 20 and 100% on room air.
BP fell to as low as 95/70 with HR in the 120s.
Coronary artery disease - Cardiac cath ([**11-15**]) with --LMCA: eccentric 40% ulcerated plaquing with slight contrast staining --LAD: 50% stenosis just after a large D1; 50% mid LAD stenosis after a smaller D2; 60% distal LAD stenosis; slightly slow flow in the LAD consistent with microvascular dysfunction --LCx: mild diffuse plaquing, and supplied a tortuous LPL; distal AV groove LCx was occluded after the LPL and filled slightly by antegrade vasa and right-to-left collaterals; proximal LPL 40% stenosis --RCA: mild diffuse plaquing throughout --RCA-RV fistula 3.
Physical Exam: VITALS: BP 111/79, HR 126, RR 14, 100% on RA GEN: Lying in bed.

Studies: [**2133-3-25**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Increased right-sided pleural effusion and possible infiltrate in the right lower lung.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**2133-3-25**] Endoscopy - Findings: Esophagus:  Lumen: Evidence of a previous esophago-gastric anastomosis was seen at 23 cm from the incisors.

# Upper GIB:  Pt had several episodes of hematemesis and was found to have HCT 22 at OSH.
Hct increased to 27.3 after 2 units packed RBC's; overall down from 31 two weeks prior.
The following day however, his oxygen saturations in low 90's at rest and decreased below 90% while laying flat therefore the procedure was again postponed for gentle diuresis to improve oxygenation.
# Acute blood loss anemia:  As above, [**2-9**] GI bleed which responded appropriately to blood tranfusion .
Aspirin was scheduled to be restarted after discharge and patient will discuss with his primary cardiologist risks vs benefits of restarting plavix  # Tachycardia: Patient had persistent tachycardia despite adequate fluid and blood replacement.
After remaining hemodynamically stable with no evidence of re-bleed, he was restarted on metoprolol with heart rate stable around 100.
Pleural fluid was sent for cytology and was negative for evidence of malignant cells.
Blood counts stable with no evidence of active bleeding.
You received several blood tranfusions and your blood counts remained stable.
Regarding your heart failure, please weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
