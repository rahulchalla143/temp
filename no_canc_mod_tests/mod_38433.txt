Pt recently saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on [**2119-8-16**] for evaluation for AVR.
Her most recent echocardiogram of [**2119-7-19**] showed severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.47cm2, mn 37) with normal systolic function (LVEF 60%).
There she was intubated for poor responsiveness and started on dopamine gtt for BP 70/40.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Vitals afebrile with HR 140, BP 97/64, RR 22 O2sat 95%.
BP decreased to 71/57, started on levophed and neosynephrine gtt and BP stabilized 90s/60s.
EKG showed Afibb with RVR.

Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2119-8-23**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
Imaging: CXR [**2119-8-21**]: New left internal jugular line terminates in the proximal SVC.
CXR [**2119-8-23**]: 1.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-8-22**], aortic valve gradient is lower.
Selective coronary angiography was performed using 4 Fr JL 4 and JR 4 diagnostic catheters.
Hemodynamic parameters were measured and an Amplatz 260 cm Extra stiff wire with floppy 7 cm tip shaped like a pigtail to avoid injuring the ventricle was delivered to the left ventricle through the pigtail catheter.
Non-obstructive CAD 2.
Brief Hospital Course: On admission pt required levophedrine and phenylephrine pressors to maintain blood pressure with MAP > 60.
On HD#2 TTE showed severe mitral regurgitation with flail valve, and severe aortic stenosis.
Unfortunately her blood pressure continued to decrease and she developed renal failure and anuria.
She also developed fever with leukocytosis (WBC 21), and CXR showed e/o RLL pneumonia.
Swann-Ganz catheter showed cardiac output of 3.1L/min and cardiac index of 1.9.
Unfortunately her blood pressure continued to decrease to 70s/40s despite pressors.
