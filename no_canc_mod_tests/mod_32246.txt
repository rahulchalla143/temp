His head CT showed ?EDH and skull fractures.
Pertinent Results: CT head from OSH: No hemorrhage appreciated.
Repeat CT at [**Hospital1 18**]: tiny SDH along tentorium, fractures are again noted.
MRV HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-5-1**] 12:27 AM FINDINGS: There is no acute infarct seen.
Hemorrhagic contusions are identified involving both cerebellar tonsils with increased signal seen within both cerebellar tonsils, which are displaced inferiorly to the upper cervical region.
MR BRACHIAL PLEXUS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-5-1**] 6:05 PM MR BRACHIAL PLEXUS: For the purposes of this study due to the fact that the patient was intubated and with an A-line in place, the right arm was imaged up and the left arm down.
IMPRESSION: 1) Normal MR appearance of the brachial plexi.
4) Left lung base consolidation, which in this setting is likely due to aspiration and/or contusion.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-5-2**] 9:42 AM FINDINGS: Similar appearance to subdural blood layering along the tentorium bilaterally.
Unchanged displacement of the cerebellar tonsils inferiorly, better assessed on the prior study of [**2195-5-1**].
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-5-8**] 8:08 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-5-11**] 3:41 PM IMPRESSION:  1.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    eval for infection / pt with left occipital open skull fracture s/p washout and    closure without [**Last Name (un) 2043**] repair...now with bump in WBC from 14 to 20 without    obvious source... CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:    None.
Final Report HISTORY: Rising white cell count with known left occipital open skull fracture status post washout and closure.
Comparison is made to [**5-2**] and [**5-8**] CT examinations as well as [**5-1**] MRI examination.
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Unenhanced images of the brain display hypodensity at the patient's known sites of prior hemorrhagic contusions within the left cerebellar tonsil and left cerebellar hemisphere.
Its size as well as the degree of internal fluid content appears predominantly new from the [**5-2**] exam and increased from the [**5-8**] exam.

The regions of intraparenchymal rim enhancement surrounding the prior sites of hemorrhagic contusions are less conspicuous on today's exam which suggests no underlying parenchymal infection.
TECHNIQUE: Axial contiguous images were obtained through the brain without and with intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Unenhanced images of the brain demonstrate no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular territorial infarct.
The regions of intraparenchymal contusion again display very mild rim enhancement; however, this is less conspicuous than the most recent enhanced examination of [**5-11**] suggesting evolving intraparenchymal hematomas.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After the risks and benefits of the procedure as well as local anesthesia were explained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.
A scout image was taken which demonstrated the PICC line tip was located in the right IJ.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
On exam he was found to have left upper extremity weakness.
He underwent CT c-spine that showed no fracture and cervical MRI which showed no ligamentous injury.
He also had brachial plexus MRI which showed no injury.
He also had MRV which showed the left transverse sinus demonstrating narrowing in its midportion at the site of fracture and therefore was started on aspirin.
EEG testing was completed which showed Left slowing, no seizure foci.
Speech and swallowing evaluation was done and he was started on a regular; dysphagia diet with no difficulty.
CT of the head was negative for new findings.
It was noted that his WBC count jumped from 14 - 20 in 24 hours.
A contrasted head CT was ordered as well as a UA.
His urine and sputum cultures were negative.
A contrasted head CT was obtained [**12-29**] to increased WBC.
His CT revealed thick rim enhancing subcutaneous fluid collection abuting fracture site with enhancement surrounding the site was concering for infection, wound was aspirated and sent for cultures.
The following day, patient had a nonfocal exam and recieved a lumbar puncture to rule out central nervous system infection.
He was brought to the OR on [**2195-5-13**] after bedside eval of wound revealed active exudative drainage.
Contrast CT of the brain was obtained for re-eval of possible intracranial abcess vs infarct (enhancement eval).
CSW eval obtained for clarity of use of IV drug use history.
