[**2124-3-15**] CT chest/abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
No definite evidence malignancy identified on this study, however, this study was only performed with a single phase of contrast, limiting assessment for more subtle lesions, especially within the liver.
A chest CT was notable for diffuse bronchiolitis.
Patient had multiple AFBs sent that remained negative (cultures can be followed up later but no growth now) and negative PPD so taken off TB precautions.
Should be seen by ID consult at [**Hospital1 1501**] and can contact ID group here at [**Hospital1 18**] for further discussion.
Recommend repeat CT scan chest in 3 weeks to watch progression of disease.
Should get repeat checks and continue to encourage oral fluid intake aggressively, especially with diarrhea.
With question of liver disease might still consider outpatient EGD, especially if repeat bleeding.
# Adrenal gland: Possibly enlarged on CT scan.
# Chronic pancreatitis: Found to have calcifications of pancreas on CT scan without elevation amylase/lipase.
