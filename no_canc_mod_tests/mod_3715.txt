By EMT report, the patient was found alert, confused, and noted to not be transferred to [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital, where evaluation revealed hyponatremia to 127, leukocytosis at 19,000, CK of 14,000 with MB of 85, troponin of 8.81, and right and chronic subdural hematoma.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation.
The patient's vital signs in the emergency room were as follows:  Blood pressure 158/81, heart rate 105, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
Head CT here revealed a small bilateral subdural fluid collection consistent with acute and chronic subdural hematomas.
Chest x-ray was negative for infiltrate.
EKG revealed ST segment depressions of approximately 1 mm in leads 2 and 3.
The patient had a troponin elevation of 4.3 on [**5-1**], and the patient was started on a beta blocker.
The CKs demonstrated a downward trend with urine alkalinization to 3500 on transfer.
The patient's hyponatremia remained stable at 128.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: Temperature 97.4; heart rate 116; respiratory rate 19; blood pressure 120/51; oxygen saturation 94% on room air.
HEENT:   Examination revealed the forehead to have a macular erythema with diffuse scaling.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with minimal air movement due to poor inspiratory effort.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following: The patient had a white blood cell of 10.2, hematocrit 31.3, platelet count 208,000.
Sodium 128, potassium 3.4, chloride of 93, CO2 of 29, BUN 9, creatinine of 0.7, glucose of 109.
AST 186, ALT 91, alkaline phosphatase of 41, total bilirubin of 1.4, CK of 3,529, magnesium of 1.9, phosphate of 1.9 and free calcium of 1.10.
He had a urinalysis on [**5-1**], which revealed large amount of fluid, trace protein, small leukocyte Estrace, 15 white blood cells, 28 red blood cells, few bacteria, less than 1 epithelial cell.
Chest x-ray revealed clear lungs.
CT of the head revealed multiple small bilateral acute and chronic subdural hematomas with no shift or mass effect.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tongue cancer, who was found down and subsequently found to have rhabdomyolysis, hyponatremia, troponin leak with EKG changes, in addition to acute and chronic subdural hematomas.
Incidentally, the MRI revealed a lesion over C2 that the radiologist felt was concerning for a potential bony metastases.
The patient subsequently had a bone scan, which was negative for metastatic disease to the bone.
Per the Neurosurgical Service, he will have a repeat CAT scan of his head in approximately three weeks.
RHABDOMYOLYSIS:  During his hospital stay, the patient's CK levels trended markedly downward.
He maintained good urine output with normal renal function.
The patient had a urine osmolality of 589 with a urine sodium of 101, as well as a serum osmolality of 258 with sodium of 128.
He was on a fluid restriction of 1.5 liters, and the downward trend occurred in spite of this.
The patient had a favorable response to this and the sodium increased to his initial level of 128.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had an echocardiogram on admission, which revealed 2+ mitral regurgitation and a normal ejection fraction.
He did not have any clear evidence on the echocardiogram to explain the patient's falls.
