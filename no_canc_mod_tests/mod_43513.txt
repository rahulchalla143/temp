The patient was followed on an outpatient basis and noted to have an elevated creatinine on [**2198-2-1**] - the creatinine was 3.3 and the Prograf level was 22.
On [**2-5**], the patient's creatinine was noted to be 5.1, with a Prograf level of 16.4.
The patient was admitted to the transplant unit for further evaluation of elevated creatinine.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, secondary to ANCA glomerulonephritis, scleroderma, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction x two, status post LAD stent, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30 percent, peripheral vascular disease, right upper lung mass, chronic, history of MAC.
The patient was admitted, received initial intravenous fluid hydration, and ultrasound was obtained on [**2-5**].
Ultrasound of the right kidney transplant revealed mild hydronephrosis, which was new compared to [**2198-1-23**].
The patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and it was decided that a kidney biopsy would be obtained.
This was re-started on hospital day two for a level of 18.1.
Her white count did trend down to 3.5.
Vital signs were as follows: Temperature 96.2, heart rate 84, blood pressure 176/84, respiratory rate 28, oxygen saturation on three liters 92 percent.
Cardiovascularly, the heart rate was regular, with a normal S1 and S2 without any murmurs.
A chest x-ray was ordered stat, and an EKG was done as well.
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for respiratory distress.
Her chest x-ray result revealed pulmonary edema  Her EKG was normal.
Initial ABG's were 7.09, 100, 58, 19 and negative 12.
She was bagged and her oxygen saturation was 72 and came up to 100 percent with the bag breathing.
Hematocrit was stable.
Vital signs were stable, and labs were as follows:  Sodium 141, potassium 3.9, chloride 106, CO2 20, BUN 47, creatinine 3.
The patient did receive cardiac enzymes that were as follows: Troponin 0.31, CK-MB 17, MBI 10.8.
Cardiology recommended that the patient receive a transesophageal echocardiogram to evaluate heart function.
She was placed on a nitroglycerin drip as well, given the elevated enzymes, and serial enzymes were drawn.
She was further diuresed, and gradually her urine output picked up.
She was given a further transfusion of packed red blood cells for a crit of 27.
Urine output continued to improve.
Urine output improved to a liter and a half per day.
Creatinine trended down to 1.5 on day of discharge on [**2-14**].
LABS ON DISCHARGE ([**2-14**]):  Creatinine 1.5, BUN 32, sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 103, CO2 28, glucose 175.
Of note, her glucose ranged from a low of 117 to a high of 215.
Also of note, white blood cell count was improved upon discharge, with a white blood cell count of 3.9.
Her hematocrit was 31.6 on day of discharge.
Vital signs were stable.
Her echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of 25-30 percent.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
The patient was discharged on [**2-14**] with creatinine of 1.5.
