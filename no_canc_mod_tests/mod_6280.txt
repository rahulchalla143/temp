Her NIH stroke scale was 21.
She had a head CT, which did not show any bleeding and a decision was made to give the patient TPA.
The patient had a CTA, which showed a clot in the M1 distribution and it was decided that she may be a candidate for thrombectomy.
She was brought to the interventional radiology suite; however, when she got there, it was noted on the CTA and CT perfusion maps that there was no obvious penumbra and the stroke attending felt that it would not give much benefit The decision was made that the risks of opening up the clot were greater than the benefits and the patient was admitted to the ICU service for further management.

Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo female with hx HTN, HLD, atrial tachycardia, baseline dementia, hx ACA stroke (without residual deficits) who was initially admitted to the neurology service on [**12-22**] for large R MCA stroke, went into AF-RVR, was transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further management, and underwent successful TEE-Cardioversion.
Her exam was notable for a flaccid left arm with extensor posturing to stim, a left leg that triple flexes, left facial droop, right gaze deviation, left hemi-neglect.
The patient had a stat CT which did not show any hemorrhage.
Patient was admitted to neuro-ICU with q1 hour neuro checks under [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 9235**] [**Doctor Last Name **].
Follow up head CT demonstrated extension but no definite evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.
BP was kept at goal of SBP 160 - 180.
# AF-RVR: Patient went into Atrial-Tach with aberrency [**12-23**] while undergoing PEG placement and received Amio 300mg IV due to concern for V-Tach, then converted to SR; also received esmolol for hypertensive urgency and diltiazem gtt in the PACU, which made the patient hypotensive.
Pt was started on several regimens of diltiazem, metoprolol and digoxin which were unsuccessful due to hypotension (goal SBP 110-180 per neuro) and persistent tachycardia.
**QTc will need to be followed with serial EKGs after discharge, with goal QTc < 500 on disopyramide.
Pt then underwent a speech and swallow evaluation and diet was advanced to thickened liquids and ground solids, which she was tolerating on discharge.
# Anemia: Work-up revealing for ACD with Fe:TIBC of 24, but with likely concamitant iron deficiency anemia with low-normal Ferritin and Fe.
