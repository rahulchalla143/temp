No clonus Sensation reduced below C7 to light touch At discharge she had an episode of hypotension which resolved when in bed to 140/55.
Multilevel degenerative changes within the lumbar spine, most prominent at C4-C5 with disc bulge and facet degenerative changes causing minimal narrowing of the spinal cord and indentation of the thecal sac.
ECHO [**2113-4-29**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Head CT [**2113-4-29**]: No evidence of SAH.
EEG [**2113-4-30**]: Normal  Carotid Ultrasound [**2113-5-2**]: Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 76/21, 56/10, 79/17 cm/sec.
CCA peak systolic velocity is 52 cm/sec.
ECA peak systolic velocity is 100 cm/sec.
On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 75/20, 85/18, 72/16 cm/sec.
CCA peak systolic velocity is 54 cm/sec.
ECA peak systolic velocity is 67 cm/sec.
She was admitted to the ICU for close observation where her blood pressure was kept to a MAP of 85 for perfusion.
Repeat head CT was stable and she was transferred to the floor.
Syncope workup:  ECHO was negative  Carotid ultrasound (see report)  EEG was normal  Hgb A1c 5.9  PT/OT worked with the patient and recommended rehab placement.
You will not need spinal imaging at that time, but you will need a Head CT to reassess your head bleed.
