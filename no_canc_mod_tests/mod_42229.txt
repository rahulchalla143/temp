Trimethoprim/sulfa sensitivity confirmed by [**Doctor Last Name 3077**]-[**Doctor Last Name 3060**].
(scan at OSH at noon shows 1x1x1 cm bleed)  MR brain [**2-27**]: Area of hemorrhage in the left corona radiata unchanged in size since the prior CT obtained on the same day.
Echo [**2-28**]: 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mild depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Head CT was done and showed small left parasagittal hemorrhage.
MR of the brain was done but did not visualize the area of the hemorrhage because the bleeding was located above where the cuts were taken.
The patient's blood pressure control was optimized with goal to keep SBP between 120-140.
The patient underwent CT Angio on [**3-4**] which was negative for aneurysm.
He was initially started empirically on Levofloxacin which on [**3-2**] was changed to Zosyn after his urine culture grew resistant E coli and sensitive Klebsiella.
On [**3-3**] CXR showed new LLL infiltrated and Clindamycin was added to cover aspiration pneumonia.
Baseline Cr 1.4-1.8.
Patient received Mucomyst and hydration with bicarb IV fluids for renal protection pre- and post- contract administration for CT Angio on [**3-4**].
His renal function, urine output will need to be monitored closely given risk of nephrotoxicity.
On the day of discharge, his creatinine was stable at 1.4.
Patient received one unit pRBC for HCT 28 given h/o CAD on [**2-28**].
His HCT has been stable close to 30.
Fe studies (pre-transfusion) were checked and showed normal serum iron, high ferritin and normal TIBC.
The patient's goal SBP 120-140 in the acute period after the hemorrhage and then can be lowered to goal SBP <130.
His SBP was in 130-150 range on these medications.
He underwent video swallowing study on [**3-5**] and did well.
Intracranial bleed, parasagital 2.
Parkinsonism 3.
