Her hematocrit was noted to be 36.5 with a white blood cell count of 11.6 and her INR was 31.
She received four units of fresh frozen plasma and a head CT scan was performed, which was read as negative for an acute intracranial hemorrhage.
An abdominal CT scan was performed which revealed diverticula and a thickened proximal sigmoid and descending colon within significant stranding and calcified vascular structures.
Her rectal examination revealed maroon guaiac positive stool.
She was admitted to the medicine service for further evaluation and management of her lower gastrointestinal bleed.
History of diverticula in the sigmoid colon on a colonoscopy in [**2144-7-2**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 98, heart rate 87 to 120, blood pressure 113/42, orthostatics negative, respiratory rate 22 and oxygen saturation 99% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear, dry mucous membranes, anicteric sclerae.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 11.6 with 82% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes and 5.5% monocytes, hematocrit 36.5, platelet count 155,000, prothrombin time 69.1, partial thromboplastin time 87.1, INR 31.6, sodium 126, potassium 4.6, chloride 91, bicarbonate 27, BUN 11 and creatinine 0.6.
Admission head CT negative was negative for intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage.
Admission CT of abdomen and pelvis revealed significant bowel wall thickening, stranding and pericolic fluid at the level of the left distal descending and proximal sigmoid colon, diverticula and vascular calcifications present; differential diagnosis diverticulitis versus ischemic bowel and/or hemorrhage into the bowel wall; there were also large gallstones present without evidence of cholecystitis.
Her hematocrit remained stable and she required no additional blood transfusions.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] aortic valve replacement, for which she was on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
On admission, her INR was 31.6.
She received fresh frozen plasma, blood transfusions and vitamin K, as above.
Their recommendation was to continue intravenous heparin with a goal partial thromboplastin time of 50 to 60.
Heparin was therefore restarted and her partial thromboplastin time was monitored closely.
After her INR fell to 2, her Coumadin was restarted without a loading dose at 2.5 mg orally at bedtime.
She will be continued on heparin until her INR is therapeutic, which is 2.5 to 3.5.
She received additional Lasix while in the Intensive Care Unit for some mild pulmonary edema after receiving multiple units of fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells.
