Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year-old female with a history of morbid obesity s/p gastric bypass, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma who presents with acute on chronic abdominal pain, for which she was discharged on [**2124-2-18**] after a negative evaluation which included abdominal/pelvic CT.  She reported improvement in her abdominal pain, which she describes as sharp, epigastric pain radiating to the RUQ and LUQ, after initiation of laxatives and antitussive agents.
On arrival to the ED, she was found to have an O2 sat of 55% on room air but her VS were otherwise stable (Temp 98, BP 140/85, RR 20-24).
She was mentating appropriately, A&O x 3, and though her primary complaint was abdominal pain and she described no subjective SOB, fevers, chills, cough, or chest pain, her evaluation focused on her hypoxia.
On exam, she was found to be wheezy with decreased BS bilaterally, and was thought to have an asthma exacerbation, for which she was given nebs, steroids, and azithro 500mg x 1 after blood cx were sent.
An EKG was performed and demonstrated pseudonormalization of t waves in V2-V6.
She was later placed on a 50% ventimask and had an O2 sat of 96% at that time.
A CXR was also performed and was negative for any acute process and no evidence of hyperinflation.
Of note, during her prior hospitalization, she was found to have a room air sat in the 70s% and 75% on 2L.

EKG [**2124-2-21**]: Unchanged from prior.
CXR [**2124-2-21**]: Stable cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
VBG showed baseline chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.
The CXR was unchanged with no focal abnormalities or new effusions.
An echocardiogram showed advanced cor pulmonale.
During her last hospitalization, abdominal wall pain was diagnosed.
MRI of the abdomen was considered for further evaluation.
However, upon discussion with the radiology team, they felt that an MRI would not reveal any pathology that could not be seen on The CT scan that was already done.
Surgery felt that there was no evidence of hernia on prior CT (recent).
