She underwent induction of labor at 37-2/7th week gestational age on [**2132-12-21**] for intrauterine growth restriction.
At approximately 1 a.m. on [**2132-12-23**], approximately 32 hours after induction began, the patient delivered over an intact perineum a 4-pound 13-ounce infant, Apgars 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.
Estimated blood loss was 1 to 2 L.  She received Cytotec 1000 mcg per rectum, Humibid 0.25 mg x2 subcutaneus, and IV Pitocin.
Her estimated blood loss was 2 L.  Urine output was 400 cc.
Post-transfusion hematocrit was 27.8.
Blood pressure was 69/31.
At that time, a laparotomy was performed under general anesthesia.
Total products were 11 units of packed red blood cells, 7 units of FFP, 10 units of platelets, and 7 L of normal saline and lactated Ringer.
Ultrasound at the bedside prior to the reinversion showed homogenous endometrial lining.
Of note, on postpartum day number 0, her blood pressure was noted to be 154/92.
Her blood pressure remained elevated.
LABORATORY DATA AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  Sodium 139, potassium 3.9, magnesium 1.1, calcium 6.8, hematocrit 22.1 percent, platelets 63, INR 1.2, and PTT 30.7.
Urine protein negative.
ALT 66.
Given the elevated blood pressure, hypokalemia, anemia, and low platelets, the decision was made to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She had a total products of 13 units packed red blood cells, 7 units of FFP, and 10 units of platelets.
Ultrasound on [**2132-12-19**], ESW less than 10th percentile.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.3, blood pressure 133/70, heart rate 74, and oxygen saturation 100 percent on 2 L.  In general, the patient was pale, in no acute distress.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities:  Trace edema, 2 plus DTRs bilaterally and no clonus bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  At 1:45 p.m., white blood cell count 13.7, hematocrit 27.2, and platelets 76.
PT 12.4, PTT 25.2, INR 1.0, and fibrinogen 338.
Uric acid 4.6, sodium 139, and potassium 3.9.
A CT was ordered.
Urine output was monitored very closely, and she continued to have epidural for pain.
Social work consult was requested, and the plan was to transfuse to keep hematocrit above 30.
Chest x-ray obtained was negative.
CT scan showed no evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding; this was on hospital day number 1.
On hospital day number 2, the patient's platelets were 66 and hematocrit 27.4 percent.
Coagulation studies were normal, fibrinogen 338, and her Foley was continued.
Her electrolytes were repleted as necessary.
Hematocrit was stable at 27 percent.
Her temperature was 97.5.
The rest of her vital signs were stable.
Her temperature was 99.3.
Urinalysis, culture and sensitivity were obtained.
Urinalysis showed possible sign of infection with less than 1 squamous epithelial cell, 204 white blood cells, and 293 red blood cells.
