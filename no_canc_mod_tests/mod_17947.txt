He was noted to be in CHF (edema on CXR and BNP of 993), so he was given furosemide 40mg IV, producing 300ml of urine.
To achieve better rate control, an amiodarone drip was initiated, and following this his bp dropped to the 70's, so he was started on a phenylephrine drip and placed on a NRB-mask.
At the time of transfer, his vitals were t 101.3, bp 105/p, hr 60's (on 36mcg of norepi gtt), rr 18, and spo2 mid-high 90's on A/C 700/18/80/5.
His transfer labs were signficant for a WBC of 17.6 (up from 10), Hct of 41, plt of 419, bicarb of 18, BUN of 20, Cr of 1.1, and ABG of 7.45/24/315/16.

- Discontinued Ceftaz in CCU - continued vanco for a total 7-day course - continued broad abx with aztreonam for in place of ceftaz for a total 7-day course - f/u cultures here negative - Was afebrile X 4 days with normal wbc count on discharge .
EF 15-20% at GoodSam.
CXR and vent/abg were consistent with pulm edema, likely secondary to CHF-EF 15-18%.
Will need repeat outpt echo (in 3 months) for evaluation of cardiomyopathy and possible primary prevention with ICD.
- continue lasix with potassium supplementation - Cath with moderate 3VD, plan for stress in future - will recommend he get HIV testing as outpatient .

With transaminases this elevated and only modestly elevated alk phos and t bili, the most plausible diagnosis is shock liver.
