[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3845**] who told her that her EKG looked significantly different compared to the one from several years back.
She has since seen Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 33428**] [**Name (STitle) **] in consultation and underwent stress testing that was positive for ischemia.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization on [**2120-11-21**] revealed three vessel coronary artery disease and a reduced ejection fraction without evidence of mitral regurgitation calculated at 34%.
Coronary angiography showed a codominant system; the LAD showed a 80% stenosis of the midsegment followed by sequential 80% stenosis in the distal segment, accompanied by a 80% proximal D1 stenosis; the LCX was a large, codominant vessel with an 80% midsegment stenosis and 80% OM2 and 80% OM3 stenoses; the RCA showed an 80% midsegment stenosis with a 100% distal occlusion and left to right collaterals filling the codominant RPDA.

Initial abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable while a head CT scan found no evidence for hemorrhage, or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Her creatinine also rose.
On [**2120-12-5**], an exploratory laparotomy, liver biopsy and cholecystectomy was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Liver pathology was consistent with ischemia while gall bladder findings revealed mild chronic cholecystitis.
She returned to the CSRU for further invasive monitoring and medical management.
Her creatinine peaked to 5.1.
A renal ultrasound was unremarkable.
Her urine output and hyperkalemia gradually improved with intravenous Lasix and Diurel.
During her hospitalization, her AST and ALT peaked at 6339 and [**Numeric Identifier 101221**]; LDH and Alk Phos peaked at [**Numeric Identifier 101222**] and 276; and Total bili peaked at 2.9.
A repeat abdominal ultrasound on [**12-6**] remained unremarkable.
She maintained mostly a normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the 60-70's but continued to experience paroxsymal atrial fibrillation.
Procain and NAPA levels were monitored closely and titrated accordingly while serial ECGs were obtained to assess QTc interval.
Medical therapy was optimized and Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR around 1.5 - 2.0.
At discharge, her BP was 140-150/70-80 with a HR of  60-70 in sinus rhythm with oxygen saturations of 97% on room.
Dose should be adjusted for goal INR between 1.5 - 2.0.

Patient needs to elevate legs and wear compression stockings.
Warfarin should be dosed for goal INR around 1.5 - 2.0.
