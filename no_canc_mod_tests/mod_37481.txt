In the ED, her vitals were T 104.1, HR 72, BP 144/103, RR 20, and 100% on RA.
Her labs showed leukocytosis with left shift, UA was positive although urine culture later came back negative.

Micro: Urine culture - NGTD Blood x 2from admission [**8-10**] - MRSA, surveillance cultures [**Date range (1) 102796**] with NGTD HD catheter tip: No growth .
CXR [**2114-8-10**].
CT abdomen/pelvis 1.
Upper Extremity Doppler (Left) 1.
CT HEAD [**8-11**]: Slight prominence of subdural spaces at the convexity is more prominent than the previous studies.
This could be related to differences in angulation of the scans, but a followup study would help to confirm the stability.
CT HEAD [**8-12**]: Unchanged from yesterday .
CT scan of abdomen showed ?cholecystitis.
In the MICU, patient was started on meningitis doses of vanco and ceftriaxone given her significantly altered mental status, and flagyl for the abdominal CT findings.
Then blood cultures grew 4/4 bottles of GPCs which were eventually found to be MRSA, and a CXR later showed findings of pneumonia.
At that time her fever source was identified, and her antimicrobials were pared down to vancomycin and zosyn.
An echocardiogram confirmed the absence of vegetations, and the source of the MRSA bacteremia was felt to be related to her HD line.
She is recieving the vancomycin via HD protocol and will need vancomycin troughs on the days of [**Year (4 digits) 2286**].
In addition to this she will need safety lab monitoring during her vancomycin course, which per IDSA guidlines is a weekly CBC with differential.
Line tip cultures were negative, and surveillance cultures from [**Date range (1) 102796**] have [**Last Name (un) 22315**] no growth to date.
A TEE was not attempted as the patient will already complete a course adequate to cover for endocarditis.
Subdural hematoma was found to be stable on CT head, so it was deemed to be an unlikely etiology.
An EEG was consistent with severe encephalopathy.
Dilantin toxicity: Patient's initial serum dilantin level was ~15 which is ostensibly within normal limits.
HD line associated Left upper extremity DVT - Per sister's observations while patient was in the MICU.
Upper extremity Doppler ultrasound ordered and found to be negative for thrombotic process.
Ultrasound showed a DVT in the left internal jugular so patient was started on heparin.
She was dosed with 3mg of coumadin, and her most recent INR is subtherapeutic at 1.1  She will likely require a limited duration of anticoagulation as this is HD line associated.
Hyperthyroidism - TSH was within normal limits (1.6) when checked in MICU.
MRSA bacteremia- presumed source is the HD line 2.
Toxic metabolic encephalopathy   Discharge Condition: -Afebrile -Hemodynamically stable, blood pressures are frequently elevated in the 180 systolic range around [**Hospital6 2286**] days -Able to respond to verbal stimuli- opens eyes on command, shakes head yes/no, mouths words.
