At [**Hospital1 **] he got a head CT w/wo contrast that showed a possible rind enhancing lesion although as they didn't have his prior imaging they could not tell if this was surgical change vs residual/recurrent abscess, and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
He was taken to [**University/College **] for evaluation when fluid filled cysts were noted on his imaging.
The cultures returned C.albicans, and he was placed on a month of amphotericin and 5-flucytosine.

While this could be secondary to infectious material within the aqueduct, it is possible there are underlying adhesions/webs with chronic hydrocephalus, which would account for the lack of transpendymal migration of CSF; correlation with prior imaging is needed.
Marked abnormality and enhancement of the right globe, as well as enlargement and heterogeneous enhancement of the lacrimal gland.
Dedicated cervical spine imaging would help further evaluate this finding.
MRI Flow Study [**8-13**]: FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of the right frontal catheter and interval placement of a left frontal catheter which terminates at the level of the foramen magnum.
CSF dynamic flow study does not demonstrate any flow through the cerebral aqueduct.
Minimal interval decrease in size of ventriculomegaly  Head CT [**8-15**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-8-16**] Again seen is bilateral frontal burr hole post- surgical change, with left lateral ventriculostomy with the catheter tip in unchanged position in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Debris within the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle is better characterized on previous MR studies, and there is continued hypodensity posterior to the lateral ventricle which is not changed.
Osseous structures and soft tissues appear otherwise unremarkable, with right globe changes including scleral band and increased density of the vitreous unchanged and better evaluated on previous MRI exam.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2148-8-17**] (ltd study) T2W sequences appear to demonst artifact relat to turbulent flow at expected site of the III ventriculostomy, in interpeduncular cistern, just ant to the mamillary bodies.
final rdg pending interpretation of the sag (cine) phase-contrast sequences.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2148-8-19**] FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of a left frontal-approach ventriculostomy catheter.
There is effacement of the cerebral sulci and basal cisterns, which is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is admitted to the neurosurgical service for further evaluation of hydrocephalus in the setting of mental status change.
On [**8-12**] he was taken to the OR emergently for an external ventricular drain placement.
MRI flow study done on [**8-14**] revealed that the prior 3rd ventriculostomy was not patent and would require re-do surgery.
CSF cultures were finalized as negative for bacteria/fungus.. On [**2148-8-19**] the distal EVD catheter was removed as he exhibited no sign of hydrocephalus.
MRI cine flow studies were reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and he was satisfied with the CSF flow.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
*You will need a repeat fundoscopic exam in 2 weeks at home or Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17233**] at [**Last Name (un) **] Bld.
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 25524**]  Please call the Infectious disease clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] to schedule and appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 82115**] to be seen in [**2-14**] weeks.
