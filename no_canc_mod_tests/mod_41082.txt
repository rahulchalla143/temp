Admission Date:  [**2106-5-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2106-6-1**]   Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman who is a resident of the [**Hospital3 1186**] who has a history of Alzheimer's dementia, tardive dyskinesia, at baseline nonverbal, and was noted at the nursing home to be having increasing wheezing with 02 saturations in the 80s to low 90s.
Respiratory rate was noted to be in the 20-26 range, blood pressure 112/60, heart rate 120s.
While she was in the Emergency Room, the blood pressure was in the 90s, temperature of 102 and the patient was started on ceftriaxone and Flagyl for a urinary tract infection as she was noted to have pus in her Foley.
She received fluids and had improvement in her blood pressure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99 going up to 102.8 in the Emergency Room, blood pressure 94/66, pulse 122-125, respiratory rate 30, saturations 82% on room air, 100% later on 3 liters.
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA: White count 12.4, 83% neutrophils, 9% lymphs, hematocrit 31.5, platelets 449,000.
Chem-7 137, potassium 5.7, chloride 99, bicarbonate 27, BUN 44, creatinine 0.7, glucose 117, calcium 9.1, magnesium 2.2, phosphorus 0.8.
INR 1.0.
The U/A on admission revealed a specific gravity of 1.014, hazy, small leukocyte esterase, small blood, positive nitrates, trace protein, negative glucose, negative ketones, greater than 50 white blood cells and a few bacteria.
EKG was sinus tachycardia at 119.
Lactate of 3.0.
SEPSIS:  The patient was stable and initially admitted under sepsis protocol to the VICU where she received aggressive hydration, transfused 2 units of blood for a hematocrit less than 30.
The patient's CVPs were monitored and were otherwise stable.
The patient initially had some respiratory distress after her fluid hydration but this improved and was stable with minimal 02 by nasal cannula.
The patient was noted to have gram-negative rods growing from her urine culture and eventually this grew out Citrobacter .................... which was sensitive to levofloxacin and ceftazidime and was the likely source of her sepsis.
There was also initial concern for pneumonia; however, the patient continued to improve, had follow-up chest x-rays.
The chest x-ray on [**2106-5-28**] showed just mild CHF and no evidence of pneumothorax.
The patient had a follow-up chest x-ray on [**2106-5-31**] which was also consistent with CHF versus pneumonia.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable.
The patient was weaned off pressors pretty quickly and did not require further fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure.
This improved with 3 liters of 02 and then after aggressive hydration for her blood pressure was in mild respiratory distress, transferred to the VICU but remained respiratory stable on 2 liters and a cool nebulizer face mask.
She had a blood gas of 7.40/37/185 and was oxygenating well.
