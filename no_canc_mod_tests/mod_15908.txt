Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and the patient received several rounds of epinephrine and atropine; with, by report, return of pulse and blood pressure.
An electrocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated sinus tachycardia to the 120s, new right bundle-branch block, and 1-mm to 2-mm ST depressions in the precordial and inferior leads.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for possible cardiac catheterization and further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on arrival to [**Hospital1 69**] revealed temperature was 98.8, heart rate was 110, blood pressure was 80/50 (on dopamine), oxygen saturation was 93% on assist-control with FIO2 of 100% and 15 of positive end-expiratory pressure.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pulmonary examination revealed bilateral rales anteriorly with bronchial breath sounds at the left base.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardic with normal first heart sound and second heart sound.
Abdominal examination revealed soft, mildly distended, hypoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities were warm with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed sedated with occasional agitation and withdrawal to pain.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Significant laboratories and studies at the outside hospital revealed arterial blood gas with a pH of 6.8, PCO2 of 71.6, PO2 of 66.8, with a bicarbonate of 11.3.
Creatine kinase was 191, and troponin I was 4.93.
Complete blood count was notable for a white blood cell count of 14.3.
Chemistry-7 was notable for a blood urea nitrogen of 18 and a creatinine of 1.5.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray at the outside hospital demonstrated bilateral alveolar infiltrates.
Laboratories and studies on admission to [**Hospital1 346**] revealed complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 18.5, hematocrit was 40.5, and platelets were 242.
White blood cell count differential revealed 77% neutrophils, 13% bands, 2% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, and 4% atypical cells.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 134, potassium was 5.9 (hemolyzed), chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 17, blood urea nitrogen was 28, creatinine was 2, and blood glucose was 351.
Calcium was 7.4, phosphate was 4.9, magnesium was 1.7.
Liver function tests revealed ALT was 62, AST was 222, alkaline phosphatase was 949, total bilirubin was 0.9, LDH was 951.
The second set of enzymes revealed creatine kinase was 1229, CK/MB was 74, with an index of 6.
Coagulation studies revealed PT was 16.7, PTT was 94.5, and INR was 1.9.
Arterial blood gas revealed pH was 7.31, PCO2 was 36, PO2 was 77, with an oxygen saturation of 95% on assist-control, tidal volume was 600, respiratory rate was 20, FIO2 was 100%, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 15.
The patient developed a ST-elevation myocardial infarction with peak creatine kinase of greater than [**2134**], and an ejection fraction of 10% to 15%, secondary to global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for persistent fevers to 104; however, multiple sets of cultures including sputum, blood, and urine were without growth.
The source of the infection was initially felt likely to be a pulmonary process; however, given the persistent fevers despite broad spectrum antibiotics, the patient underwent head, thoracic, and abdominal CAT scans for evaluation for potential additional source of infection.
The head CAT scan was notable for diffuse (predominantly posterior) edema with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter distribution.
The sinus CAT scan demonstrated multiple air/fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses.
The chest CAT scan demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions with pulmonary edema, and no lymphadenopathy.
The abdominal CAT scan was unremarkable.
Neurology was consulted for evaluation of neurologic status.
