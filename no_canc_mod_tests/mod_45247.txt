She required four to five liters oxygen to maintain saturation greater than 93%.
Her wheezing on examination would decrease and she would begin to move more air and her saturation would come up to the mid to low 90s.
Attempts to wean her nebulized treatments were unsuccessful and the patient continued to require them approximately every 3.5 to 4.5 hours through her entire stay until her date of discharge.
A repeat echocardiogram was not obtained as the patient had no episodes of chest pain, no episodes of tachycardia or other rhythm abnormalities and on clinical examination was not in failure, either left or right sided.
The last echocardiogram obtained prior to discharge from transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the general medicine floor showed an ejection fraction of 40% with clean coronaries.
The presumed diagnosis is a myocarditis which should improve with time, however, repeat echocardiogram was not performed.
The patient was screened for short term rehabilitation without response until [**2137-11-25**], when [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1612**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5553**] stated they could take the patient and handle her pulmonary issues including monitoring oxygenation and nebulized treatments.
Attempts to wean the oxygen and space out the nebulized treatments were unsuccessful.
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1612**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5553**] is aware of this and is ready to accept the patient upon transfer.
