CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2106-2-15**] 4:20 PM  CHEST CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Emphysema is again noted, with multiple bullae in the middle and upper lobes.
There is an approximately 4 cm hypodense lesion in the lower pole of the spleen, unchanged compared to the [**2106-2-13**] abdominal CT, which may represent a splenic infarction.
Increased number and size of mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes, which may be reactive.
[**2106-2-13**]  11:08:22 PM  EKG  Sinus tachycardia.
[**2106-2-13**] 3:20 PM  CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: Hazy nodular opacities about the airways within the lower lungs have increased since the prior study consistent with small airways disease.
The appendix contains contrast within it and gas, possibly from prior CT scan.
There is no persistent staining on the delayed images, nor is there contrast within the kidneys on the pre- contrast CT remaining from [**2106-2-11**] angiogram.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder has a Foley catheter within it and is incompletely distended.
Subsequent administration of rectal contrast shows no leakage of contrast and no other abnormality.
CT ARTERIOGRAM WITH IV CONTRAST: There is diffuse atherosclerotic plaque within the aorta with a large amount of plaque within the infrarenal aorta.
This is best demonstrated on series 2, 3, and 4, images 90-94 and series 6 B, images 186-189.
If clinically indicated, high resolution chest CT could be performed.
