In [**2141-10-22**] her LFTs were elevated at an annual doctor's appointment.
Pt reports a weight gain from 105 (her nl wt) to 112.
She said that an ECG has been done previously to evaluate this and she was not aware of any abnormalities.
Physical Exam: --Vitals: Tc 98.4     HR 88 and irreg irreg    90/60    RR 18 --General: Small woman lying comfortably in bed in NAD.
Carotid pulses 2+ bilaterally; upstrokes brisk; without bruits.
Flank dullness, shifting dullness, and fluid wave are present.
--Extremities: Radial (2+) , post tib (1+) , and DP (1+) pulses intact bilaterally.

Autoimmune serologies done before this hospitalization were not conclusive.
During this hospitalization [**Doctor First Name **] was 1:1200 with IgG >150% of nml, however, liver biopsy showed no evidence of autoimmune hepatitis.
Transjugular bx on HD7 showed: 1) Moderate lobular predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate with numerous intracytoplasmic hyaline and mild fatty change; 2)Trichrome stain shows marked sinusoidal fibrosis with architectural distortion.
Reticulin stain evaluated; 3) No features  of autoimmune hepatitis are seen; 4) No iron seen on special stain; Note: The findings are consistent with toxic metabolic injury.
However, due to increased ALT and AST on HD20, Prednisone 20mg was reinstituted.
Total bilirubin increased steadily during admission from 8.1 to 21.
ALT reached 165 and AST reached 256. .
Dx paracentesis on HD2 showed no SPB (WBC 81) and portal-hypertension etiology (SAAG > 1.1).
Dx paracentesis on HD9 showed no SBP(WBC 76).
Decreased urine output starting on HD8, concerning for hepatorenal.
Foley catheter placed to better monitor urine output.
Considered using Octreotide, Midodrine, and Albumin in MICU if urine output dropped lower.
Patient responded to fluid challege and diuretics; her urine output increased by HD14-15.
On HD21-22 her urine output started to decline again and she began to have significant volume overload.
Her BUN and Cr began to rise.
Renal was consulted and felt urine sediment was consistent with pre-renal/hepatorenal, rather than ATN.
3) Hypoxemia On HD26 patient developed hypoxic respiratory distress with oxygen saturation that decreased to 86% off nasal cannula and increasing respiratory rate.
CXR showed pulmonary edema likely due to volume overload from renal failure.
ABG was within normal limits, however, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for more aggressive monitoring due to her respiratory status and decreased UOP with possible need for hemodialysis.
CXR with infiltrates suggesting PNA.
She was started on Metronidazole for emipiric C diff treatment and stool cultures were obtained which came back positive for C diff.
Her CXR showed significant bowel distention.
CT scan was deferred as care was redirected to comfort measures only.
In the MICU she was started on hypertonic saline which improved her serum sodium slightly.
7) Prophylaxis: Pt did not receive DVT prophylaxis due to INR >2.0.
A family meeting was arranged with her husband, brother, the liver attending, MICU attending and renal attending.
An autopsy was deferred by the family.
