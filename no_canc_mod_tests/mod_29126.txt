Neurosurgery was consulted for the subdural hemorrhage and lumbar spine fractures found on CT scan.
They recommended a repeat head CT with no intervention being necessary at that time.
Lactate was elevated at 4.
A bladder pressure measured 30-35mmHg.
A repeat head CT also on hospital day 2 was stable over the prior scan.
A CT scan of the wrist demonstrated a right thumb [**Doctor Last Name 65097**] fracture as well as a nondisplaced R distal radius fracture and a R trapezium fracture.
However, pt was not appropriately arousable on hospital day 7, so a repeat head CT was performed.
The abdominal staples have been removed, but there is still a small area at the bottom of the wound that is open.
