OSH head CT was normal.
She subsequently ruled out for MI and underwent a phamacological stress test with nuclear imaging that revealed small reversible defect of the inferior apical wall and a TTE that showed EF 55-60% and mild-moderate AS.
Her course was complicated by dificult to control hyperglycemia (BG up to 800s) requiring 80 [**Location 16422**]500 TID, 20 units of novolog with meals and prn IV insulin to maintain BG in 300-400 range.

While at [**Hospital1 1474**] she had a pharmacologic stress test showing a small inferoapical reversible defect; TTE showed EF 55-60% and mild-moderate AS.
Glucose was brought under control in the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU.
Admission U/A was consistent with UTI, and urine cultures grew cipro resistant, nitrofurantoin sensitive E. Coli.
She was transferred to the floor where she continued her course of nitrofurantoin, was followed closely by [**Last Name (un) **] for her diabetes, and was diuresed due to her decompensated diastolic heart failure.
Her hyperglycemia remained within her baseline range, 200-300, on a sliding scale with U-500 given four times a day at specific times similar to when she might take her insulin at home.
To meet this goal we increased her IV lasix from 20mg [**Hospital1 **] to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] in addition to the metolazone.
# CAD: When the patient arrived on the ICU, she was complaining of SOB and chest pain, for which she had multiple unchanged EKGs from prior.
Chest pressure in the AM is common for her and is not what she considers her angina.
A panorex film was taken, but not officially read prior to discharge.
While in the ICU, her steroid dose was decreased to 10 mg daily, with an eventual goal of weaning her off prednisone, which has been attempted in the past unsuccessfully.
# CKD: Unclear as to baseline renal function but OSH lab data showed Cr 1.4-1.5.
Her Cr trended down throughout her admission to a discharge Cr of 1.1.
Calcium 500 + D 500 mg(1,250mg) -400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
While at [**Hospital1 1474**], you had a stress test done on your heart that showed a small area of low blood flow; you elected not to undergo cardiac catheterization due to your shortness of breath while lying flat.
You were monitored on telemetry for several days due to some episodes of fast heart rate, which gradually became less frequent.
You also had some tooth pain, which was evaluated by both a dentist and an oral surgeon; they recommended having the tooth extracted as an outpatient.
- Please begin taking lisinopril 5mg daily - Please increase you Lasix (furosemide) to 80mg twice daily - Please continue to take only 10mg prednisone daily, which is half of your admission dose - Please adjust your home insulin U-500 dosing to 90 units at breakfast, 100 units at lunch, 60 units at dinner, and 60 units at bedtime as discussed with the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes doctors.
