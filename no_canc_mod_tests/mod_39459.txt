cta chest [**5-23**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
ct neck [**5-31**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**2184-6-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-2-28**], the severity of  tricuspid regurgitation may be lower (technical quality is suboptimal on both  studies).
Left ventricular  systolic function was likely underestimated on the prior study.
After placement of her trach, she continued to be diuresed with IV lasix prn with careful observation of her electrolytes given a history of contraction alkalosis.
She should be maintained on PO lasix and her electrolytes monitored while at rehab.
An ace was also started for afterload reduction.
An echo this admission showed diastolic dysfunction.
Her CVL was changed on [**6-18**] due to persistent temperature spikes.
In additon, after a CT torso showing only a LLL pna, she was treated with a second course of broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and cefepime to cover ventilator-associated pna), starting [**6-16**] for a planned eight day course.
Here, she became modestly hypotensive while on sedation and her calcium channel [**Month/Year (2) 7005**] was held; she was only treated with metoprolol given hypotension and was intermittently on heparin which was later stopped due to hematuria.
She never developed RVR and remained stable on a beta-[**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her calcium channel [**First Name3 (LF) 7005**] was stopped.
At discharge her INR was therapeutic (goal INR [**2-28**]), and should be checked weekly at rehab.
