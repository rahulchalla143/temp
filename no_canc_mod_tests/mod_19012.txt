PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile at 98.6; pulse 80; blood pressure 125/55; respiratory rate 18; oxygen saturation 96% on three liters.
Her abdominal examination is significant for softness and obese.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count was 21.3 with a left shift with 86% neutrophils; hematocrit of 40.5; platelets of 355.
Sodium of 149; potassium of 3.8; chloride of 103; bicarbonate of 36; BUN 49; creatinine 1.4; sugar of 252.
Her urinalysis shows positive nitrates and trace leukocyte esterase.
Her PT was 12.6; PTT was 23.2; INR was 1.1.
A CAT scan of the abdomen showed a large subcutaneous collection of air and soft tissue.
She had follow-up contrast studies, during which gastrografin was injected into both the jejunostomy and duodenostomy tubes.
The J tube contrast study showed that the J tube was in good position and there was no evident leak.
However, the duodenostomy contrast study showed a small amount of contrast exiting from the duodenal stump, indicating a slight leak from the duodenal stump.
This purulent material was washed out with high pressure saline and further inspection revealed that there was a small fascial dehiscence of the inferior aspect of Ms. [**Known lastname **] prior surgical wound.
Wound cultures taken during this procedure eventually grew out Vancomycin sensitive enterococcus, pseudomonas, [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans, the anaerobe Prevotella, for which Ms. [**Known lastname **] was put on intravenous antibiotics.
She underwent hemodynamic monitoring with an arterial line and Swan-Ganz catheter.
Blood cultures were sent.
Electrocardiogram, chest x-ray and arterial blood gases were all obtained; however, one of these tests resulted in a diagnosis.
She also received nebulizer treatments q. six and was oxygen saturation requiring because of oxygen saturations down into the mid 80's; however, her oxygen saturation would quickly climb back up with administration of oxygen via a shovel mask.
Towards the beginning of the month, a nitrogen balance was calculated and Ms. [**Known lastname **] was found to have a nitrogen balance of -7.5, clearly catabolic.
She was cultured and a urine culture on that day ended up growing out [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].
On [**1-23**], urine culture, after her five day course of bladder washings revealed that her urine had been cleared of the fungus.
Gradually, of note, no blood cultures have come back positive and she has been discontinued from all her intravenous and oral antibiotics as of [**1-25**].
Baseline weight was 72.7 kilograms.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a wrist x-ray obtained which did not show any fractures or any pathology.
