His JVD was elevated to the angle of the mandible.
He his respiratory rate was in the low 30's, heavily labored with a saturation of 94% on 5L facemask.
His pulmonary exam notable for diffuse inspiratory rales.
His BNP was elevated to 5000.
Despite brisk diureisis, his respirations were labored with respiratory rates in the 30s and oxygen saturation in the 90's on 6L facemask.
An EKG was performed which showed no dynamic changes concerning for ischemia.
His cardiac enzymes were negative.
He was actively diuresed with IV lasix to 193 lbs from an admission weight of 201 lbs.
He responded very well to the diuretics and upon discharge had an ambulatory saturation in the mid 90's on room air, no JVD, and no lower extremity edema.
Chronic Issues:  #Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Pulmonary function testing from 4 months ago show that Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**] has an FEV1 ~50% predicted and a FVC ~65% predicted.
Given his previous admissions for respiratory failure induced by pneumonia and crack-cocaine pneumonitis combined with his chest xray which showed diffuse infiltrates concerning for possible pneumonia.
# Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was maintained on his outpatient regimen of [**Hospital1 **] lantus with a sliding scale with [**Hospital1 **] sugars ranging in the 160s to low 200s.
His viral load was found to be 7 million copies.
