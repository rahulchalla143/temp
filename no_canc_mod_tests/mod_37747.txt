He was seen in the Emergency Department where his temperature was 100.5, and his respiratory rate was approximately 32, with a blood pressure of 145/64.
Chronic renal failure (with a baseline creatinine of 2.1).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on presentation revealed temperature was 100.5, blood pressure was 113/57, heart rate was 97 (in atrial fibrillation), respiratory rate was approximately 40, and the patient was saturating approximately 100% on nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed mucous membranes were dry.
His cardiovascular examination revealed a tachycardic heart that was irregular with faint heart sounds.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories upon presentation revealed white blood cell count was 10.7, hematocrit was 43.9, and platelets were 174.
Chemistry-7 was remarkable for a blood urea nitrogen of 74, and a creatinine of 2.5, with a glucose of 310.
Anion gap was 23.
His digoxin level was checked and was 1.
His first creatine kinase was checked and was 209, with a MB fraction of 18.
His troponin came back at 17.5.
His INR was 2 at this time.
An arterial blood gas was done.
Lactate level was 6.4.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 136 with a left bundle-branch block.
A chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate.
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  The patient ruled for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes due to demand ischemia; likely related to tachycardia from his anemia.
Because of his myocardial infarction, he went into new heart failure which was documented by a cardiac echocardiogram which documented a new ejection fraction during this hospital stay of about 20% to 25%.
ANEMIA SECONDARY TO GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient bled down to a hematocrit of approximately 34.
The Gastroenterology team saw the patient in consultation and decided not to do an upper endoscopy due to his acute myocardial infarction.
His hematocrit remained stable.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  He had a mild increase in his creatinine which basically resolved as his cardiac issues resolved.
