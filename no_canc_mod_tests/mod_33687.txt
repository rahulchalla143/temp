Then, she underwent cardiac cath that showed myocardial bridge 2 weeks ago; she was stented and then started with bleeding.
She had an echocardiogram done that showed a poericardial effusion with 3cm surrounding all faces of heart; there were signs of tamponade.
Her INR was elevated and she received 10 mg of PO Vitamin K. Her WBC 10.4, HCT 32.6, PLT 400, Electrolytes 135/4.6 98/26 19/0.8 and gluc of 165.
AST 43, ALT 53, AP 105, CPK 67, Trop T <0.01, NT-proBNP 369.
Given the posibility of bleeding through the myocardial bridge that was stented she was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
In the cath lab her pressures were  PCW 35/36/32, HR 109, PA 43/33/38, RV 47/25/30, dP/dt 624, RA 31/31/29, AO 131/88/104.
Coronary angiogram showed normal [**Hospital1 **], long stent in mid LAD and intra-myocardial segment widely patent; 30% of narrowing proximal to stent, no perforation prior o after pericardioscentesis.
They drained 970cc of bloddy fuild, which was sent to the lab.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
No echo evidence of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-8-24**], most of the pericardial fluid has been removed.
Echocardiogram [**2186-8-25**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Echocardiogram [**2186-8-28**]: There is a promient partially echofilled anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-8-25**], the findings are similar.
Cardiac Cath: [**2186-8-24**] Coronary angiogram showed normal [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] stent in mid LAD and intra-myocardial segment widely patent; 30% of narrowing proximal to stent, no perforation prior o after pericardioscentesis.

EKG: Atrial fibrillation with variable ventricular conduction and a ventricular heart rate of 80 BPM.

CXR [**2186-8-25**]: Left pectoral pacemaker in situ.
The most lateral right part of the hemithorax are not included on the image.
INR was supratherapeutic (3.5 in our hospital).
Pt was given 10 mg of PO vitamin K. She had an echocardiogram showing global pericardial effusion without apparent loculations of 3 cm and signs of tamponade.
On admission here patient had signs of tamponade on echocardiogram and was taken to the cardiac cath lab.
Her pressures were PCW 35/36/32, HR 109, PA 43/33/38, RV 47/25/30, dP/dt 624, RA 31/31/29, AO 131/88/104; 970 cc of bloody pericardial fluid were drained (HCT of 12).
Gram stain was negative and culture has been negative so far.
Patient went to the cardiac care unit for observation overnight with pericardial drained placed.
Serial echocardiograms showed minimal ammount of fluid, but a mass in apex that most-likely represents a clot, but cannot rule out fat pad (to big and distal make it unlikely).
Rhythm - Patient with PAFib rate controlled with diltiazem 120 mg daily and was anticoagulated at home with 10 mg of coumadin.
She was supra-therapeutic with INR of 3.5 on admission.
Her CHADS2 score is 1 having a ~2% annual risk of stroke, which would be similar to the risk of bleeding with a therapeuric anticoagulation and even higher in supra-therapeutic range.
