Breath sounds were coarse at the bases with rare rales.
The rectal examination was negative with no stool.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission to the Floor some hours later was as follows:  Temperature 96.9 F.; blood pressure 162/90; pulse 90; respirations 20; 96% on two liters.
Cardiac examination was unremarkable.
The abdomen was soft with positive bowel sounds, not significantly distended, but some minor tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant.

Stool studies are pending at the time of discharge.
Urine culture showed 10 to 100,000 organisms of Proteus mirabilis.
Chest x-ray on [**3-3**], was as follows:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
A chest CT scan performed on the same day showed no pulmonary embolus, left pleural and parenchymal calcifications and left lower lobe volume loss, i.e.
The head CT scan was performed on [**3-4**], with the following impression:  No intracranial hemorrhage, no evidence of skull fracture.
Hip x-rays are pending at the time of this dictation.
The patient's EKG was felt to represent tachycardia with left bundle branch block but without other pathology.
Secondary to concerns surrounding the additional history that the patient gave of a fall approximately three days prior to admission with racoon's eyes on examination, the patient was sent for a CT scan of the head to rule out intra-cranial bleeding or base of the skull fracture.
Stool studies were sent which are pending at the time of this discharge.
On [**3-4**], the patient was thought to be much improved with no significant abdominal tenderness and no Telemetry events overnight with a pulse in the 80s and systolic blood pressure in the 160s.
As the patient had formerly multiple times been evaluated for abdominal pain including mesenteric angiography and CT scan of the abdomen without a diagnosis being reached, the decision was made to discharge the patient home or appropriate outpatient follow-up with her outpatient provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
