In the ED, BNP was found to be [**Numeric Identifier 31854**], but CXR did not reveal gross volume overload.
Cardiac enzymes showed elevated troponin (but this is at his baseline given his acute on chronic renal failure) and CKs were flat.
His initial vitals revealed T 98.0 HR 120 BP 88/40 and RR in the 20s with O2 sats of 88% on RA.

The  estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2137-10-2**], the right ventricular cavity now appears dilated with free wall  hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed.
CXR [**1-16**]: Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is chronic.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypoxemia: On admission, CXR did not reveal pulmonary edema nor infiltrate to suggest CHF, despite elevated BNP, or pneumonia as contributors to his hypoxemia.
Because of the worsening right heart function, a V/Q scan was pursued given persistent concern for PE (renal failure prevented CTPA).
V/Q scan performed [**1-15**] showed low probability of PE so heparin gtt was d/c'd.
Additionally, V/Q scan revealed e/o R-->L shunt, thus suggesting shunt as likely cause of his transient, posititionally related hypoxemia.
Left sided pneumothorax from left 8th rib fracture was evaluated by thoracics in the ED and remained stable on follow up imaging.
# CHF: [**2139-1-14**] EF was found to be depressed slightly to 25% compared to EF 30% on echo [**10-2**].
He was found to have worsened RV function on this echo, but as above, V/Q scan showed low probability for PE.
EKG did not reveal e/o acute ischemic changes and CKs were flat.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine appears 1.4-1.5; admission creatinine was 1.9.
Despite elevated BNP, his pulm exam did not reveal significant crackles and he did not appear grossly overloaded.
Creatinine improved to his BL (1.4).
Echo and V/Q raised the possiblity that he may be getting transiently hypoxemic while ambulating if R-->L shunt occurs and this may be contributing to his falls or causing the confusion at the time of the fall.
He had awoken in the middle of night and walked to the bathroom using his walker; his LPN was at his bedside and helped him.
He was pronounced dead and his family was notified along with his PCP's office.
