Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis can be seen, more extensive compared to prior study obtained on [**2138-9-22**].
The amount of pleural effusion has also increased compared to prior study of [**2138-9-22**].
STRESS MIBI:  RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA: 9.2 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Tetrofosmin Rest ([**2138-10-20**]); 30.2 mCi Tc-99m Tetrofosmin Stress ([**2138-10-20**]); HISTORY: 67 year old woman with CAD and CHF, admitted for recurrent episodes of pulmonary edema, evaluate for perfusion defects.
IMAGING METHOD: Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m tetrofosmin.
Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 36%.
Moderately enlarged left ventricule with calculated EF of 36%.

ENT evaluated for fistula revision which was deemed unnecessary at this time.
CHF: Stress MIBI indicated EF 30-35% which is slightly decreased from last LVEF of 45-50% with evidence of systolic failure and moderate MR.  CHF thought to be ischemic in nature.
CAD: Stress EKG showed no ischemic changes.
