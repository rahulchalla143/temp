Admission chest x-ray showed an increased cardiomegaly and EKG with new left axis deviation.
Blood cultures times three and ASB smear times three were negative.
Chest CT Scan showed multiple ill defined nodules throughout both lungs, small left pleural effusion and 1.6 times 2.2 cm low attenuation lesion in the right hepatic lobe and evidence of prior infarcts in the left and right kidney.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's initial vitals on physical examination were a temperature of 101.5 F, heart rate 96, blood pressure 120/40, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal and reactive to light.
INITIAL LABORATORIES:  CBC 12.6, 31.4, 309, 66 neutrophils, 3 bands, 15 lymphs.
Baseline creatinine 1.4 to 1.6.
Chest x-ray as noted above.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was referred for bronchoscopy to evaluate right lower lobe lesion versus septic emboli.
Bronchoscopy on [**9-28**] revealed no intrabronchial lesions.
Bronchoalveolar lavage obtained from posterior right upper lobe.
TEE on [**9-27**] revealed 4+ AR, 2+ MR, dilated LV cavity, PA systolic hypertension and large anterior and posterior echo-free space possibly representing a paravalvular abscess.
Levophed with SBP 93 to 100.
on [**2158-11-7**], the patient's chest wall was closed.
The patient remains persistently febrile with a leukocytosis and WBC up to [**Numeric Identifier **].
Blood cultures and Clostridium difficile were negative.
CT Scan of the abdomen was performed which showed some bowel wall thickening.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed gallbladder sludge, but no evidence of cholecystitis given profound leukocytosis and evidence of bowel wall thickening seen on CT Scan.
On [**11-14**] t bilirubin 7.4.
Anaerobic blood cultures on [**11-14**] showed [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and patient was started on AmBisome.
GI was consulted for evaluation of blood from trach and coffee-grounds in PEG site.
EGD showed a grade IV esophagitis, likely ischemic, with oozing in posterior pharynx.
CT Scan of the chest was obtained which revealed that esophagitis was not full thickness, no stranding or evidence of pneumomediastinum.
Blood cultures from [**11-14**] to [**11-17**] also grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].
Repeat echo showed resolution of AR, ejection fraction greater than 55%, 4+ MR which was increased from 2+ previous echo, but no evidence of endocarditis.
Neurology was reconsulted for persistent fascial twitching and EEG showed no seizure activity.
On [**11-10**], the patient had a head which revealed right mastoid air cell opacification.
On [**2158-11-29**], the patient underwent an ultrasound guided pleural tap.
Chest x-ray showed white out of the left hemithorax.
Hematocrit noted to fall from 30 to 15.
Hematocrit increased from 15 to 24.
Repeat CT Scan of chest to evaluate effusions showed interval increase in opacification within the left upper lobe which may represent an aspiration or infection.
Patient's chest tubes remained in place draining fluid for a few days.
Pleural cultures were sent for gram stain, anaerobic culture, fungal stain and culture which were negative.
The patient had a CT Scan of the chest to evaluate and possibly do a diagnostic tap at CT Scan.
Repeat CT Scan of the chest on [**12-20**] showed an interval decrease in the size of the small bilateral pleural effusions with a small amount of loculated fluid at the bases which was too small to tap.
Patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed no signs of cholecystitis.
Patient, however had repeat episodes of diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea which seemed responsive to Klonopin, Ativan and intermittently Haldol.
Patient had repeat echo on [**12-11**] which showed normal ejection fraction, no vegetation, MR 4+, TR 2+.
