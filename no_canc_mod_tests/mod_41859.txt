Patient was also noted to be febrile and cultures were sent.
In the ED: Vitals signs: T 100.6, HR 100, BP 120/75, 95% on RA .
On the floor, CT scan was amended to demonstrate submassive PE as described below.

Chest PA/Lateral - IMPRESSION: Prominence of bronchovascular markings, more on the right, and at the lung bases.
Findings could suggest congestion, bibasilar atelectasis, pleural effusion, more on the right, and/or pneumonia especially at the left lung base.
CTA chest - IMPRESSION: 1.
Recommend clinical correlation with risk factors, and if patient is high risk, a dedicated chest CT can be obtained in 6 months for further evaluation.
Portable chest - FINDINGS: The heart size is normal.
CT head - CONCLUSION: Chronic findings unchanged since [**Month (only) **] [**2154**].
CXR-FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-28**], there is little overall change.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
F with remote CVA, remote DVT, admitted with large bilateral pulmonary emboli, initially stable on floor but required ICU stay for hypercarbic respiratory failure  # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: PCO2 on ABG with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Head CT obtained on floor prior to ICU transfer which was negative.
CT exhibited evidence of right heart strain but echo showed intact RV function.
Pt should have her INR checked in [**1-11**] days.
Her calcium and vit D supplementation were stopped.
1L prn to keep sats >90% 13.
You were given water pill Lasix and IV fluids to lower the levels of blood calcium.
