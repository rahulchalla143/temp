Pertinent laboratory investigations for his transplant evaluation include his last PSA from [**2115**] of 6.3 and a stress test from [**9-/2115**] showing transient ischemic dilatation in addition to baseline left ventricular dilatation and an EF of 31% that decreased since his prior study.
He had a colonoscopy also in [**2112**] that was normal.
DM type 1 3.
CHF with EF 20-25% in [**9-/2115**] and severe MR. 6.

Due to minimally improved post-operative urine output (20-30cc/hr), a renal ultrasound was obtained, showing unremarkable appearance of the renal transplant.
Post-operatively, the patient also developed abdominal pain for which a portable abdominal x-ray was ordered showing mildly dilated loops of mostly large bowel consistent with an ileus, which subsequently resolved.
The patient was transferred to the ICU, where his cardiac enzymes were found to be negative x3.
An EKG at the time revealed anterior ST-T wave changes from the pre-operative EKG, and CXR revealed mild pulmonary edema.
An EKG on [**2117-1-22**] revelaed no new changes.
The patient was restarted on his pre-operative Coumadin dose ([**2117-1-20**]), with an INR on [**2117-1-26**] of 2.4.
Titrate to INR level 2.0-3.0.
