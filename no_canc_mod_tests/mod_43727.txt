ECG [**2127-11-21**]: Baseline artifact.
ECHO [**2127-11-24**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-8-13**], the left ventricular systolic function is similar and the severities of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitaiton have worsened.
1)Gram Negative Rod Bacteremia: Patient had blood and urine cultures positive for pansensitive E.Coli.
2)Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Patient had elevated cardiac enzymes in the setting of urosepsis, with peak troponin of 0.97, CK 232, MB 20.
Her metoprolol was held until her blood pressure improved.
She should also receive metoprolol as her blood pressure tolerates.
3) Acute on Chroninc Systolic Heart Failure: Patient presented with a BNP of 24,000 and clinical evidence of volume overload.
She has history of systolic HF with EF 20%.
Her repeat ECHO showed no significant change in left ventricular ejection fraction since previous ECHO, but worsening mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Cr 1.2 at time of discharge which is within her baseline.
9) Neuropathy: Gabapentin dose was decreased to 300 mg [**Hospital1 **] from 600 mg [**Hospital1 **] when creatinine was increased.
You were started on the following New medications: -Ciprofloxacin: this is an antibiotic for your blood and urine infections -Metorprolol- this is a medication for your blood pressure that you have been on in the past.
