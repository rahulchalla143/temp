While in the ICU, EKG showed  ST depressions in lateral precordial leads.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and normal.
His urine grew out pansensitive E Coli and cefepime was swithced to cipro and was dsicharged on a total 5 day course.
His uric acid level was 9.1 However, decision regarding starting allopurinol was deferred as pt asymptomatic and recent flare.
CXR did not show any pulmonary edema but did show an opacity in the RLL.
This could have signified an aspiration pnuemonia however he notably has had a RLL opacification on prior CXR in [**2101**] making aspiration event less likey.
Patient received a TTE which showed EF 55%, however was unable to comment on diastolic function.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
