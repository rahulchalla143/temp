CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ([**2108-10-18**]): Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
Successful PTCA, thrombectomy and stenting of the proximal LAD (distal to the first diagonal) with a Driver (3x30mm) bare metal stent postdilated with a 3.0mm balloon.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA comments).
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertension with BP 152/106.
CTA CHEST/ABD/PELVIS ([**2108-10-18**]): CTA OF THE CHEST: No acute aortic pathology including no dissection.
BONE WINDOWS: Severe compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body with retropulsion of bony fragments into the canal and acute kyphotic angulation is unchanged in comparison to [**2107-8-22**].
.. TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2108-10-19**]): The left atrium is elongated.
LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary of severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall.
Tissue doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure(PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-9-26**], extensive anteroapical infarct now evident, with apical thrombus.
[**2108-10-24**] CXR : Preliminary report indicates resolution of prior parenchymal opacities, no pleural effusions or infiltrates.
Mild basilar bronchial thickening as noted in prior CXR studies still present.
[**2108-10-26**] CT HEAD:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major territorial infarction.
MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of acute infarction.
[**2108-10-26**] CT ABD/PELVIS : 1.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2108-10-26**] the T wave abnormalities are more prominent in the precordial leads.
[**2108-11-1**] EKG : Normal sinus rhythm with intraventricular conduction defect of the left bundle-branch block variety.

Post cardiac catheterization he presented to the CCU with acute onset pulmonary edema and respiratory failure and was intubated on assist control ventilation.
Serial CXRs showed resolution of the pulmonary edema and the patient's oxygen saturation levels have been consistently >97% on room air.
PPD testing done with a negative PPD confirmed on [**2108-10-27**].
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: In terms of Mr.[**Known lastname 11013**] coronary artery disease, he underwent catheterization at admission with BMS placed to LAD.
His CK peaked at 76 and his TropT peaked at 0.66.
After the catheterization, there were no further episodes of chest pain with the exception of some mild [**2110-2-26**] intermittent chest pain on [**2108-11-1**] which was reproducible on exam and felt to be musculoskeletal in origin at the left sterno-costal junction.
EKG showed t-wave inversions in V2-V5 which had been present in multiple prior EKGs, otherwise NSR, rate mid-70s and oxygen saturation 98% RA.
PUMP FUNCTION:Regarding pump function, the patient presented to the CCU with acute pulmonary edema on imaging in the setting of a recent MI.
A TTE after the cath showed LVEF of 30% and apical hypokinesis with LV mural thrombus.
To manage  his mural thrombus, he was started on a heparin drip and then bridged to Coumadin 2.5 mg qhs and his INR was 2.7 on [**2108-11-1**].
He was extubated without complications and was gradually weaned back to room air and had oxygen saturations of 97-99% on room air at time of discharge.
Pancreatic and liver enzymes were sent and all returned normal.
CT chest/[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis was negative for pulmonary or intra-aortic process.
Abdominal imaging was unremarkable.
However, on hospital day 1 his hematocrit dropped rather precipitously from 29 to 24.
His hematocrit increased to baseline mid 30s and remained stable for the rest of the hospitalization.
Ultimately, blood pressure was well controlled with a triple regimen of 5mg daily Lisinopril, Clonidine patch and 25mg PO BID Metoprolol.
Pt will need a repeat LE ultrasound in [**1-25**] months to assess for interval change.
The patient's compliance with his INR checks at [**Company 191**] and the importance of taking his daily Warfarin to prevent strokes and additional clots or complications was stressed and reinforced on multiple occasions.
.. # DEPRESSION / ANXIETY:  Stable; we continued his home duloxetine, clonazepam, and quetiapine initially and Psychiatry was consulted for additional input during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay and the patient's Seroquel was increased to 200mg qhs dosing alongside 50mg [**Hospital1 **] prn Seroquel regimen as well.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on Wednesday [**11-8**] and call results to [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2173**] 13.
Warfarin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Please check INR on [**11-8**].
[**2108-11-5**]: INR 2.2, Hct 25.7  Stable.
Labs [**2108-10-31**] : Hct 26.6, INR 2.7 [**2108-10-31**] : BUN 20, Cr 1.2   Discharge Instructions:  You had a heart attack and a bare metal stent was placed in your left coronary artery to keep it open.
