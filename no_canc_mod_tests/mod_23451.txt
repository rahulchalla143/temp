ECHO on [**2180-5-23**]: very mild narrowing of the isthmus, no posterior [**Last Name (un) 67468**], no obstruction; small to moderate PDA with bidirectional flow; good biventricular function.
ECHO on [**2180-5-25**]: small PDA with bidirectional flow, no arch obstruction, right ventricular hypertension, and good left ventricular systolic function.
Serial 4-extremity blood pressures have also been normal with upper to lower systolic gradiants in the [**2-20**] nnHg range (normal less than 10).
The infant continues to have a murmur and his baseline heart rate is 60-80.
