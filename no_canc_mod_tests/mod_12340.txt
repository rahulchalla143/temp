Per report, repeat echo revealed preserved EF.
Head CT was negative for ICH.
She was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] where she underwent cardiac catheterization and had BMS placed to a 60% proximal RCA lesion with positive resting gradient by pressure wire.
She required 4L of O2 by facemask to keep her oxygen saturations in the mid 90s.
Her LVEDP was 30.
CARDIAC HISTORY: prior Non-Q wave MI in [**4-13**] - CABG: None - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: Cardiac cath in [**4-13**] with BMS placed to RCA (severe mid 90% lesion and diffuse 70% mid disease) - PACING/ICD: None 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: as above, additionally -peripheral neuropathy -bilateral carotid stenosis (50-60%) -osteomyelitis/gangrene of right fourth toe s/p amputation in [**2182-5-4**] -s/p right SFA stenting in [**4-13**] -s/p L iliac angioplasty in [**2167**] -cataract surgery   Social History: - Retired nurse - Exercises daily - Tobacco history: currently uses [**2-6**] pack/week since age 16 - ETOH: denies - Illicit drugs: denies  Family History: - Father had CAD, MI in 60s, died from complications of cancer  Physical Exam: VS: 98.2, 69, 174/50, 23, 97% GENERAL: NAD.
NECK: Supple with JVP at angle of mandible while supine.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e, + right femoral bruit SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas Pulses: faint DP & PT pulses b/l   Pertinent Results: Right and Left Heart Catheterization: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart filling pressures.
The cardiac output and index were normal as was the SVR.
Selective angiography of the bilateral renal arteries revealed no angiographically significant disease.
Per report, the day prior to transfer her pressures were elevated and supplemental labetalol was given.
During catheterization the patient was maxed on a nitroglycerin gtt, then started on a nitroprusside gtt to keep her SBPs <180.
She was easily weaned off the Nitroglycerine gtt and her blood pressure remained well controlled.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Patient presented to OSH with acute dyspnea, and had CXR findings of pulmonary edema and elevated troponin (peak 0.6, CKMB flat).
An echocardiogram obtained at the OSH revealed preserved EF of 55%, mild MR, mild TR, mod elevated PAP, and mild LVH.
She was transferred to our hospital and underwent cardiac catheterization where her LVEDP was noted to be 30.
BNP was elevated at 2891.
Clinical exam revealed bibasilar rales.
Her creatinine was 1.2 on admission (baseline likely 1.5 based on OSH records), peaked at 4.3, and began to trend down.
Her creatinine was 3.3 at discharge.
She presented to OSH with elevated troponins (peak 0.62) in setting of CHF and chest discomfort.
She was transferred for cardiac catheterization which revealed diffuse, but non-critical plaquing of LAD and LCx, and 60% proximal RCA stenosis, for which a BMS was placed.
Her EKG remained stable from baseline.
Ultrasound was obtained and negative for pseudoaneurysm.
Given she had been on a heparin gtt, a head CT was obtained and negative for ICH.
We performed a delirium work up (B12, folate, TSH, RPR), as well as obtained a urinalysis, which were negative for gross abnormalities.
Hgb A1c of 9.9 indicating need for tighter control.
# Chronic Normocytic Anemia: History of guaiac + stools, but prior evaluation of GI tract has been negative.
Her hematocrit was closely monitored and remained relatively stable.
Given that her Fe studies reflected iron deficiency, this should continued to be monitored and evaluated by her Primary Care Physician after discharge.
