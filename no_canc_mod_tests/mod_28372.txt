In the ED, VS were T98.6  HR 127 RR 35 and 100% on NRB.
Labs notable for WBC of 15.7, lactate of 2.5 and BNP of 1719.
CXR was reportedly unchanged from prior with extensive biilateral infiltrates.
Past Medical History: - pulmonary fibrosis - seasonal allergies - s/p c-section - s/p breast reduction   Social History: lives at home with husband, previously worked as banking clerk but unable to work since decline in functional status.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-5-10**], the detected pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower.
Microbiology: blood cx: [**10-14**] NTD urine cx: [**10-14**]: no growth  Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo/f with likely pulmonary fibrosis presenting with progressively worsening dyspnea with high A-a gradient requiring 100% NRB to maintain oxygen saturations in the low 90s%.
CXR on admission with worsening bilateral infiltrates, which was most consistent with acute worsening of likely pulmonary fibrosis.
As patient was too unstable for CT scan or brochoscopy, she was also initiated on empiric therapy for PCP PNA with IV bactrim.
A echo with bubble study did reveal a PFO, suggesting that right to left shunting could be exacerbating hypoxemia, further treatment of this was not pursued.
A trial of NIPPV was attempted but poorly tolerated by patient.
As per family wishes a post-mortem exam will be pursued.
