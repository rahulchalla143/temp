CT scan showed small left sulcal hyperdensity, over the left parietal lobe, suspicious for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Patient underwent a CTA/CTV of the head (though suboptimal in quality due to lack of peripheral access) and CT of torsal.
CHF with RV dysfunction [**1-14**] to OSA 5.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-4-24**], the findings are similar.
CT HEAD on [**7-13**] 1.
CTA/CTV was not performed due to lack of IV access.
CT TORSO on [**7-13**] 1.
Suboptimal evaluation due to hand injection of IV contrast.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
An echo was done and the patient required 4 pressors in order to keep MAPs in the 60s.
His home medications for HTN and Afib were held in the setting of hypotension, and cultures were taken for the possible infectious cause.
Ultimately, after much of the workup could be completed, the patient's wife opted for comfort care, and he was taken off of the four pressors and made comfortable.
&#9658; SEIZURE vs STROKE: imaging suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage, not for surgical intervention.
A neuro and neurosurgery c/s were called in the ED, and the patient was not a surgical candidate.
An EEG was ordered, however this study could not be completed after he was made CMO.
His CT chest notable for b/l pleural effusions with RLL segmental collapse.
&#9658; ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) on Coumadin with high INR - given subarachnoid bleed, he was reversed with profilnine, vitamin K, and FFP.
