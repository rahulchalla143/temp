CT HEAD NECK [**3-26**]: FINDINGS: The patient is intubated with the tip of the ventilation tube above the carina.
CT HEAD: The cerebral sulci, ventricles, and extra-axial CSF-containing spaces have normal size and configuration.
TTE [**3-27**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
CT HEAD [**3-30**]: 1.
If there is concern for acute infarction, an MRI can be performed if not CI.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CXR [**3-31**]: 1.
Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular markings, also grossly unchanged.
He was cooled to 32 degrees celsius for about 16 hours and rewarmed early, as he had no evidence of renal or hepatic dysfunction, negative cardiac enzymes and his echocardiogram did not have any evidence of systolic or diastolic dysfunction, which made a primary arrest event unlikely.
# Respiratory failure: patient was initially intubated by EMS in the setting of a possible arrest, and initially had a P:F ratio that suggested acute lung injury, thought to be due to an aspiration event.
His oxygenation improved over the next few days, but he spiked a fever and his sputum production increased along with a worsening left basilar consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
His sputum culture grew out Staph aureus which speciated out to MSSA.
He underwent an MRI which was negative for acute focal damage and his labs did not show evidence of electrolyte abnormalities, toxicities (besides alcohol), or infection.
His TSH and B12 were normal.
Blood, urine, sputum all sent for culture and sputum grew out Staph aureus (MSSA) as well as GNR.
# Transaminitis: very mild on admission and trended down over the next 24-48 hours, hepatitis B and C serologies were negative and it thought to be due to his alcohol abuse.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please assist with alcohol/substance abuse counseling and detox - Consider work-up for obstructive sleep apnea and setting up CPAP.
This might help with his lethargy during the day time and his asthma symptoms - Please assist with physical therapy and occupational therapy  Medications on Admission: albuterol HFA furosemide 20 mg daily tramadol 50 mg prn loratidine 10 mg daily fluticasone 110mcg IH [**Hospital1 **] simvastatin 40 mg daily metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily aspirin prn?
- Please take a multivitamin daily - Please take acetaminophen for pain - You may use Miralax as needed for constipation.
