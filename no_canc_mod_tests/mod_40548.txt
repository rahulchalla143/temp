Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 - 40 %).
Biventricular systolic fxn is slightly improved, with an EF = 40 - 45%.
EP was consulted for pre-op VFib arrest and it was decided that the patient did not require an ICD, as his arrest was likely due to ischemia, his EF is good and he has been successfully re-vascularized.
Blood pressure would not tolerate initiation of ACE Inhibitor, but this should be considered in the outpatient phase of recovery.
