Echocardiography [**2163-6-27**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-8-7**], the gradient across the aortic valve is markedly increased and c/w severe aortic valve stenosis.
Coronary catheterization [**2163-6-30**]: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no angiographically signicant CAD.
On day 2 of hospitalization, a diagnostic thoracentesis was performed to clarify the cause of the pleural effusions.
As part of his work-up in the MICU, the patient got an echocardiogram.
The echo showed that the patient's bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis was present with thickened leaflets and markedly increased gradient consistent with severe aortic valve stenosis.
After his second day in the MICU, the patient was transferred to a step down unit where it was decided that he should undergo cardiac catheterization to rule out ischemia and better assess his aortic valve.
Cath showed clean coronaries, critical aortic stenosis (valve area 0.3cm) and a cardiac output of 1.3.
He was cleared by hepatology and ID for surgery and carotid ultrasounds were negative.
lasix gtt was stopped on [**7-2**] [**1-24**] hypotension (SBP 80s), sinus tachycardia (Hr90s) and Creatinine bump to 1.4.
Creatinine went back down to 1.2 that same day but lasix gtt continued to be held.
A RUQ US showed heterogeneous architecture suggestive of fatty liver and small ascites.
Hepatitis serologies were not suggestive of an acute infection.
Urine and serum tox screens were negative.
However, after the patient's echocardiogram revealed the significant sclerosis that had occured on his prosthetic aortic valve, it was believed that his transaminitis was most likely secondary to shock liver.
He was discharged to home on postoperative day seven when his INR was therapeutic.
Target INR is 2.5-3.0 for mechanical aortic valve.
