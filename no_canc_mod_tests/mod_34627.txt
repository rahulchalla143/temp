EKG demonstrated NSR at 82, with LVH and 1mm ST depressions and TWIs in I, inferior leads and v3-v6.
CK 152 with MB 6.3, trop 0.07, Cr 1.3, AST 97 ALT74 .
CT C-spine: FINDINGS: The patient is intubated and a nasogastric tube is present within the esophagus limiting evaluation of the prevertebral soft tissues.
CT Head: FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus or evidence of major territorial infarct is apparent.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Cardiac Catheterization: 1- Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated no angiographically-apparent coronary artery disease.
The LMCA, LAD, LCX and RCA had normal flow pattern.
3- Limited resting hemodynamic assesment revealed normal sustemic arterial pressure (108/57 mmHg) and mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures (LVEDP 15 mmHg post LV-gram).
4- Left ventriculography revealed normal systolic function (LVEF 60%) and no mitral regurgitation.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2178-3-24**] 8:34 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-17**], there has been placement of a ICD with its tip in the general area of the apex of the right ventricle.
ECG Study Date of [**2178-3-12**]  4:11:46 PM Sinus rhythm.
ECG Study Date of [**2178-3-13**]  8:04:36 AM Sinus bradycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing bradycardia has appeared.
ECG Study Date of [**2178-3-14**]  10:08:04 AM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-3-15**] T wave inversions in leads I, II, aVL, V2-V6 are either no longer present or are of much lower amplitude.
ECG Study Date of [**2178-3-15**]  8:36:14 AM Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-3-13**] no diagnostic interval change.
ECG Study Date of [**2178-3-20**]  7:49:58 AM Normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial contractions.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-3-15**] no diagnostic interval change.
ECG Study Date of [**2178-3-26**]  11:02:52 AM Sinus bradycardia Left ventricular hypertrophy Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - may be in part left ventricular hypertrophy and possible ischemia Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2178-3-20**], atrial ectopy absent and further ST-T wave changes seen  Brief Hospital Course: # Vfib Arrest: The patient had a Vfib arrest of unknown origin.
He had serial EKGs while hypothermic which revealed resolution of initial t-wave inversions and normalization of his EKG.
he underwent cardiac catheterization to investigate the etiology of his arrythmia.
Cardiac cath did not reveal significant coronary artery disease.
The lisinopril was limited by blood pressure.
# Mental status: Initially, the patient had poor mental status and neurological exam after extubation.
head CT did not reveal any acute intracranial process.
His potassium improved after discontinuing bactrim.
