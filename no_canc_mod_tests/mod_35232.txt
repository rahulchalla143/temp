CBC significant for WBC of 11.8, hct 35.2.
Chem7 significant for Cr 2.4 (baseline 1.0-1.2, [**5-/2195**]), UA negative, lactate 1.2, INR 3.3.
BNP [**2141**] (increased from 827 on [**5-/2195**]), trop neg X1, LFTs WNL.
Blood cultures drawn.
CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
Head CT prelim read showed no acute changes.
On transfer, pt's vitals were: 98.4 Tc rectally, HR 67, BP 126/58, RR 22, 99%2L NC.
NECK: No LAD, JVP 6-7cm.
Neuro/Psych: confused, and not cooperating with interview.
Patient with known diastolic CHF and history of CAD/MI is presenting with dyspnea, a 30lb weight gain, satting 97% on RA.
CXR and physical exam shows mild pulmonary edema suggestive of fluid overload, likely due to CHF exacerbation.
ECG unchanged from baseline.
Patient does not appear to be infected- no productive cough or signs of consolidation on exam, CXR did not show evidence of consolidation.
Abg at this time revealed hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Echo was performed which showed aortic stenosis, mild MR, 3+ TR, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
However, pt became increasingly agitated overnight and by morning of [**8-7**] O2 saturations dipped into 80s and SBP went into 190s.
Concern for flash pulmonary edema, but CXR looked unchanged from baselines.
Blood pressures improved on nitro gtt, and bipap was restarted.
Pt's O2 saturations initially improved on BIPAP but after several hours she became hypoxic again.
