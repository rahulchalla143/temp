The patient presented to her primary care physician's office a week prior to admission and was found to have a hematocrit of 26.
She was admitted to [**Hospital3 15174**] where she received two units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit bumped appropriately.
On routine labs at that time, she was found to have an increase in troponin level to 3.8, felt to be another ischemic event.
Peptic ulcer disease status post esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy on 01/[**2140**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 98/47 to 118/52; heart rate 81 to 94; the patient was afebrile and saturation of 97% on room air.
Cardiac examination is a regular rhythm with no murmurs.
LABORATORY:  Significant labs include hematocrit between 30 and 32.
In addition, a small pleural effusion consistent with blood was seen, that was felt to be smaller than the pleural effusion seen on the catheterization report two weeks earlier.
Also of note, in the distal left anterior descending, a small area of localized perforation consistent with a walled off perforation from prior catheterization or a small aneurysm were observed.
An echocardiogram was performed due to the pulsus paradoxus readings.
The pericardial effusion was felt to be smaller compared to the previous study of [**2140-11-1**].
With respect to her GI bleed, serial hematocrits were followed and remained stable throughout her hospital course.
They felt it most appropriate to follow-up with endoscopic studies once the patient was stable.
Troponin peaked at 15.8; maximum CK was 53.
