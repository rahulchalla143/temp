PFT's [**8-/2182**] FEV1/FVC 73% TLC 95% predicted DSB 39% predicted Mechanics: The FVC and FEV1 are moderately reduced.
CXR: Limited study due to apical lordotic positioning of the patient and lack of visualization of the left costophrenic angle.
CT trachea w/ forced expiratory maneuver [**2183-11-24**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study, pulmonary pressures not obtainable because of technically-inadequate tricuspid regurgitation jet.

Labs in ED remarkable for bicarb of 16, lactate 4.3, and WBC 6.9 with 92% PMNs.
Pt has diffuse wheezes on exam indicative of COPD flare, but may have a LLL infiltrate on CXR (difficult to tell as L costophrenic angle cut off from film).
Repeat CXR showed left lower lobe atelectasis, unilateral retrocardiac opacities which likely indicated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, but no  evidence of acute pneumonia.
Gave ATC ipratropium and albuterol nebs with albuterol q2 PRN.
