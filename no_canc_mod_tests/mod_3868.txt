Also got MRI of his kidneys which showed severe renal artery narrowing.
In ED, initial VS SBP in 60s, AF, pulse in 60s.

), ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF of 25 % on echo this admission), aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9 cm), PVD s/p b/l AKA, s/p renal transplant (baseline Cr 1.2 to 1.4) who was admitted for hypotension and nausea.
On presentation to ED SBP noted to be 60's pulse in 60s.
Initial Swan numbers revealed elevated PCWP of 23, PAP of 63/23, CVP 9, and SVR of 1300 consistent with cardiogenic shock and L ventricular overload.
Echo peformed on [**9-22**] revealed no significant changes from prior with EF of 25%, degree of AV stenosis was essentially unchanged.
His estimated PCWP has trended down since then with creatinine today 1.8 down from 2.2.
Serial chest x-rays revealed resolving pulmonary edema.
The patients creatinine was elevated on admission but slowly trended back to normal range by discharge.
Per his nephrologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], his cyclosporine levels were adequate.
There was some concern for rejection on a renal ultrasound but the patient's creatinine had returned to his baseline  Pt was extubated [**9-30**].
His blood pressure was generally stable (SBPs in 100-110 range).
His blood sugars were noted to trend downward and was found to be 31 in morning of [**10-6**].
Pt was also noted to have a hematocrit  that had trended down from 28 to 25 over the prior week.
Now off pressors, blood pressure w.n.l.
Pump:  EF 25%, aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9), CHF seems to be class II.
Status post cardiogenic shock--now resolved, appears secondary to increase in his blood pressure medications.
PVD: s/p b/l amputations -continue aspirin and plavix -will need physical therapy from extended hospital stay .
-CSA levels to be checked regularly -if creatinine levels rise, please check renal ultrasound -renally dose all medications .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cardiogenic shock.
Blood pressure stable.
