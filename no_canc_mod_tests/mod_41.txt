She was also seen by the Pulmonary service for evaluation of her pulmonary hypertension and episodes of apnea and they recommended an outpatient sleep study.
Given that over-ventilation and over-oxygenation was felt to contribute to the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence, the patient should have oxygen for a target oxygen saturation of 89-93%.
#Pulmonary nodules: Patient had sputum production and a chest CT which showed 3 left uppe lobe lung nodules that were most likely felt to be infectious.
She should have a follow up CXR in 6 weeks.
# Hypertension: Blood pressure was well controlled on home regimen.
# Transitional issues: AFB cultures will need to be followed-up She will need close pulmonary follow-up for repeat imaging in several weeks (fu of pulmonary nodules as well as follow up of her likely COPD, severe pulmonary hypertension, and probable sleep apnea .
The following changes were made to your medication regimen: 1) START guaifenesin  100 mg/5 mL Syrup  Sig:  Ten (10) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sputum production/cough 2) START albuterol 0.083% neb solution, 1 nebulizer every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing 3) You may use saline nasal spray as needed for nasal dryness.
