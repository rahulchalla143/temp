On POD #2 she had a temperature elevation to 102.3 as well as decreased oxygen saturation to 88%.
Additionally, a CXR showed evidence of pulmonary edema, basilar atelectasis, and possible pneumonia.
At her worst she had an A-a gradient of >500 and required oxygen by non-rebreather mask to acheive a oxygen saturation in the low 90's.
Diagnostic evaluation of her respiratory problems included CT angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism and cardiac ultrasound to r/o noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Cultures of the wound yielded sparse E.Coli, sensitive to multiple agents, and coag neg.
