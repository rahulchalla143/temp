Cath on [**8-1**] revealed LAD-50% mid; RCA-95% mid, distal filling into collaterals.
An ECHO on [**8-2**] showed preserved systolic dysfunction but impaired relaxation.
An ACE-i was not stated because of borderline BPs.
2) Arterial Perf (Ext Iliac/Common Fem)/Blood Loss Anemia: As noted, cath was complicated by external iliac/common femoral perforationAfter cath, HCT was down to 29.1 and pt had SBPs to 70s-80s.
Her HCT remained above 30 after the 3rd unit was given and her  SBPs ranged from 100-120s thereafter as well.
An Abd CT confirmed a retroperitoneal bleed: "Extraperitoneal stranding extending from the right kidney into the right deep pelvis consistent with retroperitoneal hemorrhage."
3) UTI: Her initial UA was positive and she was started on a 3 day course of Levofloxacin 500mg q24hr.
5) Pneumonia: At the conclusion of her course, she had mild decr of O2 sats from baseline (90-94%RA) and a CXR was read as mild RML PNA.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
