Right thoracoscopy 2.
Talc pleurodesis 4.
She underwent a thoracoscopy with partial lung decortication and a mechanical as well as talc pleurodesis.
CT imaging demonstrated a fibrothorax as well and trapped lung.
Her BUN and creatinine were elevated preoperatively.

FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2172-5-18**]):    NO GROWTH.

Lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages and rare mesothelial   cells.
[**5-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-15**] and 2 at 5:39 a.m.:  Lung volumes only mildly lower following tracheal extubation.
[**5-18**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-15**] through [**5-17**]:  Low lung volumes suggest this film was taken at suboptimal inspiration accounting for worsening atelectasis in the region of surgery at the base of the right lung.
Two of the chest tubes appear somewhat acutely angulated.
[**5-22**] CXR: Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2172-5-21**].
Post operatively she was noted to be tachycardic with a heart rate ranging from 115-130.
This was noted to be a sinus tachycardia and as her blood pressure was stable and she was not hypoxic it was felt to be secondary to pain and hypovolemia.
Postoperatively her renal function was stable with a creatinine of 1.4 initially on POD1.
The air leak resolved after several days and the CT output was minimal at the time of removal.
One CT was removed on POD 7 and the second was removed on POD 8 with only a small, stable apical pneumothorax noted after removal.
