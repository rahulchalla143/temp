She had been called to go back to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital3 418**] on [**7-23**] with 40% bands and increased white blood count.
Two out of two blood cultures grew out Proteus.
Her systolic blood pressures were in the 60s and heartrate in the 150s.
She had Swan-Ganz catheter placed via left internal jugular, but the patient had cardiac arrhythmias and tachycardia so this was changed to a triple lumen.
On [**7-25**], her right internal jugular Swan was placed with PAD 30/20, PCWP 14 and CVP at 10.
Peak CK was 316, MB 19 on [**7-24**].
Troponins were 8.8.
The only positive blood culture was Proteus in two out of two bottles.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission to [**Hospital6 256**] revealed temperature 37.8, heartrate 82, blood pressure 129/65, peripheral pulses 38/18, CVP 17, CVP 11.
Cardiac output 8.3.
Arterial blood gases on admission was 7.43, 36 and 64.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, sclera clear.
Cardiovascular examination, tachycardia, normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs.
LABORATORY DATA:  White cell count 8.8, neutrophils 76, lymphocytes 17.
Hematocrit 31.3, platelets 153.
PTT 23.1, INR 1.2, sodium 143, potassium 3.7, chloride 109, carbon dioxide 25, BUN 16, creatinine 0.5, glucose 123, CK 39, calcium 8.2, phosphate 3.4, magnesium 1.8.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, rate 80, normal axis.
Echocardiogram was done [**7-24**], positive for congestive heart failure with ejection fraction 30-35, normal valves.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Bronchiolar lavage and bronchoscopy were done on [**7-29**] while the patient was in the MICU for hemoptysis and adult respiratory distress syndrome.
Gram stain was negative.
Cultures were sent.
The next day, [**7-30**], abdominal computerized tomography scan was performed, revealing pleural effusions bilaterally.
Cardiovascular - Her blood pressures were stable and blood pressure medications adjusted to increase ACE-inhibitor up to 25 mg per day, Lasix was stopped once the patient was on the floor.
She was continued on statin, aspirin and continued to do well on antihypertensives with blood pressures in the normal range.
Prophylaxis - Ms [**Known lastname 42951**] was receiving Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Urosepsis 2.
three times a day, to be held for systolic blood pressures less than 100 and diastolic blood pressures less than 60 8.
b.i.d., hold for heartrate less than 55 and systolic blood pressure less than 90  DISCHARGE CONDITION:  She was transferred in house bed with physical therapy goals to return to baseline and good rehabilitation potential.
