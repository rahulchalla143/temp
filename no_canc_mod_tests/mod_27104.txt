A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show normal blood flow and tracer distribution.
Dynamic blood pool images were initially unremarkable, but subsequently demonstrated brisk bleeding first noticed at approximately 70 minutes.
IMPRESSION: GI bleeding study is positive for bleed, which appears located in the left upper quadrant, most likely in small bowel. "
Her HCT decreased and was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
In the ICU she continued to have bleeding and underewent a tagged RBC scan which was positive and demonstrated bleeding in the jejunum at 70 mins.
IR angio was willing to intervene but patient was nervous about signing consent.Then patient began to have hourly large maroon and red bowel movements.
Patient's HCT then remained stable since her last transfusion at 2:00 1 am on [**2159-12-1**].
Her HCT also remained stable.
GI did not think an EGD or colonoscopy would be of benefit given that the RBC scan was + at jejenum.
Addendum - right before dicharge, pt had a dark BM which was guaiac pos.
Vitals were stable and this was thought to likely stool w some old blood from prior bleed.
A repeat CBC was done and it was stable and so was pt's blood pressure.
Pt should have bp checked at rehab and if stable to high, after a few days, pt's home dose norvasc of 5mg QD can be restarted.
#FEN - Low salt, low fat diet #DVT pro - Ambulate frequently, pneumatic boots while in bed #Code status - DNR/DNI #Dispo - pt was weak and using cane/walker at home at baseline and after hospital stay, had more deconditioning.
We did a nuclear study that showed that bleeding is likely occuring in your small bowel.
The next step would have been to do an angiography and clot off the bleeding vessel but you were not sure if you wanted the procedure.
