TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial MDCT images were obtained through the brain without the administration of IV contrast.
Subsequently rapid axial imaging as performed through the brain after the administration of IV contrast.
CT HEAD: There is a hypodense region in the left occipital lobe which is unchanged from the prior CT and consistent with a subacute infarction.
[**2197-1-29**] CTA 1.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 50 year old man who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER from OSH when a head CT showed SAH.
CTA head was obtained which showed a 6mm basilar aneurysm.
His neuro exam was intact.
On [**1-18**], he underwent an angiogram with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] and a basilar aneurysm was confirmed and coiled without difficulty.
TCDs were performed which showed increased velocities in the distal basilar.
His exam remained intact.
His TCDs showed no spasm.
CTA was done and this did not show vasospasm or hydrocephalus.
On [**1-21**], CTA was done due to worsening headache on steroid and limited upgaze on exam.
IVF were increased to 150cc/hr, SBP goal was 180-200.
He continued to be pressed with SBP 180-200 with IVF 150cc.
This was started to stress his heart and the BP parameters were lowered.
Cardiac workup was intiated.
On [**1-27**] CTA showed diffuse vasospasm and he was transferred to the ICU for further care.
