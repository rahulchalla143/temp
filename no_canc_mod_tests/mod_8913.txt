In the ED on [**7-4**], the patient was noted to have EKG in ?
A CXR showed mild vascular congestion.
An echo was done on [**7-5**] showing LVEF < 20% (approx 10%; Left ventricular cavity dilation with severe global hypokinesis.
Prev study on [**2156-2-11**] showed LVEF 20-25%)  While on the [**Hospital1 1516**] service, the patient was initially given lasix boluses, and was later started on a Lasix drip on [**2156-7-5**].
Her Cr bumped to 1.3.
Pressures were notable for wedge of 20, RA pressure of 20, and CI 1.5.

Com;pared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-2-11**], the false tendon has ruptured and the left ventricular cavity is now larger.
Cardiac catheterization [**2156-7-7**] COMMENTS: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left filling pressures.
The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was elevated at 21 mmHg.
The cardiac index was notably depressed on 2L supplemental oxygen (with an assumed oxygen consumption) of 1.58  l/min/m2.
Cardiac perfusion study [**2156-7-7**] Final Report  RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:    10.1 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2156-7-7**]); HISTORY: 75 yo woman with a history of CAD with prior MI and CABG referred for evaluation of chest pain and worsening left ventricular systolic function.
Stress imaging was planned but unable to be performed.
METHOD:  Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
Given her persistent shortness of breath without other signs of heart failure, right heart catheterization was performed and the patient found to have elevated filling pressures.
Her CVP was generally between 11 and 17.
Her PA diastolic pressures correlated well with her pulmonary capillary wedge pressures and generally remained between 11 and 23.
Notably, her weight on admission to the CCU was 56.1kg (down from 58.3kg on [**2156-7-4**]) and her weight on discharge was 57.9 kg  Precipitants for this episode remain unclear but include the possibility of dietary indiscretion, new wall motion abnormality [**1-29**] another ischemic event, rapid atrial fibrillation (although pt well controlled in house), or worsening valvular disease (pt with with known MR).
Weight on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] ([**2156-5-5**]) was 57.7, ([**2156-6-23**]) was 58.3 kg, admit on [**2156-7-4**] was 56.1 kg.
The patient's INR on admission was 2.1.
On [**7-10**], her coumadin was restarted with a heparin bridge.
Her INR at the time of discharge is 1.3.
Because her INR was subtherapeutic we will discharge the patient on warfarin 7.5 mg daily with close follow up.
Cardiac perfusion study revealed a resting perfusion defect of the LAD territory.
We did a pelvic exam and there was no cervical motion tenderness but there was blood in the vaginal vault.
Began to develop after Cr normalized s/p easing of diuretic regimen.
Consider having a pelvic u/s and or endometrial biopsy in outpatient setting.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
