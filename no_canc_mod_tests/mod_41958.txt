An echocardiogram on [**2130-11-27**], showed an ejection fraction of 30 to 35% and multiple wall motion abnormalities which were new findings.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission to the floor revealed a temperature of 96.0, heart rate 64, blood pressure 110/60, oxygen saturation 95% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Jugular venous pressure is seven centimeters.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 13.9, hematocrit 37.8, platelet count 327,000, differential 76% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes.
Sodium 142, potassium 4.0, chloride 108, bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 43, creatinine 2.2, glucose 256.
Chest x-ray on [**2130-11-30**], showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates, improved from admission.
Echocardiogram on [**2130-11-27**], showed ejection fraction of 30 to 35%, regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities including an akinetic apex.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals, ST depressions in I and aVL, minimal ST elevations in V2 and V3, ST depressions in V5 and V6, no old electrocardiogram for comparison.
Congestive heart failure - The patient had bilateral interstitial infiltrates on examination which were read as bilateral pneumonia versus congestive heart failure.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2130-11-27**], which showed an ejection fraction of 30 to 35% and multiple wall motion abnormalities including apical akinesis.
After his renal failure resolved, he was transitioned to an ace inhibitor and his creatinine has been stable on low dose ace inhibitor.
Acute renal failure - Multifactorial - The patient had baseline renal insufficiency with a creatinine around 1.8.
His peak creatinine was 2.7 during this admission.
His CK was elevated to around 3000 with an unclear etiology with large blood on dipstick but no red blood cells on microscopy.
Acidosis - The patient has mixed gap and nongap acidosis.
Upon admission, his gap acidosis was due to his evolving peptic physiology at the time of his admission.
Psychiatric issues - The patient has history of mild dementia and agitation.
