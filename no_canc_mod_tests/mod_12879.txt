PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 98, blood pressure 137/100, respiratory rate 18, saturations 100 percent, heart rate 72.
HEENT - Pupils equal, round and reactive to light, 2 down to 1.5.
Lungs - Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His reflexes were 2 plus throughout and his toes were downgoing and visual fields were full.
He underwent an angiogram which showed a ruptured ACA aneurysm which he had coiled on [**2199-2-3**].
The patient was asymptomatic in terms of blood pressure problems.
The patient had a repeat head CT on [**2199-2-4**] which showed no new hemorrhage.
He had an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent, 1 plus AR and trivial MR.
The patient had a head CT on [**2-5**] that was stable or improved from [**2-4**].
On [**2199-2-8**] the patient had a repeat angiogram which showed a stable appearance of the aneurysm with moderate spasm in the right A1 segment.
The patient's blood pressure was kept in the 150-190 range and CVP 8-10 range.
The patient's ventricular drain was at 10 cm above the tragus.
On [**2-7**] the patient had a chest x-ray which showed mild to moderate volume overload and the patient spiked to 102.9.
He was continued cefazolin 1 gram IV q eight hours for ventricular drain prophylaxis and drain cultures showed 2 plus polys but no organisms from CSF sent on [**2-8**].
On [**2-6**] CSF showed 1 plus polys and no organisms.
Urinalysis was negative.
CSF cultures continued to be negative.
Blood cultures were pending.
The chest x-ray showed resolving perihilar edema and new bibasilar opacities and right small pleural effusion.
On [**2199-2-13**], the patient had a CTA which again showed vasospasm of the right A1 segment of the anterior circulation.
The patient's blood pressure continued to be kept in the 150-190 range.
The patient's temperature resolved and all cultures were negative to date.
The chest x-ray showed no consolidation and less atelectasis on [**2199-2-13**].
The patient had his ventricular drain changed to a lumbar drain on [**2199-2-13**] and the drain was clamped.
The patient had the lumbar drain removed after a head CT showed a stable size of the ventricles with the ventricular drain clamped for 24 hours.
On [**2199-2-20**] the patient had an LP and opening pressure was 22 and 30 cc of CSF was sent.
The patient had serial LP's done to assess for high opening pressures with the last being on [**2199-2-26**] with an opening pressure of 21 and closing pressure of 9.
