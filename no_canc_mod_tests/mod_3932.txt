COLI BACTEREMIA: She presented with SIRS criteria (leukocytosis w/bandemia, tachycardia, tachypnea), hypotensive requiring transient vasopressors peri-procedurally during the ERCP, and blood culture from the OSH grew pan-sensitive E.Coli.
While her urine culture also grew E.coli it was a different species, resistant to several antibiotics.
Surveillance blood cultures were negative.
TSH was WNL.
With fluid restriction to 1.5L her sodium slowly improved back towards baseline and was ..... at discharge.
CXR did not show signs of bleeding such as apical cap or sulcus sign.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -f/u final results of blood cultures -f/u with general surgery regarding elective cholecystectomy -f/u with ERCP for stent removal -check chem-7 in [**4-11**] days to follow sodium -if worsening abdominal pain or fever or inability to tolerate oral nutrition, please seek immediate medical evaluation as will need further labs and likely abdominal imaging  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
