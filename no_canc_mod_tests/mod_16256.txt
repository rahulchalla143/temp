KUB showed dilated loops of large bowel, maximal size about 13cm.
LUNGS: Exam limited by superimposed transmitted upper airway sounds.
Note: this physical exam was after colonoscopic decompression, prior to which she was very distended.

Since the previous tracing of [**2102-3-11**] further ST-T wave changes are present and the U waves appear more prominent.
ECG Study Date of [**2103-5-15**]  1:59:52 PM Probable sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay and marked left atrial abnormality but low amplitude atrial wave forms make assessment difficult.
ECG Study Date of [**2103-5-15**]  2:03:00 PM Probable sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay and left atrial abnormality but low amplitude atrial wave forms make assessment difficult.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2103-5-15**] 2:18 PM Single supine and semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained.
Bibasilar opacities are seen, new since the prior study, which may be due to infection and/or aspiration.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2103-5-15**] 2:19 PM Patient has chronically gaseous dilated loops of bowel measuring  up to 13 cm.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2103-5-16**] 10:33 AM Minimal interval increase in the degree of cecal dilatation  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2103-5-17**] 4:16 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased.
AP CHEST, 6:40 P.M. [**5-17**] AP chest compared to [**5-15**] and 12: Greater opacification at the base of the left lung is largely to moderate pleural effusion unchanged since 4:46 a.m.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2103-5-17**] 6:28 PM AP chest compared to [**5-15**] and 12:  Greater opacification at the base of the left lung is largely to moderate pleural effusion unchanged since 4:46 a.m.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2103-5-19**] 12:00 N Rotated positioning.
CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW, PORTABLE.
Upper zone redistribution, consistent with mild CHF.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2103-5-19**] 12:14 PM Rotated positioning.
Upper zone redistribution, consistent with mild CHF.
Abdominal xray upon admission suggested Ogilivie's, but could not rule out volvulus, and demonstrated worsening distention relative to previous studies.
She did have an occasional run of atrial fibrillation with heart rates reaching 140-150; these episodes resolved within minutes without intervention.
At that time, 10mg IV diltiazem was administered; sufficient nodal block was achieved, and patient's heart rate came down to the 80's.
#Acute oxygen desaturation:  Immediately following the episode described in the previous section, patient's oxygen saturations rapidly decreased to the low 80's.
Notably, when these secretions were suctioned during the episode of oxygen saturation, her saturations immediately improved to the 90's.
She had no further decline in oxygen saturation below 90%.
#Hypertension: On presentation, patient was found to have a blood pressure of 210/180.
Post decompression, patient's blood pressure has been well controlled on her home regimen of lisinopril and amlodipine.
She received half an ampoule of glucose(D50), with subsequent finger stick blood sugar measurements in the 80's-90's.
Her blood sugars were otherwise well-controlled on her home regimen of lantus with a humalog sliding scale.
