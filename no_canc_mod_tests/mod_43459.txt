The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-11-13**], the right ventricle may now be more dilated and hypokinetic (however views are suboptimal for comparison).
Exacerbating factors were potential medication non-compliance, worsening of pulmonary HTN (noted on TTE during this hospitalization), cigarette smoking.
Pressures remained well-controlled and it was not restarted at discharge; could be restarted as outpatient if blood pressures become difficult to control .
