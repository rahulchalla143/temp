During that admission she was ruled out for MI with serial enzymes.
Her peripheral edema was eventually attributed to renal dysfunction given >100 protein on U/A.
GI evaluated the patient and recommended EGD and colonoscopy but she refused to have done as an inpatient.
Hct was 30.7 (up from low 20s during her last admission).
Electrolytes normal with exception of glu of 209, BUN of 30 (cr 1.1), and elevated K 5.8 which improved to 4.9 with kayexalate, Cagluc, bicarb, and humalog.
CT abdomen (w/o contrast d/t reported allergy) showed no abnormalities with exception of known lung abnormalities seen on most recent admission, and were stable.
On ECG, ED concerned about [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in V5/V6 felt to be new and her first set cardiac enzymes were negative.
h/o CHF, ECHO [**2105-1-14**] w/o LVH or sys dysfunction (EF>55%) # s/p cholecystectomy # anemia - reportedly normal EGD and colonscopy in [**5-/2104**] at an outside hospital per patient report   Social History: Denies TObacco or ETOH Lives at home with husband.
CNs [**3-19**] grossly intact.
Pertinent Results: CT abdomen [**2105-3-11**]: no appy, diverticulitis, or bowel obstruction.
RUQ u/s [**3-11**]: Liver displays normal echogenic pattern and architecture without focal mass lesion identified.
L LE ultrasound [**2105-3-12**]: No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.
Renal US [**2105-3-16**]: Grossly normal renal ultrasound.
Endoscopy [**2105-3-18**]: Small amount of solid was found in the stomach body.
RUS [**2105-3-19**]: 1.
MRV [**2105-3-21**]: Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava below the IVC filter, extending into both common iliac veins.
IVC Gram [**2105-3-24**]: Large amount of thrombus in the IVC extending to the external iliac veins bilaterally.
During this procedure, the patient developed throat tightness and hypoxia after infusion of TPA through the AngioJet and dropped O2 saturations to the low 80s.
Echo [**2105-3-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-3-20**], no change.
CT ab/pelvis [**2105-3-26**]: 1.
CXR [**2105-3-27**]: CHF and underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be totally excluded.
Bilateral LENI [**2105-3-30**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

# RUQ abd pain/nausea: Pt had extensive workup, including noncontrast CT, abdominal ultrasound and labs which were nonconclusive.
Heart failure and liver disease were ruled out, as were amlodipine, thyroid abnormalities, hypoalbuminemia, and nephrotic syndrome.
Abdominal ultrasound showed patent renal and portal vasculature.
Pt then underwent MRI which confirmed large IVC filter clot extending to bilateral iliacs.
Pt underwent bilateral LENIs without visualization of femoral clots or revascularization.
Cr worsened with attempted diuresis, but did not appear to develop ATN per urine sediment examination.
At no point during pt's severe [**Doctor First Name **] sarca, did pt develop pulmonary edema or respiratory distress and thus sht was allowed to self regulate and slowly improved her blood pressure and then renal function.
Blood pressure eventually provided room for diuresis, which was done with daily Lasix 20mg IV.
Hypoxia - Pt's baseline oxygen saturation was mid 90s on room air.
Heme-onc was consulted and hypercoagulability workup was repeated while on heparin, but OFF warfarin.
As pt's filter has been in place for approximately 9 months, and is not possible to remove, she will likely need lifelong anticoagulation to prevent clot extension or reformation.
Her anemia studies showed normal MCV, elevated RDW with severe iron deficiency, and inappropriate retic count.
# Guaic positive stools: Pt was noted to have guaiac positive stools in setting of epistaxis, c diff, gastritis and iron repletion.
# CAD: Pt had had recent admission for workup of chest pain.
Pt had recurrent, almost nightly, chest pain, not thought to be cardiac in origin (repeated EKG unchanged, CEs neg).
Pt was continued on her statin, and BP meds restarted as blood pressure allowed.
# DM1: Pt's type 1 diabetes was monitored with QID finger sticks and treated with escalating doses of lantus and sliding scale to parallel her increasing PO intake.
To make a definite diagnosis of this, you should be seen by gastroenterology as an outpt and have a study called "gastric emptying study".
You were managed with blood thinners with gradual improvement of the edema.
This needs to be treated for 14 days with an antibiotic.
These were evaluated and cardiac causes were ruled out.
