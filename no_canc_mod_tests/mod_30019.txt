His last echocardiogram was in [**2192**] with an ejection fraction of approximately 20%.
Potassium 10 to 20 milliequivalents q day  HOSPITAL COURSE:  This patient was admitted on [**2197-1-24**] after having had a ventral hernia repair with panniculectomy and axillary liposuction done by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in cooperative with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the plastic surgical team.
The patient's interoperative course was thought to be uncomplicated, during which he received 1400 cc of crystalloid, had an estimated blood loss of 100 cc and made reportedly 640 cc of urine output.
The initial PA numbers for this patient were significant for 50/30 with a CVP of 14.
The patient's wedge was noted to be 25 with an output of 3.0 and an index of 1.2 and SVR of 1500.
This was with a blood pressure in the mid 130s and heart rate in the 80s.
His initial labs at that time were significant for hematocrit hemoconcentrated of 42 and a BUN and creatinine of 41/2.6 up already from a baseline of 1.5.
The renal service did an official consult noting that by the time of evaluation the patient was on dobutamine at 7.5 and Levophed at 0.2 mcg per kg per minute and had minimal urine output of approximately 20 cc.
The patient's creatinine by that first postoperative day had risen to 4.2 on its way to a peak of 4.5.
The renal assessment was that most likely the patient's preoperative usage of NSAIDS, indomethacin, in addition to the postoperative relative hypotension resulted in renal hypoperfusion and subsequent urinary suppression.
Oxygenation with his congestive heart failure was initially a significant challenge to the surgical house staff, but with Lasix the patient did maintain urine output and began to auto diurese somewhat.
Infectious disease consult was involved at this time and an abdominal CT scan was obtained which removed abdominal source from the differential.
The patient had some bilateral atelectasis on CT scan, but no free air, no abscess and no large soft tissue collection.
Eventually, one of the patient's BAL cultures grew out a multi resistant Enterobacter which the infectious disease people were not sure was colonized or not, but approved imipenem and blood cultures from [**4-9**] grew out Staphylococcus coagulase negative which were actually off of an A-line but this line was changed and the patient was started on vancomycin.
He had his BUN and creatinine which had normalized at 15 and 0.8 and was maintaining excellent urine output of between 2 and 3 liters a day.
