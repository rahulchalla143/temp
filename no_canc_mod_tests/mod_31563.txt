In the Emergency Room, a CT scan was performed which showed a small right frontal subdural hematoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.8, pulse 75, blood pressure 135/74, respirations 14, 100% on room air.
INITIAL LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.5, hematocrit 27.9, MCV 77, RDW 16, platelets 230,000.
The Chem-7 was remarkable for a potassium of 3.1.
The INR was 2.3.
The initial chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and mild vascular redistribution.
The EKG showed atrial fibrillation.
The head CT showed a right subdural hematoma, subacute.
There, in the MICU, the primary concern was lowering the patient's INR from the admission INR of 2.3 down to below 1.3 for her subdural hemorrhage.
She was originally given 4 units of FFP with eventual fall of her INR from 2.3 to 1.6.
The patient's blood pressure was stable throughout all times during the hospital course.
The patient received an echocardiogram on the day of discharge to fully evaluate her heart function which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-65% and a TR gradient of 25-30 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal.
The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells and had an appropriate increase in her hematocrit to 29.2.
Her hematocrit thereafter was stable and the patient was started on iron supplementation therapy.
The patient should have her electrolytes including potassium and creatinine checked every two to three days and have her electrolytes repleted appropriately.
