He was transferred to [**Location (un) **] for further evaluation on [**2147-6-6**].
On admission, vitals 110/60, 86, 20 100%RA.
The initial exam was notable for bibasilar crackles and severe bilateral LE edema with BNP of 2620 (unclear baseline), felt to be c/w CHF exacerbation, for which he was given IV lasix boluses.
His renal function deteriorated over the course of his hospitalization from admission creatinine of 2.5 (baseline 1.5-1.8) to 4.2 today.
Urine output reported to be 800cc in the past 24 hours.
Chest X-ray reported possible right base infiltrate with effusion so this was broadened to levaquin and ceftriaxone.
Liver function tests have worsened from AST/ALT of 179/64 on admission to 2600/1853 today.

Overall LV fx is severely impaired and estimated 20-25%.
Pulse doppler reveals increased E/A ratio w/ elevated E/E prime with grade III diastolic dysfunction.
pulmonary HTN with estimated pulmonary systolic of 50-60.
Overall LV function is severely impaired with EF of 20-25%.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, with pulmonary systolic 50mm to 60mm 4.
CARDIAC CATH:  6/ [**2146**] Cardiac cath ([**5-13**]): 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed native three vessel coronary artery disease.
Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated patent LIMA-D1 and SVG-OM grafts.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 16 mm Hg, PCWP mean 28 mm Hg).
The systemic arterial blood pressure was normal (SBP 122 mm  Hg).
The cardiac index was normal at 2.7 l/min/m2.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA comments).

#Acute on Chronic systolic Heart failure/Dyspnea: Patient was initally treated for HCAP at OSH but this was stopped given his CXR was without evidence of infiltrates.
An echo was done that showed dilated LA, RA, RV and LV; LV systolic function depressed with EF 20-25%.
Patient diuresed cautiously; sbp ranged from 70s-110s but mentating well.
His [**Last Name (un) **] and beta blocker were started slowly as blood pressure tolerated.
