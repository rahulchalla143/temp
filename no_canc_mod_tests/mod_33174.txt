CT Head without Contrast ([**2197-12-4**]): IMPRESSION: Left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
MRI Head with and without Contrast (): IMPRESSION: Unchanged left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with no enhancing masses or vascular malformation identified.
Cerebral Angiogram ([**2197-12-5**]): FINDINGS: Evaluation of the above branches demonstrates no evidence of aneurysms or vascular malformations.
IMPRESSION: Evaluation of the right internal carotid artery, right external carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, left external carotid artery, and left vertebral artery demonstrates no aneurysms or vascular malformations.
After a non-contrast CT of the head revealed a left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2197-12-3**] for further evaluation and care.
NEURO Following admission, an MRI of the head and neck was performed to better define the nature of the intraparenchymal lesion.
The study showed a stable left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with no enhancing masses or identifiable vascular malformation.
The imaging demonstrated no identifiable cause for the patient's hemorrhage (no aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation).
The sedimentation rate, CRP, RF, [**Doctor First Name **], and ANCA were normal or negative.
The patient's blood pressure continued to be quite elevated during the hospital course (170s-190s systolic).
At the time of discharge his blood pressure had been in the 130s systolic on norvasc, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide.
Allergies: PCN - anaphylaxis  Discharge Medications: 1.
An angiogram did not show a vascular cause for your bleed.
His office can be reached at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7394**] to schedule an appointment (Ideally after your MRI is performed as below).
Also, you will need a repeat MRI of your head and MRA head/neck in six weeks as follow up.
