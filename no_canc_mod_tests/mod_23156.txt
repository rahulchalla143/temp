Taken by EMS to OSH, where she was neurologically intact but CT scans revealed multiple cervical spine fractures.
L trans foraminal fx at C1, C3, C4, C6, C7, R transverse foraminal fractures at C1, C2,  R vertebral artery dissection on CT and MRI.

[**2148-12-25**] Head CT : 1.
[**2148-12-25**] CT C Spine : There is a linear lucency involving the right lateral mass of C2, best seen on series 4 image 29 likely representing a non-displaced fracture.
There is a fracture involving the C7 right transverse process best seen on series 4 image 73 involving the transverse foramina.
An MRI spine to further assess as clinically warranted.
[**2148-12-25**] CTA Head and Neck :   Segmental non-visualization of the right vertebral artery predominantly more proximally.
This is likely more due to atherosclerotic disease than trauma/dissection , but further evaluation can be obtained with gadolinium- enhanced MRA and fat- suppressed axial images of the neck if clinically indicated.

Due to multiple injuries including C spine she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
She was seen in the Emergency Room, outside scans were reviewed and her vital signs remained stable.
This proved to be [**Last Name **] problem, her oxygen saturations were stable and she was able to cough up her secretions.
Her hematocrit was also followed and she was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 21.
Subsequently she maintained a hematocrit in the 25-26 range.
She was briefly placed on heparin however at discharge she will be placed on aspirin and Plavix and will have a repeat CTA of the neck in 2 weeks.
Her blood sugars were out of control on admission requiring an insulin drip for the first 3 days however she was transitioned to part of her pre admission Levemir dose and this has gradually been adjusted to attempt to keep her sugars between 60 and 120.
Medications on Admission: Novalog SS Metformin 2grams qd Levamir 52U in AM 36 U qHS, Clonopin 1mg qhs Synthroid 88 mcg qd   Discharge Medications: 1.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
