Right heart cath showed RA=17, RV=59/18 mean 27, PA=48/25 mean 36, PCW=23 with a CO of 10.85 and an index of 5.25.
Coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with patent stents in the RCA; 30-40% proximal, 40% distal RCA lesions, 90% proximal LAD with TIMI 2 flow and no significant LMCA or LCX lesions.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared to the previous study of [**2165-12-12**], the right ventricular and inferior wall function has normalized while there are new anterior, septal and apical akinesis is new.
Cardiac Cath Report [**2170-10-31**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with LMCA that was free of angiographically significant disease.
Hemodynamic assessment showed elevated left and right sided filling pressures and preserved cardiac index.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old male with hx of previous MI in [**2165**] who presents with an acute anterior STEMI s/p successful PCI with cypher-DES to LAD.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Coronaries:  Cardiac cath showed 90% proximal LAD lesion which underwent succesful PCI to the LAD with cypher-DES resulting in 0% occlusion and TIMI III flow.
His peak CPK was 859.
His lipid profile showed an LDL of 177 and HDL of 54.
He maintained a HR in the 60's and BP in the 110's/60's.
(b) Pump:  The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram on the day following his myocardial infarction.
This revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40-45%, with anterior, septal and apical akinesis.
