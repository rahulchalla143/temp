The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for further management.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction times two; recent echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55%.
?, heart rate 71, blood pressure 100/60, respirations 44/min, oxygen saturation 80% on room air and subsequently 100% after intubation on the ventilator.
LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation CBC revealed a white count of 24.8, a hematocrit of 33.5, platelet count 417,000; CHEM7 revealed a sodium of 139, potassium 5.5, chloride 100, bicarb 25, BUN 45, creatinine 1.0, glucose 527; coag studies revealed PT 14.1, PTT 24, INR 1.3; urinalysis revealed large blood and nitrite positive, 22 red blood cells, 6 white blood cells, occasional bacteria; blood cultures were sent with 1 out of 2 bottles coming back positive for diphtheroids, this was presumed to be contaminant, although it would have been covered by subsequent antibiotic treatment; ABG revealed a pH of 7.53, pCO2 38, pO2 52.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm in the 80s with a normal axis, normal [**Doctor Last Name 1754**], normal intervals, U-wave, early transition, 0.
Chest x-ray revealed right lower lobe and left lower lobe infiltrates.
Other studies of note were a recent echocardiogram from [**2174-6-30**], which revealed an ejection fraction of 60%, 2+ mitral regurgitation noted, as was a small to moderately sized pericardial effusion, there were no echocardiographic signs of tamponade, there was no significant change from a prior echocardiogram of [**2174-6-27**].
Urine culture taken on admission later revealed growth of Proteus mirabilis.
Wound culture from the patient's decubitus ulcer grew out MRSA.
Sputum culture from [**2174-8-8**], grew out Proteus mirabilis and MRSA.
Stool studies from [**2174-8-8**], revealed positive Clostridium difficile.
Blood cultures from [**2174-8-8**], were negative for any growth.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be in respiratory distress (please above noted arterial blood gas), and the patient was also found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure running in the 60s.
The patient was intubated emergently and started on Dopamine after which her systolic blood pressure rose to the 90s and 100s.
The patient spiked a temperature to 103??????.
[**8-8**] through [**8-9**], the patient's systolic blood pressure dipped again down into the 70s, and thus she was restarted on pressors.
A hematocrit drop over the previous several days from 33.5 to 27.8 to 25.9 prompted a transfusion of 2 U of packed red blood cells with an appropriately elevated hematocrit thereafter.
The patient also spiked a temperature to 101??????.
Sputum grew out Proteus mirabilis and MRSA.
[**8-11**] through [**8-12**], the patient had a brief episode of hypotension with systolic blood pressure running in the 80s.
On [**8-14**], the patient had an oxygen saturation of 99% on shovel mask and was subsequently transferred to the Medicine floor.
During the patient's course on the Medical floor, she remained afebrile, and her white count remained in the normal range.
