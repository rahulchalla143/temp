HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old female with multiple medical problems and a complicated medical history who presented to an outside hospital status post myocardial infarction for cardiac catheterization.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission revealed a complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 9.9, her hematocrit was 30.4, and her platelets were 167,000.
Her prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and INR were normal.
Her sodium was 136, potassium was 4.4, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 24, blood urea nitrogen was 92, creatinine was 2.3, and her blood glucose was 146.
Her creatine kinase was 217.
Her CK/MB was 8.
Her troponin was 0.35.
Her calcium was 9.3, her phosphorous was 4.8, and her magnesium was 1.8.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with severe pulmonary edema.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2148-9-7**] (at 1410), the patient developed flash pulmonary edema with hypertension and a blood gas of 7.2/40/63.
A chest x-ray at that time showed cardiomegaly with blunting of the right costophrenic angle with peripheral vascular redistribution and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.
Her troponin level was 4.2.
Her creatine kinase was 219.
Her CK/MB was 9.3.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which demonstrated severe 3-vessel disease.
The resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated left-sided and right-sided filling pressures with a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 15, a pulmonary wedge pressure of 15, and the right atrial mean pressure was 10, and the central aortic pressures were normal.
At the time of the patient's admission and cardiac evaluation, Vascular Surgery was consulted regarding the patient's left leg cellulitis.
Ultimate recommendations were that she would require an angiography to determine the extent of her peripheral vascular disease.
Her post myocardial infarction course was complicated by recurrent pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure requiring afterload reduction and diuretics for improvement, diminished renal output secondary to hypoperfusion and microvascular disease, with a peak creatinine of 2.4, and difficulty with swallowing which was evaluated by a Speech and Swallow evaluation.
On [**9-24**], after Mucomyst and intravenous hydration protocol, an arteriogram which demonstrated abdominal aorta with moderate diffuse disease.
The graft was patent, but the distal anastomosis showed 99% stenosis with reconstitution of the popliteal with distal occlusion at the AK.
A chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
She required multiple adjustments in her antihypertensive medications and beta blockers to maintain a systolic blood pressure in the 120s to 150s.
On [**10-13**], she did require one unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26.
The graft pulse was palpable.
Labetalol 300 mg by mouth twice per day (hold for systolic blood pressure of less than 110 or a heart rate of less than 60).
Mitral regurgitation of 3+ and aortic insufficiency of 2+.
