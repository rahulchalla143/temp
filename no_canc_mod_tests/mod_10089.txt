CXR [**2-19**]:  Slight worsening of congestive heart failure.
Transthoracic echo [**2-19**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2164-12-25**], left ventricular systolic fuction is more depressed (septal dysnchrony more apparent) The severity of aortic stenosis amd mitral regurgitation are similar.
CXR [**2-20**]:  1) No interval change in position of Swan-Ganz catheter tip.
EKG [**2-21**]:  Uncertain supraventricular tachycardia which could be non-paroxysmal junctional tachycardia versus other paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia mechanism.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2165-2-19**] which showed sinus tachycardia at about the same rate, supraventricular tachy-arrhythmia is new.
CXR [**2-25**]:  Overall improvement in degree of congestive heart failure, but there is a worsening area of opacity in the left lower lobe.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2165-2-27**]):    NO GROWTH.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2165-2-28**]):       YEAST.
SPUTUM GRAM STAIN (Final [**2165-2-27**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2165-3-1**]):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
Despite this, her condition worsened, with inability to maintain adequate blood pressure or urine output, fungemia, and ultimately, death.
After a few days of milrinone she unfortunately developed an atrial tachycardia that was not controlled despite lopressor, which dropped her blood pressure.
In [**Last Name (un) **] to accomodate this change, her natrecor was discontinued to preserve her blood pressure.
Her urine output slowly fell, however, and it was difficult to diurese her any further which such severely reduced renal perfusion.
4) ID: There was question of pneumonia on CXR during the hospitalization, however the patient was saturating well, and on levo/flagyl, and there were other etiologies to explain her white count elevation.
Blood cultures at this time grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and she was started on caspofungin.
