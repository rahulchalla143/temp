at [**Hospital1 1474**]: HCT 37.4, Cr 1.9 .
micro - U/A c mod blood and trace protein .
ekg - NSR at 70, axis -30, nl intervals, no ST change .
CT Chest: IMPRESSION:  1.
ENT was consulted and visualized his upper airway which revealed mild arytenoid edema thought not to be the cause of stridor.
CT neck was obtained which showed severe tracheal stenosis and interventional pulmonology was then consulted.
A rigid bronchoscopy was performed that revealed mild tracheomalacia and granulation tissue in the upper trachea was cleaned out.
He will also need to follow up with IP 4 weeks from discharge for repeat evaluation and CT scan and flexible bronch.
Subsequent imaging reveals shoulder in place.
He was evaluated by neurosurgery here and V-P shunt appears to be functioning properly w/o e/o of worsening hydrocephalus on CT head (CT also negative for bleed).
Narcotics and other sedating medications were avoided and his mental status began to clear following extubation and wean from sedation.
Aspiration pneumonia:  Was febrile with elevated WBC count on admission.
He was started on Levo/flagyl and fever and white count resolved.
Iron studies revealed normal iron, elevated ferritin and low TIBC c/w ACD, but does not account for the acute drop during his stay at [**Hospital1 18**].
His hct has stabilized in the high 20s since.
# Nephrotic syndrome:  Urine protein:creatinine ratio revealed 0.2.
# CRI:  Basline creatinine from PCP records reveals creatinine of 1.5-1.7.
# Hyperglycemia:  Throughout his stay, he had borderline blood sugars which became  markedly elevated while on steroids (for stridor) into the 180s.
He was encouraged to drink free fluid to evaluate whether his sodium would correct with PO free water alone.
He was evaluated at the bedside by speech and swallow and then had a video swallowing studying performed; both of which cleared him for PO intake.
