CAD: He has a history of severe 3vd, s/p CABG with recent catheterization showing patent grafts with totally occluded native vessels.
His enzymes were elevated on admission and remained stable.
He declined Swan evaluation to determine CO/CI and pulmonary pressures (recent SWAN at [**Hospital3 **] showing PCWP =30, PA 50/36 with mean of 42, RV 50/25 with RA 25).
He was symptomatically improved at time of discharge, and chest X-ray showed improvement in his failure.
His pacer was reprogrammed to fire in response to a higher rate (136).
When he reverted to sinus rhythm in the 50's, his blood pressure improved.
Pt declined Swan, and his blood pressure improved when his tachycardia resolved.
ARF/CRF: Creatinine was between 1.4-1.8 during hospitalization.
He was instructed to have his creatinine and potassium checked within 3-4 days of discharge.
Leukocytosis: likely was a reaction to ischemia, but cultures were checked to rule out infectious etiologies.
All cultures were negative (urine, blood, sputum), and chest X-ray was without signs of infiltrate or focal process.
Serial CXR's were checked to rule out hemothorax given arterial stick when subclavian line was attempted.
He had EGD/colonoscopy in [**Month (only) 956**] that were basically within normal limits (reports were obtained; colonoscopy showing polyps and diverticulosis).
He required 1 U PRBC while in-house for a hct of 26.9.
Hemolysis labs were checked and were negative.
Upon discharge, he was instructed to follow up with his PCP/gastroenterologist to ensure that hematocrit remained stable.
Your hematocrit should be followed to ensure that your blood counts are stable.
