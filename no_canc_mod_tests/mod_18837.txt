MICRO: Stool Cx ([**2153-9-7**]): no C. diff Peritoneal fluid Cx ([**2153-9-6**]: no growth Urine Cx ([**2153-9-5**]): no growth .
Portable CXR ([**2153-9-3**]): 1) New large left pleural effusion and left basilar opacity, could reflect infection with parapneumonic effusion and/or compressive atelectasis.
[**9-11**] CT TORSO: 1.
This diffuse lymphadenopathy has increased since the comparison CT from [**2153-2-5**], and is concerning for progression of the known lymphomatous process.
Occlusion of the IVC between the confluence of the iliac veins and the left renal vein, likely secondary to extrinsic compression by the periaortic collection of enlarged lymph nodes.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
As per his urine studies, this was likely secondary to his cirrhosis-related intravascular volume depletion.
# Renal Failure: Admission creatinine was 1.3, however creat began to rise while on tolvaptan and later while being fluid restricted.
Urine studies were suggestive of a prerenal etiology, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
Urine output gradually decreased and the pt became less alert, likely due to uremia, therefore HD was initiated on [**8-7**].
# Pneumonia: The pt's WBC increased on [**9-3**] and a CXR was suggestive of pneumonia.
EKG is w/o evidence of right heart strain to suggest PE.
# Nausea: Pt has had chronic nausea, likely multifactorial: hyponatremia, medications, uremia, ascites, and infection (an EGD revealed candidal esophagitis) as potential causes.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was tranferred to the SICU and the transplant surgery service for further hemodynamic montitoring for possible sepsis, where he was maintained eventually on triple pressors and then made CMO once it was determined that further escalation of care would be outside of his wishes.
ECHO on [**9-18**] showed EF>55% and only small pericardial effusion.
Pulm: CXR on [**9-3**] was consistent with a large left pleural effusion.
The patient had another thoracentesis in which 2.5 L were removed.
He remained intubated with a PS of 5 and PEEP of 8.
The patient had a paracentesis on [**9-10**] in which 2L fluid was removed.
Liver ultrasound showed no abnormalities.
CT TORSO on [**9-11**] was consistent with worsening adenopathy throughout the abdomen, most heavily concentrated in the periaortic region, which is concerning for PTLD.
Cortisol stimulation showed no adrenal insuffiency.
Infectious disease: The patient has blood cultures on SICU admission.
The patient had a peritoneal tap, which had 300 WBCs and a negative culture, thus ruling out SBP.
His PICC was removed, and a LIJ was placed.
Culture for the PICC was negative.
Blood, urine, pleural fluid, and abdominal fluid cultures remained negative.
