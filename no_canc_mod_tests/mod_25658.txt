CXR [**2141-5-20**]: FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and is accompanied by new pulmonary vascular engorgement and moderate pulmonary edema as well as new small pleural effusions.
Patchy opacities at the lung bases probably reflect dependent areas of pulmonary edema  [**2141-5-22**] 07:15AM BLOOD WBC-8.1 RBC-3.85* Hgb-13.5* Hct-38.1* MCV-99* MCH-35.0* MCHC-35.3* RDW-13.1 Plt Ct-275 [**2141-5-22**] 07:15AM BLOOD Plt Ct-275 [**2141-5-22**] 07:15AM BLOOD PT-13.8* PTT-24.6 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2141-5-22**] 07:15AM BLOOD Glucose-112* UreaN-17 Creat-1.3* Na-138 K-3.9 Cl-104 HCO3-25 AnGap-13 [**2141-5-22**] 07:15AM BLOOD Albumin-3.4* Calcium-8.8 Phos-2.7 Mg-2.0 [**2141-5-22**] 07:15AM BLOOD Phenyto-8.3* [**2141-5-20**] 01:25AM URINE Blood-SM  Nitrite-NEG Protein-TR Glucose-NEG Ketone-NEG Bilirub-NEG Urobiln-2* pH-5.5 Leuks-MOD [**2141-5-20**] 11:00PM URINE Blood-NEG Nitrite-NEG Protein-NEG Glucose-TR Ketone-NEG Bilirub-NEG Urobiln-NEG pH-6.5 Leuks-NEG  Brief Hospital Course: 82M admitted with R IPH, question of a underlying vascular anomaly.
