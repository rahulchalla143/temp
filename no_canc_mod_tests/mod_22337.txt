A hemoglobin A1C was 7.1%.
The Apgar scores were 7 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the neonatal intensive care unit a weight of 3250 grams (90th percentile), head circumference of 34 cm (greater than the 90th percentile), length of 47 cm (50th to 75th percentile).

A cardiac echocardiogram    was performed on [**2153-1-15**] showing no patent ductus    arteriosus and a small patent foramen ovale with a    structurally normal heart.
With the onset of    Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, a cardiac echocardiogram    was repeated and showed an intracardiac clot propagating    from a hepatic vein into the right atrium.
A cardiac    echocardiogram repeated on [**2153-1-29**] showed that    the clot had resolved.
[**Known lastname **] has had    normal heart rates and blood pressures.
A recent blood    pressure was 90/42 with a mean of 56.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: [**Known lastname **] was initially    nothing by mouth and treated with intravenous fluids.
Her discharge weight is 4205 grams, length is 52 cm, head circumference is 37.25 cm.
On day of life 7, due to    lethargy, a blood culture was obtained and subsequently    grew Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to oxacillin.
Four    subsequent blood cultures were obtained and were positive.
HEMATOLOGY: [**Known lastname **] underwent a double volume exchange    transfusion shortly after birth for a total bilirubin of    10.8/direct of 0.4 around 1 hour of age.
Since the exchange transfusion,    she has received 2 packed red blood cell transfusions due    to anemia; the first one on [**2153-1-25**] (day of life    10) for a hematocrit of 28% and again on [**2153-2-19**]    (day of life 42) for a hematocrit of 22%.
Her most recent    hematocrit was 38% on [**2153-2-22**].
Peak serum bilirubin after double volume exchange    transfusion on day of life 3 was a total of 15.6/direct of    0.5 mg/dL.
Her rebound bilirubin off phototherapy was a total    of 1.9 mg %.
RENAL: Renal and abdominal ultrasound was performed    looking for a possible clot or focus for the    Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.
NEUROLOGY: [**Known lastname **] had a head ultrasound on the day of    discharge ([**2153-2-28**]) which showed cysts in the    anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricles.
State newborn screens were sent on [**2153-1-12**] and    [**2153-1-23**] and are within normal range with the    exception of the hemoglobinopathies, the AT was out of    range.
A follow-up newborn screen has not been done.
Prematurity at 34 and 3/7 weeks gestation.
