Admission Date:  [**2190-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-10-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-7-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Paxil / Benadryl / Buspar / Levaquin / Adhesive Tape  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Pericardial effusion s/p SVT ablation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: electrophysiology study with incomplete ablation   History of Present Illness: 66-year-old lady with history of breast and bladder cancers was admitted for elective EPS with ablation for SVT.
However, on the day of her most recent cystoscopy on [**3-5**] at [**Hospital1 69**], she experienced a tachycardia, which was terminated after she received intravenous Lopressor.
During the procedure she developed hypotension to SBP of 77 mm HG.
This responded to IVF and dopamine infusion to SBP of 130s.
PA catheterization showed preserved CO, no equalization of filling pressures, and preserved Y descent on RA tracing.

There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-10-8**], the pericardial effusion appears similar in size.
HEMODYNAMICS: RAP 20, PCWP 17, Arterial oxygen 98%, RV oxygen sat 71% .
Atypical Induced orthodromic AVRT, CL 400 msec via left lateral BT.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2190-10-9**]: 1.
Recommend echocardiogram 3.
Left lobe hepatic cyst; could consider outpatient ultrasound for further characterization.
(Cardiac output was preserved and there was no equalization of filling pressures.)
Arterial line was also placed for blood pressure monitoring.
Patient was initially hypotensive, but her blood pressure was responsive to IV fluid hydration and dopamine.
Her blood pressure remained stable over the next 24 hours, and a repeat TTE on [**10-9**] did not show worsening of the pericardial effusion.
In EP lab, monitors showed left lateral ventricular pre-excitation, retrograde VA block via BT at 350 msec,   anterograde BT block at 300 msec, and atypical induced orthodromic AVRT, CL 400 msec via left lateral BT.
Rhythm was monitored on telemetry and showed predominantly sinus rhythm.
In the cath lab, heparin was reversed with protamine, post cath checks were unremarkable, and a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis was negative for a retroperitoneal bleed.
Hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable throughout hospital stay.
