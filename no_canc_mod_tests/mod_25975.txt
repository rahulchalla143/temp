Pertinent Results: [**2190-7-3**] CT/CTA Brain CT HEAD: There is a right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen adjacent to the falx with surrounding edema.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD: The CT angiography of the head demonstrates a 3.7 x 2.5 mm aneurysm arising from the bifurcation of the anterior cerebral artery A2 segment.
CT head demonstrates intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal region and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with developing hydrocephalus.
[**2190-7-3**] CXR FINDINGS: Single portable chest radiograph was obtained.
[**2190-7-3**]  CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM WITH COILING OF ANEURYSM Final Report DATE OF SERVICE: [**2190-7-3**].
Left vertebral artery arteriogram shows the left vertebral artery to be hypoplastic predominantly supplying the left PICA.
Right vertebral artery arteriogram shows filling of the right vertebral artery and the basilar artery.
Right internal carotid artery arteriogram shows that the anterior and middle cerebral artery fills well.
IMPRESSION: EU critical [**Doctor First Name 7279**] underwent cerebral angiography and coil Embolization of a distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysm leaving a small residual at the neck.
An external ventricular drain enters the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and the tip terminates appropriately in the third ventricle.
CT Head [**2190-7-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2190-7-6**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-5**], the tip of the Dobbhoff tube is now in the body of the stomach.
CT/CTA/CTP Head [**2190-7-7**]: CT PERFUSION: There is an abnormally prolonged transit time at the site of the right intraparenchymal hematoma but no other areas of prolonged transit time to suggest infarct.
EEG [**2190-7-7**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of nearly continuous bifrontal electrographic seizures throughout the recording.
EEG [**2190-7-7**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of nearly continuous bifrontal electrographic seizures throughout the recording.
EEG [**2190-7-8**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent bifrontal electrographic seizures which appeared to originate from the left frontal region and then spread to bilateral frontal regions.
Compared to the prior day;s recording, electrographic seizures occupy less of the recording but still account for about 50% of the record.
CTA [**2190-7-12**]: FINDINGS: CT HEAD: There is a large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, largely unchanged from prior study.
CT PERFUSION: There is increased transit time in the right frontal lobe, inferior to the hematoma and above the orbit with decreased blood flow and low blood volume, representing ischemia with completed infarction.
LENIS [**2190-7-12**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins.
EEG [**2190-7-9**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent bifrontal electrographic seizures which appeared to originate from the left frontal region and then spread to bilateral frontal regions.
Compared to the prior day's recording, electrographic seizures are much less frequent.
EEG [**2190-7-10**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent brief bifrontal electrographic seizures which appeared to originate from the left frontal region and then spread to bilateral frontal regions.
Compared to the prior day's recording, electrographic seizures are much less frequent and background activity is slower and more disorganized.
EEG [**2190-7-11**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent bifrontal (L>R) epileptiform discharges occasionally in semi-periodic runs.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there were no electrographic seizures but background activity is slower and more disorganized.
EEG [**2190-7-12**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of nearly continuous bilateral frontally predominant polymorphic delta wave forms which did not seem to become rhythmic.
Compared to prior day's recording, these findings suggest an improvement given the reduction in seizure frequency.
EEG [**2190-7-13**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of nearly continuous bilateral frontally predominant polymorphic  delta waveforms which did not seem to become rhythmic or semi-rhythmic.
Compared to prior day's recording, there were no electrographic seizures.
EEG [**2190-7-16**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of diffuse background slowing and frequent runs of bilateral frontally predominant polymorphic delta activity.
Compared to prior day's recording, background activity was slightly improved, but there is still prominent bifrontal slowing and epileptiform activity.
EEG [**2190-7-17**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of diffuse background slowing and frequent runs of bilateral frontally predominant polymorphic delta activity.
Compared to prior day's recording, background activity was slightly improved, but there is still prominent bifrontal slowing and epileptiform activity.
EEG [**2190-7-18**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study due to nearly continuous predominantly bifrontal more independent polymorphic non-rhythmic delta waveforms more prominent on the right.
EEG [**2190-7-19**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal 5 hours and 45 minutes extended routine EEG study due to runs of sharp and slow wave discharges seen bifrontally and independently in both hemispheres indicating a tendency for focal onset seizures.
CT Brain [**2190-7-20**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Brain [**2190-7-23**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
She underwent a cerebral angiogram with coiling of a Right ACA aneurysm.
Her exam improved after the EVD placement and a she was able to be extubated on [**2190-7-4**].
A CT Head was performed which also remained stable.
On [**7-5**], Transcranial dopplers were done which were normal.
Her exam remained stable.
On [**7-6**], early morning she was less responsive and a CT head was performed which was stable.
Her exam improved later that morning.
She also has some desaturation and her CXR showed some bibasilar atelectasis.
A CTA head was performed which showed no vasospasm.
Her neuro checks had been Q 1hr for days, we changed it to Q 2hrs to help promote sleep.
An EEG was ordered and still pending.
Her EVD output remained 10-20 cc/hr.
Her SBP was kept 95-220 without difficulty.
In the evening, it was noted that her EVD slowed and no longer drained, her ICPs were in the mid 20's and she was hypertensive.
On [**7-8**], her EEG showed left frontal discharges which was concerning for seizures.
A load of Dilantin was given and Dilantin 100mg TID was started.
Her Keppra was then increased to [**2178**] mg [**Hospital1 **].
On [**7-9**] Her exam remained unchanged and we continued to monitor her progress with transcranial dopplers which were negative for vasospasm.
Her oxygenation had decreased on Friday eve and a CXR was performed which appeared stable, she was given Lasix 10mg x1.
On [**7-10**], her EEG showed seizures and she was bolused with Dilantin.
On [**7-11**], there was no further seizures on EEG but generally slower.
On [**7-12**], CTA revealed mild vasospasm and we opted to press her.
She did improve exam wise with this on [**7-13**].
On [**7-14**], her blood pressures have been labile and required two agents and a couple of boluses of albumin.
Cardiac enzymes and a Cortisol level were obtained which were normal.
Evaluation of her CTA revealed no evidence of vasospasm and she was taken off pressors on [**7-14**].
EEG monitoring revealed sub-clinical seizures on the 27 th and 28th, she was bolused several times with dilantin and her dilantin level was increased on [**7-16**] to 300 [**Hospital1 **].
She also underwent a clamping trial and failed on the 29th.
CT was negative for hydrocephalus.
The pt pulled out her NGT and was bright enough for bedside trial of oral intake, but will need a PEG placed on this hospitalization as her PO intake is not adequate to sustain her nutritional needs.
