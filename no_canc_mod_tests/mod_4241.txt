A liver biopsy in [**2196-2-1**] revealed the presence of grade 2 inflammation and Stage II-III fibrosis.
On admission, she was found to be in acute liver failure with AST of 2,158, ALT 948, total bilirubin 6.0, and alkaline phosphatase of 142.
She was additionally found to have pancreatitis with amylase in the 400's and lipase in the 300's.
Her amylase and lipase also improved with treatment.
The patient's peak INR was 4.6 on [**4-2**] and her peak PTT was 80 on [**4-16**].
A MRCP was performed to evaluate for additional causes of pancreatitis and/or obstructive biliary disease.
This study was negative for obstruction of the bile ducts, but did show evidence of acute liver inflammation as well as portal hypertension.
She was placed on lactulose with an appropriate increase in stool output and resolution of her confusion and asterixis.
Cellulitis:  The patient received an ultrasound evaluation of the left lower extremity for her pain, erythema, and swelling on [**2200-4-3**].
This study revealed an area of tracking subcutaneous edema, but no deep vein thrombosis.
The ENT service was consulted and after an evaluation with laryngoscopy, they recommended administration of a proton-pump inhibitor for potential laryngeal reflux.
Swabs for viral culture were obtained and at time of transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**], had not revealed the presence of a viral infection.
A biopsy revealed changes consistent with bullous impetigo.
A CD4 count was drawn on [**4-2**] and returned at 574.
Hepatitis C diagnosed in [**2194**] and treated with ribavirin and PEG-interferon.
Mupirocin cream 2% one application [**Hospital1 **].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT TIME OF TRANSFER:  Temperature 98.0, heart rate 78-112, blood pressure 101-120/60-76, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
In's/out's:  1,[**Telephone/Fax (1) 22653**].
Weight 75.1 kg.
Skin:  Bandage over biopsy site on upper back, generalized jaundice throughout.
Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds at the right base, few crackles bilaterally, otherwise clear to auscultation and without egophony.
Extremities:  No cyanosis; 3+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally, left calf with a bright red area, warm and tender to palpation (28 x 10 cm in extent).
LABORATORIES AT TIME OF TRANSFER:  White blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 32.5, platelets 44.
INR 2.5, PTT 50.9.
Sodium 136, potassium 3.0, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25, BUN 12, creatinine 1.1, glucose 122, calcium 8.6, magnesium 1.5, phosphorus 4.1.
ALT 31, AST 58, alkaline phosphatase 149, amylase 217, total bilirubin 10.7, albumin 2.1.
Respiratory culture pending, throat culture for beta Streptococcus and GC pending.
Throat culture from [**4-5**] with 2+ budding yeast, Clostridium difficile toxin assay negative x3, CMV-DNA not available, HSV antigen negative, VZV antigen negative, CMV IgM negative, EBV IgM negative, viral culture negative for adenovirus, enterovirus, herpes simplex virus, RSV, influenza, parainfluenza.
Bacterial wound culture with gram-positive cocci in pairs, coagulase negative Staph sparse.
Blood cultures negative x3.
Abdominal ultrasound revealing patent hepatic vasculature, appropriate flow directionality, small fluid around and in the left lower quadrant, edematous gallbladder.
She was consistently negative in her fluid balance and her anasarca improved.
Likewise, her PTT's were consistently elevated in the 40's and 50's.
By time of discharge, liver function tests had trended down to following levels:  ALT 16, AST 42, alkaline phosphatase 130, and total bilirubin 7.1; direct fraction 3.4.
The vomited fluid was clear with blood clots.
She received an EGD on [**4-17**], which revealed a single oozing 5 mm ulcer in the lower third of the esophagus, normal stomach, and normal duodenum.
A colonoscopy performed on [**4-17**] revealed nonbleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, and otherwise normal colonoscopy exam to the cecum.
An esophageal swab from the ulcer was tested for HSV-I and II.
They recommended continuing the Unasyn and obtaining a MRI of the left lower extremity to evaluate for presence of osteomyelitis.
The MRI revealed a large fluid collection tracking down into the calf, potentially representing a ruptured [**Known lastname 4675**] cyst versus an independent infectious process.
An inhibitor screen was sent, and was pending at time of discharge.
The patient was scheduled to followup in Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic for further evaluation of her coagulopathy.
