He was found to have negative direct and indirect Coombs test with a low haptoglobin and negative cold agglutinins.
Ultrasound showed large amounts of ascites with a left pleural effusion.
MRI showed normal liver, no mass in the pancreas or ductal dilatation.
Taps of his ascites revealed an SAAG of 2.4 indicating portal hypertension with 400 white blood cells, 5444 red blood cells, 43% polys, 12% lymphocytes and 31% monocytes.
MRA of the abdomen was negative.
Echocardiogram revealed normal RV function.
Hepatitis serologies were done indicating a previous hepatitis B infection, but not chronic.
Endoscopy at that time showed a grade 1 varix, at which time the patient was started on propanolol.
Transjugular biopsy of the liver was done at that time which was a very small specimen leading to a non diagnostic study although some periportal fibrosis was seen.
He had some dry heaves, but did not actually vomit, did not have any diarrhea and had a temperature to 102??????
His chest x-ray was clear at the time.
Bone marrow biopsy was repeated, as was a liver biopsy.
All other studies there, including right upper quadrant ultrasound and ERCP were normal.
On admission there, the patient's total bilirubin was 3, rising to 8 before transfer.
His transaminases were in the 100s going up to the 200s at the time of his transfer.
Amylase and lipase were normal.
The bone marrow biopsy from the outside hospital showed that it was normocellular with all lines present, had ill formed granulomas and mild lymphocytosis.
There was 1+ to 2+/4 on the iron stain with no increase in ringed sideroblasts.
Echocardiogram done on admission also showed normal RV function.
Hepatitis B 3.
Prostatitis 7.
?, blood pressure 130/70, heart rate 83, respiratory rate 20, 97% on room air.
Fingerstick showed a glucose of 164.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Sublingual icterus as well as scleral icterus bilaterally.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient's Unasyn was discontinued and Solu-Medrol was changed to prednisone 60 mg.  An attempt was made to retrieve the biopsy specimens, including liver and bone marrow from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital to be reviewed by staff pathologists at [**Hospital6 2018**].
Endoscopy showed a grade 1 varix in the esophagus which was not bleeding at the time and the patient was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit, was re-scoped on the 12th again showing the same findings with the addition of a polypoid mass in the stomach which again was not bleeding.
He was transfused again with 1 unit and his blood pressure was monitored very carefully.
His aldactone and beta blockers were held for blood pressure support.
Endoscopy again on the 16th was performed due to increased encephalopathy.
Both the bone marrow and liver biopsies were consistent with granulomatous disease.
Hepatitis serologies were repeated.
Hepatitis B surface antibody was positive.
Hepatitis B surface antigen was negative.
Hepatitis E antibody was nonreactive and hepatitis E antigen was nonreactive.
Hepatitis C antibody was negative.
Haptoglobin was 30.
LABS THROUGHOUT HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's total bilirubin on the day of admission was 36.1 which peaked at a [**Location (un) **] of 41.9; it was 33.7 prior to discharge.
ALT and AST were in the 230s at admission which peaked in the 400s and 500s respectively and were now down to the 200s at the time of discharge.
Alkaline phosphatase was 310 on admission, peaked at 416 and is now down to the 300s again.
White blood cell count was 9.7 on admission and rose to 16.7 with no obvious source of infection.
It was thought that the rise in white blood cell count was due to the chronic steroid treatment.
The patient's hematocrit was 42 on admission and with the recurrent bleeds, fell as low as 31.
Platelets were 97 on admission and remained in the 80s throughout the hospital course.
A serum ACE level was checked which was returned at 327 with the normal range being 9 to 67.
The most recent biopsy of the liver revealed ill formed granulomas which are noted to be adjacent to the portal areas.
It was 2+ to 3+ periportal and intralobular inflammation noted consisting of lymphocytes and rare plasma cells, polymorphs and rare eosinophils.
Acid fast stain was negative for AFB.
The patient's PT and INR remained normal throughout the admission.
Chest x-ray was negative.
A central line had been placed for his transfusion which was also used for TPN.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient's blood pressure remained stable after being transfused with the aldactone and beta blockers being held.
