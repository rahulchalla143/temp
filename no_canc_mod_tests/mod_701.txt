Colonoscopy in [**2179-2-13**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs, temperature 97.0, heart rate 80, and blood pressure 135/75.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Skin exam shows 2-3 mm papules over neck, back, and chest.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission, white blood count was 5.4 with 86 neutrophils, 11 bands, and 1 plasma cell.
Hematocrit was 40.1 and platelets are 246.  chemistry, sodium 141, potassium 4.3, chloride 105, bicarb 26, bun 8, creatinine 0.7, and glucose 109.
ALT is 150, AST 90, alkaline phosphatase 58, LDH 328, total bilirubin is 1.1, lipase 20, and amylase 63.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed prominence of small bowel with mild thickening and a very few short segments.
That night the patient did develop the transaminitis with ALT to 674 and AST 754 with an LDH of 861, and total bilirubin 1.6, pt 13.1, PTT 29.2, and INR of 1.1.
Hep serologies were checked in addition to CMV, EBV, and an acute HIV infection.
Dermatology acutely saw the patient on the night of [**2180-4-17**], and noted a micropapular blenching rash, which was thought to be a viral exanthem.
TSA was performed showing evidence of varicella zoster virus.
A smear was reviewed and showed no evidence of cystocytes and hypertension was elevated.
However, the patient began to require increasing levels of oxygen.
The patient's O2 saturation was approximately 90 percent on a 10 liter V-stent.
In addition, the patient was noted to be tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s.
ALT increased to 35.73, AST increased 53.23, alkaline phosphatase just 180, and total bilirubin increased to 5.8.
Platelets declined to 23, haptoglobin was less than 20, and fibrinogen was 94.
However, DFA for VZV became positive and IgG for VZV was negative consistent with primary varicella infection.
The patient's chest films and pao2 to fio2 ratio were consistent with ARDS.
ABG at that time was 7.14, 38, and 86.
Regarding his acute renal failure, the patient's bun and creatinine continued to rise despite fluids.
Prior to this time, the patient had been ruled in an esophageal balloon study to help determine adequate peak.
Further imaging was performed in order to understand etiology of liver failure.
Ultrasound showed clots in the portal vein, decreased splenic vein flow, patent hepatic veins, and IVC.
The patient is currently on three pressors, and blood pressure was responsive to volume resuscitation as well as bicarbonate, but there is lot significant concern for volume overload and pulmonary edema.
Approximately, 15-20 minutes prior to the patient's death, heart rate was in the 170s naps were in 50s and began to decrease.
Again patient's NAPS and heart rate continued to drop.
Volume resuscitation was begun without improvement in heart rate or bp.
