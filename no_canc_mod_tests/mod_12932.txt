Hepatitis A antibody positive, but hepatitis B and C negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:  Temperature is 97.2, blood pressure 100/57, pulse of 51, respiratory rate of 16, and 97% on room air.
Pulmonary is clear to auscultation except for the bases which have decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
LABORATORIES UPON ADMISSION:  White count 13.3, hematocrit 29.6 with MCV of 102, platelets 55.
Sodium 125, potassium 5.3, chloride 95, bicarb 23, BUN 63, creatinine 1.5, glucose 147, calcium 8.7, phosphate 4.9, magnesium 2.9, INR 2.1, PTT 46.6, PT 17.7, ALT 84, AST 70, LDH 172.
Alkaline phosphatase 158, amylase 28, total bilirubin 24.8.
The fluid was sent for cell count and Gram stain.
The fluid came back showing 55 white blood cells with 12% neutrophils, 7% lymphocytes, and 26% monocytes, and 125 red cells.
The Gram stain of the fluid was negative for any organism.
The MRI of the abdomen that was done for liver workup showed large abdominal ascites, so a second paracentesis at bedside was attempted.
The second paracentesis required about [**4-19**] re-entries before it was deemed that no further fluid could be obtained.
Gram stain was also negative on the second paracentesis.
A MRI of the abdomen was obtained showing a cirrhotic liver with a volume of 1479 cc.
A subsequent abdominal ultrasound revealed that there was no right accessory hepatic vein.
Also done was a transesophageal echocardiogram for transplant workup showing left atrial dilation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
An ejection fraction was greater than 55%.
Despite lactulose administration, the patient continued to be less oriented, so a CT scan of the head was obtained showing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
A KUB and upright chest x-ray was done showing no free air.
However, the plain films did show a lot of gaseous distention of his [**Last Name (LF) 7809**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was started on a Fleet enema and simethicone to help relieve the gaseous distention from the lactulose use.
The patient came in with an INR of 2.1 upon admission.
He was continued on his vitamin K supplements each day, but his INR seemed to worsen from 2.1 to 2.6.
Hyponatremia:  The patient came in with the sodium of 125.
He was put on 1.5 liter fluid restriction and his sodium did resolve coming back up to 140.
Acute renal failure from acute tubular necrosis likely to prerenal azotemia:  The patient's creatinine was 1.5 upon admission, and did improve to 1.2 with administration of albumin and normal saline.
However, his creatinine started worsening, so he was started on octreotide and midodrine.
Though this did help his creatinine improve temporarily, his creatinine then slowly crept up to 2.4.
Though suggested that the patient may need to go to the Intensive Care Unit for a Swan placement, so that he could be loaded with fluids, the Hepatology service felt that the patient should be observed on the increases of octreotide and midodrine.
Since his hematocrit did remain stable around 30, it was felt that he did not need any endoscopy at this time.
His hematocrit was checked twice a day, and remained stable around 30.
After the MRI showed large abdominal ascites, a second paracentesis was performed with re-entry of the needle to 4-5x.
A CT scan of the abdomen was obtained showing a sense of straining at the right flank and right lower quadrant consistent with a cellulitis.
He was then treated empirically with Vancomycin while his blood cultures on [**2200-5-31**] grew 4/4 bottles with gram-positive cocci.
A VRE rectal screen was obtained and shown to be positive.
However, Infectious Disease was consulted and felt that the antibiotic regimen should not be changed and that Vancomycin should still be the antibiotic choice given that the blood cultures did not grow any VRE.
Surveillance blood cultures were obtained on [**4-14**], [**6-5**], and [**6-8**].
The [**6-2**] blood cultures were negative, and the rest of the blood cultures is nothing growth to date.
A repeat CT scan of the abdomen was obtained showing fat stranding at the right flank with no worsening cellulitis.
When his white count climbed up to 16, beside being on the appropriate Vancomycin for his MRSA bacteremia, a chest x-ray was obtained on [**6-8**] showing low lung volumes, left upper lobe/lingula loss of translucency consistent with aspiration, and an increased retrocardiac opacity that may be consistent with atelectasis versus consolidation.
At this time, patient was started on Levaquin and Flagyl to cover his aspiration pneumonia, and his white count did drop down to 12.5 from 16.
A urine culture was also obtained to exclude the aspiration pneumonia, may not be the cause and urine culture was found to be negative.
A Speech and Swallow consult was obtained, and a subsequent video swallow study showed that he aspirated a small amount of thin liquids, and a huge amount of regurgitant feeding tube feeds.
