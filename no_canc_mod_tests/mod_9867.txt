At the OSH, initial troponin I was 0.65 with a CK of 86.
An ECG showed questinoable ST-elevations in V2-V3.
During the procedure he continued to have back pain and an aortogram was performed showing no dissection.

ECG [**2134-1-5**]: Sinus rhythm.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2134-1-5**]: 1.
Echocardiogram [**2134-1-5**]: There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiogram [**2134-1-5**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
ECG [**2134-1-6**]: Sinus rhythm Lateral T wave abnormalities are nonspecific but cannot exclude ischemia Since previous tracing of [**2134-1-5**], no significant change .
ECG [**2134-1-7**]: Baseline artifact Sinus rhythm; Anterolateral T wave abnormalities are nonspecific but cannot exclude ischemia ; Since previous tracing of [**2134-1-6**], further precordial lead T wave abnormalities now present  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
His cardiac enzymes peaked that evening with a CK of 378, CKMB of 29, MBI of 7.7 and a troponin of 0.97 and then trended down.
An aortogram was done to assess for an aortic dissection and was negative for dissection.
He had an emergent echo to assess for pericardial tamponade which was negative.
The was weaned off the night of admission and his chest and back pain resolved.
He should have a repeat cardiac catheterization in 2 months for a relook and the cardiac cath lab here will contact him for this.
He had an aortogram to assess for aortic dissection.
He had an echo to assess for pericardial disease.
PUMP FUNCTION An echocardiogram was obtained to assess his heart function.
His EF was 50% and the echo showed mid to distal anterior hypokinesis of the left ventricle.
He was monitored on telemetry.
Urology saw the patient on [**2134-1-6**] and recommended irrigation and further workup as an outpatient if the hematuria persisted.
On [**2134-1-8**], the patient's urine was less red but still a cranberry color.
Mr. [**Known lastname 12412**] was discharged with follow-up with cardiology, a repeat catheterization in 2 months, and urology follow-up.

You underwent a cardiac catheterization and a blockage was opened.
You will be called by the cardiology office here for a cardiac catheterization in 2 months.
You will require a repeat catheterization in 2 months to evaluate your main left artery stent, and will be contact[**Name (NI) **] to set up that procedure.
