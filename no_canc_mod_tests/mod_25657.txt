[**2122-7-4**] 07:28AM URINE Blood-MOD Nitrite-NEG Protein-30 Glucose-NEG Ketone-NEG Bilirub-LG Urobiln-2* pH-5.5 Leuks-MOD .
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images were obtained.
[**2122-7-8**] CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast: TECHNIQUE: Multiple MDCT axial images were obtained from the base of the neck through the proximal thighs after the uneventful administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenously.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The visualized thyroid enhances homogeneously.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver is significantly enlarged.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Surgical drain is seen entering the left lower abdominal wall and coursing into the contralateral side to the anterior surface of the liver.
COMPARISON: Abdominal radiographs from [**2122-6-30**].
Abdomen/pelvis CT from [**2122-7-8**].
Several air-fluid levels are seen on the decubitus radiograph.
[**2122-7-13**] Renal US: TECHNIQUE: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color ultrasound images of both kidneys were obtained.
COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**2122-7-8**] and abdominal ultrasound from [**2122-7-6**].
FINDINGS: The right kidney is known to be atrophic from a previous CT and is not demonstrated on this ultrasound examination.
Labs at discharge:  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the surgery service for evaluation and treatment.
He was taking to the OR on HD 2 for exploratory laparotomy and  evacuation of the hematoma.
CV:  The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
The patient's intake and output were closely monitored as his JP drain output was greater than 2 liters with ascitic fluid, and at POD 9 it started to slow down to less than one liter and the drain was pulled on POD 13.
The patient's electrolytes were routinely followed during this hospitalization, and repleted when necessary.
As creatinine value was increasing, renal consult was called and in concert with the hepatology service the patient was managed for hepatorenal syndrome with the addition of IV albumin, octreotide and midodrine.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
WBC trended up in spite of antibiotics with count 53.3 on [**2122-7-11**].
Blood cultures have been sent throughout the hospitalization, and have always returned as no growth.
C diff was sent x 3 and c diff PCR were all negative.
CT scan done on [**7-8**] did not reveal any fluid collections or areas concerning for infection.
There was one positive peritoneal fluid for VRE on [**7-10**], however the organism count was scant.
Hematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required during this stay following the initial admission transfusions.
Social work and palliative care met with the patient and his family, and hospice was arranged.
