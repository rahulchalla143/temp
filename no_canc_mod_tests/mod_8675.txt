RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2101-3-26**] 10:03 AM  Reason: r/o evolving stroke and make sure there is no new hemorrhage  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 46 year old man with h/o SAH's, stroke REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o evolving stroke and make sure there is no new hemorrhage CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been further evolution of large right MCA stroke with a well-defined hypoattenuating area indicating edema and progressive encephalomalacia.
Air-fluid level and aerosolized secretions within the left maxillary sinus and left frontal sinus as well as opacification of the mastoid air cells were seen on the prior exam and likely relate to the patient's previous intubated status.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 1 iv injection of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline at rest.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic and cephalic veins were performed.
Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 46 year old man with recent SAH now w/ R MCA stroke REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please perform CT PERFUSION study in addition to CTA.
Center perfusion study on frontal horns of lateral ventricles (4 above, 4 below).
INDICATION: 46-year-old male patient, with recent subarachnoid hemorrhage, now with right MCA stroke, to perform CT perfusion.
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT head, followed by CT angiogram of the head and neck and CT cerebral perfusion study was performed with IV contrast.
COMPARISON: CT of the head done on [**2101-3-22**], CT of the head done on [**2101-3-13**].
FINDINGS:  NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD:  As seen on the most recent noncontrast CT, there is a large hypodense area in the right cerebral hemisphere in the MCA territory, representing acute infarction.
There is no significant change, compared to the scan done a few hours earlier.
However, this appearance is new, compared to the CT head done on [**2101-3-17**].
CT PERFUSION:  There is increased mean transit time, corresponding to the area of hypodensity in the right cerebral hemisphere with decreased blood flow and slightly decreased blood volume, compared to the left cerebral hemisphere, with no mismatch between the areas of decreased blood flow and blood volume, and hence, representing acute infarction.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD AND NECK:  The origins of the arch vessels are patent.
Limited evaluation of the anterior and the middle cerebral arteries till the M2 segments.
However, the basilar artery is diminutive in caliber with no significant change, compared to the prior CT done on [**2101-3-13**].
Multiple lymph nodes are noted in both sides of the neck, the largest in the right level 1B, measuring 1.0 cm, and not enlarged by CT size criteria.
Interval development of large right MCA territory acute infarction, as seen on non-contrast and CT Perfusion studies, compared to the study done on [**2101-3-17**].
Limited evaluation of the supraclinoid segments, anterior and middle cerebral arteries due to artifacts from the aneurysm clips/coils.
