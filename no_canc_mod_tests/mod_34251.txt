In the ED, initial vs were: T 101 P 146 BP 105/64 R 18 O2 sat 94% RA.
She was given 6L NS IV and had 3L urine output in ED.
Pertinent Results: [**2142-10-2**] knee X ray: In comparison with the study of [**8-29**], there has been placement of a total knee prosthesis without evidence of hardware-related complication.
[**2142-10-2**] chest x ray pa / lat: No acute intrathoracic process.
[**2142-10-3**] transthoracic echocardiogram: Suboptimal study due to patient decision not to allow for study completion.
If clinically indicated, a follow-up transthoracic study with color Doppler and apical images and/or a TEE is suggested to better assess the possible posterior mitral leaflet abnormality  [**2142-10-3**] transthoracic echocardiogram:  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-10-3**], the previously noted mobile echodensity on the posterior mitral leaflet is no longer seen .
Mild mitral regurgitation is now seen (not previously assessed).If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE would be better able to define the mitral valve morphology and severity of mitral regurgitation.
