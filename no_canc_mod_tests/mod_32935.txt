He was noted to be hypotensive at the time in the 60s (usual SBP is 90s), his Hct was 27.8 (his prior Hct baseline is 27) and he was given IVF and transfused 2 units.
He received an upper endoscopy although it is unclear if this was performed during his hospitalization course or whether it was done a week prior.
The upper endoscopy showed no gastric or esophageal varicies but did show bleeding of the antrum as well as some of the gastric body which was thought to be from gastric antral portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Following an appropriate reposnse in his Hct from 27->32 pt was discharged with GI recommendation of PPI therapy, follow up with his GI doctor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 86**] and periodic transfusions.
His upper endoscopy on [**2101-7-10**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for screening purposes during a hospitalization for abdominal pain.

Hematocrit was followed closely and noted to return to baseline (he had been s/p 2 units PRBCs at OSH) and then noted to be stable.
Nadolol was discontinued on day 6 of admission due to heart rate in the low 60's so as to not mask tachycardia in setting of possible bleed.
Hematocrit continued to be stable.
Abdominal ultrasound on admission showed cirrhotic liver, moderate-to-large ascites and patent hepatic vasculature.
Diagnostic paracentesis on hospital day 3 was negative for SBP.
On day 9 of admission, paracentesis was repeated which was positive for SBP with neutrophil count of ~1700 when corrected for blood from traumatic introduction of needle.
Paracentesis was positive for SBP (~1700 neutrophils) and patient was started on Ceftriaxone.
After less than 24 hours of treatment with Ceftriaxone, white blood cell count continued to increase and patient looked clinically worse on exam with increased somnelance and diaphoresis.
Antibiotic coverage was changed to Cefepime and Vancomycin (Vancomycin added due to finding on CXR in LLL).
Patient showed imrpovement with change of antibiotics with resulting decrease in white blood cell count.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis (without contrast [**1-10**] ARF) showed no acute process.
Repeat paracentesis showed increased neutrophils in ascitic fluid and antibiotic coverage was changed to meropenem.
He had a repeat diagnostic paracentesis in the MICU on [**2101-9-3**], which was again positive for SBP despite coverage with vanco/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/cipro/flagyl.
Acute Renal Failure - Patient admitted with creatinine of 1.8, elevated from baseline ~1.4 on previous admission.
Renal function continued to worsen over 4-5 days.
Urine electrolytes showed Na > 10, not consistent with HRS.
Noted to have chronic portal hypertensive gastropathy requiring multiple admissions and blood products.
At family's request, patient was to be referred to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location 14660**] for evaluation for possible CABG-liver transplant upon discharge.
No intervention for previous positive stress-MIBI was done during this admission.
Summary per ICU Team  ICU Course: Vitals were monitored closely and noted to be stable until [**8-29**] when Mr. [**Known lastname 60517**] had an acute event marked by hypoxia with subsequent transfer to the ICU.
CXR revealed a substantial right lung white out suggestive of aspiration PNA vs. chemical pneumonitis.
An UGI scope was performed demonstrating oozing gastropathy and liver recommended reversing INR with FFP.
ECG was performed showing ST depressions in the lateral leads accompanied by cardiac enzyme elevation.
Echo was performed which showed wall motion abnormalities in the corresponding territory suggesting significant myocardial ischemia; however, given comorbid illness and active GIB, patient was not candidate for intervention or anti-coagulation.
On [**9-7**], after extensive conversations with family, the decision was made for CMO care.
