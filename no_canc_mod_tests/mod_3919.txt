A CT of the head showed cortical atrophy, old lacunar infarcts bilaterally in the basal ganglia, small vessel disease, some asymmetry of the periventricular white matter to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right frontal lobe.
She was started on a course of prophylactic antibiotics for recent testing which came back negative for C-diff which she has completed.
She was found to be in atrial fibrillation and was admitted to the ICU, was started on amiodarone and converted to SR. She continued to have chest discomfort and subsequently underwent a stress test that revealed an inferior defect with inferior infarct.
Troponins were drawn (beginning [**2172-5-23**] 3.07, 3.47, 2.68, 3.53, 4.07) and patient ruled in for NSTEMI.
An echo done on [**2172-5-23**] showed an EF of 50-55%.
She was transferred for further evaluation and for a cardiac catheterization.

Cardiac catheterization revealed significant coronary artery disease and surgery was consulted.
She underwent preoperative workup including echocardiogram and carotid ultrasounds.
She was started on betablockers for heart rate and lasix for diuresis.
She was also in and out of atrial fibrillation at a rapid rate and was started on Amiodorone and had her beta blocker increased.
