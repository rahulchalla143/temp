URINE CULTURE PENDING AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE.
CXR was unremarkable, but he was initially covered empirically for HCAP with cefepime and vancomycin.
LENIs were negative for persistent DVT.
Although he has a listed allergy to penicillins (rash), his daughter [**Name (NI) **], his HCP, states that he has tolerated keflex previously.
INR on the day of discharge is 1.5.
Arrangements were made for close surveillance of his INR given the concomittant use of anitbiotics (particularly doxycycline): he will have his INR check on [**3-30**] by VNA and on [**3-/2061**] at his PCP's office.
He is guiaic negative and his Hct is trending up.
The patient declined a video swallow and his diet was down-graded to ground solids with thickened liquids.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on Monday [**3-30**] and fax to the office of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  at fax ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 39173**], tel ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 6846**].
A CXR did not demonstrate pneumonia.
You will have your INR checked on Monday by the VNA and faxed to your PCPs office.
You should hold lisinopril as we have not given it to you in the hospital and your blood pressure has been within a reasonable range.
