LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior - hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; apex - hypo; remaining LV segments contract normally.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Overall LV systolic function improved - EF now 45-50% but septal, anterosepatal, and anterior mild hypokinesis remain.
After ER evaluation paient referred for cath which revealed LAD and RCA dz, he was then referred to CT surgery.
