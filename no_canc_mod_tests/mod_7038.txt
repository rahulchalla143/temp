A CT scan of the head there demonstrated a small right frontal intracranial hemorrhage and possibly an epidural hematoma.
A Dilantin load was given and he was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further treatment.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission, the patient had a temperature of 97, heart rate 70, blood pressure 220/104, respiratory rate 21 and oxygen saturation 95% in room air.
Fingerstick was 124.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Right side of face with periorbital zygoma in chin with swelling and ecchymosis, superficial abrasion, sutured laceration around 2.5 cm along the right brow, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, anicteric sclerae, tympanic membranes clear without hemotympanum, moist mucous membranes, no oral lesions noted.
Chest: Slightly decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 9.5 with 87 neutrophils 1 band and 3 lymphocytes, hematocrit 31.2, platelet count 183,000, sodium 141, potassium 4.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate 25, BUN 16, creatinine 1.4, glucose 181, lithium level 0.5, prothrombin time 11.3, INR 0.8, partial thromboplastin time 24.3, CK 27, no MB, no troponin.
CT scan of the head at outside hospital:  Small right frontal area with high intensity, representing blood; unclear whether this is an intraparenchymal or epidural hematoma secondary to atrophy of the brain.
Cervical spine:  Negative for fracture, normal alignment, degenerative joint disease throughout.
They recommended that he be loaded with Dilantin and then start oral Dilantin 100 mg three times a day, and repeat CT scan in 24 hours.
A repeat CT scan demonstrated interval decrease in the size of previously described extra-axial hemorrhage with possible intra-axial component along the anterior aspect of the right frontal lobe, no new areas of hemorrhage were identified.
The patient's blood pressure throughout his hospital was well controlled with continuation of his nadolol and the addition of hydralazine as needed.
