She underwent an irrigation and debridement of her hand for treatment of this abscess versus cellulitis.
Her hematocrit on the day of transfer was noted to drop from 31 to 25.
Endoscopy that was performed showed a duodenal ulcer with a fresh blood clot.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation and treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is significant for coronary artery disease, including a cardiac catheterization in [**2171-9-23**] that showed moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction and 1 vessel coronary artery disease and an ejection fraction of 63%.
A pericardial window in [**2164**] and a hysterectomy in [**2171**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature of 97.4, heart rate of 82, blood pressure 133/50, respiratory rate of 20 and a saturation of 97% on 2 liters.
Her cardiovascular exam had a holosystolic murmur of [**3-28**].
LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent initial laboratory included an initial sodium of 135, potassium 4.6, chloride 104, bicarbonate 19, BUN 93, creatinine 3.0.
Blood glucose is 78.
An initial CBC significant for a white blood cell count of 20.7, hematocrit 38.6 and a platelet count of 108,000.
The patient's LFTs were an ALT of 15, an AST of 78 and alkaline phosphatase of 77.
Amylase 113, T-bilirubin 0.6, and a lipase of 152.
The patient's first blood gas on [**5-6**] had a pH of 7.2, an O2 of 81, a CO2 of 41, bicarbonate 17 and a base excess with negative 11.
Problems by systems, briefly in terms of cardiovascular, the patient had an echo that showed an ejection fraction of 65%.
In addition, because of her complicated hemodynamic status, she initially required monitoring with a Swan Ganz catheter, which was ultimately changed to a triple lumen catheter on hospital day 6.
Her urine output was often dependent upon the presence of Levophed.
However, her blood pressures remained intermittently low.
However, she developed a right lower lung opacity and a pneumonia, as well as a pleural effusion and became obtunded.
From a GI perspective the patient was given high doses of IV Protonix for her duodenal ulcer.
Her creatinine on admission as stated previously was 3.0 and ultimately trended down to 1.0.
It was believed that thus her renal failure was secondary to hyperperfusion as a renal ultrasound on admission was within normal limits.
