GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
An epiaortic scan was conducted to deliniate areas of least plaque/calcifcation for aortic cross clamp and cannula prior to bypass.
A torn mitral chord is present, originating from the posteromedial papillary muscle.
Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen, most prominent when blood pressure is in 170's systolic.
LVEF >55%.
Peak MR remains [**12-7**]+.
Remaining exam is unchanged.
