Patient reports he was sleeping the night prior to admission when the pain awoke him from sleep, described as a chest heaviness as if an animal was sitting on his chest accompanied by nausea and vomiting.
At the [**Hospital1 **] emergency department patient was found to be bradycardic to the 40s with a blood pressure in the 90s to 110s, O2 saturation 97 percent.
On the day of admission patient underwent cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 1444**] and was found to have the following hemodynamics:  right atrial pressure mean of 9, right ventricular pressure of 27/11, pulmonary artery pressure 26/16, wedge of 16.
Left sided catheterization showed LAD with mild segmental disease, left circumflex nondominant, no critical lesions, RCA which is dominant showed distal 99 percent occlusion which was stented.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 97.8, blood pressure 108/54, heart rate in the 70s, O2 maturation 93 to 100 percent on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination: jugular venous pulses difficult to assess as patient is lying down and unable to sit up due to recent catheterization.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES FROM ADMISSION:  Sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 110, bicarbonate 23, BUN 16, creatinine 0.7, glucose 108.
White blood count 13.3, hematocrit 39.4, platelets 261, INR 1.2, PTT 47.1.
Alk phos 40, AST 178, total bilirubin is 0.5, ALT 46.
Calcium 7.8, phos 3.1, magnesium 1.6.
CK 1864 with an MB of 167, MBI of 9, troponin greater than 50.
Electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in 2,3 and AVF with ST depression in V1 through V3, bradycardia in the 40s.
Patient underwent an echocardiogram on [**11-12**] the results of which are pending at this time.
Echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion, EF 50-55% with inferior-posterior akinesis.
Signal Averaged ECG was performed and was positive, however the patient's risk of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias was felt to be fairly low given his minimally depressed LV systolic function.
2) Heme:  He was initially started on Reopro which was continued for 18 hours post catheterization with no significant bleeding.
However, there was no bruit and distal pulses were intact.
