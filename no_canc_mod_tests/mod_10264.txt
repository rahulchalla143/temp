Cardiac evaluation yielded three vessel disease and AS, status post AVR/CABG in [**6-19**].
Admitted last month after 1 wk of CP--> stress test showed large reversible defect.
He was then admitted for cath which showed diffuse disease with patent LIMA and occluded SVG-PDA.
His first cardiac cath of the aforementioned yielded: PCWP 12, PA 28/12, RV 27/7, RA 6, CO 5.5, PVR 116.
Since that admission, the patient had ongoingdyspnea and has been worked up for dyspnea by CT scans x2 at NEBH which showed pleural plaques and LLL mass vs. rounded atelectasis.

Occult cardiac ischemia was not evident via serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs.
Contribution from diastolic HF in the setting of aflutter may have also contributed in small part to the presentation.
This is the likely diagnosis when taken in concert with his 2 Chest CT scans that did NOT show parenchymal changes consistent with interstitial disease.
Bronchodilator challenge showed FVC improvement though not diagnostic of asthma as this study was done on 10mg of Prednisone.
At discharge he was able to ambulate down the hallways with Oxygen saturation > 90% on room air.
Additional pulmonary studies such as ANCA, IgE levels for ABPA, glactomannans, sputum Cx were non-diagnostic.
Urgent CT scan yielded retroperitoneal bleed (report above) that was felt to be spontaneous.
A flutter rate was controlled with oral CCB.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is aware of the findings and is following serial CT scans as outpatient.
