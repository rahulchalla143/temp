HISTORY:  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 63430**] is a 3545 gram product of a term gestation sent to the newborn intensive care unit for evaluation of sepsis risk manifested by postnatal fever.
Apgar scores were 9 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes of age.
The infant did well in the nursery until the morning of [**6-2**], when the infant was noted to have a temperature of 101.2.
His weight loss at that time was [**8-2**] percent.
Oxygen saturations were in the low 90s in room air.
Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat were normal.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
[**Doctor Last Name **] blood pressure has been stable throughout his    hospitalization.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION.
His weight at time of discharge was 3405    grams.
Electrolytes upon admission to the newborn    intensive care unit showed a sodium of 146, potassium 4.8,    chloride 106 and bicarbonate of 21.
A bilirubin was drawn on day of life 4,    with a total bili of 4.8 and a direct bili of 0.4.
[**Doctor Last Name **] hematocrit upon admission to the    newborn intensive care unit was 58.9, with a platelet    count of 118.
His platelet count dropped over the course    of the next 48 hours, with a low of 52,000 on [**6-3**].
His    platelet count subsequently has risen, with a platelet    count of 67 on day of life 5 and a platelet count of 80 on    day of life 6, then finally a platelet count of 115 on day    of life 7.
Coagulation studies    were measured on day of life 5, with a PT of 17.3 and a    PTT of 29, a fibrinogen of 336, and elevated d-dimers of    6631.
Upon admission to the newborn    intensive care unit, a CBC with differential and blood    cultures were drawn.
The CBC showed a white count of 5.3,    hematocrit of 58.9, platelet count 118, with 60 percent polys    and 3 percent bands.
Lumbar puncture was performed, with CSF analysis    without pleocytosis.
Repeat CBC on day of life 4 showed a    white count of 10.7, hematocrit of 58.1, platelet count of 73,    with 48 percent polys and 1 percent bands.
CSF HSV PCR was    sent shortly after admission to the NICU and was found to    be negative on day of life 7.
Blood cultures sent upon    admission to the NICU also were negative.
Enteroviral    surface cultures and CSF PCR were sent, and these are pending    at the time of discharge.
Secondary to the thrombocytopenia,    two urine samples were sent for CMV culture; these are    negative at the time of discharge.
Neurologic examination remained within normal    limits throughout hospitalization.
CSF analysis was benign.
A hearing screen was performed with automated    auditory brainstem responses.
Ophthalmology - Eye exam not indicated for this full    term infant.
PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of [**Hospital 1411**] Pediatrics, phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 63431**].
Car seat position screening not indicated.
Followup platelet count is recommended at that time.
