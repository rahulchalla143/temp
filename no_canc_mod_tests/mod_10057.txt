Today, given the increasing oxygen requirement he went to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5871**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where he was noted to have a leukocytosis (WBC 19.9 with 87%PMNs) and lactate 2.6.
CXR showed right-sided pneumonia.
Labs notable for WBC 19.2 (90% PMN) with normal lactate.
Initial ABG was 6.9/113/101/24 on 100% FiO2.
His subsequent ABG were 7.26/34/275/16 on 100% FiO2, and then 7.18/47/128/18.
A repeat CXR confirmed likely right-sided pneumonia.
He was febrile to 101.2 and most recent VS prior to transfer are: 98, 117/83, 98% on Fi02 100%, PEEP 5, RR 20, TV 350.

SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..  [**2182-2-23**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING EMERGENCY [**Hospital1 **]  [**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-8-24**], the current study is of superior image quality, but remains suboptimal and suggests multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2182-2-23**] 2:23 AM IMPRESSION: Bibasilar consolidations, likely atelectasis and pleural effusions but cannot exclude infectious process.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2182-2-24**] 1:54 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-23**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, more prominent on the right.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2182-2-24**] 11:42 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little overall change.
LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2182-2-25**] 8:54 AM IMPRESSION: Right PICC terminates in the right atrium and should be withdrawn 4-5 cm for better positioning.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2182-2-26**] 2:15 AM Tracheostomy tube is seen in standard position.
Transitional issues: f/u blood culture from [**2182-2-23**] ECHO results: pt is already on a beta blocker, can consider increasing.
His last bronchial cultures were cipro and meropenem-resistant.
As such, the patient was maintained on vancomycin and aztreonam and he was suctioned and bronchial washing and sputum cultures were sent.A PICC line was placed for IV access but this was removed on day of discharge.
His cultures grew only low levels of [**Hospital1 **].
ID was consulted and felt his cultures showed pseudomonal colonization and not true infection.
His ABG normalized during HOD 2.
Patient was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital stay.
During his hospitalization he also had a cardiac ECHO performed, which showed left ventricular cavity dilation with regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
These findings were similar to his last ECHO in [**2179**].
His EF was 30%.
On day of discharge his vital signs were also stable.
Transitional issues: f/u blood culture from [**2182-2-23**] ECHO results: pt is already on a beta blocker, can consider increasing.

Your sputum grew low levels of [**Hospital1 **] (a type of bacteria).
You also had an ECHO of your heart performed which showed that your heart pumping function is mildly decreased.
