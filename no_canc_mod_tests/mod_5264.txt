On the day of admission, her INR was found to be 4.1.
Initially when the patient presented, her hematocrit was 35.5 and as noted, her INR was 4.1.
The patient was admitted and started on gastrointestinal bleed protocol and started on intravenous Protonix, given fresh frozen plasma to reverse her anticoagulation and had plans to follow her coagulation studies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Notably on her admission examination, temperature was 98.8, heart rate 124, blood pressure 150/80, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 99% in room air.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine service and underwent an endoscopy by Gastroenterology which showed some blood which could have been secondary to an ulcer or at staple line.
The patient had serial hematocrit levels followed as noted previously.
Her next hematocrit after the initial one drawn dropped to 27.6.
The patient remained on the Internal Medicine service but was subsequently transferred over to surgery where her conservative management continued with proton pump inhibitors, intravenous fluids, and serial hematocrit checks.
She no longer had any episodes of bleed and her hematocrit stabilized between 26.0 and 27.0.
She underwent placement of a temporary inferior vena cava filter which was without complications for her history of deep vein thrombosis and as the patient could no longer be anticoagulated.
Again, as noted, the patient was transferred to the surgery service where conservative management with keeping her NPO and following serial hematocrit checks continued.
Her hematocrit was stable and last recorded at 27.9.
Her coagulation studies had returned to within normal limits.
