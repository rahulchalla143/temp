PA and lateral chest radiographs are recommended for better visualization of this abnormality.
Chest CT [**8-6**]: 1.
Recommend 3-4 weeks of antibiotic treatment and follow up with chest x-ray to assess any change in size of this nodule and possible biopsy or PET scan at that stage if the mass remains unchanged.
Slight increase in the central lymph nodes as described athough these are not pathological by CT size criteria.
Acute blood loss/anemia: On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 79194**] vital signs were stable and she was anemic to 17.7 (baseline Hct mid 20s secondary to Fe deficiency).
She received 1 units PRBCs in the ED and 2 units in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with appropriate Hct bumps.
On hospital day 2 her Hct was stable in the low 30s without transfusions over the past 24 hours.
Hct remained stable in the high 20s for the last several days, with most recent value 27.1.
Pneumonia: CXR at admission showed new infiltrate in RUL, likely a pneumonia.
WBC was 11 on day 1, up to 18.8 on day 2 (75% PMNs, no bands), but she remained afebrile.
Initial lactate was 2.7.
CXR showed evolution of the right middle lobe infiltrate, and then after a trigger for hypoxia on [**8-4**], a new infiltrate on the right base.
SHE WILL NEED REPEAT CHEST XRAY IN 3 week VERIFY RESOLUTION, GIVEN ROUNDED APPEARANCE OF PNEUMONIA IN RIGHT MID LUNG, AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT AT RIGHT BASE.
19. chest xray 1 week, to assess right lower lobe and mid lobe 20.

You will need further testing in the outpatient setting to identify a source of bleeding.
You will need a repeat chest xray as there is a possible nodule on your chest xray - in 1 week, and probably a chest CT .
