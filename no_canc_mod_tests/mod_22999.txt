Pertinent Results: [**2184-8-7**] 07:00AM BLOOD WBC-5.2 RBC-3.41* Hgb-10.8* Hct-32.0* MCV-94 MCH-31.8 MCHC-33.8 RDW-14.4 Plt Ct-269 [**2184-8-18**] 01:00PM BLOOD Plt Ct-296  IMAGING: [**6-23**] (CXR) - no ptx, no effusion, no mediastinal widening [**6-23**] (C-Spine OSH) - C4-5 subluxation fx [**6-23**] (CT Head OSH) - (reportedly) negative [**6-24**] (MRI C-spine) - 1.
[**6-28**] (KUB - PEG Contrast Scan): no contrast extrav [**6-29**] (CXR): Desaturation and increased FiO2 with right lung base consolidation on CXR - Bronchoscopy with BAL (Bronchus intermedius BAL and RLL BAL with Left BAL) performed; Patient started on Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for suspected VAP.
[**7-1**] (CXR): RLL pneumonia, unchanged pneumoperitoneum [**7-2**] (Renal US): Normal renal ultrasound [**7-2**] (2D-Echo): LVEF 65%.
[**7-3**] (KUB): contrast study PEG w no extrav; +significant free air [**7-4**] (CT torso): B pleural effusions, complete collapse of RLL c/w consolidation, mod pneumoperitoneum likely d/t PEG air leak, no e/o solid viscus perf, rounded focus of consolidation in LUL likely infection [**7-22**] (LENIs): No evidence DVT [**7-23**] (CT neck/torso): No fluid collxn, lymphadenopathy or bony destruction in neck.
His motor exam stabilized over the course of his ICU stay with 3-4/5 strength in his bilateral biceps.
His depression was thought to be an appropriate response given the circumstances and he was started on antidepressant therapy and followed closely by Social work during his stay who felt his coping was appropriate as well.
At time of discharge, his blood pressures are stable ranging between 98-114 systolic.
Early he had continued desaturation episodes and CXR imaging was concerning for mucous plugging.
BAL cultures were sent when appropriate.
His saturations ranging 97-98%.
On POD 2 from the PEG placement, routine CXR showed large amount of pneumoperitoneum (he also spiked a temperature and showed signs of consolidation.
His tube feeds were held and a tube contrast study was performed to rule out malposition or contrast extravasation and it was negative.
As noted above, he was started on vanc/cipro/zosyn for presumed PNA which was ultimately tailored after cultures from sputum/BAL showed MSSA.
Additionally he was started on micafungin on [**6-30**] due to blood cultures growing yeast.
As a result, an ID consult was obtained and recommended echo, renal ultrasound and ophtho exam to rule out complications of fungemia.
His ECHO showed no definite vegetations and normal EF%.
His renal ultrasound was also normal and Ophth exam unremarkable.
Heme: He has been receiving subcutaneous heparin since admission and should have his plt count monitored at lead every [**9-17**] days.
His most recent plt count was 296 on [**2184-8-18**].
