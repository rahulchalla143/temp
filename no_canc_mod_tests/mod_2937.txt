After patient was intubated, his mental status recovered and O2 saturations were normal without respiratory support from the ventilator.
Lumbar puncture was performed, showing a lymphocytic meningitis indicative of a possible zoster meningitis.
CSF fluid was apparently not plentiful enough to be suitable for VZV or HSV PCR, so these tests could not be performed.
ID consult felt that patient's CXR was not indicative of VZV pneumonitis.
CT chest was not performed, as treatment would not change if pneumonitis were present.
Patient developed a rash over his eyes, which ID felt was seborrheic dermatitis and not linked with zoster ophthalmicus.
# Anemia of chronic disease: Patient's Hct remained stable in the low 30s, high 20s throughout admission.
Initial Hct drop was attributed to active IVF hydration because of treatment with acyclovir.
Patient was cleared by speech and swallow eval to have food of ground consistency with thin fluids.
