PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon presentation to the hospital, patient's temperature was 97.9, blood pressure 108/96, pulse 64, respirations 16, 98% on room air.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Patient's dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were not palpable.
The patient was on anticoagulation due to her aortic valve replacement, thus was waiting for her coagulation factors to be more optimal for operative management of her hip.
Patient's temperature dropped to 94, Lactate was 17.5, hematocrit 20 which dropped earlier in the day on [**10-27**] from 29.3.
The patient was transferred to the MICU for evaluation for decreased hematocrit, decreased blood pressure.
It was found upon further evaluation that patient was having a brisk lumbar artery bleed secondary to her fall.
LABORATORY DATA:  Upon presentation to the hospital, white count was 13, hematocrit 29, INR 4.3, PTT 150, ESR 77, CRP 2.1.
Urinalysis was negative for nitrites, [**5-11**] white blood cells per high power field.
Chem 7, sodium 136, potassium 4.9, chloride 100, CO2 24, creatinine 2.0, glucose 230.
This fall was complicated by a retroperitoneal bleed from lumbar artery bleed.
Cardiovascular:  1) Hypovolemic shock - patient was found to have a lumbar artery bleed, was found to be hypotensive, diaphoretic.
Patient's hematocrit fell from 29 to 23.4 on [**10-25**] to 16.
The patient's blood pressures during the last week of [**Month/Year (2) 12876**] were in the 140's to 160's/80's to 90's, not requiring fluid resuscitation, not requiring pressors for majority of [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.
The patient's Heparin orders were weight based upon 55 kg with an ideal PTT between 60 and 100.
With questions of Coumadin dose, please call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 608**] which was patient's nurse practitioner [**First Name (Titles) 5001**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12876**].
The patient's oxygen requirements were decreased from 50% face tent to 35% face tent.
GI:  The patient had guaiac positive stool with her right lower quadrant pain and her hypovolemic shock due to lumbar artery bleed.
This acute increase in liver function tests were most likely secondary to shock liver due to hypoperfusion.
The patient's liver function tests decreased slowly during [**Hospital 228**] hospital course and on day of discharge patient's ALT was 53, AST 27, alkaline phosphatase 105, bilirubin 1.7.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was done which showed cholelithiasis and no evidence of cholecystitis.
Patient's base creatinine was 2.0.
As patient lives adequately fluid resuscitated and improved during the hospital stay, patient's urine output became adequate and patient's creatinine began to creep downward slowly and on hospital day #16, [**11-7**], patient's creatinine reached a nadir of 1.6.
The patient actually was hypothermic during patient's hypovolemic shock with a temperature nadir of 94 degrees.
The patient did have an increase in white cell count during [**Month/Day (2) 12876**] with a max of 28.9 with an unclear source of why the white cell count went up.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed no evidence of cholecystitis.
Patient's white cell count did start to go down on day of discharge, [**11-7**].
A C. diff culture for stool was sent which was negative.
The patient's central line tip was sent for culture which is still pending upon discharge.
Patient's white cell count most likely due to pneumonia.
There was a question of a stroke but a head CT was negative for evidence of stroke.
During patient's MICU stay it was thought that an MRI and EEG would be needed but with patient's improvement an MRI and EEG were not done.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  Upon patient's hypovolemic shock patient was made npo.
The patient was started on tube feeds with a goal of 40 cc per hour and held for residuals of greater than 100 cc per hour.
Patient improved on [**11-6**] and a video swallowing study was scheduled.
Video swallowing study was done on [**11-7**] which showed that the patient still had risk of aspiration, thus speech pathology recommended that patient continue on tube feeds with NG tube for one week and then retry with an other video swallow to see whether patient is less of an aspiration risk.
The patient became hypernatremic during hospital stay with sodium in the max of 150.
Patient should continue on tube feeds, the Ultracal at 55 cc per hour to be held for residuals of greater than 100 cc.
