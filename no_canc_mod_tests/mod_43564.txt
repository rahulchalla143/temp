At [**Hospital 882**] hospital, A CXR was done which per report showed pulmonary infiltrates consistent with PNA.
BNP from [**Hospital1 882**] was > [**Numeric Identifier 2249**] so concern was for PE.
CTA was done and showed no PE but confirmed RLL consolidation.

TECHNIQUE: CTA chest without and with contrast and coronal and sagittal reformatted images.
COMPARISON: Compared to chest radiograph from [**2131-11-2**].
Evaluation of lungs suboptimal, due to breathing motion.
This study is not tailored for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic contents.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

TTE EF25-30.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic blood  pressure of 121/57 mmHg.
Saphenous vein graft angiography revealed the SVG-PDA was occluded proximally.
ARterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA-diagonal to be patent with supplies a collateral to the OMB.

PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: In comparison to the prior study, there has been no significant change.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-11-3**], the findings are similar.
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 9.8 cm and the left kidney measures 9.4 cm.
The exam was performed at the bedside, and is not adequate for evaluation of focal space-occupying lesions.

# Systolic CHF: Has ischemic CM with EF of 25-30% with new documentation of inferior LV aneurysm on most recent ECHO [**11-16**] (she is not yet anticoagulated on coumadin due to occult GIB see below).
She should have her digoxin level checked as an outpatient in 6 wks, it was still below normal range at 0.4 upon discharge.
Subsequent cath showed 3 vessel CAD, patent LIMA-diagonal, patent SVG-LAD, occluded SVG-OM and SVG-RCA, normal systemic blood pressure, mild left subclavian stenosis.
We recomend an outpatient GI workup before starting coumadin for afib / new LV aneurysm.
She remained afebrile throughout, and her blood/urine cultures remained neg, C diff neg on multiple checks.
Her WBC may have been secondary to 4 days of solumedrol in ICU, as well as large [**Hospital1 7792**] and undergoing cath and pacer placement.
Hct now stable at 30.7 (last tx on [**11-16**]).
Iron studies this admission consistent with anemia of chronic disease.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 392**] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: multifocal pneumonia asthma exacerbation [**Hospital1 7792**] atrial fibrillation AV heart block acute on chronic renal insufficiency .
Your kidneys also had dysfunction which improved.
Your blood counts improved as well.
You will need an outpatient workup for your GI bleed before you can start coumadin for your atrial fibrillation and your aneurysm in your heart ventricle.
Please follow up with your cardiologist in the next 2-3 weeks, please have your digoxin level checked in 6 weeks.
