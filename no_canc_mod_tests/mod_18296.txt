The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was intubated and sedated.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Bedside echocardiogram revealed no wall motion abnormalities, normal ejection fraction, no valvular abnormalities.
An electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed sinus bradycardia at 33, left axis deviation, T wave inversions in III.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories an outside hospital revealed sodium was 134, potassium was 3.5, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 42, creatinine was 2.9, and her blood glucose was 85.
Protein was 5.7.
Albumin was 2.6.
Calcium was 9.
Total bilirubin was 0.18.
Alkaline phosphatase was 108, alanine-aminotransferase was 34, aspartate aminotransferase was 29.
Creatine kinase was 161.
MB was 18.
Troponin was less than 0.01.
White blood cell count was 4.4, her hematocrit was 31, and her platelets were 171.
Differential with neutrophils of 81, lymphocytes of 13, and monocytes of 5.2.
Laboratories at [**Hospital1 69**] revealed her white blood cell count was 6.6, her hematocrit was 39.8, and platelets were 211.
Differential with neutrophils of 88.7.
INR was 1.1.
Prothrombin time was 12.9 and partial thromboplastin time was 37.3.
Urinalysis was unremarkable.
Sodium was 134, potassium was 3.2, chloride was 97, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen was 44, creatinine was 3.1, and blood glucose was 100.
Her alanine-aminotransferase was 31, her aspartate aminotransferase was 31, alkaline phosphatase was 115, and her total bilirubin was 0.3.
CK/MB was 45.
Troponin was 0.13.
Calcium was 9.6, magnesium was 2.2, and her phosphate was 5.1.
Arterial blood gas revealed pH of 7.4, PCO2 was 35, PO2 was 454 on 100% assist control.
Total volume 500.
A sepsis workup was sent off which included blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum culture.
The urine culture was unremarkable.
The sputum culture was unremarkable as well as blood cultures.
A chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe collapse and questionable consolidation.
The patient had a triple lumen placed for access and aggressive intravenous fluid hydration.
The patient was started on dopamine and later on was changed to Levophed for blood pressure support.
The patient was admitted to the Unit from an outside hospital with an external pacemaker, heart beating at 60, and a blood pressure of 100/60.
On admission, her bradycardia has resolved, and she had a regular rate.
Given the patient's elevated cardiac enzymes with a troponin of 0.15 in the setting of renal insufficiency, the troponin leak was attributed to demand ischemia and not acute coronary syndrome.
Her electrolytes were followed on a daily basis, and medications were renally dosed.
Her hematocrit dropped secondary to large intravenous fluid hydration and volume given.
Her blood sugar was checked and noted to be 37.
