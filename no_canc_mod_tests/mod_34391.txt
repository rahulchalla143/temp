At [**Location (un) 620**] she was noted to be in 2:1 heart block with bradycardia to 30s-40s and BP 170-200/40-60.
HR had minimal response but blood pressure remained stable at SBP 160s.

ECG [**6-2**] Sinus rhythm with atrial sensed and ventricular paced Since previous tracing of [**2174-5-31**], trate slower and atrial pacing not seen   .
=========== Radiology =========== CXR [**2174-5-28**] AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The heart is moderately enlarged.
CXR [**2174-6-2**]: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient with heart block after recent pacemaker placement.
PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to [**2174-5-31**].
Head CT [**2174-6-1**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
The team also considered ischemic etiologies (accounts for 40% cases of AV block) but cardiac biomarkers were flat and no ischemic changes on EKG.
CXR showed proper lead placement and no PTX.
EKG without ischemic changes.
ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 was admitted with Cr 1.5 that downtrended.
TSH 10.
You had a pacemaker placed to prevent your heart rate from going to slowly.
PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 357**] make an appt to see PCP 1-2 weeks after discharge from [**Location (un) **] .
