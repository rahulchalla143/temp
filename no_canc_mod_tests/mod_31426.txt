PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission, temperature 98.1, heart rate 66, blood pressure 108/88, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 95 percent in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - Jugular venous distention to ten centimeters.
Initial workup included echocardiogram as well as heart failure consult.
Ultimately the patient went for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging that showed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with preserved left ventricular function and increased left ventricular size.
Echocardiogram done shortly after admission showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent with a left atrium that is mildly dilated, right ventricle that was markedly dilated with severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, two plus mitral regurgitation and four plus tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and, on [**2145-7-27**], he underwent cardiac catheterization that showed severe pulmonary arterial hypertension unresponsive to nitrate and clean coronaries following which cardiothoracic surgery was consulted.
He had a mean arterial pressure of 53 and he was V paced at a rate of 80 with a PAD of 21.
Additionally, the patient had Epinephrine infusion of 0.3 mcg/kg/minute.
On postoperative day three, the patient returned to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory at which time a permanent pacemaker was implanted due to the patient's bradycardic episodes during his preoperative course.
His chest x-ray showed worsening congestive heart failure.
He became increasingly acidotic and his white blood cell count went to 27.4.
Abdominal ultrasound showed dilated gallbladder and the patient was brought to the operating room for an open cholecystectomy.
A bronchoscopy done after the tracheostomy showed bright red blood within the trachea and the patient was brought to the operating room where they found bleeding from the thyroid isthmus.
The patient's physical examination is as follows: Temperature 100, heart rate 70, V paced, blood pressure 120/50, respiratory rate 29, oxygen saturation 95 percent on assist control, tidal volume of 550, respiratory rate of 24, FIO2 60 percent with 10 of PEEP.
Blood gas 7.48, 39, 91.
White blood cell count 10.9, hematocrit 29.8, platelet count 324,000.
Prothrombin time 14.0, partial thromboplastin time 29.3, INR 1.2.
Sodium 136, potassium 4.1, chloride 102, CO2 28, blood urea nitrogen 23, creatinine 1.1, glucose 101.
for    temperature greater than 38.
Lorazepam 0.5 to 1 mg q4hours p.r.n.
Warfarin 2 mg as directed to maintain a goal INR of    1.5 to 2.0.
He is to have his partial thromboplastin time INR checked daily with Heparin and Warfarin doses adjusted accordingly to maintain a partial thromboplastin time of 40 and an INR of 1.5 to 2.0.
He has tube feeds that are Respalor with the goal rate being 60 cc/hour.
