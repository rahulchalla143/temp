His blood press [**Last Name (un) **] was 240/130 by EMS.
Malignant hypertension with poor control of his blood pressure which is quite labile and has led to multiple admissions to [**Hospital1 69**] for abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
An extensive workup to date has revealed no cause.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.7-1.9.
Vital signs:  Temperature 99.4, blood pressure 130/80, heart rate 84, respiratory rate 22, and pulse oximetry 96% on room air.
Heart regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.3.

Electrolytes:  Sodium 137, potassium 4.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate 27, BUN 33, creatinine 1.6, glucose 274.
To evaluate this possibility further, a MIBG scan was scheduled for the following week.
As his blood pressure continued to be quite labile, it was clear that closer monitoring and better control of his blood pressure was indicated, therefore the patient was transferred to the MICU on [**1-7**], where a Nipride drip was started.
Patient was weaned off all of his calcium-channel blockers, alpha blockers, and beta blockers in preparation for the MIBG scan, which occurred on [**1-8**] and [**1-10**].
Patient was transferred back to Medicine floor on [**1-10**] and on [**1-11**], his blood pressure was well controlled on his regular oral antihypertensive regimen.
The results of the MIBG scan were pending at the time of discharge.
Renal:  Patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.7 to 1.9.
During his hospital stay, his creatinine rose up to 2.6.
Prerenal etiology was initially suspected but was not supported by FENa calculation as creatinine elevation was thought to be due to hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy.
If systolic blood pressures greater than 150, please contact your primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] systolic blood pressures greater than 170, please report to the Emergency Department for blood pressure control.
