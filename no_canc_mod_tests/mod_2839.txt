He was advised by his cardiologist to have an electrophysiological study with mapping and ablation of his ventricular tachycardia focus.
His femoral catheterization sheath was removed, and direct pressure was applied to the bleeding site for over two hours.
Throughout this time, his blood pressure remained stable in the 140s/50s with heart rate in the 60s.
A STAT hematocrit laboratory value was sent with result of 26.4.
In the interim, the patient was sent for an ultrasound which demonstrated no evidence of pseudoaneurysm formation at the site of the femoral hematoma.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further monitoring.
Repeat hematocrit was sent with a value of 37.5.
Stress echocardiogram in [**2181**] showed no evidence of ischemia.
Vitamins B12 and B6.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:  Vital signs showed a temperature of 98.8, blood pressure 126/52, heart rate 80, respiratory rate 21, oxygen saturation 99% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anterolaterally.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses 1+ palpated bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORIES, X-RAYS, AND OTHER STUDIES:  Complete blood count on admission showed white blood cells of 8.3, hemoglobin of 8.5, hematocrit 26.4, platelet count 186.
Repeat hematocrit drawn after arrival to the Coronary Care Unit was 37.5.
Coagulation profile showed a PT of 14.0, INR 1.3.
Serum chemistries demonstrated a sodium of 144, potassium 3.5, chloride 115, bicarbonate 21, BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, glucose 164.
Electrocardiogram after ablation showed normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute.
On hospital day #2, an echocardiogram was done to assess the patient's left ventricular function and assess for any valvular abnormalities.
Echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 40%, mild left atrial dilatation.
The echocardiogram was unable to assess pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
He did not have any evidence of ectopy on telemetry monitoring.
Additionally, Vascular Surgery was following the patient and recommended serial hematocrit checks q4h with a goal to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 in light of his coronary artery disease history.
However, prior to transfusion, a repeat hematocrit was sent, which demonstrated a value of 37.3.
Throughout the hospital course, his hematocrit slowly trended down to a value of 27.4.
He tolerated this well, and at the time of discharge, his hematocrit was stable at a value of 30.3.
Additionally, he was monitored with qid fingerstick blood glucose testing and covered with a regular insulin-sliding scale.
Humalog 75/25 36 units q am, 26 units q pm.
