On presentation to the Emergency Department, patient had a temperature of 101.9 F, heart rate of 126, blood pressure 156/85, breathing rate of 28, saturating at 83% on room air.
Patient received a chest x-ray which showed questionable early left lower lobe infiltrate with atelectasis.
EKG showed patient in sinus tach with poor R wave progression, left axis deviation, no signs of ischemia.
Exploratory laparotomy for abdominal mass versus uterine cyst.

Sodium 137, potassium 4.0, chloride 102, bicarbonate 24, BUN 10, creatinine 0.7, glucose of 197.
Patient received oxygen via face mask to keep saturations greater than 92%.
ABG was performed at this time that showed a pH of 7.35, pCO2 of 58, pO2 of 132.
Patient received cardiac echo for evaluation of possible congestive heart failure.
Cavity size and systolic function were all normal with a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55% and normal left ventricular region wall motion unchanged in the interval from previous echo of [**2163-5-6**].
Patient had chest x-ray at this time which showed interval resolution of patient's pulmonary opacities.
Pulmonary consult was obtained for more input on patient's worsening respiratory status who advised patient receive chest CT Scan.
The chest CT Scan was consistent with worsening interstitial lung disease.
