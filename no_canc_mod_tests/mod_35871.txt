Magnetic resonance imaging here demonstrated a new frontal parietal stroke on the right, again with decreased flow throughout her right MCA.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170 to 200/70 to 90, heart rate 60 to 90 in sinus and respiratory rate 16.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the above, the patient was heparinized, with a first partial thromboplastin time of 50 to 70 after she seemed to have an embolic stroke.
Estimated blood loss was 100 cc for the case.
Postoperatively, the patient was in the Vascular Intensive Care Unit for management of blood pressure and she was on a nitroglycerin drip which was weaned off as she was placed back on beta blockade with atenolol.
The remainder of her examination was benign.
