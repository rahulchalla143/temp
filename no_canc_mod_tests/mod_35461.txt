[**2175-8-9**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2175-8-14**] ERCP FINDINGS: Comparison is made with CT from [**8-12**], [**2174**] and prior ERCP from [**2175-8-8**].
A retrograde cholangiogram shows multiple filling defects, some of which likely represent stones, within otherwise normal- appearing biliary tree.
The patients lactate level, fevers and WBC were trended and returned to [**Location 213**].
His labile blood pressures also exacerbated his already fluid-overloaded state, making it difficult to wean off the vent.
The initiation of hemodialysis effectively controlled his BP and fluid status, and on day 7, after his second ERCP, he was extubated and started on CPAP overnight.
His levels slowly trended down post-ERCP except bilirubin and AP, which continued to rise.
The patient experienced intermittent epigastric discomfort which prompted a RUQ US, which showed a fatty liver but the common bile duct non-well visualised.
CT scan of abdomen showed no intrahepatic biliary dilatation, cholelithiasis, and a subtle hypodensity in pancreatic head.
The stent was replaced, antibiotics were continued, and the patient's enzymes and bilirubin were trended.
The following day HD was initiated with good response in blood pressure.
# Drug Rash: Patient developed a diffuse petticheal/macular rash on his chest and legs which was pruritic.
# CAD: An echo was performed to rule out endocarditis as a cause of fever.
His ECG had some ischemic changes of unclear duration, and the patient had no active symptoms.
Cardiac enzymes were stably elevated on admission and, in the setting of ESRD, this was unlikely to be acute event.
Hematocrit was trended and continued to improve with HD and management.
You will also need to follow-up with the Gastroenterology team to have a repeat ERCP 6 weeks with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
