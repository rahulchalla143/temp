An underlying mass cannot be exluced.
CTA on admission [**2175-12-28**]:  Compared to the prior study there has been no change in the large area of cytotoxic edema involving the left MCA territory.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK: The aortic arch, great vessels arising from it, common carotid arteries, internal carotid arteries, and vertebral arteries are normal in caliber, configuration and appearance.
There are prominent level 1 and level 2 lymph nodes which are symmetric bilaterally within the neck.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>60%).
MRI on admission [**2175-12-29**]:  FINDINGS: There is an extensive acute infarct involving the majority of the left MCA territory, with some sparing of the portions of the deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter and portions of the superior most gyri in the MCA distribution.
The extent is very similar to rule what was previously seen on CT and CTA.
The intracranial flow voids appear to demonstrate mild narrowing of the cavernous left ICA relative to the contralateral side, though this was not evident on the CTA (4:10).
Apparent interval narrowing of the left cavernous internal carotid artery flow void without development of any abnormal signal, of unclear significance given that this was not present on the CTA done approximately six hours earlier.
Doppler evaluation of the kidneys shows no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Repeat CTA on day of discharge [**2176-1-2**]:  Appears unchanged, although final Neuroradiology report is pending.
Over the course of her hospital stay, there was initial concern for malignant MCA syndrome (pathologic swelling of the infarcted MCA territory causing herniation and death), especially given the initial degree of edema and sulcal effacement (but no midline shift) seen on MRI and HCT on HD1-2.
Although there was never an increase in her serum Na or pOsm (never greater than ~142 or ~290, respectively) despite 3% NaCl infusion rates up to 80mL/h, she never developed exam findings or imaging changes c/f worsening edema or herniation (no lethargy, no cranial nerve findings, no autonomic changes).
Vitals were stable and normal.
General phsyical exam remained normal.
She passed Speech & Swallow evaluation (no aspiration) and was henceforth fed a Regular diet with thin liquids.
Her exam has been essentially stable, with minimal improvement, but surprisingly little impairment given the extent of the lesion.
On cerebrovascular imaging (CTA and MRA), there were no findings suggestive of atherosclerosis or vasculitis.
She does not have hypertension, does not smoke, and her fasting lipid panel was quite good with HDL 54 and LDL 76 (TC 148, Tg 89).
She does not have atrial fibrillation by history or on several days of cardiac telemtric monitoring here at [**Hospital1 18**], and does not have an ASD/PFO or intracardiac embolic source on TTE/TEE, which were normal.
The appearance of her infarcted brain territory fits an Arterial vascular distribution (Left MCA), and not a pattern of venous infarction; in any event, venous sinus thrombosis was essentially ruled out by the absence of any consistent findings on CTA and a negative/normal D-dimer on admission (257).
There no physical exam findings suggestive of venous thrombosis disease.
Third, she had severe iron-deficiency microcytic anemia (MCA 63, Hgbs in the 7s down to the high 6s) with an inappropriatly-low reticulocyte count of 2.4% and extremely low ferritin of 4.3 and iron of 14 (TIBC 569, TRF 438, also homocysteine 4.8, haptoglobin 66, LDH 215, fibrinogen 390, B12 359).
TSH was 1.7 (wnl), urine and serum tox screens were positive only for amphetamines (pt takes Rx Adderall at b/l) and UA was normal on admission (and UCx and MRSA screen were negative and pt remained afebrile throughout this admission).
[**Doctor First Name **] and dsDNA and RF (8) and B2-microglobulin (2.1) were all wnl/negative.
Anti-smooth muscle and anti-histone Abs are pending at this time.
CT images of the arteries in this region of the brain (branches of the middle cerebral artery) showed a narrowing just before the tissue that had a stroke; it is uncertain whether this is a cause or a consequence of the stroke.
