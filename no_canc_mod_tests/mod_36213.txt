The patient had an echocardiogram performed on [**2123-10-8**], which showed mitral valve to be rheumatically deformed with mild thickening, commissural fusion, mild chordal thickening and four plus mitral regurgitation.
The left ventricle appeared slightly enlarged with end-diastolic dimension of 5.5 and ejection fraction of approximately 60%.
In addition, the patient had cardiac catheterization performed on [**2123-10-22**], which showed normal coronary arteries, but severe mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic regurgitation, as well as moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
In addition, the patient was noted to have new small bilateral pleural effusions on the chest x-ray as well as small patchy and linear basilar opacities which were confirmed by the CT scan.
