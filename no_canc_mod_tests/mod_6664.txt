Blood and urine cultures are negative to date.
She underwent lumbar puncture which showed 5 WBC cells and slightly elevated protein and was initially treated empirically for bacterial meningitis as well as herpes encephalitis but culture was subsequently negative as was herpes PCR.
Echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction and no vegetations.
Cortisol was within normal limits.
Acute kidney injury: Creatine 1.3 from baseline 0.5 - 0.9 on presentation and resolved quickly after aggressive resuscitation.

Anemia: Hematocrit fell to the mid 20s from the mid 30s at baseline after aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Reticulocyte count was inappropriately low at 2.0.
Her hematocrit was stable during this admission but should be rechecked within one week of discharge to skilled nursing.
