Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy x2 central line placement tracheostomy G-J tube placement PRBC transfusion echocardiogram   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 106212**] is a 67 year-old gentleman with a history of HIV (last CD4 273, VL<50), as well as a history of DM type 2, CAD status post CABG and RCA stent, PVD, CRI, GERD, CHF, TIA and history of large cell lymphoma s/p chemotherapy in [**2189**], who now presents with worsening SOB and low-grade temperature.
Mr. [**Known lastname 106212**] was last admitted electively for the work-up of cognitive decline on [**2199-11-8**].
Work-up revealed no change in brain MRI, CSF with HIV viral load improved from prior but still high.
In the ED, vitals T 101.2, HR 95, regular, BP 167/67, RR 40, Sat 80% on room air.
Diastolic CHF 4.
DM type 2 7.
Family History: Sister died of CAD and CVA Brother has h/o CAD Mother has h/o CAD  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITALS: T 101.2, HR 95, BP 140s/80s, RR 22, Sat 100% on NRB GEN: Emaciated man, hard of hearing, in NAD.
Pedal pulses not palpable.
Pertinent Results: Relevant laboratory data on admission: CBC: WBC 14.8, Hb 12.7, Hct 35.4 (was 42 on [**2199-12-30**]), Plt 205.
Chemistry: Na 132, K 6.7 (hemolysed, repeat 3.8), Cl 97, HCO3 25, BUN 30, Creat 2.2 (was 0.8 in [**11/2199**]), Glucose 115, Ca 9.5, Mg 2.2, Phos 3.4.
AST 99, ALT 30, ALP 84, LDH 1114, Amylase 60, lipase 37, T bili 0.6 CK 408, MB 7  CD4 273, VL <50 on [**2199-12-30**] Blood culture pending.
SINGLE VIEW CHEST, AP: There has been interval development of bilateral patchy alveolar opacities and increased interstitial opacities.
CXR at that time demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates with thick consolidation of RUL consistent with either aspiration or worsening lobar PNA.
CXR done 2 days later showed significant clearing of infiltrates with persistent RUL consolidation, so it was felt pt had aspiration pneumonitis.
pulmonary hemorrhage basically excluded by CT chest on [**2200-2-6**] NOT revealing pulmonary hemorrhage and anti-GBM and ANCA were negative.
-- Multiple sputum Cx's and BAL x 2 never yielded a pathogen [PCP (-) x 2, influenza (-)x2, [**Date Range **] (-), AFB (-), viral cultures (-)x2].
Bronchoscopy x 2 revealed minimal secretions.
BCx negative x12 sets (including fungal isolates).
-- LENIs were done x2 and no DVT found; bedside TTE on [**2200-2-8**] showed no evidence of RV failure in setting of acute decompensation -- A PA catheter was placed on [**2-12**] to better evaluate volume status given ?
Cultures remained negative and pt did have intermitent low grade temps spikes attributed to intermitent aspiration.
however, labs were also c/w pre-renal etiology.
throughout his MICU stay, he episodically dropped his hct but responded to transfusions.
-- his stool was guaiac negative x4 initially and CT abd x 2 w/o source of bleed.
CT Chest w/o evidence of alveolar hemorrhage.
iron studies with low iron and TIBC, but elevtaed ferritin after transfusiuons- like anemia secondary to iron deficiency and chronic disease and HAART medications.
This can continued to be followed as an outpatient and consider EGD or colonoscopy in future once acute issues resolved.
as his drop in hct was not critical, it is reasonable to follow up with outpatient EGD if it continues to be an issue -- ID did not feel his HAART medications were contributing to his anemia * 5.
legionella negative - last temp spike [**2200-2-24**], but thought secondary to aspirations as cultures remained negative and CXR improved.
CHF:  TTE was performed [**2200-2-4**] which showed EF >55% with E/A of 2.4, which was felt [**2-5**] to diastolic dysfunction.
His blood pressure was monitored and he was maintained on metoprolol, amlodopine, hydralazine and isordil with as needed doses of lasix.
CAD: CAD s/p CABG s/p stent [**10-6**] - no active signs of ischemia and EKG unchanged - Ruled out for MI with 3 neg CE's twice - increased trop likely secondary to ARF - FLP checked and LDL 60 - continued on asprin and [**Year (2 digits) 4532**] * 8.
