She was brought to OSH where head CT revealed diffuse SAH.
Recommend interventional neuroradiology consult and conventional angiogram for appropriate management and detection of any other additional aneurysms.
[**2161-8-20**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2161-8-23**] CTA Head: HEAD CTA: The intracranial internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and their major branches, appear patent.
Evaluation for residual filling of the previously coiled distal left anterior cerebral artery aneurysm is limited by streak artifact.
CTA Head [**2161-8-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CTA Head [**2161-8-29**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT shows removal of the right frontal ventricular drain without evidence of hydrocephalus.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates improvement in the caliber of the anterior cerebral arteries without evidence of vasospasm.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 8529**] was admitted to the Neurosurgery service and taken to the angio suite emergently for an angiogram and coiling.
She had a CTA on [**8-23**] that showed no evidence of vasospasm.
On [**8-24**] she was febrile and CSF was sent.
The gram stain was negative and later final cultures showed no growth.
Her exam remained stable and her EVD was raised to 15 without issue.
On [**8-25**] her exam and ICPs remained stable and her EVD was raised to 20.
TCDs were obtained which showed no evidence of vasospasm.
CTA on [**8-27**] revealed spasm in the A2, we elevated her blood pressure to 160-180 and started IVF.
On [**8-28**] LENIs were performed which revealed no evidence of a DVT.
A routine CT performed revealed stable ventricular size, but we opted to keep the ventricular drain in place given intermitant elevations in her ICP.
Over the next 24 hours the patient remained neurologically stable without sustained elevation in ICPS and so her EVD was removed on [**8-29**].
CTA was performed after Drain removal which demonstrated improvement in vasospasm, no hemorrhage with stable ventricular size.
Her blood pressure was liberalized to 90-160.
You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
