In the [**Hospital1 **] [**Name (NI) **], pt afebrile, but SBP 50s.
Magnesium was repleted, and he received one shock with recovery of Normal Sinus rhythm.
Of note, CT scan done in ED showed pancolitis.
C diff from [**11-18**] was positive.
Because of this worsening of dyspnea CE were drawn and showed elevated Trop-T to 3.12 and CK of 15 c/w NSTEMI.
On [**11-25**] BP stablized and pt has responded with increased urine output to Lasix IV bolus with Metolazone.

Interval worsening in now large bilateral pleural effusions (compared to CT [**2179-11-18**], but similar to CT [**2179-9-29**]), without evidence of loculated component.
This finding was called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2179-11-25**]  [**11-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-24**], there is again moderate-to- severe pulmonary edema with substantial pleural effusions bilaterally and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
ECHO [**12-23**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-12-3**], the findings are similar.

The etiology of the arrest is likely due to severe electrolyte derangements, including a magnesium of 0.8 that was in the process of repletion.
Cardiac enzymes were trended and were markedly elevated as expected after defibrillation and troponin reached a peak of 1.95 and then trended downward.
He was initially placed on aspirin , plavix and atorvastatin 80mg and later re-started on metoprolol as tolerated by his blood pressure.
Cardiac Enzymes were again drawn and showed an increased troponin to 3.12, up from 1.52 five days prior.
Troponin peaked at 3.58 and trended down.
On [**11-29**], pt had an episode of hypotension with SBP 84.
An EKG was done which showed marked TWI in V2-V4 and ST elevations in II,III and AVF.
# Asymptomatic hypotension: pt triggered multiple times on floor for SBP 70-80.
Pts bp tends to be low (85 to 110s).
repeated full workups, last on [**12-23**] w/ cxr (improved), blood cx(NGTD), [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim borderline (low baseline, but response to cosyntropin).
An MRI/MRA was done which did not show evidence of embolic dz or stroke.
