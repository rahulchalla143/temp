Facial CT revealed bilateral ZMC fractures, and a dislocated R orbital lens implant.
Outside imaging had demonstrated a skull base fracture-- a repeat head CTA was performed, which showed a non-displaced R sphenoid sinus fracture but no vascular injury.
All other imaging performed demonstrated no abnormality: TLS spine XR, AP chest + pelvis, C-spine CT.
