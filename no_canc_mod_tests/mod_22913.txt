High density within the wall of the aorta, on correlation with the recent CT, imaging features are suggestive of an intramural hematoma.
Delayed excretion of contrast from the left kidney consistent with renal dysfunction.
MRI 1.
She was observed at the CVICU for strict monitoring of blood pressure (SBP< 140).
Her hospital stay can be summarized by the following review of systems -  Neuro: Pt pain controlled with iv and oral narcotics.
Angiogram showed normal aorta despite findings on MRI.
Renal: Acute/chronic RF with Cr 1.2 at baseline.
After her procedure, Cr did decrease to 1.5 on discharge.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
