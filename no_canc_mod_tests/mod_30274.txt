When the g-tube was placed to gravity, 200 cc of thick green pus came out of the tube this morning, and pus was easily expressed around the site.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Currently she is responsive to voice, able to follow commands and answer questions; denies pain but heavily grimaces with palpation of her abdomen.
Her daughter, [**Name (NI) 17**] [**Known lastname 2455**], lives in [**Name (NI) 3844**].
Moves all extremities, follows commands including finger grip.
Pertinent Results: [**7-15**]- blood cultures positive for MSSA [**7-19**]- blood cultures negative [**7-16**]- cath tip negative [**7-17**]- pleural fluid negative [**7-28**]- PEG swab: 2+ PMNs, 2+ GNRs, mod growth GNRs (sparse pseudomonas - pan-sensitive; sparse strep viridans) [**7-31**] - abscess swab with 1+ PMN, 1+ GPR, 1 GNR [**7-31**] - abscess drainage with 2+ PMN, 4+ GNR, 3+ GPR, 3+ yeast, 1+ GPC in pairs and clusters [**2132-8-6**] sputum: 4+ GNRs, 1+ budding yeasts .
[**7-29**] I+O- CT abd/pelvis: prelim report shows evidence of 9cmx3cm abscess extending from g-tube into pelvis .
[**2132-8-6**] CT head: slight decrease in size of L frontal SDH.
# A-fib - H/o of A fib during prior admission, on [**8-3**] in afib with RVR up to 130's-140s.
HR reduced to 90s with 3x 5mg IV dilt on [**8-3**].
She continued to be in afib with better rate control until [**8-5**] - increasing HR into 130s unresponsive to IV amiodarone and diltiazem with decreasing MAPs.
Pt tried on esmolol drip for rate control on [**8-6**] which failed secondary to poor rate control and decrease in SBPs to 80s.
Improved rate control with po diltiazem (90s-100s) briefly despite levophed; however she continued to demonstrate rapid ventricular rate on [**8-9**].
Phenylephrine drip was used to maintain blood pressure and increased to maintain MAPs 50-60s.
She was given multiple crystalloid boluses per day and many colloid boluses, including 2u PRBC on [**7-29**], 25mg albumin on [**7-31**], and 1uPRBC and 25g albumin on [**8-1**] with UOP consistently ~20cc/hr.
There was evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR and much peripheral edema on exam without evidence of oxygen desaturation.
Pt was aggressivley hydrated with good response to  UOP and CVP at target (19-20); however, aggressive hydration was held per increased pulmonary edema on CXR with increasing FiO2 requirement.
[**2132-8-6**] CXR showed diffuse pulmonary edema with large bilateral effusions, likely a result of aggressive fluids.
CT abdomen/ pelvis [**7-29**] showed presence of 9cmx3cm abscess from g-tube to pelvis.
PEG tube swab showed 2+GNR with sparse growth of pseudomonas.
Levo/ flagyl for gut flora coverage was started on admission --> changed to aztreonam on [**7-30**] when wound culture grew pseudomonas --> flagyl restarted and fluconazole added on [**7-31**] for anaerobic and yeast coverage s/p surgical debridement; patient was on vancomycin, flagyl, and fluconazole when she expired.
She was kept on a heparin drip titrated to PTT 60-80 and her hand was kept elevated.
Pt was transfused 2u PRBC for goal hct > 30 on [**7-29**], and 1u PRBC on [**8-1**] for goal hct > 25.
urine lytes c/w type 1 RTA.
