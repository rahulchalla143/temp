In the Emergency Room, the patient had an abdominal CAT scan which showed thrombosis of the left renal artery and necrosis of a large portion of his left kidney.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination at the time of presentation revealed the patient had a temperature of 97.2, a blood pressure of 219/122, a heart rate of 80, a respiratory rate of 18, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on an unknown amount of oxygen.
Head and neck examination showed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
His neck showed a jugular venous pressure of less than 10.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were intact.
The patient's strength was [**3-21**] in the upper and lower extremities, and his reflexes were 2+ bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories at the time of admission revealed the patient had a white blood cell count of 6.6, a hematocrit of 51.2, and platelets of 224.
His differential showed 48 polys and 43 lymphocytes.
Chem-7 showed a sodium of 140, potassium of 3.8, chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 20, blood urea nitrogen of 17, creatinine of 1.4.
The patient had an arterial blood gas in the Emergency Room which was 7.39/30/36 with a lactate of 6.6.
The patient had a PT of 14.8, a PTT of 30.7, and an INR of 1.5.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed a leftward axis with intraventricular conduction delay, left atrial enlargement, and a left bundloid appearance, left ventricular hypertrophy; there were no significant changes as compared with old study.
On abdominal CT, there was occlusion of the left renal artery with necrosis of the left kidney which appeared swollen and acute.
However, on hospital day two his white blood cell count increased from 6 to 20 with a high number of bands.
His creatinine increased from 1.4 to 2.2, and his abdominal pain worsened significantly.
The patient was evaluated by Urology, Vascular Surgery, and General Surgery who all felt that the patient needed an emergent abdominal angiogram to assess the extent of his superior mesenteric artery clot and mesenteric ischemia.
This angiogram was performed on hospital day two and showed severe atherosclerotic disease throughout the aorta, iliac, and femoral vessels.
After hearing Dr.[**Name (NI) 1745**] description of the extensive surgery and multiple ostomies that would likely be necessary to remove necrotic bowel, the patient and his family refused surgical intervention.
He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography of the head on hospital day three for evaluation of a new left third nerve palsy since presentation.
On this magnetic resonance imaging, the patient was noted to have an incidental finding of a aneurysm in the trifurcation of the middle cerebral artery.
Late on hospital day three, the patient began to have progressive hypoxia and hypotension with blood pressures in the 70s/40s.
The patient began to have runs of significant tachycardia to the 190s and runs of ventricular tachycardia lasting 20 to 30 beats.
