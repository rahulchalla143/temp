He was treated at the time with IV Solu-Medrol one dose and nebulizers twice, and discharged home and O2 saturation was approximately 95% on 4 liters of oxygen (baseline).
Vitals showed a pulse of 96, blood pressure of 156/96, respiratory rate of 28-32, and an O2 saturation of 100% after nebulizer treatment.
He desaturated from 90% to 60%, but refused intubation, so he was placed on heliox without any improvement.
ABGs drawn at that time showed a pH of 7.23 and a pCO2 of 85.
While in the MICU, he was started on BiPAP with O2 saturations ranging from 88 to 92%, however, he had another episode of desaturation and he was put back on 100% nonrebreather mask restoring his saturations.
60 mg.  His nebulizers were weaned down to q2-3h and he was weaned down to nasal cannula on 2 liters and maintaining his sats around 90-93%.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55% at that time with right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation of the right ventricle with global hypokinesis of the right ventricle and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
He was scheduled to undergo a stress test at the time, but has not gone.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 170/113, pulse is 103 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22, and 100% oxygen on 100% nonrebreather mask.
His neck showed no jugular venous distention.
His chest showed moderate air movement with expiratory wheezes and hyperresonant to percussion.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count of 6, hematocrit of 44.6, platelets of 256.
He had a sodium of 135, potassium of 4.8, chloride of 94, bicarbonate of 40, BUN of 9, creatinine of 0.7, and a sugar of 141.
Calcium was 9.0, magnesium was 1.9 and phosphate was 2.4.
His urinalysis was negative.
Urine cultures were sent.
Chest x-ray done showed no CHF or focal consolidation, but evidence of hyperinflation consistent with emphysema.
EKG shows sinus rhythm at 97 beats per minute with atrial premature beats, which were new since the last tracing of [**2180-3-27**], normal axis, normal intervals, and no ST segment changes.
nebulizer treatments and was noticeably feeling much better with O2 saturations ranging between 95 and 98% on 2 liter nasal cannula.
Per PCP's recommendations, a chest CT was ordered which showed severe bullous emphysema with large bullae at the left apex and no pulmonary nodule or mass corresponding to the abnormality described by the chest x-ray.
Coronary artery disease:  EKG showed new onset of atrial premature beats.
