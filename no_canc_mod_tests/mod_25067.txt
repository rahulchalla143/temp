Pathology Report DIFFICULT CROSSMATCH AND/OR EVALUATION OF IRREGULAR ANTIBODIES Study Date of [**2167-11-6**] DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a diagnosis of anti-K antibody at outside hospital which was confirmed at [**Hospital1 18**].
EGD [**2167-11-5**]: Small hiatal hernia No bleeding site noted Previous duodenal resection with end to side anastomosis of the distal bulb Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Abdominal Xray [**2167-11-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
If there is no prior imaging through this area, then a CT scan would be recommended for further assessment.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis w/contrast [**2167-11-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Chest (PA & LAT) [**2167-11-7**]: The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.
GI Bleed: Pt initially presented with melena and was found to have Hct of 18.
He was transfused a total of 4 units in the ICU and Hct thereafter remained stable at 27-29.
The GI team subsequently performed a small bowel capsule study that also did not reveal any site of intra-abdominal bleeding.
Pt did not complain of further episodes of melena during hospital admission and was monitored on telemetry without any significant events.
Abdominal x-ray was performed that did not show obstruction.
A CT abdomen revealed old changes from his prior surgery but no acute intra-abdominal process.
A CXR and UA was also negative for any source of infection.
Urine culture and two sets of blood cultures were negative.
(Of note, two sets of blood cultures were still pending on discharge.)
WBC decreased from 13 at time of fevers to 5 by time of discharge.
Fevers, abdominal pain, and obstipation resolved and he was transitioned to po cipro and flagyl.
CT Findings: A CT abdomen was performed to evaluate for intra-abdominal process that could be causing pt's fevers and abdominal pain.
The CT was negative for acute processes but revealed several incidental findings that pt confirmed were due to his prior bowel surgery.
He was also noted to have a proximal femoral lesion suspicious for fibrous dysplasia which per patient was due to a bone biopsy he had had in the past.

Your blood counts rose with the transfusion and you were transferred to the general medicine floor where you complained of abdominal pain and were found to have a fever.
An x-ray of the abdomen and a CT scan of the abdomen did not show any acute process.
For work-up of your dark stools, an EGD was performed that was unremarkable.
You also underwent a small bowel capsule study that also did not reveal any significant findings.
