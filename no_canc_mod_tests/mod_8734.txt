Admission Date:  [**2107-6-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2107-7-5**]   Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, and subdural hematoma diagnosed in [**2104-6-24**].
The CT scan showed minimal change in the patient's known subdural hematoma.
Chest x-ray, however, showed bilateral consolidation, with gram positive cocci in the sputum.
He further required the addition of Neo-Synephrine to support his blood pressure.
His heart rate subsequently increased and his ST-T wave changes worsened, so his Dopamine was stopped and these changes resolved.
The patient was subsequently seen by cardiology in the Emergency Room and an echocardiogram was done, and his ischemia was felt to be consistent with demand ischemia.
Congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction 20% to 25%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 101.8, heart rate 80 to 110s, respiratory rate 24 to 28 and oxygen saturation 97% on nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Extraocular movements intact, pupils post surgical bilaterally, anicteric sclerae.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count 9.2, hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 177,000, INR 1.5, partial thromboplastin time 33.3, sodium 136, potassium 4.6, chloride 92, bicarbonate 26, BUN 48, creatinine 6.4, glucose 147, most recent white blood cell count 8.2.
CKs have been trending down, last CK was 38 on [**2107-7-4**], previous CKs 104, 74, and 72.
Vancomycin level from today was 16.1.
Sputum from [**2107-6-29**] showed greater than 25 polymorphonuclear neutrophils and 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
Blood cultures from [**2107-6-30**] ....... and [**2107-6-29**] show no growth to date.
Chest x-ray from [**2107-6-30**] showed bibasilar consolidation, no congestive heart failure.
The CT scan from [**2107-6-29**] showed a subacute subdural hematoma, left lateral, slightly increased since [**2104-11-10**] but no herniation and no acute hemorrhage.
Echocardiogram done in the Emergency Room showed inferior, inferolateral hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% to 25% with 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, systolic pressures of 38.
His white blood cell count has remained stable and he has remained afebrile.
The plan is to continue antibiotics for a 12 day course of levofloxacin and vancomycin for a chest x-ray with bibasilar consolidation and a sputum culture positive for gram positive cocci in pairs in clusters.
His blood pressure has remained stable over the course of today in addition to his challenge with hemodialysis today.
An echocardiogram done in the Emergency Room, ischemia thought to be secondary to demand ischemia.
CKs were cycled and were trending down.
The patient was carefully bolused to maintain his blood pressure due to the fact that he is at extreme risk for congestive heart failure.
Pneumonia:  The patient had bibasilar consolidations on chest x-ray, with sputum culture positive for 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
dosed for a vancomycin level less than 15 until [**2107-7-12**].
