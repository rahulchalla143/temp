FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):  Imaging: [**5-18**] CXRay: IMPRESSION:  Nearly complete opacification of the left hemithorax with balanced mass effect, suggesting a large pleural effusion among other potential causes, including the possibility of malignancy.
Chest CT may be useful to evaluate further if clinically indicated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
[**5-19**] CXRay s/p chest tube: New left basal pigtail pleural drain has cleared virtually all the previous large left pleural effusion.
An ABG revealed hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis.
A trial of BIPAP was not successful, and the patient required (after discussion with his court appointed guardian).
Other than urine, potential sources included lung, which is unlikely in retrospect given the lack of consolidation on xray after pleural fluid tap and the non-infectious nature of the fluid itself, and stage IV sacral decubitus.
An echo revealed good EF, ruling out cardiogenic shock.
