An albuterol inhaler did not help, so she went to the [**Hospital1 1774**] ED.
Her BP was initially 104/67, HR 55, RR13.
CXR showed R pleural effusion.
BNP was 1500, cardiac enzymes negative.
HCT was noted to be 24.9 (baseline 24-27).
At 6am her blood pressures dropped to 83/44 and she was given a 125cc NS bolus.
ABG on bipap was 7.34/60/313/32.
Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 13475**] due to lower GI bleed and HCT of 17.
She required 6 units PRBCs that admission and bleeding was felt to be due to lower GI angioectasia; colonoscopy was not done due to recent scope [**1-30**] which showed many angioectasias throughout the colon.
HCT was stable at 24.7 on discharge and most recent HCT [**3-26**] was 27.4.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2109-2-26**] and multiple priors.
SINGLE PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: In comparison to the most recent chest radiograph as well as the recent CT, there has been an increase in a right pleural effusion.
Lung volumes are low, accentuating the heart size, but even allowing for technique very stable moderate cardiomegaly.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right subclavian catheter that extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-2-26**], there is no significant change.
COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to CT from [**2109-2-27**] and renal ultrasound from [**2109-2-25**].
[**2109-4-4**]: CHEST RADIOGRAPH  INDICATION: Chronic heart failure, shortness of breath, evaluation for interval change.
She appeared fluid overloaded clinically and on CXR with a BNP of 6666.
She had no chest pain to suggest ACS; EKG was at her baseline and 2 sets of cardiac enzymes were negative.
Her admission weight was 87.6 kg and her maximum weight during admission prior to CVVH was 92 kg.
Her hematocrit did show a slight drop but blood loss and hypovolemia were not felt to be contributing to her hypotension.
Her hematocrit was monitored closely and she was transfused two units of packed red blood cells (one on [**2109-4-3**] and one on [**2109-4-4**]) with an appropriate increase in her hematocrit from 22.9 to 29.8.
# Acute renal failure: The patient was found to have BUN 100 and Cr 2.5 (baseline 1.7).
Creatinine began trending down as patient started on CVVH.
Medications were dosed for the patient's creatinine clearance, and the patient was followed by the renal consult team; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**], the patient's nephrologist, saw her while in-house.
Her admission weight was 87.6 kg and her maximum weight during admission prior to CVVH was 92 kg.
Abdominal exam was benign and the patient was given zofran as needed.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
