Neurology consultation concluded that he had a toxic metabolic encephalopathy as the workup included negative toxicology screen, lumbar puncture and electroencephalogram.
Swallow study was done for aspiration which was normal.
Head CT was also negative as well as a CT of the spine.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed cirrhosis.
On [**2195-11-5**], the patient was found to have a distended acute abdomen with an abdominal CT that showed portal venous air and the patient was taken emergently to the operating room where he was found to have toxic megacolon.
The pathology showed pseudomembranous focal hemorrhage as well as wall thickening and patchy ulceration which suggested ischemia and possibly infectious etiologies, although the findings seem to correlate with a vascular pattern.
The pathology was not thought to be consistent with inflammatory bowel disease.
His oxygen saturation was 79% with a blood pressure of 88/60.
In the Emergency Department, his blood pressure was 60/42, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 98% with a nasogastric lavage that was occult blood positive but negative for coffee grounds.
In the Intensive Care Unit, he grew four out of four blood culture bottles positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram in the Intensive Care Unit that was negative.
Hepatitis C. 4.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature of 98.7 with a pulse of 105, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 115/60 and oxygen saturation 100% while intubated.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination revealed pale conjunctiva.
Cardiac examination revealed regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The chest examination revealed lungs that had decreased breath sounds on the left and clear to auscultation on the right.
Abdominal examination revealed a softly distended abdomen with some discomfort to palpation and no clear distribution.
Extremity examination revealed warm and well perfused extremities with no edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 16.1, with a hematocrit of 26.0 and platelets of 307,000.
Urinalysis was negative.
The patient had a Chem7 with a potassium of 5.4, blood urea nitrogen 148, creatinine 8.0.
ALT was 147, AST 55, alkaline phosphatase 141, total bilirubin 0.8.
Initial CK was 58.
Amylase was 301 with a lipase of 402.
Arterial blood gases on admission revealed pH 7.30/25/133.
Chest x-ray with left linear atelectasis versus infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 83 beats per minute with normal axis and intervals.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 50 year old man with a history of polysubstance abuse, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, question of schizophrenia, restrictive lung disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presented in septic shock with four out of four blood culture bottles positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus but no documented source.
There was question of recurrent aspiration although the chest x-ray did not appear to impressively suggest that.
A speech and swallow evaluation was done and video swallow test showed that the patient does not aspirate.
Repeated chest x-rays showed bilateral basilar opacities which were thought to be aspiration pneumonia.
A transthoracic echocardiogram done in the Medical Intensive Care Unit showed no evidence of vegetation, however, was of suboptimal image quality.
The patient eventually had a transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed a 4.0 millimeter vegetation on the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve.
Vancomycin levels were within therapeutic range.
Other sources of the positive blood cultures included abdominal source since the patient had recently undergo in-hospital abdominal surgery.
An abdominal ultrasound and renal ultrasound revealed no evidence of abscess or dilated ducts.
An HIV test was pursued and was found to be negative.
The patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy before the transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out upper gastrointestinal source of bleeding.
An abdominal CT was pursued which revealed small pleural effusions and nonobstructing clot in the SMV.
HCV PCR revealed nondetectable viral load.
Because the patient had persistent tenderness over his lower back including L4-L5 and L5-S1, a magnetic resonance scan was done of the back which revealed subtle T11 to T12 increase intensity on the T2 images.
Further evaluation with bone scan was considered.
The patient had wound cultures sent from his abdominal wound which showed moderate growth, coagulase positive Staphylococcus.
Repeated chest x-rays showed persistent bibasilar opacities consistent with aspiration.
CT surgery recommended evaluating the patient for lower extremity sources of emboli.
Lower extremity ultrasound was negative bilaterally for deep vein thrombosis.
Cardiovascular - The patient with transesophageal echocardiogram revealing a 4.0 millimeter vegetation and a patent foramen ovale.
The patient was only found to have 2+ aortic insufficiency on transesophageal echocardiogram and no evidence of valve damage or paravalvular abscess.
Renal - The patient was found to have acute renal failure upon presentation and upon examination of the urine was found to have coarse muddy brown casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis.
His hematocrit was found to be stable as well.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed before the transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed grade I varices.
The patient was quickly started on proton pump inhibitor and Propanolol which was titrated to keep his pulse below 60.
