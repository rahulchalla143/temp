ECHO Study Date of [**2187-5-10**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Cardiac Catheterization Study Date of [**2187-5-10**]  : 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 17 mmHg, mean PCW 22 mmHg).
Significant blunting of the Y-descent on the right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure hemodynamic tracings was noted.
Pulmonary artery pressure was minimally elevated (mean PA 21 mmHg).
Systemic arterial pressures were normal with a 10 mmHg respirophasic variation in systolic pressure (borderline pulsus paradoxus).
Cardiac index was normal at 2.9 L/min/m2.
Upon entry of the pericardial catheter into the pericardial space, mean pericardial pressure was 19 mmHg, slightly greater than measured right atrial pressure (mean 17 mmHg).
Mean pericardial pressure decreased to 11 mmHg with respirophasic variation and inspiratory pressures near zero.
Cardiac index increased to 3.8 L/min/m2.
Cardiac echo performed in the cath lab after drainage showed a very small residual pericardial effusion.
Although patient initially had no obvious pulsus paradoxus at the time of admission, approximately 6 hours later on hospital day one, patient had a pulsus of approximately 15mm, which was confirmed later that morning by echocardiogram (sustained RV diastolic collapse) and right heart catherization (equalization of pressures, respiratory variation, and pericardial pressures 17-20mmHg).
Prior to removal of drain, echocardiogram revealed no signs of tamponade, but a continued small residual echodense pericardial effusion.
In pursuit of etiology of effusion, a PPD was placed (flat @ 48 hours), AFB stain of fluid was negative, and no organisms were seen.
Furthermore, given no further symptoms of pericardial constriction, it was felt that further workup for pericardial constriction was unnecessary at this time.
Furthermore, pulsus continued to remain at 6mmHg making recurrence of effusion unlikely.
Patient was discharged with instructions to return for echocardiogram within one week of discharge, to see PCP in followup for chemistries and CBC (while on indomethacin) within one week, and to return to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in cardiology within two weeks to review echocardiogram results.
Call to schedule an echocardiogram at [**Hospital3 **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 128**] for Thursday [**2187-5-17**].
She will review your echocardiogram results with you at that time.
You will need to have your CBC and Chem 7 drawn to follow your blood count and creatinine while on indomethacin.
