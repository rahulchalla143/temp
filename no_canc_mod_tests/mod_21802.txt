Prenatal screens were maternal blood type O positive, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune.
This was an IVF twin pregnancy complicated by cervical shortening, with mother on bed rest since [**9-26**], subchorionic hemorrhage on twin 1, and ventriculomegaly with 2 vessel umbilical cord on twin 2.
MRI subsequently showed diffuse moderate ventriculomegaly and irregularity of the ventricular walls, possibly associated with hemorrhage as well as possible inferior vermian hypoplasia.
Amniocentesis was declined.
His Apgars were 7 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes of life.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, birth weight 1310 gm, 50th to 70th percentile, length 41 cm, 75th percentile, head circumference 29.5 cm, 75th to 90th percentile.
In general, baby boy [**Name (NI) **] number 2 had an examination consistent with a 28 weeks gestational age.
His HEENT examination was significant for microcephaly with anterior fontanelle that was full but soft and mild splaying of the sutures.
His chest examination revealed intermittent grunting respirations with moderate intercostal retractions and fair breath sounds bilaterally with scattered coarse crackles.
His heart was regular rate and rhythm without a murmur, his femoral pulses were normal, and his capillary refill time was 3 seconds.
Abdominal examination revealed a soft, nondistended abdomen with liver 2 cm below the right costal margin, no splenomegaly, no masses, active bowel sounds, a 2 vessel umbilical cord, and a patent anus.
GU examination revealed normal preterm male external genitalia with testes undescended bilaterally.
Neurologic examination showed an active male responsive to stimulation with decreased tone symmetrically, but moving all extremities with an intact gag and grasp reflex.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Initially baby boy [**Name (NI) **] was held NPO on Starter PN and D10W at total fluids of 100 cc per kg per day.
Hematology:  Initial hematocrit was 42.6 percent with platelets of 162,000.
Baby boy [**Known lastname **] developed hyperbilirubinemia with a maximum bilirubin of 5.5 on day of life 6.
Most recent hematocrit on [**11-28**] was 27.7 percent.
Infectious disease:  In light of his prematurity and unknown GBS status, CBC and blood culture were sent on admission and baby boy [**Name (NI) **] was begun on ampicillin and gentamicin.
Initial white blood count was 16,000 with 65 percent polys and 2 percent bands.
Blood cultures were negative at 48 hours so antibiotics were discontinued.
Neurology:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] antenatally diagnosed hydrocephalus was evaluated with head ultrasound on day of life 1.
MRI was obtained on the same day, which confirmed the findings of the head ultrasound, but did not delineate between aqueductal stenosis and cerebral dysgenesis.
Neurology recommended close followup with head ultrasounds and daily head circumferences.
Head circumference at birth was 29.5 cm, but this declined to 28.5 cm the following day.
Head ultrasound on day of life 11 showed increase in the ventricular size.
Baby boy [**Known lastname **] head circumference has continued to increase with a recent increase of 3.25 cm over the past 1 week.
He underwent a non-contrast head CT on [**11-27**] with the final [**Location (un) 1131**] pending at this time.
Genetics also recommended a renal ultrasound which was performed and was normal.
