Upon arrival to the Emergency Department, his oxygen saturation was 97 percent on three liters oxygen.
He also denies increase in the severity of his cough from baseline, chest pain, pleuritic chest pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, bright red blood per rectum, abdominal pain, dysuria, fever, chills, night sweats or unexplained loss of weight.
His baseline chest x-ray shows an interstitial pattern with a patchy infiltrate on the left lower lobe.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is significant for restrictive lung disease with his last pulmonary function test on [**2106-2-5**] with an FEV1 of 0.92 liters, 36 percent of predicted and an FVC of 1.5 liters which is 36 percent of predicted.
His TLC is 40 percent of predicted, and DLCO 15 percent of predicted as reported on [**2105-10-21**].
His oxygen saturations tend to run approximately 91 percent in room air.
The patient had an electrocardiogram in [**1-/2106**] which showed a right ventricular dilation.
He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea which was confirmed by a sleep study prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature on admission was 99.3, blood pressure 104/77, pulse 104, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 97 percent on three liters oxygen nasal cannula.
HEENT exam revealed pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear, moist mucous membranes.
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm, slightly tachycardiac, normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
His extremities had evidence of chronic stasis dermatitis, no edema or cyanosis, and his neurological exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, his white count was 6.4, hematocrit 34.9, platelets 240.
Sodium 144, potassium 5.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate 33, BUN 38, creatinine 1.4, glucose 91, CK 242, MB 7, troponin of less than 0.3, ALT 102, AST 53, alkaline phosphatase 376, total bilirubin 0.3, theophylline 4.6.
His urinalysis was unremarkable.
Chest x-ray shows slight left ventricular enlargement, right pleural effusion, and a lower lobe infiltrate possibly consistent with consolidation.
His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 109 beats per minute with a normal axis and some new T wave inversions changed from prior electrocardiogram in leads V2-V4.
He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea confirmed by a sleep study as well as both severe restrictive lung disease of unknown etiology and asthma.
At the time of his initial presentation, the patient had an oxygen saturation in the high 90s and described his breathing as comfortable.
He was scheduled for a muscle biopsy to further evaluate his possible neuromuscular disease, but the patient had become increasingly psychotic by that time and was unable to consent for the procedure.
His electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department, however, did show some evidence of right heart strain as well as some T wave inversions in leads V2-V4 that were not present on a prior electrocardiogram.
He was ruled out for myocardial infarction with multiple enzymes which were notable, however, for the fact that his CKs were elevated, although his MB fractions were quite low, again indicating possible chronic myositis.
His electrocardiogram was rechecked several times and was stable without any changes from the electrocardiogram done in the Emergency Department.
He had a transthoracic echocardiogram done during admission which showed an ejection fraction of 65 percent.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained which showed no evidence of gallstones or biliary obstruction but did show mildly dilated common bile duct.
If his liver function tests remain elevated in the future, he can get an MRCP as an outpatient.
A head CT was done which showed no evidence of intracranial pathology.
His Zyprexa was decreased to 7.5 mg q.6:00 p.m., down from 15 mg p.o.
He began to refuse his BI-PAP again at night and became very distrustful at times alternating with times when he would not want to be left alone.
His potassium remained stable throughout the rest of his hospital course.
PROBLEM #6:  Renal:  His creatinine was 1.4 on admission which was increased over baseline of 1.0, but it returned to baseline of 1.0 with good oral intake of fluids during his hospital course.
