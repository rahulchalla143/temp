Her oxygen saturation was found to be 77% on room air and increased to 88% with 2 or 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.
In the Emergency Department, a head CT demonstrated a moderate sized subacute to chronic-appearing infarct of the left parietal lobe, fairly prominent supratentorial hydrocephalus, somewhat nodular-appearing LMCA, and considerable thickening within the anterior aspect of the left nasal cavity.
A chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion, so the patient was given Furosemide 40 mg IV.
Following diuresis, her respiratory rate decreased, and her oxygen saturation improved to the mid 90s on 6 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.
She was subsequently given Metoprolol 5 mg IV for a blood pressure of 181/106; she also received 1 in of Nitropaste and an Aspirin.
?, heart rate 80, blood pressure 185/110, respirations 48, oxygen saturation 97% on 50% face.
Heart:  Heart rate was irregular, and there were very distant heart sounds.
LABORATORY DATA:  On initial laboratory evaluation, white count was 12.4, hematocrit 47.3, platelet count 196,000, white count differential demonstrated 89.9 segs, no bands, 6.4 lymphs, 3 monocytes, 0.2 eosinophils, 0.5 basophils; PT 21.3, PTT 30.9, INR 3.0; initial serum chemistries demonstrated a sodium of 144, potassium 3.5, chloride 103, bicarb 25, BUN 22, creatinine 1.1, glucose 202; initial CK was 115, MB fraction 5, troponin 0.5; initial urinalysis demonstrated large blood, greater than 300 protein, [**4-27**] red cells, [**1-20**] white cells, many bacteria, no yeast, 0-2 epithelial cells.
Chest x-ray and head CT were as noted above.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial fibrillation versus atrial flutter at 70 beats per minute, slight right axis, normal QRS and QT intervals, Q-waves in leads AVL and V1, and no ST segment or T-wave changes.
Although she appeared to have an element of pulmonary edema on her chest x-ray, she did not have a diuretic response to Furosemide, and she remained in respiratory distress.
Given her persistent respiratory distress, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring and treatment.
On transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was found to be in hypercapnic respiratory failure, and a repeat chest x-ray demonstrated a left-sided infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, and echocardiogram was done that demonstrated an ejection fraction of 70%, small left ventricle, RVHK, left ventricular hypertrophy, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Of note, she also ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.
Given her subacute stroke, a cholesterol panel was sent that demonstrated a cholesterol of 179, triglycerides of 129, HDL 34, and LDL of 119.
Her LFTs were normal, and the patient was subsequently started on Atorvastatin.
Given her impaired neurologic status, a swallowing evaluation was done.
On transfer, she continued to breath at a respiratory rate of 40 but appeared clinically comfortable.
Her blood pressure remained elevated ranging between 160-190 systolic throughout her time on the Medicine Floor; therefore, her blood pressure medications were titrated up as noted below.
Of note, the patient was found to have MRSA in her sputum from a sputum culture sent while she was in the Intensive Care Unit.
wheezing, Ipratropium 2 puffs q.i.d., Captopril 75 mg p.o.
