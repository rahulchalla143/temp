# CXR [**2185-10-11**] 7:06 PM IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2185-10-11**] 6:49 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Please note an MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of acute ischemia.
# CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2185-10-11**] 6:49 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited examination due to technical artifacts as described above.
Echo [**2185-10-12**] Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
# Ct head [**2185-10-13**] FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated.
The ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses are largely opacified and air-fluid levels and mucosal thickening are present among the maxillary sinuses.
-CK/Trop: anticipate elevation was [**1-28**] CPR, trended downwards - Echo was normal -serial neurologic exam showed little change -evidence for end organ perfusion problems from elevated lactate.
Neuro consulted and EEG showed that pt did have some seizure activity, which resolved with propofol.
-Head CT consistent with diffuse anoxic brain damage, and incompatable with consciousness.
At that time, the ET tube was removed and pt expired at 4:23 am  # Communication: [**Doctor First Name 2127**] [**Doctor First Name 74664**], home [**Telephone/Fax (1) 74665**]; [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 74664**] ([**Name (NI) 74666**] daughter-in-law), cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 74667**].
