He presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] where an initial NIHSS was 7.
Formal strength testing was difficult to assess, but appears to have full strength and symmetric grossly throughout.

[**9-29**] CTA head and neck: 1.
7 x 4.8 cm left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage without significant change in size since the prior exam performed 4:30 hs before.
Lung cancer (with hemorrhage) cannot be completely excluded and conparison with prior outside studies to evaluate chronicity would be most helpful.
Absence of the right kidney and multiple simple cysts in the left kidney.
Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis  [**9-30**] CT head - Overall, similar dimensions of heterogenous left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with slightly increased surrounding vasogenic edema and sulcal effacement.
[**10-1**] Ct head - Overall similar dimensions of the heterogeneous left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with increased edema since the [**2195-9-29**] study and increased mild effacement of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1833**] was admitted to the ICU on the neurosurgery service for Q1 hour neurochecks and SBP control less than 140 in the setting of ICH.
MRI Brain with and without gadolinium demonstrated underlying mass.
CT Torso demonstrated no evidence of primary malignancy.
He had an episode of agitation overnight but CT was stable.
Post op Head CT revealed post op changes with residual left frontal ICH.
?You will need an MRI of the brain with gadolinium contrast.
