Her oxygen saturations at the nursing home were in the 50's.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency room, her oxygen saturation was measured to be in the 80's and she clearly audible wheezing.
At time of transfer, her systolic blood pressure was in the 90's.
Her heart rate was 100-120, and her respiratory rate was 25.
Coronary artery disease, s/p MI, s/p 4 stents placed [**Month (only) 205**]  [**2111**] at [**Hospital1 2025**]  2.
CHF, systolic and diastolic dysfunction (Cardiologist -  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10302**], MD)  3.
Depression  14. h/o UTIs ([**3-/2113**] admission for MDR E. coli infection)  15. h/o Stool impaction  16. splenic/hepatic nodules, per CT  17. h/o PNA ([**1-/2113**] admission)  18.
Pertinent Results: [**2113-10-27**]: EKG Sinus tachycardia.
[**2113-10-30**] Chest X-ray: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-22**] through [**10-30**], 3:54 a.m.: Mild edema has developed in the right lower lung.
This was consistent with a BNP of >70,000 and her edematous state.
Her CK and CK-MB remained within normal limits.
After the patient's blood pressure stabalized based on arterial line tracings, diuresis was initiated with a lasix drip for her congestive heart failure.
A TSH and cortisol were within normal limits.
#) Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure: Based on the patient's clinical exam, imaging, and laboratories (BNP >70,000), it was felt that an exacerbation of the patient's congestive heart failure contributed the decompensation in her respiratory status.
Patient had a recent echocardiogram during her last hospital stay.
Her CK remained flat, and her troponins were stable, mildly elevated in the setting of renal insufficiency.
#) Coagulopathy: It was unclear why the patient's PT, PTT, and INR were all elevated.
A fibrinogen level was within normal limits, and FDP was 10-40.
Beta-blocker was given for rate control as permitted by her blood pressure.
#) Hypotension: Patient was noted to be hypotensive with systolic pressure in the 70's upon arrival to floor from the emergency department.
A cortisol level indicated an appropriate response to stress.
An arterial line was placed, and higher blood pressures (systolic in the 90's) were noted as compared to the mannual cuff.
On the evening of [**2113-10-30**] at about 7:30 PM, patient was noted to have repeated transient episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressure down to the 60's, that would resolve without intervention.
Around the same time, she was noted to have episodes of tachycardia to the 150's that did not correlate with drop in blood pressure, and was mildly tachypneic.
A STAT chest x-ray, arterial blood gas, EKG, cardiac enzymes, HCT, and set of electrolytes were checked for further evaluation.
The above work-up was notable for a lactate level of 7.4, up from 2.9 earlier the same morning.
Her lactate trended down to 5.4, with improvement in her tachycardia and blood pressure.
Cardiac enzymes, EKG, and exam were all relatively unchanged, aside from cool extremities that were similar to time of admission.
At approximately 11:30 PM on [**2113-10-30**], patient's blood pressure again began to decline, and levophed was started to maintain a MAP above 65.
Depsite these interventions, the patient's blood pressure continued to decline.
