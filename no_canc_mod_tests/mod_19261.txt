Echo from OSH reveals severe septal hypertrophy, mitral stenosis (peak 10, mean 5) mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], EF > 75%, RVH, Peak LVOT gradient 14mmHg, mean 9, no evidence [**Male First Name (un) **].
His echo was significant for a lack of apparent LV outflow tract obstruction/gradient, and his response to blood pressure medications did not indicate that this was a significant issue.
His heart rate was in the low 60s on discharge.
He was also started on coumadin, after his hematocrit was determined to be stable (see below), and can have his INR followed as an OP.
* RENAL: Pt exposed to large dye load (500cc) during the cath, and there was a concern for dye nephropathy; however, his creatinine remained stable throughout.
His stool was brown (not melanic or BRBPR), but was guaiac positive.
An NGT lavage was clear with no blood or bile.
He should have a GI workup for this as an outpatient.
Neuro exam only notable for L facial droop.
You will need to have your blood pressure checked on your new medication regimen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16004**] should also draw your blood to check your INR after restarting your coumadin.
You should also have your liver enzymes, thyroid function tests and pulmonary function tests monitored over time.
