There she was found to be in congestive heart failure and a blood sugar to be 600.
Electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed ST depressions in I and aVL, and ST elevations in V1 and V2.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on the [**1-27**] for cardiac catheterization.
Subsequently, she became hypotensive in the Cardiac Catheterization Waiting Room, and developed new ST elevations.
During the procedure, the patient developed cardiogenic shock and bradycardic at that point, and intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted, and she was started on dopamine drip.
She was then brought back to the CCU for further blood pressure support, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiration ventilation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon arrival in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, the patient has the following vital signs: Temperature 97.8, blood pressure 111/68, heart rate 107 irregular.
She was on vent settings of AC 600, 16, and 100% with PEEP of 5.
Her arterial blood gas was 7.33, 22, and 426.
On catheterization #2, she had the right intra-aortic balloon pump discontinued and one placed on her left.
She had the following laboratory values:  Her white blood cell count was 15.9, rose to 20 on her return to the CCU.
Her hematocrit is 28.4, platelets of 210.
PT 13.7, PTT 24.4, INR of 1.2.
Her urinalysis showed large blood, trace protein, traced ketones, and 6 red blood cells.
Her anion gap is 29.
CHEM-7:  Sodium 129, potassium 5.3, chloride 94, bicarb 11, BUN 71, and creatinine 2.2 with a glucose of 478.
Her CKs went from 299 to 290 to 260 to 437.
Her CK MB from 6 to 7 to 6 and to 15, and her troponin was 9.3, 7.1, 22.8.
Her CKs from 437, to 80, 91, to 1145, and MB from 15 to 28 to 21.
She had a peak lactate of 3.1, and CK peaked at 229, MB of 42, and troponin of 33.5.
She had an albumin of 2.2.
She had sputum sample from the 8th with greater than 25 PMN's, less than 10 epi's, and 2+ yeast, but all cultures including urine and blood cultures have been negative.
She had a chest x-ray on the 8th, which showed mild congestive heart failure.
She had an echocardiogram which showed a mildly dilated left atrium, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, an ejection fraction of roughly 25%, and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Of note, over the course of the subsequent two days, the patient's platelet count went from 117 to 96 to 78 down to 49.
She had an ALT of 54, an AST of 76.
Her electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 120, normal axis, and left bundle pattern upon arrival.
The intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued on [**1-31**], and the patient defended her blood pressure well off the balloon pump and the pressors were gradually weaned off.
Initially of interest, the patient was started on dopamine to which she had a correspondence in regards to a low SVR and she was switched to Neo-Synephrine which had a better response in maintaining her blood pressure more adequately.
She is to be treated with Plavix, and aspirin, and statin, and beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor when her blood pressure is tolerated.
The Vascular Surgery team also recommended anticoagulating the patient with Heparin and Coumadin to preserve blood flow to the lower extremities to prevent further thrombosis.
