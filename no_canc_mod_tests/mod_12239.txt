The patient also was hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   His blood pressure was 165/58; pulse of 36 beats per minute; 02 saturation was 93% on two liters.
Jugular venous pressure of 10 plus centimeters.
His troponin was less than 0.3 on the first and peaked at 1.5.
The patient also was tested for digoxin and had zero and his TSH was tested and came out 2.1.
The patient's white blood cell count was 13.4, his hematocrit was 38.2 and his platelets were 182.
Neutrophils were 74%, lymphocytes 17%, monos 5%.
PT was 12.9, PTT 26, INR 1.2.
His electrolytes were sodium of 146, potassium 4.0, chloride 109, bicarbonate 25, BUN 23, creatinine 1.6, glucose 105.
Calcium was 9.5, magnesium 2.0, phosphate 4.5.
His EKG on admission was sinus rhythm, rate of 90, A to Z dissociation and junctional escape rhythm.
His chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure and no signs of infiltrate.
He initially was scheduled for permanent pacemaker placement on [**8-2**], however, the patient spiked and temperature and the pacemaker placement was postponed pending further work-up for infection.
Chest x-ray revealed leads in the appropriate position with no signs of pneumothorax or bleeding.
His ACE inhibitor was later switched to Lisinopril, initially 20 mg, however, his blood pressure started to become elevated.
An echocardiogram performed early in the hospital course showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, systolic function moderately depressed with an ejection fraction of 35%, posterior hypokinesis, aortic moderate dilation, aortic valve moderately thickened, one plus aortic regurgitation.
The results from this echocardiogram with the fact that his CPKs and troponins remained stable, and findings on EKG, suggested that the patient did not have chronically active coronary artery disease, however, he was started on aspirin prophylactically for ischemia.
The patient may deserve further work-up for coronary artery disease as an outpatient, where he may be restarted on Lipitor if deemed appropriate.
Chronically, he often was tachypneic and had oxygen saturations in the mid to low 90's.
Infectious Disease:  During the course of his admission, the patient spiked a temperature of 101.2 F.; his white blood cell count climbed to as high as 13.9.
He was pan-cultured with blood cultures and urine cultures showing no growth as final [**Location (un) 1131**].
Chest x-ray showed no signs of pneumonia, however, Infectious Disease suggested started the patient on antibiotics prophylactically to avoid possible infection during pacemaker placement.
Renal:  During the course of his admission, his BUN and creatinine remained stable.
On the day prior discharge, his BUN and creatinine was 28/1.3.
His electrolytes had been monitored and were repleted as necessary.
His lipid panel came back with a triglyceride of 95, HDL of 37, LDL of 123.
His ALT was 28 and AST was 25.
Hematologic:  During the course of his admission, his hematocrit remained stable.
