She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for futher evaluation and management.
Her daughter was present at bedside after initial evaluation and was able to provide some history regarding baseline status.
Family History: Unable to obtain from patient  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission:  Vitals: T: 97.7 P: 63 R: 14  BP: 131/53  General: Awake, NAD.
Sensory: 0 9.
Language: 2 10.
Dysarthria: 1 11.
Inattentive- able to name [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] forwards up until [**Month (only) 116**] and then got stuck and was unable to proceed.
Formal strength testing difficult due to inattention, but from what she was able to participate in, strength appeared full and symmetric bilaterally, including at deltoids, biceps, triceps, FE, IP and hams.
Sensory: No deficits to light touch or noxious (pinching).
Gait: deferred  =====================================  Physical Exam on Discharge: VS: T 98.6, BP 120/60, HR 70, RR 18, 96% on RA GEN: elderly woman sitting in chair, in NAD HEENT: MMM CV: RRR PULM: CTA-B ABD: soft, NT, ND EXT: no edema  NEURO: MS - doesn't know what she ate for breakfast, family reports that she is back to baseline CN - very mild R facial droop, EOMI MOTOR - 5/5 strength throughout SENSORY - intact to LT throughout COORDINATION - can reach for examiner's hands bilaterally GAIT - deferred   Pertinent Results: From OSH: WBC 8.4 Hb 12.7 HCT 37.8 Plt 257 Na 140 K 4.3 Cl 104 CO2 28 BUN 26 Cr 1.7 Glu 103  EKG: NSR @60, no ST changes  Radiologic Data:  NCHCT: no acute changes noted; there is diffuse cortical atrophy.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CTA [**2194-12-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2194-12-11**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
MRI [**2194-12-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
NIHSS unknown on arrival but tPA was given at 10:52 PM and she was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
# Neuro: She was maintained on close neuro and BP checks following tPA.
Her home antihypertensives were held and BP was allowed to autoregulate with goal SBP 140-180 with hydralazine prn SBP > 180.
MRI on [**12-11**] showed no evidence of vascular infarction, specifically in left MCA distribution but multiple small areas of slow diffusion, with associated ADC change, too small to accurately characterize; scattered throughout the right parietal and left temporal lobes, likely related to embolic infarction as well as severe changes related to the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
# CVS: Blood pressure was closely controlled as above.
EKG showed sinus rythym with atrial premature beats.
Cardiac markers were negative and echo was unremarkable with an EF of 55%.
Her LDL was 151 so she was started on simvastatin as above.
TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES Patient will need her Cr monitored to ensure that it continues to decrease.
