[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2100-8-25**], findings are similar.
