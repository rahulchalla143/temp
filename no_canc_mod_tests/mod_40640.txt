Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Venous Catheter placement Arterial Line placement IVC filter placement  History of Present Illness: This is a 51-year-old female status-post recent bilateral breast reduction surgery complicated by infection status-post recent discharge from OSH for chest pain presented to OSH in PEA arrest with PE on CT scan status-post thrombolytics.
Patient was recently admitted and discharged day prior to admission from [**Location (un) 745**]-Wellesly for left sided chest pain, which was attributed to neuropathic post surgical pain.
She was intubated in the ED with gases showing pH 6.80, pCO2 77, pO2 243.
A CTA was performed, which showed a large PE.
Her labs were noted to be remarkable for a +d-dimer, elevated Creatinine 1.4, trans.
ABG showing acidosis of 6.80 likely mixed given CO2 of 77, CO2 17.
Prior to her transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] vital signs were 90/50 on 20 of Levophed, HR 120, RR 20-25 intubated, Sat 100%.
CXR [**1-24**]: 1.
If echocardiography is not revealing, further evaluation with chest CT is recommended.
INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained.
A left lateral view of the pelvis was not obtained secondary to lack of patient cooperation.
Blood flow images show no areas of abnormal tracer activity.Dynamic blood pool images show increased tracer activity within the first 90 minutes in the region of the pelvis, overlying the left iliac vessels and progressing more centrally and inferiorly within the pelvis, likely corresponding to the sigmoid colon or rectum.
LENIs [**2129-2-8**]: BILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and Doppler images of the bilateral internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation.
PT: 22.5  PTT: 89.7  INR: 2.1   Brief Hospital Course: Middle Aged Female status-post recent bilateral breast reduction c/b infection s/p recent discharge for MSK chest pain p/w PEA arrest s/p multiple cycles of Atropine/Epi likely [**3-1**] PE s/p thrombolytics on pressors, intubated, heparin gtt.
OBSTRUCTIVE CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Cariogenic shock likely secondary to clot burden, as CT scan showed PE with RV dilatation.
TTE performed showed areas of hypokinesis, dilated RV with LV systolic function intact.
Pressors were slowly weaned, and patient maintained her own blood pressures.
She was monitored on telemetry without further incidence thereafter.
LARGE PE STATUS-POST THROMBOLYTICS: Patient noted to have a large PE on CT scan likely [**3-1**] immobile status s/p surgery with poor wound healing followed by cervical disc herniation where she was immobile.
She is discharged with an INR of 2.1 after 48hrs.
She was also discharged with lovenox to take if her INR is <2.
She was monitored on telemetry without further incident.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
CT of abdomen/pelvis and left thigh (patient had an ecchymosis in this area) were unrevealing for source of bleeding.
A bleeding scan [**2129-1-29**] showed questionable upper GI bleeding.
Another scan [**2129-1-30**] showed definite sigmoid/rectal bleeding.
Heparin was held while an IVC filter was placed, her blood count stabilized, and heparin was re-initiated given high risk complications from PE.
Her hematocrit remained stabled and she was moved back out to the medical floor.
She will need a repeat colonoscopy in the future, either if she is ever off the warfarin, or as an elective procedure well after stabilization from this hospitalization.
Medications on Admission: Levofloxacin 500mg daily Hydromorphone 2-4mg q3hr PRN Diazepam 5mg q6hr PRN Lisinopril 20mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
Outpatient [**Name (NI) **] Work PT/INR check [**2129-2-16**], and continually thereafter for goal INR [**3-2**].
While your INR is less than 2.
The bleeding in the GI tract was most likely from the rectal or sigmoid colon area as per a bleeding scan done at the time.
It was confirmed with your PCP that [**Name Initial (PRE) **] colonoscopy done [**2128-3-28**] was normal.
Please have your INR checked 1 day after discharge and fax to your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] thereafter at the discretion of your doctors -- Lovenox shots will be given to you to take home (100mg).
If your INR goes below 2, you will need to take this shot subcutaneously twice daily until your INR is greater than 2.
