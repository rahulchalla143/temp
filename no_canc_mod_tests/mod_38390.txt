Otherwise, he does not have sick contacts and his weights have been stable.
He was initially placed on a non-rebreather which raised his oxygen saturation to the 90s.
His oxygen saturations remained in the high 90s on biPAP.
Labs were significant for a lactate of 3.1, negative troponin, creatinine of 1.3 up from 1, and a slighly elevated white count to 12.8.
Prior to transfer to the MICU vital signs were BP=126/69, HR=99, RR=20, POx=89% on 5L NC.

Brief Hospital Course: MR [**Known lastname 7493**] is a 76 year old male with PMH of stage II COPD with an FEV1 consistently in the low 60s on 3-5L of home O2, pulmonary HTN with estimated pulmonary pressures of 84 mm Hg on recent ECHO [**6-25**], secondary polycythemia, obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, diastolic congestive heart failure, and HTN, recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for 4 days in mid-[**2185-6-14**] for dyspnea deemed to be related to a COPD/diastolic CHF exacerbation, now re-presenting with dyspnea and hypoxia initially requiring biPAP initiation in the emergency room.
This was initially concerning for possible pneumonia, but exam and CXR findings were not suggestive of this and patient remained afebrile.
Recent evaluation of chronic hypoxia revealed chest CT with possible TBM, small airways disease, and several pulmonary nodules, and ECHO with worsening pulmonary artery hypertension with estimated pressure of 84 mm Hg from 51 mm Hg in [**10-24**].
PFTs remained stable and a V/Q scan which was low probability for PE.
He has had a bubble study in [**10-24**] which was suboptimal for evaluation of cardiopulmonary shunt.
Given concern for pulmonary hytertension, he [**Date Range 1834**] evaluation with right heart catheterization which revealed significant pulmonary hypertension with some response nitric oxide administration.
A CTA of the chest was negative for PE, however, concerning for findings of pneumonitis.
The final read of CT was pending at the time of discharge, however, imaging reviewed with attending and communicated with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
EF > 55% and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and moderately dilated right ventricular cavity with moderate global free wall hypokinesis on most recent ECHO in [**6-25**].
Right heart catheterization confirmed that elevated left heart pressures were not primary cause of pulmonary hypertension.
Cr was 1.0 on d/c.
We performed an echocardiogram, which showed no intracardiac shunt.
We also performed a right heart catheterization, which showed pulmonary hypertension that might be responsive to a medication called sildenafil (Rx below).
