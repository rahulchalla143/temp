Subsequent studies showed the following:  Echocardiogram was done on [**2161-6-17**], which showed an ejection fraction of 60 percent, an ascending aorta 4.9 cm with aortic valve peak velocity of 2.6, and a gradient of 26 mm, 1 plus AI,  1 plus MR, and borderline pulmonary artery systolic pressure hypertension.
Cardiac catheterization which was performed in [**6-28**], showed normal coronary arteries, mild aortic insufficiency, normal LV function with LVEDP of 17, a cardiac index of 2.3, no gradient across the aortic valve, and a large aneurysm in the ascending aorta.
Mitral valve prolapse, which was diagnosed as a teenager.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  CT scan of the chest on [**2161-6-4**] showed a 5 cm ascending aorta, small pulmonary AV malformation in the right lobe, in the medial basal segment, and descending aorta within normal limits.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 137, potassium 3.8, chloride 106, CO2 24, BUN 14, creatinine 0.7 with a blood sugar of 120.
PT 12.5, PTT 33, and INR of 1.0.
White count 4.8, hematocrit 35.2 with a platelet count of 196,000.
Preoperatively, her EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 57 with left anterior hemiblock.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her height is 5 feet 6 inches with a weight of 138 pounds.
Her heart was bradycardiac in a regular rhythm with positive S1 and S2 sounds and a grade 2 to 3 over 6 systolic murmur heard best at the lower sternal border and third intercostal space.
Her neurologic exam was grossly intact without any motor or sensory deficits.
She had 2 plus bilateral femoral pulses, 2 plus bilateral DP pulses, 1 plus bilateral PT pulses, and 2 plus bilateral radial pulses without any carotid bruit.
She had an echocardiogram to rule out any cardiac tamponade from bleeding.
She was in sinus rhythm at 78 with a cardiac index of 2.79.
Her hematocrit was 30 with a white count of 12.1 and an INR of 1.0.
Postoperative labs also included a white count of 12.1, a platelet count of 356,000, sodium 140, potassium 4.8, chloride 110, CO2 24, BUN 11, and creatinine 0.5 with a blood sugar of 101.
Her abdominal exam and incisional exams were benign.
She continued on perioperative Kefzol antibiotic coverage and was encouraged to use her incentive spirometer and to get out of bed by the nurses.
On postoperative day two, her hematocrit drifted back down to about 26.1.
She was in sinus rhythm in the 90s with a blood pressure of 97/53, saturating 99 percent.
Her white count dropped slightly to 10.2.
Her creatinine remained stable at 0.5.
Her diet was advanced and her electrolytes repleted as needed.
Her INR was 1.3, as she now had begun her Coumadin aiming for a therapeutic dose for her mechanical aortic valve.
She had a T-Max of 100.7 degrees, heart rate rose slightly to 102 with a blood pressure of 97/66.
Her anticoagulation continued to be underway with her INR rising that morning slightly to 1.4.
Her hematocrit dropped slightly to 24.6 with the plan to let her be discharged home once her INR crossed 1.5 and she was able to do the stairs.
Her INR rose to 1.5 and hematocrit of 25.0.
Her potassium remained stable at 4.3 and also her creatinine at 0.5.
Her blood pressure at that time was 112/45 and was saturating 98 percent on room air with a heart rate of 71 and a respiratory rate of 18 and was afebrile.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 140**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 141**], in approximately one to two weeks; her cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], in approximately one to two weeks; and to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in the office at approximately three to four weeks for her postoperative surgical visit.
for 3 days, then INR check    on [**2161-7-27**] with INR and Coumadin dosing management by Dr.    [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 140**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 141**].
