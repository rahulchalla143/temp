TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain without IV contrast including axial FLAIR, gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted sequences.
MR angiogram of the brain with 3D time-of-flight and multiplanar reformatted images.
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Numerous areas of focal increased T2 and FLAIR signal intensity are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres as well as in the periventricular white matter surrounding both lateral ventricles.
MRI [**Location (un) 4059**] small vessel ischemic changes.
Areas of susceptibility on gradient echo images may represent early amyloid angiopathy or sequela from prior small emboli.

THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.
Peak transmital gradient is 5mm of Hg and a mean of 3mm of Hg (immediate post-bypass).
Gentle diuresis and beta blockade started and heparin continued until INR therapeutic.
Vascular service also consulted and CT scanning /US completed for the femoral neuropathy.
All exams negative for hematoma or fluid collection.Neurontin started per neurology and follow up encouraged with neurology clinic post-discharge.Right leg pain improved on discharge day with dilaudid.
Coumadin dosing and INR follow up to be done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30197**].
First blood draw to be done [**6-16**].
