RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed increased air space disease with persistent interstitial disease, right internal jugular catheter and right peripherally inserted catheter in place.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at 27, with a long P-R interval.
A computed tomography scan of the head was ordered as well as electroencephalogram.
Vancomycin, ceftazidime, metronidazole, and ampicillin were continued.
After an oral airway was placed, it was possible to discontinue paralysis, and the patient remained comfortable on pressor support ventilation.
A lumbar puncture was attempted on [**11-22**] and failed.
It was noted that lumbar puncture had been attempted the week prior with no success, and this procedure was not again repeated after this attempt.
Pressor support was decreased to a certain extent, but the patient was unable to become independent of the ventilator.
Levels of positive end-expiratory pressure were required at all times for the patient's comfort.
On [**11-25**], Ms. [**Known lastname 9302**] blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
All intravenous medications, fluids, and laboratory draws were otherwise discontinued; including intravenous phenylephrine.
The patient's husband [**Location (un) 4597**] was called and notified at 6:40 p.m.  A postmortem examination was declined.
