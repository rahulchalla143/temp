CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2110-12-12**] No hemodynamically significant stenosis was identified in the bilateral extracranial carotid arteries .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2110-12-11**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2110-12-11**] 12:33 PM CONCLUSION: Unremarkable MRI and MRA of the head for age.
A senile drowsy pattern is considered normal for this age although deep midline dysfunction cannot be fully excluded.
Found to have thrombocytopenia consistent with HIT and may have suffered a TIA  with negative head CT and MRI/MRA.
## Thrombocytopenia: Patient's platelet count was 122K on admission and dropped three days later to 62K.
Argatroban ggt was discontinued after the INR was >3 after a 3 hour trial off argatroban.
Also, per heme/onc time course of thrombocytopenia was shorter than expected for development of HIT Ab (usually 5-6 days) however in the setting of a possible TIA, patient will continue warfarin with goal INR betw [**2-20**] until follow-up at hematology/oncology clinic.
Head CT was negative for bleed.
Head MRI/MRA was negative for acute ischemia.
Carotid doppler showed no significant stenosis.
HBAIC 6.0 and lipid panel within normal limits.
Unclear whether facial signs were TIA or twitching so EEG was performed which was negative for epileptiform activity.
# Ischemia: patient had PTCA [**12-8**] revealing an LAD 60% occlus, patent Lcx & RCA.
Repeat echo [**12-9**] EF 25-30% severe LV hypokinesis and LV sys fcn depression, RV sys fcn depression, no endocarditis.
