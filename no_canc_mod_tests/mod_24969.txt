Sent to Dr [**First Name (STitle) 7756**] for echo which revealed wall motion abnomality and mild LV dysfunction  related to an infarct.
Echo LFEF is 45%.
ETT Nuclear showed reduced LVEF 22% with lateral ischemia and inferoposterior hypokinesis.
She was referred for a cardiac catheterization and was found to have mitral valve regurgitation and coronary artery disease.

[**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]   FINDINGS: BACKGROUND: There was technical difficulty with continuous FP1 electrode artifact.
There were also infrequent bifrontal bursts of low amplitude 1 Hz delta which were superimposed with beta activity.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 80-85 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study due to frequent fairly widespread, frontally predominant runs of sharp and slow wave discharges that are often synchronous but on occasions more on the right.
This EEG showed no change compared to previous day.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral chest x-ray.
COMPARISON: Multiple chest radiographs during this hospital stay, latest one on [**2150-9-5**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
She underwent cardiac catherization which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease, moderate mitral regurgitation with mean wedge pressure of 24 mmHg, moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction with an EF of 40%, and a tightly occluded proximal left subclavian artery.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and further preoperative evaluation was performed.
Neurology was consulted and head CT scan was obtained, showing no acute intracranial process.
EEG findings were consistent with seizure, revealing frequent epileptiform discharges.
Dilantin levels were monitored closely and dosed accordingly.
MRI was obtained on postoperative day two which showed no evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage.
She otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and was transfused with PRBCs to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
Following extubation, she underwent speech and swallow evaluation which showed a functional swallowing mechanism without overt sign/symptoms of aspiration.
Continuous EEG monitoring was eventually discontinued and no further seizure activity was noted.
She remained in a normal sinus rhythm with no further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
