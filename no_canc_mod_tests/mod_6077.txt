She had documented O2 saturations of 86-89% on 5 liters, and was sent to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for further evaluation.
EXAMINATION UPON PRESENTATION:  Temperature to 103, heart rate 164 with blood pressure 122/77.
Respiratory rate of 24, and O2 saturation is 98% on a nonrebreather mask.
Her cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia with slight grade 1/6 systolic murmur at the right lower sternal border.
Neurologic examination reveals left sided weakness in the arm and leg.
LABORATORIES UPON ADMISSION:  White count 18 with 10% bands, hematocrit 34.5, platelets 155.
Chemistries were significant for a potassium of 3.0, BUN of 30, and a creatinine of 1.1, and a glucose of 302.
Troponin was noted later to be 4.3.
Her PT was 13.5 and PTT was 28.
Her initial blood gas was a pH of 7.5, a pCO2 of 33, pO2 of 72.
Her electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, rate of [**Street Address(2) 38172**] depressions noted in leads I, aVL, and V4 through V5 to about 1 mm.
The chest x-ray as noted revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate.

Thoracentesis was performed on the day following admission of which 5 cc of purulent pleural fluid was removed and the fluid was sent for culture eventually growing out MRSA.
She was noted to be hypotensive and became septic on the night following VATS with an increase on her white blood cell count to 24,000.
She was also cultured for additional organisms which did not reveal any other bacterial organisms.
Because of her hypotension, she was started on dopamine briefly, and then changed to Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support.
Her white count decreased with continuation of Vancomycin.
As stated, her blood pressures remained better indicating that her sepsis was resolving.
