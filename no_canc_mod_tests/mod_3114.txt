CXR [**11-12**]: Interstitial edema increased.
CXR [**11-20**]: FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central venous catheter and nasogastric tube appear unchanged.
ECHO [**11-22**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Micro Data: [**11-9**]: UCx w/proteus, sputum w/MRSA [**11-18**]: sputum w/stenotrophomonas BCx [**11-12**] negative BCx [**11-18**], [**11-19**], [**11-20**], [**11-21**] pending R IJ tip [**11-22**] culture negative UCx x2 [**11-19**] negative 3x CDiff negative ([**11-12**], [**11-13**], [**11-14**])   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 89 yo with PMH of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia .
UCx grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, initial sputum grew MRSA.
BCx from [**11-9**], [**11-12**] negative.
BCx from [**11-18**], [**11-19**], [**11-20**], [**11-21**] all pending.
UCx during this time were negative and sputum grew out Stenotrophomonas sensitive to Bactrim.
Although blood pressure is low at baseline, patient always makes urine.
Stool tests for C. diff negative x 3 & flagyl stopped [**11-15**].
ECHO relatively unremarkable given patient?????
Repeat ECHO w/normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Fluid balance should be maintained.
She has been both very hypervolemic and exterienced flash pulmonary edema during her stay, and fluid balance has been difficult.
Her sodium and other electrolytes should be monitored every other day until stable and PO intake of fluids encouraged.
Would reassess fluid status daily and give small doses of Lasix as tolerated by blood pressure.
old records show ekg w/nsr at 65 w/1st degree AV block 3 years ago.
#9 Anemia: hemoconcentrated upon admission, HCT trended to mid to upper 20s during here stay.
Further workup should be initiated by her PCP.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day).
Vital signs should be monitored daily.
Fluid balance should be maintained.
She has been both very hypervolemic and exterienced flash pulmonary edema during her stay, and fluid balance has been difficult.
She will need every other day electrolytes and CBC checked until stable.
