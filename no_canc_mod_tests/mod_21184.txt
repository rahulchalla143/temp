EGD ([**2147-5-8**]) Esophagus: Lumen: A complex, sliding, medium paraesophageal hernia was seen.
A hemoclip was then applied to the visible vessel.
She remained HD stable with SBP in 110s and HR in 70s after initial 2L NS bolus.
She was transiently on a PPI drip and was transfused a total of 4U with HCT coming up to 27 from 18.
Her HCT remained stable after these initial 4 units.
GI did not feel that the pt was still actively bleeding, thus no urgent scope was performed in the MICU.
She had an EGD performed by GI which demonstrated a single cratered ulcer in the duodenal bulb with stigmata of recent bleeding.
The pt's HCT was stable for the remainder of her [**Hospital 62681**] hospital stay at around 27 to 28.
The pt's antihypertensives were held in this setting and her blood pressure was well-controlled with only diltiazem.
In the setting of having her beta blocker held, the pt was noted to have several episodes of AF with RVR (HR to the 140s), as well as two episodes of SVT (HR again to 140s) that was thought to likely represent AVNRT.
A TSH and CXR were checked and were unremarkable.
A chest x-ray after several days without Lasix did not demonstrate any evidence of failure.
A echo in [**2145**] demonstrated preserved EF and mild AR.
This was deferred at the time of discharge so that the pt's HCT could be followed for another 1-2 weeks.
