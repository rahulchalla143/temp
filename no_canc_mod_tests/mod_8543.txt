Nephrocaps 1 tablet q. day.
The patient was admitted on the 13th for a work-up of her aortic murmur and her known four plus aortic insufficiency and three plus mitral insufficiency.
Her exercise tolerance test had shown no perfusion defects and an ejection fraction of 72%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  When she was admitted to Cardiology she was noted to be thin with a blood pressure of 124/53, saturating 98% on room air with a heart rate in sinus at 81; respiratory rate of 20.
Prior work-up had also shown an echocardiogram in [**2132-12-11**], which showed mild left atrial enlargement, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and a normal ejection fraction.
Her aortic valve gradient was 23 with a peak of 44 at that time.
On [**2133-3-18**], she had a CT scan of the chest which showed stable tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities and the right apex was consistent with bronchiolitis.
LABORATORY:  Prior to admission were white blood cell count of 6.8, hematocrit of 36.6, platelet count of 348,000.
Sodium 138, potassium 5.1, chloride 104, CO2 21, BUN 26, creatinine 8.3 with a platelet count of 73,000.
INR was 1.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac catheterization was done which showed normal coronary arteries, aortic insufficiency, mitral regurgitation.
Her ejection fraction was normal.
Her last set of laboratories prior to the Operating Room was sodium 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 103, CO2 23, BUN 30, creatinine 8.6, white count of 5.4, blood sugar of 100, hematocrit of 34 and platelet count of 190,000.
She was transferred to Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on a Neo-Synephrine drip, Propofol drip and a protenin infusion.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which did not show an effusion and the patient's bleeding decreased; the patient was returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
She received intravenous heparin to cover her valves in preparation for starting her on Coumadin, but her platelet count continued to drop.
HIT antibodies were sent which were negative.
The patient was also started on Dopamine on postoperative day six for blood pressures that waned in the 90s over 50s.
Cultures were sent off; urinalysis was sent.
The white count decreased the next day to 17.6.
Blood cultures had all been sent off on day six and came back with Gram negative rods.
The patient's lactate rose over the next couple of days to 7.5 and the patient started to have respiratory symptoms with increased dyspnea as well as continuing persistent hypotension.
Liver enzymes were all elevated.
On that day, her total bilirubin was 21.9.
A bedside echocardiogram showed increasing pleural effusions with tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient continued to have a dropped SER with an increasing cardiac output and cardiac index of approximately 4 with a growing septic picture.
Filling pressures rose to CVP of 24 and PA pressures of 54/30.
The right IJ and radial A-line cultures came back as E. coli.
On postoperative day 13, the patient had an ultrasound of the belly which showed ascites in bilateral lower quadrants.
On postoperative day 15, the patient was hypothermic; also, possibly due to her CVVH, her white count rose to 24.9.
Blood cultures which had also been sent also came back positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
Her central line which had also been withdrawn also came back positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
Her PT on that morning was 43 with an INR of 13.2.
