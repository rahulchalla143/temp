[**2112-3-7**] CT C-SPINE: 1.
Apparent mild anterior disc space widening at the C7-T1 level, while there is no surrounding soft tissue abnormality raises conern for a possible ligamentous injury, an MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
[**2112-3-7**] CT TORSO: 1.
[**2112-3-8**] CT RLE: Type 3 Schatzker fracture of the right anterolateral tibial plateau with 7 mm of depression accompanied by lipohemarthrosis.
[**2112-3-8**] CT CYSTOGRAM: 1.
[**2112-3-10**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1.
Multiple rib fractures, as seen on the prior CT examination on [**2112-3-7**].
Initial aortogram revealed 2 areas suspicious for active extravasation of contrast from the L internal iliac artery.
However, selective arteriogram did not reveal any active bleeding.
Post-procedure she was transferred back to the TSICU for close monitoring and serial hct checks.
The next day on [**2112-3-8**], the patient underwent evaluation by anesthesia/acute pain and had a thoracic epidural placed with good pain control.
More plain film x-rays of her extremities and a CT of her RLE were obtained per the request of the orthopedics team.
She also underwent a CT cystogram, which revealed no evidence of bladder injury and no contrast seen outside the bladder.
Serial hcts were checked throughout the day and they remained stable around 30.
However, her hct at 9pm was 25 and this trended down to 21 at midnight.
A repeat hct at 1am on [**2112-3-9**] was 20.4.
She was transfused 2 units of blood and a stat CXR was obtained to evaluate for worsening of her hemopneumothorax.
The CXR showed no significant changes.
IR felt that her bleed was likely venous but that if she became unstable or dropped her hct significantly, they would be prepared to take her for a repeat angio.
Her pain was adequately controlled and her hematocrit was stable.
She will need further rehab to increase her mobility and endurance.
Her chest xray still shows some small bilateral effusions without any evidence of consolidation.
Her DVT prophylaxix is with Lovenox 40 mg daily for 30 days post op.
Right hydropneumothorax 6.
