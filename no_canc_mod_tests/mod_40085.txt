CT Torso [**6-22**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
No definite evidence of injury on CT torso.
CT adrenal protocol, or MRI can be done to evaluate further.
CT Sinus [**6-22**]: IMPRESSION: Committed fractures at the nasal bones, and nasal septum.
MRI Knee [**6-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Findings of posterolateral corner injury as described with concomitant tears of the ACL and PCL and avulsion fracture of the fibular head.
CTA of Head [**6-26**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Comminuted fracture of the nasal bone and nasal septum, not significantly changed since the prior study.
CT C-spine [**7-1**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Degenerative changes of the cervical spine are better described on prior examination with unchanged narrowing of the cervical canal at C6-C7.
His facial lacerations were irrigated and sutured by Plastic Surgery.
His fibula fracture was managed non operatively; he was fitted with a knee immobilizer and is to remain non weight bearing on that extremity.
An MRI of his left knee was done which shows a lateral cruciate ligament tear for which he will follow up as an outpatient if further intervention warranted.
On [**7-1**], CT of the C-spine was performed to evaluate hardware placement.
