[**Name2 (NI) **] to have CKMB 8.3, CK 113, troponin 0.65.
EKG showed ST elevations in V4, V5, ST depression in V3, diffuse Tw inversions, Q waves in II, aVF.
On the morning of transfer ([**9-5**]), pt developed hypercapnic respiratory failure with ABG 7.18/74/137.
Her EKG showed ST elevations in I, II, III, aVL, AVF, V2-6, Q waves in II, III, aVF, V5, V6; diffuse, deep inverted T waves.
Pt was hypotensive with SBP in the 40s-70s.
Given levophed and dopamine, and BP increased to 120s/60s.

* Cardiovascular: The patient underwent a cath that revealed a 70% proximal LAD stenosis, no sign of acute plague rupture.
Her cardiac enzymes trended down.
An echocardiogram on hospital day 4 revealed LVEF of 60-70% with LV apical hypokinesis and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Her BP and HR remained stable during the hospital stay.
* Anemia: The patient's hematocrit trended down during the admission requiring transfusion of 1 unit PRBC x2.
Iron studies suggested anemia of chronic disease.
Her Hct remained stable for the rest of her hospitalization.
Initial sputum culture grew out sparse, pan-sensitive Pseudomonas; initial blood and urine cultures were negative.
