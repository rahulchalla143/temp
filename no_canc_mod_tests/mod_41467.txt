On transfer, her white blood cell count was 6.8, her hematocrit was 28.7.
Her INR was 2.0.
Her dig level was 1.0.
Sepsis:  This 87-year-old female, who had a recent MRSA UTI, history of multiple aspirations, had recently been partially treated for a urinary tract infection versus aspiration pneumonia, which was seen on her initial chest x-ray.
Her vancomycin troughs were followed.
Her fecal stool cultures were negative.
Her blood cultures had no growth to date the date of discharge.
Her sputum culture did grow MRSA.
Her urine culture was no growth.
A repeat P-A and lateral chest x-ray on [**2105-4-6**] did show bilateral patchy opacities, which could be consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Her vancomycin level was 20 the day prior to discharge, therefore her vancomycin level was spaced out to q.48h.
Of note, the blood cultures from [**3-31**], which grew Staph coag-negative 2/2 bottles were considered a contaminate by the [**Hospital1 8**] laboratory.
Blood cultures on [**3-24**] did not grow out any infection and the blood cultures from [**4-3**] also were no growth to date.
The team recommends that the patient have surveillance blood cultures drawn q week while the patient is on her vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.
In addition, if the patient spikes a temperature or becomes febrile after discontinuing her two week course of antibiotics, the team felt it would be wise at that time to obtain a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out endocarditis more accurately.
The patient did have a transthoracic echocardiogram during this hospital stay, which did not show any evidence of vegetations.
On her chest x-ray, she did have some evidence of congestive heart failure, however, her oxygen saturations remained stable throughout this hospital stay.
with a goal diuresis of -500 to 1 liter q.d.
The metoprolol was unable to be increased further given that her blood pressure remained in the 100-115 range and her heart rate was more consistently in the 60s.
She should have her digoxin level monitored at minimum q month to make sure that she is on the correct dose.
The patient was also continued on Coumadin, her goal INR is [**2-3**].
The day prior to discharge her INR was 3.0.
Her INR should be monitored three days after discharge to ensure she is on the proper dosing.
Maintaining good oxygen saturations on 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen.
Sodium chloride nasal spray [**1-2**] sprays t.i.d.
OUTPATIENT LABORATORY WORK:  The patient should have her INR drawn three days after discharge to monitor her INR while she is on levofloxacin.
In addition, she should have followup q2 days while she continues on the antibiotics to ensure her INR is in the therapeutic range.
In addition, she should have surveillance blood cultures drawn one week after discharge to ensure her treatment regimen is adequate.
She should also have repeat surveillance blood cultures drawn on discontinuation of antibiotics at two weeks.
Her primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25**] will need to followup on her INR level three days after discharge as well as the surveillance blood cultures one week after discharge and two weeks after discharge.
