He was taken to OSH where exam showed minimal strength in UE's and LE's.
CT C spine showed no fx, MRI T/L spine showed degenerative changes but did capture C5-C6 stenosis and cord signal change.

Delayed excretion of the right kidney; left kidney is surgically absent; IV hydration is recommended  MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2118-3-7**] 1.
EEG [**2118-3-8**] A single EKG channel shows a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 35 bpm.
CXR [**2118-3-9**] Heart size is enlarged but stable.
Minimal right basal opacity most likely reflects area of atelectasis, better appreciated on the CT torso from [**3-7**], [**2118**].
Carotid dopplers [**3-11**] Right ICA no stenosis.
LENS [**2118-3-14**] DVT with small focal nonocclusive clot seen in the right popliteal vein.
He was taken to an OSH where c-spine imaging revealed stenosis and he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical evaluation.
MRI c-spine revealed stenosis at C4-6 with T2 signal changes.
On [**3-8**], his exam revealed weakness in his bilateral triceps and IPs.
FSBS was stable / his VS were stable except for his persistent bradycardia.
They felt that Given that he had a good chronotropic response to the 150's on stress echo in [**10/2117**], he will likely be able to mount a response to the physiologic stressors during the operation planned for Friday.
EEG was done to eval for seizure activity in light of seizure history from age 18, the last one in [**2117-7-23**].
EEG was done and this showed some occasional right frontotemporal epileptiform discharges indicative of a potential epileptogenic focus in this region.
Level was 90 on [**3-9**].
Nephrology was contact[**Name (NI) **] due to his history of left nephrectomy, decreased clearing at right kidney during torso scan and elevated BUN/creatinine.
Pm labs on [**3-9**] showed a drop in Creat from 1.5 to 1.2 and drop in Bun from 39 to 35 and K was 4.4.
