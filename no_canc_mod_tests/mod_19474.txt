[**2191-10-26**] EGD and Colonoscopy [**2191-10-28**] Capsule study   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year old female with rheumatic heart disease and history of coronary artery disease.
Echocardiogram at that time was notable for aortic stenosis.
Once her bleeding issues resolved, she underwent cardiac catheterization.
Left Ventriculograhpy showed an LVEF of 50% without mitral regurgitation through the mechanical MVR.
Coronary angiography showed total occlusion of LAD, 60% lesion in the distal circumflex and patent stents in the RCA.
Right and left heart catheterization demonstrated critical aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.5cm2 and mean gradient of 37mmHg.
The mean PA pressure was 30mmHg and cardiac output was 3.2l/min very consistent with congestive heart failure.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Capsule study was performed along with EUS, EGD and colonoscopy.
Colonoscopy revealed a few non-bleeding diverticula.
(There are no official results of the EUS and capsule study at the time of this dictation.)
For further surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
Heparin was resumed for a subtherapeutic prothrombin time while Warfarin anticoagulation was restarted.
She was pan-cultured for a leukocytosis, white count peaked to 25K on postoperative day three.
Sputum and blood cultures were negative while urine culture grew out yeast.
A bedside swallow examination was performed on postoperative five for a coughing episode following thin liquids.
Evaluation showed no overt signs of aspiration but silent aspiration could not be ruled out.
She continued to progress and was ready for discharge to rehab on POD 9 with plan for INR to be checked [**11-13**] goal INR 3-3.5   Medications on Admission: Aspirin 81 qd, Lipitor 80 qd, Aldactone 25 qd, Lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **], Toprol XL 50 qd, Allopurinol 300 qd, Digoxin 0.125 qd, Kdur, IV Heparin/Warfarin  Discharge Medications: 1.
Coumadin 3 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO once a day for 2 days: please take 3mg on [**11-11**] and [**11-12**] - have INR checked [**11-13**] for further dosing.
Monitor prothrombin time as directed.
Warfarin should be adjusted for goal INR between 3-3.5.
