There, she was found to have a subcapital left femoral neck fracture as well as a subdural hematoma along the falx and left tentorium; this was stable on a repeat head CT later the same day.
Her labs were notable for a creatinine of 1.59 (unknown baseline), WBC 8.8, troponin-T 0.02, and were otherwise normal.

She was also noted to be oliguric with less than 10 cc of urine output for several hours; this increased modestly with a 1000 cc bolus of LR.
There, she was found to have a subcapital left femoral neck fracture as well as a subdural hematoma along the falx and left tentorium; this was stable on a repeat head CT later the same day.
She was seen by neurosurgery who felt that her small subdural hematoma was stable on serial head CT scans and did not feel this was a contraindication to surgery.
If the family so desires, she will need follow up in 4 weeks per neurosurgery at which time a repeat CT will be obtained and the decision of whether or not to restart Aggrenox will be made at that time.
# Anemia:  Admission hct 33, trended down to 24, received 1u pRBC with appropriate bump.
Hct on discharge was stable at 26.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO twice a day: Hold for SBP <100, HR<60.
