CAD: Had cardiac cath in [**2101**] with no intervention done per patient although does have vague history of "scar" on heart.
Patient had three sets of cardiac enzymes that were negative.
She had no complaints of chest pain and her EKGs showed no ST/TW changes so she was essentially ruled out for MI.
She had some episodes of tachycardia (180 BPM) overnight and thus her toprol was re-started (12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]).
She had a followup chest x-ray that showed ppm leads in place.
However, she was nervous about having an infection and wanted us to check it so a UA C+S were sent and were pending at time of transfer.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR 1 week after discharge and have results called into the [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital 2786**] [**Hospital **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**].
