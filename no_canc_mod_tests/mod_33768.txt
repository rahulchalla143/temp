A TEE during that admission "showed no evidence of vegetations".
After a third fall on [**11-14**] w/o apparent trauma, she was brought by EMS to MWH, where a head CT showed an intraventricular hemorrhage.
She thinks she lost a considerable amount of weight between her initial admission in [**Month (only) 205**] and her discharge on Thursday - 40lbs.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
Upper extremity and face were normal.

**FINAL REPORT [**2180-11-23**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2180-11-23**]):       REPORTED BY PHONE TO NORREN [**Doctor Last Name **] @ 4:55A [**2180-11-23**].
----------- Blood cultures from [**11-14**], [**11-16**], [**11-17**], [**11-19**], 10/20,[**11-22**] no growth to date ------------  DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  CT HEAD [**2180-11-14**]: Hyperdense lesion within the right lateral ventricle likely represents an intraventricular mass, with associated hemorrhage, though further evaluation with MRI with gadolinium is recommended.
PELVIS CT [**2180-11-14**]: IMPRESSION: No acute fracture.
If there is continued clinical concern for fracture, an MRI could be obtained.
LUMBAR SPINE CT 10/14/08:1.
Diffuse osteopenia, which may limit the sensitivity for detection of nondisplaced fractures.
An MRI of the lumbar spine can be performed for further evaluation.
CXR [**2180-11-14**]: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart is mildly enlarged.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2180-11-16**]: he left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Diagnostic considerations include neurogenic osteoarthropathy (Charcot).
BONE SCAN [**2180-11-17**]: IMPRESSION: Positive three-phase bone scan in the hind and mid feet bilaterally with more focal area of increased uptake in the left midfoot.
Indium 111-WBC study or MRI can be performed for further evaluation.
HEAD CT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2180-11-17**]: FINDINGS: The pre-contrast images again demonstrate high density in the right ventricular atrium, indicative of hemorrhage.
WHITE BLOOD CELL STUDY [**2180-11-20**]:IMPRESSION: Increased tracer uptake in both feet is a non-specific finding, probably related to chronic inflammation due to extensive neuropathic changes; however, a component of bilateral osteomyelitis cannot be excluded with these findings.
CXR [**2180-11-22**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-19**], there is little change.
Pt was brought to outside hospital for evaluation after having multiple falls at home and was found by head CT to have an intraventricular hemorrhage for which she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Head CT did not show evidence of fracture, nor did L spine films.
However, this initial head CT was concerning for intraventricular mass, with associated hemorrhage.
MRI could not be obtained to clarify this question of a mass so CT Head with contrast performed and showed right-sided intraventricular hematoma without any abnormal enhancement surrounding hematoma.
Patient is scheduled to have a brain MRI on [**2180-12-13**] to assess resolution of hemorrhage.
An extensive work-up for potential osteomyelitis was initiated.
MRI of right foot, tagged WBC scan and bone scan were all found to be equivocal.
MRI of left foot uninterpretable due to patient moving.
Patient had normal CXR and no clinical signs of pneumonia.
Urine osmolarity of 501 and urine sodium of 38 consistent with SIADH.
Would suggest continued fluid restriction, but increase fluids to 1500ml/day and monitoring serum sodium until intraventricular hemorrhage resolves.
4)Hypertension: Blood pressures have remained stable.
Neurology recommended keeping systolic pressure <160.
5)Anemia: Likely represents anemia of chronic disease, which is supported by iron studies during this hospitalization.
7) Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Blood sugars remained stable.
Head CT at our hospital confirmed the blood in your brain.
You will need to get an MRI of your brain on [**2180-12-13**].
