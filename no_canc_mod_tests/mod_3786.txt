The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Vein graft angiography revealed a 90% stenosis of the SVG->OM graft.
Resting hemodynamics revealed systemic hypertension.
Left ventriculography was not performed because of the patient's elevated creatinine and mechanical valve.
Successful stenting of the SVG-OM was performed with overlapping 3.0 x 15 mm, 3.0 x 18 mm, and 3.5 x 18 mm Zeta stents.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.

[Intrinsic LV systolic function depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the findings of the study (tape reviewed) of [**2142-11-13**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
We checked an echo which was basically unchanged compared to her echo from [**2141**] except that her mitral-regurgitation had worsened.
She was initially started on dopamine but failed to have improvement in her cardiac output or urine output.
She put out at least 2 liters, following which her creatinine and cardiac output improved.
She went from a cardiac output of 3.9 to 5.3 and clinically felt much better.
Her ACE I was restarted prior to sending her to the step down unit but her BB was still held.
Her baseline creatinine was 2.0 but at admit to the CCU her creatinine was 2.3.
* Hypothyroidsim: Upon admission her TSH was 7.8 and T4 = 5.4.
