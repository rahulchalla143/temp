Throughout his medical intensive care unit course his coagulopathy was aggressively managed with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.  Additionally on [**2161-6-3**] the patient had a right internal jugular line placed and tube feeds were initiated.
His hepatic enzymes remained elevated though slightly decreased from admission throughout the initial part of his hospital course.
Head CT was obtained and this was negative.
