The patient was walking up three flights of stairs, felt dizzy, sat down and lost consciousness.
At that time, he had a TTE which diagnosed aortic stenosis, and a cardiac catheterization which showed left main 95%, LAD 100%, distal LCX 65%, ostial 70% OM3, RCA 100% ostial, SVG-diag 100%, SVG- Lcx not documented, SVG-acute marginal 90% discrete lesion, and SVG-RCA 60%, patent LIMA to LAD .
In the ED, the patient's EKG showed ST elevations in III and aVF, depressions in I and aVL, TWI in V4-V6 consistent with prior and new atrial fibrillation.
The patient's labs were significant for elevation of cardiac enzymes of troponin to 0.18, but no elevation of CK or MB.

COMPARISON: Portable chest radiographs from [**7-9**], [**7-13**] and 31, [**2127**] and CT of the chest from [**2127-6-20**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Most recent echo showed severe aortic stenosis and was already scheduled for elective valve replacement on [**7-7**].
In ED there was new onset atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, rate controlled on beta blockers.
He was appropriately medically managed and underwent pre-op work-up and on [**7-7**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a redo-sternotomy, aortic valve replacement.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
