He was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, where vitals were temp 98.1, bp 127/56, HR 78, RR 15, SaO2 98% on RA.
On exam, he was alert and oriented x3 (GCS 15), two 5 cm lacs to his upper scalp and left facial abrasion, diffusely sore in his neck.
Labs showed WBC 9.0, Hct 39, plt 233, INR 1.1, Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 104, CO2 24, BUN 13, Cr 0.87, glucose 122, Ca 9.3.
Head CT was reported as normal (and although he was sent with a CD, it was reportedly blank and unable to be uploaded to the [**Hospital1 **] system).
CT C-spine showed no fracture.
Right wrist films showed scaphoid fracture and perilunate dislocation.
Left wrist films showed perilunate dislocation and displaced scaphoid fracture.
CXR and pelvic films were normal.
Per the nursing assessment, at 17:22 he had "seizure activity after having CT done", then "second seizure noted with Ativan 1 mg IV given".
He was med flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Past Medical History: none  Social History: Lives with his patents in [**Location 3615**] ETOH : none Tobacco : quit [**2186**]   Family History: + multiple sclerosis maternal aunt  Physical Exam: *The patient had just received Fentanyl 100 IV prior to neurology exam, was off Propofol gtt for 15 minutes (but needed to be placed back on Propofol during the exam given he was waking up.)
VS: temp 99.7, bp 134/75, HR 104, RR 16, SaO2 96% on ventilator Genl: Intubated, off sedation HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, + bilateral conjunctival injection, large left facial laceration with oozing blood, hard C-collar in place.

Oligoclonal bands (4 or more CSF-specific bands) and/or an elevated CSF IgG index are detected in up to 90% of patients with MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4493**], however, are not specific for MS [**First Name (Titles) 3**] [**Last Name (Titles) 56324**]F-specific IgG synthesis may also be found in patients with other neurologic diseases including infectious, inflammatory, cerebrovascular, and paraneoplastic disorders.
Although true seizure activity was in question his Dilantin continued and the length of treatment would be dependent on any further seizure activity and EEG testing off sedation.
The Neurology service followed him closely and recommended an MRI of the brain to further delineate the right frontal hypodense area seen on head CT.
He was pan cultured and also underwent LP to rule out HSV encephalitis as well as oligoclonal band testing to rule out multiple sclerosis.
His HIV ab was negative as was his HSV in his CSF.
He did have oligoclonal bands in his CSF which could aid in the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.
His weight bearing status for his upper extremities was non weight bearing for his hands but full weight bearing for his forearms.
Prior to discharge he underwent an EEG to rule out any seizure activity.
