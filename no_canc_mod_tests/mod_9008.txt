# GI bleed:  Pt presented w/ Hct 14.4 presumably from upper GI source given h/o cirrhosis, melena, coffee ground emesis.
Pt was monitered with serial Hcts and Hct remained stable so pt was c/o to floor.
cardiac due to low Hct but EKG was unremarkable, patient was r/o for MI, and pain resolved.
An abominal ultrasound was performed and demonstrated chronic liver disease, no focal hepatic lesions, splenomegaly (13cm), small volue of ascites, and patency of hepatic and portal veins.
This correlated to an abdominal ultrasound performed on [**11-9**] at [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 18650**] Hospital (NWH) which demonstrated mild liver and splenic enlargement (spleen was 13 cm), no focal liver lesions but with increased echogenicity suggesting diffuse fatty infiltration, and a small amount of ascites.
Iron studies on [**2126-11-5**] demonstrated an iron level of 67 and a ferratin level of 35.4.
Serologies on [**2126-9-10**] were as follows: [**Doctor First Name **] negative, HepBsAB positive, [**Last Name (un) **] IgM negative, [**Last Name (un) **] IgG positive, Hep C w/riba negative.
A liver biopsy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 656**] at NWH on [**2126-11-28**] demonstrated moderate micronodular cirrhosis, with no fatty infiltration in the hepatic parenchyma, no iron deposition seen on iron stain, and normal bile ducts.
During this hospitalization, an AFP level was not elevated (2.4), and hepatitis B serologies were pending at the time of discharge.
Depression  Discharge Condition: Good: Hematocrit stable, no signs of significant further bleeding, no signs of withdrawal   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a gastrointestinal bleed.
