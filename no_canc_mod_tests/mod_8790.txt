Head CT reportedly showed no ICH.
Her INR was reversed.
She underwent gastroscopy which showed no ulcer, but did show gastritis and duodenitis.
CT was consistent with intraperitoneal bleed.
She received 2 more U PRBCs on admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] causing her Hct to bump from 24->31, and requiried Neo for a period of time.
She underwent an exploratory laparotomy (as her Hct initially appropriately bumped to 31 but then decreased to 27 within hours) and was found intraoperatively to have a grade III splenic laceration so a splenectomy was performed on [**2118-1-3**].
An umbilical hernia was also repaired intraoperatively.
On POD 3 she was transfused 2 more U PRBCs since her Hct had slowly trended down to 25.5, and this bumped to 36.7 then stabilized at 32.
