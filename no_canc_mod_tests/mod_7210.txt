GRAM STAIN (Final [**2163-12-14**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Sepsis - When pt arrived, appeared to have septic picture but resolved during stay and by the time of her ERCP she was afebrile, stable hemodynamics, and without elevated white count.
She was C. diff negative x3 now, and had relatively small amount of stool output, and her white count is stable.
Pancreatitis - The patient was noted to have elevated amylase and lipase at OSH as evidence of pancreatitis, but on admission did not have any evidence on CT-scan.
Pancreatic enzymes were trending down and were normal by arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].
However, they were then increasing theraafter, while [**Hospital1 **] resolved while pancreatic enzymes were continuing to increase.
GI bleeding - By the time of transfer there was no current evidence for GI bleed; C diff and ischemic colitis were in differential as well for guiaic-positive diarrhea, but C diff was negative and clinical course was not consistent with worsening ischemic colitis.
Podiatry saw, noted that they further debrided the HPK, tract probed to bone, applied W-D dressing to toe.
They recommended that she will need ulcer excision and removal of distal phalanx when stable.
Her wound culture is pending as of this dictation but it appears to be growing coag + staph aurues.
A vancomycin level should be checked in 3 days given her previous ARF.
PPx - venodynes, no heparin because of GI bleeding though if course continues well, could revisit this;  no bowel regimen given diarrhea but if stool output continues to reduce in quantity could consider gentle restart.
Dispo - to [**Hospital3 2568**] (pt requesting transfer).
