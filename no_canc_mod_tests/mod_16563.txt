An exercise treadmill test done on [**2163-4-28**] depressions on the lateral leads with prior and post echocardiogram which showed inferior wall hypokinesis.
Additionally, mild-to-moderate systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40% with concomitant 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and trace mitral regurgitation was noted.
On cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 188**], left anterior descending artery showed 60% to 80% stenosis, left circumflex showed 70% stenosis at the first obtuse marginal to second obtuse marginal, right coronary artery with moderate diffuse irregularities with a subtotal occlusion after the posterior descending artery with left-to-right collaterals.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate was 77 (sinus), blood pressure was 121/72, respiratory rate was 20, and oxygen saturation was 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric.
The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed no evidence of rash.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent laboratories as of [**2163-5-10**]; white blood cell count was 12.7, hematocrit was 28.4, and platelets were 355.
Sodium was 139, potassium was 3.9, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 26, and creatinine was 1.2.
Calcium was 9, magnesium was 1.9, and phosphate was 4.4.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 1024**] is a 69-year-old female with progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion with corresponding cardiac catheterization revealing 3-vessel disease localized to the left anterior descending artery, left circumflex, and right coronary artery.
By postoperative day two, the patient was tolerating a diet as tolerated, and the patient's cordis was removed along with the chest tube.
By postoperative day three, the patient required an additional 2 units of packed red blood cells; following which pressors were weaned off.
By postoperative day four, the patient continued to maintain good blood pressures and oxygen saturations; and Lopressor was correspondingly titrated higher.
Additionally, on postoperative day five, the patient's white blood cell count elevated to 12.8.
Without any clear source, and the patient continuing to be afebrile, a urinalysis was sent which confirmed the suspicion of a urinary tract infection.
By postoperative day six, the patient was doing very well, tolerating diet, and maintaining good oxygen saturations on room air.
The patient was also to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4469**] in one week for evaluation of cardiac medications as well as further evaluation to extend the Lasix usage.
