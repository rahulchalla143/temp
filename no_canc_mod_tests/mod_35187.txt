MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT GADOLINIUM.
MRA OF THE BRAIN USING 3D TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUE.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were also bursts of mixed frequency slowing seen bilaterally and independently in temporal areas or a bit more broadly, with a mild rightsided emphasis.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with frequent PVCs.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Has been stable, on head CT [**6-25**], no evidence of recurrent bleed or hydrocephalus.
Pt will need a repeat MRI in one month and should follow up with neurosurgery after as an outpatient.
CXR unremarkable, UA negative.
-Head CT negative for bleed or hydrocephalus.
Acute infarct unlikely giving lack of focality of symptoms and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] of MS, MRI shows no evidence of acute infarct.
- TSH slightly elevated, FT4 WNL, c/w subclinical hypothyroidism, to follow up as outpatient and consider possible initiation of replacement therapy -no evidence of ongoing infection on CXR or repeat UA.
Chest CT was negative for PE.
Sputum gram stain c/w oropharyngeal flora - Pt on high dose steroids for presumed COPD exacerbation, has completed taper and is  back to home dose of 5mg maintenance.
NGT removed [**6-23**].
