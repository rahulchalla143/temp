There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 52932**] was evaluated by the Trauma Service in the Emergency Room then admitted to the Trauma ICU for further evaluation and management.
His Troponin and CKMB index was normal so he underwent TTE in light of his past history of NSTEMI'[**73**].
There was no wall motion abnormalities and his EF was normal.
The EKG changes were due to demand ischemia (ie pain, trauma ) in the setting of anemia.
His lowest hematocrit was 26 and most recently has stabilized in the 27-30 range.
He remained in the ICU for close neuro monitoring due to his left subdural hematoma.
He had no neurologic  deficits and a repeat head CT was unchanged.
His chest tube was removed on [**2175-10-14**] and a post pull film showed no pneumothorax or effusion.
