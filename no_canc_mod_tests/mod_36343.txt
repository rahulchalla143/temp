Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally.
Examination was, otherwise, nonfocal.
CHEST X-RAY:  Marked cardiomegaly and mild interstitial edema.
There was no change since the EKG dated [**2102-8-15**].
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission showed a white count of 5.6, hematocrit 45.9, platelet count 142,000.
Sodium was 130, potassium 3.7, chloride 97, bicarbonate 25, BUN 30, creatinine 1.6, glucose 88.
First CK was 308, CKMB 3, troponin I less than 0.3.
AST 184, ALT 38, amylase 133, lipase 46, total bilirubin 1.8, LDH ..................... Alkaline phosphatase was 80.
PT 14.3, PTT 28.5, INR 1.4, calcium 8.9, phosphate 3.4, magnesium 2.
The patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out myocardial infarction.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2102-9-25**].
The catheterization disclosed the following:  Normal coronary arteries.
The mean RA pressure was 22 mmHg.
The right ventricular and diastolic pressure was 25 mmHg.
The PA pressure was 70/30 mmHg and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 29 mmHg with a cardiac index by [**Last Name (un) **] of 1.8 liters per minute per meter squared.
The patient was then monitored on telemetry since the day of admission.
Echocardiogram was done on [**9-18**], which disclosed dilatation of the left atrium and right atrium; left ventricular wall thickness was normal; left ventricular cavity was severely dilated; severe global left ventricular hypokinesis marked dilatation of the right ventricular cavity; severe 4+ MR; severe 4+ TR seen.
The RBG done on [**10-2**] showed the following:  1.
Ejection fraction of 27%.
Other aspects of the workup include numerous infectious disease tests, as well as carotid ultrasound, ABI, right upper quadrant, abdominal ultrasound, and liver biopsy.
The abdominal ultrasound done on [**10-2**], disclosed cholelithiasis, no ascites or liver masses, no abdominal aortic aneurysm seen in the visualized portions of the aorta.
Doppler evaluation of the lower extremities shows triphasic w waveforms involving bilateral lower extremities.
The patient underwent a liver biopsy on [**10-4**] to rule out fibrosis or cirrhosis.
The VQ scan done on [**9-18**], [**Location (un) 381**] likelihood of PE.
CT angiogram was done on [**9-18**], which disclosed bilateral ground-glass opacities with focal patchy consolidation, believed to be consistent with CHF.
PFTs were done on [**10-2**], as part of the workup for cardiac transplantation.
This bumped to 3.4 on [**9-19**], after the patient was administered contrast for the CT angiogram.
Twenty-four hour urine was done, which disclosed the creatinine clearance of about 55 cc per minute.
Currently, the patient's renal function has returned to baseline with the creatinine of 1.3.
Liver enzymes decreased as diuresis continued.
The patient underwent a liver biopsy on [**9-24**] to rule out fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Liver biopsy was necessary as part of the cardiac transplantation workup.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Numerous infectious disease tests were sent off as part of the workup for the patient's cardiac transplant.
HCV viral load is 390,000.
Hepatitis A antibody was positive indicating previous EBV.
ENDOCRINE:  Thyroid function studies were sent off as part of the patient's cardiac transplantation workup.
TSH was 4.2, free T4 was 1.1.
LDL was 103, HDL 41, triglycerides 101.
