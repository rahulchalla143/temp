IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2193-4-25**] 6:37 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2189-11-19**], there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with valve replacement and intact midline sternal wires.
CT ABD & PELVIS W & W/O CONTRAST, [**2193-4-26**] 12:46 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2193-4-27**] 10:37 AM FINDINGS: Tip of right PICC is either at or just below the cavoatrial junction, as communicated by telephone by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to nurse, [**Doctor First Name **] at 11:30 a.m. on [**2193-4-27**] at the time of discovery of this finding.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old female with history of Afib on coumadin, prosthetic mitral, aortic and tricuspid valves (rheumatic fever), who presented with 18 hours of hematuria and black stools, found to have an acute 8pt drop in hematocrit within the first day of admission.
By the time of discharge, she had been free of hematuria for days and had a therapeutic INR (2.5-3.5).
CT urogram was unremarkable.
Cytoscopy on [**2193-4-30**] showed ulcers and excoriations in bladder that were cauterized; urine cytology showed no malignant cells, then atypical specimen following.
After the cystoscopy, she continued to have large volume bleeding and her systolic blood pressure dropped to the 70s with altered mental status due to hypovolemic shock.
Hct now stable in 20s and blood pressure stable 90s-110s.
On [**2193-5-15**] the foley was discontinued and she continued to have urine output (no clots) which was not grossly bloody.
The patient and her husband were taught how to perform straight catheterizations if she does not void more than 300 cc of urine every 8 hours.
Last colonoscopy was normal 10 years ago.
Her stool guiac was positive in ED.
Heparin gtt was restarted on [**5-6**] and bridged to warfarin with INR goal 2.5-3.5.
# Urinary tract infection (UTI) - She had a positive urinalysis (leuks, nitrites) on admission and culture grew Pseudomonas sp.
The cultures grew vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and she was started on 10 days of linezolid 600 mg PO BID (was intermittently instrumented).
Her platelet count was monitored closely (especially since she was on heparin gtt for anticoagulation) but it returned to [**Location 213**].
# Osteoporosis: continued alendronate 70 mg weekly, calcium and vitamin D supplements.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please complete her course of PO linezolid 600 mg [**Hospital1 **] for VRE urine culture - Please monitor INR very closely because elevated levels will likely predispose to recurrent hematuria.
The patient and her husband were taught how to perform straight catheterizations if she does not void more than 300 cc of urine every 8 hours.
