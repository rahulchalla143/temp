Admission Date:  [**2160-10-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2160-10-30**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 81-year-old male is admitted to the Coronary Care Unit after a catheterization for inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction; status post ventricular fibrillation and post bradycardia during catheterization.
He had a catheterization and stent placement in [**2149**].
When the pain persisted through early this a.m., he presented to [**Hospital1 **], received aspirin, metoprolol, and nitroglycerin for inferior ST elevations and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination on admission revealed temperature was 95, heart rate was 63, blood pressure was 83/44, respiratory rate was 18, oxygen saturation was 95% on 6 liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed moist oral mucosa.
Neck examination with the patient supine, supple, no bruits.
Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count was 15.6, hematocrit was 44, platelets were 291.
INR was 4.5, PTT was 34.5.
Sodium was 139, potassium was 4,  chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was 16, creatinine was 1.6, and blood glucose was 152.
First creatine kinase was 3267, with a MB of 263.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Catheterization revealed pressures with right atrial mean was 8, right ventricular was 42/5, pulmonary artery was 41/21, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 22, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 30.
After percutaneous coronary intervention, the patient's cardiac enzymes trended downward.
He was also treated with metoprolol and captopril; which were titrated up to blood pressure and pulse tolerance.
This demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% to 45%, moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function, with inferior and lateral hypokinesis to akinesis.
He was to discuss with his cardiologist the option of returning to [**Hospital1 1444**] for a catheterization and left circumflex stent placement.
