He returned to [**Location **] on [**11-26**] septic - with fevers, white count of 27, neck pain, and pus from operative site.
MRI showed no definite focal collection in the soft tissues or epidural space, although it was a poor study.
Nonetheless, emergent I&D was performed with 6 L washout of infected lumbar wound, wound cultures sent which later grew out MRSA, no CSF taken as dura was intact, and two lumbar drains placed and hemovac applied.
Antibiotics switched to vanc/zosyn (starting on [**11-26**] and [**11-27**] respectively) with improvement in WBC (27->20->12->normal on transfer to floor today).
EKG at the time showed JP elevations in V1-V3 with poor R wave progression.
Potassium was repleted.

Washout of wound was performed on [**11-26**], dura was intact and wound cultures grew staph aureus sensitive to vanc and corynebacterium.
Blood cultures were positive for MRSA.
The patient's sputum culture grew out coag + staph aureus, and he was treated for presumed MRSA pneumonia.
A urine culture came back positive for [**Month/Year (2) **] with 10k - 100k organisms / ml; however upon changing the foley the enterococcus bacterial count decreased to [**2185**] organisms/ml without treatment indicating bacterial colonization with [**Year (4 digits) **] and not true UTI.
His hypoxia was likely multifactorial and due to pulmonary edema from [**Month/Year (2) 9215**] and volume overload, presumed MRSA pneumonia, atelectasis, and COPD exacerbation.
Repeated CXRs shows bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the left, left lower lobe atelectasis and pulmonary edema.
His sputum culture grew coag + staph aureus, presumed MRSA pneumonia is adequately covered by vancomycin.
The patient is volume overloaded on exam and has [**Last Name (LF) 9215**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was diuresed with good effect on respiratory status, although diuresis was limited by kidney function.
The patient does not have a previous diagnosis of COPD, but he has an extensive smoking history and his exam is concerning for underlying COPD.
Hypoxia improved and creatinine trended down.
On exam his abdomen was tense, distended and tympanic throughout with hyperactive bowel sounds.
Serial KUBs showed distended loops of colon.
GI recommended electrolyte repletion and serial rectal exams with stimulation to produce BMs.
# Anemia: Patient with gradual hemoglobin drop requiring transfusion of 7 units of PRBCs through course of hospitalization ([**12-5**], [**12-6**], [**12-9**], [**12-20**], [**12-31**] x2, [**1-4**]).
There were no signs of hemolysis and no active source of bleeding was found on examination, serial guaics, or CT abdomen / pelvis.
Hypoxia improved and creatinine trended down.
Creatinine elevated from his baseline starting hospital day 5.
Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal failure, likely due to decreased effective circulating volume due to [**Last Name (un) 9215**].
Diuresis attempted, however his Cr increased from 1.1 to 1.3 and his BUN increased to 29.
Muddy brown casts seen on light microscopy on [**12-10**] suggestive of ATN.
Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis.
Hypoxia improved and creatinine trended down.
Creatinine 0.9 on discharge.
He was started on heparin gtt and his PTT on [**12-9**] was 73.3.
He showed some LUE swelling on [**12-8**], but a LUE ultrasound showed no evidence of thrombus.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with PACs afterwards without intervention.
He was continuously monitored on telemetry after this episode and remained in normal sinus rhythm.
There were no significant EKG changes and trop t was 0.12 and 0.13.
PE unlikely given lack of tachycardia, hypoxia, EKG changes and negative LENIs.
Troponin negative on admission, was 0.11-0.16 on [**11-15**] (likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of acute infection), with no subsequent troponins drawn since until this episode so elevation may be residual.
Repeat culture showed continued enterococcus colonization, but patient without signs of active infection at that point.
Foley changed by urology, repeat culture at time of discharge was positive for enterococcus.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Last vancomycin trough was 19.3 ([**2198-1-6**]) on dose of 1000 mg IV Q48h.
# Urine grew [**Date Range **], thought to be colonization rather than true infection.
Foley changed, repeat urine culture at discharge still positive for enterococcus.
