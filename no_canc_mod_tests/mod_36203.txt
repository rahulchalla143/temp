An echocardiogram in [**2116-1-9**] with mild LVH, left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

ECHO ([**2121-11-20**]) Findings  LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Brief Hospital Course: This [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman was admitted to the General Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain.
A CT scan, as well as physical exam and history all pointed towards an ischemic colon with portal venous gas evident on the imaging.
A stat head CT ordered as per neurology didn't show any interval change.
Repeated head CTs showed an unchanged right subdural hematoma, with mass effect, but no shift of midline structures or herniation.
An ECG showed ST-segment depressions in V4/V5.
BP then 140/80.Trop peaked at 0.13.
Cardiology was consulted and it was felt that he would benefit form PPM placement, which would allow for better control of his ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
Hydralazine 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: One (1)  Injection Q2HRS () as needed for prn SBP > 160.
Followup Instructions: Please call the office of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] / neurosurgeon to be seen in 2 weeks ( on or about [**2121-12-3**] ) with a CT scan of the brain to evaluate your sub dural collection.
