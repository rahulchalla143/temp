She underwent IR guided tap on [**12-25**] where 3.5L were removed and sent for culture (received Albumin 62.5 grams) On [**12-27**], another 1.5L of fluid was removed and pt was given albumin 25 grams.
Today, she is undergoing an echo to evaluate right heart pressures as part of an evaluation for TIPs.

ECHO [**2146-12-29**]: No pulmonary hypertension.
ECHO [**2147-1-7**]: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-12-29**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is increased and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
No evidence of SBP and cultures taken from ostomy bag over leaking site showing diptheroids were likely due to contaminants.
Cell count from ostomy bag on [**12-31**] was negative for SBP.
TIPS was put on hold (patient not encephalopathic, with normal RUQ ultrasound and ECHO but elevated TBili, making TIPS procedure more risky).
A repeat Cardiac ECHO showed increased MR ([**1-14**]+ and higher PA pressures) concerning for worsening fluid overload.
A short-term interval followup ultrasound is recommended.
Blood products were adminitstered.
Hematocrit stabilized.
CVVHD was continued for volume overload until renal function improved with urine output increasing to ~ 1-1.5 liters/day.
Last CVVHD was done on [**1-26**].
A few staples were removed and a wound vac placed, but this did not hold suction therefore a dressing was applied.
An echo was done noting a wall motion abnormality possibly related to an old infarct.
Stool was sent for c.diff and was negative x3.
Daily trough levels were done with levels acceptable at 10.5-11.
