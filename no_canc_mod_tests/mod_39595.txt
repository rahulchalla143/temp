BP 188/104 L, 150/80 right.
CT ordered at 20:55, done and interpreted by 21:20.
FSBG 111.
Systolic blood pressures in 160s.
Patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU with post-tPA protocol orders and placed on neosynephrine to keep SBP 160-170 range x 36 hrs.
Repeat head CT's after t-PA showed no evidence of bleeding, thus he was placed on a full aspirin.
Then, on [**2179-1-2**], head CT showed a stroke on the right, less than one-half of the hemisphere, thus it was decided to start him on low dose heparin gtt and coumadin with a goal PTT 40-50.
Prior to angiograph, TTE was done and showed no PFO and no shunt.
He passed a swallow study in the ICU and thus may eat solid foods.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 60-70%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Air bubble contrast imaging did not demonstrate the presence of right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum, but the study is technically suboptimal.
[**2179-12-31**]:  No definite intracranial hemorrhage is seen on this study performed 90 minutes after a contrast-enhanced study.
Contrast enhancement limits evaluation for subtle intra or extra-axial hemorrhage.
CT angio head [**2179-12-31**]: 1.
His blood pressure was maintained with neosynephrine while in the ICU.
CT angio revealed right ICA occlusion.
(Patient cannot have MRI 2o2 srapnel).
Angiography  on [**2180-1-1**] showed right ICA dissection with pseudoaneurysm.
ESR 5, [**Doctor First Name **] pending.
Upon transfer to the floor, florinef was started to keep SBP > 120.
