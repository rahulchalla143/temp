His hematocrit remained stable.
A therapeutic tap of 1500mL of serosanguinous fluid was done because he desaturated to 89% on RA.

No CT evidence to suggest acute major vascular territorial infarction, though if clinical suspicion is high for this entity, MRI would be more a superior diagostic imaging study.
Cardiac silhouette has enlarged in the interim, but not appreciably.
[**9-27**] CT chest: 1.
Further evaluation with ultrasound (patient has a pacemeaker) is recommended as this lesion was not entirely imaged on this study.

There was no identifiable infection on blood cultures, CXRs, or urinalysis.
His  EEG did not show any seizures.
An LP was not performed as clinical suspicion was low.
# PLEURAL EFFUSION - His first thoracentesis removed 1.5 L but the pleural fluid removed was not sent for diagnostic testing.
The differential for the effusion was CHF versus malignancy but it seemed less likely to be CHF given normal systolic function seen on ECHO [**9-19**].
Fluid analysis was suggestive of transudate with LDH ratio of 0.3, total protein ratio of 0.3, fluid LDH of 185.
There was concern for a malignant pleural effusion, possibly secondary to a mesothelioma not visualized on chest CT due to the large pleural effusions.
At the time of discharge, the denied shortness of breath, had no other evidence on exam to suggest CHF besides pleural effusions, and had good O2 saturations on minimal O2 requirements.
Fluid cytology was pending at the time of discharge and patient's PCP was notified to follow up the results.
# BACTEREMIA - He had a coagulase neg staph grow out of 1 of 4 culture bottles on [**2110-9-17**] that was believed to be most likely a contaminant.
All subsequent cultures were negative and he remained afebrile without leukocytosis throughout admission.
However, cardiology reviewed the EKGs and did not feel that the EKG changes were consistent with acute coronary syndrome.
His EEG did not show any evidence of seizure activity.
# SPEECH AND SWALLOW - He was evaluated by speech and swallow.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
Right Perinephric/Paranephric Hemorrhage 2.
You should also discuss with him the labs results from your last thoracentesis while in the hospital.
