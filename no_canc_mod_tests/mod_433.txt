Her labs were significant for CK elevation to [**Numeric Identifier 2566**] without renal failure.
Her EKG was unchanged from prior.
Head CT showed small (<4.5mm) L frontal area that was possibly SDH vs calcium.

#Positive Troponins/NSTEMI- On morning of [**4-3**] the patient complained of vague abdominal pain and EKG was carried out with cardiac enxymes.
Troponin was found to be positive at 1.2 with CK index of 2.4.
Her EKG was hard to assess for ST changes given chronic left bundle branch block.Her vitals remained stable and her troponin remained between 1.2-1.35.
During the afternoon on [**4-3**] the patient went into atrial fibrilliation with RVR to 140's and responded to 2 pushes of 5mg metoprolol and 10mg diltiazam to rate controlled idioventricular rhythym in the 60's with BP 150/80's and 100% oxygenation on RA.
The patient was noted to be unresponsive a few hours later for few minutes , blood sugars were normal, neurological exam was nonfocal,abdominal exam benign with no distension, only insp crackles diffusley was observed, vitals were stable (including systolic BP above 150, afebrile, without tachycardia), the patient became more responsive but still delirious after 5 minutues.
ABG at the time showed no carbon dioxide retention or hypoxemia but was remarkable for lactate of 4.
Her INR continued to be elevated off coumadin for unclear reasons, perhaps acute liver failure.
Her LFT's and CK were trending down significantly while on the floor and she had normal liver ultrasound with patent vasculature.
# Acute on Chronic  systolic heart failure : Her recent EF was approximately 40% last month.However a echocrdiogram on [**3-28**] showed a EF of 20% with global hypokinesis and no coronary distribution.
Given 40mg and 80mg lasix bolus's on [**4-3**], negative 400cc as of [**4-3**] 6PM.
Successfully treated with IV fluids, and creatinine normalized with good urine output on transfer to the floor [**4-3**].
# Hyperdense brain lesion: Her CT head in the ER showed a small <4.5 mm hyperdense focus in the L frontal area which could be small SDH or calcium deposition.
Initially, this was presumed due to flash pulmonary edema as she was hypertensive and CXR appeared to be consistent.
However, in the morning her urine output was minimal, her hematocrit/CBC appeared very hemoconcentrated, her lactate was rising and her 02 sats were >94% on RA.
The patient's creatinine increased from 1.0 to 1.4 in the first day in the ICU.
Her urine was spun and was consistent with ATN.
Her CK trended down from 50,000 to 30,000 over the first day in the ICU.
Her creatinine peaked at 2.4 and then started to trend down and her urine output increased.
The patient' hematocrit also decreased from 47 to 34 after the 5L IVF and bicarb.
However, her INR was supratherapeutic at 4.5 so she was monitored closely for bleeding.
Repeat HCTs were 32-37 and she had no further signs of bleeding.
C. Diff came back negative x1, but the suspician was still high so Vanco and Flagyl were continued and Cipro was added (patient listed allergy to levofloxacin was GI upset).
She had a CT abdomen (with PO contrast only given acute renal failure), this showed no acute process and no signs of colitis, and 2 more C. Diff were negative so cipro, flagyl and PO vanco were stopped.
She also had blood and urine cultures sent that were negative.
However, given the acute onset of the AMS and the patient's supratherapeutic INR head CT was performed and showed no acute process.
It was difficult to control her rate with IV dilt, IV metoprolol because her pressures became low.
EP recommended digoxin loaded which improved her rates into low 100s.
The team rate controlled the atrial fibrillation but approximately 8-12 hours later she suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and was transported back to the ICU.
