CP became very severe and  was similar to CP (SSCP with radiation to right shoulder) with his previous MI so he presented to the ED.
Patient presented in [**9-21**] with complaints of excertional chest pain similar to his chest pain prior to his MI in [**2181**].
He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5076**] in clinic and underwent cardiac cath on [**2185-9-29**] that showed a totally occluded LAD and 80%.
Potassium was 6.8, but hemolyzed.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: (+) HTN  (+) CHOL (+) Borderline DM 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Colon Cancer: [**2181**] s/p resection, radiation and chemotherapy - COPD - Lower back Arthritis - Tonsillectomy - Hernia - h/o train accident right arm disability.

Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CXR: [**2185-12-21**]: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Linear opacity projecting over the region of the proximal SVC and left brachiocephalic vein which may be artifactual versus retained catheter, not seen in the prior CT study (CT [**2183-5-13**]).
Clinical correlation advised and repeat imaging as warranted.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
CK and CKMB peaked at 5122 and > 500 respectively.
Post cath ECHO showed EF of 30-35% with moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction.
He was discharged on lovenox to complete bridge to therapeutic INR goal of [**2-15**].
Impaired glucose tolerance: Finger sticks monitored QACHS throughout hospital stay; patient placed on sliding scale insulin as needed to maintain euglycemia.
A HA1C was pending at the time of discharge  4.
Of note, metoprolol tartrate was switched to long acting form during hospital stay and uptitrated as tolerated by blood pressure to maintain optimal heart rate.
Lipid panel at goal with LDL < 70 and HDL of 41.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check your INR on [**2185-12-27**] via your VNA and call results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3070**] 14.
You will have your INR checked w/ goal 1.8-2.5.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
You will need to have your coumadin level checked frequently and keep the level between 1.8 and 2.5.
