On evaluation of her pill bottles, it appears as though she took Zyprexa and Adderall.
She was found minimally responsive by her husband at 2pm on [**2108-3-18**] who called EMS.
Tox screen was negative for benzos, cocaine, tricyclics, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, asa, small amt + of tylenol at 1.7.
Initial EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at [**Street Address(2) 65762**] depressions in V1 and diffuse ST elevations with PR depressions.
In terms of her overdose, poison control was contact[**Name (NI) **] and patient was monitered for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which was of concern with her Zyprexa overdose, but did not exhibit any of these signs.
EKG on 2nd day of hospitalization demonstrated ST elevations in lateral leads which were more pronounced than on admission.
Hospital course otherwise notable for some hypoxia with borderline O2 sats on 100% FiO2- CXR at that time demonstrated some evidence of aspiration pna and ?CHF.
Also had abd CT negative, Chest CT demonstrated LUL nodule which was monitered.
Had recent scan that demonstrated increase in size of LUL nodule from 3mm->7mm, PET scan in [**12-11**] negative - scheduled to have repeat Chest CT this month.

Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with patent LMCA, LAD that had mild 30% mid vessel lesion, LCx that was without obstructive disease and the RCA had a mid vessel 60% lesion.
Hemodynamic assessment showed low normal RAp, elevated PaP with marked respiratory variation and normal PCWP.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to extensive apical akinesis, with contractile function improving toward the base of the heart.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.

Her sputum and Bcx (1 out of 4) from admission grew out MSSA.
No history of CAD and per OSH records, had recent cardiac w/u which was negative.
EKG on initial presentation to OSH demonstrates diffuse ST elevation and PR depression.
EKG on day of transfer demonstrates anterolateral ST elevation with reciprical inferior changes.
ECHO [**3-20**] demonstrated LV systolic dysfxn with EF 20-30% [**2-9**] extensive apical akinesis, also 3+ MR.
Will need a BB and ACEI once BP stable and as BP tolerates.
Seen by poison control at OSH - monitered for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which were not noted.
Repleted lytes K to 4 and mag to 2. .
Psychiatry felt that the patient was safe to discharge home with her attending a day program at [**Hospital 882**] hospital and in addition to having regular meetings with her therapist, which she agreed to and was arranged.
She was continued on IV oxacillin and was changed to Levofloacin on discharge - since her bacteremia was also succeptible to this antibiotics.
She did not spike any fevers while on the floor and surveillance blood cultures were negative from [**3-20**] and [**3-22**].
Follow up urine cultures were also negative.
On discharge, her SBP rose to 108.
(Lipid panel showed LDL of 54 and HDL of 43) .
During her stay on the floor, she was walked with PT and her oxygen requirements were weaned down slowly; on discharge patient was completely off of oxygen and was comfortable.
Repeat CXR on [**3-26**] showed resolution of her pulmonary edema.
In addition, patient will need basic oncologic screening - in particular, her pulmonary nodule will need follow up - per Radiology here at [**Hospital1 **], it was recommended that this nodule be followed up in [**3-12**] months with repeat CT. - For her depressed EF, she will need a follow up ECHO, particularly in the event that she may have a depressed EF due to myocardial stress  Medications on Admission: Outside medications (per OSH records): Percocet 5/325 q6hr PRN Zyprexa ?2.5mg qd Prozac 60mg QD Inderal - recently d/ced HCTZ - recently d/ced Topomax Nexium 40mg QD Premarin 0.625mg QD .
