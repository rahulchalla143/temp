[**2168-5-3**] Carotid duplex scan : < 40% stenoses B/L ICA's   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Trauma team in the Emergency Room along with the Ortho Trauma service for her multiple broken bones.
Her accident was possibly caused by a syncopal episode therefore she needed a cardiac echo and carotid duplex scan to rule out any abnormalities.
Her Cardiac echo revealed a normal EF, no wall motion abnormalities and no significant valvular disease.
Her carotid studies showed a < 40% stenoses in bilateral ICA's.
Her blood pressure was on the high side but after her pain was controlled and her routine antihypertensives were resumed she was in better control.
Her hematocrit was stable in the 23-24 range without any blood transfusions.
her blood sugars were elevated but in better control after resuming her diabetic medications.
The Physical Therapy service evaluated her to try to increase her mobility although her weight along with her activity restrictions were limiting.
