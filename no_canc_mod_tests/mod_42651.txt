Her blood pressure was up in the 150/80 range; this was checked by her sister, who was an R.N.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was significant for a prosthetic mitral valve and aortic valve, both Bjork-Shiley valves implanted in [**2126**] secondary to rheumatic heart disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, atrial fibrillation since [**2125**], endocarditis in [**2130**], a motor vehicle accident in [**2123**] with a pinched cervical nerve suffered from that accident, a cardiac catheterization in [**2132-8-17**] with no intervention and a history of fibroid tumors.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 95/59, a heart rate in the 60s, a respiratory rate of 19 and an oxygen saturation of 97% on one liter.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, the sclerae were anicteric and noninjected.
The cardiovascular examination revealed a regular mechanical S1 and S2.
LABORATORY DATA:  There was a sodium of 140, potassium of 3.2, chloride of 97, bicarbonate of 27, BUN of 14, creatinine of 0.8 and glucose of 124.
Calcium was 9.2, magnesium was 2.0 and phosphate was 3.8.
CK was 38.
There was a white blood cell count of 11,800, hematocrit of 34.3 and platelet count of 330,000.
Prothrombin time was 24, partial thromboplastin time was 39.4 and INR was 3.8.
RADIOLOGY:  A chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no overt pulmonary edema.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 75 and diffuse small ST segment depressions in II, V5 and V6, inferolateral.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medicine service for rule out myocardial infarction with a plan to reverse her INR and then repeat her cardiac catheterization.
She had an echocardiogram done on the day of admission, which showed an aortic gradient of 35 and a mitral valve gradient of 16, both increased from the prior month's echocardiogram.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2133-6-19**] and the catheterization showed normal coronary arteries except for a 30% ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery with moderate to severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
At the time of transfer, her heart rate was 90, atrially paced, and her blood pressure was 115/62 with a central venous pressure of 16 and a pulmonary artery pressure of 88/38 with a mean of 57.
Of note, her INR was slow to respond to her being started back on her Coumadin and, from postoperative day #3 through #7, her Coumadin dose was gradually increased.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT TRANSFER:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of 97.4?????
?F, a heart rate of 83 with atrial flutter, a blood pressure of 111/83, a respiratory rate of 18 and an oxygen saturation of 97% on two liters.
Weight preoperatively was 101.6 kg; at discharge, it was 100 kg.
Breath sounds were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart sounds were regularly irregular, S1 and S2, with a positive mechanical click.
LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER:  There was a white blood cell count of 8800, hematocrit of 26, prothrombin time of 18.6, INR of 2.3 and partial thromboplastin time of 69 on heparin at 800 units/hour.
There was a sodium of 141, potassium of 4.7, chloride of 99, bicarbonate of 32, BUN of 13, creatinine of 0.7 and glucose of 97.
Heparin 800 units per hour until she reaches her goal INR of 2.5 to 3.
Aortic valve replacement, Bjork-Shiley, done in [**2126**].
