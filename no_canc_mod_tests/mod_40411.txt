Vitals were HR 98 BP 176/110 and Sat 99% RA.
First set of enzymes at OSH were negative.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2116-5-22**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Echocardiogram [**2116-9-14**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-7-19**], there are more extensive wall motion abnormalities (suggestive of interim LAD ischemia/infarction).
The degree of aortic stenosis may be underestimated on the current study (low output - low gradient aortic stenosis).
Cardiac Catherization [**2116-9-15**]: Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel disease.
The distal LAD filled via the LIMA and was a small, 1.5mm vessel with diffuse disease and a 60-70% apical stenosis that was unchanged from the catheterization of 6/[**2115**].
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated left-sided filling pressures with LVEDP 32mmHg.
The systemic arterial blood pressure was normal with SBP 107mmHg and DBP 52mmHg.
Markedly elevated left-sided filling pressures  CXR [**2116-9-19**] A right subclavian PICC line is present.
Discharge Labs: 138  104  29 --------------< 127 4.2  27  1.1  Ca: 8.6 Mg: 1.9 P: 3.2  5.6 > 11.8/33.7 <  193  PT: 22.8  PTT: 72.3  INR: 2.2   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 12163**] is an 86yo male with HTN, DM, HLD and extensive history of CAD s/p CABG as well as severe AS, who was admitted to the CCU with the diagnosis of  NSTEMI: No EKG changes suggestive of ST-elevation on admission; CK peaked at 566 and CKMB peaked at 64.
He was medically managed for his NSTEMI with a heparin drip, metoprolol, lisinopril, crestor, plavix, and full dose ASA.
On [**2116-9-14**] an echocardiogram showed an interval decrease in his EF from [**2113**] of 50% to 25-30%.
The echocardiogram also demonstrated a new left ventricular aneurysm.
This prompted investigation of whether the LIMA to LAD graft from his bypass was still patent as it was in 6/[**2115**].
WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: As noted above, on [**2116-9-15**] the patient complained of chest pain and was noted to have a wide complex tachycardia with heart rate in the 140s that resolved with IV lopressor.
The patient was bridged on warfarin therapy with goal INR of [**1-8**] due to new LV aneurysm and the inability to exclude a clot.
His INR at discharge was 2.2. .
On [**2116-9-17**] the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 27 from 34.
He was transfused 1 unit of blood and responded appropriately and his hematocrit remained stable for the remainder of his hospital course.
The patient's blood glucose was well controlled with the sliding scale.
We did various studies of your heart and did not think that there were new areas of blockage to your coronary arteries.

Please call to schedule an appointment for the week of [**2116-9-21**] to have your INR checked to ensure that your Coumadin dose is correct.
