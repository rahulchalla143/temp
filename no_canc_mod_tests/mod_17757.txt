Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2180-12-7**]: ICP monitor placement [**2180-12-7**]: Successful placement of an 8 French percutaneous right transhepatic internal-external biliary drain (PCT).
Originally thought to be in CHF at OSH and treated with Lasix 40mg IV, and was also thought to have an infiltrate on CXR concerning for PNA.
However, labs at OSH showed elevated LFTs and bilirubin 2.6.
An abdominal US and MRCP were done, which showed mildly dilated intra-hepatic ducts that could be consistent with prior Whipple.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of possible cholagitis.
CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.8 in [**2177**]) 3. chronic atrial fibrillation ?

IMAGING: [**2180-12-6**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST: 1.
Differential considerations include hemorrhagic metastases versus hemorrhagic pseudocyst vs amorphous calcification/debris in pancreatic duct, although no ductal dilatation.
Further evaluation with MRCP is advised.
Close interval followup and further clinical evaluation is recommended.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-12-7**], biventricular systolic function is improved.
[**2180-12-14**] Tube Cholangiogram/CHALNAGIOGRAPHY: Cholangiogram performed through the existing biliary catheter showed the catheter to be in a satisfactory position and draining well.
A minor adjustment was made to the catheter position by pushing it in by about a centimeter.
Abdominal CT revealed high density material in the CBD and projecting over the pancreatic neck and body, question of stones, calcification.
Patient takes coumadin at home for history of atrial fibrillation, arriving with INR 2.9.
He was intubated, sedated and still hemodynamically very unstable so a Head CT was unable to be obtained at this point.
An ICP monitor bolt placed with an opening ICP of 20mm.
On [**2180-12-10**], the [**Last Name (un) 8745**] bolt was removed, and a Head CT performed, which showed no intracranial hemorrhage, but probable chronic small-vessel infarction.
PT/INR should be checked daily at Rehab facility until therapeutic; INR goal 2.5 with a therapeutic range of [**1-17**].
Thereafter, the patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
A dobhoff was placed, and tubefeeds started on [**2180-12-11**], which were continued until [**2180-12-16**], when discontinued and the dobhoff removed.
The patient underwent a swallow evaluation, and was started on a renal diet on [**12-18**]/201, which he tolerated.
In 1 month, the patient will have a repeat PTBD cholangiogram with possible diliation as an outpatient.
ID: Admitted with septic shock, with Blood culture at OSH with strep bovis/clostridium clostriforme, blood cultures here were negative.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Staples on scalp from previous bolt removed prior to discharge.
The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.
Hematology: While hospitalized, the patient received 10 units of FFP, most of which were given initially upon admission to correct his INR before emergent PTBD placement.
He received 1 unit PRBCs on [**2180-12-18**] for a HCT 23.0/HGB 7.4 during CVVH.
Pre-discharge HCT 23.9 /HGB 8.1 on [**2180-12-22**] for which one unit was transfussed during dialysis prior to discharge.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1.
Cholangitis 2.
Septic shock secondary to strep bovis and clostridium clostridiiforme bacteremia 3.
