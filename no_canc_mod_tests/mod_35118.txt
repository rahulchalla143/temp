[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral valvular regurgitation.]
Post CPB: The cardiac output is 4L/min on a phenylephrine infusion and A-paced.
His bypass time was 119 minutes with a crossclamp of 102 minutes.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring in stable condition.
