FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-28**], there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild fullness of pulmonary vessels consistent with some increased pulmonary venous pressure.
She also had some signs of mild fluid overload with mild pulmonary edema on CXR and lower extremity edema, she received few doses of IV lasix to assist in mild diureses with good effect as well.
Her BNP was 627 on admission making flagrant CHF much less likely.
He fluid overload was possibly due to some level of diastolic dysfunciton as her recent EF was >75%.
She was restarted on her home COPD regimen and maintained on her home 02 of 2L NC with a goal O2 sat between 88-92%.
Furthermore, LENIS were checked for a low suspicion of a PE and they were negative.
Hypertension: On admission her blood pressure did not require the administration of her antihypertensive medications.
As her blood pressure rose, they were slowly titrated back on, starting with her Norvasc 10mg PO daily and a half dose of her lisinopril (20mg PO daily) and her home dose of lasix at 20mg PO daily.
Begin scale at Blood glucose of 150, start with 2 units of humalog and increase by 2 units of insulin per 50 increase in blood glucose (for example 4 units insulin for Blood glucose of 200, 6 units for blood glucose of 250, etc).
