Microbiology:    RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2183-2-8**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Suboptimal evaluation of subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches due to patient respiratory motion.
Indeterminate 12 mm left adrenal nodule; further workup with an MRI or dedicated adrenal CT is recommended if clinically warranted.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
EKG on admission: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
EKG during admission: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and increase in rate as compared with previous tracing of [**2183-2-4**].
The cause of his arrest was most likely ischemic, given the wall motion abnormalities found on echocardiogram and the rising troponins.
The Artic Sun therapeutic cooling protocol was initiated, electrolytes were repleted as necessary, and a continuous video EEG was taken.
His rapid ventricular rate may have also been due to an infective process as described below.
The sputum grew large amounts of MSSA and the other cultures did not grow anything at the time of this summary.
