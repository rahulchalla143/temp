CT abdomen/pelvis showed massively distended bladder and bilateral hydronephrosis.
EKG reported showed "peaked T waves."
During his time on the Medicine Service, he was given antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection, provided electrolyte supplementation and fluids, provided a diabetic diet, and monitored for improvement of uremic symptoms, kidney function, and acid-base status.
CT showed massively distended bladder and bilateral hydronephrosis in the setting of likely BPH and recent use of opiates for back pain.
Foley catheter was placed to relieve the obstruction and patient's creatinine trended down from 27.4 on presentation to 1.2 on discharge.
ECG revealed peaked T-waves.
The patient's potassium trended down to 3.5.
A repeat EKG did not find any further abnormalities.
On exam he displayed asterixis and inattentiveness when asked to state the months of the year backwards.
Leukocytosis: Given the results of the urine culture and the urinalysis with lack of pyuria, the patient remained at low suspicion of urinary tract infection, and was thus taken off ceftriaxone, which was initially given for concern of UTI.
Simvastatin had been on hold since two days prior, and CK-MB and troponin were negative.
The patient's blood sugars gradually trended down from 344 to 167 by the end of the stay.
Patient should keep his f/u appointment with urologist for evaluation of his prostate, and opiates and anticholinergic meds should be avoided until prostate health is managed.
