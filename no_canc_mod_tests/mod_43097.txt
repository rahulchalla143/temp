On arrival in the Emergency Department, his blood pressure was noted to be 247/132 and on repeat and found to be 250/140.
A Nipride drip was started, and the patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with blood pressure under better control at 170/119.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed the patient's temperature was 95.4 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 82, his noninvasive blood pressure was 220/120, respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no rales.
The patient's first heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Relevant laboratory studies revealed the patient had a white blood cell count on admission of 14.3.
His hematocrit was 48.7.
His platelets were 324.
On chemistry panel sodium was 133, potassium was 5.4, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen was 23, creatinine was 1.1, and his blood glucose was 123.
Liver function tests were done and were all normal.
His oxygen saturations fell into the high 80s.
Despite increase in oxygen requirements, the patient was placed on a nonrebreather and still had an oxygen saturation of approximately 89%.
A blood gas was done and showed 7.48, PCO2 of 31, and PO2 of 49.
The oxygen saturation did not improve.
The blood pressure, therefore, decreased to approximately 80 systolic which was corrected wit fluid boluses and some dopamine and discontinuation of the Nipride drip.
On a chest x-ray repeated the next day, there were signs of bilateral diffuse infiltrates suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome likely due to the aspiration of gastric contents.
The patient's blood pressure continued to require pressors for blood pressure support.
