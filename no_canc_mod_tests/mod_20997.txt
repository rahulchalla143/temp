She was found to have oxygen saturation in the 80s, and was hypertensive.
Her blood pressure decreased to the 80s/50s and 60s/40s.
At that point, dopamine was started and her blood pressure increased in the 120s-160s/50s.
Chest x-ray in the ED revealed a right lower lobe and left retrocardiac opacity and possible congestive heart failure.
Eventually, her blood pressures stabilized in the 140s-160s systolic and oxygen saturation were 90% on 70% face mask.
At that point, she was admitted to the VICU for further evaluation and treatment.
EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile, blood pressure 147/38, heart rate 79, oxygen 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 13.7, hematocrit 43.3, platelets 319.
Chemistries:  Sodium 137, potassium 4.2, chloride 100, bicarb 23, BUN 26, creatinine 1.3, glucose 214.
CK 69, troponin 0.02.
PT 12.4, PTT 22.7, INR 1.0, lactate 2.4.
Repeat EKG showed sinus rhythm at [**Street Address(2) 55868**] changes resolved.
By [**2121-6-5**], her lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally, and she no longer felt short of breath.
Cardiac:  Patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and her EKG on admission showed ST changes in the setting of hypertension and tachycardia.
However, the patient did have elevated cardiac enzymes with troponins of 0.02, 0.12, and 0.07.
Further cardiac issues included new onset of atrial fibrillation on [**2121-6-3**].
This is also important as her echocardiogram showed severe pulmonary hypertension and patient should also be anticoagulated for this reason.
Complete echocardiogram result from [**2121-5-30**] showed the left atrium to be moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity size was normal and overall left ventricular ejection fraction was greater than 55%.
The patient will need a repeat echocardiogram in [**5-6**] weeks to determine her baseline PA pressures once her congestive heart failure has completely resolved.
Her hematocrit was followed closely during the admission, and she required no blood transfusion.
Blood pressure:  Patient was initially hypertensive and then hypotensive on admission.
However, her blood pressure quickly stabilized, and she was well controlled throughout the remainder of admission.
