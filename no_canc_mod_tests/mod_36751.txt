TTE was checked on [**2154-8-9**] what showed EF=35-30% (decrement from prior studies) with multiple wmas, 3+ MR, 2+ TR.
This TTE showed EF=20% with significant dyssynchrony (with tissue doppler), multiple wma's (including a dyskinetic apex with akinesis of parts of the anterior wall), 2+ MR.  She also had her PM interrogated on [**8-13**] (found to be functioning adequately).

ECG: Atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm at a rate of 60.  .
TO of SVG-RCA, 40% tubular lesion of SVG-)M2, HK of anterior wall    Brief Hospital Course: 81F CAD, HTN, PPM admitted to MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and shock of unknown etiology, now thought to be cardiogenic in nature since an infectious work up was unrevealing.
CXR, Chest CT and abdominal CT showed no source of infection and pt.
She had leukocytosis of 12.6 upon admission to the MICU and blood cultures were significant for 1/4 bottles of gram positive cocci in clusters, Coagulase (-).
A cardiogenic cause of shock was also pursued and an [**Date Range 113**] done in the MICU revealed an EF of 30% and focal hypo/akinesis of the apical free wall of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
Repeat TTE showed EF to be 20% with apical akinesis.
Given this new cardiomyopathy, she was taken for cardiac catheterization which revealed no new critical disease.
SPEP/UPEP/TSH/Fe studies were all within normal limits.
She was diuresed as possible and will need repeat TTE in 1 month.
Pt was transferred to the floor on 4 liters of oxygen with o2 saturation ranging from 94-97% and was agressively diuresed with Lasix 20 mg IV BID.
A repeat [**Last Name (un) 113**] was done on [**8-14**] and results are as above.
Once she was transferred to the floor, they were followed with serial labs and gradually decreased to AST 47 and ALT 97.

Creatinine remained stable throughout the remainder of the hospitalization  Disposition: Home with VNA services.
