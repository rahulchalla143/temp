She was sent to the Emergency Department on [**8-29**] for evaluation of fevers.
Vitals at this time showed a temperature of 100.8, respiratory rate in the 30s, systolic blood pressure in the 70s-90s, and she was therefore sent to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.
Her vital signs showed a systolic blood pressure in the 50s-60s, heart rate in 130s, and respiratory rate in the 40s.
An ABG was performed, which showed a pH of 7.31, pCO2 of 25, and a pO2 of 146 on 100% nonrebreather mask.
A lactate was 11.6.
A femoral Cordis was placed, and 4 liters of normal saline were given over two hours.
Her blood pressure remained in the 80s, so a dopamine drip was started with increase in her blood pressure to the 120s.
Chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe infiltrate and her urinalysis indicated a urinary tract infection.
She was also given a dose of Kayexalate for a potassium of 6.3.
Calcium carbonate.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vitals:  Temperature 91.4 axillary, heart rate 122, blood pressure 138/40, respiratory rate 29, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nonrebreather mask.
Back showed purpuric discoloration over the bilateral buttocks, flanks, and lateral thigh.
LABORATORIES:  Initial laboratories were significant for a white count of 39.2, hematocrit of 38.5, and platelets of 136.
The differential showed 25% bands.
PT was 16.5, PTT 32.8, INR of 1.8.
Chem-7:  Sodium 142, potassium 6.0, chloride 106, bicarb 10, BUN 60, creatinine 2.1, glucose 110 with an anion gap of 26, calcium 11.6, phosphate 5.7, magnesium 3.8.
AST 289, ALT 258, alkaline phosphatase 105, total bilirubin 0.9, amylase 93, lipase 18, albumin 3.
Urinalysis showed large blood, nitrite positive, 100 of protein, moderate leukocyte esterase, [**11-3**] RBC, greater than 50 WBC, and many bacteria.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 110, normal axis, and normal intervals.
Chest x-ray showed a left base infiltrate.
KUB showed a large amount of retained stool with nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
After a brief time off the dopamine, the patient's blood pressure again fell.
Pressor support was resumed at this time with levoephedrine, but there was a continued difficulty with maintaining a mean arterial pressure greater than 60.
