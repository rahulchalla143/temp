Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**10-20**] - AP single view of the chest demonstrates the presence of a left-sided PICC line seen to terminate overlying the SVC at the level 1 cm below the carina.
CT Abd [**10-16**]: 1.
Head CT [**10-16**]: 1.
No evidence of an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size on CT angiography of the head.
It should be noted that mycotic aneurysm in the peripheral branches of the intracranial arteries could not be excluded by CT angiography.
Carotid US [**10-19**]: No hemodynamically significant stenosis within the right or left internal carotid arteries.
Knee X-ray [**10-21**]: 1.
Cardiac Cath [**10-19**]: No coronary disease   Brief Hospital Course: 69 M with HTN, hyperlipidemia, IPF, Hep C, and psoriatic arthritis presenting with bacterial endocarditis and CHF exacerbation.
BACTERIAL ENDOCARDITIS - On presenation pt had a transesophageal echo showing tricuspid and aortic vegetations and severe aortic insufficiency.
Pt was initially treated with Vancomycin, Gentamicin (dosed by levels) and Zosyn and when OSH BCx grew nutritionally varient strept, was switched to Vancomycin, Gentamicin and Ceftriaxone.
Cultures were then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for reevaluation by our ID team regarding sensitivities for narrowing of antibiotics.
He had daily blood cultures for several days but all cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] were negative.
Pt was cleared for surgery with multiple pre-op screening tests including normal carotid ultrasound, head CT, cardiac cath and dental eval with panorex.
ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS - Pt initially had some RLQ tenderness and h/o BRBPR, so CT scan was done to look for possible source of bacteremia.
INTERSTITIAL PULMONARY FIBROSIS - Normal PFTs in [**2171**] and not on O2 at home.
He was evaluated with an x-ray showing effusion, osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis.
PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS - Pt's pain was controlled with tylenol .

You will need intravenous antibiotics for at least 6 weeks and a repeat echocardiogram to make sure the infection has cleared.
You had a carotic artery ultrasound to check for blockages, there were no significant blockages found.
You had a cardiac catheterization that showed no coronary artery disease.
You will need to be seen by cardiac surgery team after the antibiotics are finished and the ECHO is done to see if the bacteria have been cleared from your valves and if you need surgery to fix the aortic valve.
