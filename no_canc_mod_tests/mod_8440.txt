While in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient acutely desaturated with a pulse oximetry of 60%, was given a nebulizer treatment, non-rebreather mask and failed to improve with hypoxia in a range of pAO2 of 44.
The patient was on CPAP with a pressure support of 8 and PEEP of about 10 and FIO2 of 100, and her oxygen saturations improved to the 90s.
With the concern of her possible PE causing shunt, the patient was intubated on the third day of hospital stay for a CT scan.
The patient acutely desaturated with oxygen of 60s while on the vent prior to having the CT scan.
Multiple blood gases drawn showed pO2 in the 31 to 35 range.
The decision was made for an emergent bronchoscopy at the bedside where a mucous plug was discovered in the left main stem bronchus.
Once removed, the patient's oxygen saturations rapidly improved.
The patient was extubated the following day with oxygen saturations in the 95 to 96% on room air.
Ultrase 7 to 8 with meals, 3 to 4 with snacks.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 101.6 F.; blood pressure between 100 and 140 over 50 to 90; pulse between 70 and 145; the patient's respirations between 20 and 30.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rhonchi or crackles.
LABORATORY:  On [**2110-12-19**], white blood cell count of 5.4, hematocrit of 26.7, platelets of 150, neutrophils of 64.7, lymphocytes 30.4, monocytes 3.4, eosinophils 1.0, basophils 0.5.
Chemistry sodium 139, potassium 4.2, chloride 99, bicarbonate 27, BUN 18, creatinine 0.6, glucose 113, calcium 8.9, phosphorus 3.6, magnesium 1.4.
The patient had a CT scan of the chest which ruled out pulmonary embolism and showed diffuse air space and disease in the right lung and left lower lobe consistent with infection.
PULMONARY:  The patient is now status post stent placement with oxygen saturations in the mid-90s on two liters.
A CT angiogram showed no evidence of a pulmonary embolism.
Pan cultures show the patient has a likely source of pulmonary given the findings on chest x-ray and follow-up CT scan.
At the time of dictation, sputum Gram stain and culture were pending.
Blood sugars have been completely out of control given that the patient's p.o.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had an echocardiogram while she was at the [**Hospital1 69**].
A CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient has been very hypophosphatemic and hypomagnesemic treated with p.o.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   As per her Page One and to be determined by her physicians at [**Hospital3 1810**].
twice a day; note this level was changed from her usual 7 mg dose given that her trough levels were above standard.
Ultrase 7 to 8 with meals, 3 to 4 with snacks.
