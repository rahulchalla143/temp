Echo [**2182-8-2**] There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35%).
Right ventricular hypertrophy and enlargement raise suspicion of underlying pulmonary hypertension (not confirmed on this study), which may limit the sensitivity of echocardiographic evaluation for tamponade.
CXR [**2182-8-1**]: Large right pleural effusion has markedly increased.
CXR [**2182-8-14**]: Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions have decreased substantially.
TTE [**2182-8-5**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated left and right-sided filling pressure consistent with severe diastolic heart failure.
The cardiac output and cardiac index were preserved.
Preserved cardiac output and cardiac index.
Cath [**8-12**] showed elevated R and L-sided pressures but preserved CI and CO.  Due to progressive renal failure of his renal graft, he commenced HD via temporary catheter and had a tunnelled line placed for more durable access.
#Moderate Pericardial Effusion: Previously visualized but increased based on echo done this admission.
Pulsus 10mmHg, ECG shows mild electrical alternans.
Pt had bloody pericardial drainage with drain placement, felt to be [**1-17**] high INR (4).
Repeat echo showed resolution of the effusion.
#Respiratory distress: When pt was admitted he required several liters of 02 via face mask to maintain saturations in the low 90's.
CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.
Oxygen saturations improved following pericardial drainage and diuresis.
#Klebsiella sepsis: Pt had a positive blood culture and urine culture for Klebsiella, with the blood growing three pan-sensitive strains.
Coumadin was held intially as INR was supratherapeutic on admission, but resumed prior to d/c.
His INR was 3.3 on [**Hospital1 **] and had been increasing slowly over the past few days of hospitalization despite decreasing warfarin.
Will need 1mg daily with daily INR checks until stabilized.
#Renal Failure: He is s/p renal transplant 25 years ago for PKD and has a baseline creatinine of 1.6.
If no urine output increase noted over 2 weeks, he probably will discontinue cyclosporin.
Transitional Issues: - will need titration of warfarin for INR goal [**1-18**] - f/u with renal and transplant surgery - f/u with cardiology and CHF for volume management - HD MWF - Trial of cyclosporin 100mg daily for roughly 2 weeks.
Pending tests at [**Hospital1 **]: -none   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
