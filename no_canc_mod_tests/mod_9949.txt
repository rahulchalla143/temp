Presented to GI suite where pullback cholangiogram was performed which showed free passage of bile into jejunum without evidence of leak.
PET scan with multiple areas of FDG1 avidity concerning for malignancy # Cirrhosis - Thought to be secondary to PSC; complicated by esophageal varices - three cords with grade I varices - and splenomegaly (liver biopsy showed bridging fibrosis, but varices and splenomegaly suggestive of cirrhosis).
# S/p cholangiogram [**11-27**] which demonstrated irregular dilation and stricture of the left-sided intrahepatic bile duct with no communication to the right side.
Biliary drain placement in [**11-27**] with biopsies that revealed fibrosis, but no evidence of a tumor.

Pullback cholangiogram via the existing percutaneous biliary access into the left intrahepatic biliary duct demonstrated no dilatation of the left intrahepatic biliary duct, minimal filling of the nondilated side branches, and free passage of contrast past the biliary/enteric anastomosis.
[**4-10**] CT Abd/pelvis: 1.
A left-sided periductal cystic region has increased in size from prior exam as described above.
[**4-11**] CT Abd pelvis: 1.
[**4-13**] CXR: AP chest compared to 7:35 a.m. and [**4-12**].
The tip of the right apical pleural tube projects over a triangular lucent area, which is probably residual pleural space containing air, although hyperlucency in aerated lung apex distal to a row of suture could give exactly the same appearance.
[**4-19**] CT Abd/pelvis: 1.
This is stable when compared to prior studies and consistent with the history of PSC 3.
[**4-19**] CXR after removal of chest tube: Comparison to prior chest x-ray of [**2106-4-18**] at 11:38 a.m. shows no appreciable change in the appearance of the chest with a small persistent right apical pneumothorax .
Pullback cholangiogram via the existing percutaneous biliary access into the left intrahepatic biliary duct demonstrates no dilatation of the main left intrahepatic biliary ducts.
Appearances in the left lobe are mildly more prominent than earlier MRI of [**2104-10-7**].
# Abdominal pain:  Cholangiogram had no evidence of biliary leak as a possible cause of abdominal pain.
CT abdomen showed infectious vs. inflammatory colitis.
He continued to spike fevers and was subsequently started on Zosyn to increase gram negative coverage to cover Pseudomonas, and oral vancomycin for the possibility of C. diff resistant to Flagyl.
Repeat CT abdomen showed improvement in the inflammation.
Stool studies were negative for C. diff.
His exam improved and he was subsequently afebrile.
He subsequently underwent colonoscopy on [**4-20**] that showed chronic inflammation and esophageal varices, but no acute UC flare.
# Pneumothorax:  Spontaneous right pneumothorax was incidentally found on CT abdomen on [**4-11**].
Chest x-ray the next day showed stable residual small apical pneumothorax.
His elevated bilirubin gradually tranded down, but his alkaline phosphatase continued to trend up.
Eventually the T bili began to rise again as well, and he underwent a second cholangiogram with replacement of the biliary stent.
He had a colonoscopy and EGD with 6 biopsies taken.
His electrolytes were monitored and repleted prn.
