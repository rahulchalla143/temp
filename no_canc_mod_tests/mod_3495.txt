History of Present Illness: This 80 year old man with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica on chronic steroids and aortic stenosis that has been followed by serial echocardiograms for many years.
He is now being referred for cardiac catheterization to assess his aortic valve.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-2-6**], the aortic valve gradient is slightly higher.
