CT abd/pelvis: 1.
Follow-up with CXR is recommended.
Correlation with laboratory evaluation is advised to exclude pancreatitis.
Age-indeterminate compression fracture of the T8 vertebral body.
[**4-25**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**4-24**], the monitoring and support devices remain in place.
[**4-29**] ECHO: Saline bubble contrast study was performed with cough and Valsalva release as well as during rest.
Nondiagnostic study .
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The patient was intubated prior to transfer and initially required fairly heavy ventilatory support- AC FiO2 1.0 and PEEP 12 to keep sats in a good range.
It was thought that his hypoxia was related to a shunt phenomenon, due to the fact that his oxygen saturation did not change with large changes in his supplemental oxygen, a TTE was done that was non-diagnostic due to image quality and a CTA was done that ruled out a PE.
His oxygen requirement continued to decrease and on the day he was transferred to the medical service he was on room air with oxygen saturations in the low 90's.
Presumed pulmonary source/pneumonia- made more likely with blood cultures growing GPCs, presumably peptostreptococcus.
Tablet PO once a day for 13 days: 40mg daily on Weds [**5-4**].
You were intubated, in the ICU, required antibiotics, steroids, and blood pressure support.
Continue to take your regular home medications except change the following: - START a new steroid (prednisone) taper over the 2 weeks - START vancomycin (an antibiotic), given IV once a day, for another 4 days by the visiting nurse team - STOP naproxen (you were taking this for pain, but it can injure your kidneys, so don't take it until you follow-up with your primary care physician) - STOP levofloxacin/levaquin and azithromycin (antibiotics you had been taking before, and now have completed the courses) - STOP atenolol, because your blood pressure has been on the lower side; if you blood pressure is elevated, then you will restart this medicaiton at half dose and then up to full dose as needed - START colace, a stool softener, as needed for constipation - START advair inhalations to treat COPD - START spiriva inhalations to treat COPD  Followup Instructions: Please attend the following appointment with a pulmonologist (lung doctor): .
