She initially presented to [**Hospital1 **], where vitals on admission were bp 126/77, HR 60, RR 20, temp 98.9, SaO2 95% on RA.
Her exam was "speaking in full sentences, contusion in left occipital region, tenderness to palpation of left posterior chest wall, no vertebral point tenderness or step-offs, cranial II-XII wnl, motor, sensory and cerebellar functions normal."
Labs showed Hct 35.2, WBC 6.6, plt 198, Na 135, Cr 0.92, INR 2.6.
Per report, head CT showed an 8 mm bleed in the left medulla.
CT abdomen/pelvis was ordered to rule out retroperitoneal bleed which was preliminarily negative.
At [**Hospital1 18**], Head CT wet read showed similar appearing hemmorhagic posterior medulla focus, possible slightly increased anterior medulla hemmorhagic focus.
She received Zofran 4 mg IV x1, and since her repeat INR was 2.2 she was scheduled to receive another 2 U FFP.
Past Medical History: s/p mechanical MVR in [**2101**] for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2177**], on Coumadin since the surgery Atrial fibrillation s/p PPM and defibrillator Diabetes mellitus since [**2098**], on insulin pump Hypertension Hyperlipidemia CHF COPD, not on home O2 Hypothyroidism Ulcers Anemia and "chronic bleeding", 2 months ago Hct dropped from 34 to 18, s/p endoscopy, colonoscopy, and capsule endoscopy wihtout source of bleed, Hct been back up to 35 over past 5-6 weeks Osteoporosis  Social History: She moved in with her daughter in [**Name (NI) 205**].

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 66 year old right handed woman with a history of mechanical MVR on Coumadin, atrial fibrillation s/p PPM, DM on insulin pump, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CHF, and COPD who presents with left upper and middle back pain and SOB s/p fall Saturday morning with head CT showing hemorrhage in the left medulla and possible small focus of SAH.
Head CT there showed an 6 mm medullary hemorrhage, and she received 2 U FFP for INR 2.6.
Her INR on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] was 2.2 hence received 2 more units of FFP and repeat head CT showed no change.
She was initially admitted to ICU where she remained stable with no further deterioration and CTA (MRI unable to be obtained due to pacemaker) showed no obivous vascular malformation.
Since she does have significant risk factor for stroke without anticoagulation with her mechanical valve, she had repeat head CT on HD#2 ([**2-21**]) as well as on [**2-23**], both of which showed stability of her bleed.
She had been off of her coumadin and her INR drifted down to 1.6.
Given risk factor for possible hematoma since she had a fall and was anticoagulated, CT torso was obtained which showed no evidence of hematoma.
Her Hct subsequently stabilized around 30.
There was no other identifiable source of infection, though some atelectasis was noted on her CXR which may have also been contributing to her fever.
You will need a CAT scan of your head in one week to ensure stability of the bleed.
