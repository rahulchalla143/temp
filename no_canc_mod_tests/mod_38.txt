EKG showed coarse afib vs atach with 2:1 block without no acute ischemic changes.
Head CT was negative for intracranial hemorrhage and no new c-spine fracture on C-spine.
Right arm x-ray negative for fracture.

C-SPINE NON-TRAUMA W/FLEX & EXT 4 VIEWS  [**2134-3-8**] 3:46 PM IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the c-spine, with limited range of motion.
MR L SPINE SCAN  [**2134-2-27**] 10:09 PM IMPRESSION: Spinal stenosis noted at the level of L3-4 and L4-5 as discussed above.
The appearance of the nerves as they course by the proximal humeral shaft fracture is not well evaluated on this study as it is too peripheral.
CTA: Impression: 1. no PE 2. enlarged pulmonary arteries 3. lymphadenopathy in mediastinum some of which are calcified 4. calcified hilar lymph nodes 5. pulm lymph nodes along major and minor fissures bilaterally 6. fat density structures in liver and stomach .
TTE [**2134-2-17**] Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated.

WOUND CULTURE (Pending):   Brief Hospital Course: Summary: Briefly, this is a 81 year old Russian speaking woman who presented status post fall.
CT of c-spine showed severe stenosis.
She was initially admitted to the medicine service for workup of syncope; neurology was consulted for a weak right arm following R humeral fracture and she was found to have a mixed central cord and Brown-Sequard syndrome and transferred to the neurology service for closer exam monitoring.
She was gently diuresed, and had serial ABG's which showed persistent hypercarbia.
On exam she initially was found to have evidence of a central cord syndrome with weakness affecting arms more so than legs.
MRI of the C-spine was performed for the likelihood of acute spinal cord injury with above findings.
Read of MRI was: "Bulky ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at C2/3, C3/4, and C4/5 levels, more than the right, causing severe spinal canal stenosis.The cervical cord at those levels is deformed and compressed, demonstrating intrinsic T2 hyperintense signal.
Orthopedics also followed her for the broken right humerus, and neurosurgery had initially been consulted in the ED when a head ct showed the question of a subdural hematoma (later proven to be artifactual).
She remained in a hard collar during this time and her exam improved over the next week; the pinprick sensory level retracted to the T12 region for days, then finally seemed to vanish altogether; the proprioceptive changes on the right also resolved.
Although the right arm remained weak and flaccid with just [**2-28**] finger flexors and trapezius/shoulder shrug [**2-28**] (initially thought just limited by pain versus multiple nerve injury), the left arm strength improved to deltoid [**3-31**], [**Hospital1 **]/tri both 4+ to 5-/5, and wrist and finger extensors 4+/5; finger flexors were also 4+/5.
For neuropathic pain, neurontin had been initiated (patient later requested d/c to simplify med regimen).
ABG showed mild CO2 retention, ?
CTA on admission was negative for PE, and the suspicion for PE was fairly low post-op given that the pt was not tachycardic and her oxygen requirement improved.
Therefore, repeat CTA was not done.
The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes, echo showed no obvious severe valvular disease to explain ?syncopal event, though telemetry showed periodic tachyarrhythmia ?sinus tach vs afib.
Urine cxlood cx, and cath tip cx were sent prior to d/c to workup somnolence, however pt's somnolence cleared and cx's were pending on d/c.
Musculoskeletal: initially, radiographic imaging was negative for fracture or bleed including right UE, hips bilaterally, c-spine and head.
Her electrolytes were followed and repleted as needed, MVI and continued niferex.
She should have her potassium and BUN/creatinine followed at regular intervals starting 2-3 days post discharge, as she was discharged on her home dose of [**Last Name (un) **] and new dose of lasix.
She complained of RLE pain one day, and u/s was ordered to r/o dvt - this study was negative.
[**MD Number(1) 1964**]  PROCEDURE:  IM nail right humerus.
Next a 230 by 10 mm [**Doctor Last Name 1968**] and Nephew nail was placed and interlocked with 2 screws proximally.
Wounds were irrigated and closed with 0 Vicryl, 2-0 and a subcuticular 3-0.
[**MD Number(2) 1969**]   Medications on Admission: 1. aspirin 81mg QD 2. glyburide 5mg QD 3. lasix 40mg QD 4. lipitor 20mg QD 5. niferex 150mg [**Hospital1 **] 6. paroxetine 20mg QD 7. losartan potassium 100mg QD (?)
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-28**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Insulin Regular Human 300 unit/3 mL Insulin Pen Sig: One (1) unit Subcutaneous four times a day: Regular insulin sliding scale to keep blood sugar 80-140.
You will need to have your electrolytes checked in the next [**12-28**] days, and your lasix and losartan could be adjusted based on those results.
