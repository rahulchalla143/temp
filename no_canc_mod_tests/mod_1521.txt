Her husband called EMS and she complained of having chest pain for the prior four days, described as substernal chest pressure, rated [**9-8**].
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%.
Spinal stenosis status post lumbar laminectomy L4-L5 in [**2168**].
Neck: Supple with JVP of 6 cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.

ECG Study Date of [**2180-4-20**]  11:24:08 PM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-1-21**] there is new T wave inversion in leads V4-V6 and associated ST segment depression which may represent an active lateral ischemic process.
Cardiac catheterization report: 1.
Central aortic pressure was normal at 116/51 (systolic/diastolic in mmHg).
The final angiogram demonstrated no residual stenosis with no angiographic evidence of dissection, embolization or perforation with TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.
CXR [**2180-4-21**] Moderate cardiomegaly more pronounced, particularly due to left atrial enlargement.
ECHO [**2180-4-21**] Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior free wall, lateral wall, and posterior wall, with extensive apical akinesis; the basal and midventricular segments of the inferior free wall contract best.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Pump: Echocardiogram on this admission revealed depressed EF 20-30%.
The patient's cardiologist could consider repeat echocardiogram in two months for ICD evaluation, although the patient has a history of dementia.
The patient's potassium was maintained greater than 4 and magnesium greater than 2. .
Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine on admission was 1.1 for GFR 48.
The patient's creatinine bumped to 1.4 during admission which was likely pre-renal versus contrast-induced.
Creatinine remained stable and slowly trended downward at time of discharge to 1.3.
Her ACE-I was initially stopped in setting of very mild renal insufficiency and was restarted prior to discharge.
Hematocrit remained stable at this time.
The patient should have an outpatient work-up by gastroenterology.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
