Chlamydia, HIV and GC cultures negative.
Fetal assessment revealed fetal tachycardia and hydrops and the mother was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further care.
A fetal echo done after admission to [**Hospital1 69**] revealed intermittent fetal tachycardia sometimes with rates into the 270 range.
Apgar scores were 7 at one minute and 8 at 5 minutes of age.
EXAM:  Initial exam notable for an LGA infant with moderate edema and significant ascites.
Wt was 2765 gm, length was 41.5 cm, and HC was 33.5 cm, all greater than the 90th%ile.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Upon admission to the NICU, the baby was noted to have a heart rate in the 230s.
An EKG at that time revealed a diagnosis of atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.
The infant once again returned to atrial flutter this morning with EKG revealing aberrant conduction.
Attempts were made to convert back to sinus rhythm with adenosine boluses which were unsuccessful but with subsequent successful conversion to normal sinus rhythm this morning with esophageal pacing.
The infant remained in normal sinus rhythm for the majority of the day of [**5-1**] from about 8 a.m. in the morning until 5 p.m. at night but with physical stimulation during chest x-ray, the infant was noted to convert back into atrial flutter.
Sinus rhythm was eventually obtained with direct cardioversion.
Procainamide level this morning was 9.1 with a NAPA level of 2.3.
Blood pressures have remained borderline, with MAPs 25-30 by A-line and 30-35 by cuff.
The infant has received 1 normal saline bolus for low blood pressures this morning, has not received any further boluses today.
An echocardiogram was performed earlier in the day of [**5-1**].
The results of that echocardiogram are pending.
Blood gases have been stable.
The last blood gas showed a pH of 7.36 with a PCO2 of 43.
She is currently on settings of 24/6 with a rate of 26 and an FIO2 of 31-50%.
Chest x-ray was notable for mild RDS.
Initial D stick was 22 for which she received a 2 per kilo D10W bolus.
She received another 2 per kilo D10W bolus with subsequent blood sugars in the 70 to 90 range.
Electrolytes at 2 p.m. this afternoon showed a sodium of 134, potassium 5.2, chloride 105, bicarb 22, BUN 14, creatinine 1.
Albumin level 1.9.
Bilirubin 4.5 with a direct bilirubin of 0.3.
Urine output has been minimal throughout the day.
ID: Upon admission to the NICU, a CBC and blood culture were drawn.
White blood cell count was 5500, hematocrit 46.1, platelet count 230 with 40% polys and 1% bands.
A blood culture that was drawn at that time has no growth so far.
Moderate ascites is notable on exam, and an abominal ultrasound can be considered in the future.
LFTs this afternoon revealed AST 4, ALT 32, Bili 4.5/0.3, and albumin 1.9.
A head ultrasound has not been performed, but likely should be considered within first week of life.
State newborn screen was sent just prior to discharge.
Prematurity at 31-4/7 weeks.
