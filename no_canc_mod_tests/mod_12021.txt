ECHO: GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal  image quality - poor parasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
Suboptimal image quality -  ventilator.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low  normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior  walls.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
RENAL Ultrasound: PORTABLE RENAL ULTRASOUND  INDICATION: 83-year-old woman with acute renal failure.
A right kidney measures 8.7 cm, left kidney was not measured.
MICROBIOLOGY: [**2138-8-25**] 11:30 pm BLOOD CULTURE     Site: ARM      #1.
Pneumonia: No increased ventilator requirements, but did have questionable infiltrate on CXR and secretions concerning for infection.
Sputum cultures showed MSSA and Acinetobacter that were resistent to cipro.
Cardiac: - Pump: Echocardiogram showed low normal EF with regional wall motion abnormalities likely consistent with known CAD and MI.
No echo was available - CAD: has history of CAD by report and an MI at another hosptital.
- Rhythm: from ECG and cxr it appears that the patien thas a single lead in the ventricle.
Acute renal failure: has elevation of creatinine up from baseline.
Initial labs showed a picture more consistent with pre-renal etiology (FeNA 0.5%) but now showed intrarenal causes (FeNA 1.2%).
Urinalysis did not show signs of overwhelming ATN, though the patient may have had some mild hypoperfusion/hypoxia surronding the unresponsive episode.
Regardless the renal function is stable now and electrolytes were normal.
However, a repeat hct was stable and the patient did not have signs of ongoing bleeding.
However BP improved and outpatient meds were started.
Iron studies show replete iron stores.
