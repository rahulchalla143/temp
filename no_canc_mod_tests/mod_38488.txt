Earlier today, he presented to [**Hospital6 204**] seemingly septic with fevers, tachycardia with HR in the 140s-150s and leukocytosis of 20.
CTA performed at LGH showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates that appeared continuous with a >10cm x 9cm multiloculated fluid collection that seems to extend in the RP space posterior to the R hepatic lobe and upper pole of the R kidney.
He was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

[**2163-8-14**] CT Torso : 1.
Large, 26 x 14 x 10 cm multiloculated, partially liquefied, partially solid fluid collection involving the right paravertebral soft tissues of the mid and lower thoracic spine, the posterobasal segment and pleural space of  the lower lobe of the right lung, the right posterior pararenal space and the  right iliopsoas muscle.
A total of 620 cc of bloody and purulent aspirate was removed, and specimen sent for analysis  [**2163-8-18**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1.
He was transfused with 2 units of packed red cells for a hematocrit of 26 and his blood pressure remained stable.
His tachycardia soon resolved and he then underwent another  CT scan to further delineate the fluid collection and eventually the retroperitoneal collection was drained.
About 600cc of bloody, purulent fluid was drained and the initial gram stain was polymicrobial.
He remained afebrile and his WBC decreased from 25K on admission to 12K 3 days post drainage.
A repeat CT scan was obtained on [**2163-8-18**] to assure the collection was fully drained and he had marked improvement although there was a hypodense area in the posterior post ion of the right lower lobe that potentially could be drained.
As you will need to have a CT to re-image your abdomen to check the status of your abscess, we recommend not beginning therapy with metformin for your blood sugars until after the CT is completed.
