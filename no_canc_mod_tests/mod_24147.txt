IMAGING [**8-13**] CXR SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Evaluation is limited by exclusion of the lateral portion of the right hemithorax.
Lung volumes are low, due in large part to upper lobe atelectasis which improves on subsequent CXR available at the time of approval of this report; subsegmental left lobe atelectasis persists.
Head CT [**8-13**] Head CT: No acute intracranial abnl.
[**8-14**] CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
Correlation with thyroid function tests as well as thyroid ultrasound are recommended.
A head CT scan at the OSH was concerning for a lesion around the vertebral artery and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of this.
A repeat head CT did not show any abnormalities, including any acute processes or bleeding.
Urine was + for cocaine and benzos and blood EtOH level was >200.
CXR was not convincing for consolidation.
Coagulation profile, fibringoen, and platelets are normal range.
Repeat CXR showed some tracheal narrowing.
# Possible thyroid dysfunction - per radiology read on repeat CXR there was an opacity in right upper lobe which may be suggestive of thyroid mass.
TFTs were sent in house and pt should follow up with his PCP about the results as well as to get a thyroid ultrasound.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because a CT of your head at the other hospital showed a possible abnormality of an artery.
Another CT scan was done which did not show any abnormalities in your arteries.
Your blood alcohol levels were found to be very high and there was evidence of cocaine in your urine and this is the most likely cause of you becoming unresponsive.
On your chest x-ray, the radiologist noted an area of haziness in the right upper section which may be due to a thyroid problem.
This is not an acute issue, but we ordered some blood tests in the hospital to test your thyroid and you should follow-up with your PCP about the results, as well as obtain an ultrasound of your thyroid when you leave the hospital.
