GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
Conclusions Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
His bypass time was 60 minutes with a crossclamp of 52 minutes.
It should be noted that after transfer from the ICU Mr [**Known lastname **] did experience a transient elevation of his serum creatinine which has begun to trend back toward normal ranges before discharge.
Outpatient Lab Work VNA to draw hematocrit and creatinine on [**2173-10-4**], fax results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5793**] 8.
