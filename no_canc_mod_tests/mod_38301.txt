IMPRESSION: NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITIES ON MRA OF THE HEAD   Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old male with a hx of hyperlipidemia presents to OSH with acute right frontal embolic CVA, work-up remarkable for ?papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve on TEE, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
Given that this patient has become symptomatic and is at further increased risk of complications including MI and additional embolic strokes, evaluation for excision of this tumor was warranted.
Blood cx's were drawn and have been negative to date.
To note -  Embolic CVA [**1-27**] aortic valve growth (as above): MRI read as embolic strokes, not hemorrhagic, and patient anticoagulated to prevent further propagation.
