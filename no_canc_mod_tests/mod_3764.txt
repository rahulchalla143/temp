At PCPs office, BP was 90s/60s, so his nadolol was D/Cd.
In the ER, labs showed Cr 1.3.
BP 82/68, HR 125, T 94.6, 96% RA, BP increased to 100s/60s with 500ml NS.
RUQ U/S showed no pocket to perform paracentesis so empiric CTX was given for presumed SBP.
Anemia status post EGD in [**4-16**] showing ulcers (H pylori +) and varices and colonoscopy showing internal hemorrhoids and diverticula 5.
Pancytopenia, status post bone marrow biopsy showing MDS versus sideroblastic anemia 8.
Cataracts 9.
Family History: Italian descent - mom died of appendicitis when he was young - father had atherosclerosis, but the patient does not know if he had an MI (myocardial infarction) or stroke - brother did die of an MI (myocardial infarction) at age sixty  - denies any colon cancer or liver disease in his family.

RUQ US ([**7-7**]): LIMITED ULTRASOUND OF THE ABDOMEN: Comparison is made to the prior ultrasound dated [**2109-2-7**].
CXR ([**7-7**]): FINDINGS: There is a new left IJ central catheter with tip in the left brachiocephalic vein.
RUQ US w/ Doppler ([**7-8**]): LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is diffusely hyperechoic and has a nodular contour, compatible with cirrhosis.
Diminished flow in the posterior right portal vein since the prior study of [**Month (only) 1096**].
Echo ([**7-9**]): Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-2-7**], there has been a decline in left and right ventricular systolic function.
An atrial septal defect is not seen on the current study (may be related to technical differences).
CXR ([**7-10**]): There is stable cardiomegaly.
CXR ([**7-12**]): The cardiomegaly is moderate and stable.
While the etiology of the tenuous blood pressure was felt to be from 3rd spacing while being intravascularly depleted it was also thought that the patient might be becoming symptomatic in his continued atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
The patient's blood pressure remained low, but stable for the remainder of his hospitalization.
# Heart Failure: Patient's echo on [**7-9**] showed biventricular heart failure, changed from prior imaging, with no evidence of infarct on EKG.
This was initiated reaching a maximum of Aldactone 50 mg and Lasix 40 mg IV BID, before the patient's blood pressure proved to be problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
# Decompensated cirrhosis: RUQ U/S revealed diminished flow in the posterior right portal vein since the prior study of [**Month (only) 1096**].
The patient's encephalopathy resolved with Lactulose, which was continued PRN for a goal of [**4-14**] BMs/day.
While this was thought to be most likely from his liver disease, his prophylactic, subcutaneous Heparin was discontinued and HIT antibodies were sent off.
Medications on Admission: Neurontin 300 daily Omeprazole 20 daily Aldactone 50mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix 60 AM, 40 PM Humalog sliding scale   Discharge Medications: 1.
