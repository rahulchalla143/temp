On follow-up 2 days later, she noted symptomatic improvement but no increase in UOP, and lasix was increased to 60 mg. Home nurse noted O2 sat of 87% today at rest and 79% with exertion, with O2 sats settling persistently in the 70's at rest, which prompted the pt to come into the ED.
In the ED her vitals were 97.8 111 155/67 24, o2 sat 97% on Non-rebreather.

The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
[**2120-7-15**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - Since [**2120-7-12**] and yesterday, lung volumes remain low.
Bilateral subpleural interstitial markings are still very prominent suggesting severe interstitial lung disease.

The hypoxia was multifactorial, due in large part to diastolic CHF exacerbation (BNP [**2111**] on admission); with contributions from underlying severe interstitial lung disease and possible CAP given leukocytosis and infiltrate seen on admission CXR.
She ruled out for MI with Cardiac enzymes negative x 3.
An echo showed diminished systolic function EF 40% and inferior hypokinesis.
A chest CT revealed extensive fibrotic lung disease consistent with either UIP or NSIP, and PFTs revealed a severe restrictive defect consistent with an interstitial lung disease.
Pulmonary was consulted and recommended to start a [**2-25**] week course of prednisone 0.5mg/kg on [**2120-7-18**], to follow up with Pulmonary in [**11-22**] months and follow up CT chest without contrast and PFTs.
This will need to be adjusted, and likely uptitrated with ambulation to maintain oxygen saturations >90%.
She should have her weight taken daily and receive lasix prn.
However CT scan negative for infiltrate, and leukocytosis increased prior to initiation of steroids.
Heaptic Lesions: Two hypodense liver lesions concerning for malignancy were documented incidentally on CT [**2120-7-18**], and the patient expressed no desire to have follow up.
She had a bedside swallow eval on [**2120-7-15**], that concluded she had funcional oral and pharyngeal swallow but is at increased risk for aspiration due to impulsivity.
