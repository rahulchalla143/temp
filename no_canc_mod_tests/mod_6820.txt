She was sent from nursing home for evaluation as today at 10am developed SOB and desats to the 70s.
ABG 7.3/86/199.
Labs notable for WBC 73 (no bands), K 2.8, lactate 2.4, CK 81, TnT 0.03.
Blood cultures sent.
BiPAP, lasix 40mg, and nitro gtt with good urine output response but decrease in SBP to 50s that improved to 90s after nitro discontinued.
Review of CXR then did not appear to be CHF but rather possible infiltrate consistent with pneumonia so gave ceftriaxone 1g, vancomycin 1g, and levofloxacin 750mg.
Finally, they did not believe that the pneumonia on CXR could explain her hypoxia, thus a CTA chest was performed to r/o PE which showed no PE but multifocal PNA.

Recommend repeating the study with PA, lateral and decubitus views, if patient can tolerate.
Aortic valvular calcifications, of unknown hemodynamic significance.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
# Respiratory failure:  Initially thought to be secondary to bilateral LL PNA seen on CT scan, and given Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Levofloxacin in the ED, however the patient did not have clinical evidence of pneumonia.
The ICU team decided to hold antibiotics on [**12-2**] given negative sputum and blood cx.
Aldolase level was checked which was normal.
Urine culture pending at time of discharge.
UA also notable for large blood with no RBCs - this was attributed to underlying dermatomyositis.
However, once it was clear that BP was stable metoprolol, amlodipine and lisinopril were continued at home regimen.
# Aortic stenosis: Echo done here showed mild aortic stenosis, valve area 1.2-1.9cm2.
