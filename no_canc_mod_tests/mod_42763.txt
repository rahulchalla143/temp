Repeat radiograph after appropriate diuresis to further evaluate the retrocardiac region is recommended.
CT findings suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
This contrast is likely related to the prior mesenteric angiogram performed on [**2117-4-2**] (over 24 hours ago).
Likely etiology determined to be diverticulosis given similar presentation in [**2111**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis.
A colonoscopy was done which showed old blood, multiple diverticuli but no clear source of bleed.
Patient remained with stable HCT x24hrs post-bleed and serial HCT values were stable.
Echo done on [**4-5**] with markedly dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation that is directed towards the inter-atrial septum.
Echo determined to be related to overall fluid positive status for LOS due to pressors/fluid recuscitation/blood products given for GI bleed.
CXR done on HD 1 AM with left-sided chest white-out, possibly collapse.
A CT chest was done for futher evaluation which was without e/o esophageal perforation, LLL atelectasis/collapse but with L lung expanded, a small plueral.
Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.
Cardiac enzymes trended down during hospital course and there was no further conern for cardiac ischemia.
Echo performed on HD4 as discussed above.
# Chronic dHF- Last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%.
Echo done on [**4-5**] with markedly dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation that is directed towards the inter-atrial septum.
Her blood glucose was well controlled on sliding scale insulin.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed.
