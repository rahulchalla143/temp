On repeat examination at the time the patient arrived at the floor, through an interpreter, the patient was awake and alert and not sure why he was at the [**Hospital1 188**] or really the name of the facility.
The patient is reported to have had an episode of decrease in blood pressure on [**2157-5-2**], at the [**Hospital3 **] Center.
Additionally, please note that the patient had a recent admission to the [**Hospital1 69**] between [**2157-4-13**], and [**2157-4-16**], for atrial fibrillation with hospital course complicated by an exaggerated response to Lopressor producing unresponsiveness and hypotension, noting that the patient's vital signs in the Emergency Department at this admission were stable at a heart rate of 75, blood pressure 122/90, respiratory rate 20, and pulse oximetry 97% on four liters.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, afebrile at 98.4, pulse 74, blood pressure 144/63, respiratory rate 12, 97% in room air and 100% on four liters.
Rectal examination was negative for occult blood.
The examination when the patient arrived on the floor the night of [**2157-5-6**], the patient was afebrile, blood pressure 148/100, pulse 53, respiratory rate 18, pulse oximetry 93% in room air.
The strength was full and symmetrical to limited examination in the upper and lower extremity flexors and extensors.
Cardiac examination was unremarkable with regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs were noted.
There were dry crackles at the bases, right greater than the left, and otherwise the patient was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count at the time of admission was 5.3, hematocrit 28.8, with normal differential.
Platelet count was 317,000.
Coagulation studies were essentially unremarkable.
Urine was negative for urinary tract infection.
Chem7 sent at the time of admission on [**2157-5-6**], at 1:30 p.m. was sodium 139, potassium 3.8, chloride 98, bicarbonate 28, blood urea nitrogen 20, creatinine 1.5**a significant value.
Glucose 111.
Calcium 8.8, magnesium 1.6, phosphate 2.9.
Arterial blood gases in the Emergency Department on [**2157-5-6**], at 3:40 p.m. had a pH 7.47, pCO2 46, pO2 77.
Urine culture is pending at the time of this dictation.
Head CT was performed on [**2157-5-6**], with the following impression:  "No acute intracranial pathology, brain atrophy".
Chest x-ray was performed on [**2157-5-6**], with the following impression:  "Persistent pericardial and pleural effusions".
Although the toxicology screen was negative for narcotics, the patient's mental status improved markedly although there was no clear cause and effect relationship for this change.
His creatinine was noted to be elevated to 1.5 and the patient was gently hydrated with 750 ccs of normal saline overnight with a resultant decrease in the patient's creatinine to 0.9 the day following admission, noting that the patient's mouth had been quite dry at the time of admission and it was moist on the morning following admission.
Head CT was performed as noted above to rule out acute intracranial pathology including bleeding.
The possibility of occult seizure is still open to question and the patient will be observed for approximately 24 additional hours to insure that such an episode does not recur.
The patient should not have increased beta blocker without close supervision including frequent blood pressure monitoring and neurologic checks as he has a history of unresponsiveness and hypotension because of sensitivity to beta blockade although he is stable on his current dosing.
The patient should be closely monitored for signs of dehydration and creatinine should be checked q.d.
for one week versus signs for volume overload including pulse oxygenation measured b.i.d.
and on examination as the patient may either need additional hydration or diuretic to insure that he does not begin to become dehydrated, nor does he have worsening of his pulmonary status.
