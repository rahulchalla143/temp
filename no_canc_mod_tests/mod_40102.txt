The patient's chest x-ray on admission was negative, and a magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography done showed no acute infarction and no flow changes in the arteries.
Approximately one to two hours later, the patient had respiratory failure with an arterial blood gas of 7.04/112/84, with a blood pressure of 220/100, and a pulse of 110.
Then, secondary to hypotension (with a systolic blood pressure drop to 70) was transiently placed on dopamine and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of 98.3, his pulse was 110, his blood pressure was 150/70, and he was saturating 100 percent on assist control 750 X 12, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, and an FiO2 of 50 percent.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination showed anicteric sclerae.
The patient's cardiac examination showed that he was tachycardic.
Pulmonary examination showed diffuse wheezes with some rhonchi.
The patient's neurologic examination showed that he was sedated; although, even with decreased sedation he did respond.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count was 17.7 (which was an increase from his baseline of 7.8 on admission), his hematocrit was 34.8, and his platelets were 230.
The patient's sodium was 142, potassium was 5.1, chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 29, blood urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 1.4 (with a baseline of 1.1), and blood glucose was 126.
His calcium was 8.7, his magnesium was 1.8, and his phosphorous was 4.9.
The patient's echocardiogram done on [**1-31**] showed an ejection fraction of 40 percent with severe pulmonary hypertension and severe mitral regurgitation.
After further discussions with the patient's daughters - including the healthcare proxy - the patient was made comfort measures only and extubated.
