In the ED, tamponade was considered given low voltage on ECG although bedside echo demonstrated no pericardial effusion or RV collapse.
The patient had blood cultures drawn on admission that demonstrated no growth.
As above, nasal aspirates were positive for Influenza.
Although radiographically the patient had evidence for a consolidative pneumonia, respiratory cultures revealed oropharyngeal flora only.
Both resting and ambulatory sats were greater than 90% on room air.
# Leukopenia - On admission the patient was noted to have a white count of 6.2 with 11% bands as above.
Anemia: The patient was admitted to Hct of 35.1 with drop to 27.0 after aggressive volume resuscitation.
The patient's Hct stabilized with termination of volume resuscitation and auto-diuresis with Hct on discharge 32.6. .
Patient is afebrile, hemodynamically stable with O2 sats > 90% on room air   Discharge Instructions: 1.
