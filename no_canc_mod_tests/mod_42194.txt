Of note, her INR was 3.9 and she received 5mg of vitamin K and and 2U FFP.
She was then med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Of note, the patient reportedly had been noted to have lung mass on CXR for which her PCP was in the process of setting up bronchoscopy.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she received another 5mg Vitamin K and CXR was repeated which showed bilateral patchy opacities.
labs were significant for an INR of 2.2, Hct 36.8, WBC 12.0.

ECG [**2178-6-6**]  6:02:50 AM Sinus rhythm.
CXR [**2178-6-6**]: There are no previous studies available for a direct comparison.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST [**2178-6-6**] 2:54 PM 1.
Pneumatized soft tissue density in the right mainstem bronchus with imaging characteristics suggestive of secretions.
CXR [**2178-6-14**] NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach.
RIGID BRONCHOSCOPY [**2178-6-8**] 79 yo f with massive hemoptysis.
Rigid bronchoscopy with flexible bronchoscopy with removal of endobronchial thrombus and blood but with no active bleeding seen on the right sided airways.
She presented with hemoptysis in the setting of INR 2.9; she was transfused 1u pRBC and 4u FFP (both on day of admission).
Became hypoxic and was intubated; in the MICU she underwent flexible bronchoscopy on [**2178-6-6**] which showed no endobronchial tumors, but fresh blood and thrombus in the left lung which was suctioned.
Two days later on [**2178-6-8**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy with removal of the thrombus and blood; no active bleeding was seen in right side of the right lower lobe with purulent secretions removed.
She completed a course of Vancomycin/Cefepime ([**Date range (1) 112256**]) and Azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 112257**]), with WBC decreasing to 9.1.
After diuresis to optimize her oxygenation status, on [**6-11**] she was able to be extubated without issues and she was weaned to room air on the medical floor.
She should have chest PT for 15-30 minutes, 3-5 times a day, in addition to having the Acapella flutter valve at the bedside.
She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (who saw her as Pulmonary consult) in a few weeks, with repeat CT scan to evaluate interval change including the nodular infiltrates on her CT here.
No evidence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, particularly since she has not had a history of asthma, and her eosinophil count was quite low.
Aspergillus galactomannan test was negative, so less likely to have invasive Aspergillosis and there is no need for Voriconazole treatment per discussion with Pulmonology.
Atrial fibrillation: s/p [**Last Name (STitle) 5509**], on Warfarin with NEW INR GOAL OF 2.0-2.5.
Besides one self-limited episode of hemodynamically [**Hospital1 5509**] to HR 140's while on the floor, she had no more problems with [**Name (NI) 5509**] and HR is 70-90 at the time of discharge.
(b) Anticoagulation Warfarin was initially held and INR reversed with FFP as above, and after discussion with Pulmonology it was restarted on [**2178-6-15**].
INR is 1.4 at the time of discharge.
***Note: She requires daily INR checks, and new goal INR is 2.0-2.5 to prevent risk of re-bleed.
Passing gas and abdominal exam benign.
Her Aspirin 81 mg was restarted once her Hct remained stable.

INR GOAL CHANGE: She requires DAILY checks of her INR with new goal 2.0-2.5 because of bleeding risk.
Physical Therapy: Should include chest PT for 15-30 minutes, 3-5 times a day, in addition to having the Acapella flutter valve at the bedside.
Follow-up: [**2178-7-9**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Hospital1 18**] Pulmonology).

We treated you by decreasing your dose of Warfarin: YOUR NEW INR GOAL IS 2.0-2.5 GIVEN YOUR RISK OF BLEEDING, AND YOU SHOULD HAVE DAILY INR CHECKS.
Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (Pulmonology appointment listed below, including repeat CT scan prior to the appointment).
Also note that while you were admitted you had an episode of atrial fibrillation with a fast heart rate; for this, you have been started on a new medication (Diltiazem) and your heart rate is controlled.
Change Warfarin dose to 4mg (rather than 5mg) with new INR goal of 2.0-2.5 2.
