An XB LAD 3.0 guide engaged the LCA providing adequate support.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to extensive apical hypokinesis.
She also had a diffusely-diseased small LAD with 90% mid-stenosis which was treated with balloon angioplasty that was complicated by a small dissection (this was further treated with balloon inflation x 3 minutes with good result).
--pump- Ms. [**Known lastname 97029**] ecchocardiogram showed an EF of 30-40% with moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
