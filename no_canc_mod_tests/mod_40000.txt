The patient was febrile with temperature of 104 in the Emergency Room at an outside hospital and tachycardiac and decreased blood pressure with systolic in the 60's.
There on open laparotomy the patient was found to have "pus in her abdomen and pelvis, rapid strep test was performed and was positive for Group B strep.
On [**2157-8-7**] the patient was changed to Vancomycin and Flagyl to also cover a [**12-31**] blood culture positive for coagulase negative staph infection.
The patient had a colonoscopy on [**2157-8-9**], evaluated for C. diff colitis which was negative.

However, the patient had persistently high pulmonary pressures in the 50's, a transesophageal balloon was placed which confirmed the patient's pressures.
The patient was subsequently left on pressure control ventilation for prolonged period of time with permissive hypercapnia, pH allowed to fall to 7.2.
Ventilation was adequate ventilation, oxygenation and sedation was subsequently weaned.
The patient had several episodes of hypotension requiring intravenous fluid boluses and transient chemical pressors which the patient subsequently was able to wean off.
Recorded Stem Test which was performed upon admission for her hypertension and subsequently was normal.
Electrocardiogram reveals sinus tachycardia.
The patient had normal BUN and creatinine throughout hospital course and has good urine output.
Outside blood cultures grew out Group A strep.
Vaginal cultures were negative.
Vaginal ultrasound was performed upon presentation which originally was questionable hydropyelosalpinx however, CT scan of her abdomen did not confirm this.
A CT scan of abdomen did reveal large amounts of pelvic fluid of which Intervention Radiology was consulted for sampling of the fluid.
Ultrasound guided sampling of the fluid did not reveal any organisms and cultures have thus been negative thus far.
The patient persistently spiked temperatures during hospital course and blood cultures have not grown any organism to date.
The patient was started on Acyclovir intravenously for cutaneous HSV which was positive on TSA staining.
Vaginal cultures were negative and as mentioned Infectious Disease the patient's transvaginal ultrasound revealed hydropyelosalpinx however, on CT scan was not confirmed.
The patient was treated for a course of Group A strep, bacteremia and subsequently antibiotics were peeled back.
