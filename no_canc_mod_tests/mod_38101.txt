On the morning of admission, he became lightheaded, called EMT and was found to be bradycardic with a heart rate in the 20s.
EMTs suspected beta blocker overdose, gave glucagon which resulted in stabilization of heart rate to the 60s.
Blood cultures were negative but erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein were high.
The patient was presumptively treated with antibiotics after being ruled out for endocarditis by blood cultures and echocardiography, the patient underwent aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2104-10-17**] showed normal coronary arteries.
Echocardiogram Obtained [**2104-9-16**] in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] showed left ventricular function of 40-45% with diminished aortic and mitral valve areas.
Temperature of 96.5.
Pulse 57-60.
Blood pressure 105/66.
Respiratory rate 16, breathing 97% on two liters.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
TMI was diffuse laterally displaced and his chest wound was clean, dry and intact.
Radial pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Remarkable for potassium 4.5, creatinine 1.0, hematocrit of 28.3 with 6.4% eosinophils.
His INR was 4.3.
Albumin was 3.2.
His electrocardiogram on admission was sinus rate at 63, PR interval was prolonged, 280-312 ms, QRS 176 ms.  [**Name14 (STitle) **] 500 ms.  Axis was slightly left deviated at -33 with a left bundle branch block and marked left atrial enlargement.
Echocardiography from [**2104-10-9**] showed left atrium 5.4 x 8 cm.
Left ventricular ejection fraction of 50-55%, a dilated left ventricle, 2+ aortic regurgitation, 3+ mitral regurgitation, mild to moderate aortic stenosis, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Note that this echocardiogram was obtained prior to his mitral valve replacement and aortic valve replacement.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for observation of his heart block and evaluation by the Electrophysiology Service.
Patient was deemed to need to continue treatment with amiodarone and beta blocker and thus it was decided that he would need a DDD pacer since he was exhibiting sensitivity to amiodarone and Lopressor in terms of his AV node function.
Once the patient's INR was less than 1.5, the patient underwent pacemaker implantation on [**2104-11-7**].
The patient tolerated the procedure without event and his heart rate remained AV paced in the 70s with blood pressures 100-110 systolic/50s-60s diastolic throughout his admission.
His other issue on admission was complaint of subjective fevers with a history of rheumatic heart disease and previously being ruled out for endocarditis, so, it was decided to obtain three sets of blood cultures 12 hours apart to again check for endocarditis which were negative throughout his stay.
He also received a transesophageal echocardiogram which was negative for valvular vegetations and negative for a valve leak.
Hematology:  During the hospitalization, the patient exhibited a hemolytic anemia with low haptoglobin, high LDH and a reticulocyte index that suggested an inadequate marrow response.
There was no perivalvular leak which could explain the hemolytic anemia and it is recommended that the patient's hematocrit be followed and his anemia worked up as an outpatient.
The patient received two units of packed red blood cells to keep his hematocrit above 25% during this admission.
The patient was briefly treated with Motrin 800 mg times two doses which caused an elevation in his creatinine from 0.9 to 1.7.
Urinalysis was consistent with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs toxicity, positive for eosinophils.
The hematoma was observed, immobilized with a pressure dressing and stabilized on [**11-11**] with an INR of 2.3.
The INR remained therapeutic through the day of discharge [**11-13**] with an INR of 3.0.
Goal INR because of this patient's mechanical valves is 2.5 to 3.5.
Coumadin 3 mg po per day with target INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
