Contrast-enhanced imaging displays matched abnormalities, in blood volume, blood flow and mean transit time in a left middle cerebral artery distribution.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK FINDINGS: There are severe stenoses noted at the origins of the vertebral arteries bilaterally.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 88 134 92 390/435.57 56 56 8   PA/LAT: No active disease  Repeat NCHCT [**5-28**]: Evolving large left MCA stroke.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers (cannot definitively exclude).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Onset of current symptoms was 11:45 PM last night, but wife notes that early yesterday morning(0200 on [**4-24**]) patient had 20 minutes of slurred speech which completely resolved.
CT perfusion and CTA head and neck vessels were performed with the hope that the patient might be a candidate for the Merci device.
The concordance of images on CT perfusion, mean transit time and mean volume suggest that any intervention would both be dangerous and unlikely to yield any recovery in this patient.
Neuro:  A repeat CT head at 24 hours from TPA showed evolving MCA infarct but otherwise unchanged, no new infarct or bleed.
Tox screens were negative.
HgbA1c 5.4% and fasting lipids with total 187, trig 80s, HDL 39, LCL 128.
Echo with bubble study showed normal EF without atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale or interatrial aneurysm.
Patient was started in Aspirin ~24 hours out from IV TPA after repeat head CT was performed.
Cards:  Allowed BP to autoregulate and monitored on cardiac tele for associated arrhythmias without events.
Ruled out myocardial infarct by cardiac enzyme x 3.
ECHO was unrevealing as mentioned above.
CXR negative.
You have had a speech and swallow evaluation and should take pureed solids and nectar thickened liquids with 1:1 assist only.
