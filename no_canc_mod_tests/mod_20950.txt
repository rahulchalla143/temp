This 59 year old gentleman had no symptoms at rest but had a known history of coronary artery disease since a prior catheterization in [**2152**].
A stress echocardiogram showed anterior wall hypokinesis.
This led to cardiac catheterization on [**2171-10-18**], which revealed a right dominant system and 80 percent left anterior descending coronary artery lesion and 50 percent circumflex lesion and a 95 percent obtuse marginal one lesion and 95 percent obtuse marginal two lesion, 50 percent lesion of the right coronary artery and a 70 percent lesion of the posterior descending coronary artery.
The patient had no mitral regurgitation, had an ejection fraction of 71 percent.
Prior echocardiogram [**2171-10-8**], showed ejection fraction of 60 percent, no mitral regurgitation, no aortic insufficiency, but anterior hypokinesis and multiple hypokinetic areas.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, his heart rate was 76 and regular, blood pressure 140/88 right and 150/84 on the left, height six feet four inches with a weight of 220 pounds.
Lower extremity varicosities were most severe below his left knee.
Pulse oximetry was performed with oximetry placed on his right thumb.
LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative laboratories included a white blood cell count 9.8, hematocrit 39.9, platelet count 210,000.
Prothrombin time 12.1, partial thromboplastin time 30.7 with an INR 0.9.
Sodium 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate 27, blood urea nitrogen 23, creatinine 1.0, blood sugar 75.
Urinalysis was negative.
Additional laboratories included ALT 36, AST 27, alkaline phosphatase 69, total bilirubin 0.3, total protein 6.7, albumin 4.5, globulin 2.2.
Preoperative chest x-ray showed no active lung disease and no evidence of congestive heart failure.
Preoperative electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 63 beats per minute and normal electrocardiogram.
Postoperative laboratories were as follows:  White blood cell count 10.6, hematocrit 30.1, platelet count 160,000.
Potassium 4.4, blood urea nitrogen 17, creatinine 0.8, with a blood sugar of 104.
His chest tubes remained in place.
He had a better blood pressure in the morning of 102/60.
His Lopressor was on hold for his blood pressure as was his Lasix.
On postoperative day number three, he continued to have air leak from his left pleural chest tube, but he had no further orthostasis.
His beta blockade was restarted on a blood pressure of 106/66 and heart rate of 85.
His hematocrit remained stable at 27.3 with a creatinine of 0.8.
Chest x-ray was repeated on water seal and Lasix was restarted as the patient had no further orthostasis.
Chest x-ray showed partial collapse of his left lung.
On postoperative day number four, his blood pressure dropped slightly to 90/60.
His chest tube had no air leak on the morning of postoperative day number four.
A repeat chest x-ray was done later that day.
Repeat chest x-ray showed pneumothorax with the plan to try and switch the patient back to water seal and then repeat chest x-ray again.
The patient's discharge was held up based on the results of his repeat chest x-ray.
He was saturating 95 percent in room air with a heart rate of 79 and sinus rhythm and blood pressure of 126/66.
His chest tube was removed after the air leak disappeared with plans to discharge him if his chest x-ray was OK.
