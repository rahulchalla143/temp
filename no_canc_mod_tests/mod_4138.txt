He had an echocardiogram performed the day prior to presentation which was normal.
When the code team arrived on the scene, the patient was complaining of crushing chest pain, was pale and diaphoretic, and no blood pressure or pulse could be measured.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure immeasurable, pulseless.
An initial electrocardiogram showed what appeared to be a sinus tachycardia with a somewhat widened QRS and ST elevations diffusely in the precordial leads and inferior leads.
The pulse was later lost and CPR was recommenced.
Initial blood gases revealed severe metabolic acidosis.
Preliminary results from a post mortem revealed inferior myocardial infarction with papillary infarction.
