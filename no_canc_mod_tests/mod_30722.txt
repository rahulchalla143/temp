Patient ruled out with 3 sets cardiac enzymes, no EKG changes, and stress test revealed cardiomyopathy with EF 30%, no reversible defects.
2 nights prior to transfer, patient felt unwell and experienced a low-grade fever, chills with T 99.5.
Patient had an emergent CT scan which did not reveal bleed, but showed evidence of prior infarctions.
She received an LP which showed 1 WBC, 0 RBC, Glu 75, TP 32.
She received a neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT which were reportedly unremarkable.
Given persistence of fever this morning (101), patient is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation and management; specifically, team at OSH felt that patient may benefit from MRI, which they are unable to do with intubated patients.

MRI BRAIn: 1.
The M2, M3, and M4 segments are not definitely visualized.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 1258**] [**Known lastname **] is an 82-year-old woman with CAD s/p 4V CABG, CHF (EF 25%), PVD, who was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress, transferred here for further work-up and management of persistent mental status changes and fever.
Head CT negative for acute changes at OSH.
Given concern for central process, emergent head MRI was obtained which showed large MCA stroke with several small bilateral acute CVAs, likely embolic.
SBP was maintained > 120 with intermittent use of pressors to maintain cerebral perfusion.
TTE was done which showed no vegetations or abscess.
Given depressed LOC, EEG was done to rule out non-convulsive status, which showed widespread encephalopathy.
CXR unremarkable for infiltrate or effusion on admission.
2/2 Blood cultures at OSH returned positive for Staph aurues, and Vancomycin was continued.
Surveillance cultures were obtained.
TTE was obtained to assess for endocarditis, and no vegetations were seen.
# CARDIAC/NSTEMI Patient with significant cardiac history, CAD and ischemic cardiomyopathy, reduced EF 25%.
Patient began to rule in for MI at OSH, enzymes and EKG revealed NSTEMI here.
