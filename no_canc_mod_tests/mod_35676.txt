ECHO [**12-24**]    1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess but is probably low normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function (EF) cannot be reliably assessed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Hip xray ([**12-20**])- Comminuted fracture, left proximal femur with intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric components.
Head CT ([**12-20**])- no acute intracranial findings -prelim.
C-spine CT ([**12-20**])- no fractures or prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
DJD of spine, but relatively normal vertebral body alignment.
CTA [**12-24**] MPRESSION: 1.
CXR for NG placement [**12-26**] (wet read).
CXR [**12-26**]  There is a nasogastric tube whose distal tip and side port are not included on the study and are below the inferior margin of the film.
There is again seen an opacity at the left base most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis as seen on the recent chest CT.
Dedicated films with a true lateral radiograph would be helpful to exclude occult fracture.
[**12-31**] CXR, official read pending but no gross evidence of opacity (wet read)  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 86 yo male with AF on Coumadin, CAD s/p CABG, s/p ORIF for left hip fracture [**2127-12-24**] after a fall on [**2127-12-21**].
Also on arrival to the MICU gross blood was seen from NGT but this quickly changed to billious output over the day.
He will need ongoing PT and rehabilitation of his recently fractured hip.
Elbow films were negative for fracture and ortho considered this a frozen elbow.
Surveillance cardiac enzymes from [**12-24**] were negative.
Work-up revealed negative urinalysis, although CXR showed RLL opacity read as likely atelectasis.
On the day of discharge, WBC count was elevated at 14.
CXR was done and negative for PNA.
U/A was sent and negative.
Urine cultures are pending at time of discharge.
This was communicated to his PCP and he can have an outpatient colonoscopy at a later date.
Otherwise, his HCT was stable throughout admission.
