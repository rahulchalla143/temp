The patient had an O2 saturation in the 80s when they arrived, with a heart rate in the 130s, atrial fibrillation at that time and blood pressure with a systolic of 200.
Once he arrived in the Emergency Room he had a neurological workup with a CT scan that was negative for an acute bleed, and an event that was felt to be not likely neurological in nature.
The patient had no MI at that time, his enzymes were negative, and he was being worked up for an electrophysiology study with a probable ablation plus or minus a pacemaker, however, it was felt that prior to that procedure he should have a cardiac catheterization.
He underwent cardiac catheterization on the [**12-22**].
Catheterization showed 70 percent left main, 30 percent proximal LAD with 70 percent diagonal, 80 percent ostial circumflex, and 40 percent RCA with 100 percent PDA and an EF of 50 percent.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for CAD, congestive heart failure, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine 1.5 to 1.7, and left lower extremity cellulitis.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  At the time of consult height was 5 feet 8 inches, weight 180, heart rate 65 atrial fibrillation, blood pressure 141/73, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 99 percent on two liters.
Pulses showed radial 2 plus on the right, 1 plus on the left, dorsalis pedis 2 plus bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.1, hematocrit 30.7, platelets 337,000.
PT 14.3, PTT 35.1, INR 1.3.
Sodium 137, potassium 3.6, chloride 101, CO2 30, BUN 31, creatinine 1.4, glucose 195, ALT 12, AST 12, alkaline phosphatase 54, amylase 34, total bilirubin 0.6, albumin 3.4.
Stress test done on [**11-24**] showed moderate reversible inferior lateral defect and an echo done on [**12-28**] showed an EF of 50 percent with 3 plus MR and 2 plus TR.
Chest x-ray at the time of admission showed mild pulmonary edema.
Carotid ultrasound showed no significant stenosis on either side.
At the time of transfer the patient was AV paced with a mean arterial pressure of 68 and a CVP of 90.
His insulin drip was weaned off and he was started back on a sliding scale insulin as well as his oral hyperglycemics, however, he was kept in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for close pulmonary as well as hemodynamic monitoring.
His antihypertensives were adjusted and on postoperative day 10 it was decided that he was stable and ready to be discharged to home.
At the time of this dictation the patient's physical exam is as follows:  Temperature 97, heart rate 75 AV paced, blood pressure 139/74, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 96 percent on room air.
Weight is 82 kg, on admission was 250 pounds.
Laboratory data shows PT is 19.5, INR is 2.4.
On physical exam neuro is alert and oriented, moves all extremities, follows commands, nonfocal exam.
Pulmonary shows clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Additionally the patient is to have an INR checked by the visiting nurse on [**2118-1-5**] with results called to Dr.[**Name (NI) 104690**] office.
