At the OSH, he had a chest x-ray that demonstrated blunting of the costophrneic angle, a normal Hct and a normal EKG.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his initial VSs were HR 82, BP 110/70, RR 22, 97% 2LNC.
His blood pressure remained stable (>115 systolic throughout), and he was never tachycardic.
CTA of the chest demonstrated bilateral pulmonary embolism.
CT scan showed extravasation of contrast at colon anastomosis.

Massive bilateral acute pulmonary embolism with no CT evidence of right heart strain.
bilateral LE ultrasound: Left popliteal varix, likely related to underlying Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, containing non-occlusive thrombus, with no more central thrombus seen.
There was no evidence of right heart strain on CT scan; troponin of <0.1 and BNP of 79 placed him at low risk stratification.
He was continued on heparin gtt with goal PTT of 50-70.
Hct was stable during stay, and all stools were guiac negative.
The patient will call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3060**] for an outpatient hematology appointment during the next 1-2 months to discuss whether he will need further work-up for etiology or prolonged anticoagulation.
