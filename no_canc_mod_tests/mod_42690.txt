On the day of admission, he underwent PVI and developed a large pericardial effusion and hypotension with SBP 80 he was transiently on phenylepherine.
His blood pressure stabilized, pressors were weaned, and drainage from pericardial drain decreased.
On arrival to the CCU, his VS were T:96.8 BP 127/62 P: 89 SaO2 99% RA, Pulsus 6mmHg.
EKG showed NSR at 90, with no STE or STD.

- MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 17367**]/FX P/P CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-12-17**] 1.
ECHO [**2126-1-1**] Digital study was continued in same Echo Pacs folder as the initial EP lab study from 1 hr earlier..
ECHO [**2126-1-2**] The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Echo revealed pericardial effusion.
On arrival, a pulsus paradoxus was checked which was 6mmHg and patient was normotensive.
On HD2, the pericardial drain was discontinued and repeat ECHO showed no pericardial effusion.
