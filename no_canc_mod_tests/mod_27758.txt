MRI of the lumbar spine revealed a cystic mass at the T12-L2, which was found to be a hematoma upon surgical exploration on [**2133-6-12**] and was subsequently evacuated.
Pt has been on Coumadin and digoxin due to her cardiac hx and initially her INR was 3.5.
Physical Exam: VS:  HR - 103  RR - 20  T - 98.8  BP - 124/78   O2 sat - 95% on RA  Pain - [**4-21**]  Gen: WN, WD thin woman who appears her age.
Resp: CTA b/l A/P, no W/R/R Abd: +BSx4, soft, NT/ND, no HSM Ext: PP present and symmetric, except dorsalis pedis R>L.
Pertinent Results: [**2133-6-12**] 12:20AM   DIGOXIN-1.1 [**2133-6-12**] 12:20AM   PT-23.0* PTT-31.6 INR(PT)-3.5 [**2133-6-12**] 12:20AM   WBC-8.8 RBC-4.13* HGB-13.6 HCT-39.2 MCV-95 MCH-33.0* MCHC-34.8 RDW-13.4 [**2133-6-12**] 12:20AM   GLUCOSE-137* UREA N-18 CREAT-0.6 SODIUM-135 POTASSIUM-3.8 CHLORIDE-96 TOTAL CO2-28 ANION GAP-15  MRI L-Spine [**2133-6-12**]: IMPRESSION: Extramedullary hematoma, which may be intradural or epidural, compressing the conus and cauda equina from T11/12 through L1/2.
A conventional angiogram is recommended for assessment of vascular malformation.
Follow-up lumbar spine MRI is also recommended to evaluate the surgical decompression.
MRI L-Spine [**2133-6-13**]: IMPRESSION: Status post decompression of a large dorsal epidural hematoma, there is soft tissue swelling which continues to impress the distal cord and proximal cauda equina.
CXR [**2133-6-15**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Massive enlargement of the left atrium  Echo [**2133-6-16**]: IMPRESSION: Normal functioning mitral valve prosthesis.
Following diagnositic evaluation, the patient was taken to surgery for a T12-L2 laminectomy and subsequent evacuation of the hematoma.
Her coumadin was held and her INR monitored following surgery.
She was placed on coumadin 3.0mg Qhs once her INR dropped below 2.0 and she was bridged with a heparin drip.
Coumadin was increased to 4.0mg on [**2133-6-17**] and as her INR rose to 2.8 on [**6-22**], decreased to 3.0mg.
Subsequent to her INR dropping from 2.5 to 2.1 on [**6-25**] and then to 1.9 on [**6-26**] the coumadin dose was increased to 4.0mg and 5.0mg repectively.
Coumadin continued to be titrated to a dose of 3.5mg (her dose PTA) giving an INR of 2.4 at discharge.
In order to maintain K levels above 4.0 to avoid potential dysrhytmias from hypokalemia, spironolactone 25mg PO daily was started.
On this regimen the patient required 40mEq of KCl PO daily to maintain her K levels and this was reduced to 20mEq daily as the K level on the day prior to discharge was 4.5.
For heartrate control metoprolol was increased over time to an eventual dose of 75mg PO BID the day prior to discharge, during which time the patient's BP was stable at SBP=110s to 130s.
In addition she spiked a temperature to 100.3, for which an infection work-up was began.
Urine Cx showed Proteus Mirabilis, Bld Cx negative.
She was treated impirically on Vacnomycin, which was d/c after the Bld Cx came back negative, and Ciprofloxacin.
