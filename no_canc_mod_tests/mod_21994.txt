Per [**Hospital3 **] records during [**Month (only) 547**] admission, the patient was admitted for jaundice with a bilirubin peak of 38.8, which was down to 21.9 when he signed himself out against medical advice.
During his admission at the VA, he developed a non-oliguric acute renal failure with a discharge creatinine of 1.8.
The patient initially admitted to an outside hospital where he was found to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 143/70 with a respiratory rate of 36, sating a 100 percent on 10 liters nonrebreather.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.4 degrees, blood pressure 119/47, and heart rate of 67.
The patient is on AC 500/16 with an FiO2 of 50 percent, PEEP of 5 with peak pressure of 30 and plateau of 19.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA:  On admission, white count 20.3, hematocrit 35.7 down from a prior 38, platelets of 127, INR 1.6 with a PTT of 35.1.
UA:  Negative nitrite and leukocyte esterase, 0-2 white blood cells, no bacteria.
Chemistry is notable for potassium of 5.6, creatinine of 2.1, ALT of 58, AST of 117, total bilirubin of 17.4 down from 21.9 when he signed himself out AMA from the VA.  Liver and gallbladder ultrasound: Coarse and nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
CT of the head without contrast:  No shift or intracranial bleed.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 66-year-old male with history of COPD and alcoholic hepatitis, who recently signed himself out against medical advice from the [**Hospital **] Hospital following an admission for acute alcoholic hepatitis with a peak bilirubin of 38.8, re-presented to an outside hospital with complaints of shortness of breath and Delta MS, transferred here for continued care.
His Lasix, spironolactone and propranolol were held due to hypotension and hyperkalemia.
The patient's liver function worsened over the course of this admission and likely was the underlying cause of his demise.
Initial ABG consistent with a persistent respiratory acidosis, thus his ventilator settings were manipulated overnight to improve ventilation and his pH subsequently responded.
Acute renal failure:  The patient presented with a creatinine of 2.1 up from his discharge creatinine from the [**Hospital **] Hospital of 1.8.
Initial concern for prerenal failure due to hypovolemia in the setting of hypotension, however, as his urine output improved with fluid resuscitation and pressor support; however, his creatinine again later in the course of his hospital stay began to rise.
His bladder pressure at that time was noted to be 23, a large volume paracentesis failed to result in a improvement in his creatinine and thus he was started on midodrine and octreotide for likely hepatorenal syndrome.
His urine output subsequently improved with hope for renal recovery.
As volume became an issue, Lasix diuresis was attempted; however, his creatinine bumped in response to this and no further Lasix was attempted.
His initial paracentesis was not consistent with SBP and his chest x-ray remained negative for infiltrate.
Blood cultures remained negative until later in his hospital admission following successful wean off of his initial pressors including dopamine and vasopressin, at which time, his blood cultures became positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
Blood, urine and sputum cultures were sent.
CT of the abdomen was negative for perforation and ERCP was negative for cholangitis.
Paracentesis was done to rule out SBP and remained negative.
Elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase:  During the course of the patient's admission, his bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase increased concerning for obstructive-like picture.
Ultrasound negative for portal vein thrombosis or common bile duct dilation.
As stated above, the patient's blood pressure dropped into the 40s despite pressor support.
