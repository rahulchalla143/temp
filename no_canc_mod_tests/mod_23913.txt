TTE [**10-28**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Cardiac Cath [**10-28**]: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
CT Head [**11-3**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Technically limited study secondary to motion artifact without evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**11-3**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Fatty liver  Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo man with presumed CAD, DM who presents w/ resp distress found to be profoundly hypertensive, evidence of aspiration on CT chest and rising CEs.
Troponins were cycled X 3 with elevation in CK-MB and troponins.
ECHO showed akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and mild global hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 40 %).
Cardiology was consulted, and cath patient underwent cardiac cath, which showed in-stent restenosis of patient's prior LCx stent, and underwent thrombectomy and re-stenting.
2) Aspiration PNA - Febrile with WBC count elevated at 27 on initial labs, now trending down likely after fluid resuscitation.
Aspiration PNA vs pneumonitis read based on appearance on CT Chest.
Sputum and blood cultures were obtained, but were negative.
3) Persistent Fevers - Patient continued to be febrile despite broad antibiotic coverage, and was believed to be febrile [**2-24**] DTs vs. drug fever, as all cultures and infectious w/u was negative following the initial imaging of aspiration PNA vs. pneumonitis.
Likely [**2-24**] poor perfusion in the setting of NSTEMI.
