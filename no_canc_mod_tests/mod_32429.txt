He was given lovenox and sent for CT chest.
ECG at that time showed new right bundle branch block compared to prior.
CT showed massive bilateral pulmonary embolism involving both arteries.
At that time patient was noted to have HR 11, but stable BP and O2 sat 93-96% 2LNC.
He has a 16 month daughter for whom he is a caretaker along with his wife.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-12-31**], a patent foramen ovale is identified on the current study and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
Right ventricular cavity size/systolic function and the pericardial effusion are similar.
LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND [**12-31**]: 1.
He was not treated with thrombolytic therapy as his blood pressure remained stable.
His condition continued to improve with no worsening of symptoms and improving oxygen saturations at rest and with exertion.
His EKG showed evidence of right heart strain and a S1Q3T3 pattern on EKG.
Anticoagulation with warfarin was initiated with INR monitoring as described below:  [**1-4**]: 7.5 mg [**1-3**]: 7.5 mg [**1-2**]: 10 mg [**1-1**]: 10 mg  [**2125-1-4**] INR(PT)-2.8* [**2125-1-3**] INR(PT)-2.0* [**2125-1-2**] INR(PT)-1.4* [**2125-1-1**] INR(PT)-1.5* [**2124-12-31**] INR(PT)-1.7* [**2124-12-31**] INR(PT)-1.4*  On the day of discharge he was ambulating without difficulty and maintaing sats of 92-98% on room air while ambulating.
Of note, Factor V Leiden testing was performed at [**Hospital3 10310**] prior to this admission and found to be negative.
His echo findings did reveal a moderately hypokinetic right ventricle.
The office can be found at [**Hospital3 10310**] hospital on the [**Location (un) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 81987**]).
