At [**Hospital1 487**] on initial exam she is described as confused, and slow to respond, with no memory of the fall.
Head CT was performed and showed diffuse SAH, and a small L frontal SDH, as well as subgaleal hematoma.
Head CT repeated here and showed a 1.7 x 0.9 cm frontal contusion in addition to the SAH and SDH seen on the prior study.
Past Medical History: HTN GERD MVP Palpitations (since she was a young woman)   Social History: Lives alone, family in the area (daughter [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77807**])   Family History: NC   Physical Exam: T- 97.8 BP- 129/71 HR- 67 RR- 16 O2Sat- 100% on vent Gen: Lying in bed, intubated HEENT: hematoma R occiput, moist oral mucosa Neck: in C collar CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: intubated and sedated.
Toes upgoing bilaterally  Coordination: not assessed  Gait: not assessed   Pertinent Results: [**2146-2-28**] - CT head w/o contrast  IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2146-2-28**] - CTA head  IMPRESSION: No short interval change in the pattern of subarachnoid hemorrhage, left subdural hematoma, and left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
[**2146-3-1**] - CT head w/o contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2146-3-2**] - CT c-spine  IMPRESSION: No cervical spinal fractures.
[**2146-3-3**] - CT head w/o contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2146-3-6**] - CXR PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained on [**2146-3-6**] and compared with the most recent study performed on [**2146-3-1**].
Cranial nerve exam was intact (though R pupil is surgical).
1) Traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage- On repeat CT at presentation she was found to also have a small L frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage- most likely consistent with traumatic hemorrhage from contrecoup injury.
Although the SAH is also most likely traumatic, given how diffuse the hemorrhage was and aneurysm was ruled out by both CTA head and neck and conventional cerebral angiogram.
Repeat head CT demonstrated significant clearance of the subarachnoid hemorrhage so we felt that it was safe to titrate her off of the nimodipine.
A repeat urine sample should be obtained at the rehab facility in order to make sure that she has cleared the infection.
4) Hypertension: blood pressure running 150s-160s SBP, so metoprolol dose increased to 25mg PO BID.
Discharge Instructions: (1) please monitor mental status and neurologic exam (2) 7day course of amoxicillin started today due to sensitivities of a second bacteria species that were just revealed and likely resistant to cipro (s/p 3 day course) (3) obtain f/u urinalysis in order to make sure that the UTI has cleared.
