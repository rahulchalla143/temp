[**9-14**] CXR SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable, with persistent enlarged cardiac silhouette.
The lateral projection shows some pleural thickening which could be some loculated fluid posteriorly and some discoid atelectasis as well.
[**9-20**] CXR PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained on [**2109-9-20**] and compared with the prior radiograph of [**2109-9-16**].
There is some patchy increase in density in the left lower lung field, probably in the lingula, which is unchanged from prior examination and likely represents subsegmental atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in the appearances since the study of [**2111-9-17**] with atelectasis/airspace disease in the left lower lung zone.

Orthopedics followed her throughout her hospital stay given concern that she might develop compartment syndrome; serial exams were without evidence of this.
2 prior muscle biopsies were not consistent with polymyositis.
Acute renal failure: Creatinine peaked at 2.1 from a baseline Cr 0.5, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis.
Urine electrolytes were consistent with a renal etiology (FENA 11 %) and the renal service followed her throughout her hospital course.
At time of discharge, her creatinine was stable at 1.9.
This will need to continue to be monitored as an outpatient.
She will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] at [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient; next creatinine to be checked [**9-27**] and faxed to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**].
Pneumonia: Given a persistent cough, a chest X-ray was obtained, which showed a left lower lung opacity (atelectasis versus infiltrate).
Her hemoglobin A1C was 6, and her fingersticks remained well-controlled throughout her hospital stay.
TSH 1.4 on admission.
Anemia: Hematocrit trended down from 36 on admission, although at time of discharge it was stable at 28.1.
Her iron studies were consistent with iron-deficiency anemia.
She was started on iron and will need a colonoscopy as an outpatient.
