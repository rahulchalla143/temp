Pt presented to the ED with T 98.0, HR 80, BP 170/103, RR 18, 99%RA.
Bedside TTE obtained showed moderate pericardial effusion without RV collapse.
Echo was repeated and showed a pericardial effusion with worsening pericardial pressures, thought to be consistent with early cardiac tamponade physiology.

[**2146-10-4**] CXR PA/Lateral Cardiac silhouette is moderately-to-severely enlarged, due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.
[**2146-10-10**] Echo The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-10-5**], the pericardial effusion appears smaller.
The etiology was most likely [**12-30**] to ARF on CRI [**12-30**] FSGS.
She had a brief echo in the ED which r/o signs of tamponade.
A repeat echo on [**2146-10-5**] was concerning for early tamponade physiology.
Her pulsus was monitored daily along with her BP and HR.
A repeat echo on [**2146-10-10**] revealed a smaller pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade.
She will most likely need a repeat echo after discharge in [**11-29**] weeks.
ESRD [**12-30**] to FSGS on HD She has a h/o FSGS proven on biopsy in 2/[**2144**].
