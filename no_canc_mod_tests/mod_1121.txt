He was also treated with fluconazole for urine cultures positive for yeast from [**Date range (1) 9846**] and then again from [**10-11**] to present.
He was started on free water flushes 200 cc Q6H with little improvement in his serum sodium.
He also has had an increase in his serum creatinine from a baseline of 0.8 to 3.8.
He had a CT of the abdomen performed as an outpatient on [**2154-10-10**] to reassess for intraabdominal abscess.
Given his significant electrolyte abnormalities he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
His initial laboratories were notable for a serum sodium of 153 and creatinine of 2.6.
His troponin was 0.10.
His EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 98, norml axis, normal intervals, right bundle branch block deep TWI in III, aVF, V3-V4, unchanged from priors.

CT chest/abdomen and pelvis w/o contrast [**2154-10-10**]: 1.
CT [**10-14**] w/o contrast .
EKG: atrial fibrillation at a rate of 98, norml axis, normal intervals, right bundle branch block deep TWI in III, aVF, V3-V4, unchanged from priors  .
CXR [**2154-10-12**]: AP chest radiograph compared to [**2154-8-23**] shows slight increase in bibasilar opacity likely representing atelectasis.
However, Creat continued to rise and since recent CT scan [**10-10**] had shown new b/l hydronephrosis and possible L UVJ stone, urology was consulted.
Alongside this, his urine cx persistantly were positive for klebsiella and thus urology was reccommending PCN for decompression.
Repeat renal US showed worsening hydro and bladder scan had >1L urine, thus urology once again adjusted foley and placed larger catheter with larger baloon to hold in place.
Finally, creat started to improve and repeat US showed that L hydro had greatly improved.
Was tolerating tubefeeds and hydration through PEG (he pulled out R IJ and were having difficulty getting IV access), plan is to continue FWF 200cc q4hours to keep up I/Os.
Afib, rate controlled -cont increased dose metoprolol 100mg TID and dilt 90mg qid .
The right gluteal fluid collection has decreased in size on CT scan since his previous imaging study.
This should be follow up with CT in 3months and further addressed by primary care physician.
