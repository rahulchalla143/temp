Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2178-3-24**], the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new and c/w multivessel CAD or Takotsumo cardiomyopathy.
Infundibulum at the origin of the left posterior cerebral artery P1 segment versus sub-3-mm aneurysm in this area.
A CTA of the head would be valuable in clarifying this issue.
Cardiac catheterization: 1.
Non-obstructive CAD with 40% proximal LAD thrombus likely representing resolved thrombus.
Underwent cardiac catheterization significant for patent stent and 40% proximal LAD thrombus.
No apical ballooning noted on ECHO but patient did have diffuse hypokinesis making stress cardiomyopathy a possible etiology of her ECG changes.
# Pump: Echo with EF of 25%.
Toprol was titrated up as tolerated by her blood pressure.
# HTN:  Titrated her toprol and lisinopril as tolerated by blood pressure.
Creatinine remained stable in setting of diuresis.
# Communication: patient and husband ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 97554**] (home); Office ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 97555**] .
