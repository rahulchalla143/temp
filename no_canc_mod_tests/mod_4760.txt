He had an initial cardiac catheterization, which revealed three vessel heart disease and an ejection fraction of 40%.
The patient also had an aortic valve gradient of 0.7 as well as a 40 mmHg gradient.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  On admission, the patient had a temperature of 97.7?????
?F, a pulse of 75, a blood pressure of 145/83, respirations of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.
The cardiovascular examination was a regular rate and rhythm.
The respiratory examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
On [**2104-9-11**], the patient had a lower extremity Doppler, which showed no upper saphenous vein on the right or left.
The pulmonary consultant recommended that we start the patient on Levaquin empirically, follow arterial blood gases and continue nebulizer treatments every two to four hours.
The renal service was also consulted because of increasing BUN and creatinine and symptoms consistent with acute renal failure.
The renal consultant's assessment and plan included maintaining the systolic blood pressure over 100, continuing diuresis and changing Levaquin to q.o.d.
On [**2104-9-18**], the patient was transfused with another unit of packed red blood cells and platelets were noted to be less than 100.
Due to the platelet counts, which were still at 27,000, the wires were cut instead of being pulled.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  On discharge, the patient had a temperature of 98?????
?F, a pulse of 79, a blood pressure of 120/64, a respiratory rate of 18 and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.
The cardiovascular examination was a regular rate and rhythm.
The respiratory examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The extremities had palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and no peripheral edema.
LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  Laboratory data included a platelet count of 27,000, potassium of 4, BUN of 49 and creatinine of 1.4.
