Angiography on [**8-15**] showed multiple aneurysms and the pt underwent a posterior communicating aneurysm clipping on [**8-15**].
Tmax on [**8-15**] was 101.6.
On [**8-21**] CT showed unchanged diffuse SAH; increased hypodensity L basal ganglia.
Angiography on [**8-24**] demonstrated slightly increased vasospasm and the CSF final culture showed no growth.
[**8-25**] CT was stable, LENIs were neg showing no thrombus in the lower extremities.
Final blood cultured from initial fever work-up showed no growth.
On [**8-26**] severe vasospasm was demonstrated on repeat angiography and verapamil was begun.
On [**8-27**] the pt received 2 units of packed red cells for a Hct drop from 27 to 23.8.
On [**8-29**] the drain was discontinued and CT demonstrated a slight interval increase in size of lateral ventricles and likely the third ventricle as well, following clamping of the ventriculostomy drainage catheter.
Chest x-ray was consistent with fluid overload.
Repeat angiography on [**8-30**] demonstrated vasospasm treated with verapamil; CXR with mild CHF and a new small right pleural effusion, as well as new LLL opacities.
CT from [**8-31**] was unchanged.
A lumbar puncture was performed on [**9-1**] with an opening pressure of 21 cm of H20 and cloudy yellow fluid.
WBC increased from 8.8 to  14.5 on [**9-1**] and ceftriaxone and vancomycin were begun.
Preliminary CSF culture data demostrated 4+ PMNs with no organisms.
On [**9-5**] CSF was noted to be leaking from the scalp which was then closed with staples.
Also on [**9-5**] LENI studies were negative showing no thrombus in the lover extremities, UA was also negative, HHH was discontinued.
CT abd showed Small right pleural effusion and hypodense left renal cystic lesion too small to characterize.
MRSA culture was negative.
Her sutures/staples were all removed and incisions well healed.
