COMPARISONS: CT C-spine from [**2179-7-26**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial and sagittal T1 and T2-weighted cervical spine imaging was performed.
However, these fractures are better visualized on the earlier CT C- spine examination At the C4- C5 level, there is mild protrusion of the intervertebral disc anteriorly.
STUDY: CT of the neck with and without reconstructions.
COMPARISONS: CT C-spine from [**2179-7-26**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired from the posterior fossa to the lung apices.
Coronal, sagittal, volume rendered and MIP reformatted images were then obtained.

Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
There are concerns regarding injury of the cord or ligamentous fractures and MRI is recommended.
Bilateral facet fractures of C4.
Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C4 on C5.
Given the extent of injury, an MRI should be obtained to evaluate for ligamentous and/or spinal cord injury.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
