FINDINGS: There has been dramatic interval change when compared to exam from [**3-8**].
Blood cultures negative from [**9-19**] on.
He was resuscitated with 6 L of IV fluids then levophed was used to keep his MAP above 65.
CXR and Chest CT from [**9-21**] revealed nearly majority of left lung with solid consolidation, no evidence of empyema.
[**9-30**] CXR with small ?cystic lesions in L upper lobe consolidation, CT chest consistent with large confluent lucencies of left lung likely secondary to necrosis and Right lung base patchy infiltrates.
Pt had a tracheostomy on [**9-30**].
His O2 sats are 94 - 98 % on room air.
He recieved periodic transfusions during dialysis to keep his HCT above 30.
q6hour FS since his TF are continuous.
He is not on amlodipine, captopril, lopressor, and hydralizine with blood pressures still in the 150 - 160.
His hydralizine will need to be continually titrated up for a goal of SBP 130 - 140.
