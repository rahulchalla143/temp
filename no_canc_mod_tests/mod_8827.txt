PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission, the patient was afebrile, blood pressure 116/63, pulse 97, respiratory rate 26, O2 sat 99% on room air.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABS ON ADMISSION:  The patient had a white count of 16.9, hematocrit 39, platelets 243.
His ABG on room air was 7.36, 44, 156, 26, sodium 138, potassium 4.7, chloride 102, bicarb 23, BUN 13, creatinine 1.0, glucose 168.
His CKs were 963 with an MB fraction of 44, index of 5, trended down to 709, then 494, to 391, to 193.
EKG on admission - the patient had a normal sinus rhythm at 78 beats per minute.
HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient went for a cardiac catheterization on the day of admission which showed an ejection fraction of 35%, apical and anterolateral hypokinesis.
It showed RA mean pressure of 14, RV pressure 33/13, PA pressure 33/18 with a mean of 26, wedge 18, left ventricular pressure 103/20, cardiac output 3.6, cardiac index 1.8, SVR 1579 and peripheral vascular resistance 178.
His PA sat was 63%.
His catheterization also showed one-vessel disease, left main, no stenosis.
1) CARDIOVASCULAR COURSE - MYOCARDIUM:  The patient is status post an anterior wall MI, now with an ejection fraction of 35% and anterior and apical hypokinesis.
His PT and INR was not therapeutic at time of discharge.
The patient's lipid levels were checked and were found to be total cholesterol 122, triglycerides 112, HDL 27, LDL 73.
However, after much discussion with the team it was decided that his lipid levels may be falsely decreased in a setting of an acute myocardial infarction.
He will check his INR and PT on Monday and fax results to his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Include 1) Mavik 1 mg po qd, 2) atenolol 25 mg po qd, 3) aspirin 325 mg po qd, 4) Plavix 75 mg po qd x 30 days, 5) Lovenox 60 mg subcu q 12 h until therapeutic INR, 6) coumadin 3 mg q hs, 7) Lipitor 10 mg po q hs and the patient has a prescription to check his INR and PT on Monday.
