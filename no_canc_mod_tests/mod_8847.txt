While there, the creatinine was noted to increase to 3.1 and the patient became febrile to 102.5.
Blood cultures were sent which grew gram negative rods in two bottles.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post renal transplant in [**2138-3-5**] and [**2143-12-6**], chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.4 in [**2144-6-5**], coronary artery disease with a moderate anterior reversible defect and an EF of 58%, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post appendectomy, status post TAH BSO.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Room revealed temperature 98.5, pulse 86, blood pressure 156/71, respiratory rate 19 and 98% O2 saturation on two liters of oxygen.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal exam was soft, nontender, non distended with no tenderness at the graft site.
There is a palpable thrill in the right AV fistula and the patient's skin exam revealed multiple bruises.
LABORATORY DATA:  Blood cultures and urine culture were sent.
White blood cell count 5.9, hematocrit 23.7, platelet count 139, sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 102, CO2 15, BUN 55, creatinine 3.4, glucose 204, PT 12.2, PTT 63.8, INR 1.0.
EKG revealed sinus rhythm at a rate of [**Street Address(2) 28717**] depression and ST elevations improving from prior EKGs.
Chest x-ray revealed no lung consolidation, no evidence of CHF.
Her intravascular volume was carefully repleted and creatinine was monitored.
Heme:  The patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 23.7 given her history of recent myocardial infarction.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  Fluid was provided gently as described above.
Repeat blood cultures and urine cultures were sent.
On [**2144-8-25**] the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 25.
Because of the temporal relationship to the blood cell transfusion, it was felt that the patient was likely having an anaphylactic reaction to the transfusion.
During the day of [**8-25**] the patient was noted to have an expanding hematoma and multiple laboratory abnormalities including a low platelet count, acidosis and a hematocrit of 11.8.
Ultrasound of the neck revealed extensive subcutaneous fluid in the neck which was felt to represent either edema or hematoma.
An MRA of the neck was obtained as well which showed the major vessels of the neck to display normal coarse and caliber with the exception of a moderate stenosis in the proximal right ECA.
The patient's CK enzymes were cycled and a downgoing trend was followed.
There was concern that the patient may have suffered myocardial ischemia during the acute drop in hematocrit as the CK enzymes declined, there was no further evidence of ongoing ischemia.
On [**2144-9-4**] in the setting of hypotension and a temperature spike, blood cultures and urine cultures were sent.
Urine culture ultimately revealed enterococcus for which the patient was treated with Vancomycin for three days.
This was ultimately stopped secondary to two negative urine cultures following treatment.
This was sent for culture and the patient also had a CT scan of the sinuses which was negative for sinusitis.
Ultimately, culture data which had been taken on sputum from around the time of the patient's initial temperature spike revealed Enterobacter which was sensitive to Imipenem and indeterminate to Quinolone.
Legionella and cryptococcus were evaluated and these tests were negative.
C. diff studies were sent and these were also negative.
Fungal and mycobacterial isolates in the blood were sent and these were also negative.
After two days of Meropenem treatment, the patient's white blood cell count and temperature stabilized.
White blood cell count returned to within normal limits and did not rise after that.
Temperature remained generally stable with occasional low grade fevers.
The patient developed an increased BUN and creatinine and was noted to have falling urine output.
Initially her urine output responded and increased to normal saline boluses.
However, ultimately the patient's urine output tapered down and was unresponsive to both boluses and Lasix.
Following the aggressive transfusion after the hematocrit of 11.8, the patient's hematocrit ultimately remained stable.
Over the course of the next several weeks the patient's hematocrit did slowly trend downward, occasionally requiring transfusions of one unit at a time in order to keep her hematocrit over 30.
Iron studies and retic count were checked.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition.
Electrolytes were checked and adjusted with hemodialysis.
Her potassium remained generally stable throughout the admission.
Following the development of the large neck hematoma, very low hematocrit and need for aggressive resuscitation for hypotension and low hematocrit, there was concern that the patient suffered anoxic/ischemic brain injury.
Neurologic consultation was obtained which revealed no Doll's eye reflex, a positive corneal reflex on the left, no gag reflex, no withdrawal of the upper extremity to pain but withdrawal of the lower extremities bilaterally to pain.
Reflexes were brisk in the upper extremity and the right lower extremity, however, the right lower extremity reflexes were greater than the left lower extremity reflexes.
The neurology consult service recommended obtaining an MRI and MRA of the neck to evaluate the patient.
MRI of the head performed on [**2144-8-27**] revealed no evidence for a large territorial infarct but two foci of infarctions in the left cerebellar hemisphere which were new compared to a prior CT scan in [**2144-7-5**].
The patient's neurologic exam was closely followed throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.
Some exam findings were fluctuant.
On [**2144-8-30**] EEG revealed an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a slow disorganized background with burst of generalized swelling.
On [**2144-9-3**], EEG revealed slow and disorganized background with occasional bursts of generalized slowing felt to indicate widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures, however, medications, metabolic disturbances and infections were among the most common causes.
The patient's neurologic exam continued to be followed with a goal of assessing this as her renal failure resolved.
A repeat EEG was obtained on [**9-10**] and [**9-11**].
A repeat MRI was obtained.
This exam found that in comparison to the study of [**8-27**] there were no major vascular territorial infarcts that had developed.
