There, a CT showed old right temporal hypodensity suggestive of an old ischemic/hemorrhagic infarct of unknown age.
Instead, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.

Radiology: CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT BRAIN PERFUSION; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS [**2135-6-17**] 5:58 PM  IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT demonstrates encephalomalacia in the right temporal region with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the middle cerebral artery distribution indicative of an evolving infarct.
CT perfusion demonstrates large area of increased transit time and decreased blood volume and decreased blood flow.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates occlusion of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery immediately distal to the supraclinoid internal carotid artery bifurcation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2135-6-17**] 11:18 PM IMPRESSION:  Evolving large right MCA territory infarct.
Recommended followup imaging to exclude hemorrhage.
Probable subarachnoid hemorrhage along the midbrain and right ambient cistern which can be further evaluated with a followup CT as the immediate post contrast CT demonstrated vascular enhancement due to presence of contrast and was limited for evaluation of subarachnoid blood.
Lung volume has been reduced but lungs are clear and there is no large-scale atelectasis.
Limited evaluation of the lower lungs demonstrates no acute abnormality.
Evaluation of the bowel gas pattern is suboptimal on this view, but air and stool are seen in the colon.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2135-6-26**] 12:00 N IMPRESSION:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest compared to [**6-24**] show decrease in the size of the still a large pneumoperitoneum.
Cardiology: Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2135-6-18**] at 12:30:59 PM Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
Initial CT showed loss of grey-white matter differentiation in the right MCA distribution indicative of an evolving infarct and CTA showed occlusion of the M1 segment of the right MCA.
CTP showed a large area of ischemia and infarction in the right MCA territory.
In the ICU, post-procedure CT head scan demonstrated likely extravasation of contrast material into the right temporoparietal cortices, basal ganglia and right frontal subarachnoid spaces.
MRI showed a completed right MCA infarct with minimal edema or midline shift but there was evidence of blood products indicating hemorrhage in the basal ganglia.
She was placed on telemetry which showed persistent AF.
Stroke risk factors were assessed and A1c 5.4% and FLP revealed Chol 159 TGCs 66 HDL	84 LDL 62.
An echo was performed to look for thrombus and this showed no evidence of intra-cardiac clot and revealed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function with EF >60%,  pulmonary HTN and  aortic valve sclerosis.
She had no further issues and she was easily extubated and transferred back to the floor on [**2135-6-24**] where her exam remained stable.
Following her PEG, she was started on warfarin, and aspirin and s/c heparin are to continue until her INR is therapeutic.
She continued to have a considerable pneumoperitoneum on repeat imaging although abdomen was soft and patient was uncomfortable, hence tube feeds were held for bowel rest and were restarted on [**2135-6-27**].
She was initially only started on aspirin and latterly anticoagulated with warfarin and to continue aspirin and s/c heparin  until INR is therapeutic.
Her examination improved and abdomen as latterly soft and she was easily extubated on the morning of [**2135-6-24**] and transferred back to the floor where her exam remained stable.
However, in the next days after her operation, she still had a considerable pneumoperitoneum on repeat imaging and although abdomen was soft, patient was uncomfortable and the decision was to hold tube feeds for bowel rest.
Transitional issues [ ] Patient will require daily INR monitoring and to stop aspirin and s/c heparin when INR therapeutic [ ] Next INR to be drawn on [**2135-6-28**] [ ] Patient had bradycardia to 40s (no HD compromise) and resolved after stopping timolol eye drops.
[ ] Please monitor her serum potassium and restart Klor-Con or potassium supplements if needed.

Stop when INR > or = 2.
Brainstem reflexes intact, (Left eye surgical pupil and fixed at roughly 4mm and irreular right 2mm reactive) neglects left side, withdraws to noxious in all limbs with dorsiflexion in left ankle and extension in left arm.
You had a CT scan which showed a stroke on the right side of your brain and evidence of a blocked artery supplying this area.
YOu were also found to be in an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation which is likely the cause for your stroke as the irregular heartbeat predisposes to blood clots forming within the heart and thence going up to the brain to cause  a stroke.
Medication changes: We STARTED warfarin 5mg daily We STARTED aspirin 325mg daily (stop when INR > or = 2) We STARTED atorvastatin 10mg daily for our cholesterol We DECREASED furosemide to 20mg twice daily We DECREASED timolol to 0.25% drops daily  Please continue your other medications as prescribed.
