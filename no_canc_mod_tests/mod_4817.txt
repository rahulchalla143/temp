IMAGING: [**2127-5-12**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized thorax, there is bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
Abdominal vasculature demonstrates pronounced atherosclerotic calcification.
[**2127-5-12**] CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Pelvic loops of small bowel are normal.
[**2127-5-20**]: CXR - PA AND LAT - Bilateral pleural effusions, more on right than left.
Further followup chest examination is recommended.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2125-11-23**] sinus tachycardia is now present with non-diagnostic ST segment changes.

Please see below for full hospital course details:  # Clostridium difficile colitis: Stool studies tested positive for C.difficile toxin and CT of abdomen reported pronounced pancolonic wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding but no free air, free fluid or pathologic lymphadenopathy.
Initial WBC count of 26 came down to 21, then 13 and is now down to 9 range at time of discharge.
Mr. [**Known lastname 23747**] abdominal cramps continued to be better overall but he had some brief breakthrough pain on [**2127-5-19**] that was noted so an upright abdominal film was done and it showed no evidence of any microperforations or free air.
Repeat CT on [**2127-5-20**] showed interval improvement in pancolitis which was reassuring.
#Sepsis: As above, the patient had leukocytosis to 26 range, temperature to 100sF, lethargy and sinus tachycardia to 130s on admission so sepsis was the major concern.
Blood pressure was largely preserved and was 120s/70s in ED.
Blood cultures returned negative but he had both a proteus UTI and C.difficile colitis on additional studies so his lethargic presentation was first felt to be from urosepsis vs. transient bacteremia from some bowel translocation effects.
However, negative blood cultures ruled out true bacteremia.
He complained of some left sided sternal pain which was reproducible on physical exam and more consistent with musculoskeletal pain but given his risk factors some additional cardiac enzymes were sent and 2 sets were negative.
A follow-up EKG showed no concerns for any ST elevations/depressions or changes from his usual baseline EKG.
CXR was done on [**5-20**] and showed some small bilateral effusions which may have been from some slight fluid overload as his diuretics were held for over a week and a half and he had been given some generous IVFs.
Although normal LVEF of 60% on his last ECHO in [**2124**], he may have some mild diastolic dysfunction which may be underappreciated.
He will need a follow-up CXR in [**3-11**] weeks time to help assess fluid status.
# ARF: The patient's rise in Creatinine was attributed to prerenal dehydration from excessive diarrhea and urinary frequency from his UTI.
His diuretics, both Spirinolactone and Lasix were held, and he was initially given IVFs for resuscitation with concern of looming sepsis picture as above.
Here, he was found to have bacteria on urine study and a follow-up culture showed Proteus so he was treated for a complicated UTI with 7 days of IV Cefepime which he completed on [**5-19**].
He had excellent urine output by time of discharge and no signs of recurrent cystitis.
# Parkinsons Disease:  He was continued on his usual home medication regimen which included benztropine, gabapentin, Carbidopa-Levodopa (25/250) 1 tablet PO QID.

At time of discharge Mr. [**Known lastname 23707**] had stable vital signs and he was tolerating a regular diet well.
Additional lab tests and a CT scan of your abdomen were done and you were found to have an infection in your colon called Clostridium difficile colitis that was respnsible for your diarrhea.
Additional urine studies also showed that you had a bladder infection or urinary tract infection.
Your abdominal pains, rapid heart rate, and lethargy all improved slowly.
