In the Medical Intensive Care Unit she also had one episode where she had an elevated systolic blood pressure in the 190s with a heart rate in the 160s.
She was kept off all anticoagulation until ENT had finally said that it was reasonable to restart her on aspirin and Plavix that she had been on prior to her admission; however, the patient had been n.p.o.
The patient's second pulmonary issue had been some minimal respiratory distress which prompted a chest x-ray.
The chest x-ray showed evidence of a left lung collapse.
Daily x-rays had showed continued lung collapse despite normal respiratory status with oxygen saturations very low amongst oxygen in the high 90s.
The patient had a chest CT scan to further characterize the nature of her lung collapsed.
The chest CT scan showed that there was complete collapse of the left lung, most likely due to central mucus plugging.
On the day that the bronchoscopy was performed, the patient was noted to have improved breath sounds on the left side and the chest x-ray showed improved aeration of the left lung with clearance of the mucus plug, thus, the patient did not undergo bronchoscopy.
At the time of this dictation, the patient's respiratory status was completely stable and the patient was having very good oxygen saturations on room air.
The patient was not started on a beta blocker as her heart rate had been bradycardic when she was monitored on Telemetry.
Of note, the patient has a history of congestive heart failure with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and an ejection fraction of 30 to 40% with combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
The Cardiology Team was consulted and they felt that her delirium episodes were not correlated with her periods of bradycardia which usually occurred at night.
She was monitored on a regular insulin sliding scale here and was covered for fingersticks greater than 200.
Thus, it is the goal with rehabilitation to titrate her total parenteral nutrition with insulin that her fingersticks remain below 200.
