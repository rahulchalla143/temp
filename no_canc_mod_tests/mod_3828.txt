CT head [**2147-2-17**]  FINDINGS: Previously described left cerebellar hemorrhage is unchanged in size measuring 2.3 x 1.8 cm with unchanged mild surrounding edema and mild mass effect on the vermis and inferior fourth ventricle.
Compared to the most recent prior CT from [**2147-2-15**], there is unchanged size and density of the left cerebellar hemorrhage with mild mass effect on the vermis and inferior fourth ventricle.
MRI of the brain might be considered for evaluation of underlying masses, vascular malformation, or amyloid angiopathy.

Neuro: The patient was admitted for q1h neurochecks and her examination remained stable.
A repeat CT head upon arrival was unchanged from prior.
Her blood pressure was maintained below 160 systolic and HOB was greater than 30 degrees.
She had a repeat head CT on [**2-17**] which showed a stable hemorrhage.
An MRI brain was deferred as it was thought it would be unlikely to change management decisions at this time.
Sensitivities showed e coli that was sensitive to nitrofurantoin.
CV: She was noted to hypertensive during her admission, and was started on metoprolol for blood pressure control.
