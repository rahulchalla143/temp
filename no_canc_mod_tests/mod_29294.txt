CXR [**2102-10-11**] Heart failure.
Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
CTA ABD/PELVIS [**2102-10-11**] 1.
Final arteriogram demonstrates no active extravasation.
CXR [**2102-10-12**] As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a clear improvement.
Echo [**2102-10-13**] e left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
CTA Abd [**2102-10-13**] Active extravasation from the right femoral artery with extensive retroperitoneal hematoma.
CTA [**2102-10-14**] 1.
# Acute blood loss anemia [**3-14**] lower GI bleeding: Patient received 2 units PRBC at [**Location (un) 620**], and HCT 41 to 40.
The patient's vitals were stable on presentation to the ED.
He went to IR where they were able to successfully coil a branch of his left colic artery and his repeat HCT was 32.
His [**Location (un) 4532**] and aspirin were held (indication was TIAs).
His hematocrit was rechecked and found to be 23, he was given 2 units of PRBCS and sent for stat CT which showed a bleeding pseudoaneurysm which IR injected with thrombin.
Serial HCTs remained stable, and DP pulses and abdominal exam also remained reassuring.
On transfer to the floor on HD4, repeat HCT demonstrated significant drop to ~22.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1356**] was asymptomatic, vital signes were stable, femoral wound was tender but clean and dry without evidence of evolving hematoma.
Repeat CTA in the morning revealed no active bleeding and interval decrease in the size of the RP hematoma.
Serial hematocrits were stable and Mr. [**Known lastname 1356**] was discharged back to independant living.
His CXR showed ?
volume overload thought [**3-14**] to his blood transfusions.
He was weaned slowly from 02 and had an ECHO which showed EF 60-65%, severe MR (known from history), mild AS and mild/mod AR.
# Elevated Creatinine:  On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 30613**] creatinine was elevated to 1.5.
Elevation may have been in setting of acute volume depletion from blood loss.
His creatinine was 1.0 at dicharge.

Lower GI Bleed 2.
An imaging study of your abdomen was able to localize the bleed in your intestine such that our interventional radiologists could access the bleed via a vessel in your groin area to stop it.
Your blood counts and blood pressures were monitored carefully in the ICU.
One more imaging study was performed several days after the procedure to make completely sure that you were not bleeding.
Your blood counts and blood pressures have remained stable since.
