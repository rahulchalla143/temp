):  This is a 45-year-old gentleman, with past medical history significant for a CVA secondary to [**Hospital1 7344**] abuse, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic severe hypertension, admitted on [**2120-2-21**] with severe GI bleed.
On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be nonresponsive with a systolic blood pressure of 100, and a hematocrit of 11.3.
The patient was also found to have acute renal failure with a creatinine of 4.3.
The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further care.
A neuro consultation was obtained, and the patient was loaded with Dilantin, although a seizure disorder, or seizure activity were felt to be very low on the differential.
On admission, the patient was found to have cardiac enzymes which were positive for myocardial infarction.
A head CT was obtained on [**2-22**] which showed no acute changes from previous studies.
Biopsy obtained during the EGD returned on [**2-26**] positive for H. pylori, and the patient was started on treatment.
His white blood cell began to trend up, and blood cultures were obtained.
Sputum culture from [**2120-3-2**] grew gram-positive cocci in pairs.
A trach was performed on [**2-29**].
EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 135/55, heart rate 66, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 97% on room air, temperature 98.2.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally.
LABS ON ADMISSION (ORIGINAL LABS FROM [**2120-2-21**]):  White blood cells at 8.3, hemoglobin 3.4, hematocrit 11.3, neutrophils 76.1, bands 0, lymphocytes 20.6, monocytes 2.9, eosinophils 0.2, basophils 0.1, platelets 232, PT 14.3, PTT 21.6, INR 1.4, sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 105, bicarb 22, BUN 81, creatinine 4.3, glucose 145, ALT 16, AST 26, CK 194, alkaline phosphatase 45, amylase 99, total bilirubin 0.2, albumin 3.2, calcium 8.1, phosphorus 3.5, magnesium 2.0.
LABS ON [**2120-3-4**] (AT WHICH TIME THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE [**Hospital1 **] SERVICE):  White blood cell count 13.0, hematocrit 37.0, platelets 436.
Differential - 70.3 neutrophils, 23.1 lymphocytes, 5.1 monocytes.
Chemistries - sodium 146, potassium 3.6, chloride 109, bicarb 28, BUN 29, creatinine 2.6, glucose 76, calcium 8.8, phosphorus 3.9, magnesium 2.5.
CHEST X-RAY (AT THAT TIME):  Showed unchanged linear bilateral bibasilar atelectasis without focal consolidation.
On [**2120-3-7**], the vancomycin was discontinued, as the patient's white blood cell count was trending down, and his fever curve was resolving.
Multiple blood cultures were obtained during the fever spikes, and these have all been no growth final read.
On this regimen, the patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled.
His hematocrit has been stable and within range since that time with no active bleeding.
In addition, the patient's biopsy was positive for H. pylori, and he received a 2-week course of treatment, including clarithromycin and a PPI.
5) ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  It was thought that the patient had an anoxic brain injury during his episode of severe anemia and hypertension in the Emergency Department on presentation.
No further imaging or work-up was indicated.
6) RENAL FAILURE:  In treating the patient and following his creatinine, it appears that he has some baseline renal dysfunction secondary to his severe chronic hypertension and diabetes.
His baseline creatinine appears to be between 2.3 and 2.6.
As an ACE inhibitor was added to control his blood pressure, his creatinine was followed closely, but did not have a significant long-term increase.
However, he underwent a speech and swallow study and was cleared to take thickened liquids and purees without risk of aspiration.
On [**2120-3-22**], he underwent another speech and swallow evaluation to see if his diet could be advanced; these results are currently pending.
