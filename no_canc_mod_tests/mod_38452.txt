She had elevated cardiac enzymes and troponins at that,  along with ST elevations by EKG ruled in for non- STEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization.
Catheterization done at [**Hospital1 **] MC showed three-vessel coronary artery disease and cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for possible CABG (coronary artery bypass graft).
As stated, the catheterization showed three-vessel disease, including 95 percent left main, 95 percent RCA (right coronary artery), 80 percent circumflex and 99 percent distal LAD (left anterior descending) with an EF (ejection fraction) of 40 percent.
Her meds at home include nifedipine XL 90 q.day, Lipitor 40 q.day, Paxil 20 q.day, atenolol 25 q.day, Celebrex 200 q.day, meclizine 12.5 q.day, Imdur 120 in the a.m., 60 in the p.m., and Buspirone 10 b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Height 5 feet, weight of 154 pounds.
VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate 57 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 147/100, respiratory rate 22, O2 sat 99 percent on room air.
RESPIRATORY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis 1+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 5.8, hematocrit 31, platelets 317, PT 13.3, PTT 41.9, INR 1.1, sodium 139, potassium 3.5, chloride 105, CO2 27, BUN 13, creatinine 0.4, glucose 161, ALT 18, AST 26, alkaline phosphatase 95, amylase 17, total bilirubin 0.3.
She had a CABG x4 with the LIMA (left internal mammary artery) to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the LAD (left anterior descending), saphenous vein graft to OM (obtuse marginal) and saphenous vein graft to the PDA (posterior descending artery).
Her bypass time was 71 minutes with a crossclamp time of 59 minutes.
At the time of transfer, the patient was A paced at 88 beats per minute with a mean arterial pressure of 71 and a CVP of 11.
The patient continued to do well and it was felt that she was ready to transfer to the floor, but, given her age, it was decided that she would be transferred instead to a medical intensive care unit for close monitoring of her hemodynamic status.
On postoperative day 2, the patient was transferred back to the cardiac surgery recovery unit, due to rapid atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate of 120 to 140.
Blood, as well as urine cultures, were sent and the patient was started on oral levofloxacin.
Chest  x-ray was also done at that time that showed no infiltrates and the patient stayed in the ICU at that point for close pulmonary monitoring.
The following day, all cultures returned negative and patient's antibiotics were discontinued.
By postoperative day 5, the patient's chest x-ray had shown improving lung fields and diaphragmatic excursion, and, at that time, she was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
She had no further of bouts of atrial fibrillation and, on postoperative day 9, it was decided that the following day the patient would be stable and ready to be discharged to rehabilitation.
At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical exam is as follows.
Temperature 97.9, heart rate 59 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 139/64, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 96 percent on 3 liters.
Weight preoperatively 69 kg, at discharge 66.6 kg.
LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 144, potassium 3.9, chloride 105, CO2 31, BUN 32, creatinine 0.9, glucose 109, PT 14, PTT 31, INR 1.3, white count 10, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 366.
