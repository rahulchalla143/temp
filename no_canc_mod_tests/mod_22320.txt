CT head: IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2193-2-14**] significant tachycardia is new.
CXR [**5-4**] Left subclavian vascular catheter terminates within the proximal to mid superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.
Findings are consistent with a diffuse right lung pneumonia as demonstrated on recent CT of [**2194-5-3**]; however, given worsening volume loss, there is likely coexisting atelectasis involving portions of the right middle and right lower lobes.
CT head [**5-4**] Hyperdensities noted within the sulci and along the tentorium appear consistent with previous contrast bolus given on [**2194-5-3**].
Although subarachnoid hemorrhage cannot be definitively ruled out the normal size of the ventricles and normal appearance of cisterns suggest the etiology of hyperdensities as being due to sluggish circulation and stasis of contrast within vasculature, possibly in the setting of renal insufficiency.
MR head [**5-4**] 1.
MRA/MRV and nuclear medicine perfusion imaging are suggested for further characterization.
Abnormal signal within the subarachnoid space bilaterally may represent residual contrast from prior CAT scan in the setting of renal insufficiency.
He was admitted to MICU having been intubated for airway protection and necessary medical studies given he was extremely agitated in the ED.
Pneumonia was discovered on CXR and CT scan to involve all 3 right lobes and BC grew strep pneumoniae.
EKG showed no ischemic changes and trop negative.
CT head and C-spine in ED were negative for acute injury.
Patient was intubated and sedated in the ED for airway protection and necessary imaging studies mentioned above and transferred to the MICU.
On his first night in the hospital patient developed an episode of hypotension to SBP 48.
He was started on pressors with recovery of blood pressure within 10 minutes.
EEG showed near-isoelectric tracing and MRI revealed diffuse brain swelling consistent with anoxic brain injury.
CXR and CT torso showed multifocal PNA in right lobe.
CXR was not consistent with PCP so steroids and bactrim were stopped.
Acute Renal Failure Creatinine was elevated to 3.4 from previous baseline of 0.8-1.0 after CT torso with contrast today.
Patient was found down and BUN/CR ratio was approximately 20:1 suggesting pre-renal azotemia.
Could also be rhabdomyolysis in setting of unknown time down, though only small blood on UA and CK 139.
