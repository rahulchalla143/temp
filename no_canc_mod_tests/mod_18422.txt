LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions PRE-CPB:1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
