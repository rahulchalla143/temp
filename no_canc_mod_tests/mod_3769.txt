Overdialysis was a possibility, since it was reported that the patient was dialyzed down 4 kg.
Her hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachycardia could be attributed to hypoperfusion.
Her CXR was without infiltrate.
On the floor her blood cultures came back with 1/2 bottles of coag neg staph, likely a skin contaminant.
Vancomycin levels were checked and she received vancomycin at hemodialysis.
CSF cultures remained negative.
The patient is being discharged on a 10 day course of vancomycin, to be dosed at hemodialysis for vanco levels less than 15. .
Prior work-up has been unrevealing (EEG: normal, CT: old infacts).
Head CT showed no acute changes.
Her hypercalcemia may be contributing to her mental status.
PTH, TSH, and Vit D studies were sent as well.
She was given a dose of vancomycin at HD and cultures were drawn.
