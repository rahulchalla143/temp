Goal vancomycin level is [**9-8**].
She has frequent partial complex seizures consisting of an altered level of consciousness with no clear evidence on EEG of any electrographic changes.
An EEG in [**2176**] revealed very frequent runs of bifrontal central high amplitude spike and slow wave discharges lasting up to 3-4 minutes at times, almost evolving into a focal status involving both frontocentral regions.
Her MR scan showed left cerebral atrophy.
Neuropsych evaluation showed slow processing speech, impaired language function, and poor memory.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  [**Known firstname **] lives with her boyfriend and 2 daughters, ages 3 and 10.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure 135/75, heart rate 84, respiratory rate 20, temperature 101.4.
Neurologic exam - the patient was very sleepy, having had just received 1 mg of ativan.
V and VII - her corneal reflex was intact bilaterally.
Motor exam was hampered by the patient's sleepiness.
DTRs 1+ throughout.
Coordination, sensation and gait testing were not performed.
Her exam continued to be marked by frequent right face twitching consistent with a history of seizures.
An EEG obtained on [**2-2**] showed that she was having frequent seizures from her left motor strip.
Her initial hematocrit was 24 with low iron studies.
A head CT was performed because she was having high fevers.
On [**2-4**], an NG tube was placed, and the patient was started on feeds, as well as giving her medicines.
She continued to spike fevers with negative blood cultures.
Her blood and urine cultures remained negative throughout the hospitalization.
Also, because her hematocrit was 23.7, she was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**2-4**].
Because of the need to prevent seizures during the brain mapping, the patient did receive an IV load of Dilantin, as well as a po load, to keep her level between 15 and 20.
She had some diarrhea, and a C. diff culture was sent which was negative.
The sensitivity is currently pending at this point.
However, because of the likelihood that she will need long-term vancomycin therapy, a PICC line was placed on [**2-15**], and placement confirmed by chest x-ray.
