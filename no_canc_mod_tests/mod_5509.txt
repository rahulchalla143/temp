Blood and urine cultures negative .
Cardiac catheterization: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated filling pressures with mRAP of 14 mmHg and mPCWP of 32 mmHg.
The Fick calculated cardiac output and cardiac index were slightly reduced at 3.9 L/min and 2.2 L/min/m2, respectively.
PORTABLE AP CHEST AT 8:05: No prior studies are available for comparison.
Her anti-hypertensives were titrated to control her blood pressure.
Her echo showed very mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, mild aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation.
Her EKG revealed NSR with a rate of 75 and non-specific T wave changes at discharge.
She will follow up with her PCP to have her LFTs checked in 1 month as she is on a Statin and a fibrate, and next week to have her HCT and lytes checked.
She was started on metoprolol as mentioned above and her heart rate was stable in NSR with rates in 60's-70's by discharge.
CXR did not reveal any pulmonary edema.
She will follow up with her PCP to have her LFTs checked in 1 month.
Change in mental status: Neurology consult was obtained and recommended MRI which was negative for bleed.
Blood cultures, urine cultures and CXR were negative.
Iron studies and coags were unremarkable.
Her HCT bumped appropriately and remained stable.
You can continue your gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily but should have your liver function tests checked by your primary doctor in [**3-5**] weeks as lipitor was added to you regimen and can cause an increase in liver enzymes in combination with gemfibrozil.
Followup Instructions: You should follow-up with your primary care doctor Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**]  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8506**] on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**7-28**] at 11:15 am to check your blood pressure and to check your blood electrolytes and hematocrit.
