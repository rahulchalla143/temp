This prompted her to get to [**Hospital3 **], where they found her hct to be 31 and plt 146.
She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation, and in the ED her hct was found to be 27 and plt down to 75 with an INR of 1.6.
In the MICU, she underwent EGD which showed [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear at GE juncion.
Hct remained stable after 3 unit transfusion [**8-27**] and [**8-28**] and now being called out to the floor.
Floor course (#1): As pt also complained of a severe cough and was noted to have a h/o + PPD, her sputum was sent for AFBx3, which were ultimately negative.
Two sets of cardiac enzymes (checked [**2-6**] depressions in V5-6) were negative.
CT angio was negative for PE.
Pt also developed a rising fever curve, from 99's, then up to 102 and 104 with rigors and hypotension (SBP 90s, baseline in 130s), and tachycardia (110s-130s).
MICU course (#2): Urine and blood Cx eventually grew pansensitive E. coli.

HCT stable after EGD and pt symptom free.
Her INR was 1.6 at presentation and is currently 1.3; this may be related to underlying liver disease.
Blood and urine culture from [**9-1**] showed e.coli (pansensitive).
Repeat blood and urine have been negative thus far (most recent blood/urine drawn: [**9-4**] at ~9:30 for low grade temp).
Pertussis was entertained and the culture and PCR are pending as of discharge.
Given history of living in an area with endemic ehrlichia, antibody was sent and is pending upon discharge.
Viral load 629,000.
She does have some transaminities (with AST:ALT ratio >2:1), an elevated INR, low albumin (currently 3.1) and platelets (70s) and some ascites, all indicative of liver pathology.
Hematocrits were followed and were stable upon discharge.
Quinine was held and platelets were followed.
Initially, CIWA scale was used and per ICU she did not require much ativan.
