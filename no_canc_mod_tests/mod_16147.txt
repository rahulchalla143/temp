There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %) (Quantitative biplane EF 41%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Resting hemodynamics recorded during AF with a ventricular rate of 90, demonstrated elevated left and right sided filling pressures (mean PCW 29 mmHg, RVSP 68 mmHg, RVEDP 12mmHg).
The calculated cardiac index was 2.6 l/min/m2.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
[**2159-8-4**] Chest CT Scan: 1.
If no prior studies are available for comparison, FDG - PET/CT can be performed to further evaluate this nodule.

She underwent right and left heart catheterization which found minimal coronary artery disease and revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension and moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Given the above findings, cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation was performed.
Preoperative evaluation was otherwise unremarkable and she was cleared for surgery.
She was transferred to the intensive for further hemodynamic monitoring.
