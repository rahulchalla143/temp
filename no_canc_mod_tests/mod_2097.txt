[**5-31**] CT Cspine- IMPRESSION: 1.
[**5-31**] CT head- IMPRESSION: 1.
Slightly increased size of lateral ventricles when compared to the most recent prior study performed six hours earlier with increased subarachnoid hemorrhage layering in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**6-1**] Head CT- 1.
[**6-2**] EEG This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of the presence of a severe diffuse encephalopathy manifest by diffuse voltage suppression and loss of fast frequencies over all head regions but showing asymmetry in the right occipital pole.
CTA Head [**6-4**] 1.
TCD [**2164-6-5**] Mildly abnormal TCD evaluation.
TCD [**2164-6-6**] Mildly abnormal TCD evaluation.
CXR [**2164-6-6**] ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube can be traced to the upper stomach but the tip is indistinct.
TCD [**2164-6-7**] Mildly abnormal TCD evaluation.
CXR [**2164-6-7**] Unchanged appearance.
Probably left basal atelectasis and/or effusion  CXR [**2164-6-8**] Lines and tubes are in standard position.
TCD [**2164-6-8**] Abnormal TCD evaluation.
This represents a marked worsening compared to the TCD results from [**2164-6-7**].
Clinical correlation is needed  CTA head [**2164-6-8**] 1.
CTA head [**2164-6-9**] 1.
Otherwise, unchanged exam with subarachnoid hemorrhage and bilateral subdural collections  CXR [**2164-6-9**] Compared to the exam from the prior day, there is no significant  interval change.
CT head [**2164-6-10**] 1.
EEG [**2164-6-11**] This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of a severe diffuse encephalopathy.
TCD [**2164-6-11**] Abnormal TCD evaluation.
CXR [**2164-6-11**] As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
The monitoring and support devices are in constant position.
CT head [**2164-6-11**] 1.
CXR [**2164-6-13**] There are low lung volumes.
CT head [**2164-6-13**] Unchanged position of the right frontal approach internal ventricular drain catheter with slightly increased adjacent pneumocephalus.
subdural fluid collections, increased since the initial study of [**2164-5-31**]-?
CXR [**2164-6-14**] As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
The monitoring and support devices are constant.
subdural fluid collections as described above, better characterized on the prior CT head studies.
Evaluation for marrow edema from trauma or ligamentous injury or cord signal intensity changes is limited given the lack of sagittal STIR and axial T2-weighted sequence.
The patient will be brought back, for the additional sequences, which will be performed as a separate study.
[**6-16**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: 1.
Bihemispheric subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage, subdural hematomas have not significantly changed since the prior study.
[**6-16**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: 1.
Similar appearance of air and blood products around the course of the ventriculostomy catheter within the right frontal parenchyma.
Strict SBP less < 130 parameters was initiated and she was kept NPO.
An EVD was placed at 15cm h20 and a CT was performed which confirmed good placement.
In the am of [**5-31**] she underwent a cerebral angiogram and coiling of a left Pcomm artery aneurysm.
A portable Head CT was performed in the AM [**6-1**] which revealed a new hemorrhage along the EVD track and increased SDH.
An Echo and EEG were also requested.
The Echo showed LVEF>55%, and the EEG showed diffuse encephalopathy with no evidence of clinical seizures.
Overnight, ICPs were stable [**9-16**] and EVD draining adequately.
His drain remains at 20 and TCDs are negative for vasospasm.
On [**6-8**], The External Ventricular Drain was at 20 H2O CM above the tragus.
ICP were [**11-17**].
A CTA  was performed which was consistent with spasm R MCA & basilar arteries.
On [**6-9**], The External Ventricular Drain stopped draining.
A NCHCT was performed which was stable and did not show any hydrocephalas.
The serum BUN was noted to be  40 which was elevated from the mid 20s on [**6-4**].
WBC was slightly elevated at 13.4.
The EVD stopped draing at 0600, 1200, and 4pm and each time TPA was instilled in the line for 20 mints to obtain patency.A NCHCT was performed which was stable.
The serum BUN was improved to 33.
The WBC improved to 12.3  A TCD was performed which showed right MCA spasm which was stable when compared to [**6-8**].
The External Ventricular Drain was lowered to 10 H2O mmhg above the tragus.
An EEG was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity and to evaluate the further requirment of keppra.
The EEG was consistent with no seizures.
His ICP waveform was dampened at 011 on [**6-12**] and it was flushed with return of waveform.
On [**6-12**] his exam remained poor overall, his drain output began to slow and tPA was instilled at 1430, clamped for 30 mins, and when re-opened there was brisk drainage of CSF.
Head CT to confirm placement was performed.
On [**6-14**] CSF was sent and MRI head and C-SPINE imaging was done.
MRI revealed multiple small infarcts but nothing to explain mental status.
His neurological exam remained unchanged.
This was infused after a Head CT was performed and stable.
At approx 8:30AM the patients blood pressure rose to over 200, ICP increased to 70's with a wave form.
Neurological exam was stable but the patient was taken for a stat Head CT. CT revealed new acute IVH.
