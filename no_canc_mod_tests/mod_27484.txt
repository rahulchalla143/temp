[**2150-9-8**] 2:20 pm URINE CULTURE (Final [**2150-9-9**]): NO GROWTH.
EKG [**2150-9-8**]: Tracing #1: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2150-4-29**] no significant change.
EKG [**2150-9-8**]: Tracing #2: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of same date no significant change.
EKG [**2150-9-8**]: Tracing #3: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of same date no significant change.
EKG [**2150-9-8**]: Tracing #4: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of same date no significant change.
CXR [**2150-9-8**]: IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
CTA [**2150-9-8**]: IMPRESSION: Limited study due to technique.
CT HEAD [**2150-9-8**]: IMPRESSION: No definite acute intracranial abnormality.
UGI AIR w/o KUB: [**2150-9-10**]: IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: Small amount of penetration into the vestibule.
# HYPOTENSION: SBP 106 at ED triage, dropped to 80s after nitro SL, and stable in 100-110s after 3L IVF.
SBP in 100-110s is likely relative hypotension given her h/o HTN.
Initial concern for ACS, aortic dissection, or PE, but CE negative and stable, ECG unchanged from prior, and CTA negative.
Volume depletion is possible but pt does not seem overtly volume down on exam or labs.
WBC down and lymphocytosis on [**9-9**], so viral infection is possible.
Blood loss possible given GERD symptoms and Hct down from 39.1 on [**6-23**] from 39.1 to 33 at admission and to 30.7 on [**9-9**].
Thus, GI bleed in setting of gastritis is possible, but she denies changes to bowel movement, guaiac was negative,and Hct has stabilized.
Random cortisol level was low but pt responded appropriately to cosyntropin stimulation test.
Blood pressures remained stable and at discharge was 138/86.
As noted, cardiac etiology less likely given unchanged EKG and negative CE.
Should follow up with outpatient cardiologist to see if catheterization is planned.
Barium swallow was performed showing no obstruction or esophageal pathology.
Your blood pressure normalized after we withheld your medications and gave you fluids and can be restarted.
