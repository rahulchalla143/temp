The patient's abdominal CAT scan showed severe pancolitis, no evidence of toxic megacolon, consistent with Clostridium difficile infection.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 97.6, pulse 106, blood pressure 123/87, respirations 16, 94% on 3 liters.
HEENT - pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Bilateral DP and PT pulses not palpable.
LABS:  White count 38.7, hematocrit 36.3, platelets 345, sodium 131, potassium 3.4, chloride 97, bicarb 21, BUN 36, creatinine 2.1, platelets 80, calcium 8.3, phosphorus 3.7, magnesium 1.6, lactate 0.8.
Negative stool, blood and urine cultures.
Chest x-ray - right lung base linear atelectasis.
The patient was closely monitored for signs of toxic megacolon by serial abdominal exam and daily KUBs.
The next day, the patient's white blood cell count increased to 40 with 12% bands.
The patient was started on IV Flagyl, and the following day was given a trial of IVIG with interval improvement in white count and metabolic acidosis.
The patient was put on bowel rest and was decompressed with a nasogastric tube for one day, and with rectal tube for the duration of three days with interval improvement in colonic distention as evidenced by clinical exam and radiographic confirmation.
However, the patient's oxygenation had remained normal, and ABG analysis showed no hypocarbia or hypoxia.
There were no infiltrates on chest x-ray, and chest CT was performed which showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
This was attributed to likely mild congestive heart failure in light of interval decrease of ejection fraction, as was found during this admission by echocardiogram, which showed an ejection fraction of 40% which was an interval decrease from more than 55% in [**2106**].
Of note, the patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative.
He required several IV pushes of diltiazem, but his rate was controlled well on diltiazem 180 mg po qd.
Subsequently, the patient remained uvolemic, and his creatinine was followed closely when the patient was started on lasix for congestive heart failure.
