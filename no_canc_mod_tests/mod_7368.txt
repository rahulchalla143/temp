Initial vitals at [**Hospital1 487**] were rectal temp 97, oxygen sats 90 with bagging (pulse noted in nursing note and HR 40 in sinus brady).
On arrival to our ED, initial vitals with BP 80/50, T 99.9, HR 80, and O2 sat 100% (on vent).
Central venous access was placed (right subclavian) and the patient was placed on dopamine with increase in blood pressures to 120s-130s systolic.
He received a total of 3 L NS and 1 L LR.
Recent PCP visit in [**2-7**] notes oxygen saturation 83% on room air at rest and 79% on room air with ambulation.

He was initially continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, levofloxacin, vancomycin), vanc d/c'd on [**4-18**], cefepime d/c'd on [**4-20**] as sputum culture came back pneumococcus sensitive to levofloxacin.
Sputum culture +S.
