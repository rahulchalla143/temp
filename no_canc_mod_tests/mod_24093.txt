The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Sedation was lightened to perform a neuro exam and the patient was noted to be shivering and overbreathing the ventilator.

- CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2101-4-10**] 3:15 AM IMPRESSION: Cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2101-4-11**] at 11:24:57 AM FINAL Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
- CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2101-4-11**] 1:09 PM FINDINGS: Frontal view of the chest is compared to prior study from [**2101-4-10**].
PORT Study Date of [**2101-4-12**] 7:15 AM IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.
- CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2101-4-12**] 7:51 AM IMPRESSION: Left small effusion and basilar atelectasis.
In addition, there was an increase in the burst suppression index also occurring at 10:30 a.m. and 2 p.m.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm between 90-100 bpm.
In the setting of trauma, CT spine should be obtained to assess for possible underlying fractures.
- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2101-4-20**] 7:25 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube, and the right subclavian line are in unchanged position.
Brief Hospital Course: 52M with no significant PMH who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after Cardiac Arrest post sexual activity with seizure-like activity.
# s/p Cardiac Arrest: The patient was transferred to the CCU from OSH for Arctic Sun cooling protocol in the setting of recent cardiac arrest and poor neurologic status.
His cardiac markers were only slightly elevated on admission with TropT 0.44 and CK MB 39, with the tropinin trending downwards, attributed to the patient's receiving CPR as well as shocks.
cardiac cath was deferred secondary to poor outcome secondary to neurologic status.
His ECHO showed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function without any evidence of focal wall motion abnormality.
Patient was monitored on telemetry and noted to remain in a normal sinus rhythm.
Final read from Head CT in house showed small sulci and poor grey/white differentiation, suspicious for global hypoperfusion and infarction.
An MRI showed diffusion abnormality involving bilateral occipital and parietal cortex and bilateral thalami, concerning for global hypoxia/hypoperfusion injury.
# Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Presumed secondary cardiac arrest; there was concern initally for [**Doctor Last Name **] given the P/F ratio less than 300, which the patient continued to have during his hospitalization; his ventilator settings were titrated to maintain low tidal volumes.
# Central DI: Near the end of the patient's hospitalization, he was noted to start having urine output nearing 400 cc urine/hr.
Urine lytes were checked and were consistent with central diabetes insipitus; the patient was started on ddAVP to help control urine output, as well as to help control the climbing hypernatremia which was resulting from his DI.
