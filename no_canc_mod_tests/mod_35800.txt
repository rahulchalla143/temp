Cardiac catherization showed left main disease and diffues 3VD.
He was started on captopril 12.5 tid (in lieu of lisinopril 5 qd), atorvistatin 40 mg qd, metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80 for a ballon pump, and a nitroglycerin drip 0.5-5 mg/kg/min.
Due to his chest pain at rest, will check 3 sets of cardiac enzymes to rule out acute MI.
His ejection fraction is 55% and he appears euvolemic, therefore, his pump function seems adequate.
Will check UA, CXR, and EKG for pre-op evaluation.
