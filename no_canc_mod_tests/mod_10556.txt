His initial vitals in the emergency room were T 100.0, HR 100, BP 191/103, RR 16, satting 100% on RA.
Labs were notable for white count of 4.5 with normal differential, hematocrit of 29.4 (from baseline mid to high 30s), and platelets of 259.
Initial electrolytes showed a sodium of 127, bicarb of 24, BUN of 47, and creatinine of 11.2.
Anion gap was 18.
Blood acetone level was "moderate" and urinalysis was not obtainable as patient was not making urine.
A repeat chemistry panel at time of admission showed an anion gap narrowed to 17, with serum glucose of 311 (down from 448).
Vitals at time of admission are T 98, HR 88, BP 150/85, RR 20, 100% on room air.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 40897**] for nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
He was initially admitted to the medical ICU with anion gap of 25.
He was placed on insulin drip at 7u/h with finger sticks q1h and later transitioned to glargine and lispro sliding scale.
Notably, an [**Date range (1) 461**] during that admission showed an EF of 30-35% with global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis.
He followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology clinic about one week prior to this and according to that note, there is plan for cardiac catheterization and repeat [**Last Name (STitle) 461**].

Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):  [**2145-12-21**] cxr FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-19**], there is still substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
DKA: Unclear precipitant without signs of cardiac ischemia (given cardiac history) or infection.
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain: Known history of gastroparesis on gastric emptying study [**5-/2137**] vs sxs of DKA.
No fevers, WBC count, or diarrhea to suggest infectious etiology.
Systolic congestive heart failure: Per recent cards note, suspect non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and plan per consult this month was to proceed with cardiac catheterization.
Anemia: Baseline in the 30's but seen to be mid 20's this admission, likely due to some element of hemodilution, end stage renal disease, and iron study labs suggestive of ACD.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Reticulocyte count <2.0.
Regardless, your blood sugars and acid levels were improved by discharge and you should be sure to follow up closely with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 978**] at the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center.
