On [**2190-12-15**], the milrinone was discontined and the patient was changed to hydral/imdur with a goal SBP of 100-110.
The patient continued to diurese ~500cc/day but then his creatinine began to rise.
However, pt began to make urine again and his creatinine began to trend down.
Of note, pt underwent an echo on [**7-4**] showing a LVEF of 35-40%, global hk, 3+ MR, 1+ AI, dilated LA, RA, LV.
His ACEi was stopped following the episode of acute on chronic renal failure.
However, it was restarted after his creatinine had trended down with no rebound elevation of the creatinine.
His AV delay was decreased to 180ms for full BiV pacing.
The pt's coags continued to be followed very closely with a goal INR between 2 and 3.
He was admitted with a creatinine in the mid 3's which remained stable until late in his time in the unit after aggressive diuresis with a peak of 4.2.
Once diuresis was stopped, the creatinine dropped back down to the 3's.
2 days after his angiography/stenting of his PVD, the creatinine sharply rose peaking at 9.3 on [**12-25**] with anuria.
His creatinine improved dramatically since that time and the pt continued to have good urine output.
At the time of discharge, the pt's creatinine was stable between 2.7 and 2.8.
A swab of the wound revealed MRSA.
TSH on [**2190-12-17**] was 3.4. .
8) Type 2 DM - Continued home insulin ([**1-2**] when NPO) plus RISS which was increased as needed depending on blood sugar levels.
9) Psych - Pt was continued on ambien for sleep and citalopram.
Electrolytes were followed closely and repleted as needed.
Citalopram 10mg qday 3.
ASA 81mg qday 5.
Procainamide 750 q6h 10.

Outpatient Lab Work You need to have a PT, PTT, INR, and vancomycin level checked on [**2191-1-6**].
You are going to have labs drawn by [**Hospital 269**] on Thursday [**2191-1-6**].
