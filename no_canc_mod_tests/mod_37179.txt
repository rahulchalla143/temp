Medicine nightfloat's exam at that time found the pt was fluent, using both hands to roll toilet paper ([**Name8 (MD) **] RN), able to ambulate back to bed.
Brief neurologic exam at that time was absent for any facial palsy.
Neurology Resident examination at this time revealed NIHSS of 13 for left arm > leg hemiparesis, profound left sided neglect/inattention, facial droop, slight dysarthria.
Pt was brought for STAT head CT/CTA/CT perfusion revealing proximal R ICA occlusion just prior to bifurcation with prolonged MTT on perfusion images in R MCA territory.
Past Medical History: Coronary Artery Disease s/p stent placement; MI in [**1-/2140**] S/p appendectomy S/p cataract surgery Transient isolated third nerve palsy- ([**2140**]) thought [**2-10**] diabetes, resolved fully by the time the pt was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] at [**Hospital1 18**] neurology.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.

Please note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for detection of acute brain ischemia  Brief Hospital Course: NEURO 87yo woman with HTN, Hyperlipidemia, CAD, recent ERCP with biliary stent placement aditted to the medicine service [**5-9**] with UTI who developed acute onset left hemiparesis and left sided neglect.
Her neurologic exam is notable for left hemiparesis, profound left sided neglect and anosognosia.
NCHCT negative, but CTA/perfusion with large R ICA thrombus and prolonged MTT in R MCA territory.
Mechanism was probably cardioembolic as she has atrial fibrillation and was not on heparin or coumadin and INR was sub therapeutic.
Heparin gtt was at 600 units per hour at the time of [**Name (NI) **] and PTT goal should be 50-70 until INR is therapeutic (2 to 3).
CARDIO Her bloodpressures were stable without further interventions or changes in her bloodpressure medications.
Her ECHO and EKG were stable, see "results".
Neurologic examination notable for mild left hemiparesis and left hemineglect.
