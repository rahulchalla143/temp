The hematocrit stabilized at 36 to 38.
Differential 67 neutrophils, 27 bands, 6 lymphocytes, 0 monocytes.
On [**2188-1-27**] the sodium was 118 on admission two P.M. on [**2188-1-27**] and was 132 on [**2188-1-28**] at one A.M. For the remainder of the hospital it was 135 to 143 except when she was fluid restricted on [**2188-1-29**] and [**2188-1-30**] when her sodium was 151 and 150.
Chest x-ray on [**2188-1-27**] - Lungs are clear.
Chest x-ray on [**2188-1-29**]  - Large area of predominately air space opacity in the right lung consistent with pneumonia / aspiration.
CT scan of head on [**2188-1-27**] - Focal low density in the posterior left frontal lobe subcortical region which could represent a small focal infarct, inflammatory lesion or brain abscess.
MRI of head on [**2188-1-29**] - Inappropriate prominence of sulci and ventricles, a well defined area of T1 and flair hypointensity and T1 hyperintensity seen adjacent to a sulcus in the left frontal lobe which is unchanged from previus study.
MRI with gadolinium on [**2188-2-4**] - A well defined area of T1 and flair hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity seen adjacent to a sulcus in the left posterior frontal lobe which is unchanged.
Urine electrolytes on [**2188-1-27**] BUN 79, creatinine 13, sodium less than 10, chloride less than 20.
On [**2188-2-1**] urine creatinine 15, sodium 21.
On [**2188-2-2**] urine creatinine 40, sodium 23.
On [**2188-2-4**] urine creatinine 30, sodium 19, potassium 23, chloride 33.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Impression and plan for a 44 year-old woman with extensive psychiatric history and history of lithium use brought to the Emergency Department because of unresponsiveness and because she was found to have a sodium of 118.
Toxic ingestion was considered as a cause of her mental state, however her tox screen was positive only for benzodiazepines.
RENAL - The patient's hyponatremia of [**2188-1-18**] quickly corrected to 130 on the day of admission and subsequently was normal throughout the remainder of the hospitalization except when she was fluid restricted and her sodium was 150 to 151.
A trial of DDAVP was attempted but it did not increase the concentration of her urine.
When the patient's fluid intake was not restricted she continued to drink copious amounts of water and her sodium remained at normal levels from 145 to 153.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE -  It is not clear what the patient's initial fever on admission was.
Based on her chest x-ray it is possible that she may have had an aspiration pneumonia at the time of her initial event.
NEUROLOGIC - The patient's likely seizure was probably due to a setting of hyponatremia as well as her fever.
The patient was evaluated by the Neurology service and a head MRI was performed to rule out pituitary mass as the cause of her diabetes insipidus.
Of note is that when she received her head MRI she did require conscious sedation owing to anxiety.
