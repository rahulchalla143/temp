- Urine culture [**2167-8-25**]: PENDING AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE  IMAGING/STUDIES CXR ([**8-18**]) IMPRESSION: Increased bilateral moderate pleural effusions with compressive lower lobe atelectasis, with probable mild CHF.
CXR ([**8-22**]) n the interim, there has been placement of bibasilar pigtail catheters with markedly reduction of bilateral pleural effusions.
CXR ([**8-23**])  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged compared with [**2167-8-22**].
However, the bilateral effusions seen on [**2167-8-22**] exam have diminished in size.
CXR [**2167-8-24**]  No significant change in upper zone pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion, cardiomegaly, and small bilateral pleural effusions.

ACTIVE ISSUES: #Acute on chronic CHF and bilateral pleural effusions: Pt was admitted in [**6-/2167**] and ECHO at that time showed LVEF Of 30-35%.
CXR on admission showed pleural effusions (singificantly increased in size from prior imaging in [**Month (only) 116**]) and pulmonary edema consistent with CHF exacerbation.
Physical exam also consistent with volume overload with severe lower extremity peripheral edema.
Repeat echocardiogram showed regional LV wall motion abnormality with EF of ~25%.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted and bilateral pigtail catheters were insterted and drained a total of 1.5L of pleural fluid which was culture negative (AFB culture only pending at the time of discharge).
Upon discharge patient was euvolemic on exam, symptomatically improved, with oxygen saturations on room in in the mid 90s.
Dischrage CXR showed resolution of pulmonary edema with small residual effusions, significantly improved since admission.
In the future, amiodarone may be considered if there is poor rate control with current dose of metoprolol succinate as blood pressures may not tolerate further uptitration.
ABG shows pCO2 41 with pO2 63 suggesting that somnolence is related to hypoxia rather than hypercarbia.
She did have an episode of confusion in the evening of [**2167-8-25**] in the setting of low blood pressure to systolic of 90 (other vitals including temperature and O2 sat were stable).
Her PM beta blocker was held, and U/A and culture were rechecked.
# UTI: Pt had urine culture positive for pan-sensitive E. coli.
She had repeat U/A with urine culture checked on [**2167-8-25**], and this showed 154 WBC, +LE, -nitrites, -bacteria, +yeast.
CULTURE FROM [**2167-8-25**] WAS PENDING AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE.
The following day the INR was 7.
EKG on admision shows STD in V3-V6 which are likely related to LV strain in the setting of LVH and tachycardia.
Cardiac enzymes peaked at CKMB 8 and troponin 0.28.
- Pleural fluid (left and right side) AFB cultures were pending at the time of discharge (AFB smear negative) - Urine culture from [**2167-8-25**] pending at the time of discharge (U/A from [**2167-8-25**] showed 154 WBC, +LE, -nitrites, -bacteria, +yeast) - For her systolic heart failure, she should be started on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient as blood pressures allow.
Her metoprolol succinate has been uptitrated to 200 mg PO daily but may require further titration depending on blood pressure and rates while in atrial fibrillation.

In the meantime, we have changed the furosemide to torsemide to help keep the fluid from reaccumulating.
