Admission Date:  [**2135-5-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2135-6-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2075-12-27**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from outside hospital for evaluation and pericardiocentesis.
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarct at that time; however, developed shortness of breath and bilateral pleural effusions, at which time she was transferred to another outside hospital where cardiac catheterization showed clean coronary arteries but increased right-sided pressures.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and showed an EF of [**10-17**]% and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on a dobutamine drip for a heart transplant and evaluation for her cardiac transplant here.
She had a PA catheter placed and was found to have a CVP of 9, PA pressure of 42/22, cardiac output 4.5, and index of 2.5.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to evaluate for endocarditis due to her persistent fevers and revealed a very large pericardial effusion.
Her blood pressure dropped to 84/53 and her oxygen saturations decreased to 88% on room air and, therefore, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for pericardiocentesis.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were performed and all found to be negative.
A CT of the chest was performed which showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bilateral small pleural effusions and a 1 by 3 cm infiltrate in the right middle lobe which did not have an appearance of pneumonia.
She had the transthoracic echocardiogram which is as described above which noted a 1.5 cm circumferential effusion with some RA collapse but no RV collapse.
Cardiomyopathy, nonischemic, diagnosed in [**2135-3-29**] with an EF 10-15%.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2135-4-6**] at outside hospital showing clean coronary arteries, increased right-sided pressure with RA pressure of 18, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 23-29, cardiac output 2.3 and index 1.37.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2135-4-11**] at [**Hospital1 18**] showed EF 10-15%, left ventricular hypokinesis, anterior septal akinesis, small pericardial effusion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs: Temperature 102.8, blood pressure 97/60 with inspiration 98/58, heart rate 118, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 96% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Chest:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally except for decreased breath sounds at the bilateral bases.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 13.1 with normal differential and no bandemia, hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 36.1, MCV 98, platelets 336,000.
PT 15.8, PTT 29.5, INR 1.6.
Sodium 133, potassium 4.4, chloride 96, bicarbonate 24, BUN 12, creatinine 1.1, AST 13, ALT 6, LDH 198, alkaline phosphatase 112, amylase 70, total bilirubin 0.5, total protein 6.9, albumin 3.1, calcium 9.6, phosphorus 4.1, magnesium 1.9.
TSH 6.5, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, rheumatoid factor negative.
CRP 10.88, significantly elevated.
Blood cultures:  No growth times five sets.
EKG on admission showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 104, normal axis, normal intervals with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities in V4-V6.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of pericardial effusion and possible pericardiocentesis.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed while in the Cardiac Catheterization Holding Area which was found to show no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade with anterior portions of pericardial fluid loculated an echodense.
Her blood pressure was checked and she was found to have no evidence of pulsus paradoxus.
She remained hemodynamically stable for the first three days of her hospitalization with heart rate ranging from 90s to low 110s with occasional tachycardia in the 130s to 140s.
Her blood pressure was in the 90-110/40-60 range which was near her baseline.
Her oxygenation remained well at 95% on room air.
On [**2135-5-30**], hospital day number three, she was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and had a right heart catheterization performed which showed cardiac output of 4.5, cardiac index 2.5, PA pressure of 44/27, and no evidence of equalization of pressures.
The following day, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 60s and was started on dopamine on the floor.
After initiation of 5 micrograms per kilogram per minute of dopamine, her blood pressure increased to approximately 85-90 and she was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit.
While in the CCU, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed early unchanged pericardial effusion which was moderate in size, measuring less than 1 cm inferior to the left ventricle, 1-1.5 cm lateral to the left ventricle, less than 0.5 cm around the LV apex and anterior to the right ventricle and greater than 2 cm anterior to the right atrium.
The Swan-Ganz catheter measured her wedge pressure to be 20, RA pressure of 17, and SVR 730 with an elevated cardiac output of 7.4.
This was slightly different from numbers during right heart catheterization the day before.
She was off dopamine approximately 12 hours of initiation with stable systolic blood pressures in the 100-120 range.
On [**2135-6-3**], a CT-guided pericardiocentesis was performed by Radiology, at which time 15 cc of fluid was removed.
Analysis of this fluid showed a total protein of 5.2 and an LDH of 648.
There were 0 red blood cells and 3,100 white blood cells which showed 90% neutrophilic predominance.
Cytology showed no evidence of malignant cells.
AFB stain was performed on fluid as well as Gram's stain culture, fungal culture, all were found to be negative.
However, it is suspected to be a viral pericarditis/myocarditis; however, the [**Location (un) **], Adenovirus, Histoplasmosis serologies were all pending at the time of this dictation.
A Mycoplasma IgM and IgG were both negative as well.
On [**2135-6-4**], twenty-four hours after pericardiocentesis, a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed resolution of the pericardial effusion with stable EF of less than 20%.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled during this hospitalization and were negative times three sets.
She had some chest discomfort during this hospitalization which was thought secondary to her large effusion rather than ischemia given her normal coronary arteries per cardiac catheterization two months prior.
For the three days prior to discharge, she was felt to be volume overloaded and was run negative with a decrease in her weight of approximately 2 kilograms.
Her oxygen saturations were 95% on room air and decreased to 90-91% with ambulation.
Her digoxin level, TSH and chemistry panel were checked following these episodes and were found to be within normal limits except for mildly elevated TSH given her hypothyroidism.
She had blood cultures performed on five different occasions and were found to all be no growth.
A urine culture was performed when a Foley was placed in the Intensive Care Unit and was shown to be contaminated.
As she was asymptomatic from a genitourinary point of view, it was not felt that her urine culture was the source of her spiking fevers.
The Infectious Disease team was consulted while she was in the Intensive Care Unit given her Swan numbers of increased cardiac output to 7.3 and a decreased SVR to around 700 for evaluation of infectious etiology of her pericardial effusion and hemodynamic instability.
She was not felt to be septic and the Infectious Disease Team recommended viral serologies for evaluation of the pericardial effusion.
Urine Histoplasma antigen was checked as well as [**Location (un) **] A and B and Adenovirus which is pending at the time of this dictation.
As described above, once pericardiocentesis was performed, pericardial fluid was Gram's stain negative, culture negative, and AFB negative.
PULMONARY: During evaluation for fever of unknown origin, she had a CT scan of her torso which showed enlarged right tracheal lymph node measuring 1.8 by 2.1 cm and multiple other prominent right paratracheal lymph nodes as well as multiple subcentimeter prominent lymph nodes in the perivascular space and the aorticopulmonary window.
The Pulmonary Team was consulted on possible mediastinoscopy and biopsy of the larger right tracheal lymph node to evaluate for lymphoma as an etiology of her pericardial effusion.
It was the feeling of the pulmonary team as well as the congestive heart failure team that the lymph nodes were secondary to congestive heart failure and a biopsy was not indicated at this time.
She will follow-up with a repeat chest CT approximately two to three weeks after discharge for regression of lymph nodes.
If they are still present at that time, she will follow-up with the Pulmonary Team, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who will perform mediastinoscopy plus biopsy of lymph nodes.
Under ultrasound evaluation, she was found to have less than 1 cm of pleural fluid and, therefore, it was not felt that a thoracentesis was indicated.
RHEUMATOLOGY:  In evaluation of her pericardial effusions, an ESR was checked and was found to be 116 and on repeat was 115.
Compliment levels were checked and also found to be negative.
A CH50 and an ACE level are pending at this time to evaluate for sarcoidosis.
The Rheumatology Team was consulted and did not feel given her clinical history and supportive laboratory tests that she had any evidence of systemic rheumatologic disease.
The increase in her Synthroid dose also showed positive effects on blood pressure and heart rate.
A chest x-ray was performed as well and she had no evidence of elevated hemidiaphragm, ruling out phrenic nerve injury as the etiology of the pain.
Her crit remained stable throughout the hospitalization and she was given 2 units of FFP for an elevated INR.
History of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction 10-14%.
She will have a follow-up CT scan in two weeks for which she will call for a specific appointment time.
