Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[**2180-3-16**] CTA chest 1.
A 7-mm right lower lobe nodule seen on PET CT [**2179-8-2**] is not visualized on this study due to the right lower lobe atelectasis.
[**2180-3-16**] LE U/S  Duplex and color Doppler demonstrate no DVT either acute or chronic, involving both lower extremities from the common femoral through to the proximal tibial veins.
[**2180-3-17**] cardiac catheterization  1) Selective angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease.
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed markedly-elevated left-sided filling pressures, with an LVEDP of 22 mmHg.
There was moderate  pulmonary arterial hypertension, with a PA pressure of 40/23 mmHg, likely due to elevated left-sided filling pressures (low transpulmonary pressure gradient).
The cardiac output and cardiac index were preserved.
Adhesiolysis was completed until the small bowel was able to be run from the ligament of Treitz to the terminal ileum.
POD1 - The patient had good urine output, minimal NGT output, and was out of bed and ambulating.
NGT output increased and was 600cc in 8 hours so it was left in place and the patient was changed to maintenance IVF.
Her vitals were stable and she was breathing comfortably.
Her lungs sounded congested so a stat portable CXR was ordered.
The CXR was significant for right greater than left lower lobe atelectasis with low lung volumes.
Her oxygen saturations were essentially mid to high 90's throughout but the patient was on and off face mask and nonrebreather, grunting, and audibly wheezing.
Throughout this period, her sats were in the 90's with oxygen supplementation and a room air sat of 89% was recorded.
Her EKG was significant for mild ST elevations in the lateral leads and some ST depression across the precordial leads which were new compared to her ED EKG.
Her RR was 20-30, with audible grunting, and her sats were in the 90's on face mask.
CT chest PE protocol was ordered and an ICU transfer was arranged in order to better monitor the patient and her respiratory status.
A heparin gtt was started and titrated with goal PTT 50-70.
Cardiology was consulted to evaluate her EKG changes and an echocardiogram was performed which was signficant for akinesis of the middle third of the left ventricle which is not consistent with coronary artery disease and suggests regional cardiomyopathy/myocarditis or atypical stress cardiomyopathy.
Troponins were checked which were elevated and peaked at 1.09 before trending down.
The patient was plavix loaded and aspirin was started with plans for cardiac catheterization for the following day to evaluate the coronaries.
POD4 - Cardiac cath was negative for coronary artery disease but notable for markedly-elevated left-sided filling pressures and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Overall, the patient is thought to have had demand ischemia secondary to the acute stress of her episode of respiratory distress and her decreased EF is thought to be secondary to stress induced cardiomyopathy.
Her INR was 2.1, the heparin gtt was stopped, and 2.5 mg of coumadin was given.
She was set up with VNA to assist in transitioning her to home with her new medications and facilitating INR checks and coumadin dosing.

[**Name10 (NameIs) **] visiting nurses will check your INR level which tells us how thin or thick your blood is.
You will follow up with your cardiologist in 4 weeks and they will help you arrange for a repeat echocardiogram of your heart to compare it to the one that you had in the hospital and determine if they want to change any of your medications.
