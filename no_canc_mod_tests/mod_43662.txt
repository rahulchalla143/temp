Admission Date:  [**2124-3-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-3-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2049-2-9**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, aortic valve replacement times 2, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and benign prostatic hypertrophy with indwelling Foley who presented to the hospital on [**2124-3-13**] with blood in his Foley catheter.
Additionally, the patient had a bladder scan which showed a markedly distended bladder.
A new Foley was placed in and 1300 cc of urine was then obtained.
The chest pain resolved and his heart rate was controlled with a Cardizem drip.
Urinalysis in the hospital showed the urine to be red, opaque with moderate leukocytes, positive nitrates, large blood, greater than 300 protein.
His CBC at the hospital showed a white blood cell count of 4.8 with a hematocrit of 35.7 and platelets of 300.
CBC on arrival showed a significantly increased white blood cell count at 23.2 with a bandemia, 64 polys, 36 bands as well as UA consistent with urinary tract infection.
While in the MICU, the patient significantly improved with no chest pain and decreased shortness of breath and, therefore, was called out to the medical service on [**2124-3-15**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the Medical Floor, vital signs were 98.1, blood pressure was 112/50, heart rate is 80, Respiratory rate is 18, 92% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat: Anicteric, moist mucus membranes, extraocular movements are intact, pupils, equal, regular, and react to light and accommodation, difficult to assess jugular venous distention secondary to tremor.
Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border with mechanical valve opening and closing appreciated secondary to the patient's mechanical aortic valve with a rate in the 80's.
LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer, white blood cell count was 9.4, hematocrit was 30.9, platelets 233, PT was 22.2, PT-T was 51.5, INR was 3.3.
Electrolytes: Sodium 137, potassium 4.9, chloride 102, bicarb 28, BUN 35, creatinine 1.1, glucose 96, CK was 62 with troponin of less than 0.3, digoxin level was 1.2.
Blood culture from [**2124-3-14**] grew gram positive cocci in pairs and chains and the urine culture from [**2124-3-13**] grew enterococcus and the sensitivities were pending.
Blood cultures from [**2124-3-15**] were negative to date at that point.
PERTINENT STUDIES:  On [**2124-3-13**], a chest x-ray showed bibasilar opacities, significant for aspiration versus infection.
On [**2124-3-14**], chest x-ray showed significant improvement of the right lower lobe lesser extent in the left lower lobe.
Both the urine culture and the blood cultures from [**3-14**] and 5th grew out enterococcus which was resistant to Levaquin, therefore, due to the fact that the patient is allergic to penicillin, he was unable to be started on ampicillin and vancomycin was the drug of choice.
The patient remained afebrile and his white blood cell count trended down throughout his stay.
Blood cultures from [**3-16**] and 7th remained negative throughout.
Furthermore, both transthoracic echocardiogram as well as transesophageal echocardiogram were performed in order to evaluate the patient's mechanical aortic valve for potential vegetation subsequent to being bacteremic for approximately 24 to 48 hours.
Both studies were negative for any vegetation and, therefore, the patient will be discharged on a total of 3 week course of vancomycin IV.
After his weight was well controlled with the Diltiazem drip, the patient was just restarted on his Verapamil and continued on that for the remainder of the day.
The Coumadin was given based on the goal INR being 1.8 to 2.2.
The mitral valve was found to be calcified with 2+ mitral regurgitation and the prosthetic aortic valve with mechanical leaflet was found to have a 1 to 2+ paraprosthetic leak and tricuspid regurg of 1+.
Throughout the remainder of his stay, the patient's heart rate remained well controlled and was in sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial contractions.
He occasionally became short of breath along with blood transfusions which resolved after giving Lasix.
He is currently at his baseline pulmonary status with O2 sats approximately 93 to 95% on 2 liters.
However, his stools remained guaiac negative throughout his stay.
Heme:  The patient was transfused on two occasions with one unit of packed red blood cells in order to optimize his hematocrit at a level greater than 30.
He was continued on his Coumadin 5 mg q. day to keep goal INR equal to 1.8 to 2.2.
Fingerstick blood glucose was checked q.i.d.
Musculoskeletal:  Due to the significant discomfort the patient was having related to the right lower extremity hematoma and subsequent swelling of the right ankle, ankle and tibia/fibula plain x-ray films were performed.
