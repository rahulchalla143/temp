HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, status post recent total knee replacement and hip fracture in [**2162-11-25**], chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who initially presented from rehabilitation on [**2-3**] with fevers to 102 and hypoxia at 89% in the setting of oxygen saturations of 89% on room air.
During this subsequent hospital course, the patient was found to have a urinary tract infection and a questionable right lower lobe infiltrate, and blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters which subsequently grew out Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient had five days of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from [**2-2**] to [**2-7**] at which point the patient was treated initially with Vancomycin and Gentamicin.
There was on blood loss and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
In the Operating Room the patient has had an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram to further evaluate the cardiomyopathy and showed no valvular vegetation, moderate mitral regurgitation, no aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45%.
The Swan-Ganz catheter was also placed which revealed the central venous pressure of 9, PA pressure of 49/20, cardiac output of 5.12.
The patient was subsequently taken postoperatively to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and vent set on AC 600 by 14 with positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 and FIO2 of 40%.
Subsequent pathology showed acute osteomyelitis as the source.
They recommended continued coverage with Vancomycin, and Neurosurgery continued to follow the patient who recommended following the patient's mental status and neurological examination as the sedation from the ventilation was weaned off.
Bronchoscopy prior to extubation revealed a large plug that was removed from the left lobe which subsequently improved her breathing status.
The patient had subsequent blood cultures that were resent giving the rising white count of 12 on [**2-23**] and the surveillance cultures have shown no growth to date.
Amiodarone was decreased on [**2-21**], given the loading taper and the patient initially had a long QT, documented to be 490.
Subsequent decrease of the Amiodarone showed that her QTC had resolved.
Coronary - The patient was maintained on Aspirin per Neurosurgery and Cardiology recommendations and beta blocker as tolerated for her blood pressure.
Pump - Congestive heart failure, the patient had an ejection fraction of 20% per surface echocardiogram.
A transesophageal echocardiogram intraoperatively showed an ejection fraction of about 30 to 40%.
Cardiac monitoring with PA pressures showed a cardiac output of 6 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, likely due to elevated filling pressures.
Initial FENA was 6.5 with positive eosinophils on urine smear, prior to transfer to Medicine Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's creatinine continued to rise.
Renal was involved and they recommended that the patient likely needed higher pressures at the level of the kidney to produce urine with an aim of a systolic blood pressure in the 130s to 140s.
The patient was also placed on a Lasix drip for further diuresis which improved her creatinine slightly but after overdiuresis her creatinine continued to rise but plateaued until the day of this dictation.
Repeat urine eosinophil smear was negative.
Herpes simplex virus labialis - The patient was treated with Acyclovir which was discontinued on [**2-23**].
Endocrine - The patient was maintained on an insulin drip which was discontinued on [**2-23**] and tapered fingerstick blood glucose.
Delta MS - The patient had laughing mania delirium prior to transfer and on arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit she was intubated and sedated.
Magnetic resonance imaging scan was obtained which showed no acute process and she was initially started on Haldol which was subsequently discontinued given her prolonged QTC syndrome in favor of uveitis.
Will likely need further gastrointestinal follow up and colonoscopy in the future for evaluation of melena.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was subsequently maintained on tube feeds while she was intubated and planned post extubation with placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube for tube feeds.
