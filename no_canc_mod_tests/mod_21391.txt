HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 57860**] was admitted to the Platinum Surgery Service on [**2161-7-4**] and underwent an ERCP.
A sphincterotomy was performed, and the stone was extracted successfully using a balloon.
An ABG was drawn, which was essentially normal.
A chest x-ray was obtained, which showed a pleural effusion, most likely from her pancreatitis.
Another EKG was done, which showed no change from her previous EKG.
She was diuresed with Lasix, and her right chest was tapped.
Her blood sugars were consistently elevated in the 200 range.
She was therefore on an insulin drip for a short time, and then insulin was added to her TPN, which kept her blood sugars within the normal range.
On [**2161-7-18**], her imipenem was discontinued, as she had completed a 14-day course.
Throughout her hospital course, her liver enzymes had continued to decrease.
However, on [**2161-7-22**], her amylase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin all slightly increased.
On [**2161-7-25**], the patient's pain was very well controlled with oral pain medications, her liver enzymes were still falling, and she was tolerating a regular diet and p.o.
Status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
