His ECG showed inferior q's and lateral st-flattening, and the first tn was positive, so he was given asa, started on heparin, and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible intervention.
A stress test 10 yrs ago appeared the same, no catheterization.

He underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and poor LV function.
Angiography showed a right dominant system with 80% proximal stenosis in the LAD, 70% after first diagonal; 80% proximal circumflex lesion, 90% after first obtuse marginal; and mid occlusion of the RCA.
Left ventriculography showed trace MR and global HK with an LVEF of 30%.
Based on the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted for surgical revascularization.
A routine chest x-ray was notable for tiny left apical pneumothorax.
Serial chest x-rays showed complete resolution of the pneumothorax.
He was noted to have a slight increase in creatinine which remained stable at 1.6.
