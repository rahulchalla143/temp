CXR ([**2204-11-15**]) - Unchanged appearance of the chest compared to [**2200-11-25**].
EKG ([**2204-11-15**]) - NSR at 85, new TWI in V4-6.
CXR ([**2204-11-15**]) - Interval development of left lower lobe opacity.
ECHO ([**2204-11-15**]) - The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
MICRO: Stool - negative for C diff x 3; C diff B toxin pending; Giardia/crypto DFA negative Blood [**2204-11-15**] - negative URINE CULTURE (Final [**2204-12-2**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Troponin was 0.04 (with CRI) with concerning EKG (lateral ST changes).
The patient was started on lovenox (patient refused q6 PTT checks making heparin inappropriate).
The patient refused cardiac cath or any other intervention.
An ECHO 1 month ago at [**Hospital1 112**] showed an EF 55%.
A ECHO on admission here showed a new reduced EF of 35%.
Her EKG continued to show lateral/inferior TWI c/w her presentation.
Her troponins were 0.01 on discharge and never elevated beyond 0.04 on admission.
She was managed medically with a beta blocker which can be titrated up as her blood pressure allows - on discharge she is on metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], with BP ranging from 90-120 systolic.
An ACE-I was not started secondary to a reported "allergy" in the past.
An oral nitrate could also be considered.
HYPOTENSION - The patient was hypotensive on admission.
Blood/Urine/Stool cultures were sent.
She was maintained on NS overnight and her blood pressure stabalized.
Her original CXR did not show any acute pulmonary process.
A repeat CXR showed a possible LLL opacity.
A PA+Lat was performed for better visulalization of the opacity.
She had two other episodes of hypotension on this admission with SBP to the 80's.
Left upper extremity PICC placed on [**11-21**] for hydration and electrolyte repletion.
Her urine subsequently grew out Klebsiella and E. Coli, resistant to multiple drugs.
Antibiotic selection was further complicated by her penicillin allergy, and ID recommended transfer to the ICU for meropenem desensitization which was completed on [**2204-12-3**].
CRI: Her creatinine was elevated on admission at 2.1.
Her electrolytes were repleted as necessary.
She was admitted with a Na of 128 and this normalized with hydration.
Stool cultures were sent for c. diff and returned negative.
C. Diff B toxin was sent and found to be negative.
Further work-up was initiated with stool studies including giardia/camphylobacter/OP were all negative.
GI was also consulted and reccommended dietary changes (low fat/carb/lactose, small freq feedings), anti-motility agents (immodium, cholestyramine), and also suggested that her ostomy output may be w/in the normal range for a patient w/ a total colectomy.
The patient's ostomy output declined in the days prior to d/c and ranged from 700-1500cc/day with formed stool.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**11-26**] Sprays Nasal [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for dry nose.
