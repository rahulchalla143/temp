Electrocardiogram in the Emergency [**Hospital1 **] showed tall T-waves and possible J-point elevations in the anterior precordial leads.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature was 96.2 F, pulse of 80, blood pressure was 134/70.
The patient was mechanically ventilated with oxygen saturation of 96%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was normocephalic with a cut on the lower lip.
Chest examination significant for a few inspiratory wheezes; otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, nondistended, there were normoactive bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
The patient's extremities were warm, peripheral pulses were 2+.
Neurologic examination: the patient was sedated, cranial nerves examination demonstrated a positive oculocephalic and gag reflexes.
NOTABLE LABORATORY DATA:  Arterial blood gas with pH of 7.33, PaCO2 is 48, PO2 is 206.
The patient had a white blood cell count of 12.1, hematocrit of 45.6, and platelets of 278,000.
The differential was 83 neutrophils, 14 lymphocytes, 2 monocytes, and 1 eosinophils.
His Chem 7 included a sodium of 143, potassium of 3.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate of 20, BUN of 8.0, creatinine of 1.0, glucose of 99, and an anion gap of 20.
The patient also had osmotic gap of 4.0.
The patient's urinalysis indicated a few amorphic crystals, otherwise within normal limits.
Serum toxicology screen: alcohol was 148, A.S.A., Tylenol, barbiturates, benzodiazepine, and Tri-Cyclen antidepressants were negative.
Urine toxicology screen: amphetamine was positive and benzodiazepine, opiates, cocaine, and methadone were negative.
Chest x-ray indicated an endotracheal tube and orogastric tube were in place.
Serial electrocardiograms were concerning for the possible J-point elevations in the anterior precordial leads, versus repolarization abnormalities.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn which were negative.
The patient became increasingly agitated in the Intensive Care Unit and it was decided to wean the patient's sedation and extubate the patient, which was done without any difficulty.
After further consultation with Cardiology, it was decided that the electrocardiogram changes were probably benign in nature and reflected repolarization abnormality.
