Pneumonia with Sepsis: Patient presented with productive cough and CXR evidence of RLL pneumonia.
Fevers, bandemia of 40% and tachycardia were consistent with sepsis without evidence of end-organ ischemia.
Blood and urine cultures, and urinary legionella antigen were sent prior to giving antibiotics.
Urine cultures came back negative.
Patient was on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis as an outpatient and increasing to treatment dosing was considered but not pursued given CXR appearance and high oxygen saturation on room air.
Influenza DFA was checked and was negative.
Sputum for PCP was negative by immunofluorescence and a CT of the chest was inconsistent with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
Cryptococcal antigen was sent and was negative.
Toxoplasma IgM and IgG were negative.
Legionella culture was also negative.
Sputum AFB stain was negative.
After blood cultures were negative for 48 hours and the patient continued to improve clinically, the Cefepime was discontinued and the patient was transferred to the medicine service, whereupon Vanco was discontinued.
Sputum cultures were negative.
Pancytopenia: On admission patient had WBC of 2.5, hematocrit of 24.1, and platelet count of 82.
There was concern for an HIV-associated pancytopenia but also for DIC, specifically with regard to the anemia and thrombocytopenia, so DIC labs were checked but showed no signs of DIC with fibrinogen always > 200, and coags were slightly elevated on admission but remained stable with no significant elevations.
The patient did require on transfusion for a hematocrit of 19 with an appropriate bump to 24.
Stool guaiacs were negative and the change was attributed to vigorous IV hydration with a reported significant blood loss during central line placement.
BMBx was performed on [**2151-1-8**] to rule out pathology or BMInfection.
Pathology was still pending at the time of discharge but prelim results showed no abnormal cells.
Bone marrow AFB, cytogenetics, and culture were PENDING at the time of discharge, will be followed up by our hematology team here.
AM fasting cortisol was normal, TSH normal, was fluid responsive.
AFB culture (for MAC) negative x 1 (2nd culture pending).
As above, stool studies were negative though AFB culture for MAC are pending for the last stool culture.
Last CD4 count in our system was 37 in [**2146**] with CD4 of 17 this admission, and mildly recent 20 (as outpatient).
HIV VL and gentoype was sent and results are noted in the results section.
She will require prior authorization for the Atovaquone, so both her pharmacy and insurance company were [**Name9 (PRE) 653**] to expedite this and we will be notified in the next 24 hours of their decision.
Ankle x-ray was negative for fracture at [**Hospital1 18**].
Stated that blood sugars have been well-controlled recently in the 100-120s without insulin.
She was encouraged to check her sugars regularly at home and to use her Novolog sliding scale as needed.
A Bone marrow bx was done and pathology showed preliminarily did not show any abnormal cells.
However, cultures are still pending.
