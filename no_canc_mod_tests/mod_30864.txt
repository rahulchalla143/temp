He is on chronic methadone/oxycodone at his nursing home for pain and was found unresponsive w/ a respiratory rate of 4 and bp of 72/64, satting 88%, EMS was called and gave 4 mg narcan to which he responded well, however he required two additional doses for decreased respirations in the ED.
Recieved 3 L of NS for blood pressure support.
In the ED he desatted to 89-90% on 2L NC and was placed on NRB, subsequently desatted to 75-80% on NRB, lung exam ronchorous, gas at that time 7.37/48/54 and was intubated of hypoxic respiratory failure.
CXR on admission showed resolving pneumonia, shortly prior to intubation, showing worsened bibasilar infiltrates, possibly c/w aspiration.

As his mental status responded to narcan, and the patient had had a thorough work-up just two weeks prior during his prior hospitalization, it was not felt his presentation warrented head CT or LP.
B12 and folate levels were normal during prior hospitalization earlier this month.
The complete tox screen revealed Trileptal and Clozaril in his system, which were confirmed by his nursing home to be ordered for another patient on the same floor.
CXR showed bilateral consolidation and pulmonary edema.
On day 3 his urine showed psueudomonas so his antibiotic regiment was changed to Vancomycin and Meorpenam.
The Vancomycin discontinued after his MRSA screen was negative.
Right subtrochanteric fracture-he complained of R hip pain during the admission.
A bilateral hip film was done and revealed the above fracture.
His course was complicated by 500cc intraop blood loss, and postoperatively, by acute blood loss anemia and hypotension.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was done to rule out a retroperitoneal bleed.
This CT revealed two tiny hematomas, in right gluteus medius 3x2 cm and Ant Prox R thigh 3.4x 2.8cm.
He received 4 units of blood and his hematocrit subsequently stabilized.
A chest xray done at that time revealed bilateral new pleural effusions, worsening opacities and stable large bullae.
Gram stain of the ulcers showed 1+PMN, 1+GPC, 1+GNR.
UTI:  Urine culture was positive for pseudomonas.
