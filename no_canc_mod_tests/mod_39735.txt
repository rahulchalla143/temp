CT w/o contrast: CT OF THE CHEST: Compared to prior CT from [**2109-3-26**], there is almost mareked improvement in the diffuse bilateral peribronchiolar opacities.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are seen which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
IMPRESSION: Compared to the prior CT from [**2109-3-26**], there is marked improvement of the previously noted peribronchiolar opacities within both lungs.
CTA [**2109-4-14**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: 10-mm hypodense focus in the left thyroid lobe.
A rounded small pleural- based opacity in the posterior aspect of the left lung base is seen and unchanged when compared to a study dated [**2109-4-13**].
Small mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, not pathologically enlarged by CT criteria are again noted, unchanged.
His dyspnea was well controlled on reaching the floor and remained well controlled throughout his hospital stay.
His hypertension continued to be an issue following his first dialysis session, despite the removal of 5.2 L of fluid during that session.
For improved BP control, he was started on 20 mg Lisinopril per recommendation of the renal team.
Although his pressure was better controlled, he still had breaks into the 180s and his pressure control will need to be optimized as an outpatient.
# Fevers: The patient briefly spiked a fever on [**4-13**] and underwent non-con CT of the chest.
Sputum and blood cultures were negative.
The patient's non-con Chest CT demonstrated a peripheral wedge shaped opacity, and the patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn, given his relative immunosuppression and his recent hospitalization with full course of levofloxacin.
A follow-up CTA was done to rule out PE and showed complete resolution of the wedge shaped area, which presumably was simply atelectasis.
However, your blood pressure continues to be elevated at times throughout the day.
You will need to work with your clinic physicians to improve your blood pressure.
You have a cough and imaging of your chest showed that you may have a small infection.
In addition, you should check your temperature on a daily basis and any time that you feel sick.
One of your tests is still pending.
