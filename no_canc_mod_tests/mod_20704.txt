Admitted again to [**Hospital6 302**], intubated, CT showed cavitation on the L side and b/l pneumothoracies R>L, pneumomediastinum, L pleural effusion and evidence of aspiration on right.
On [**9-20**] patient trasferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hemoptysis with possible endobronchial ablative therapy.
Further evaluation with MRCP could be performed.
* Bronchial brushings and washings- negative for malignant cells, no positive cultures, no positive fungal culture * [**Hospital6 302**] sputum from suction- gram [**Last Name (un) **] with GP cocci in pairs, culture with yeast only   Brief Hospital Course: Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] pt had bronchoscopy which revealed clot in anterior segment RUL.
Blood clot was removed and BAL gram stains and cultures negative.
On [**9-22**] a second bronchoscopy was performed, multiple clots and fresh blood was found which resolved with flushing.
Pt arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] with b/l pneumothoracies, which are resolving though a small right loculated pocket remains.
While in the MICU required minimal blood support with 2 u PRBC and fluid boluses to bring up blood pressure.
Upon transfer to floor all cultures were obtained, without a single positive bacterial culture noted.
The gram stain and fluid analysis are not suggestive of empyema, but this fluid is exudative and due to higher than normal ,ynphocyte % could be related to lymphoma, therefore it will be absolutely essential to follow cytology from this fluid which is currently pending.
As on out patient it will be essential to work up incidental finding, CT abd showed retroperitoneal air and a 7x5 cm soft tissue mass.
