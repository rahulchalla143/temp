This was seen to represent a subpleural nodule on the chest CT of [**2190-2-25**] and is unchanged and therefore of no current clinical significance.
[**2-16**] ECHO Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2189-12-4**], the inferior hypokinesis may be new.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with severe [**Last Name (un) 15526**] vessel disease.
LIMA to LAD was not injected but was known to be patent from an angiogram in [**12/2192**] done at [**Hospital1 2025**] (films were reviewed).
Limited hemodynamic assessment showed normal systemic aortic pressures.
Final angiogram showed no residual stenosis with no angiographic evidence of dissection, embolization or perforation with TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.
Final angiography revealed a 50% residual stenosis with no evidence of dissection, embolization or peforation.
A recent cardiac cath at [**Hospital1 2025**] did not show evidence.
Second set of cardiac enzymes indicate troponin leak [**1-25**] MI; s/p BMS to SVG-OM1 - continue ASA, plavix, [**Last Name (un) **] - holding beta blockers given h/o asthma and bronchospasm (BB poorly tolerated in the past) - holding statin and zetia given history of intolerance (severe mylagias); started gemfibrozil which he has tolerated well .
