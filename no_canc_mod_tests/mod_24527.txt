FINDINGS: The study is mildly compromised secondary to positioning.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging was obtained through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis before and after administration of IV contrast.
High density is demonstrated on the non-contrast images within the left pleural space consistent with moderate to large hemothorax.
As described above, the celiac axis, SMA, right renal artery, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are off of the true lumen which is significantly smaller in size since the prior examination and the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta with atrophy of the left kidney and delayed opacification of the left kidney.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

A preprocedure timeout and two patient identifiers was performed.
The patient was placed prone on the CT fluoroscopic table, and a preprocedure CT was obtained.
This was compared to patient's prior study of [**2200-6-9**].
Under CT fluoroscopic guidance, after the instillation of approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine as local anesthetic, an 18-gauge needle was advanced into the collection.
Successive dilatation with 6, 7, 8 and 10 French dilators was performed.
Pigtail was formed, and a three-way stopcock was applied with a JP suction bulb.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Mild aspiration occurred during the swallow with the initial teaspoon of nectar liquid and with a cup sip of thin liquid due to reduced laryngeal valve/airway closure.
Additionally, alternating bites/sips was beneficial at clearing pharyngeal residue.
Aspiration precautions, as follows:  a.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**] is a 62 year old gentleman s/p an ascending aorta replacement at [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital 1225**] Medical Center in [**Month (only) 359**] of [**2199**] for a type A dissection which was complicated by the necessity post-operatively for a trach and PEG, renal failure, and rehab placement.
He was transferred to the surgical step down floor to allow continued antibiotics before surgical repair of his type B dissection and to fine tune his blood pressure regimen.
Another CT scan was performed which revealed that his descending aortic dissection had increased.
He was returned to the unit for tighter blood pressure control.
A swallow consult was obatained and a video swallow was performed which showed a mild oropharyngeal dysphagia currently with mild oral residue, prolonged oral transit and also decreased airway closure which contributed to trace aspiration of thin liquid.
Mr. [**Known lastname 11013**] hypertension was difficult to manage and a renal scan was performed which showed a reduced renal function bilaterally, worse on the left with very poor perfusion.
His blood pressure became much more manageable.
On [**2200-7-7**] he was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
