The following day she was taken to [**Hospital 745**] Hospital where a head CT was negative.
She had an LP there where the opening preassure was reportedly 45 and closing preassure 25 (WBC 2 normal protein); a CTA head showed superior sagital sinus thrombosis.

The MR venogram appears to confirm the absence of flow within the superior sagittal sinus, as well as both transverse sinuses.
The source images appear to show visible flow within the internal cerebral veins, vein of [**Male First Name (un) 2096**], and straight sinus, though the projected images do not reveal this latter flow as being as brisk as is normally seen.
CT Head ([**6-19**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process, specifically there is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage given anticoagulation in the setting of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis.
EEG ([**6-22**]): IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal 24-hour EEG telemetry due to bursts of bifrontal rhythmic delta activity.
She intially presented to an OSH, where she had an LP which showed opening preassure 45 and closing pressure 25 (no report on WBC or protein) and a CTA head showed superior sagital thrombosis.
She received a bolus of heparin of 500U, continued on 1000U/hour, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Hypercoaguable work up which was obtained at NWH prior to transfer was normal: homocysteine 6.9, antithrombin 3: 90, prothrombin negative, Factor V Leiden 2.5, protein C 120, protein S 91, Cardiolipin Abs: IgG 6.6, IgM 11.4, lupus AC screen negative.
Her INR was 3.0 at the time of discharge.
She was initially started on Lisinopril for hypertension during this admission, but this was discontinued at the time of discharge as her blood pressure improved as her pain was better controlled.
She was instructed to follow up with lab draws for INR at her [**Hospital 6435**] [**Hospital3 **] as an outpatient.
A 24 hour EEG showed bursts of bifrontal rhythmic delta activity which indicates an abnormality of deeper midline structures.
The patient reported symptoms of a UTI, and urine culture grew >100,000 E.coli.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on Monday, [**6-27**], Wednesday [**6-29**], and Friday [**7-1**], and have results faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82717**] 2.
Your labs did not show that your blood is hypercoaguable.
You should have your INR checked as an outpatient and faxed in to your PCP.
You were started on Coumadin 4 mg daily, and should have your INR checked on this Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and faxed to Dr.[**Name (NI) 82718**] office.
