Admission Date:  [**2171-12-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-1-8**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: "confusion", transferred from OSH with a diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement PEG tube palcement   History of Present Illness: This is a RH 84 year old woman with a past medical history significant for hypertension who presents with "confusion" and was found to have left occipital hemorrhage with intraventricular extension at [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital, placed on nitro drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.
She was sent to OSH ED where CT scan showed bleed.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam: afebrile; BP 208/107; HR 60s;  RR 18; O2 sat 100% O2 NC gen - no acute distress.

seems to be full strength in UEs, but not attentive enough to follow formal strength commands in LEs - though is moving against gravity and some resistance bilaterally (at least [**2-18**]).

As no prior studies are provided for comparison, determination of progression of this abnormality cannot be made.
Brain MRI/MRA [**2171-12-29**]: Limited MRI and MRA of the brain due to motion.
NC Head CT [**2171-12-29**]: 1.
New hypodensity within the right occipital lobe, which has progressed compared to the prior study of [**2171-12-25**], likely representing evolving infarction in the territory of the right PCA.
Echocardiogram [**2171-12-31**]: 1.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
CT chest [**2172-1-2**]: 1) Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusion, associated with atelectasis.
She had right hemianopsia on initial exam and was also confused but followed simple commands.
Head CT day after admission showed a roughly 20cc bleed in the left occipital lobe, cortical, round appearing, with some interventricular extension, no hydrocephalus.
Her BP was initially controlled in the ICU with Nipride, then switched to nicardipine.
She was in the ICU for several days as her blood pressure was difficult to control.
Non-contrast head CT was obtained which now showed new infarction in the right occipital lobe.
MRI/MRA were negative for mass or aneurysm.
Transthoracic echo was also checked and did not show thrombi or vegetations.
TSH was checked and was normal.
RPR was non-reactive.
Dilantin level was checked and was therapeutic.
Chest X-ray on [**2171-12-29**] showed new retrocardiac opacity suggestive of atelectasis or new infiltrate or effusion.
Bilateral effusions were noted on CXR and chest CT.
The patient had no diarrhea and her abdominal exam was benign.
C. diff toxin was negative.
Breast exam was done and was negative.
Leukocytosis was attributed to recent infection.
HCT dropped from 35 to 29, but remained stable at around 30.
There was no localizing source of bleeding and decrease in HCT was attributed to dilutional effect.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Reticulocyte count 2.4%.
Iron studies (pre-transfusion) were checked and reveled low normal serum iron, elevated ferritin and slightly low TIBC.
Serum and urine protein electrophoresis was sent and the results were still pending at the time of discharge.
Patient's blood pressure was difficult to control.
Her mental exam after this episode was unchanged.
Stat head CT was obtained and showed on changes.
EKG was also unchanged.
Her systolic blood pressures have been in 130's on the day of discharge on irbesartan, labetalol, and hydralazine.
Original EKG showed Afib.
The patient was monitored on telemetry and would go in/out of afib.
She was rate controlled on labetalol with HR in 60's.
Head CT on [**2172-1-2**] showed no new hemorrhage or progression of existing hemorrhage.
Goal INR [**12-19**].
Her Coumadin level needs to be monitored and Coumadin dose adjusted.
Serum Osm 285.
Urine Osm 485.
Urine Na (on HCTZ) was 47.
The patient was started on standing Lasix prior to discharge and her electrolytes need to be carefully monitored.
Chest CT was done for evaluation of the nodule that was seen on chest X-ray.
This was not confirmed on chest CT and felt to be an artery or artifact.
Final chest CT results showed two 3 mm RUL nodules, paraesophageal lymph node, pulmonary effusions, and vertebral compression fracture.
Pulmonary nodules seen on chest CT will need to be followed up with repeat chest CT to evaluate for interval changes.
She will need daily weights and frequent reassessment of her volume status.
FEN: The swallowing evaluation was attempted, however, the patient was confused and not cooperative.
