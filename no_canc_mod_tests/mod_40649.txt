She had a head CT which was read as a posterior fossa bleed measuring 2.8 cm.
When she arrived here, she had a repeat head CT which appeared unchanged from the OSH.
Reflexes: intact  Toes downgoing bilaterally   Pertinent Results: Adm Labs: Hct 38.3 WBC-10.7 PLT262 INR 0.9 Na 136  Cl 101  BUN 21    Glu 123 K  4.5  CO2 23  Cr  0.6 CALCIUM-8.5 PHOSPHATE-4.2 MAGNESIUM-2.0  CT head: 1.
Recommend MRI of the head and neck with gadolinium for further evaluation of these processes.
However, a followup study would help to exclude a lesion which could be obscured by the hemorrhage.
Her MRI of the brain showed no mass or AVM, but there was mild ventricular enlargement and tonsillar herniation.
Her CT scan on [**4-14**] was stable and her CTA was negative.
Her EVD was leaking and was replaced on [**4-15**].
On [**4-17**] she had an angiogram which showed no aneurysm or AVM.
On [**4-23**] the patient's CT scan showed plump ventricles so the EVD was left in place.
The CT scan was stable on [**4-24**] and the drain remained clamped.
No vomiting was observed but the drain was opened at 15 and the symptoms resolved.
The patient's PTT was elevated to 117 on [**4-28**] but after stopping the sub-cutaneous heparin the PTT decreased to normal (28.5) pre-op.
During the procedure the surgery team palpated an abdominal mass so an abdominal CT was ordered.
The postop CT scan of head showed VP shunt in good position in R lateral ventricle and minute bilateral intraventricular bleeding acute on chronic in occipital horns bilaterally.
The CT abdomen showed:  -Large left retroperitoneal mass resulting in mass effect on the left kidney,  shifting it to the right, displacing the spleen superiorly, and extending via the  retroperitoneum into the pelvis where there are multiple areas of focal fat with  surrounding dystrophic calcification as well as more stippled calcification, and  these findings are highly suspicious for retroperitoneal liposarcoma vs. malignant  teratoma with transformation possibly into chondrosarcoma/liposarcoma.
F   Followup Instructions: You will need a CT scan of the brain in 8 weeks just prior to your follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]  You will also need to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**].
