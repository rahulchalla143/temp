[**2124-11-5**] CT Head: 1.
see details on the CT Facial bones.
[**2124-11-5**] CT Torso: 1.
[**2124-11-5**] CT Sinus/Mandible/Maxilla: 1.
[**2124-11-5**] CTA Head & Neck: 1.
Evolution of right cerebellar hemorrhage, which is slightly larger than on the prior study.
[**2124-11-6**] CT Head: 1.
[**2124-11-6**] MRA Neck: Inadequate study for assessment of vertebral artery dissection, with no post-contrast or time-of-flight MRA imaging obtained.
While the vessel would be better assessed by post-contrast imaging, time-of-flight technique through the left vertebral origin could also be obtained along with better quality axial T1 non-contrast fat sat sequences, if the patient continues to refuse intravenous gadolinium administration.
[**2124-11-8**] CT Head: 1.
Further evolution of the right occipital hemorrhagic contusion, unchanged in overall size.
Numerous facial fractures, as detailed on prior dedicated CT of facial bones.
Fat-suppressed images through the area would help for further assessment to exclude blood products from occlusion or dissection.
Brief Hospital Course: Imaging studies revealed the following injuries:  R cerebellar hemorrhage Lt pterygoid LeFort I fx Rt occipital fx b/l max sinus/orbital floor, Lt FNOE RUL asp, RML/LL contusion c7 corner fx, ant soft tissue swelling Rt [**9-10**] post rib fx R and L orbital fx comminuted nasal bone fx  The patient was admitted to the trauma surgery service and trauma SICU.
