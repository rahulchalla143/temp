At OSH, pt had a non-contrast head CT scan which showed a left sided SAH.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

CTA Head [**2150-6-4**] 1.
His wife took him to [**Hospital1 18**] where a [**Name (NI) 72787**] was performed and found a left side SAH.
Patient was then sent for a CTA where an ACOM aneurysm was found.
Patient became lethargic and less responsive, angiogram was performed to coil aneurysm and an EVD was placed to relieve ICP.
Post angiogram check it was noted that patient was moving his L>R.
On [**5-8**], his exam improved, he was a&ox3, full strength on L and antigravity with both upper and lower extremities on the R side.
His SBP will be pushed to 180 and we will repeat angio on [**5-14**].
Overnight he also had a Tmax of 101.9, he was pancultured and a CXR was ordered.
CSF samples have been negative to this date.
Over the weekend of [**5-16**] and [**5-17**], the patient's blood pressure was liberalized by the SICu team to less than 140.
A stat head CT/CTA was performed , which showed persistent but not new vasospasm.
On [**5-20**], patient's blood pressure was liberalized to 140-160.
CTA on [**5-19**] showed vasospasm and hypertonic saline is being weaned to off.
MRI of the lumbar spine was ordered due to patient's complaint of back pain.
Blood pressure parameters continue to be 140-160.
We continue to keep his pressures between 140-160.
He also spiked fevers 103 and was pancultured.
Lenis showed a R dvt from the proximal SFV.
CTA of chest showed a R subsegmental PE.
His neurological exam improved and his blood pressure remained well controlled;  therefore he was transferred out of the ICU to the floor on [**2150-5-30**].
Patient's neurologic exam continued to improved, RLE [**5-4**] in IPs and RUE 5-/5.
CTA was done on [**6-4**] which was stable and patient was taken to angiogram for coiling of his aneurysm.
His angiogram and coiling was completed without difficulty and he was placed on a heparin gtt overnight which was stopped on the morning of [**6-5**].
?You will need an MRI of the Brain with and without contrast in 6 months.
