CPK as measured at the outside hospital, first set was 66 with MB index of 7.5 and troponin of 2.0.
After arrival to [**Hospital1 69**] status post catheterization CK was 97.
The patient's ECG showed #1 upon presentation to outside hospital emergency department revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 90.
There were [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in leads 2, 3 and aVF with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in leads 1, aVL.

EKG #3 status post cardiac catheterization and stenting at [**Hospital1 69**] revealed normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per minute with normal axis and PR prolongation with PR interval of 220 msec.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred directly to the cardiac catheterization lab at [**Hospital1 188**].
His catheterization on [**2128-12-14**], revealed the following hemodynamics.
Cardiac output by Fick equation was 3.86 with cardiac index of 1.78.
Pulmonary wedge pressure had a mean of 26.
Right atrial pressure was 17.
Aortic systolic pressure was 105, diastolic pressure 71.
PA pressure was 40/25 with a mean pressure of 32.
Right ventricular pressure was 47/25.
Systolic vascular resistance was measured at 1333 with pulmonary vascular resistance of 123.
Catheterization of the patient's coronary arteries revealed 90% discrete stenosis in the proximal RCA, tubular mid-RCA stenosis of 70% with normal acute marginal and normal distal RCA.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
At the end of cardiac catheterization the patient was noted to have some periorbital swelling and questionable tongue swelling.
There was a concern for CNS bleeding as the patient was status post lytic therapy at the outside hospital with altered mental status status post cardiac catheterization.
An emergency head CT was performed which showed no intracranial bleeding.
