Head CT was negative.
Her EKG showed NSR in the 90s with no ST segment changes, however her Trop was 1.8.
Her SBP increased to the 240's with her LVEDP in the 30's even when given TNG 200 mcg/min IVD, furosemide 20 mg IV, 6 mg total of morphine, midazolam IV, labetalol IV bolus, nitroprusside IV infusion, and amlodipine 10 mg po.
Her SBP eventually fell to the 150s.

[**12-26**] C Cath COMMENTS: 1.
Limited resting hemodyanmics demonstrated severe systemic systolic arterial hypertension with a SBP >200mm Hg.
[**12-27**] C Cath COMMENTS: 1.
Selective coronary angiography showed 2-vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 175/75 mmHg.
Interim angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and a 40% residual stenosis.
[**12-27**] Echo There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-12-4**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Diastolic function cannot be determined on the current study.
Her SBP increased to the 240's with her LVEDP in the 30's even when given TNG 200 mcg/min IVD, furosemide 20 mg IV, 6 mg total of morphine, midazolam IV, labetalol IV bolus, nitroprusside IV infusion, and amlodipine 10 mg po.
Her SBP eventually fell to the 150s when she was transferred to the CCU on a nitrogylcerin and nitroprusside drip.
Her CP resolved as her anxiety and agitation decreased.
Her SBP rose to the 200's during the procedure again and she was started on a nitro gtt which was weaned off overnight as her blood pressue was better controlled with oral medications.
Problem Based Hospital Course:  # s/p NSTEMI:  The patient had no prior history of CAD, but had positive Cardiac enzymes in the setting of hypertensive emergency.
# Hypertensive Emergency:  Blood pressues controlled in the 130s-140s on discharge.
Resolved on discharge with Cr 1.5.
Note:  Patient was dischaged without presciptions for blood pressure medications.
