She was initially found to have a blood pressure of 195/112, however after intubation and starting propofol she dropped as low as 114 systolic.
She was briefly started on neostigmine to then elevate her blood pressure, however this was stopped on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
At [**Hospital 26580**] Hospital she had a head CT which showed a 2.5x6cm L basal ganglia hemorrhage, with ~8mm midline shift.
Neurologic - performed ~30 minutes after patient received vecuronium for agitation.
-Motor/Sensory: Flaccid, no response to painful stimuli.

CT [**11-2**]: IMPRESSION:  1.
Increased paranasal sinus opacification, which be intubation-related.
CT [**11-4**]: Left basal ganglia hemorrhage with extension into the left lateral ventricle has slightly decreased in size.
CXR [**11-3**] SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST  REASON FOR EXAM: Intubated patient in the SICU.
Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
CXR [**2197-11-4**]: Endotracheal tube is low in position, only 1.5 cm proximal to the carina.
CXR [**11-6**] SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm above the carina.
CXR [**11-7**]  Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
CXR [**11-13**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2196-11-15**], there is ill-defined opacification in the right apical region that cannot all be explained by bony structures.
The patient should have a follow up MRI with contrast in [**11-18**] months after discharge to ensure that there is not an underlying lesion which caused the initial hemorrhage.
Neurosurgery requested a head CT in one month to assess progression of bleeding and hydrocephalus.
Her repeat chest x ray did not show appearance of new opacity.
It was watery and her Cl Diff toxin assays were negative ( 3 times).
decision was made to repeat stool toxin studies and stool culture which is still pending.
She was started on Flagyl 500 tid on [**11-14**] for a duration of 1 week depending upon clinical response.
CVS Over the course of her stay her blood pressure was well controlled other than few episodes of HTN which later resolved, and she did not require any antihypertensive agents.
She is on Flagyl PO for presumptive treatment of Cl Diff,(stool negative times 3),started on [**11-14**], and is planned for 1 week course, however this may be modified depending upon clinical response.
Urine metanephrine pending at DC, done as a work up for episodic HTN given her lack of prior history of hypertension.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital of [**Location (un) **] & Islands - [**Location (un) 6251**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left basal ganglia hemorrhage, likely hypertensive Pneumonia, treated   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness:Lethargic but arousable Activity Status: Out of bed to chair, PT as tolerated   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after you were found collapsed at your desk at work.
An image of your head was obtained and you wre found to have a bleed on the left side, deep in your brain tissue.
You are also requested to return in 1 month with a head CT to ensure there is not worsening of the pressure in your brain.
