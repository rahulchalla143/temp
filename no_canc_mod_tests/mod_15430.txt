HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of panic attacks who came to the hospital on [**2159-7-9**], for a preoperative arteriogram for a scheduled left femoral popliteal bypass.
The patient was taken to the Emergency Department where he was noted to be diaphoretic, tachypneic and tachycardic with a heart rate of 105, a respiratory rate of 28 and a temperature of 101.5 degrees.
Subsequently, the patient's blood pressure was 178/94 with a heart rate of 130, a respiratory rate of 32 and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.
The patient's heart rate increased to 150's and his respiratory rate increased to 36.
The patient was taken for a CT arteriogram of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolus which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
The CT did show evidence of tracheomalacia.
The patient's blood pressure rose of a value of 225/110.
The patient also received four liters of normal saline with a urine output of 100 cc.
The patient continued to be tachypneic and hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 150.
He was therefore put on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation at a pressure support of 20 and a PEEP of 8.
The patient's arterial blood gas on these settings was 7.39, 47 and 179.
The patient continued to be febrile with a temperature of 102.6, a heart rate of 130, a blood pressure of 180/106 and a respiratory rate of 36 to 40.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient's temperature was 102.6 degrees, his heart rate was 130, blood pressure 184/106, respiratory rate 36 and oxygen saturation was 99% on assist control ventilation.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, the pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
The lung examination revealed clear lungs bilaterally.
The chest examination revealed tachycardia, regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdominal examination revealed a soft distended belly with positive bowel sounds.
The extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Cool extremities bilaterally with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse on the right and a dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse on the left.
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray revealed a rib fracture of the fourth rib of indeterminate age and presence of consolidation or effusion at the left base that could not be excluded.
Chest CT angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  Revealed white blood count of 8.6, hematocrit 44.9, platelet count 305,000 with a differential as follows:  87% neutrophils, 5% bands, 5% leukocytes, 1% monocytes, 2% eosinophils.
The PT was 13.9, INR 1.3, PTT 24.2.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.4, chloride 93, bicarb 30, BUN 11, creatinine 1.0, glucose 157, anion gap 16.
Urinalysis revealed pH 7.0, specific gravity of 1.010, negative nitrite, negative leukocyte esterase, negative ketones, negative glucose, no red blood cells and no white blood cells.
Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 46, paO2 of 74.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were taken at this time.
In addition, a labetalol drip was started on [**7-13**] as it was determined that the patient's labile blood pressure was due partly to withdrawal symptoms and partly to underlying hypertension.
Phenobarbital levels on [**7-14**] were 19.7, below the toxic range.
The patient was persistently febrile since admission with temperatures of 102.6 to 101.8.
On [**7-11**] culs from [**7-9**] and [**7-10**] came back positive for Gram negative rods growing in the anaerobic bottle.
This study was nonconclusive so a HIDA scan was ordered which showed no abnormalities of the gallbladder or biliary tree.
A follow-up abdominal CT showed an inflamed appendix with a fluid collection consistent with perforated appendicitis.
A CT of the abdomen showed a fluid collection in the right lower quadrant measuring 3 cm x 2.8 cm inferior to the cecum in addition to a possible second fluid collection of 1 cm adjacent to the terminal ileum, an 8 mm tubular structure that could represent an inflamed appendix was noted on reconstructed images.
Therefore, an abdominal CT was repeated on [**7-15**] in order to evaluate for possible abscess around the appendix which could be drained surgically.
In addition, sinus CT was obtained to rule out other sources of fevers.
At this time the blood cultures came back positive for Clostridium non perfringens, non septicum in one bottle and bacterial species in the other bottle.
Respiratory:  Initially the patient was hypoxic with a CT angiogram on admission which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus but did show severe tracheomalacia of unclear etiology.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  The patient was started on tube feeds on [**7-12**] with thiamine, folate, insulin, heparin and ranitidine in the tube feeds.
Hypertension:  The patient continued to have labile blood pressure during his MICU stay with blood pressures rising to 200/110 usually late at night and in the early morning.
The patient was initially treated with Valium as it was thought that the hypertension was secondary to withdrawal but then the patient was switched over to a labetalol drip for blood pressure control as it was thought that his hypertension was more long-standing in origin.
The patient had an echocardiogram on admission which was limited due to the patient's size but showed a normal sized left ventricle with normal systolic function.
The patient had had a preoperative cardiac Persantine ETT and cardiac perfusion scan.
In addition, the cardiac perfusion scan showed an enlarged left ventricle with a calcified left ventricular end diastolic volume of 285 mL with a moderate defect of 8, inferior wall that was a fixed defect, a calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 49%.
