Admission Date:  [**2139-7-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-7-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-10-25**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2139-7-5**], for shortness of breath and with a room air oxygen saturation of 72%.
He improved clinically with diuresis, and an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 40%, anterior septal akinesis, apical akinesis, anterior hypokinesis, and akinesis.
On this admission in the Emergency Department, he arrived with an oxygen saturation of 72%, 92-96% on non-rebreather.
An ABG done at that time showed a pH of 7.39, 30, 94 on non-rebreather.
He was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was diuresed with intravenous Lasix, and urine output to that was over a liter.
He became stable at 95% on 4 L with room air oxygen saturations of 88-92%, and the patient himself said that he felt much less short of breath.
His ejection fraction in [**2139-3-12**] was as stated prior.
Vital signs:  Temperature 97.5?????
?, pulse 73-93, blood pressure 112-157/61-78, 97% on 4 L, oxygen saturation 88-92% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient came in with a white count of 9.2, which subsequently fell to 5.2, hematocrit was 26.7 on admission, platelet count 164,000; INR 1.3, PTT 30; electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 136, potassium 4.7, chloride 109, bicarb 15, BUN 58, creatinine 3.1, glucose 207, baseline creatinine 2.3-3.3.
The patient had a chest x-ray which showed small bilateral effusions, left greater than right, left lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis.
Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 75, normal axis, ST elevations 1.0-1.5 mm in V1-V3 which were old, T-wave inversions I, AVL, V5 and V6 which is new, Q in V1 and V2, consistent with electrocardiogram from [**2139-3-23**].
His chest x-ray is consistent with left lower lobe process, but the rapid development in resolution of his hypoxemia, as well as his chest x-ray findings, are most consistent with acute pulmonary edema.
The patient continued with Lopressor 25 t.i.d., and I&Os were monitored, and a follow-up chest x-ray showed improvement in bilateral effusion.
Cardiology:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction, and it was noted that he had an [**Month (only) 547**] MIBI which showed severe perfusion defect in the apex, moderate perfusion defect in the inferior wall, moderate perfusion defect in the septum, all partially reversible, with an ejection fraction of 47%, and septal hypokinesis.
Cardiac catheterization was considered at that time but was deferred because of worsening renal function.
On this admission, Cardiology was reconsulted, and given that the patient had pulmonary edema, it was felt that it would be prudent to proceed with cardiac catheterization at the soonest possible time, as long as the patient's renal function was stabilized.
for blood pressure control, as well as his Pravachol 40 q.d.
After discussion with the patient and his attending, as well as Cardiology, it was decided that the patient could come back for an elective catheterization within the next two weeks after discharge.
He will likely need admission prior to catheterization for intravenous hydration, given his renal function.
Renal function:  The patient, on the hospital floor, developed worsening creatinine to a peak creatinine of 4.0 on the 29th; however, his urine output continued to be adequate, and he continued to have actually high urine output even after Lasix was discontinued.
Cyclosporin toxicity was considered, and the trough was checked which was normal at 163.
Lasix was held, and the creatinine actually improved to a creatinine of 2.9 at the time of discharge.
Because of his high urine output, which was consistent with an ATN-like picture, the patient was instructed to maintain p.o.
Infectious disease:  The patient had a temperature to 101.4??????
Blood cultures, urine cultures were negative.
Chest x-ray however showed a retrocardiac opacity which remained even after diuresis; however, the patient was afebrile on the floor.
He was treated however with Levaquin which was renally dosed at 250 q.d., and the patient was continued for a full 14-day course of Levaquin; however, he had no elevation in white count and had no fevers on the Medical floor at all.
Hematology:  The patient had anemia with a hematocrit of 29 post-diuresis.
Since Cyclosporin can cause hemolytic anemia, haptoglobin was checked which was 136, not decreased, and thus this was deemed very unlikely.
congestive heart failure symptoms, Lopressor 50 b.i.d., ProAmatine 10 t.i.d., Niferex 150 q.d., NPH 32 and 9 as previously, regular Insulin sliding scale, Levaquin 250 p.o.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable to go home with return for cardiac catheterization within two weeks.
