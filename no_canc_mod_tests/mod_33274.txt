Rigid bronchoscopy with Dumon black bronchoscope.
infiltrates so he was started on vanc and ceftaz for hospital acquired pna.
At the OSH, a CT chest showed increase in the L pleural effusion, collapse of the L lung with obstruction of the L main stem bronchus, questionable endobronchial lesion vs mucous plug.
He was hemodialized 2.5L and a thoracentesis was performed removing 1L of pleural fluid which was negative for microorganisms.
A bronchoscopy was performed showing a L main stem mucous plug, abnormal endobronchial mucosa with external compression that was so severe they were unable to safely advance the bronchoscope.
A BAL was performed showing oropharyngial flora and biopsies of the abnormal mucosa were sent to pathology.
LUE doppler was again repeated due to persistent LUE edema which was negative.
On bronchoscopy there was no endobronchial lesion seen however he did have extrinsic compression of LLL segments.
His blood pressure cuff and Aline were correlating.

Complete atelectasis of the left lung with a low-density material within the left main bronchus that may represent secretions although correlation with bronchoscopy is recommended.
CXR [**2179-8-13**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, one chest tube has been inserted into each pleural space.
ECHO [**2179-8-17**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
CXR [**2179-8-20**]: The position of the multiple chest tubes and lines is essentially unchanged since the prior chest x-ray.
Hospital Course: Acute on chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with EF 5-10%, exacerbation likely [**2-15**] combination of volume overload (up 30kg from dry weight) and positive pressure ventillation for rigid bronchoscopy.
In order to achieve this the patient was kept on pressors to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 70.
He required increased amount of pressors to maintain his blood pressure.
The patient was mentating clearly until his systolic blood pressures fell below 50.
His blood pressure continued to fall despite maximal pressor therapy with all the medications listed above.
