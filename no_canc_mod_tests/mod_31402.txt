His initial VSs were 98.1, 84, 96/53, 80, 94%.
A CXR demonstrated a questionable new opacity at the right base.
A U/A was suggestive of UTI, and he was covered broadly for both UTI and PNA with vancomycin, ceftazadime and levofloxacin.
Among the pt's outside records were lab reports indicating that his Cr was 2.1 on [**12-9**] and had risen to 4.2 on [**12-11**].

MICROBIOLOGY: C diff toxin +  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 87 yo man with recent stroke with persistent near-hemiplegia and PEG placement, DM2, CKD presents from NH with delirium, acute renal failure, ?
His x-ray was read as a possible right lower lobe pneumonia, and then evolved with perihilar opacities.
By the 12th (day [**2-4**]) his x-ray was no longer showing a clear opacity, but he remained ventilator dependent with copious oral and pulmonary secretions.
He was titrated down to FiO2 of 0.40, pressure support of 10 and PEEP of 5 by the 14th, and has been on these settings since then.
His BUN was remarkably high (baseline at last d/c was 20), though he had no pericardial rub on exam.
A CT head was negative for new processes although it did show an old pontine infarct.
A clear etiology was not identified since his infection and hypernatremia were both treated in the first days of his admission; his mental status appeared to clear somewhat although it was difficult to tell (particularly in the setting of requiring mechanical ventilation) what his baseline was and whether he had returned to it.
We have been attempting to avoid sedation in order to try to work further towards weaning from the vent.
# Acute renal failure: Mr [**Last Name (Titles) 95405**] creatinine was quite elevated from baseline on arrival at 4.3, with a BUN of 120; we hydrated him aggressively and saw a progressive improvement in his creatinine over the next several days.
We held his lisinopril and other antihypertensives, and dosed medicines renally as appropriate.
His creatinine rose again in the last three days of admission (to 2.4 on [**12-26**]) in the setting of gentle efforts at diuresis, with the hope of getting his pulmonary and peripheral edema to resolve.
He received a unit of packed red blood cells on [**12-14**] for a hematocrit of 21.4 which was dropping in the setting of aggressive hydration (a source of bleeding was not identified then or in retrospect).
He also received a unit of packed red blood cells on [**12-25**] for a hematocrit of 21.9, with the expectation that this would continue to drop, he would be leaving the ICU soon, and evaluation of his post-transfusion stability would be helpful before transfer.
Otherwise his hematocrit transfusion criteria could be <21.
Tube feeds; we changed this during the last two days of his admission to reduce his total fluid volume, and on discharge he was on Replete w/fiber, full strength; with a goal rate of 65 ml/hr.
Medications on Admission: Aranesp Amlodipine 10 daily Atorvastatin 40 daily Clopidogrel 75 daily Vitamin D 1000 daily Ferrous sulfate 325 daily Glipizide 10 daily Lisinopril 7.5 mg daily Metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] Acetaminophen prn Omeprazole 20 [**Hospital1 **] Senna 2 tabs [**Hospital1 **] Insulin .

Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV DAILY:PRN Peripheral IV - Inspect site every shift 17.
Aranesp (Polysorbate) 40 mcg/0.4 mL Syringe [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) injection Injection every other week.
* Weaning from vent as tolerated * Treatment of C. diff infection; day 1 of 14 day course of metronidazole is [**12-26**] * Ongoing evaluation of mental status; not clear what new baseline will be at this point.
