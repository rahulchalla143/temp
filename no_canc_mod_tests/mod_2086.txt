An adherent clot was noted initially, but removed with washing, and no high-risk stigmata were noted.
The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.
A pre-procedure timeout and huddle was performed per [**Hospital1 18**] protocol.
5 French glide Cobra catheter was used to catheterize the superior mesenteric artery and an arteriogram was performed and recorded digitally.
Using a combination of Transcend microwire and microcatheter, the left gastric artery was cannulated more distally, and diagnostic angiograms were performed.
A slurry of Gelfoam following coil embolization was also performed.
The catheter and the sheath were removed, and firm pressure held at the right groin until complete hemostasis was achieved.
Celiac arteriogram demonstrating typical branching pattern with a gastrohepatic trunk and tortuous left gastric artery.
Left gastric arteriogram demonstrating no active extravasation or lesion.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**2142-5-26**]: CT abdomen/pelvis  IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2142-5-28**]: CT abd/pelvis  IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2142-5-31**]: US liver  Difficult study due to multiple dressings overlying the anterior abdomen in the region of interest.
At OSH she had 500cc of bloody emesis and HCT 37 to 29 on arrival to our ED.
Patient remained normotensive and her repeat HCTs were 27.4 and 27.5.
She remained stable after this with no further evidence of bleeding and her hematocrit remained stable.
On HD #3, a repeat EGD was done which showed the same jejunal ulcers, non-bleeding.
An abdominal/pelvic CT scan did reveal lobulated hypoattenuating non-enhancing abnormality within the lateral segment of the left liver with associated moderate left greater than right intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and proximal common duct dilation to 1 cm.
This was sent for gram stain and culture which was negative for any growth.
A follow-up CT scan was done to evaulate the hepatic fluid collection after the drainage catheter had been removed.
At the time of the study the pt's WBC count was decreasing and she remained afebrile.
This was sent for gram stain and culture which was negative for any growth.
Her drain output initially put out roughly 200cc per day of bilious drainage.
Pt remained hemodynamically stable with a rising hematocrit, normal white blood cell count and she remianed afebrile.
On [**2142-5-31**] an US of the liver was obtained at the request of the hepatobiliary surgical team which showed a decrease in size of the hepatic fluid collection and the pigtail catheter well placed in the center of the collection.
Pt was discharged with pigtail catheter in place with instructions to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], her PCP as well as her bariatric surgeons from [**Hospital1 **].
-Nutrition labs sent which were normal as well.
