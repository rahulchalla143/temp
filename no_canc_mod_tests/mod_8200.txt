Compared to the previous tracing of [**2175-9-19**] the  ventricular premature beat is new and the ventricular rate is slightly faster.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2176-1-11**] at 8:46:47 AM Conclusions The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
ECG Study Date of [**2176-1-11**]  4:15:34 PM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-1-10**] there is no significant change.
ECG Study Date of [**2176-1-12**]  12:50:16 PM Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-1-11**] there is no significant change.
Radiology Report  CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2176-1-10**] 8:28 PM Final Report COMPARISON: [**2175-9-19**].
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2176-1-12**] 9:07 AM Final Report REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of Swan-Ganz position.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2176-1-11**].
Pre-op EKG-Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2175-9-19**] the  ventricular premature beat is new and the ventricular rate is slightly faster.
[**2176-1-11**] TTE ECHO-that showed severe global hypokinesis with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
Taken to OR and underwent Ultrasound-guided access for vascular imaging,aortic catheterization with abdominal aortogram and pelvic runoff, right common iliac artery stent, right external iliac artery stent, right to left femoral to femoral bypass,removal of axillary to femoral bypass graft.
Cultures sent in OR.
Patient c/o chest pressure with a 9 beat run for V-tach, EKG done and cardiac enzymes sent.
Cultures from [**2176-1-11**] came back negative.
Cultures from [**1-13**] remain pending.
All cultures came back preliminary negative.
