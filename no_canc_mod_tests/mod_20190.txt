In the Emergency Room, at the outside hospital, chest x-ray showed acute infiltrate superimposed on chronic right middle lobe infiltrate.
He had a repeat CAT scan on admission at [**Hospital3 **] with an increase in size of mass.
The patient was initially treated with Levaquin for community-acquired pneumonia as well as steroids for a COPD exacerbation; however, he grew MRSA in his sputum culture on [**2151-4-12**].
He was treated with 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**2151-4-10**] for a hematocrit of 26.6 down from 36 on [**2151-4-6**].
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of his hypoxia and questionable lung mass.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 100.3, pulse 73, blood pressure 180/60, respirations 21, 93% on a 50% face mask.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 8.1, hematocrit 33.8, platelets 224,000, MCV 87.
INR 1.6.
Chest x-ray showed a right middle lobe and right lower lobe opacity.
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, pulmonary artery pressure of 20 mmHg, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild 1+ aortic regurgitation, and moderate aortic stenosis with mild dilation of the ascending aorta.
The patient also had a CAT scan to follow-up on history of lung mass and asbestos exposure.
CAT scan showed no pleural mass but loculated fluid in the minor fissure that is somewhat mass-like in appearance.
A follow-up CAT scan in three months is recommended.
The patient's hypoxia continued to improve and on the day of transfer to the floor, he was on [**4-27**] liters of nasal cannula with saturations greater than 93%.
The patient remained afebrile during this admission and his white count was within normal limits as well.
His sputum cultures were repeatedly contaminated and his blood cultures are no growth to date.
QUESTIONABLE RIGHT LOWER LOBE MASS:  There was no mass seen on chest CT here, however, there was lymphadenopathy that could be consistent with infectious reaction.
It was thought that a calcium channel blocker would be a better choice in this patient with COPD as opposed to metoprolol.
The patient's echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55% with no marked left atrial dilation.
Please see above for more details on echocardiogram report.
HYPERTENSION:  The patient's blood pressure was well controlled during this admission.
The patient's hematocrit was stable during his ICU course requiring no transfusions.
Iron studies showed an anemia of chronic disease picture, however, it is hard to interpret in the setting of recent transfusions.
The patient will be transferred to the floor on [**2151-4-18**] to continue his evaluation and treatment.
