ECHO Study Date of [**2191-2-21**] The left and right atrium are moderately dilated.
The remaining segments contract well [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened and supporting apparatus is fibrotic/calcified, but no mitral stenosis is suggested.
Echocardiogram revealed no significant akinesis or dyskinesis, however, significant MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12681**], and inferiolateral hypokinesis.
MRI brain did not identify significant evidence of diffuse anoxic brain injury, however EEG revealed spike and slow wave suggesting anoxic encephalopathy and seizure activity.
