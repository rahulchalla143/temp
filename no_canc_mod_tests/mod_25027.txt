History of Present Illness: This is a 52-year-old woman with a history of IDDM Type II complicated by nephropathy and neuropathy, CHF with LVEF of 30%, HTN, HLD, CAD s/p CABG x2 complicated by sternal wound abscess (MSSA/MRSA), CKD, HIT and COPD recently discharged from [**Hospital 87678**] on [**2169-6-15**] presenting with subdural hematoma, acute renal failure and altered mental status.
CT chest showed possible phlegmon of lower portion of chest surgery wound but seen by CT surgery who did not feel there was concern for sternal wound infection.
Her course was also complicated by ARF [**3-16**] supratherapetic Vancomycin levels, continued leukocytosis (WBC 16), LUE superficla clot, lymphadenopathy noted on abdominal CT of uncertain significance, polyarticular pain for which she was seen by rheumatology (thought to have gout though crystals not found on knee arthrocentesis).
On eval at OSH, CT head showed small tentorial SDH and so was transferred here for neurosurgery evaluation.
Plan to admit to medicine for multiple medical problems and further workup of AMS and plan for rescan with NCHCT in 24hrs."

CT head [**2169-6-26**]: IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of a small left subdural hematoma, tracking along the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli.
Calcifications in the bilateral cavernous, carotid and vertebral arteries.
CT head [**2169-6-27**]: IMPRESSION:  No significant change from prior study.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-1-8**], global and regional left ventricular systolic function is now improved.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 52-year-old woman with a history of DM2 c/b nephropathy and neuropathy, CHF with LVEF of 30%, CAD s/p CABG x2, CKD, recent sinus infection c/b endopthalmitis, admitted for subdural hematoma, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, altered mental status, in the setting of supratherapeutic gabapentin levels, s/p hypertonic saline treatment with good response.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:  Patient's creatinine was 2.2 on discharge from Mass Eye & Ear and presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with a creatinine of 6.0.
Urine sediment showed muddy brown casts suggesting ATN.
Creatinine slowly improved to 2.1 at discharge.
# GABAPENTIN TOXICITY: patient's gabapentin level was 41 on this admission, which was likely related to her acute on chronic kidney disease.
# CHF: Systolic CHF with LVEF of 30%, no evidence of acute exacerbation on admission.
Her echo showed no significant changes from prior.
Metoprolol was initially held given low BP but soon resumed after BP normalized.
# LYMPHADENOPATHY:  Per d/c summary from Mass Eye & Ear, she had CT abdomen that showed lymphadenopathy.
Outpatient sleep study is recommended.
Follow up lymphadenopathy on CT abdomen 2.
Sleep study is recommended given pulmonary hypertension 4.
Follow up final blood culture 5.
