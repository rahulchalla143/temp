Admission Date:  [**2164-9-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-10-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2099-3-6**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-10**] for cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's physical exam at the time of admission revealed vital signs with heart rate 87, blood pressure 100/60, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 100% on 2 liters nasal prongs.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ on the right, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses on the left.
LABORATORY ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's laboratory data at the time of admission was white blood cell count 9.6, hematocrit 29.2, platelets 93,000.
Sodium 137, potassium of 4.3, chloride 102, bicarbonate 25, BUN 19, creatinine 1.3, glucose 158.
PT 13.9, PTT 38.3, INR 1.3.
Creatine phosphokinases 513, with MB of 98, troponin greater than 50.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in II, III, and F; normal sinus rhythm at 80, ST depressions in V1 and V2.
In summary, the catheterization showed a proximal 90% left anterior descending artery lesion, 60% proximal left circumflex lesion, and a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery which received angioplasty and stent.
An electrocardiogram was done, and he was found to have ST elevations.
Following this episode of pain, discussion revolved around whether or not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump; however, the fact that the pain had resolved, balloon pump was delayed and the patient was brought that morning to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times four.
His mean arterial pressure was 84.
His PAD was 19.
Of note, on exploration of the chest cavity, the patient was noted to have suffered a large right ventricular infarct prior to his surgery.
In addition, his chest tubes were removed on postoperative day two.
On postoperative day nine, the patient was again noted to have a low blood pressure with decreasing urine output and an increasing creatinine.
An echocardiogram was obtained.
At that time the echocardiogram showed that the left ventricular size and systolic function were normal, that the right ventricle was dilated and hypokinetic, with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and trace mitral regurgitation.
At the time of transfer the patient's physical examination was as follows:  Vital signs were temperature of 98.3, heart rate 89, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 112/76, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 92% on 2 liters nasal prongs.
General examination revealed comfortable, in no acute distress.
Breath sounds with diffuse wheezes with scattered rhonchi.
Heart sounds revealed a regular rate and rhythm, S1/S2.
Weight preoperatively was 102.8 kg; at discharge was 108 kg.
Laboratory data on [**10-2**] revealed a white blood cell count 9.7, hematocrit 31, platelets 270.
Sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 102, bicarbonate 27, BUN 31, creatinine 1.2, glucose 183.
Digoxin level was 1.1.
