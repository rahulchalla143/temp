Portable CXR noted some pulmonary congestion.
Laboratory studies showed a WBC 8.3, HCT 42.9%, PLT 211.
Potassium 3.8 and creatinine 1.0.
INR 1.0.
A urinalysis was negative.
Hypothermia protocol was initiated and he was given 2L chilled normal saline and reached a core temperature of 32.6 degrees Celsius.
[**Location (un) 86**] [**Location (un) 7622**] transported the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] at 9:05 AM.

Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 59M with a PMH significant for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (cardiac MRI showing dilated LV with mild-to-moderate global systolic dysfunction, EF 42%, mild MR in [**2165**]), HLD, known LBBB who is status-post sudden cardiac arrest (with undetermined rhythm) who had ROSC after shocks and CPR who is now intubated, sedated, paralyzed and on a hypothermia protocol, and is now hemodynamically stable.
# STATUS-POST SUDDEN CARDIAC (VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION) ARREST - The patient presented with a witnessed sudden cardiac arrest event the morning of admission - rhythm strip consistent with ventricular fibrillation (torsades de Pointes appearance).
He has no known coronary disease given his clean coronaries (per report) on cardiac catheterization in [**2165**].
A hypothermia protocol was initiated and the patient was transported via [**Last Name (un) **]-flight to [**Hospital1 18**].
His CTA chest was negative for pulmonary embolus and his heparin gtt was discontinued.
A 2D-Echo showed no evidence of focal wall motion abnormality and his LVEF was stable as compared to prior.
He required cardiac MR imaging on [**1-26**] that showed no change from his previous cardiac MR, with EF 45%, no late gadolinium enhancement and a small anteroseptal wall motion abnormality that wasn't specific to one particular coronary distribution and was likely the result of the arrest.
An ICD was placed on [**1-27**].
He will have to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-23**] for an EP study and cardiac cath on [**2-24**] to further identify any etiology for his vfib arrest.
# NON-ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY - The patient had a 2D-Echo which showed an LVEF of 30% by 2D-Echo in [**12/2163**] that was performed after an office EKG was noted to be abnormal (Q-waves in the inferior leads).
A repeat 2D-Echo in [**5-/2165**] revealed a LVEF of 20% with global hypokinesis.
Cardiac catheterization was performed in [**5-/2165**] revealing normal coronary arteries and low normal right and left sided filling pressures.
A cardiac MRI was performed [**7-/2165**], showing an effective forward LVEF of 39% without evidence of scarring or infarction.
The right ventricular ejection fraction was normal.
This admission, his repeat 2D-Echo following his cardiac arrest showed an LVEF of 45%, with similar findings compared to his prior study.
His lipid panel was overall reassuring and ultimately atorvastatin was discontinued as it was felt that his arrest was likely related to arrhythmia rather than ACS/atherosclerosis.
Plan for EP study and cath on [**2-24**].
Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy 2.
You underwent an extensive imaging and laboratory work-up to determine the cause of your cardiac arrest which to date did not show any particular etiology.
You will need to return for an electrophysiology study and cardiac catheterization at the end of the month to do further testing.
You will also have an EP study and Cardiac Catheterization on [**2-24**] that you will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
