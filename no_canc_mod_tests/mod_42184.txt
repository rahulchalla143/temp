On [**7-29**], the patient began to experience sweats, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting and was noted to be mildly jaundiced.
She was sent to the [**Hospital6 **] Emergency Department from detoxification, afebrile and with a blood pressure of 100/60 and respiratory rate of 50s.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was done which showed a normal liver, normal bile ducts and no ascites.
She was initially treated with Vitamin K, methadone and Phenergan, and on [**8-8**] was begun on lamivudine for hepatitis B treatment after her hepatitis panel came back positive for a hepatitis B surface antigen and negative hepatitis B surface antibody.
The patient's INR rose to 3.3 and she was transfused with two units of fresh frozen plasma during the course of her admission.
The patient's liver work-up at [**Hospital6 **] included [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody, iron studies and ceruloplasmin, all of which were negative.
Her INR at discharge was 3.55.
Her LFTs on admission were as follows:  ALT 382, AST 376, alkaline phosphatase 165, T bilirubin 31, direct bilirubin 15.7.
Her ammonia was 105 and her INR was 5.
The patient had a head CT and toxicology screen, both of which were negative.
She was transferred back to [**Hospital6 **] on [**8-12**] with the following vital signs:  She was afebrile with a pulse of 86.
Respiratory rate of 20.
Blood pressure 147/81.
When she arrived here, her physical examination was as follows:  Her vitals were as follows:  Temperature 97.4.
Pulse 82.
Respiratory rate 17.
Blood pressure 108/49, saturating 100% on room air.
Her head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam was significant for the following:  Her sclera were icteric bilaterally.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her deep tendon reflexes were [**2-17**]+.
Her skin exam was significant for marked jaundice, but there were no rashes and no spider angiomata that was appreciated.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Significant for a INR of 8.7.
Her PTT was 66 and her PT was 35.4.
Her Chem-7 was notable for a potassium of 5.9.
Her CBC was within normal limits.
Her calcium, magnesium and phosphorus were all within normal limits.
Her liver function tests were as follows:  ALT 254, AST 204, alkaline phosphatase 124, LDH 458, albumin 2.6, total bilirubin 30.3, direct bilirubin 14.0 and ammonia 80.
For her liver failure, the patient did not meet the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3728**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1688**] criteria for liver transplantation.
At that point, the decision was made to consult Ophthalmology for the possibility of Kayser-Fleischer rings and to check a serum and urine copper.
The patient's serum copper came back within normal limits and Ophthalmology did find Kayser-Fleischer by direct ophthalmoscope on her exam and at the time of this dictation, the urine copper was still pending.
The Hematology Service was consulted on [**8-23**] to address the issue of elevated prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time in this patient.
The Hematology consults felt that the patient's thrombocytopenia might be secondary to low thrombopoietin production given her liver dysfunction and also felt that there might be some underlying low grade DIC also involved, however, they agreed with our decision to not transfuse the patient with any blood products in the absence of active bleeding.
The patient's TPN was discontinued and intravenous fluids were discontinued.
