The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
She then developed dense retrocardiac opacity on CXR on [**12-13**] and was started on empiric treatment with Vancomycin and Levaquin for ventilator associated pneumonia.
Patient was very sensitive to sedation and her sedation was difficult to titrate due to either over sedation or agitation.
The rhythm was most likely a SVT with LBBB pattern.
