This is stable from prior studies and is unlikely to be post-traumatic although there may be signficant celiac stenosis.
[**2198-6-4**] Aortic US : There is a focal aortic dissection with a near circumferential luminal plaque in the aorta approximately 4 cm above the bifurcation, in a similar location to the CT examinations.
His CT torso showed a focal aortic dissection at the level of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] with surrounding hematoma.
There was some fluid and blood in the pelvis of unclear source.
The images were extensively reviewed and after a repeat CTA was performed showing a stable abdominal aortic dissection with no active arterial extravasation but increased volume of fluid in the pelvis containing blood, a decision was made to take him to the OR for an exploratory laparoscopy.
Approximately 450 cc of blood identified in the pelvis which was evacuated.
Abdominal crepitus was felt after case, so a CXR was obtained to eval for PTX, which was negative.
His hematocrit remained stable in the 31 range.
Aortic dissection 2.
Hemoperitoneum 3.
Pulmonary contusion 6.
Activity Status: Ambulatory with crutches Touch down weight bearing on left leg.
Multiple scans were done to assess any interval changes in the aorta and they remain the same.
Your blood count has also been stable.
You can walk with crutches and your weight bearing status on the left leg is touch down as opposed to full weight bearing.
