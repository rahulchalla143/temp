EMS arrived and took her to [**Hospital1 **] where her fingerstick blood glucose was 110.
There she was noted to be lethargic with blood pressure of 140/76.
Patient went to CT scan at 2:00pm which showed left temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Repeat head CT at 4:00 pm showed no changed in bleeding.
Physical Exam: Vitals: Temp 98, Pulse 74, Blood Pressure 168/74, RR 12, O2 100% on vent.
Chest: Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Pupils 2.5 to 2 mm reactive to light bilaterally.

----- CT head [**2127-2-14**]: An ill-defined intraparenchymal area of hyperdensity is seen involving the left parietal and temporal lobe measuring approximately 8 cm at its greatest dimension with associated cytotoxic edema.
----- CT head [**2127-2-15**]: There is again seen an area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left parietal and temporal lobes.
There is stable falcine and transtentorial herniation, and stable compression of the left lateral ventricle.
----- CT head [**2127-2-16**]: There is significant motion artifact limiting the evaluation.
The degree of mass effect is greater than on the prior study with continued effacement of the left lateral [**Doctor Last Name 534**], and increased effacement of the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] with increased subfalcine herniation.
Initial exam showed intact corneal reflexex, pupillary reaction, and some strength perservation of left arm.
Mannitol 25 gm q6 with Na and serum osmolality checked prior to each dosing was continued.
Repeat head CT showed stable size of hemorrhage.
Blood pressure was maintained less than 140 systolic.
Interval head CT showed increased size of hemorrhage wtih increased mass effect, midline shift, subfalcine herniation, and effacement of the basilar cisterns.
