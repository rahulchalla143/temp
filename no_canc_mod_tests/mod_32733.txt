She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath, was initially admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3, but had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and delerium which resulted in transfer to the CCU.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2168-3-18**] after a mechanical fall which resulted in a left-sided hip fracture.
serial cardiac enzymes trended down (last 1.53).
Her EKG did not show any ST elevation but did have T wave inversions inferolaterally that deepened throughout her admission.
She was diagnosed with a non-st elevation MI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catherization.
She had a CXR that showed mild diffuse interstitial edema suggestive of congestive heart failure with a normal sized heart.
A TTE showed LV dilation, apical, septal, inferior and anterior akinesis, mild MR, and PA pressure of 38mmHg with LVEF 20%.
She received some fluids and had a 5 point Hct drop (32->27) that was thought to be dilutional.
When she got the the floor, she was delerious, in a fib with rvr with rates >150.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] is more sensitive for subtle lesions or small acut einfarcts.
[**3-24**] Cardiac Cath Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no obstructive coronary artery disease.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Repeat Echo showed mild left regional systolic dysfunction with distal anterior, septal and apical hypokinesis c/w CAD as well as mild mitral regurgitation.
EF 40%.
Cardiac cath showed no focal occlusions and there was no intervention performed.
Anticoagulation was started with coumadin, and INR was up to 2.4 after one dose at 2mg, so this was held for one day and decreased to 1mg daily.
She will need close INR monitoring as outpatient.
Repeat echo shows improvement of EF to 40-45%, which may represent Takutsubo?????
Her head CT weas negative and her mental status returned to baseline by later the following day.
A C diff toxin was sent and is pending at discharge.
You had a cardiac catheterization performed and there was no significant heart disease found.
