She vomited intermittently throughout the day but her nausea is better now.
At the [**Hospital1 882**] ED, she was afebrile, with BP 128/68 and HR 66.
CBC was normal and electrolyte panel was significant for potassium of 3.2.
She had a Head CT that revealed a bandlike hypodensity in the left cerebellum, and subsequent MRI/MRA revealed the aforementioned vertebral dissection and infarct.
Physical Exam: T 96.6 ax   HR 71-72  RR 16  BP 126/74  Pulse Ox 99% RA General appearance: 31 yo female, appears pale, lying very still in bed with head in midline, but in NAD Heart: regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Coordination: The finger/nose and heel/shin test are performed very slowly bilaterally, but accurately.
She was able to sit up without titubation or obvious truncal ataxia, but due to profound vertigo/nausea the exam could not be pursued further.

T1 fat sats show hyperintensity throughout the left extracranial vertebral artery.
MRA shows diminutive left intracranial vertebral artery, but without the source images it is difficult to say if this portion of the vessel is merely hypoplastic.
* * * [**2112-2-20**] CT HEAD No hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage is identified.
* * * [**2112-2-22**] ECHO Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
* * * [**2112-3-4**] CT HEAD FINDINGS: There has been resorption of some of the blood products along the right frontal lobe catheter track.
Plan: Admit to Neurology Stroke Service, floor bed with telemetry monitoring and q2h neuro checks.
- Heparin IV 800 units/hr, goal PTT 40-60.
- EKG, r/o MI - Send ESR, [**Doctor First Name **], CRP, urine and serum tox, HgbA1C, lipids - T/C further hypercoag workup as indicated - RISS, Pantoprazole, pneumoboots  * * *  Brief Hospital Course:  * Neuro:     Ms. [**Known lastname 3501**] was maintained on heparin through most of her admisson.
Serial CT's were performed and on [**2-21**] her CT revealed hydrocephalus.
Follow-up CT demonstrated a small hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe along the tract where the drain was located.
She started coumadin on the night of [**3-1**] and by the time of discharge on [**3-4**] her INR was 1.5.
CT on [**3-4**] did not reveal any hydrocephalus or extension of hemorrhage.
She was discharged home on coumadin 5 mg qHS and aspirin 81 mg.  She should continue the aspirin until her INR is therapeutic, then discontinue the medication.
Echocardiogram revealed no evidence of clot.
Followup Instructions: Follow up with your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 766**] at 1:10 p.m. to have your INR checked, and to have your staples taken out.
