PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 95.2 F.; blood pressure 173 to 200 over 90s; heart rate 70 to 80s; O2 saturation 96 to 98% on room air.
Her general medical examination was unremarkable.
The patient recalled the month several minutes into the examination when asked again.
Initially left pupil appeared nonreactive but on examination it did in fact react to light normally.
Initially her motor examination showed decreased tone on the left.
Head CT scan showed a right thalamic bleed with some intraventricular hemorrhage; no mass effect.
MRI showed right thalamic hemorrhage with considerable susceptibility abnormality but very little alteration and signal in T1 and T2 sequences consistent with recent hemorrhagic containing largely deoxy hemoglobin.
There is a slight increase in the basic edema surrounding the hematoma as compared to the CT scan and very slight displacement of the right lateral ventricles superiorly.
Diffusion weighted images did not show areas of particulate effusion beyond the marked hematoma.
On susceptibility sequence, there was several other very tiny foci of susceptibility noted within the parenchyma of the inferior cerebellum and of the cerebrum, especially on the right side.
MRI of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] showed no evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormalities.
The patient was started on Labetalol drip to attempt to keep her blood pressure less than 150.
A repeat head CT scan on [**2166-7-3**], showed a stable appearance of the bleed.
A urinalysis was sent and was positive for urinary tract infection.
