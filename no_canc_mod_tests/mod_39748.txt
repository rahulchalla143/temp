Brief Hospital Course:   Hypotension/fever/?sepsis: Per [**Hospital1 **] his baseline blood pressure appeared to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52 on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
We believe he was sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.
Review of records with the patient showed that he had had blood cx collected [**7-23**] positive for coag negative staph (susceptible to tetracycline and vanc), as well as a catheter tip w/ coag negative staph also on [**7-23**].
He also had negative blood cx x2 on [**2137-7-31**].
Sputum from [**7-20**] showed moderate Pseudomonas with intermdiate resistance to Amikacin, and pt had Amikacin levels from [**7-31**], but no additional data regarding this treatment was available.
He had two negative C. diff tests [**7-26**] and [**7-28**], and another was sent here, which was also negative.
Blood, urine, and sputum cultures were also sent.
The sputum showed no microorganisms, and the urine culture had no growth.
Blood cultures [**8-6**] showed no growth.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia or acute disease.
Patient's CD4 was sent and the level was 53.
Consideration was also given to removing the PICC as a potential source of infection, but as patient had no evidence of growth on blood cultures or worsening infection, this was left in.
Sputum, blood, and urine cultures were sent on [**8-12**] and showed WBCs and bacteria in urine but never grew any bacteria.
Sputum showed PSA as before.
ID was called for consult regarding whether to get an LP and further workup for infectious cause of fever however they felt that PSA was likely a colonization and fever was central in origin not infections.
Serologies for CMV and EBV were negative.
*** Primary care provider will need to follow up [**Date Range **] blood cultures ***    Sinus Tachycardia: This is believed to be long standing (though unclear etiology); records report [**Hospital1 1501**] dosing of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
His HR continued to range from 90-120, with SBPs in the 90s to 100s and the metoprolol was decreased again to 37.5mg with stable SBPs in 90s and HR 110s.
Sputum intially showed no organisms, and pt was empirically treated with zosyn/cipro.
On [**8-11**], his sputum sensitivities resulted, and he was changed over to [**Month/Year (2) 21347**].
A CT was ordered that showed much progressed PML since [**4-9**].
Had several discussions with mother regarding goals of care, and she intially indicated she did not want patient to be intubated or have chest compressions and then after the results of the CT decided to not escalate his care further.
HIV/AIDS: Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
Recheck of CD4 was 53.
Electrolytes and white count were stable.
Pt was transiently febrile and started on Linezolid for a positive blood culture, but Abx were discontinued b/c culture showed likely contaminant.
His electrolytes and white count are unremarkable.
