Pertinent Results: OSH CT read [**2199-9-20**] Small left frontal ICH without associated mass effect.
Curvilinear parietal extra-axial high attenuation is presumably related to motion artifact, although given the additional ICH, a follow-up CT should be performed to more definitvely exclude a small amount of extra axial blood.
Repeat CT head [**2199-9-21**] Prelim read Small focus of left frontal SAH is unchanged from the OSH CT a few hours earlier.

If concern for spinal cord injury, MRI might be considered.
