Admission Date:  [**2103-10-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-10-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2034-8-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Cephalosporins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**] Chief Complaint: transfer from OSH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: tracheoplasty [**2103-10-19**] tracheostomy [**2103-10-22**]  History of Present Illness: 69M with severe tracheobronchial malacia transferred from OSH for evaluation for possible surgical intervention for definitive tracheal modification.
Given recent courses of antibiotics, patient was treated empirically with flagyl for possible c.diff, but this was later d/c'd when stool cultures returned negative for c. diff x1.
CXR and Chest CT at OSH revealed new R pleural effusion, but no evidence of infiltrate suggestive of PNA.
Preliminiary results: Glucose 68, LDH 1106, TProt 5.4.
Tracheobroncheal malacia, dx [**11-22**]; s/p Y stent placement [**2-20**] and removal [**7-23**] 2.
Pulm HTN 7.
BPH (foley changed [**2-26**], needs to be changed q month- will have laser surgery once resp issues resolved.)
Home O2 (3L at baseline)  Social History: He has worked as a technical writer, a desk job, Lives w/ wife in southern [**Name (NI) **], 3 children, daughter [**Name (NI) **] involved/supportive.
Pertinent Results: [**2103-10-3**] 09:20PM WBC-11.0 HGB-11.5* HCT-32.8* MCV-85 PLT COUNT-368 SODIUM-143 POTASSIUM-3.8 CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-27 UREA N-23* CREAT-1.4* GLUCOSE-148*  CALCIUM-8.9 PHOSPHATE-3.0 MAGNESIUM-2.0  UA pending EKG: Sinus rhythm at 91 with frequent atrial and ventricular ectopy.
[**2103-10-5**] CXR: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There are poor inspiratory lung volumes, with pulmonary vascular crowding.
[**2103-10-9**] PLEURAL FLUID: 10cc Bloody fluid collected, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2103-10-11**] CXR: Since the previous exam, the tracheobronchial stent has been removed.
Stents were followed with serial CXR and chest CT which showed no migration or stents.
CT [**Doctor First Name **] followed pt throughout course of hospitalization.
POD #1-Bronchoscopy was performed on POD #1 and the patient was extubated.
His creatinine also increased despite gentle fluid resuscitation.
Laboratory values at this time demonstrated the patient to be severely acidemic with a bicarbonate of 16 as well as an arterial pH of 7.12.
He continued to deteriorate with decreasing urine output, continuing acidemia, and elevated transaminases to >1000.
A stat echocardiogram was performed at the bedside for a presumed pulmonary embolism which demonstrated a dilated, hypokinetic RV.
A lactate performed at this time reached it's peak at 9.5.
The patient did eventually stabilize hemodynamically and underwent a head, chest and abdominal CT scan.
A preliminary read demonstrated a large R sided pulmonary embolism.
Of note, Urine culture was positive for MRSA at OSH.
However, on [**10-7**] UA was +for UTI, UCulture w/Enterobacter and staph Aureus, so Vanc was continued for Enterobacter UTI.
Although video swallow study was neg for Aspiration, pt aspirated x2 and was continued on levo/flagyl.
On [**10-10**] pt spiked to 102.7 in setting of Levo/Flagyl/Vanc already on board, repeat CXR did not show consolidation, UA [**10-11**] improved from previous UA.
ID was consulted for further evaluation of persistent fevers in setting of ABX coverage.
Levo/Flagyl were d/c'd on [**10-12**] as no clear evidence of Asp PNA/no consolidation noted on imaging studies CXR/CT.
Recommended IP to rebronch thich mucous secretions to r/o pulmonary infectious process prior to CT [**Doctor First Name **].
Pleural Effusion- OSH reported moderate sized pleural effusion with question of underlying infiltrate.
Follow-up pleural fluid results showed histiocytes and blood, no malignant cells.
FEna 0.6% and FEun 33% c/w prerenal etiology and diuretic use.
Echo at OSH [**9-22**] EF 45-50%.
Diarrhea- Stool cx neg for c.diff at OSH.
Will re-send stool cultures for c.diff x3.
