2- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment revealed normal systemic arterial pressure (121/60 mmHg).
The left-sided filling pressures were normal at baseline (LVEDP 11 mmHg, increased to 16 mmHg after LV gram).
3- Left ventriculography revealed normal LVEF (60-65%) without regional wall motion abnormalities or mitral regurgitation.
No significant interval change from prior MR examination from [**2142-5-20**] with no acute infarction or hemorrhage identified.
