[**2202-4-7**] Cardiac Catheterization  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 2916**] is a 86 year old woman with severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.6cm, peak gradient 66mmHg) and coronary artery disease s/p CABG and recent DES to RCA, LCx w/ 80% stenosis-unable to intervene who presented with right-sided chest pressure, which is her typical anginal equivalent.
In brief, angina resolved by time she reached ED, but she had EKG with deepening ST depressions in lateral leads.
CXR showed pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions.
She was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.
Physical Exam: ADMIT EXAM VS: T 93.7 BP 153/39 HR 61 RR 21 O2 93% 2L Gen: elderly woman, grimacing, shallow, labored breathing with mild use of accessory muscles.
CV: [**4-18**] late peaking harsh systolic murmur @ USB and [**2-17**] diastolic murmur.

Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated an elevated right and left heart filling pressures with an RVEDP of 18 mm Hg and an LVEDP of 34 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was low at 2.17 L/min/m2 via the Fick.
Hemodynamics demonstrated a mean gradient of 17 mm Hg across the aortic valve.
The aortic valve area was 0.6 cm2.
Hemodynamics demonstrated equalization of the left ventricle and femoral diastolic pressures indicating significant aortic regurgitation.
A echocardiogram obtained in the cath lab demonstrated moderate - severe (3+) aortic regurgitation.
[**2202-4-13**] Carotid Ultrasound: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
Post Bypass - A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 5 mmHg, peak 11 mmHg).
Of note, preop HIT assays were negative for PF4 Heparin antibodies.
Over several days, her urine output improved as did volume status.
She was transfused with PRBCs to maintain hematocrit near 30% and all narcotics were discontinued.
