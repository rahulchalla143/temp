Her rate 22.
She was given oxygen, and EKG was obtained, which showed PR prolongation and inferior ST segment changes.
She clinically appeared to be in failure, and she was placed on [**Location (un) **] the CK-MB and troponin were positive with CK of 189, MB of 8.1, and the troponin of 2.09.
Echocardiogram at that point 45% to 50%, [**12-21**] mitral regurgitation and a aortic sclerosis.
Congestive heart failure with an EF of 45% to 50%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination upon admission revealed the following:  Vitals significant for a heart rate of 80; blood pressure of 114/70; respiratory rate of 22; oxygen saturation of 97% on three liters nasal cannula.
CARDIAC:  Examination reveals a [**12-24**] early systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, [**11-23**] at the lower left sternal border with normal carotid upstroke, no S3, no S3-4, normal S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurological examination was significant for the patient being alert and oriented times three with no focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs revealed the following: White count of 12.2; hemoglobin of 10.7; hematocrit of 32; platelets of 172; BUN of 36; creatinine of 1.5; sodium 139; potassium 3.6; chloride 97; bicarbonate 30; PT/PTT 14.5/90.7; INR 1.4; CK 189, 343, 277; troponin I-2.09.
The EKG showed sinus rhythm with a normal axis, T-wave inversions inferiorly with flattened V3 and V4.
Cardiac catheterization performed on the day of admission reveals severe left main coronary obstruction and severe obstructions to the left anterior descending, first and second diagonal, first and second circumflex marginal and right posterior descending coronary arteries.
However, twenty-four hours later, the patient developed massive hematoma of the left thigh and inguinal region, which could not be controlled by direct compression.
It was decided to take the patient to the operating room and simultaneous repair of the left femoral artery performing an aortocoronary bypass graft.
The remainder of her stay was only notable for two episodes of anxiety and shortness of breath, which resulted in the cycling of cardiac enzymes despite low suspicion to rule out any myocardial infarction or ischemia.
While in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit the patient was noted to have a creatinine elevation to 2.0.
Throughout the remainder of her hospital course, her creatinine remained elevated ranging from approximately 2.0 after her Intensive Care Unit stay up to 2.4.
Her creatinine was 2.0 and stable at the time of discharge.
The cardiothoracic surgery team debrided the wound and cultures were sent.
Throughout the hospital course, the patient remained with subjective and objective signs of shortness of breath, notable for an oxygen saturation rate ranging from approximately 92 to 96% on an average of two liters of oxygen by nasal canal.
Chest x-rays obtained showed evidence of volume overload with infiltrates in both lung fields inferiorly.
The patient's hematocrit was noted to be consistently, approximately 30% with no known etiology of the anemia.
Her vital signs remained stable and she did not require transfusions to maintain hematocrit of 30%.
The patient's blood sugars remained well controlled throughout much of her stay.
She will require outpatient ob/gyn evaluation for the source of this bleeding.
to keep INR 2.0-3.0 21.
She remains well rate controlled, but will need to continue taking her amiodarone and coumadin, with target INR 2.0-3.0.
