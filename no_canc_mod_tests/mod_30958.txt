Catheterization showed a right dominant system, non-angiographically apparent lesions in LMCA, LAD, and left circumflex, 30% RCA, hemodynamic resting with mean RA 15, C-wedge pressure of 34, diastolic pressure 25, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension with mean PAP of 46, cardiac index of 1.6.
Patient then received Nitroprusside with wedge to 14 and was given milrinone with a wedge of 23 and index of 2 which brought the wedge to 14.
History of mitral regurgitation which was shown on [**8-/2193**] on echo with 1+ mitral regurgitation.
History of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, echo in [**8-/2193**] which showed also an ejection fraction of 35-60%.
History of breast biopsy 16 years ago.

?, pulse 70, blood pressure 153/74, respiratory 18-21, o2 sat 98%.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Normocephalic/atraumatic.
RESPIRATORY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  INR 1.4, PT 14.6.
CBC showed a white blood count of 4.6, hematocrit of 39.7, platelet 197.
Sodium 141, potassium 3.5, chloride 100, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 108, calcium 9.4, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 3.3.
Echo showed LV mildly dilated, 1+ mitral regurgitation, ejection fraction of 35-40%.
She is now status post cardiac catheterization, has 30% right coronary artery lesion.
For her pump the filling pressures improved with Nipride and milrinone and was continued.
The patient's CVP was 8 to 9 at this point, day after, and she was negative two liters by this point.

Cardiac catheterization notable for elevated filling pressures and also coronaries were shown to be 30% right coronary artery lesion and other vessels without angiographically apparent lesions.
To follow up INR with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 7974**].
