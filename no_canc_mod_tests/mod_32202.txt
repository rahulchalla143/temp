Provisional Findings Impression: JRCi SAT [**2123-9-25**] 3:20 PM No new hemorrhage, slight increase in degree of communicating hydrocephalus.
Final Report STUDY: CT head without contrast.
COMPARISON: [**2123-9-19**], CT head.
Linear hyperdensity within the left sylvian fissure is less apparent on the current study (series 2, image 11).
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The left subclavian central line has been pulled back, with tip now at the superior aspect of the SVC, near the junction with the brachiocephalic vein.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Provisional Findings Impression: AFSN SUN [**2123-9-19**] 4:47 PM PFI: Moderate ventriculomegaly with ventricular size increased since the CT of [**2123-9-18**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the head were obtained without contrast.
Following this, using departmental protocol, CT perfusion and CT angiography of the head were acquired.
Correlation was made with the previous CT angiographic examination of [**2123-9-5**].
FINDINGS:  CT HEAD:  There is a moderate dilatation of the ventricles identified with prominent of temporal horns indicative of communicating hydrocephalus.
CT PERFUSION:  CT perfusion demonstrates symmetric mean transit time, blood volume and blood flow bilaterally.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY:  CT angiography demonstrates mild non-occlusive spasm of the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
This is compared with the previous CT examination.
Moderate ventriculomegaly with temporal horns are slightly increased since the previous CT of [**2123-9-18**].
CT angiography demonstrates status post coiling of the basilar tip aneurysm with a small residual portion of the aneurysm on the left mid aspect near the origin of posterior cerebral artery.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain without administration of IV contrast.
Subsequently, rapid axial imaging was performed from the skull base through the brain during the infusion of 80 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast material.
CT HEAD: There is diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage tracking in the sylvian fissures bilaterally, and extending into the interpeduncular cistern.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
