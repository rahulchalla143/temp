He was referred to the emergency department where vital signs were significant for HR 97  190/130 41 70% on facemask.
Chest x-ray showed hypervolemia, pulmonary vascular congestion.
A ABG was obtained which showed respiratory acidosis with a pH 7.20, pCO2 69, pO2 31, HCO3 28, lactate 2.1.
(felt to be venous) CBC showed no abnormalities, chemistry panel showed Cr 1.7 and hyperglycemia.
An EKG was significant for old LBBB and HR 65.

A single-lead pacer device appears unchanged and the distal portion of the lead is poorly assessed given underpenetration.
.. CXR [**2112-1-12**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-11**], there is mild improvement of the still substantial congestive heart failure.
Echo [**2112-1-12**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-8-12**], severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation has decreased.

AN echo following admission demonstrated moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mild pulmonary hypertension.
A left heart cath which revealed unchanged coronary anatomy when compared to prior.
ACTIVE ISSUES # ACUTE DECOMPENSATION OF SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION: The patient presented from his cardiologist's office with acute on chronic progresive dyspnea, crackles on lung exam and elevated BNP, a CXR consistent with pulmonary edema and requiring BIPAP concerning for left sided heart failure.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative.
An echo on HD 2 demonstrated EF 40-45%, with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation,(systemic BP 137) mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mild pulmonary hypertension.
([**2111-8-5**] RVSP in the 60's) Overall echo demonstrated improvement in the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and lower pulmonary pressures when compared to most recent echo in [**2111-8-5**] but at a lower systolic blood pressure.
On HD4 a left heart cath showed right dominant system with no flow limiting disease (patent stent sites) and LVEDP of 10 mmHg, RVEDP of 9 mmHg, CI of 2 l/min/m2 and a mildly elevated SVR and PVR at 1621 dynes-sec/cm5 and 211 dynes-sec/cm5 respectively.
Initial studies including a CT torso without contrast and dental panoramex were performed while the patient was inhouse.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative.
His heart rate and rhythm were monitored throughout the admission and he was continued on is home regimen of carvedilol which was doubled to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Elevated creatinine above 1.5 baseline per cardiologist report likely in the setting of acute decompensation of heart failure and poor forward flow.
In the setting of diuresis mild acute on chronic renal insufficiency tolerated with creatinine increase from 1.7 to 2.1 and a mild metabolic contraction alkalosis.
Diuresis and lisinopril held prior to discharge and renal function improved to 1.6 at the time of discharge.
# HEMOPTYSIS/ COUGH: History of chronic hemoptysis with evaluation by ENT in [**2109**].
Recommendation at that time was to have formal evaluation by pulmonology.
No focal consolidation apparent on admission CXR or sx of fever.
Carvedilol doubled to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and Lasix increased to daily dosing.
