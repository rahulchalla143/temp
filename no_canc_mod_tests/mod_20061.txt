Prior to discharge, today, the patient was noted to have a low-grade fever of 100 degrees for which she was started on levofloxacin for possible pneumonia as she failed a recent speech and swallow evaluation in-house and self-discontinued her nasogastric tube with possible aspiration.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were temperature 97.8, blood pressure 121/59, heart rate 92, respirations 20, saturation 97 percent on two liters.
Lung exam reveals shallow breaths bilaterally with crackles in the right upper lobe and right lower lobe.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cells 15.9, hematocrit 35.9, platelets 382, PT 12.0, PTT 23.8, INR 1.0.
Sodium 129, potassium 7.8 (hemolyzed), repeat 4.7, chloride 95, bicarbonate 25, BUN 33, creatinine 1.0, glucose 258, calcium 9.1, phosphate 2.5, magnesium 2.2.
Urinalysis revealed pH 1.021, moderate blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase, 250 glucose.
TSH 13, free T4 0.9, hemoglobin A1C 7.4, phenytoin 4.4.
Head CT revealed right frontotemporal swelling consistent with contusion, no evidence of blood, no new change compared with a previous CT done on [**2155-1-30**].
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 112.
She was noted to be afebrile with good oxygen saturations in room air with no subjective complaints of shortness of breath or cough.
Her lung exam cleared throughout her brief hospital stay.
Her blood cultures and urine cultures were negative throughout her admission.
A repeat head CT was performed on [**2155-2-11**] which showed no change in her intracerebral hemorrhage.
Given that there were no changes noted on the repeat CT, no further workup is being initiated at this time.
Her rate improved once she received a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, and her beta blocker could be administered.
The patient had an echocardiogram performed on [**2155-2-7**] which was significant for an ejection fraction over 55 percent, borderline pulmonary artery hypertension, and no evidence of pericardial effusion.
Their study was significant for overt signs and symptoms of aspiration with all consistencies assessed.
She will need to have a repeat TSH and free T4 checked approximately one month after this medication change.
