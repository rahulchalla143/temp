The patient's blood sugars were high throughout his hospital stay; likely related to the high-dose steroids that he was receiving.
ACID-BASE ISSUES:  The patient's acid-base status improved to baseline with his bicarbonate trending down from 53 on transfer to the high 30s by discharge.
The patient was not continued on his outpatient Flagyl and was recommended to have close followup.
