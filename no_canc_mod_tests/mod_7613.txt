Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2165-3-4**], there is no significant change.
Blood cultures drawn on [**2166-12-25**] eventually all grew methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus, 6/6 bottles.
Blood cultures from [**12-26**] grew MSSA 1/4 bottles.
Surveillance blood cultures on [**12-27**] and [**12-31**] negative.
Given his Staph aureus bacteremia, a TTE was performed on [**2166-12-31**] which was negative for vegetations.
A TEE was subsequently performed on [**2167-1-6**], which was also negative for vegetations, although it revealed a small ASD.
Hence, plan is to continue Cefazolin 2 gm IV with hemodialysis, counting from [**2166-12-27**] (first negative blood cultures).
CT head and MRI head were consistent with an acute infarct involving the left ventral pons and the posterior left insular cortex, left temporal operculum, and left anterior parietal lobe.
Hence, he underwent a TTE on [**2166-12-31**], which was negative for vegetations.
A carotid ultrasound revealed bilateral <40% stenosis of his carotids.
A TEE was also performed on [**2167-1-6**], which was also negative for vegetations, although it revealed a small ASD.
He is to remain on anticoagulation with goal INR [**1-22**], as well as ASA.
INR 1.3 at discharge.
Permanent vascular access should be delayed until after completion of 6 weeks of IV antibiotics and documentation of sterile blood cultures 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics.

Iron studies on [**2167-1-6**] revealed Fe 43, TRF 148, Ferritin [**2142**], TIBC 192.
Hematocrit 28.8 at discharge.
