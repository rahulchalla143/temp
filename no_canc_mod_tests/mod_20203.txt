At outside hospital ED, he was initially alert and then became tachypnea to the 50s with decreased breath sounds and pulse oximetry 80 percent on nonrebreather.
Because he did not respond to Combivent nebulizers with decreased O2 saturations, he was intubated.
His chest x-ray showed bilateral alveolar diffuse pulmonary infiltrates concerning for ARDS.
He was aggressively resuscitated with IV fluids, and laboratories drawn at outside hospital revealed a white cell count of 17.3 with 77 neutrophils, 9 bands, 13 lymphocytes, and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] ED.

In [**Hospital1 69**] ED, temperature was 102.4, tachycardic to 130s, and repeat chest x-ray showed bilateral interstitial and patchy alveolar infiltrates.
Here his serum tox was negative for aspirin, EtOH, Tylenol, benzodiazepines, TCA, barbiturates, and urine tox was positive for benzodiazepines, opiates, and cocaine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 102.4, pulse 144, blood pressure 85/43, respirations 19-26, oxygen saturation 96 percent on AC 24 x 450, 60 percent FIO2, PEEP 10.
Extremities:  2 plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, no edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 18.3, hematocrit 56.2, platelets of 239.
BUN 17, creatinine 1.0, bicarbonate 25.
