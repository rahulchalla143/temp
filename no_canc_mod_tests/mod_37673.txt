HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 71 year-old male was noted to have an elevated creatinine by routine screen at his primary care physician's office and abdominal ultrasound demonstrated abdominal aortic aneurysm.
A CT scan was performed which demonstrated a 5.4 to 6 cm juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm asymptomatic.
The patient had a PMIBI which was negative and ejection fraction was calculated at 57%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: 98, 60, 16, blood pressure 170/90, O2 saturation 99% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination shows 2+ carotids bilaterally without bruits.
Abdominal examination is soft, nontender, nondistended with a palpable aorta.
The pulse examination shows 2+ radials, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibials bilaterally palpable.
The patient developed overnight oliguria and renal was consulted, recommendations were to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 to 160, volume repletion, rule out for myocardial infarction and cardiac enzymes were negative.
Postoperative day 3 the epidural was discontinued and the patient was put back on assist control for blood gas of 7.29, 37, 114, 19 and 7.
His creatinine was stable at 3.9.
On [**11-27**] his CVL was changed and trialed to wean to extubate which failed.
The patient's tube feeds were held secondary to residuals greater than 150.
CT of the abdomen was obtained which showed gallbladder thickening.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained.
Patient's blood, urine and sputum cultures were all negative.
The urine culture did grow pseudomonas which was pansensitive.
CT scan showed no retroperitoneal hematoma.
After examining the patient and review of the patient's CT and gallbladder ultrasound I felt there was no intra-abdominal source.
Recommendations were serial examinations and re- evaluation if there were clinical changes.
Thoughts were that he might require a bedside swallow but this was reviewed and decided it was not necessary.
A repeat urine culture was sent which was positive for pseudomonas.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol aerosol 1 to 2 inhalations q 6 hours p.r.n., ipratropium bromide aerosol puffs 2 inhalations q 4 to 6 hours p.r.n., acetaminophen 650 mg suppository q 6 hours p.r.n., acetylcholine 20% solution 1 cc aerosol q 4 to 6 hours p.r.n., levofloxacin 250 mg q 4 to 6 hours for a total of 6 more days on [**12-10**] which is day 8 out of 14 days of antibiotic course.
