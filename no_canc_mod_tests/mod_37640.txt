At [**Hospital **] Rehab she had persistent low blood pressures with systolic in the 60s, 70s and heart rate in the 80s.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] and has had persistently low blood pressures in the Emergency Department with systolics less then 90s and heart rate 70s and 80s.
She received 1.5 liters of normal saline in the Emergency Room with slight improvement in her blood pressure.
Chest x-ray showed signs of early congestive heart failure.
Blood cultures times two were sent and Vancomycin, Levo and Flagyl were given.
Tums [**2160**] t.i.d.
Sodium bicarb 650 b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.0.
Heart rate 74.
Blood pressure 68/30.
Respiratory rate 16.
Sating 96% on room air.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac examination S1 and S2, 1 out of [**1-26**] early systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Deep tendon reflexes 1+ bilateral, symmetric throughout, decreased sensation on both lower extremities beyond knees.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 15.4, hematocrit 32.1, platelets 654, MCV 91, 76.8 neutrophils, 18.2 lymphocytes, 6.7 monocytes, 3.4 eosinophils.
Chemistry sodium 138, potassium 5.8, chloride 92, bicarb 22, BUN 52, creatinine 8.2, glucose 152, PTT 31.0, INR 1.6.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 82 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals.
Chest x-ray mild upper vascular redistribution, questionable retrocardiac air bronchogram.
The patient had a random Cortisol tested, which was slightly low at 20.8.
Later on in the hospital course a possible friction rub was noted and the patient had an echocardiogram performed, which showed mild to moderate pericardial effusion new from echocardiogram done a month ago.
It is possible that this pericardial effusion may have contributed to her hypotension, however, while she was on the floor the patient's blood pressure remained stable above 100 between 120 and 100.
The patient had repeat electrocardiograms done, which showed no significant change and the echocardiogram showed no signs of tamponade.
The patient was started on Florinef along with the Midodrine, which was continued at 2.5 mg b.i.d.
The patient's blood cultures remained negative and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial cardiac enzymes.
The patient will be scheduled for a repeat echocardiogram in four days in order to asses interval change in the effusion.
with improvement in her abdominal distention.
The patient had an echocardiogram, which showed no significant change except for the pericardial effusion.
The patient will have a repeat echocardiogram done on Friday to assess for interval change.
Heel ulcers:  The patient was seen by podiatry who felt that the heel ulcers were not infected and there was no need for antibiotics.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient will have a repeat echocardiogram Friday [**6-1**] at 1:00 p.m.  She has a follow up appointment scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19511**] on [**6-4**] at noon time and a follow up appointment scheduled with podiatry with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22889**] on Friday [**5-8**] at 10:50 a.m.  She should continue hemodialysis as before and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**].
