She underwent an ERCP at that time and had a stent placed in the CBD.
She was given a nebulizer and a MICU eval was requested.
An ABG and CXR were requested and given the patient's history of CHF and the fact that she takes daily lasix and received almost 1L of fluid in several hours, a dose of 40mg IV lasix was suggested as well.
CXR was confirmatory for diffuse perihilar infiltrates characteristic of pulmonary edema.
Anesthesia placed an a-line and then obtained an ABG which was 7.30/66/93 and after several hundred cc's of diuresis, it improved to 7.34/63/98 (on 6L facemask).
She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

Cholagiogram showed the presence of 2 stones in the distal CBD.
Balloon sweeps were done to remove the stones.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x 3.
Blood gas analysis suggests improvement of respiratory acidosis with bipap 10/5/5L, likely chronic compensatory metabolic alkalosis.
A cxr was obtained at that time which showed prominent pulmonary edema.
The patient's diuretic regimen was increased to 40mg po bid however her serum creatinine continued to rise and her lasix was held.
Her oxygen saturation however has remained stable at her baseline requiring 2Liters nasal canula to maintain oxygen saturation at 92-94%.
2. s/p ERCP - patient is stable from an ERCP perspective with successful removal of stone from CBD and subsequent sphincterotomy.
Cardiac Ischemia - known CAD s/p MI, CABG.
Given her history of CAD, a lipid panel was obtained showing evidence of hypercholesterolemia with a cholesterol total of 259, LDL 158, and triglycerides 250.
She was started on lipitor 20mg po daily and will need to have her LFTs monitored in the future.
ARF - unclear baseline creatinine, prior cr of 1.5 suggesting likely CKD at baseline.
As discussed above, her creatinine rose to a maximum of 2.6 and we felt this was likely attributed to lower BP (systolics in the 110s) in combination with diuresis.
On the day of discharge her serum creatinine is 1.7.
She will need future monitoring of her renal function while at rehab.
She is currently subtherapeutic and will need continued coagulation panels.
Depression, anxiety, ?psychosis - continue ritalin, lexapro - continue to hold all sedating meds .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1439**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13089**] Care Center - [**Location (un) 1439**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory failure Acute renal failure Altered mental status Secondary diagnoisis: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Coronary Artery Disease Dyslipidemia Stroke   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Patient should continue on 2L nasal canula titrated to keep oxygen saturation between 90-92% given her CO2 retention.
She will require daily monitoring of her serum creatinine while her lasix dose is titrated back to her baseline.
