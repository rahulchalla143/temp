Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
* Abd CT [**2103-1-21**]: 1.
The patient's oxygen saturation was stable and the patient had no respiratory distress while in house.
By CT SBO appears in distal ileum, ?Meckel's vs volvulus since the patient had not had any previous abdominal surgeries making adhesions a less-likely cause.
# GI bleed: While hospitalized the patient had 2 episodes of maroon colored, guaiac positive stools.
She underwent a colonoscopy which revealed multiple diverticuli but no active bleeding and noted that the terminal ileum was patent.
#  Acute Renal Failure:  Pt had a Cr of 2 on admission.
