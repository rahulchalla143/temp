The patient was initially seen at the [**Last Name (un) 4068**] Emergency Department and noted to have the above mentioned findings on CT and was transferred for further evaluation by the trauma team.
During her initial evaluation and transfer the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
Blood pressure 124/64.
Heart rate 88.
Respiratory rate 24.
Satting 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
HEENT examination pupils are equal, round and reactive to light from 3 to 2 bilaterally.
Respiratory rate clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Rectal examination heme negative.
INITIAL DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  CBC white blood cell count 2.8, hematocrit 16.8, platelets 120.
Chemistries sodium 147, potassium 3.8, chloride 118, bicarb 15, BUN 28, creatinine 1.2, glucose 84, lactate 0.7.
Trauma portable chest x-ray and pelvis was negative.
CT of head with contrast revealed fluid within the sphenoid sinus potentially concerning for occult skull base fracture without obvious fractures seen and a small asymmetric fossa of hyperdensity in the left basal ganglia potentially consistent with small focus of hemorrhage versus calcification.
CT of the C spine with reconstruction without evidence of fracture.
CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was without evidence of acute injury.
Closed head injury:  Given the findings mentioned above on the initial head CT in the Emergency Department the patient was admitted to the CICU for q one hour neurological checks and neurosurgery was consulted.
Repeat head CT on the [**2-20**] indicated no change in the fluid seen in the sphenoid sinus or the potential with basal ganglia hemorrhage, however, a small to medium size subacute subdural hemorrhage was seen around the left frontal and temporal regions.
Given this and the stability of findings on head CT, there was nor further need for intervention or imaging.
Neck injury:  The patient was initially transferred for the concern of a potential fracture of C3 spinous process on initial imaging at [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital.
These findings were not demonstrated on CT C spine with reconstruction here at the [**Hospital1 69**].
The patient was unable to cooperate with flexion and extension plain films to further evaluate the stability of her cervical spine.
Urinary tract infection:  Urinalysis showed greater then 50 white blood cells per high powered field with many bacteria with urine cultures growing out E-coli.
Initially was noted to have a hematocrit of 16 upon presentation to this facility upon which value of the decision and to transfuse 1 unit of packed red blood cells was initiated.
However, repeat laboratory draws revealed a CBC with a hematocrit of 26, which is at the patient's baseline.
The patient remained guaiac negative throughout her hospital stay and hemodynamically stable.
