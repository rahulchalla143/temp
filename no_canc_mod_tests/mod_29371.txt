On [**2143-3-12**] he was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have the following stenoses: LMCA- 20%; LAD- ostial 90%, mid 70%, dist apical 80%, large diag subtotal occluded; LCX- ramus 80%, 70% tubular stenosis, OM1 70%, OM2 severe.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP = 14 mmhg, mean PCWP 25 mmhg with prominent v waves).
Cardiac output and index were depressed at 3.4 and 1.7 L/min/m2 respectively.

Pertinent Results: ECG [**Location (un) 620**]: atrial fibrillation, 76bpm, likely old anterior wall MI with Q waves in anterior precordial leads.
ECG [**Hospital1 18**]: atrial fibrillation, 83 bpm, q waves V1, V3, V4.
Follow up PA and lateral chest radiograph after resolution of pulmonary edema is recommended to further assess for resolution and to exclude a neoplastic nodule in this area.
3) Right hilar lymphadenopathy, which may be reactive.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP = 14 mmhg, mean PCWP 25 mmhg with prominent v waves).
Cardiac output and index were depressed at 3.4 and 1.7 L/min/m2 respectively.
Left heart cathererization did not reveal evidence of systemic hypotension.
TECHNIQUE: Gated axial multidetector CT images of the chest were obtained with 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.
Multiplanar reformatted 2D and 3D images were obtained.
CHEST CT ANGIOGRAM: There are no filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature to suggest pulmonary embolism.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reformatted images were essential for delineating the pulmonary vascular anatomy.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
3) Right hilar lymphadenopathy, which may be reactive.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

He eventually required the placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump for optimization of his corornary perfusion and cardiac output while awaiting surgery.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Systolic, with EF 35-40%.
His oxygenation did not improve drastically, and it was considered that much of his hypoxia was due to an infectious process / mulit-lobular pneumonia since it was not improving and he had a persistent leukocytosis.
sepsis/ rising creatinine/ PNA on CT chest and evaluated again by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Platelets and FFP infused simultaneously for platelets 56K and elevated INR.
