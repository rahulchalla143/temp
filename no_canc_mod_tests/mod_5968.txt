Cardiac catheterization [**2132-12-14**]:  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
[**2132-12-15**] Echo: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2043-12-12**], the basal inferolateral and inferior walls are now hypokinetic.

Will obtain echo and trend biomarkers.
ECG showed ST elevations, and she was brought to cath lab again.
Successful PTCA and stenting of large OM1 with two overlapping 2.25x12 MiniVision bare metal stents postdilated to 2.5mm.
Do not stop Plavix without first speaking to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
Her peak CK was 4332 in the setting of extensive chest pain and manipulation of coronary arteries.
Her creatinine increased to 1.3 after contrast load, currently at 1.2. .
# Acute systolic Dysfunction: The echocardiogram of [**2132-12-15**] showed reduced LVEF of 30% in the setting of STEMI.
Although cardiac catheterization showed high filling pressures, she has appeared euvolemic with no signs of fluid overload and has not required standing diuretics.
Her Lisinopril was decreased to 5 mg daily.
she should have daily weights and close monitoring of her fluid status.
Decision made to treat with ASA and Plavix only given hx of falls and likelihood that EF will increase in the long term.
Her blood sugars were quite high with stress dose steriods but are now normalizing on a slightly decreased lantus dose.
# Hypertension: SBP was somewhat low so her Imdur and Norvasc was not restarted and her Lisinopril was decreased to 5 mg daily.
