Her echo showed preserved EF, no evidence of embolic source and no PFO.
Her blood sugars were difficult to control in the context of having her home metformin and glyburide held.
Her blood pressures were also difficult to control and after a period of 3 days during which most of her BP meds were held in an attempt to allow her BP to autoregulate in the aftermath of her stroke, she was restarted on her home regimen, and her lisinopril was increased to 10 mg daily.
Her lipid panel showed elevated lipids including an LDL of 113, and so her lipitor was increased from 20 to 80 mg daily and zetia 10 mg daily was added.
She failed her S/S eval and she subsequently received meds and tube feeds through an NG tube.
On discharge, her neurological exam was significant for right arm and leg weakness in the 4/5 range, dysphagia, and dysarthria with language output limited to stating name and answering simple yes/no questions.
