CT head [**1-14**]:  No acute intracranial pathology including no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR [**1-14**]:  Bilateral asymmetric opacities representing either multifocal pneumonia vs asymmetric pulmonary edema with infection more likely given lack of widening of the vascular pedicle.
Abd/pelvis CT [**1-14**]: Bilateral parenchymal consolidations in both lower lobes posteriorly, and there are multiple nodular densities in the right middle lobe.
C-spine film (prelim): Limited exam due to patient motion.
speech and swallow evaluation [**2131-1-29**]: RECOMMENDATIONS: 1.

regarding rythym, pt with increased ventricular ectopy starting [**1-29**], and noted to have transient self-limited episodes of bradycardia to the 30's.
TTE performed which was unremarkable, sinus tachycardia was attributed to pt's PEs, and EP consult was obtained to evaluate bradycardia, which were felt to be vagal (gradual slowing observed on telemetry), and not requiring intervention as they were asymptomatic.
