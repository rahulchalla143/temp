A CXR revealed worsening Right middle lobe infiltrate from prior study, with a questionable LLL infiltrate as well.
ABG revealed PaO2 63.
PT was given Tamiflu for concern for influenza, and the CT study was sent to radiology for a 2nd read.
She was taken off bipap here and subsequently she satted 88% on 4L NC with RR 40s.
She was switched to non-rebreather with RR high 30s, and then placed on BIPAP with RR 20s, FiO2 60, with O2 Sat high 90s.
ABG was performed on BiPap with PaO2 86.
An informal bedside echo in the ED revealed no RV strain, and her EKG revealed no R heart strain.
A Trop and BNP are pending (sent for prognosis of PE).
PT has a Flu swab, blood cx at [**Hospital3 4107**] none here.
Access:20 g and 18g IVF: 1L at OSH, nothing here Vitals: afebrile, HR 103, BP 120-130/82, RR 25 on BIPAP satting 95%.

DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2132-2-1**]):       Negative for Influenza B.
[**2132-2-1**] 6:17 pm SPUTUM      Source: Expectorated.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2132-2-1**]):       <10 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2132-2-3**]):       SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       YEAST.
IMAGING:  CT CHEST ([**2132-1-31**]): 1.
The examination is suboptimal for assessment of pulmonary emboli to the subsegmental levels, No large PE is detected.
If there remains a high clinical concern for small emboli, a repeat CTA could be considered.
CXR ([**2132-2-1**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-31**].
Brief Hospital Course: 29 yo F smoker with no other significant PMHx presents with dry cough and worsening dyspnea over 3 days, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on BiPap for hypoxia with chest CT showing multifocal pneumonia.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Multifocal pneumonia:  CTA chest from [**Hospital1 **] showed multifocal pneumonia and possible pulmonary embolisms, so patient arrived on heparin gtt.
Influenza and urine legionella were sent and found to be negative.
Sputum was sent and only showed yeast (normal respiratory flora).
She tolerated activity (including stairs) with sats of 95% room air, so it was felt that she could be discharged to home.
