A CMV viral load was rechecked (970) and repeat VL of 4059 on [**11-2**].
In the ED, she had a temp to 100.3, bp 85/48 so levophed was started and she was transferred to the MICU.

CT ABD and PELVIS 1.
Transplanted kidney shows decreased enhancement consistent with history of evolving transplant failure.
Repeat CXR: Compared to AP single view CXR on [**2149-11-6**].
New, however, is a density occupying the left lower lobe basal portion and obliterating the diaphragmatic contours, most likely representing a new retrocardiac atelectasis, not identified on the next previous study of [**11-6**].
In the right mid lung field, a plate atelectasis is seen, but appears as before.
RENAL U/S [**2149-11-11**]: FINDINGS: The transplant kidney is again seen in the right lower quadrant and it measures 12.1 cm in length.
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images were obtained.
Note is made that the Doppler images were limited by the patient's body habitus.
Somewhat limited Doppler exam demonstrating essentially appropriate transplant vasculature.
Similar size and appearance of the subcutaneous hematoma in the right lower quadrant.
ECHO [**2149-11-12**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-8-6**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced (but was only mild on review of the prior study).
CT abd/pelvis showed uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis.
All other culture data and infectious workup (including c. diff toxin negative x 3) was unrevealing as to another source of infection.
Due to asymptomatic relative hypotension after transfer to the medical floor, midodrine was started with improvement in blood pressure.

The following medication changes were recommended: 1) Started ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic.
