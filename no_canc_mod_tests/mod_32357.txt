She was found to be volume overloaded with low 02 sats, had 2 CXR 3 hours apart showing interval development pulmonary edema, placed on BiPAP and treated with diuresis and subsequently came off bipap.She went to the ICU, became hypotensive, started on low dose dopamine and neeosynephrine for BP support with dopa dc'd by time of transfer.
On arrival, had EKG showing dynamic EKG changes (inferolateral TWI) with trop tI initially 0.01 on [**2177-2-12**] then 1.06 without accompanying CKs.
On arrival to the ICU EKG showed dynamic TWI inversions, stable ST depressions, prominent R waves in precordial leads, ?

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
CXR ([**2177-2-13**]) - IMPRESSION: Increased perivascular haze in lung upper zones and left side, possibly beginning pulmonary edema.
Echo showed tethered MV, overall more consistent with chronic MR. Troponin peak likely secondary to CHF, versus poor clearance in the setting of renal failure.
Cardiac enzymes trended down.
Urine lytes showed Feurea 35, indicating a pre-renal state.
Creatinine was improving at the time of discharge.
Her WBC was improving at the time of discharge, and she was afebrile.
Additionally, her creatinine should be followed.
Her metformin can be restarted if her creatinine continues to improve.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Troponin leak Hypotension Acute renal failure  Secondary - Type II Diabetes Hyperlipidemia Depression   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Mental Status: Confused - always   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for a procedure to evaluate your heart.
You were treated with medications to improve your breathing difficulties and have improved.
Your doctors should follow your creatinine (measure of renal function) and restart your metformin if this improves.
