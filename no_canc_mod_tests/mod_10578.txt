Head CT revealed diffuse white matter disease with evidence of edema, but no bleed.
Lumbar puncture was slightly bloody, although decreased white count from tubes one through four.
She was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.
Patient had been treated for a urinary tract infection with Bactrim and was noted to have a zoster rash on her back, which was noted at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.
CT scan was reviewed with Radiology and felt not to be consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Heart rate 86-96.
Blood pressure 105-117/55-63, breathing at 12-13, 02 saturation 98%.
Arterial blood gas was 7.43, 44, 86 on SIMV with pressures 700 x 12, FIO2 of .5, PEEP of 5, pressure support was 5.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES FROM [**Hospital3 **] HOSPITAL:  White blood cell count 15.3, hematocrit 56.2 with a differential of 90 neutrophils, 4 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes, platelets 136,000, INR 1.4, PTT is 25, sodium 140, potassium 4.5, chloride 99, bicarbonate 33, BUN 44, creatinine 1.3, glucose 125, albumin 3.7, calcium 9, magnesium 2.1, TSH was 5.3, T4 7, T3 uptake 41, theophylline was 6.4, which is subtherapeutic.
Ammonia was 36.
ALT 31, AST 25, alkaline phosphatase 112, T bilirubin .8, total protein 6.9.
Electrocardiogram shows sinus arrhythmia with ST elevations in V1 and V2 and nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
Cerebrospinal fluid tube one shows 2 white cells, 150 red cells, glucose of 75, protein 225.
Head CT demonstrated white matter disease, left cerebral edema with compression of the lateral ventricle, no gross shift, question of air bubbles.
The patient's work-up at [**Hospital1 **] included an MRI of her head which showed diffuse cerebral edema.
MRA and MRV were normal and electroencephalogram showed frontal spike on the left with a diffusely slow background.
The culture results from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital revealed HSV2 positive PCRs.
The Infectious Disease Service was not convinced that her clinical picture was consistent with HSV2, they felt it was more likely to be consistent with HHV6.
Her neurologic exam at that time showed that her eyes were open at baseline.
Full elevation and depression of eyes, right lateral gaze was intact, capable of moving eyes to the left, but incomplete motion.
Sensory examination showed that the patient was capable of localizing painful stimuli.
Repeat MRI showed some regression of the T2 hyperintensity white matter changes, especially in the centrum semiovale and a possible increase in cerebral blood flow.
On [**3-21**], the patient was examined during morning pre rounds and found to have an arterial blood gas of pH 7.25, PCO2 of 95, PO2 of 56.
She was found to have an 02 saturation of 57%.
An arterial blood gas was done at that time pH 7.38, PO2 was 32, PCO2 was 69.
Follow-up arterial blood gas was pH 7.39, pCO2 72, PO was 79.
