Compared to prior EKG from [**2170-5-11**]: A-V paced rhythm w left axis, wide QRS.
Prior EKG from [**11-17**]: Ectopic atrial rhythm w normal axis; the precordial Twave inversions and lateral flattening are not present.
CXR [**2171-9-14**]: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
TTE [**2171-9-16**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2166-7-23**], new regional left ventricular systolic function is now present c/w interim infarction/ischemia.
Cardiac cath [**2171-9-16**]: 1.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated systemic arterial hypertension (153/65 mmHg), mild pulmonary arterial hypertension (38/19/26 mmHg), and mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures (mean RAP 11mmHg, RVEDP 13 mmHg, mean PCWP 13 mmHg).
Cardiac index was severely depressed (1.6 L/min/m2).
Non-contrast CT pelvis [**2171-9-20**]: Small hematoma in the right proximal thigh anteriorly but no evidence of lower abdominal or pelvic retroperitoneal hematoma.
# NSTEMI->STEMI: Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] presented to the hospital after having six hours of substernal chest pressure which had resolved on its own.
Her cardiac enzymes were elevated and peaked with a troponin-T of 1.9.
She presented with T-wave inversions in V2-V4 and Twave flattening in V5-V6 on EKG; serial EKGs showed impressive T-wave changes, deepening T-waves in V1-V6 with no ST depressions or elevations.
She was being treated with IV heparin while awaiting cardiac catheterization when she was noted to have marked ST elevations on telemetry.
Catheterization revealed 3 vessel disease with subtotal 80-90% occlusion of her mid LAD.
Echocardiogram showed EF 30-35%.
# Anemia: Patient's hematocrit dropped from 40->28 in the course of her hospitalization.
Over the last 3 days of her hospitalization, her hematocrit remained stable.
Nevertheless, a CT pelvis was obtained and did not show evidence of retroperitoneal bleed or significant hematoma.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Shortly after her cardiac cath, Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] had low blood pressures and low urine output.
However, several days later she became somewhat volume overloaded on exam and required some gentle IV diuresis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 537**]- [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: STEMI (heart attack)  Secondary Diagnosis: NSTEMI (heart attack) Acute on Chronic systolic heart failure Arthritis Blood loss Anemia Hypertension  Discharge Condition: All vital signs were stable.
