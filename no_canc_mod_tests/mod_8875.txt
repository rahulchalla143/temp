CBC showed WBC 5.9, Hgb 10, plt 118 with neutrophilia.
Coags were significant for INR 8.7, PTT 55.5.

# Sepsis/cholangitis: Patient meets sepsis criteria on presentation with fever, tachpynea with blood cultures suggestive of high grade bacteremia from GNR (in OSH cultures).
CXR not suggestive of pulmonic process initially.
Intra-abdominal imaging and US at OSH not suggestive of gallstone or other acute intraabdominal process however given RUQ pain, elevated LFTs/Tbili, and fever, ERCP was performed with sphincterotomy, decompression with extraction of pus and stone.
CXR was without pulmonary edema or other pulmonic process but did have cardiomegaly.
Patient given several doses of lasix IV (80mg) after FFP administration, with moderate UOP and stable oxygenation saturation in the mid90s.
Echo showed preserved function.
Patient is at aspiration risk, and though she's been given nectar thick liquids, she may have aspirated contributing to her oxygen sats in the low 90s at times, and repeat chest xray suggested possible aspiration pneumonia in the mid left and lower lung zones.
At time of discharge INR was 2.8.
Baseline Cr around 1.3, but was up to 1.5 during [**Month (only) **].
No evidence of DVT on LENI U/S performed at [**Hospital1 18**] this [**Hospital1 **].
INR was temporarily reversed for ERCP and warfarin was restarted within 36hrs of procedure.
