Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed of the IJ, subclavian and axillary veins on the left and of the IJ on the right.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
On arrival active patient medications included Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and sedation with Fentanyl 50 mcg/hr and Midazolam 4 mg/hr.
Also, a history suspicious for Patient was sent for urgent MRA of head & neck and MR of head which showed:  1)No enhancing lesions.
Patient was initially seen on unit by Neurology who recommended continuation of Keppra, EEG to evaluate for seizure activity, ECHO for new murmur + fever, LP when INR < 1.5, and an increase in versed drip with consideration of dilantin load if patient seized again.
HD#2 ([**2131-8-3**]):  Patient received Tylenol for fever overnight and had ECHO and EEG in the morning.
ECHO showed no signs of valvular vegetations and EEG showed no signs of an epileptiform focus.
In the setting of seizure + fevers meningitis remained at the top of our differential diagnosis and an LP was arranged.
Prior to admission patient had taken coumadin for his atrial fibrillation and on transfer to MICU initial INR was 2.5, patient was initially given 3 units of FFP with following INR=1.7.

ETT was advanced 1 cm after CXR showed approx 5 cm above the carina.
Patient with long history of ulcerative colitis, but stool sample sent for C.diff toxin which was negative.
Urine output was noted to be poor, patient putting out approximately 15 cc/hr.
Two fluid boluses of 500 cc were given with no effect.
In light of negative blood/CSF/urine cultures acyclovir, ampicillin and ceftriaxone were discontinued.
Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] continued to take Vancomycin for [**8-4**] sputum culture that grew 2+ G(+) cocci in pairs and clusters and Flagyl for empiric tx of C.diff diarrhea despite negative stool toxin screens.
CT of chest with contrast showed:  1)bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis & consolidation, left>right, 2)2 small pulmonary nodules in RUL ~4 cm in diameter, 3)airspace disease in the LUL, and 4)coronary artery and mitral annulus calcifications.
HD#5 ([**2131-8-6**]):  Patient continued to be febrile, reaching temperature of 102 degrees overnight.
Urine output continued to be poor, patient was given one-time dose of lasix IV 40 mg with transient increase in UOP.
HD#7 ([**2131-8-8**]):  Patient placed back on Pressure Support with PS 15/PEEP 8 (increased from [**11-7**]).
ABG showed 7.44/33/102/23.
During late afternoon/evening patient was dosed once again with lasix 20 mg IV with repeat Cr 1.8. .
Urine sent for urine lytes (Na, BUN, creatinine), urine eosinophils, microscopic analysis.
Lasix held today, monitoring Cr for improvement of [**Last Name (un) **].
Throacic ultrasound performed to look for possible empyema/loculated plueral effusions and did not reveal any significant fluid collection that would benefit from throacentesis.
Patient remained on AC vent overnight, RISBI in the a.m. 103, mid-day ABG on AC 7/46/36/106.
Patient maintained own ventilation for 30 min at which time respirations were ~40/min, SaO2 92% and patient having difficulty breathing.
Trial was stopped and patient put back on pressure support with PS 5/PEEP 0.
ID consulted for further work-up of FUO.
Renal US showed no evidency of hydronephrosis.
Had CT of head/sinuses which showed no acute sinusitis with mild mucosal thickening and non-contrast CT of chest & abdomen which showed: 1.

Received 1 gm vanc when afternoon levels 13.5.
Patient had TEE which showed no vegetations and severely deformed aortic valve.
D/C'd doxycycline per ID recs and had repeat CXR due to increased airway secretions and concern over ?aspiration while taking a.m. medications.
Na noted to be 149 and given 1L D5W over 24 hours.
Repeat CXR showed marginal worsening infiltrates in the RML.
[**8-15**] LENI and L UENI show no DVT, CT chest same day showing new bilat LL consolidation concerning for aspiration, bridging small-to-moderate pleural effusions and new hydrostatic pulmonary edema.

-daily CXR -PT to evaluate for rehab.
TEE done, blood and urine negative to date, cdiff negative, csf negative.
[**8-4**] blood culture showing not growth.
[**8-11**] Non-contrast CT of head/chest/abdomen for eval of possible sinusitis and surveillance of occult focus of infection =>no infectious source.
-Lyme, -HSV, C.diff toxin B negative.
Zosyn renally dosed to 2.25 gm IV Q6 hours, back on scheduled vanc 750 mg IV daily, follow vanc levels - check routine vanc levels.
- f/u [**8-15**] and [**8-17**] blood cultures as well as [**8-11**] fungal/AFB cultures.
Urine lytes show no eosinophiluria, FENa and FEuria indicate intrinsic renal etiology of [**Last Name (un) **].
- Cr stable, monitor daily - Renal consult, appreciate recs - Dose medications for patient's creatinine - continue lasix gtt, stop if Cr >2.5.
5)Atrial fibrillation: Patient remains in atrial fibrillation; confirmed by EKG on admission to OSH and [**Hospital1 18**].
Patient will need aggressive rate control to decrease stress to heart.
[**2131-8-3**] MRA head/neck and MR of head show no new enhancing lesions.
Same day ECHO for new murmur showed no vegetations and EEG showed no epileptiform focus.
9)FEN: - speech & swallow evaluation shows okay to take pre-thickened nectar feeds, however will initially feed via NGT s/p extubation.
- repeat speech & swallow study in the AM - restart Nutren full-strength tube feedings tonight at 10 cc/hr with goal of 45 cc/hr, advance as tolerated and checking residuals Q6 hours .
Per ID okay to D/C vanc (18 day course total) 4)  Follow-up 9/12 & [**8-17**] blood cultures, [**8-11**] fungal/AFB culture 5)  Wean 02, continue chest PT and 6)  Speech & swallow to perform video swallow eval once mental status improves 7)  Screen for rehab 8)  f/u PT/OT consult on day of transfer, OOB with assistance.
