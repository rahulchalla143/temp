Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per minute.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is an 83-year-old gentleman with hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation complicated by diastolic heart failure, hypertension, and a pneumonia.
Several trials have been made to optimize his blood pressure and heart rate which were unsuccessful and then being able to extubate him upon awakening.
The patient was started on Lopressor and removed all of his diltiazem to control his heart rate, and the patient was started on captopril to control his blood pressure.
Trials using diltiazem drips and nitroglycerin to control his blood pressure and heart rates were unsuccessful.
PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient grew out Staphylococcus aureus (coagulase-positive) from two sputum cultures which at this time is being treated with a course of oxacillin for 14 days.
He received a 7-day course also of Levaquin, but no pathogens were grown out except the Staphylococcus aureus from his sputum, for which he was placed on oxacillin.
MILD CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had an echocardiogram which showed the left ventricular cavity size was normal and regional left ventricular wall motion was normal.
Therefore, the patient was felt to be in diastolic heart failure and optimizing of his blood pressure and heart rate were attempted to be obtained before extubation so that he would try to prevent flash pulmonary edema which we thought might be leading to him having wheezes rather than just his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Blood cultures were sent and were still pending.
The patient received several fluid boluses with goals of obtaining a central venous pressure of 12, and his hypertensive medications were held.
