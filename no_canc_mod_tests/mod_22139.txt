The pregnancy was complicated by an exploratory laparotomy at 5 weeks of gestation to rule out ovarian torsion.
Apgars were 7 and 7.
Since weaning off oxygen, he has remained in room air with breath sounds clear and equal and respiratory rates between 30's to 60's.
Cardiology:  Upon admission, the infant required a normal saline bolus and dopamine to maintain mean blood pressures in an acceptable range.
The murmur remained and on day of life six, [**7-13**], an echocardiogram was obtained and confirmed the PDA.
Blood pressures have ranged from systolics in the 60's to low 70's, diastolics in the 30's and mean blood pressures in the mid 40's to low 50's.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  The infant was initially NPO with maintenance IV fluids and peripheral nutrition.
His last set of complete electrolytes were on day of life 51, [**8-27**], with a sodium of 135, potassium 5.5, chloride 96, bicarb 29.
On [**2131-10-5**] he had a Ca of 10.4, Phosphorus of 5.8, and an alkaline phosphatase of 917.
The elevation of his phosphatase does not appear to be of a nutritional deficiency (osteopenia of prematurity) as his calciums and phosphoruses have all been in acceptable ranges.
Likewise, an elevation in alk phos is unlikely to be due to a hepatitis as his liver function tests also obtained at the same time are normal - ALT 23, AST 41.
Admission growth parameters: weight 720 gms = 25-50%; L 35 cm = >50%; HC 23.5 cm = just less than 50%.
Discharge growth parameters (day of life 91, corrected gestational age 38 1/7 weeks): weight 2185 gms = <10%; L 46 cm = 10-25%; HC 33 cm = just <50%.
Gastrointestinal:  The maximum bilirubin was 4.5/0.4.
His last bilirubin was on day of life 20, [**7-27**], was 2.2/0.8.
Hematology:  Upon admission, a hematocrit was 49.8, platelets 255.
His blood type is O+.
His last hematocrit was done on Friday, [**10-5**], the hematocrit was 28.4 with a reticulocyte count of 3%.
White count was 4.4 with 14 polys and 0 bands.
Blood cultures were sent.
Blood cultures were negative and ampicillin and gentamicin were discontinued after 48 hours.
On day of life seven, another sepsis evaluation was performed.
White count was 5.9 with 13 polys and 0 bands with an ANC of 767.
A blood culture was sent which revealed gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
On day of life 43, [**8-19**], another sepsis evaluation was performed.
On day of life 52, for some fevers, another sepsis evaluation was performed.
All blood cultures were negative as well as HSV PCR.
This, however, resolved spontaneously, and subsequent state screens demonstrated normal thyroid function tests (specimen dates [**2131-8-18**] and [**2131-9-15**]).
Neurology:  Due to gestational age of less than 32 weeks, serial head ultrasound screenings were performed.
The dates were [**7-9**], [**7-16**], [**7-23**], [**8-8**] and [**10-2**].
Audiology:  Hearing screen was performed with automated auditory brainstem responses and he passed in both ears.
Ophthalmology:  Due to his extreme prematurity with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks and birth weight less than 1500 gm, he qualified for serial eye examinations to evaluate for retinopathy of prematurity.
His last exam was Friday, [**10-5**], and the results were stage 2, zone 2 with 3 clock hours bilaterally.
Carseat positioning screen was done prior to discharge and the infant passed.
State newborn screening tests were sent per protocol with notable results as stated above under 'Endocrine'.
DTaP [**9-13**], HIB [**9-13**], IPV [**9-13**] and Prevnar [**9-13**].
