Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe left main and two vessel coronary artery disease.
Abdominal aortography demonstrated mild tapering of the distal aorta, a 60% proximal left renal artery stenosis, and mild bilateral common iliac artery plaquing to 30% on the right.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate systemic arterial hypertension (SBP 174 mm Hg).
The left ventricular filling pressure was moderately elevated (LVEDP 23 mm Hg).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Intra-op Echo [**2134-6-14**] PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The patient remained on the medicine service for preoperative Plavix washout.
