[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
An eccentric, anterior directed jet of The effective regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2 The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm.
Due to poor echo windows an LVOT gradient was not obtained.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-1-6**], the mitral valve has been repaired; trace mitral regurgitation is present.
COMPARISON: [**2178-1-7**] at 6:15 p.m., approximately 11 hours prior to the current study.
DL The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
