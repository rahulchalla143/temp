Radiology: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2103-11-30**] 12:48 PM FINDINGS: Single portable AP view of the chest was obtained.
There is mild prominence of the right hilum which could relate to underlying vasculature, however, recommend further evaluation with dedicated PA and lateral views.
Mild prominence of the right hilum for which further evaluation with dedicated PA and lateral views is recommended.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2103-12-1**] 11:46 AM AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to [**11-30**], [**2103**].
Left lower lobe consolidation has progressed since the prior study and might reflect developing infection, worsening atelectasis or aspiration.
CT/CTA BRAIN WITH PERFUSION / CTA NECK Study Date of [**2103-12-1**] 8:59 PM FINDINGS:  On the unenhanced head CT, there is no evidence for acute ischemia.
Evaluation of the CTA of the neck demonstrates mild atheromatous irregularity of the right common and proximal ICA but without significant stenosis.
CTA images through the brain demonstrate no evidence for high-grade stenosis, or vascular occlusion.
Atherosclerotic disease in the bilateral carotid bifurcations and proximal ICAs, left greater than right but which does not appear to be more than 50%.
Thyroid lesions which could represent goiter but consider further evaluation with ultrasound if not already performed.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2103-12-3**] 9:48 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-30**] through 8:  Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved, but small bilateral pleural effusions have increased.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2103-12-4**] 10:42 AM FINDINGS: There has been a slight improvement in bibasilar lung aeration as well as mild pulmonary edema.

Her exam was initially notable for left proximal arm weakness and complete left leg plegia.
CTA (it was not possible to perform MRI scanning due to the presence of her pacemaker) revealed a stenotic right ACA and no clear acute infarction.
She developed orthopnoea and dyspnea on exertion and CXR revealed bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema likely due to her aggressive IV fluid resuscitation to maintain her BP.
She remained stable and was discharged home with services for cardiovascular monitoring on [**2103-12-5**].
Initial examination revealed left proximal arm weakness and complete L leg plegia and notably this improved somewhat with elevation of her BP.
CT head revealed no evidence for acute ischemia, hemorrhage, midline shift or mass effect.
CTA head showed mild irregularity and narrowing of the ACA branches particularly on the right felt likely due to atherosclerosis in addition to no other evidence for high-grade stenosis or vascular occlusion.
CT perfusion revealed decreased perfusion in the right ACA territory.
CTA neck showed atherosclerotic disease in the bilateral carotid bifurcations and proximal ICAs, left greater than right but which does not appear to be more than 50% in addition to mild plaque at the origin of the right vertebral artery which causes mild stenosis and the left vertebral artery was noted to be markedly hypoplastic with poor flow proximally which was felt could be related to high-grade stenosis or hypoplasia.
Phenylephrine drip was weaned off on [**2103-12-2**] and she was maintained on IVF with a goal SBP 140-150.
However she began to complain of shortness of breath when lying flat, and a CXR showed pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
On advice of cardiology and out of concern for dropping her BP and causing hypoperfusion symptoms, she received no further diuretics.
She remained on close BP monitoring with goal SBP 140-150.
She was followed by cardiology and had a pacemaker interrogation on [**2103-12-2**] which showed normal function and although she had episodes of paced tachycardia in the 100s and per cardiology this tachycardia represented pacing from SA node.
She was monitored on telemetry and this showed a paced rhythm throughout.
Pre-op TTE on [**2103-11-30**] showed normal systolic function with no evidence of cardioembolic source and this was not repeated.
Lipid panel revealed total chol 166, LDL 82, TG 74, HDL 69.
She remained stable on transfer to the floor with a good BP and non-focal examination throughout the rest of her stay.
Although she was initially symptomatic as a result of her bilateral pleural effusions with orthopnoea and dyspnoea on exertion, this improved and repeat CXRs showed better aeration but still moderate pleural effusions.
We stopped lorazepam on discharge out of concern for possible hypotension.
She remained stable and was discharged home with services for cardiovascular monitoring on [**2103-12-5**].
She was advised that if she had any further weakness on the left side, she should return to the ED and in the interim should try and lie flat to improve blood pressure.
Repeat CXR showed pulmonary edema and bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
Echo was not repeated as recent pre-op echo on [**2103-11-30**] demonstrated normal systolic function.
UA was equivocal and UCx revealed no growth.
# PULM: CXR on [**2103-12-2**] showed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.
On transfer to the floor she was initially symptomatic as above with orthopnoea and dyspnoea on exertion, this improved and repeat CXRs showed better aeration but still moderate pleural effusions.
Patient has a history of hypothyroidism and note incidental finding on CT of apparent goiterous changes in bilateral thyroid lobes.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed.
Medications on Admission: - metronidazole 500mg [**Hospital1 **] (Rx'd for pelvic/abdominal pain) - levothyroxine 25mcg QD - ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] - fluoxetine 40mg QD - lisinopril 5mg QD (just discharged on this as a new med) - augmentin 500mg TID x14 days (just discharged on this as a new med for R hand cellulitis from a dog bite)  Discharge Medications: 1. amoxicillin-pot clavulanate 500-125 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) for 10 days: started [**2103-12-1**] for 14 day course to finish [**2103-12-14**].
You were initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for medicines to increase your blood pressure.
Imaging of the blood vessels of your head revealed a narrowing in the corresponding artery which supplie this area called the anterior cerebral artery.
Your weakness improved greatly after being started on medications to increase your blood pressure.
