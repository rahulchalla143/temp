IMAGING [**7-3**] Head CT: No acute intracranial process .
[**7-3**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: 1.
[**7-6**] MRI Head: Punctate area of slow diffusion in right medial temporal lobe medial to the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle.
Saline contrast study was technically suboptimal for exclusion of patent foramen ovale.
If clinical suspicion of a PFO is high, consider a transesophageal study or transcranial Dopplers .
[**7-7**] CTA Head/Neck 1.
Head CT shows no evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates no vascular occlusion or stenosis.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion, stenosis or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size.
The patient underwent lumbar puncture, that was negative.
Serum and urine tox were negative.
Patient had no signs of cirrhosis on abdominal CT, and ammonia level is 17.
He underwent EEG that showed no evidence of seizure.
He also underwent brain MRI which showed a small area of ischemia in the temporal lobe, though this did not seem to completely explain his initial presentation so medication effect still thought to be the primary explanation for patient's altered mental status.
Echo and CTA of Head and Neck were negative.
Stroke w/u showed only mildly elevated triglycerides and LDL, but no other risk factors.
Will need repeat MRI brain in 8/[**2112**].
Blood cultures returned negative.
Urine culture returned negative.
ED lumbar puncture showed no evidence of infection.
The patient underwent repeat CXR that showed mild edema.
In the MICU, antibiotics were held and patient was monitored for further signs of pneumonia.
On the floor, pt's WBC count remained stable and he was afebrile.
# [**Last Name (un) **] - Patient was admitted with Cr 1.4 (baseline 1.1).
Patient's creatinine subsequently improved, though was 1.2-1.4 at time of discharge.
His initial seroquel level was still pending at the time of discharge.
Hepatitis C studies pending at the time of discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Patient's seroquel level pending at the time of discharge and needs to be followed up as possible explanations of his mental status - Patient will need education about the importance of taking his medications regularly and only as prescribed - Pt should follow-up with neurology in one month with a follow-up MRI to evaluate her ischemic lesion - Patient will need monitoring of LFTs and renal function as outpatient  Medications on Admission: seroquel 50mg QHS simvastatin 20mg daily allopurinol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] vit D 1000u omeprazole 20mg daily colchicine 0.6mg prn Vitamin B12 250mg   Discharge Medications: 1.
Outpatient Radiology Pt needs a repeat MRI brain to evaluate his possible ischemic lesion seen on MRI in [**7-/2113**] 2.
**  While you were here, you had an MRI of your brain which showed an area concerning for a stroke.
You will need a repeat MRI in [**Month (only) 216**] for further evaluation.
We also noted that some of your liver enzymes were elevated.
