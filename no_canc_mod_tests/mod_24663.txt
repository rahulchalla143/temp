Her work-up was remarkable for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and the finding of a large thoracic aortic aneurysm.
She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4469**] who peformed an echocardiogram which showed the aorta to measure 6.9cm at the root, 6.3cm at the arch to 4.1cm in the descending thoracic aorta.
Subsequently cardiac catheterization was done to reveal triple vessel disease.
