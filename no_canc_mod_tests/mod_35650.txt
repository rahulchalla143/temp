Her fundal checks were firm, however, she sat up prior to being discharged from the labor and delivery unit, felt a bit of warm blood.
However, upon further evaluation it was clear that she was sitting in a puddle of close to almost 2 liters of blood.
She was laid down and there was a quick bimanual exam which was consistent with the uterus being full of clots which were evacuated.
She tolerated the exam well, however, given the large amount of blood and low blood pressure and her heart rate being in the 140s, the resource nurse, anesthesia and OB hemorrhage protocol was called.
Better IV access was obtained and she was brought to the operating room while 2 units of emergency blood release were being given while products were being made available.
In the meantime, ongoing evaluation was performed and it was felt that this was due to atony.
Pt was transfused 3U PRBC for blood loss, 2U FFP for fibrinogen of 142, and Hemabate, Cytotec, Pitocin for uterine atony.
While in the ICU pt required lasix for pulmonary edema with good response by urine output.
On [**12-22**], pt's O2 saturation dropped to 91% on RA.
She underwent CTA which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism but mild fluid overload and bibasilar atelectasis.
