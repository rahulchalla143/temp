Her O2 sats at the LTC facility were 92% on 2L.
On arrival to the ED her initial vital signs were temp 98.4 and heart rate of 79 blood pressure of 89/33 respiratory rate of 22 and O2 sats of 74% on room air (and then 92% on 4L O2).
A chest x-ray showed an ill-defined retrocardiac opacity which could reflect aspiration or infection with a small left pleural effusion.
Her vital signs at the time of transfer were HR 66 RR 27 BP 109/43 with O2 sats of 96% on a non-rebreather.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure or palpitations.

She was presented with a CXR showing a left pleural/parapneumonic effusion that quickly worsened to complete white-out of this lung, likely secondary to a post-obstructive pneumonic process.
She was covered for HCAP with Vancomycin and Zosyn, extended past the typical 8-day coverage due to the severity of her pneumonia and extremely high O2 requirement of 6L NC and high-flow O2 through the mask.
Given the refractoriness of her disease, an awake bronchoscopy was performed to look for any acute, reversible conditions (i.e.
Follow-up CXRs showed progression of her disease bilaterally and her O2 saturations dropped into the 70s.
Information was obtained from webOMR LTC records.
