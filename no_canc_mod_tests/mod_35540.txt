She went back to her PCP who drew labs notable for INR 8, Hct 16, and Cr 3.5 (unclear baseline, but closer to normal).
Patient was advised to come to the ED for evaluation, where initial vs were: T 97.9, HR 85, BP 179/81, RR 16, O2 sat 99% RA.
Labs were notable for WBC 15, Hct 15, Plt nml.
INR was 24.
Cr was 3.7, foley with good UOP, LFT's okay, CXR nml, FAST scan negative.
CT abdomen showed no retroperitoneal bleed.
When her hematocrit remained stable, she was transferred to the floors.

Brief Hospital Course: A 63 year-old woman with history of HTN/ESRD s/p LRRT [**2147**] presented [**4-5**] with supratherapeutic INR to 24 and hct 15 (admitted overnight to MICU [**4-5**]-->[**4-6**]), now s/p FFP and vitamin K with INR 1.3 and s/p 6U PRBCs with hct 21 and stable.
Her drop in hematocrit (from baseline mid 30s per OSH records) was felt to be due to extensive subcutaneous ecchymoses and GI losses in the setting of an INR >24 on presentation.
Because her hematocrit stabilized once her INR corrected, we felt that inpatient colonoscopy was not necessary.
Her CBC could be followed up as outpatient, and stool guiaics repeated if her hematocrit does not return to baseline.
At time of discharge, her hematocrit was 27-->28 without any additional transfusions.
Her INR was 1.3. .
She received FFP and vitamin K and her INR came down to 1.3.
However, patient believed her baseline creatinine to be 1.8.
At presentation her creatinine was 3.7.
This came down to 2.2 after the blood transfusions.
Her leukocytosis resolved on the first hospital day.
X-rays of her right ankle were negative for osteomyelitis.
We held her outpatient antihypertensives initially in the setting of possible bleed.
When it was clear that her hematocrit was stable and that she was not actively bleeding, metoprolol and Lasix were restarted.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses Supratherapeutic INR Anemia from blood loss Acute on chronic renal failure .
Hematocrit stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized because your INR was supratherapeutic and there was concern of bleeding risk.
At the time of discharge, the hematocrit is 27 and stable.
