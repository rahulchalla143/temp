At about 10:30am, she had a bowel movement with frank blood mixed with black blood insetting of an INR of 4.3.
She had a previous colonscopy during which a benign polyp was removed but had never been diagnosed w/ulcers.
In the ED, her vitals were T 96.3, HR 82, BP 112/73, RR 16, saturation 97% RA and was in atrial fibrillation.
She recieved aspirin, vitamin K 5mg iv, vitamin K 5mg po, and a pantoprazole gtt was initiated.
An NG lavage returned 200cc of pink to red fluid with occassional clots and received ~500cc of NS with the protonix drip in the ED.
While these were likely to have recently bled, it was felt unlikely that these were the cause of such a dramatic HCT drop so colonoscopy was persued.
Pt received 4 units of pRBC and HCT improved to 32.7.

**FINAL REPORT [**2106-5-29**]**    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2106-5-29**]):       Culture workup discontinued.
Further incubation showed contamination       with mixed skin/genital flora.
Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available on request.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2106-5-26**] 8:08 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-14**], there is little overall change.
Erythema, congestion and friability in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Ulcers seen in the stomach, likely with recent bleeding.
- repeat EGD in [**6-2**] weeks - check HP serologies and treat if positive - cont to hold coumadin - d/w cards re need for this medication - clear diet OK today  Assuming plans to call out of ICU today, anticipate [**Last Name (un) **] tomorrow: - MOVIprep this afternoon - strict NPO after 2AM (inlc no prep) w plan for [**Last Name (un) **] in AM  COLONOSCOPY [**2106-5-28**] Findings:  Protruding Lesions Medium internal hemorrhoids with stigmata of recent bleeding were noted.
She was found to have an INR of 4.3.
Received 4 units PRBCs and 3 units of FFP for stabalization of hematocrit in the low 30's.
Before leaving the floor, had large maroon colored stool with blood clots which was beleived to be old and b/c of prep.
HCT remained stable in the 30s w/out any significant drop.
Coloscopy was performed which showed hemorrhoids w/signs of recent bleeding.
Will need heparin bridge after procedure to be placed back on coumadin but at a lower dose w/close follow-up of INR on [**Date Range 766**] of next week.
Calcium 600 + D(3) 600 mg(1,500mg) -200 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.

However, while in the ED you had a large bloody bowel movement and your INR was found to be 4.0 (elevated above the therapeutic range).
An endoscopy was performed which showed an ulcer which may have bled, and your colonoscopy showed internal hemorrhoids which also showed signs of recent bleeing (likely due to the elevated INR).
You continued to improve and your red blood cell count remained stable without signs of bleeding.
You will also need to see the gastroenterologist in [**6-2**] weeks for repeat endoscopy to ensure that your ulcer has resolved.
Please go to your usual coumadin clinic to have your INR checked on [**Date Range 766**] [**2106-5-31**].
