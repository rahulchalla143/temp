Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ([**2163-9-30**]) MERCI retrieval and thrombolysis of clot in left M1 and M2 vessels.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 65 year old right handed man with a past medical history significant for a.fib (not on Coumadin - has been undergoing cardioversion and ablations, and has been off for at least a month, HTN, HLD, DM - on insulin and oral medications, who presents with a sudden onset of right sided weakness, determined to have a LMCA syndrome at an OSH, given tPA and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
He had a CTA which showed a persistent L MCA clot and he was taken to the angio suite for intervention.
NIH Stroke Scale score was 19: 1a.
Sensory: 2 9.
Language: 3 10.
Dysarthria: 1 11.
I was present during the CT scanning and reviewed the images instantly within 20 minutes of their completion.
On neuro ROS and general ROS was not available at the time.

Discharge Labs: [**2163-10-17**]: CBC: 10.7/11.4/32/580 PT 22  PTT 27.2  INR 2.0 Chem 10: 139/4.4/103/27/15/0.8/162 Ca 8.2 Phos 3.8 Mg 2.0 .
ECG [**2163-9-30**]: Normal sinus rhythm.
TRANS CATH INFUSION [**2163-9-30**]: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 90711**] underwent cerebral angiography and mechanical and chemical thrombolysis of the left middle cerebral artery and its branches which were successful.
PORTABLE CXR [**2163-9-30**]: The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carina.
EEG [**2163-10-3**]: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
ECHO [**2163-10-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Agitated saline contrast study at rest revealed no evidence of intracardiac shunt (though technically suboptimal).
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2163-10-4**]: There has been no appreciable change.
Repeat CT at [**Hospital3 **] revealed: .
His last CT scan on [**2163-10-4**] showed the presence of a large volume MCA stroke with hemorrhagic conversion as well as intraventricular hemorrhage.
The CT on [**2163-10-4**] did not show any signs of local vasogenic edema concerning enough to start on osmotic therapy.
CXR revealed right pleural effusions and lower lobe opacity consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
As patient was transferred from ICU to general floor, he was placed on a VAP antibiotic bundle (vancomycin, tobramycin, cefepime) which helped reduce his fevers and leukocytosis and resulted in clearing of the CXR over the course of 3 days.
A cardiac enzyme assay returned negative.
*)ENDO: Diabetes medications were held and patient was placed on insulin sliding scale for better control of blood sugars per stroke protocol.
His blood sugar control has been complicated during this hospital admission with blood glucose values ranging from 150-300.
*) ABDOMEN: Patient suffered a pneumoperitoneum, thought to be secondary to placement of PEG tube.
On day of discharge, his INR was 2.0 on the aspirin bridge to Coumadin.
We have continued him on both aspirin and Coumadin and his INR will need to be rechecked, the aspirin can be discontinued once his INR is stable between [**2-24**].
