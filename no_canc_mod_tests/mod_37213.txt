His PAP was 42/29 with a wedge of 12, SVR 1111.
Postoperative hematocrit was 37.2, white count 9.6, BUN 27, creatinine 1.3, potassium 4.1.
Nitroglycerin IV was continued to maintain systolic blood pressure in the 100-150 range.
Electrocardiogram was without ischemic changes.
His cardiac index was diminished but responded to volume repletion.
Total CK was 1700, MB 0, and troponin levels negative.
Hematocrit remained stable at 37.9.
Total CK was 1699, 98, MB was 30, MBI index was 1.8, and troponin level was 0.3.
Chest x-ray was without failure.
Abdominal exam was soft, nontender, with no erythema.
The patient's hematocrit drifted to 31.3.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion with increased vascular congestion and no infiltrates.
Total CKs continued to remain elevated, although MBs were 74 and 80 respectively, and indexes were 0.9 and 1.2.
Troponin levels continued to remain less than 0.3.
The patient underwent MRI of his spine because of the onset of neurological symptoms of right proximal muscle weakness and diminished deep tendon reflexes.
The patient's CK continued to be elevated, and troponin level was 14.0 on postoperative day #3.
Troponin levels over the next 48-72 hours showed definite decline.
The patient's platelet count improved after discontinuation of the Heparin.
Creatinine remained stable at 2.2.
Postoperative chest x-ray was without pneumothorax.
Sputum cultures were sent which grew ..............., moderate, and .................... which were pansensitive.
Others obtained the same time included urine culture, blood cultures, which were no growth, and CD tip culture which grew greater than 15 colonies of Enterococcus resistant to Levofloxacin, sensitive to Ampicillin, Penicillin, and Vancomycin.
There were chest x-ray findings consistent with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis versus aspiration.
The patient developed some abdominal distention and nausea, and a KUB was obtained which showed an ileus.
