Stool was sent for C. difficile, still pending at discharge but low suspicion.
Her diarrhea resolved, as well as her leukocytosis (WBC 11-->6.6) and thrombocytosis (platelet 610s -->477).
Please reintroduce her oral hypoglycemics gradually as an out-patient (at rehab) with close monitoring of her blood sugars.
Please consider a repeat echo in approximately 2 weeks as an out-patient to reassess LV function.
