Head CT was negative for a mass or bleed.
CAD, status post cardiac catheterization in [**2145-7-15**] with PTCA and stent of the LCX.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.5, pulse 73, blood pressure 140/50, respiratory rate 12, 02 saturation 100% on room air.
HEENT examination revealed that the pupils were minimally reactive, anicteric, significant facial/periorbital edema, ET tube in place.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Deep tendon reflexes could not be elicited.
Positive Babinski bilaterally, positive corneal reflex and gag reflex, normal muscle tone.
LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER: White count 4.2, hematocrit 26.7, platelets 333,000.
Sodium 139, potassium 6.0, chloride 96, bicarbonate 27, BUN 83, creatinine 8.4, glucose 41.
PT 21, PTT 57, INR 2.8, ALT 6, AST 17, CK 57, troponin less than 0.3, alkaline phosphatase 108, total bilirubin 0.2.
ABGs 7.59/30/519, lactate 2.4.
The head CT was negative for bleed.
The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, new T wave inversions in V4 through V6, no peak Ts, no ST elevations or depressions, no Q waves.
During this episode, trembling, the patient was noted to have a fingerstick of 36.
His head CT was negative, and his MRI was negative for bleed but showed only old bilateral lacunar disease.
No lumbar puncture was performed because of a low index of suspicion for infectious sources of mental status changes.
At this time, there still is an EEG pending from [**Hospital3 16786**] from which he was transferred.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient has known right and left-sided upper extremity clots, and as of [**2145-11-3**], had 40% occlusion of the SVC.
As already noted, the patient is scheduled for an AV fistulogram on [**2145-11-29**].
All of the patient's blood cultures have been negative.
His chest x-ray initially indicated the presence of opacity, but the final read was read as atelectasis.
However, once the chest x-ray was confirmed, this combination was stopped.
However, because the patient is such an access issue, there was a decision to treat through this infection as long as the blood cultures remained negative.
The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2145-11-25**], which showed an EF of 60-70%, bidirectional stent, ASD, normal free wall motion, and mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
