ABG 6.9/17/60 HCO3 5.
EKG showed changes that were initially concerning for STEMI and pt started on heparin gtt because of this.
Cardiology reportedly saw pt & reviewed EKG in ED and felt that pt was not having ACS and that heparin was not indicated.

ECHO:  EF > 75%.
Resting EKG is notable for chronic anteroseptal Q waves and left ventricular hypertrophy with STT wave abnormalities affecting the inferior leads and V4-V6.
EKG during stress demonstrated frequent VPB's.
Blood pressure was hypertensive reaching 220/100 at peak exercise.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 65%.
Infectious etiologies also considered as cause of DKA although her CXR, UA, blood cultures and LP were all negative.
The pt may have had cardiac event in the setting of DKA; however, it is not thought that her DKA was triggered by ACS.
Her enzymes were elevated: troponin to 0.13 and CK index positive.
On further review, her EKG changes were interpreted as J-point elevations (not ST elevations) and were noted to be old.
Her enzymes peaked at a troponin of 0.13, CK of 502 and CK index of 5.4.
Given that she was >24 hours out from the event, catheterization was not undertaken.
Rather, the pt underwent a stress MIBI, which showed normal myocardial perfusion study and calculated LVEF of 65%.
# HTN - metoprolol and lisinopril were titrated for BP & HR control.
