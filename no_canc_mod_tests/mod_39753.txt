His blood sugars at [**Hospital3 **] were ~500 and he was started on an insulin drip.
Cardiac catheterization was achieved using a right radial approach.
Coronary angiography showed 100% occlusion in the RCA, 40% occlusion in the left main, and a clean circumflex.
He noticed that his blood sugars were high over the last few days but otherwise no recent change in his health.
Physical Exam: Admission Exam VS: T=98.5 BP= 154/89 HR= 85 RR= 18 O2 sat= 98% Wt 63kg Ht 165cm (5'5") GENERAL: NAD.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 5 cm.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Discharge Exam On day of discharge, BP was elevated (SBP 150s-170s/80s-90s), HR 60s.
Cardiac exam showed RRR, no m/r/g, lungs clear.

Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate to severe systemic arterial hypertension (184/89mmHg).
TTE ([**2137-9-9**]): LVEF = 50.
Cardiac cath showed 100% RCA occlusion 40% left main, clean circ.
Following cath junctional rhythm on arrival to the CCU which converted to sinus.
Given multi vessel disease patient will need stress test in 1 week to assess 40% left main disease for possible cardiac surgery.
# ?Infiltrative cardiomyopathy: Patient's [**2137-9-9**] TEE showed echogenic texture with ground glass appearance, concerning for possible infiltrative cardiomyopathy.
Patient was scheduled for outpatient cardiac MRI to further evaluate.
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine 1.3 on admission.
He was initially started on insulin gtt for blood sugars in the 500s.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Pt started on high dose atorvastatin 80mg PO daily  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization - HbA1c 12% on admission, pt will likely need to start insulin regimen at home - Medication changes:    - Atenolol and amlodipine were stopped    - Lisinopril decreased from 60mg daily to 40mg daily    - HCTZ held during hospitalization, pt asked to resume after discharge    - Simvastatin changed to atorvastatin 80mg daily    - Started carvedilol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **], ASA 325mg daily, Prasugrel 10mg daily - F/u SPEP and UPEP (results pending at discharge) - F/u stress echo on [**2137-9-17**] to assess left main vessel disease - F/u cardiac MRI on [**2137-10-10**] for question of infiltrative myopathy  Medications on Admission: Atenolol 50mg daily Lisinopril 60mg daily Metformin 500mg daily (no longer on glyburide) Amlodipine 10mg daily Simvastatin 40mg daily K-Dur 20mEq twice daily Hydrochlorothiazide 50mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

While you were in the hospital, your blood sugars were controlled with insulin.
You will need to have a stress test in one week, which has already been ordered.
You will also need an MRI scan of the heart before your appointment with your cardiologst,  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], on [**10-10**].
