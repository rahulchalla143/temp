CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 6265**] for cardiac catheterization.
He was seen in consultation at his pulmonologist's office on [**2137-4-30**] for evaluation of a cough for a 4-month duration.
On evaluation in the Pulmonary Clinic he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and felt to be in congestive heart failure and transferred to [**Hospital3 3583**] for admission.
At [**Hospital3 3583**], the patient was noted to be normotensive with a blood pressure of 105/65, heart rate of 100 with ventricular ectopy, and a respiratory rate of 22 with unlabored breathing.
His electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia with ectopy, reactive airway disease, poor R wave progression, and with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
Clinically, he was felt to be in congestive heart failure and volume overloaded and was admitted for management of his congestive heart failure and a viral pneumonia.
In the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the patient had the following findings:  An arterial blood gas of 7.4, PCO2 of 48, and a PO2 of 67, atrial pressure was noted to be 14, right ventricle 61/8, cardiac output of 3.22, cardiac index of 1.58, pulmonary artery pressure of 60/34, with a mean of 45, and a wedge of 39 to 40.
Findings from angiography included both grafts with 100% occlusions, 100% right coronary artery occlusion, 100% left anterior descending artery occlusion, a 98% left circumflex lesion, left subclavian 100% lesion, perfusion maintained through collaterals, and a left ventriculography was not performed.
His immediate pre-intubation arterial blood gas had deteriorated to 7.22, with a PCO2 of 64, and a PO2 of 149.
His blood pressure continued to drop, especially after intubation with the use of propofol with his nadir at 37 for approximately five minutes.
The patient was re-shocked at 360 joules and eventually converted to normal sinus rhythm with improvement of his blood pressure.
His first complete hemodynamic numbers since arriving in the Coronary Care Unit were notable for a pulmonary artery pressure of 78/33, a cardiac output of 3.4, cardiac index of 1.61.
These numbers further deteriorated to a central venous pressure of 23, pulmonary artery pressure of 73/39, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 40, a cardiac output of 2.6, a cardiac index of 1.28, systemic vascular resistance of 1600 (consistent with cardiogenic shock).
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications as an outpatient included)  1.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on arrival to the Coronary Care Unit revealed weight of 88 kg, blood pressure of 89/62 (on 40 mcg of nitroglycerin), heart rate of 105 (with intermittent sinus tachycardia), respiratory rate of 24 to 26, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on face mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Jugular venous pulse approximately 9 cm to 10 cm.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION: Laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count of 13, hematocrit of 43.4, platelets of 245.
PT of 16.2, PTT of 31.2, INR of 1.8.
Sodium of 136, potassium of 4.6, chloride of 96, bicarbonate of 33, blood urea nitrogen of 25, creatinine of 0.6, blood sugar of 64.
Creatine kinase of 133, with a MB of 4.
Albumin of 3.4, calcium of 8.3, phosphorous of 4.1, magnesium of 1.7.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Cardiac catheterization with the following findings:  A right-dominant system revealing 3-vessel coronary artery disease; the left main coronary artery was normal, the left anterior descending artery was subtotally occluded after a large first diagonal, the left circumflex was subtotally occluded proximally with late filling of a large first obtuse marginal which collateralized at the posterior descending artery, the right coronary artery was occluded proximally, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery was occluded, and the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery could not be engaged because the left subclavian artery was occluded 3 cm distal to its origin, but seemed to be filling the distal left anterior descending artery via competitive flow on the native vessel.
CARDIOVASCULAR:   (a) Ischemia:  The patient had cardiac enzymes cycled with a peak creatine kinase of 378, with a MB fraction within the normal range.
The patient's Swan numbers were monitored closely, and with noted improvement the patient's vasopressin drip was discontinued on hospital day two.
An echocardiogram obtained on [**2137-5-2**] showed the left ventricular cavity to be dilated, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, right ventricular systolic function also appeared depressed, and ejection fraction was noted to be between 10% and 20%.
In addition, blood cultures were notable for coagulase negative Staphylococcus in the anaerobic bottle.
The patient was noted to have a low-grade temperature and spiked to a temperature of 101.1 on hospital day three.
INR was noted to be 2.3 on hospital day four on no anticoagulation.
