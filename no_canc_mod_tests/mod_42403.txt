PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, physical examination showed currently stable vital signs although he had had a transient increase in his systolic blood pressure to 210 with a decreased heart rate into the 40s.
Upper extremity strength was [**4-29**] and lower extremity strength was [**4-29**] bilaterally.
Head CT done at Tuft [**Hospital 4415**] demonstrated a subarachnoid hemorrhoid consistent with blood throughout the basal cisterns, large amount spreading along the left tentorial edge.
Blood was also present in the third and fourth ventricle on the right lateral ventricle.
The angiogram was negative for any evidence of cerebral aneurysm or cerebral basal dissection.
Following the angiogram, the patient was transferred in stable condition to the Intensive Care Unit for q1hour neurologic checks and started on Amlodipine 60 mg p.o.
His blood pressure was maintained on Nitroprusside drip and kept less than 150 at all times.
On [**2198-12-4**], with the patient's neurologic examination stable in the Intensive Care Unit, it was decided at that point to transfer the patient to the floor.
On [**2198-12-7**], it was decided to repeat the patient's angiogram to again examine the patient's cerebral circulation for evidence of aneurysm.
He underwent angiogram on [**2198-12-7**], which again was negative for cerebral aneurysm.
Following this angiogram on the night of [**2198-12-7**], to [**2198-12-8**], the patient complained of significant increase in his headache.
Neurologic examination at that time demonstrated the patient was alert and oriented with reactive pupils, no drift, with normal lower extremity strength, no evidence of groin hematoma.
Neurologic examination was still intact.
The CT demonstrated a small amount of residual subarachnoid blood along the tentorium.
Grade I subarachnoid hemorrhage, status post cerebral angiogram times two negative for any evidence of intracerebral aneurysm.
