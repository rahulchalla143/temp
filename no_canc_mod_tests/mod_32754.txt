CT head/ neck w and w/o contrast 1.
Procedure note- [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 82957**] underwent cerebral angiography and emergent stenting and angioplasty of his left internal carotid artery and mechanical thrombectomy of the left middle cerebral artery without any complications.
The MRA of the head demonstrates vascular flow in both internal carotids as well as the vertebrobasilar system, apparently the left medial cerebral artery is patent including the M1 and M2 segments, no evidence of flow stenotic lesions are identified in the posterior circulation or right internal carotid artery.
No thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest (patient unable to cooperate with maneuvers).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
He underwent CTA and emergent stenting of [**Doctor First Name 3098**] and MERCI procedure for clot removal by neurosurgery team.
He underwent OT/PT/speech eval and was transfered to rehab facility for further care.
Please continue with Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, sliding scale of insulin depending on his blood sugars.
