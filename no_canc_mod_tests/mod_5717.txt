The patient was then found to be stable with blood pressures in the 120s/70s.
Oxygen saturations were 100% on a nonrebreather face mask.

The patient's baseline creatinine ran between 0.7 and 0.8.
He also had a glucose of 496.

The sputum Gram stain showed 4+ Gram-negative rods, 2+ yeast, and the arterial blood gas on admission showed a pH of 7.1, CO2 of 38, oxygen saturation 159 on 15 liters nonrebreather face mask 60%.
Chest x-ray, compared to an AP of [**2184-6-21**], showed no cardiomegaly or effusions, lungs fields grossly clear, no cephalization, and a feeding tube in her abdomen.
EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia only.
Chest x-ray remained clear throughout the hospitalization with no evidence of aspiration pneumonia.
Although the patient had Gram-negative rods on sputum Gram stain the cultures were negative at the time of discharge.
In addition, 1 out 4 bottles of blood cultures grew Gram-positive cocci, which was not yet speciated.
Sputum Gram stain showed 4+ Gram-negative rods, 2+ yeasts and 4+ oral flora.
Urine cultures grew multiple Gram-negative rods consistent with fecal contamination.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was admitted with blood sugar of close to 500 and urine sugars greater than 1000.
Colonization of sputum and urine with multiple Gram-negative organisms.
The patient has speciation of 1 out of 4 positive cultures from [**Hospital1 69**] pending.
Right upper extremity ultrasound is being performed on the day of discharge and the results will be Emailed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
