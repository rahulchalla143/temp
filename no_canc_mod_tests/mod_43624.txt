The patient had various other issues including a fleeting transaminitis that was evaluated by ultrasound,  normocytic anemia with a hematocrit of 33.
The patient's baseline was unclear, though in [**2098-10-20**] he had a HCT of 40.
Iron studies were deemed consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
His pulse was 40-48, his BP was 115/55.
EKG showed Sinus bradycardia with increased 1st degree AV delay compared with prior EKG .
After word of a K of 6.3-6.8.
A renal ultrasound showed improved hydro.
Renal insufficiency - unsure of the baseline is ?was 2.0 on dc- if the cause was obstructive uropathy- would have progressed further 6.
BPH 8.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2099-12-8**], except for the change in rate and atrial premature beats, no diagnostic interval change.

Hyperkalemia was successfully treated with Ca gluconate, Insulin/dextrose, Kayexalate and furosemide and he had no further episodes of this and potassium remained in the normal range to discharge.
Bradycardia was felt to be secondary to atenolol toxicity and atenolol was held and his bradycardia improved to the 60s by discharge.
ECG showed sinus bradycardia and this was felt to be atenolol toxicity and not due to hyperkalemia.
His initial ECGs showed appearances which appeared to alternate between what was thought to be a slow AF to what resembled a Mobitz 2 with 2:1 block and was latterly seen to be Sinus rhythm with bigeminal PACs and first degree AV block, PR interval= 230 ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] had a negative MI workup with negative cardiac enzymes x3.
Electrophysiology were consulted for further evaluation of persistent bradycardia to the 50s after discontinuation of atenolol.
Barring any further progression of his underlying nodal dysfunction, it is likely that the patient will return to his baseline once the atenolol effect has fully cleared and indeed by the day of discharge, his heart rate was increasing to the 60s.
Creatinien was 3.3 on anmission and had hyperkalemia as described above with a K 6.8.
A renal ultrasound was performed on [**10-20**] showed interval improvement in left sided hydronephrosis and nonobstructing renal calculi and renal cysts in the right kidney were unchanged from prior studies.
FeNa was 7.2% and uninformative.
His medications were renally dosed and his creatinine improved following treatment of teh hyperkalemis and stoping atenolol.
His creatinine on discharge was 2.3.
Initial considerations included BPPV although abrupt head turning demonstrated no nystagmus and did not bring on symptoms.
Albumin was 2.6 on admission and improved to 3.4.
# Coronary artery disease: Mr [**Known lastname **] had episodes of chest pain on admission which was felt to be likely due to his bradycardia and he was ruled out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes x3.
TSH was 1.1.

You had an ultrasound of your kidneys which showed improved distension of your left kidney.
It was felt that your symptoms could be accounted for by toxic levels of your atenolol and this was stopped.
BY [**10-22**] your heart rate had improved and you were reviewed by cardiology regarding you low pulse and they felt that this was due to your atenolol.
