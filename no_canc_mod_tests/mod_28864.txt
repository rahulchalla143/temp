[**2112-10-31**]: CT Head: Similar distribution of the known subarachnoid hemorrhage, but with evidence of interval increase of intraventricular hemorrhagic extension and ventricular dilatation.
[**2112-11-3**]: CT Head: Stable.
[**2112-11-3**]: CT Torso: 1.
Likely additional thrombosis in the right common and external iliac vein, evaluation is limited due to poor venous contrast opacification.
[**2112-11-4**] Cerebral Angiogram: Negative for vasopasm  [**2112-11-7**]: Cerebral Angiogram: Mild vasospasm; Intraarterial Verapamil administered  [**2112-11-11**] CT HEAD IMPRESSION: 1.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2112-11-12**] 4:20 AM IMPRESSION: No definite change.
EEG Study Date of [**2112-11-13**]: No seizures noted   CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2112-11-14**] 3:54 AM IMPRESSION: Overall no significant change except improvement in right basilar atelectasis.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2112-11-14**] 7:43 AM IMPRESSION: 1.

The right peroneal veins were not visualized, so an underlying clot in this region cannot be excluded.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

On [**2112-10-30**] after the initial dilantin load the patient had a focal motor seizure.
The patient had persistent lethargy after 2 hours and STAT head CT demonstrated interval increase in ventricular size.
On [**2112-10-31**] the patient underwent diagnostic cerebral angiogram with coil embolization of anterior communicating artery aneurysm under general anesthesia.
On [**11-4**] his EEG showed R temporal slowing which could be consistent with vasospasm; and on exam the patient was noted to be weaker on the LUE.
He underwent a repeat cerebral angiogram on [**11-4**] which showed no evidence of vasospasm.
CSF was sent for culture on [**11-7**] for fever to 103.
Pt underwent Cerebral angiogram on [**2112-11-8**] for worsening mental status and left leg weakness.
Angiogram showed only mild vasospasm and intra-arterial verapamil was injected to bilateral ICAs and the left vertebral artery.
He received one unit of packed cells for a HCT of 24.
[**11-15**] eve his exam worsened, he exhibited increased respiratory effort and he was intubated and underwent a bronch.
His exam remained stable post- Trach/PEG.
On [**11-23**] his exam was remarkable and a Speech evaluation was ordered for PMV placement.
It was noted that his LFT's had trended up from the 11th to the 24th.
