Intraoperatively patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit for observation as there were concerns that the patient may not be able to maintain her airway due to preoperatively concerns that the thyroid was compressing the airway.
Over the night of her operation she became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure to the 80s and she was started on Dopamine drip this was ultimately thought to be related to hypocalcemia.
She was infused with 250 ml of albumin to which her systolic blood pressure responded and she was successfully weaned off dopamine drip and was extubated on [**2100-8-19**] and on room air.
On [**2100-8-21**] she her oxygen saturation was in the mid 90s on Room air during the morning,and then triggered at noon time for O2 Sat of 85% Room air.
However patient continued to have an O2 Sat 90% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
Therefore a chest xray was done which was negative for pneumonia and chest scan was done and was negative for pulmonary embolism.
She continued to have low grade temperature 99 up to 100.2, an electrocardiogram and continued to be tachycardic, although denied dyspnea or chest pain.
Overnight she was ordered for blood transfusion for a hematocrit of 22 which was stopped due to a rise in temperature from 99.2 to 100.2.
She was expectorating green and brown sputum and a sputum culture was obtained.
A sputum culture and repeat chest Xray PA/Lat was done to rule out pneumonia.
The patient continued to have no dyspnea, no respiratory distress and the oxygen was subsequently weaned to 40% and her O2 sats 92% to 94%room air.
