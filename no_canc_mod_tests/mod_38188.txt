NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging of her brain on [**2178-8-13**].
This magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated areas of signal abnormalities that probably represented subacute infarction.
A magnetic resonance angiography of the cervical vasculature revealed no hemodynamically significant stenoses.
The Cardiology Service was consulted for further workup of her cardiomyopathy.
Cardiac catheterization was pursued, yet this procedure was put on hold given since the patient had undergone a cardiac catheterization on a previous admission.
The results of that cardiac catheterization were consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
