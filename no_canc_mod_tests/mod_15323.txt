Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Pulse examinations were palpable throughout bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2124-3-28**] to the Medical Service and taken for cardiac catheterization which revealed a 50% occlusion of the left main, 80% occlusion of the ostial left anterior descending, 95% occlusion of the left circumflex and 100% occlusion of the mid right coronary artery.
In addition, echocardiogram in [**2124-2-10**] revealed an ejection fraction of 25%, global left ventricular hypokinesis and mild diastolic aortic root, trace aortic regurgitation, 2+ mitral regurgitation and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Cardiac Surgery was consulted on the date of admission for evaluation and treatment via possible coronary artery bypass graft.
At this time, the patient also had ongoing medical problems including renal insufficiency with a creatinine up to 2.0 and iron deficiency anemia.
Between the date of admission and [**2124-4-2**], the patient's chronic renal insufficiency appeared to stabilize with a creatinine approximately between 1.8 and 2.0.
On postoperative day #0 the patient was noted to be in accelerated junctional rhythm, however, when his rate slowed down the patient would commence to enter complete heartblock.
His blood pressure remained labile, sensitive to rate and rhythm changes and was being managed with Levophed GTT.
On postoperative day #1, the patient was on Levophed and Milrinone drips with a pressure in the 1-teens.
The patient converted to a rate of 40s to 50s with Amiodarone bolus and required A pacing to maintain blood pressure and indices.
Creatinine was stable at 1.9 to 2.0.
Of note, as well is that postoperative echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 15 to 20%.
with therapeutic INR of 2.0.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up in [**Hospital 409**] Clinic in two weeks, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5717**] in three to four weeks and also for INR checks, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-1**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the Electrophysiology Clinic in one month and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six weeks.
