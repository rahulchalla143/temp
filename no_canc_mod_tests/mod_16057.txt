An electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with ST elevations in II, III and AVF and depressions in V1 and V2.
On admission, the patient had a pulse of 88 and a blood pressure of 141/76.
Electrocardiogram at that time showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute with ST elevations in II, III and AVF and depressions as stated before, in V1 and V2.
The patient's catheterization revealed a right dominant circulation with a 50% left anterior descending artery lesion, an 80% left circumflex lesion at obtuse marginal one and a right coronary artery lesion that was proximal 100%.
The patient had a wedge pressure of 13 and pulmonary artery pressure of 28/14.
Cardiac index was 3.24.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient had no dyspnea on exertion, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and no palpitations.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 96.6, blood pressure 120/50, pulse 95, respiratory rate 12 and oxygen saturation 96% on two liters nasal cannula.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally.
Extremities:  Right groin with 1 inch x 1 inch hematoma, Dopplerable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses on right and left.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 11.7, hematocrit 41.3, platelet count 264,000, electrolytes within normal limits BUN 16 and creatinine 1.2.
First set of cardiac enzymes showed a CK of 569, MB 88, MB index 15.5 and troponin greater than 50.
His CKs peaked in the 800s before trending downward.
The patient was started on aspirin and Plavix, and a lipid panel was sent, which was pending at the time of discharge.
He had an echocardiogram prior to discharge, with preliminary read showing a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 45%.
Hematology:  The patient had an initial hematocrit of 41.3 with some oozing from his groin site during the course of his stay.
Renal:  Creatinine on admission was 1.2.
With hydration, creatinine returned to 1 and remained stable until discharge.
