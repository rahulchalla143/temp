GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
EF 55%.
His catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed significant 3 vessel disease with a preserved LVEF.
Hemostasis was acheived and he was reclosed.
On POD 3 He was transfused  one unit of PRBC's for a HCT of 22.5.
On POD 5 Mr. [**Known lastname 33179**] had made steady progress in his ability to ambulate however his resting heart rate remained in the 90's for which is lopressor was increased.
His SBP dropped into the mid 90's with ambulation up stairs.
His blood pressure was stable.
