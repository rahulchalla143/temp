PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.9, BP 112/60, pulse 97, respirations 20, 98% on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cell count 11.5, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 263,000, (neutrophils 84.4, lymphocytes 6.7).
Sodium 126, potassium 4.3, chloride 88, bicarbonate 28, BUN 19, creatinine 0.6, glucose 153, CK 29, ALT 50, AST 50, total bilirubin 0.5, alkaline phosphatase 73, LDH 180, albumin 3.8, amylase 47, lipase 57.
The U/A revealed negative nitrates, negative leukocytes.
PULMONARY:  The patient was completely stable from a respiratory standpoint on admission; however, on hospital day number three, had respiratory arrest with an ABG of 7.15/82/33 and chest x-ray significant for asymmetric pulmonary edema with question of aspiration pneumonia.
She was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia and when her sputum culture grew MSSA pneumonia, her vancomycin was stopped and she was continued on levofloxacin for a full course.
The patient remained afebrile throughout her hospitalization with a normal white blood cell count and was maintained on levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia.
She maintained good oxygen saturations on room air once transferred to the floor and was completely stable from a respiratory standpoint.
She had an abdominal CT on the day following her admission which was significant for a dilated common bile duct and was evaluated by the ERCP fellow who consented the patient for ERCP.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was noted during her respiratory arrest and brief stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to have troponins peak to 0.36 with flat CKs and an uninterpretable EKG secondary to left bundle branch block.
Given that she experienced a troponin leak in the context of her hypertensive crisis, it is likely that it represents demand ischemia.
She had an echocardiogram which was significant for normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55-70%.
This was changed to metoprolol and lisinopril with doses titrated to control her blood pressure.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was admitted with difficulty tolerating her tube feeds.
On transfer back to the floor, the patient had a video swallow study which was significant for poor tongue movement with premature spillover of fluids as well as an edematous epiglottis that does not deflect which contributes to aspiration.
with her fingerstick glucoses monitored and noted to be under improved control.
