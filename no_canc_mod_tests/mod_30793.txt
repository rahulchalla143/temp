Baseline SBPs is between 70-90 but his SBP dropped to the mid 60s with an ACEi.
His baseline BP is 80s systolic and he continues on a milrinone infusion at 0.8mcg/kg/min.
Please [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight increases greater than 3lbs as his lasix should be uptitrated if blood pressure allows.
