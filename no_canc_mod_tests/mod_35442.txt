The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND  FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler images of the left and right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained.
[**2128-10-28**]: CT perfusion IMPRESSION: 1.
Perfusion abnormality corresponding to the abnormal portion of both frontal lobes, but, elsewhere, perfusion is normal, and the CTA demonstrates no evidence of vasospasm or flow-limiting stenosis.
On [**11-28**] the R EVD was not-functioning and CT head showed increasing edema.
He also had an angio on [**11-29**] which did not show any vasospasm.
During this time pt was febrile and CSF was sent for culture however pt was found to have LLL PNA which was treated and ID was involved due to gram + cocci in CSF.
On [**12-9**] His exam remained poor with only external rotation of BUE and triple flexion of BLE with noxious.
He was then found to have a L common fem DVT and an IVC filter was placed.
He also had elevated LFTs and abdominal US was negative however an Abd CT was done to confirm these findings.
A CTA of the head was done as well to look for vasospasm On [**12-10**], which was positive.
On [**12-11**] Patients exam has slowly improved, he is opening his eyes and tracking the examiner and following simple commands with his upper extremities, with minimal to no movement of his lower extremities.
His sputum is positive for Coag negative staph.
