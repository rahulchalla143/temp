Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Patient admitted in acute renal failure notable for a BUN of 210 and creatinine 9.9.
He was given emergent hemodialysis for three hours and was given aggressive IV fluid hydration and his urine output started to pick up to peaks of 400 cc an hour.
On the third day of his admission, the Swan was discharged and he was continued to be aggressively rehydrated until his urine output came to more reasonable levels where he was able to keep up with his PO intake.
The patient had an EF of 15%.
His initial wedge was 22 and he was monitored closely during this resuscitation.
He had peaked Ts on first EKG which were then resolved.
He was also given vitamin K to reverse his INR of 14.
His INR did reverse on its own and was felt likely secondary to decreased PO intake.
Stool studies were sent and the results are pending, as of the time of this dictation.
