In the ED, initial labs remarkable for WBC 11.3, Hct 27.8, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 104608**], BUN 88/5.7.
Patient was initially on dopamine for low BP but after propofol was switched to fentanyl/midazolam her BP came up and dopamine was weaned off.
CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis/dyskinesis of the distal LV/apex.The inferior wall is akinetic.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CXR [**2204-6-4**]:  Cardiomegaly, [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] congestion, and bilateral parenchymal opacities most compatible with pulmonary edema.
Tip of the endotracheal tube, with the chin in neutral or elevation is less than 2 cm from the carina and should be withdrawn 2-3 cm to avoid unilateral intubation.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2204-6-7**] Comparison is made with prior study [**6-5**].
A CXR showed pulmonary edema and her BNP was measured at [**Numeric Identifier 104608**].
Patient was started on lasix drip with good urine output and was extubated on [**6-6**].
Renal ultrasound showed progression of high resistance pattern of flow within the transplanted kidney with lack of antegrade diastolic flow in the intrarenal and main renal arteries.
Congestive Heart Failure: A cardiolgy evaluation was performed while she was in the MICU given her history of worsening SOB and fluid overload on admission.
An echocardiogram was performed on this admission which showed overall left ventricular systolic function that is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis/dyskinesis of the distal LV/apex and an akinectic inferior wall.
She is not longer hypervolemic on exam and her SOB has resolved.
Her blood pressures have remained low during this admission sbp's 90s-100s.
She has a close follow up appointment with her Cardiologist where her blood pressures can be reassessed at that time.
Her blood pressures should be re-checked following this admission for re-evaluation of her home HTN medication needs.
