During the previous episode in [**Month (only) **], MRI was performed, which revealed acute pancreatitis, multiple liver cysts, gallstones, bilateral pleural effusions, and a 4-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
The patient did have a peak amylase of 7800 during this time, but the amylase and lipase did return to normal values prior to discharge.
During this more recent episode, a CT scan was performed on [**2154-8-13**], which revealed progression of the previous pancreatitis with a new inflammatory mass, as well as a thick area of pancreatic collection.
The patient did not have any elevations in amylase or lipase at [**Hospital3 **].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: Temperature 98.6, blood pressure 148/80, pulse 62, respirations 16.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation except for decreased breath sounds at the left base.
RECTAL:  Examination was guaiac negative.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following: WBC 14.7, with 86% neutrophils, hematocrit 27.8, platelet count 247,000, BUN 25, creatinine 1.2, amylase 52, total bilirubin 0.6, lipase 64, ALT 21, AST 28, LDH 215, alkaline phosphatase 156, albumin 1.9.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was admitted for further treatment and evaluation of the pancreatitis.
MRI revealed focal pancreatitis with marked inflammation involving the pancreatic head and neck.
The MRI also revealed cholelithiasis without choledocholithiasis, multiple liver cysts, bilateral pleural effusions and ascites and no evidence of pancreatic or ductal dilatation.
Chest x-ray was suggestive of possible left lower lobe pneumonia and Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was subsequently started on Levaquin.
Noncontrast CT was performed at this time, which revealed interval enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Vitamin K was also added to the TPN to increase INR of 1.8 to 2.
Ascitic fluid was tapped, which revealed white blood cells of [**Pager number **], RBC 899 with 56% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, total protein 3.5, amylase 15, albumin 1.3, triglycerides 18.
Cultures of the fluid revealed no growth.
Surgery consultation was obtained on [**2154-8-26**] due to increased size of fluid collections/phlegmon/question of pseudocyst, for further evaluation and management.
Triglycerides levels were checked in case TPN with fat was causing elevation.
Echocardiogram was performed on [**2154-8-28**], which revealed mildly dilated left atrium and severe left ventricular hypokinesis, mild AR, and mild-to-moderate MR with an EF of less than 20%.
On [**2154-9-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 26.5.
The abdominal distention was felt to be improving and Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was again slowly advanced in diet.
Head CT was performed to rule out a stroke.
This examination was negative.
Chest x-ray revealed increased pleural effusion.
On [**2154-9-11**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was noted to have a temperature of 101.3 with respiratory rate in the 40s.
Blood cultures were sent and chest x-ray revealed left pleural effusion versus left lower lobe pneumonia.
Thoracentesis on the left was performed and 1200 cc fluid were removed.
Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was started on Ciprofloxacin and elbow bursa and sputum cultures were followed.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on discharge revealed the following:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.7, pulse 100, blood pressure 132/84, respirations 30, oxygen saturation 92% on two liters.
Tube feeds, Impact with fiber at 70 cc per hour.
