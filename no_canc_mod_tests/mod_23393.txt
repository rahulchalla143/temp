Shortly, he had an episode of vomiting and 3 more after that in next hour.
Per ED team, his blood pressure was 177 systolic when he presented.
ED team got CT head which revealed 3.2 cm right cerebellar bleed, hence neurology and neurosurg were consulted.

CT head: 3.2 cm right intraparenchymal cerebellar hemorrhage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
CT scan of the head was performed, which showed a 3.2 cm right cerebellar hemorrhage.
A repeat CT scan was performed the morning after admission, which showed a stable hemorrhage.
An MRI was subsequently performed to evaluate for possible etiologies of the bleed and this showed multiple additional foci of prior parenchymal hemorrhage in the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, subcortical white matter and left cerebellum.
The hemorrhage secondary to the amyloid angiopathy was then likely exacerbated by the patient being coagulopathic secondary to the Coumadin the patient was on for a. fib (initial INR was 2.9).
A lipid panel was performed as part of the stroke work-up and this noted dyslipidemia, so the patient was started on Simvastatin.
Patient received prn doses IV Hydralazine to help control blood pressure.
The patient continued to require IV doses Hydralazine despite the standing anti-HTN meds; however, one night after receiving a dose of IV Hydrlazine for a BP of 170s systolic, the patient developed an episode of epigastric pain and chest pain without radiation that was associated with lightheadedness.
Patient became hypotensive at this time with SBP into 80s.
An EKG was performed which showed ST changes concerning for ischemia.
A cardiology consult was obtained and the patient was transfered back to the ICU for closer monitoring.
An outpatient stress test is reccomended to further work-up this event.
In a separate event, patient developed a. fib episode with RVR; heart rate into 160s.
Renal: After the hypotensive episode, patient had Creatinine level rise to 1.4 from 1.2.
Another possibility for the elevated creatinine is the addition of Lisinopril for blood pressure control.
Will need to monitor BUN and creatinine as an outpatient.
Heme: Hematocrit trended down after hypotensive episode with concurrent drop in Hemoglobin from 13.5 to 11.5.
Iron panel was ordered, there was no evidence of acute blood loss or iron deficiency anemia.
Metoprolol now at 50 tid for rate as well as blood pressure control.
A CT scan of your brain showed that there was a bleed in a part of your brain called the cerebellum, resulting in the above symptoms.
The cardiologists would like you to get a stress test as an outpatient to be followed by your PCP.
