TTE was a limited study due to the large, open sternal wound, but showed EF 60% and evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
On [**7-13**] pt had a thoracentesis with 1200cc of fluid removed.
Pleural fluid had total proten 4.3 (serum 6.4), LDH 134 (174 serum), which was exudative.
Creatinine again bumped up slightly, likely due to diuresis.
# Infection/?PNA: CXR on admission shows that the heart is enlarged.
# Paroxysmal Afib/Rhythm: Pt is higher risk due to PFO seen on echo done at OSH.
# Access: [**Name (NI) **], Pt has a RIJ clot visualized on chest CT on last admission.
PRS part [**2180-7-17**] Underwent sternal wound debridement and latissmus dorsi flap closure on [**2180-7-17**] without complications.
Electrolytes were folwed and K and Mg were repleted as needed.
urine output was adeq.
His HCT remained stable and lytes were repleted as necess.
Had basilar crackles on exam and CXR showed fluid in R lung field.
EKG and enzymes were negative and he was diuresed with Lasix ande he was placed on O2 NC (initally 5L) and titrated down.
O2 sats and symptoms improved with Lasix administration (goal was 500 negative per day) and his last Lasix dose was on [**2180-7-26**] (40 PO BID had been TID previous days) and it was stopped because his O2 sat was stable off of O2.
