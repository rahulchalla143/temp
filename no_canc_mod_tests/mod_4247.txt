EMS was called and noted O2 sat 84% of and systolic BP in 80s.
In the ED, patient's initial vital signs were: 103.2 122 112/48 28 98% 4L NC.
Blood and urine cx were obtained and patient was given levaquin/CFTX for fever without a clear source of infection.
CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
Labs were notable for CK of 5000.
Head CT was negative, LP bland.
CT abdomen/pelvis was also obtained for belly pain which showed no acute intra-abdominal process.
In the MICU patient continued to meet criteria for SIRS (T102.5 HR 120-140 MAP 104 on levo, RR 26 98% on CPAP and CXR was concerning for atypical or viral pneumonia.
Her coverage was therefore broadened to vanc/zosyn, CT chest was obtained showing no PE.
Viral swab was obtained which returned positive for parainfluenza; abx were discontinued.
Her CK also trended down on IVF (5000-->2969-->941-->559).

Patient developed leukocytosis [**Date range (1) 22666**] and was found to be C diff positive [**2119-5-15**] and received appropriate treatment with vanc/flagyl.
CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
LP performed and CSF without signs of infection.
Pt was persistently hypotensive, meeting SIRS criteria, with fever spikes on antibiotics and was placed on levophed for blood pressure support.
She had an CT abdomen and pelvis which was negative for any acute process.
Had CT chest with contrast to assess for possible PE, which was negative.
Parainfluenza swab came back positive on HD#3 and all antibiotics were discontinued.
Cortisol level checked on [**5-7**] but inaccurate given previous steroid administration.
Patient's oxygen demands were weaned with the assistance of combined nebs, gentle Lasix diuresis and steroids.
She was switched to dexamethasone 2 mg PO q8h hrs before transfer to the floor on HD3 so that [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test could be performed.
Patient was trialed off steroids on HD4, however and SBP remained >100 until patient developed hypotension with C diff infection [**2119-5-15**].
#) C diff/Leukocytosis/SIRS physiology: Patient's white count increased from 12.8 --> 14.9 --> 16 --> 20 from [**2119-5-12**] to [**2119-5-15**].
PA and lateral CXR was obtained [**2119-5-14**] and repeated [**2119-5-15**] given patient's risk for superinfection and pulmonary edema however findings were unchanged from [**2119-5-9**] with low lung volumes and mild bibasilar atelectasis, negative for new acute process.
Blood cultures, urinalysis and cultures, and C diff toxin test were obtained [**2119-5-15**] and C diff toxin test returned positive (U/A negative, Bcx and UCx no growth to date).
BP ranged from 110-90/68-50 from [**2119-5-15**] overnight to PM [**2119-5-16**] with HRs 100-110.
Patient remained euvolemic on exam (non-orthostatic, JVP 3-4cm, no edema, lung exam stable bibasilar crackles), Is and Os even.
Pt was given 2x500cc IVB without change in HR and an AM Cortisol [**2119-5-16**] was appropriate at 21.9.
Her vitals improved [**2119-5-17**] with HR 90s-110s and SBP>90 and DBP>50 at all times as her WBC trended down to 14.
CXR showed evidence of mild pulmonary edema in the presence of fluid administration.
TTE was performed which showed suboptimal image quality, but mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with excellent global biventricular systolic function.
Metoprolol was restarted and patient's heart rate remained between 80-100.
Presenting CK was > 5,000; likely secondary to fall/trauma.
Provided initially with continuous fluid and checked TID electrolytes with appropriate down trend in CPK.
CK decreased gradually to 233 on [**2119-5-11**].
Neurology was consulted for evaluation given her history of a fall in [**2118-10-10**] and her current presentation which involved loss of consciousness with loss of urine and mild rhabdomyolysis.
Neurology suggested EEG which showed slightly slow background representing a mild encephalopathy.
Neurologic evaluation and follow up: Neurology was consulted for evaluation given her history of one other fall in [**2118-10-10**] and her current presentation which involved loss of consciousness with loss of urine and mild rhabdomyolysis.
Neurology suggested EEG which showed slightly slow background representing a mild encephalopathy.

At that time you were confused and short of breath with a fast heart rate and low blood pressure.
Since there is no cure for parainfluenza, we provided support for you in the intensive care unit with fluids and IV medications to keep your blood pressure up and inhaled medications and oxygen while you recovered.
We rechecked your blood, urine, stool, and chest xray to look for an infection and found an infection in the stool (C.difficile).
Your white blood cell count, blood pressure and heart improved on antibiotics.
The cultures of your urine and blood were negative.
On a CT scan the radiologists saw a kidney cyst.
It looked stable in size from prior CT scans, but the radiologists recommended that you have an ultrasound to further view the cyst.
