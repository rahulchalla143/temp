Based on previous cardiac MRI, there seems to be disease within the coronaries, and possibly evidence of scar of the myocardium.
A previous ECHO showed an EF of approx 25%, but CMR EF was approx 40%.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: (-)Diabetes (-)Dyslipidemia (-)Hypertension .
NECK: Supple with JVP of 4 cm, no carotid bruits.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
EF 20-25%.
CARDIAC MRI [**2187-7-4**]: Impression: 1.
Cardiac cath [**2187-12-11**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling presures with a RVEDP of 9mm Hg and slightly low left sided filling pressures with a LVEDP of 9mm Hg.
Systemic vascular resistance was decreased at 11 [**Doctor Last Name **] unit.
Systemic arterial pressures were low at 98/68mm Hg.
The baseline cardiac output and cardiac index were 6.6 L/min and 3.3 L/min/m2, respectively.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo male with h/o h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, PE, tracheobronchomalacia s/p tracheobronchoplasty, who presents for aspirin desensitization and RHC/LHC to evaluate for ischemic cardiomyopathy  # CORONARIES:  Based on CMR, it seems there are lesions noted in the proximal LAD, prox LCX and mid RCA with enhancement of the basal to mid portion of septum which could be c/w scar.
Given these findings, and previous ECHO with EF 25%, there is a concern for ischemic cardiomyopathy.
# PUMP: The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy 25% on echo, then following CMR with EF 41%.

You then had a cardiac catheterization which showed one blockage of an artery but was not felt to need intervention.
