In the emergency department, initial vitals were: HR 70, BP 152/89, RR 22, Sat 89%.
Labs were notable for a neutrophillic leukocytosis of 13.7, 87.8M, 6.7L.
Electrolytes were notable for K of 5.3, BUN/Cr 32/2.0.
Cardiac enzymes were negative, Lactate 8.8.
Chest x-ray was notable for low lung volumes, possible RML consolidation, mildly blunted left costraphrenic angle secondary to pleural thickening vs small effusion, mild pulm vasc congestion.
Vitals prior to transfer were:  HR high 70s, A. fib, BP 104/88, sat 100% on NRB.

Blunting of the left costophrenic angle, may represent a small pleural effusion vs thickening, decreased since prior study  CT: 1.
Pelvic ultrasound from [**8-/2197**] raised concern for ovarian neoplasm.
Constellation of above CT findings may be secondary to metastatic ovarian malignancy.
Following INR correction no lab draws would be obtained.
Septic shock: Pt initially presented for septic shock and was notable hypotensive to the SBP 70s-80s.
Suspect source may be from urinary, abdominal (biliary source given abdominal disease), or pneumonia (Right middle lobe consolidation noted on CXR and CT scan).
