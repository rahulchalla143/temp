Labs were notable for a creatinine 1.7, trop 0.02 and an INR 1.6.
A CXR was c/f left sided PNA.
Given hypotension, a FAST exam was done and the patient was given 1L NS bolus.
Fast exam showed free fluid so a CT A/P was done.
An EKG was done and showed a RBBB reportedly unchanged from prior.
A RIJ was placed and the patient was started on a levophed gtt.

Delayed bilateral renal contrast excretion; Recommend close monitoring of renal function as contrast induced nephropathy is a concern.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
Cardiac index is depressed (<2.0l/min/m2).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
CXR:CHEST, AP: Examination is suboptimal due to underpenetration.
His blood pressures were monitored and were stable with SBP 90-120.
Will ask patient to f/u with PCP and have INR checked.
