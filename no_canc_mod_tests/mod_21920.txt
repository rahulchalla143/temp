Labs at OSH were notable for normal electrolytes, creatinine at baseline of 1.56, BNP of 193, nomral CBC and troponin of 0.068.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
EP was consulted who recommended increasing metoprolol to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], trending troponin and admission to [**Hospital1 **] after interrogation revealed his ICD shocks were appropriate for 330 ms cycle length ventricular tachycardia.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 7 cm, left sided carotid bruit CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Discharge Physical Exam: VS: t = 97.9, bp = 99/58 - 111/56, hr = 81, rr = 18, O2 sat = 99% on RA General: Older Caucasian male, no acute distress, sitting up easily this morning.
Distal pulses diminished but intact.

Compared to the previous tracing of the same date the overall rate has increased with uniform atrial pacing rather than intermittent atrial sensing.
CXR ([**2169-9-7**]): FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph there is no relevant change.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo M with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, recurrent Vtach, atrial fibrillation, and PVD who p/w recurrent VT.
He had an unsuccessful VT ablation, and was started on quinidine and mexilitine, w/ suppression of VT, prior to discharge.
He was monitored on telemetry without event.
Pulses were monitored and at time of discharge were at his normal baseline.
# A fib: Coumadin was continued for goal INR [**1-6**].
Because of interaction with quinidine, coumadin was restarted post-EP procedure at a lower dose, and he will need an INR check 2-3 days post-discharge.
# BPH: Continue flomax  Transitional Issues: - Follow up on hospital thyroid studies - TSH elevated, but T4 normal suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism - Follow up INR check 2-3 days post-discharge - Follow up with EP scheduled for Friday.
Information was obtained from Patient.
Outpatient Lab Work Please get INR checked on Tuesday, [**9-12**] and Friday [**9-15**] 9. quiniDINE Gluconate E.R.
