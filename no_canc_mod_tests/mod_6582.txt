Known coronary artery disease, status post stent to left anterior descending artery in [**2176**]; cardiac catheterization in [**2177**] revealed three vessel disease as well as in-stent stenosis with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 49% at that time.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission, the patient had a blood pressure of 128/70, heart rate 82, oxygen saturation 93% in room air and she was afebrile.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Unremarkable.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, mild congestive heart failure with no pleural effusions.
Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital showed 1.
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations in V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory on [**2180-12-25**], where catheterization revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% as well as significant three vessel coronary artery disease and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Also on [**2180-12-25**], the patient underwent carotid duplex studies which ruled out any hemodynamically significant lesion of either left or right internal carotid artery.
The patient was weaned off of her Levophed and her blood pressure was stable.
Her cardiac function remained good.
She was treated with intravenous Lopressor, which controlled her rate, and was started on oral amiodarone.
Her temperature is 98.4, pulse 70, respiratory rate 18 and blood pressure 136/66.
The most recent laboratory values are from today, [**2181-1-2**], which reveal a white blood cell count of 6,000, hematocrit 27.9, platelet count 211,000, sodium 142, potassium 4.8, chloride 103, bicarbonate 33, BUN 23, creatinine 1 and glucose 107.
The most recent chest x-ray is from [**2180-12-29**] which reveals small bilateral effusions with no pneumothorax.
The patient's weight today is 75 kilograms, which is up slightly from her preoperative weight of 72.8 kilograms.
