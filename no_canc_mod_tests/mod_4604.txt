Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hosp Course: On arrival to [**Name (NI) **] pt stable with T 95.9, HR 78, BP 133/60, RR 16, O2sat: 100% RA.
Neuro exam intact w/o focal signs.
CT head showed left parietal subdural hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Otherwise imaging negative for fractures or other trauma.
Was intubated and had repeat head CT which showed no change.
CT Head ([**10-26**]) repeated, showed new region R frontal hypodensity v. motion artifact with ?developing infarct.
Spine MRI with old T12 compression fracture and spinal stenosis.
Other contributing factors were the subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhages seen on CT scan as well as pain from injuries sustained during fall.
We also stopped her dilantin after 10 days per neurosurgery recommendations, however even off of the dilantin, her mental status did not improve.
Labs were sent for TSH, Folate, B12, RPR which all returned within normal limits.
SAH/SDH s/p fall: CT on arrival to the ED revealed SAH/SDH and repeat showed no progression of these hemorrhages.
Her neuro exam remained non-focal with baseline dementia and superimposed delirium throughout her stay.
Given her exam it was felt by both the primary team and by neurosurgery that further imaging would not provide any further clinical information.
Fever/UTI/?PNA: Throughout her course, she continued to have low grade temperatures with a max of 101.2.
U/A revealed a UTI which was treated.
CXR was unrevealing, but in the setting of increased sputum production and fevers, we treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Her hematocrit was low on arrival (30) and trended slightly down throughout her hospitalization.
She was hemodynamically stable and her hematocrit was stable on discharge.
