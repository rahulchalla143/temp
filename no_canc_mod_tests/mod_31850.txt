ECHO [**2103-7-17**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
GIB: A push enteroscopy was performed that revealed melena in the duodenum and fresh blood in the proximal jejunum 80-90 cm from teeth.
In the MICU, patient received 4U and went from Hct of ~15 to low 30s.
IR was unable to embolize the source of bleed and so patient underwent repeat endoscopy with successful cauterization of the site of bleed.
Patient received an additional unit of PRBCs on the floor and her hematocrit remained stable and she also was continued on protonix [**Hospital1 **].
NSTEMI- She developed chest pain and EKG showed ST depression in V4-V6.
Cardiac troponin peaked at 2.5.
A repeat ECHO on [**2103-7-17**] was mainly unchanged aside from increased left ventricular hypertrophy.
3.HTN- On the floor, blood pressure was not as well controlled off nitro drip and beta blocker.
