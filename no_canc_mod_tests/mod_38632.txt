CXR ([**2138-9-1**]): Interval increase in size of a now large left pleural effusion with associated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and moderate edema.
CXR [**2138-9-14**]: Lines and catheters are in satisfactory position.
TTE [**2138-9-8**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed), anterior septal motion is improved.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 69yo M PMHx Severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2, peak gradient 66mmHg), s/dCHF (EF 20%), recurrent L-sided pleural effusion attributed to CHF, AV node dysfunction s/p PPM ([**2-/2138**]), COPD, CKD, and multiple recent hospital stays for shortness of breath, notable for CABG/AVR w/u but subsequent refusal of surgical intervention, now presenting with SOB.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: # Shortness of Breath: Pt with s/d CHF (EF 20% [**8-/2138**]), critical AS (valve area 0.9 cm2), as well as recurrent L pleural effusion that has previously been attributed to CHF, presenting w worsening SOB, CXR significant for volume overloaded appearance; most likely etiology is complication of AS.
In the CCU, his pleural effusion was tapped (chemistry consistent with transudative nature with negative statin, culture and cytology).
Cultures both sputum and blood cultures were negative.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure has been worsened in the setting of improved cardiac output with very decreased urine output.
His urine sediment showed muddy brown casts suggesting ATN.
As patient became more somnolent, uremia appeared to be a controllable factor as creatinine was climbing with decreasing UOP.
[**Name2 (NI) **] remained afebrile, and cultures from pleural fluid, urine, stool, and blood showed no growth.
His pressure was labile throughout admission requiring a short period of pressure support with phenylephrine.
