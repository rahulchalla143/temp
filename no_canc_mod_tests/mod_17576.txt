Admission Date:  [**2106-5-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-6-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-12-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Benzodiazepines / Furosemide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**] Chief Complaint: Evaluation for liver transplant  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
EGD 2.
Paracentesis 4.
On [**5-22**], she represented with hepatic encephalopathy and T [**Age over 90 **]F where she underwent paracentesis with negative cultures.
CXR showed b/l infiltrates and she received tx with vanco, levoflox, and zosyn and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for liver transplant eval.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she was noted to have numerous small pulmonary nodules on [**5-29**] chest CT of unclear significance.
Eventually blood cultures from [**6-11**] returned [**12-17**] bottles +ve for VRE and was started on daptomycin.
On [**6-16**], the medical team repeated her CT chest to eval for progression of pulmonary nodules and found bilateral infiltrates concerning for infection, bleeding, or aspiration.
Also on [**6-16**] developed new-onset Afib with RVR 150s that responded to diltiazem.
Due to increased volume of diarrhea and climbing WBC count she was started on empiric flagyl on [**2106-6-17**].
Rectal: guaiac negative at OSH Ext: No edema b/t, warm.
-sensory: No deficits to light touch throughout.

RADIOLOGY: ========= [**5-28**] ABD U/S- DOPPLER LIVER ULTRASOUND: No prior studies are available for comparison.
[**5-29**] CT A/P- IMPRESSION:  1.
Comparison with prior CT scans if available is recommended to evaluate for stability.
If no prior examinations are available for comparison, and the patient is a high risk patient i.e.
is a smoker or has a known primary malignancy, a followup with CT of the chest in [**5-25**] months is recommended.
ECHO (TTE) [**2106-6-1**]- Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Portable CXR [**6-4**]: Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.
CT Chest [**6-8**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Eventual CT followup (three months) is recommended after treatment.
Abdominal U/S [**6-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Portable CXR [**6-14**]: IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2106-6-12**]: Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened and new opacification at the lung bases is probably a combination of atelectasis and mild edema.
ECHO [**6-15**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function  is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-6-1**], the tricuspid regurgitation is somewhat increased.
[**6-16**] Chest CT FINDINGS: Since the prior study there has been marked worsening of the alveolar opacities involving both lungs, predominantly in the upper zones.
Attempted to increased intravascular volume with albumin and blood products.
Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, and was negative for SBP.
TTE showed a hyperdynamic EF, with no pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease.
Liver CT completed.
Chest CT demonstrated pulmonary nodules (see below) which were stable on repeat CT chest one week later.
Chest CT from [**2106-6-16**] showed marked worsening (see below).
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**], no infectious etiology was found, with negative blood, urine and stool cultures.
On [**6-11**], pt's blood cultures positive for VRE.
Felt that PICC line was possible source; however, wound tip culture showed no growth.
Echocardiogram was negative for vegetation.
On [**6-16**], a repeat chest CT was performed for further characterization of pulmonary nodules which revealed the interval development of diffuse hazy opacities thought to be consistent with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7470**] given that she was weaned off steroids for AIHA only days earlier.
Diagnostic bronchoscopy was considered upon transfer to the ICU however the patient was too unstable for the procedure.
Reticulocyte count high on admission (29%), with elevated LDH, tbili, and decreasing hematocrit suggestive of ongoing hemolysis.
Blood counts supported as needed with blood transfusions (for hgb <7 given difficult crossmatch (she has two antibodies).
