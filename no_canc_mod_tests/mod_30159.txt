Further evaluation with MRI could be helpful, if clinically indicated.
[**2142-7-3**] sinus CT IMPRESSION:  Relatively mild mucosal changes in the paranasal sinuses without evidence of osseous remodeling to suggest chronic sinusitis.
MRI C/T/L spine [**2142-7-9**] IMPRESSION: 1.
EKG [**2142-7-5**] Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2142-7-3**] no change.
Initially, there was no e/o PNA on CXR (see below).
Her symptoms slowly improved and her peak flow improved to around 350 (reported baseline is 500).
Two CXR's were checked on [**6-27**] and [**7-2**] and both were negative for an acute process.
As a result, a H-CT was obtained which showed a effacement of the basal cisterns and a question of cerebral edema.
These studies were done and they were without evidence of acute hypertensive encephalopathy, sinus vein thrombosis, infarct, or mass.
The Neurosurgery service was then involved and recommended MRI of the spinal cord for further evaluation which showed a small syrinx at C1/C2 and mildly low lying cerebellar tonsils.
Her blood pressure was also controlled.
She was re-started on Norvasc in house to try and achieve better BP control, BB were not used due to her asthma.
HCTZ was then added and her SBP were between 130-140.
Further titration of her blood pressure regimen should be done as an outpatient.
EKG was not concerning for ACS.
The patient had TnI negative X3 while in house.
