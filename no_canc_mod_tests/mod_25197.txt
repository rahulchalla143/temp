No additional areas of high-grade narrowing are identified  CT [**2-16**] IMPRESSION: Stable intraparenchymal hemorrhage in left parietal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and mild mass effect.
Given that the prior CTA was negative for AVM, an underlying mass and amyloid angiopathy are the major diagnostic differential considerations.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2157-2-17**] 2:05 PM IMPRESSION: Evolving subacute/acute hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and mild mass effect.
Chest Xray [**2-20**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with hypertension and atrial flutter who presented with agitation, word finding difficulties and headache, was found to have a large Left posterior parietal lobe hemorrhage at OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
CTA head did not show a venous abnormality.
The patient's neurologic exam at the time of discharge was limited by inattention but notable for disorientation to place and mild anomia.
The patient was also started on metoprolol and lisinopril with good blood pressure control.
Urine and blood cultures were negative.
Chest x-ray was concerning for a left lower lobe pneumonia.
Neurological examination at time of discharge was limited by inattention but noteable for disorientation to place and mild anomia.
You required medications to control your heart rate due to your atrial fibrillation.
