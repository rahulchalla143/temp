Hypercoagulable workup was done.
His dyspnea improved and he was discontinued to home.
An incident finding on computerized tomography scan noted a hepatic nodule which was found during the hospitalization and further imaging was worrisome lesion of the liver and biopsy was arranged.
Anticoagulation was held for a biopsy on [**2163-2-22**].
The patient suffered a hematocrit drop from 38 to 28 and hepatic subscapular hematoma presented on [**2-6**] with right-sided scapular shoulder pain.
On arrival to the Emergency Department the patient was obtunded and diaphoretic with oxygen saturations of 90% via nasal cannula on Dopamine drip.
The patient was started on Dopamine drip with systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
Pulse was always present with systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
Oxygen saturations were very difficult to monitor in the 80s, poor plethora.
Heartrate increased to 120 and systolic blood pressure 80s by doppler.
Electrocardiogram changes without acute ST elevations, sinus tachycardia with poor R wave progression.
PLC placed in the right femoral vein urgently.
In the Catheterization Laboratory, right heart catheterization revealed a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/17, right ventricular 49/15, wedge of approximately 28 and minimal flow to the left lower lobe with some filling in the left upper lobe.
Coronary angiography revealed no significant disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit the physical examination revealed vital signs of temperature 95, pulse 116, blood pressure 101/50, 99% on spontaneous intermittent mandatory ventilatory/700/16/FIO2 of 100%, positive end-expiratory pressure 5/peak flow of 5.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, anicteric sclera, no conjunctival hemorrhage, no jugulovenous distension appreciated.
LABORATORY DATA:  At 10 AM, white count 8.3, hematocrit 35.7, platelets 185, INR 1.6, PTT 25, PT 15.3.
Arterial blood gases 7.24-49-62, intubated at 100%, lactate was 3.9.
CK was 39, troponin less than .3.
AST 37, ALT 29, alkaline phosphatase 67, bilirubin .7, amylase 56, lipase 50, sodium 138, potassium 5.7, chloride 102, bicarbonate 25, BUN 35, creatinine 1.5, glucose 117, homocysteine was 13.7, anticardiolipin IgM was 27, IgG 6.5, Factor V 105, no lupus anticoagulant tested.
Electrocardiogram, sinus with a rate of 119, QRS 114, QTC 463, poor R wave progression, no ST elevations.
The patient also had a transesophageal echocardiogram done on [**2163-3-7**] in the Catheterization Laboratory with an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-30%, severe left ventricular, hypokinesis globally 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, right ventricle dilated and function-depressed, no effusions.
Initially it was hard to get the patient regulated to the PTT of 70 to 90, possibly due to his decreased clot.
His lung examinations were always clear to auscultation.
Chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly with possible mild congestive heart failure.
The patient was off of nasal cannula on the floor and his saturation was over 95% on room air.
Additionally, the patient's Univasc had been discontinued secondary to his creatinine function increasing which will be addressed later.
For blood pressure which was difficult to maintain, the patient had originally been on the Univasc which was discontinued secondary to his creatinine going up.
On hospital day #13, the patient was started on Hydralazine and on Isosorbide Dinitrate to help with blood pressure control.
The patient had an echocardiogram done on [**2163-3-15**] which showed left ventricular cavity to be severely dilated with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and left ventricular systolic function severely depressed.
Left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 20% on this echocardiogram which was a change from the previous one.
Renal - The patient was noted to have an increase in creatinine that continued to rise.
The patient's urine output was monitored and considered to be adequate.
The patient will be a candidate for an ACE inhibitor and possibly diuretics but this was held until the creatinine started to go down to baseline.
