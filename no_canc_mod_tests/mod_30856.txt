HEMATOLOGY:  The patient remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit (30-34) for the remainder of the hospitalization.
The patient's INR remained in the therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) with infrequent low-dose Coumadin (0.5 to 1.0 mg q.o.d.).
Following the patient's initial temperature spike in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with an associated elevated white blood count, the patient remained afebrile, with occasional low-grade fevers and no further signs of infection.
Given the patient's risk for bleeding, the patient underwent a noncontrast head CAT scan on hospital day number ten without evidence of bleed, mass affect, or midline shift.
The patient remained alert, awake, and oriented at the time of dictation and no further workup was required.
A Cardiology consult was obtained with recommendations for outpatient echocardiogram evaluation of the patient's aortic valve given the history of aortic stenosis and elective cardiac catheterization (from the upper extremity) at a future date.
Dosing should be based on daily INR with goal INR 2.0 to 3.0.)
The patient will require daily blood work for monitoring of PT/INR with goal INR 2.0 to 3.0.
