Her blood pressure was 50/20.
She is on 8 mcg/kg/min of dopamine at home and she was given an additional 15 mcg/kg of dopamine to which her blood pressure responded and went up to the 120's over 70's.
Blood and urine cultures were sent from the Emergency Room.
A chest x-ray was checked and the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for further [**Year (4 digits) 7941**].
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20.
Last echocardiogram was in [**2128-1-17**] which showed ejection fraction less than 20.
Left atrial dilation, left ventricular dilation, right ventricular dilation, decreased left ventricular and right ventricular systolic function.
Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, [**Year (4 digits) 2974**].
Her temperature was 98.1, blood pressure 68/34, heart rate 80, respiratory rate 16.
Her mucus membranes were dry.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally anterolaterally.
Her pulses were 0-1+ bilaterally.
Her feet were cool to the touch bilaterally.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  Her white count was 12.0, her hematocrit was 29.3 down from the baseline of 32-33.
Platelets were 130,000.
Sodium 133, potassium 3.9, chloride 100, bicarb 17, BUN 56, creatinine 1.9, glucose 152.
Her CK and troponin were negative.
Her INR was 1.9.
Liver function tests were normal and amylase was normal.
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray:  She had normal heart size.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for [**Name (NI) 7941**] of her blood pressure and possible sepsis.
Her ACE inhibitor was held secondary to her increase in creatinine over her baseline.
Cardiac enzymes were checked which were negative times three.
Pump-wise, her ejection fraction is less than 20% last measured on an echocardiogram in [**2128-1-17**].
Her mucus membranes were dry.
Her BUN to creatinine ratio was greater than 20.
Given her history of congestive heart failure and ejection fraction less than 20, it was felt that more fluids were not necessary and her diuretics were restarted that evening in a goal to keep the patient uvolemic.
Her INR was subtherapeutic on admission at 1.9.
Blood pressure:  The patient was hypotensive on admission.
When she was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit her blood pressure was 120/70.
They recommended a set of blood cultures which was drawn on the evening of the 13th and stool studies.
The stool was sent for stool cultures and Clostridium difficile to date.
At the time of discharge the stool studies have been negative.
Renal:  On admission the patient's creatinine was 1.9.
This was above her baseline creatinine of 0.8 to 0.9.
The patient's creatinine over her hospital course trended down and on the day of discharge her creatinine was 0.9.
This was below her baseline creatinine of 32 to 33 so the patient was transfused one unit packed red blood cells on the evening of the 12th.
On discharge the patient's hematocrit was 36.9.
A hepatitis A antibody was sent which was negative so the patient was discharged home on the 14th with the following instructions.
If she felt that her heart rhythm had become irregular or she was having difficulties with her pacemaker, to contact her M.D.
secondary to blood loss, transfused.
RECOMMENDED FOLLOW UP:  She was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13584**] in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Cardiac Services Center on [**2128-7-8**], at 1:30 p.m.  She was to continue to have her INR checked per her normal routine.
