She went to a referring hospital where she was hypotensive with an SBP in the 70s.
A CT torso there showed intra-abdominal bleeding with active extravasation that appeared to be retroperitoneal in nature.
She was given 1500cc of IVF, 1 unit of pRBC, and 1 unit of FFP and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Upon arrival she had a BP of 113/65 which then dropped to the high 80s, which was responsive to IVF.
Hgb on presentation at OSH was 11.7 and then 8.7 on recheck.

Following this, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.
A DSA celiac trunk run demonstrated normal anatomy of the splenic and hepatic artery as well as the GDA, specifically without evidence of active extravasation.
A Renegade STC microcatheter and Transcend guidewire were now advanced over the Cobra catheter to selectively cannulate the branch identified.
Wires, catheters, and the sheaths were then removed and hemostasis successfully achieved by holding pressure for about 20 minutes.
The patient was initially consented for an exploratory laparotomy upon evaluation by the ACS service in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
After a second review of the available CT scan images, interventional radiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] to perform an angiogram and attempt to isolate and treat the source of bleeding without the need for surgical exploration.
Serial hematocrits were followed which were overall stable during her ICU stay in the range of 23-25, and she did not require further transfusion.
Her vital signs were closely monitored for signs of tachycardia or hypotension, and these remained within normal limits.
Her creatinine bumped to 2.0, thought to be acute renal failure secondary to the contrast load from the CTA and angiogram.
On [**8-29**], her WBC count and creatinine trended down and her hematocrits remained stable.
Her hematocrit was 22.4, still stable having been in the low-mid 20's over the past few days of her admission.
Medications on Admission: sertraline 50mg daily, donepezil 10mg daily, amlodipine 5mg daily, HCTZ 25mg daily, lasix 10mg daily, atenolol 50mg daily, simvastatin 10mg daily, Klor-Con 25meq daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
