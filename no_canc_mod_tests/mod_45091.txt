Given that the patient did not desire any further interventions, a cardiac catheterization was not performed.
Persistent efforts at medical management were maintained with continuation of beta blocker therapy, Hydralazine and nitrates for improved forward flow, however, the patient's blood pressure did not always tolerate the continuation of these medications.
Over the next few hospital days, an attempt was made to maintain the patient's blood pressure at appropriate levels, however, inotropics were not to be used.
