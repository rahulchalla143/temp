GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
A well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring is seen with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 6 mmHg).
Regional and global left ventricular systolic function are normal.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W&W/O C Reason: assess for bleeding, injury to liver [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 34 year old man s/p MVR with traumatic injury to liver with angiocath intraop, now with distended abdomen, dropping hematocrit.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images are acquired from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis with and without intravenous contrast.
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to a prior study dated [**2174-6-22**].
Previously noted right lower lobe nodule is not again seen on image #11 of series 4, unchanged since the prior exam.
There does appear to be a splenic laceration, well seen on image #26 of series 4.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Cross clamp time was 71", cardiopulmonary bypass time was 93".
Mr.[**Known lastname 6884**] was transferred to the CVICU intubated, requiring Propofol and Neosynephrine drips to optimimize blood pressure and cardiac output.
Mr.[**Known lastname 28388**] immediate post operative course was complicated by hemodynamic instability due to anemia with hematocrit dropping from 35 to 16.
The addition of Levophed was required and serial monitoring of hematocrit,platlets, and fibrinogen ensued, along with transfusion of multiple blood products.CT csan of the abdomen revealed extensive hemoperitoneum with no obvious source.
Upon exploration a liver evulsion and splenic laceration was identified and cauterized.Please refer to Dr[**Location (un) **] operative report for further details.
[**4-21**] Mr.[**Known lastname 6884**] was taken back to the OR to have his abdomen washed out and closed.
ID was consulted due to postoperative fevers and in light of his recent hixtory of endocarditis.ABX regiment and serial pan cultures were performed.
His right groin incision demonstrated purulent drainage that required a wound vac for several days.
