Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-12-2**] the findings are similar  [**2154-12-3**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**7-27**]: Lung volumes are lower and there is a mild-to-moderate degree of subsegmental atelectasis at both lung bases.
Likely an epidural catheter projecting over the midline but course indeterminate \  [**2154-12-4**]: CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-4-23**], left ventricular dysfunction is more pronounced c/w interim ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-12-3**] the rate is faster and ventricular ectopy is new.
[**2154-12-9**]: CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There is no evidence of pneumothorax on the current radiograph.
[**2154-12-9**]: CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1.
A large collection from the distal esophagus into the upper mid abdomen that contains gas bubbles and debris within it, compatible with an abscess, which is most probably secondary to a leak.
[**2154-12-9**]: BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT: IMPRESSION: Leak at the gastrojejunal anastomosis  [**2154-12-11**]: ECHO: IMPRESSION:Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction with potential regionality  [**2154-12-12**]: ECHO: IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate global left ventricular systoilc dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-12-11**], biventricular systolic function has improved.
[**2154-12-14**]: CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2154-12-22**]: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-22**], 4:39 a.m.: Moderate right pleural effusion is smaller.
[**2154-12-30**]: UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB: IMPRESSION: No evidence of anastomotic leak or obstruction at the gastrojejunostomy.
On POD 1, the patient's oxygen saturation levels dropped to below 85% after maintaing sats in the 90s on 3L NC, the patient triggered on the floor and required 5L of continuous oxygen via face mask to maintain >90% oxygen saturation.
A STAT CXR was ordered and revealed mild-to-moderate degree of subsegmental atelectasis at both lung bases with no evidence of pneumothorax.
EKG was unchanged from previous study.
On POD 2, He was given a dose of lasix and a CT scan was ordered.
Following the lasix dose, the patient was weaned from the facemask to 3L NC, however, the Chest CT revealed a right segmental pulmonary embolism.
Subsequently, a heparin gtt was initiated to maintain PTT 60-80 and eventually transitioned to therapeutic lovenox.
An Abd/ Chest CT and UGI series was suggestive of a large collection from the distal esophagus into the upper mid abdomen containing gas bubbles and debris, compatible with an abscess, likely secondary to leak; also a small right sided pneumothorax was noted.
Given the findings, the patient returned to the operating room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy and irrigation of abdominal cavity, placement of drains x3 and placement of a right-sided chest tube.
CV: Vital signs were routinely monitored.
An EKG remained unchanged showing left bundle branch block, a troponin x 1 was negative and an ECHO revealed EF 20-25% likely related to demand ischemia per report.
A repeat echo cardiogram was performed on POD [**8-24**] and [**9-24**] with progressively improved systolic function (EF 35-40%).
An abdominal CT obtained the following day indicated several fluid loculations in the right hemithorax with complete collapse of the right lower lobe.
On POD 13/6, the patient underwent bronchoscopy with evidence of mucus plug or excessive secretions.
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO, however, his diet was gradually advanced beginning on POD1 following a negative Abd CT scan and subsequent removal of the NGT.
A repeat Abd CT and UGI series were performed and indicative of a large collection from the distal esophagus into the upper mid abdomen most likely from an anastamotic leak at the GE anastamosis; as described above, the patient was subsequently taken back to the operating room for an abdominal washout and placement of 2 additional JP drains.
After UGI study and subsequent methylene blue test showed no evidence of leak he was started on trophic tube feeds at 10cc/hr on POD 19/12.
TPN was weaned as the TF rate increased and eventually disconitnued on POD 24/17.
On POD 28/21, a repeat UGI series suggested no leak, therefore, the diet was advanced to stage 1, which was well tolerated.
ID: Patient was noted to have low grade fevers in the immediate post op course and was found to have positive blood cultures, growing G+ cocci in pairs and clusters on POD [**7-23**] and was started on Vanc/Zosyn/Fluc.
His WBC peaked at 12.6 on POD [**9-24**].
There was concern for HAP but his mini BAL and sputum were negative.
Repeat blood cultures afterwards had no growth.
He had pleural fluid sampled on POD [**9-24**] that grew Veillonella species on placment of a right sided pigtail that returned 100cc of purulent drainage on insertion.
The following day his CT scan showed that he had a loculated enhancing pleural effusion.
Post-operatively, blood sugars were controlled with a regular insulin sliding scale.
Prophylaxis: He was maintained on subcutaneous heparin until he was found to have a pulmonary embolism as mentioned above, at which point he was transitioned to a heparin drip, with goal PTT of 60-80.
A Factor Xa was therapeutic at the time of discharge.
