Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor native endocardial border definition.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Echo contrast used.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-2**], the LVEF appears improved.
He underwent preoperative workup and in the cardiac care unit.
