No other interval change can be seen on the chest examination in comparison with the supine image of [**2167-8-1**].
Page was placed at 3:40 p.m.   KUB [**2167-8-2**]: There is scattered air within non-dilated loops of small and large bowel with no air-fluid levels on the semi-erect study to suggest bowel obstruction.
CXR [**8-1**]: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and asymmetrical perihilar and basilar opacities, left greater than right.
Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete evaluation when the patient's condition allows.
CXR [**7-31**]:FINDINGS:  Vagal nerve stimulator device noted overlying the left hemithorax.
CXR [**7-29**]:Vagal nerve stimulator projects over the left chest wall.
CXR EKG: SR at ~80bpm with episodes of bigeminy on rhythm strip  EKG [**2167-8-1**] pm: afib w/ RVR to ~130bpm (converted to sinus)  TTE [**2167-8-4**]:The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 65%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CXR at that time revealed ?opacities and patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime.
On [**8-1**], patient went into atrial fibrillation with HRs in 130s.
However on day of transfer she again was febrile to 101.8 and was converted back to afib with HRs in 140s.
VS on evaluation were Tm 102 Tc 99.1 130/70 115 99%2LNC.
While in the MICU she was maitaining good oxygenation on room air and her heart rate was controlled on metoprolol tartrate 37.5 mg four times daily and started on a baby aspirin.
An echo performed on [**2167-8-4**] showed no evidence of valvular dysfunction or left atrial enlargement.
[]ACTIVE ISSUES: #Tachycardia with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate (Afib with RVR): On [**2167-8-1**], pt had afib with RVR at 145bpm and converted spontaneously to sinus rythm with bigeminy.
She maintained good blood pressures despite this tachycardia and had no chest pain.
She underwent a trans-thoracic echocardiogram on [**8-4**] which was normal.
Her max temperature was 102.7 and pt continued to be febrile on [**2167-8-1**] and [**2167-8-2**].
A urinalysis was not suggestive of infection.
She was given normal saline and creatinine kinase has downtrended since then to normal ranges.
She was unable to tolerate NGT, so speech and swallow evaluation was placed, which revealed she would be able to tolerate pills.
Information was obtained from  Group Home.
Metoprolol Tartrate 75 mg PO BID hold for SBP < 90, or HR <60 13.
You were noted to have an irregular rhythm and were given medicine to slow your heart rate, which worked well.
