The patient was intubated and the postcardiac arrest EKG showed ST elevations in II, III, and aVF.
The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization and was found to have the following results:  Cardiac output of 4.72, cardiac index of 2.55, normal filling pressures.
Angiography showed a right dominant system with a patent LMCA and LAD to mid LAD with intramyocardial bridge with systolic compression.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  96.3, 75, 114/73, 124/77, arterial line 12, 100% oxygen saturation on a ventilator with a PEEP of 5 and pressure support of 5, tidal volume 700.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 14.0, hematocrit 44.1, platelets 262,000.
The electrolytes showed a sodium of 138, K 3.7, chloride 90, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 1.0, glucose 107.
The urine was negative for alcohol, negative for cocaine, positive for benzodiazepines and for aspirin, most likely secondary to administration of these agents in the ER.
The patient's cardiac enzymes ruled him in for a myocardial infarction and his cardiac catheterization results are as described previously.
He had an echocardiogram checked to assess his systolic function.
This echocardiogram showed that the left atrium was normal in size.
Otherwise, a repeat EKG was checked which showed that the ST elevations had resolved.
He had a lipid panel checked and LFTs which showed elevated cholesterol.
