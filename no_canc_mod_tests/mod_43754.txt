Time passed and at 4.30PM or so her coworkers decided to go out and look for her.
EMS was called and the patient was found not moving the right side, still not following commands, with pupils reactive, FSG 233, BP 184/120.
On arrival at 5/25pm NIHSS score 23: 1.
CN exam with PERRLB 3.5->3mm bilaterally and right facial droop.
Remainder of exam limited by precipitous intubation.
Exam in ICU on propofol - very limited.
Exam upon discharge: awake, alert, following simple commands, non-verbal, but seems to understand well PERL, limited tracking, R-facial droop, severe dysphagia Dense R-hemiplegia; able to move L side spontaneously Sensory exam intact to noxious (localized on L; withdraws some on R)  Pertinent Results: [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   PLT COUNT-315 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   PT-12.0 PTT-18.5* INR(PT)-0.9 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   WBC-13.1* RBC-5.18 HGB-15.2 HCT-43.0 MCV-83 MCH-29.3 MCHC-35.3* RDW-13.5 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   WBC-13.1* RBC-5.18 HGB-15.2 HCT-43.0 MCV-83 MCH-29.3 MCHC-35.3* RDW-13.5 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   ALBUMIN-4.4 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   CK-MB-3 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   ALT(SGPT)-36 AST(SGOT)-33 CK(CPK)-121 ALK PHOS-81 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   GLUCOSE-268* UREA N-13 CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-4.7 CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-19 [**2119-11-21**] 09:45PM URINE  bnzodzpn-NEG barbitrt-NEG opiates-NEG cocaine-NEG amphetmn-NEG mthdone-NEG [**2119-11-21**] 09:45PM URINE  HOURS-RANDOM .
CXR [**11-20**]: An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip at the lower margin of the clavicles.
Initial CT [**11-20**]: FINDINGS: There is a large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the left basal ganglia which measures 6.2 x 2.5 cm.
Examination of the bone windows demonstrates normal aeration of the visualized portions of the mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses.
Susceptibility images are remarkable for innumerable foci of susceptibility in the cerebral and especially cerebellar hemispheres.
TECHNIQUE: 3D time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
ECHO [**11-28**]: Conclusions: 1.
CXR [**12-4**]: 1.
ICU course: Dilantin was loaded for ?shaking in ED, intubated at time (preintubation NIHSS score was 22).
Repeat head CT showed slight worsening of L-ICH.
Drop in pressure was either sepsis-related (with aspiration pna) or related to damage of insula and autonomic instability.
EKG was sinus tach.
On [**11-21**], BP had stabilized and the pt was off pressors; CXR had demonstrated pulmonary edema, widened mediastinum thought related to volume overload/hilar infiltrates.
Neurologically, exam was unchanged.
On [**11-23**] she underwent MRI/MRA of the brain which revealed many microhemorrhages on susceptibility; there was the question of a developmental venous anomaly in L anterior temporal lobe adjacent to the hemorrhage, as well as the question of multiple cavernous malformations.
A fasting lipid panel was checked which was within goal limits: TC 134  TG 74  HDL 65  LDL 54.
Over the next 24-48 hours, as she diuresed (and after being digoxin loaded), her heart rate returned to sinus, in the 80s.
Heart rate was improved and neurological exam was stable.
She was started on linezolid for VRE positivity and spiking temps, wbc ct 14.5, and for pus at the site of one of her lines (which was replaced).
Her neurological exam was stable: she was awake, alert, able to follow simple commands, R-hemiplegia, and she was non-verbal (but able to understand some).
This regimen will need further adjustement based on FSBS.
Tubefeeds were resumed and fluid boluses were given to treat a hypernatremia (but watch out for pulmonary edema).
Sodium on the day of discharge: 147.
For prophylaxis, a bowelregimen, heparin sc, and lansoprazole were given.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 ml IV DAILY:PRN Peripheral IV - Inspect site every shift   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1.
