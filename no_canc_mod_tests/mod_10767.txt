The patient was undergoing a preoperative evaluation for a right total knee replacement and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation in [**2182-5-12**] with severe CHF and moderate mitral regurgitation by echocardiogram.
The patient was admitted to the hospital for cardiac catheterization which showed an ejection fraction of 55%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, LVEDP of 24, a 50% LAD lesion and a 90% circumflex lesion.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: 1.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The patient underwent carotid ultrasound preoperatively which were without flow-limiting stenosis.
The patient also underwent a ligation and stapling of the left atrial appendage.
On initial Gram's stain, the valve showed 2+ gram-positive rods and 2+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
The subsequent valve culture grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.
The patient's creatinine was monitored carefully and it remained in the range of 1.5.
On chest x-ray, it was noted that the patient had elevated left hemidiaphragm with left lower lobe atelectasis.
This finding persisted through all of the patient's postoperative chest x-rays in spite of the patient maintaining good room air oxygen saturation and aggressive pulmonary toilet.
The chest x-ray at that time showed no infiltrate and no effusion on the right side.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection fraction of 40% without any significant changes in wall motion abnormality.
The chest x-ray again showed no infiltrate or effusion.
Coumadin 5 mg on [**2182-9-19**], INR to be checked and dose to be adjusted for a goal INR of 2 to 2.5.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  T maximum 98.8, pulse 70, in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 100/61, respiratory rate 17, room air oxygen saturation 93%.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Hematocrit 22.8, potassium 4.2, BUN 32, creatinine 1.8.
Chest x-ray on [**2182-9-18**] showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm, mild bilateral atelectasis, otherwise unchanged from previous chest x-rays.
