Admission Date:  [**2154-9-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2154-9-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2112-9-15**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 41 year-old man previously admitted on [**2151-10-22**] for alcoholic pancreatitis leading to adult respiratory distress syndrome and tracheostomy complicated by Pseudomonas pneumonia, pancreatic necrosis, C-diff colitis, line sepsis, left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis, Haldol induced thrombocytopenia and decubitus ulcer.
He was readmitted [**2154-2-22**] for subacute renal failure with creatinine increase to 11.8 and was dialyzed and discharged with an improving creatinine.
In the Emergency Department he was noted to have a blood glucose of 659 and he reported not taking insulin over the last two days.
While in the Emergency Department he became progressively weaker and blood pressure dropped to the 70s systolic.
He was given a fluid challenge, which failed to increase blood pressure or urine output so he was started on Dopamine with maintenance systolic blood pressure in the 100s.
CT scan of the abdomen was performed while in the Emergency Department, which showed multiple abnormalities of the pancrease with calcifications in head, hypodense lesion within the body consistent with pseudocyst versus neoplasm.
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for hemodynamic monitoring, diabetic ketoacidosis, possible urosepsis secondary to nephrolithiasis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on presentation to the Intensive Care Unit, temperature 97.8, heart rate 92, blood pressure 101/60, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
On HEENT examination pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Chest lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination regular rate.
Abdominal examination his abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Rectal examination he had hemorrhoids with enlarged firm prostate guaiac positive stools.
On extremity examination he had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
INITIAL LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count 22.5, hemoglobin 10.4, hematocrit 30.9, platelets 104, MCV 103.
Differential on the white count 56 neutrophils, 37 bands, 7% lymphocytes, PT 13.5, PTT 37.4, INR 1.3.
Chemistry sodium 128, potassium 4.6, chloride 100, bicarb 14, BUN 38, creatinine 4.2, glucose 659.
Alkaline phosphatase 120, ALT 13, AST 14, total bilirubin 0.3, amylase 28, lipase 5, CK 74, calcium 7.7, phosphorus 2.2, magnesium 1.7, blood ketones were negative.
TSH 2.5.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit directly from the Emergency Department and was continued on Dopamine for blood pressure support.
Blood pressure support only transiently.
He was noted to have a creatinine of 4.2 above baseline level of 2.5.
He was noted to have a urinalysis consistent with infection and was found to have three or four blood cultures bottles positive for E-coli.
DIC panel was performed, which showed elevated coags, FDP and D-dimer, but elevated fibrinogen and unremarkable hemolysis studies.
An MRI was performed, which showed pancreatic pseudocyst and obstructed right collecting system with hydronephrosis.
Despite receiving 8 amps of bicarb and fluid resuscitation his blood pressure fell and he was transferred back to the unit on hospital day number five.
The patient's second Intensive Care Unit course was fairly unremarkable with urine output increasing to 50 to 100 cc an hour with aggressive fluid repletion.
Blood pressures stabilized and bicarb normalized with additional repletion.
A renal ultrasound was performed, which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis at that point.
Repeat blood cultures were negative.
Once acute issues stabilized general surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] for evaluation of pancreatic pseudocyst.
Surgery felt appropriate evaluation would include outpatient endoscopic ultrasound to be performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8871**].
Creatinine trended up to reach a peak of 6.5, however, normalized during remainder of hospitalization and was down to 5.8 by the time of discharge.
