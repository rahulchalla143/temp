One EKG with no discernable p-waves and atrial fibrillation .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) with global hypokinesis.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CARDIAC CATH [**2199-9-21**]:  RHC demonstrated CI 1.78, PCWP 28, RA pressure of 5, PAP of 34.

He underwent cardiac catheterization which showed CTO of LCX and no other acute lesions.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE /NSTEMI: The patient had a prior CABG, an MI in [**2187**] and a PCI 6 months ago at OSH.
He initially had no elevation in his CK level and a mild increase in his troponin which was attributed to his worsening renal function.
Unfortunately, however, his CK trended up from 469 to 726 post-catheterization and MB-I went up to 22.3 from 19.8 and troponins increased from .75 to 1.47 on [**2199-9-21**].
Follow-up EKG later in the evening after admission showed left axis deviation, evidence of old inferior wall myocardial infarction with q-waves and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
He had an EF of [**9-25**]% on most recent ECHO and his blood pressures began to worsen throughout his CCU stay.
He entered the CCU with systolic BPs in the 80-90 range which worsened to SBP in the 70s and diastolic pressures in the mid-40s.
An arterial line was placed for better monitoring of his hemodynamics and his non-invasive BP was noted to be approximately 10mmHg less then arterial measurement.
Unfortunately, the patient continued to required increasing amounts of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations above 90%.
ECHO done (TTE) on [**2199-9-21**] showed a dilated LA and LV and severely depressed LV function (LVEF= 15 %) with global hypokinesis.
The inferior and infero-lateral walls were notably thinned and akinetic and there was global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis as well.
AORTIC STENOSIS: On physical exam the patient had a prominent mid-systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right second intercostal space, with radiation into the right neck.
ADDITIONAL CARE / PROPHYLAXIS: -In terms of wound care, the patient was given a Duoderm for additional care of his buttock ulcer during his hospital course.
