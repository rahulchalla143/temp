There is no abnormal STIR signal identified on sagittal imaging to suggest ligamentous injury or acute fracture.
This exam was not tailored for degenerative changes, although there is no significant canal stenosis identified at any level.
B/L lung  consolidations consistent with aspiration  CT head w/o contrast: No hemorrhage, large territorial infarct, or mass effect.
Patient was placed in a cervical collar until c-spine was cleared by CT spine and MRI (performed due to inability to clinically clear given underlying mental retardation and sedating medication side effects).
Although there was initial concern that this may have represented aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, no clear infiltrate was seen CXR and vent settings were able to be weaned quickly.
Sputum cx did grow GPC in chains and clusters and patient was continued on augmentin per plastic surgery recommendations for laceration/ nasal fractures.
