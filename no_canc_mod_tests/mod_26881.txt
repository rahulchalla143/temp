Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Finally, she was felt to have an element of cardiogenic shock given her echo showed severe aortic stenosis which per cardiology was not seconary to sclerosis of the valve but rather due to impaired filling in the setting of CAD and A. fib with RVR.
Patient's most recent echo which was performed during her hospital stay showed severe AS, but per cardiology, likely functional due to CAD and poor filling times in setting of tachycardia.
She was placed on agratroban when INR was below 2, and coumadin was held for the rest of the hospitalization.
Her Hct remained stable.
An echo was performed during her hospital stay and showed an EF of 20% on most recent echo.
Her TSH was checked and was normal during her ICU stay.
