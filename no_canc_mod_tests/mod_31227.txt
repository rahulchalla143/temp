However, increase in shift of midline structures to the right when compared to [**10-21**] study but improved when compared to [**10-20**] study.
Head CT [**11-2**](post-op): IMPRESSION: 1.
EKG [**11-1**]: Sinus rhythm with one atrial premature beat.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2174-10-21**] rhythm is now sinus and voltage has increased.
Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 78	154	100	420/451	31	42	-62  CXR [**11-1**]: IMPRESSION: Mild fluid overload with bilateral pleural effusions.
Cardiac ECHO [**11-4**]: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
EKG [**11-4**]: Atrial fibrillation with mean ventricular rate 97.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2174-11-1**] multiple abnormalities as noted persist without major change.
She had a repeat Ct here that showed enlarged subdural and after discussion with family who preferred surgical intervention she was brought to the Or where under general anesthesia she underwent left craniotomy with evacuation SDH.
Post op CT showed improvement.
Pt's neurological exam continued to be poor.
She had blood transfusions for low hematocrit.
Later that morning, while daughter was present, her SBP, HR and RR slowly declined.
