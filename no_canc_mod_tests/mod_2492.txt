While enroute to CT scan, her confusion degenerated to agitation and she was diverted to the MICU for further evaluation.

HEENT: Dry mucous membranes, pupils slow but reactive once sedated Neck: Patient does react to neck movement, some resistance/rigidity Lungs: Clear anteriorly CV: S1 & S2 regular without murmur Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses with edema, R charcot foot  Pertinent Results: Admission labs ([**2159-11-20**]): WBC-6.5 RBC-4.18* Hgb-11.9* Hct-38.5 MCV-92 MCH-28.5 MCHC-31.0 RDW-16.1* Plt Ct-250 Glucose-679* UreaN-60* Creat-8.9*# Na-121* K-8.5* Cl-82* HCO3-20* AnGap-28* .
[**11-20**]: proBNP-[**Numeric Identifier 15280**]  CXR [**11-20**]: Upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.
[**11-20**] CT head: There is no acute hemorrhage, large areas of edema, large masses or mass effect.
CXR: [**11-21**]: There is significant interval improvement up to almost complete resolution in widespread pulmonary edema.
[**11-22**] MRI head IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study.
If there is continued clinical concern, CT venography of the head could help for further assessment.
MRI with repeat study with diffusion could also help if continued concern for acute infarct.
[**11-24**] MRI/MRA The examination was ordered as gadolinium-enhanced images but after consultation with the MRI technologist, it was decided that gadolinium would not be administered given patient's low EGFR.
All tox screens were negative.
She had blood, urine and sputum cultures drawn that were negative when leaving the MICU.
Urine Legionella antigen negative as well.
Head CT was normal, MRI/MRV showed no acute changes, only chronic microvascular ischmic changes.
Her anion gap was difficult to interpret given her underlying renal disease.
CXR findings: Her CXR was concerning for PNA vs. fluid overload.
Thyroid studies demonstrated elevated TSH, therefore she was restarted on her home dose.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Altered Mental Status  Secondary: Hypertension Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Stable, mental status at baseline, BP 140s-160s, BS<200.
