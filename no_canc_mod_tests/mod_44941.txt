with history of CHF unkown EF who recently stopped taking her medications admitted [**4-14**] with increasing progressive SOB at OSH who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization and work-up for CAD.
CXR at OSH showed cardiomegaly and possible RLL PNA.
CT of the chest was also done that showed PNA with and effusion.
Patient's shortness of breath continued and for further work-up the patient underwent a Persantine stress which showed an old IMI, moderate inferior wall ishcemia and an EF 22%.
Patient was transferred to cath lab for further work-up of shortness of breath.
Cardiac catheterization was significant for 80% LCx, 50% LAD and 40% lesion to RCA; however no intervention was done as the patient complained of arm pain during the procedure.

Imaging: ECHO [**2137-4-17**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed LVEF= 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the basal to distal inferior and infero-lateral walls, apex and moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Coronary catheterization [**2137-4-16**]: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normotension.
CT CHEST NON-CON ([**4-18**]): TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with the administration of IV contrast.
CT OF THE CHEST: A 6-mm hypodensity in the right lobe of the thyroid gland may be further evaluated with a thyroid ultrasound.
Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are noted but do not meet CT size criteria for pathology measuring up to 5 mm in the right paratracheal station (series 2, image 24).
Layering, nonhemorrhagic, pleural effusions are moderate volume on the right and small on the left, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Large calcified nodules in the upper and lower right lungs measuring 20 (series 2, 23) and 36 mm (2, 39) are calcified granulomas.
Layering, nonhemorrhagic, pleural effusions are moderate volume on the right and small on the left, responsible for compressive atelectasis.
CT Brain Perfusion ([**4-21**]): CT HEAD: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, edema, or mass effect seen.
CT PERFUSION: There is an area of increased mean transit time in the right parietal lobe in the distribution of the posterior division of right middle cerebral arterial territory with no corresponding decrease in blood volume.
CTA HEAD AND NECK: Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aortic arch and visualized descending thoracic aorta.
There is pleural effusion on the right side with large calcified granuloma in right upper lobe, better evaluated on recent chest CT study.
Right pleural effusion and calcified right upper lobe granuloma better evaluated on recent chest CT study.
MR HEAD ([**2137-4-22**]): TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, axial T2, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted and gradient echo images through the brain were obtained without contrast.
The study is limited because of extensive susceptibility artifacts.
CXR ([**4-22**]): Lung volumes have improved.
R shoulder 2-views ([**2137-4-24**]): There is severe diffuse osteopenia.
These are also seen on radiographs and on a chest CT both dated [**2137-4-18**] and were thought to represent large granulomas pm the CT scan report.
This mass is avascular on color Doppler imaging and most likely represents a hematoma.

# Left Ventricular Thrombus and Cardioembolic Stroke: Patient was noted to have a left ventricular thrombus present on TTE [**2137-4-16**].
Goal INR 2.0-3.0.
A CTA Head/Neck and CTP were performed showing an increased MTT suggestive of a large ischemic area.
An MRI revealed small punctate DWI/ADC changes suggesting acute cerebral ischemia, predominantly in the R hemisphere.
On day of discharge, INR was 1.0.
Pt had a adenosine deaminase that was very low, and not suggestive of TB in pleural fluid.
Quantiferon [**Hospital6 **] was indeterminate.
The patient's serum histoplasma antibody, coccidio and cryptococcal antigens were all negative.
We repeated a histoplasma urine antigen, to be used by infectious disease at follow-up.
Patient was monitored on telemetry through her admission at [**Hospital1 18**], and would have runs of NSVT that were asymptomatic.
Patient's electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed.
Reivew of records from OSH showing cloudy appearance with 450WBC of the pleural fluid.
Pleural fluid cultures from [**Hospital **] Hospital-[**Hospital1 **] showing VR-Enterococcus spp in the broth culture, though no growth in plates.
The patient also underwent repeat throacentesis, the cultures was which were negative for any growth, and transudative in nature (believed to be secondary to CHF).
The patient had a Xray and ultrasound, consistent w/ hematoma and some chronic changes.
Acute Kidney Injury: Patient presented from OSH with labs there showing a serum creatinine of 1.4.
Patient's serum creatinine upon presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] was 1.0.
Patient's serum creatinine ranged from 0.9 - 1.3 through the admission.
