Initially she was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 170/90.
She had arrived on a Dopamine drip at 5 mcs with a systolic blood pressure in the 50s.
The Dopamine drip was increased and nitropaste was removed with an increase in blood pressure and an increase in her heart rate to the 130s.
Chest x-ray performed was consistent with a right lower lobe pneumonia and she was administered Ceftriaxone at [**Hospital1 882**] and Levofloxacin/Flagyl at the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department.
On review of nursing notes from [**Hospital1 882**] it appears that the patient was initially diuresed with Lasix 40 mg times two, and then she had a decline in her blood pressure and several normal saline boluses were given.
The Dopamine was started after the normal saline boluses did not raise her blood pressure.
Normal EF greater then 55%, left ventricular hypertrophy, severe atrial fibrillation on echocardiogram [**2104-6-1**].
Hypertension - blood pressure on medications approximately 120/60.
Heart rate 133.
Blood pressure 90/33 on a Dopamine drip at 5 micrograms, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation 100% on SIMV, respiratory rate 12 with tidal volume 500, PEEP of 5.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell 8.9, hematocrit 33.3, platelets 181.
PT 12.7, PTT 28.1, INR 1.1.
Urinalysis was unremarkable.
Sodium 138, potassium 3.6 (hemolysis), chloride 96, bicarb 26, BUN 52, creatinine 1.3, glucose 136.
ALT 34, AST 78, CK 127, alkaline phosphatase 64, amylase 94, total bilirubin 0.4, lipase 33.
First set of cardiac enzymes demonstrate a CK of 127, MB of 5, calcium 8.3, magnesium 1.8.
LABORATORIES ON THE DAY PRIOR TO DISCHARGE:  White blood cell 18.5, hematocrit 33.2, platelets 262, sodium 147, potassium 3.6, chloride 115, bicarb 26, BUN 41, creatinine 0.5, glucose 92.
Arterial blood gas demonstrated pH 7.4, PCO2 45, PO2 of 81.  NOTABLE STUDIES:  Echocardiogram on [**2106-2-12**] demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction at 75 to 80%, mild left atrial dilatation, normal right atrium, severe aortic valve stenosis, 1+ aortic regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2106-2-25**] demonstrated prevalvuloplasty, left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures of 205/14 and aortic systolic/diastolic mean pressures of 100/45/65.
Cardiac output was 4.7 with a cardiac index of 3.7.
Post valvuloplasty left ventricular systolic/diastolic pressures were 210/14.
The aortic/systolic/diastolic/mean pressures were 150/60/95.
Cardiac output/cardiac index was 3.6/2.8 positive valvuloplasty.
IMPRESSION:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with severe aortic stenosis with a prevalvuloplasty valve area of 0.45 cm, which has been complicated by congestive heart failure.
Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.
To assess Ms. [**Known lastname 93058**] hemodynamics a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on [**2106-2-17**], which demonstrated a mixed venous sat of 65 to 67%, cardiac index of 3.8 to 4, cardiac output at 4.8.
She had received multiple fluid boluses to sustain her blood pressure prior to the initiation of steroids.
Post initiation of corticosteroids, Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] had several fluid boluses, however, this was to sustain her urine output to acceptable values.
Her peak CK was 157, peak troponin I was 31.7.
Secondary to the long term intubation, Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a tracheostomy on [**2106-3-4**].
This procedure was complicated by some bleeding in to the trachea, which formed a blood clot.
She was suctioned and a bronchoscopy was performed to evaluate the patient's airways.
Significant amount of blood clot and tissue was removed from the patient's airway, several cm above the carina for several days status post trach, the patient required more vigorous tracheal suction, but she had no further episodes of blood clots obstructing her airways.
Prior to discharge the patient tolerated up to 12 hours on a tracheal tent with arterial blood gases demonstrating adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
The pleural fluid demonstrated no organisms or PMNs on gram stain.
Fluid analysis demonstrated that this was consistent with a transudative process, specifically congestive heart failure related.
Secondary to persistent fevers and an infiltrate on the left lung on chest x-ray consistent with pleural effusion, a repeat thoracentesis was performed on [**2-23**] on the left side of the lung.
Repeat chest x-rays demonstrated no significant reexpansion, however, there was no significant accumulation of fluid post removal.
During her hospitalization she was continued on Levofloxacin initially and cultures were followed.
All blood cultures, urine cultures, and pleural fluid cultures were negative.
The patient did grow MRSA from her sputum and she was felt to have a ventilator required pneumonia.
These studies were unrevealing for a source of her fevers.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] required a significant amount of electrolyte repletion of potassium, and magnesium throughout this hospitalization.
Her goal hematocrit was above 28.
Throughout her admission her coagulation parameters and platelets remained stable.
