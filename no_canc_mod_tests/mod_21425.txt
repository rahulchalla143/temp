His examination was unremarkable.
Repeat chest x-ray was obtained to evaluate his pneumothorax.
He was completely asymptomatic with a blood pressure of 106/70.
His coagulations were rechecked with an INR of 1.1.
His partial thromboplastin time was 31.6 and his Heparin was increased to 1200 units per hour and he received 3 mg of Coumadin that evening.
His examination was unchanged.
Amiodarone and Coumadin are continued for atrial fibrillation with a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
Coumadin dosing for this evening only 4 mg with    instructions to check INR on [**2198-9-6**], two days after    discharge, goal INR 2.0 to 2.5.
The patient was    instructed to monitor his INR and have his first INR check    on [**2198-9-6**], and to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 57930**], telephone    number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 57931**], for Coumadin and INR level    management.
