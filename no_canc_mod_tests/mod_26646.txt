Noted to have significant left pleural effusion on chest x-ray for which she underwent thoracentesis.
An echocardiogram showed an LVEF o f 20% with global hypokinesis and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2159-10-30**] revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease with severe LV systolic dysfunction.
Left ventriculography showed at least moderate MR with an ejection fraction of 25%.
Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with 95% stenosis in the LAD with proximal occlusions in the circumflex and right coronary arteries.
Based on the above results, she was urgently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgical intervention.

Postoperative transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated good mitral valve repair with no leak and improved left ventricular ejection fraction with ejection fraction of about 40%.
