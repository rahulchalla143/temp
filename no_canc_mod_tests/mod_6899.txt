Neuro was consulted in the ED and felt the L sided paralysis to be consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 555**] Paralysis and that the hypoperfusion seen on the CT scan was not consistent with a vasculature territory (vessels were all patent), and so therefore more consistent with a seizure activity.
His L sided "densely hemiplegic" deficits began to improve by the time the imaging was done in the ED, also more consistent with seizure.
Also of note in the ED: CXR normal, WBC 10.5 (N86, L9), Hct 45.9, plts 174.
Coags normal with slight elevation of PTT, chemistries normal, CE's negative x1, UA with blood but negative for infxn.
He is admitted to the CCU for workup of his bradycardia; he was apparently supposed to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7965**] on Monday (in 2 days) for evaluation of this bradycardia that has been noted by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
His wife states he has never had problems with seizures, or with cardiac dysrhythmias (other than PR prolongation).

Pulmonary nodule is identified in the left lung, correlation with CT of the chest is recommended for further characterization of this nodule.
[**2188-4-19**] CXR .
Brief Hospital Course: 81M with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glioblastoma multiforme s/p resection and XRT in [**7-7**], VPS for hydrocephalus and stroke admitted to the CCU for syncopal event, bradycardia, and generalized tonic clonic siezure.
There was also concern given that he requires serial MRIs to track his glioblastoma which would not be possible with a pacemaker.
His heart rate was monitored with pulses maintained in the fifties, normotensive, with no concerning symptoms (dizziness, syncope).
Neuro consulted in the ED for L sided paralysis, which was thought to be Toddy's paralysis.
CT head/neck noted a lung nodule which was further characterized on CT Thorax.
