At the time, the patient was initially seen as an outside hospital, and was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] via helicopter.
At the OSH, he was found to be febrile to 101.4, diagnosed with a RLL pneumonia, and started on antibiotic therapy.

Pertinent Results: UCx, Blood Cx sent in ED .
STUDIES: Head CT [**2160-10-25**] : 1.
The hemorrhages seen in the region of the septum pellucidum appear to have resolved but there is persistence of the small right parietal hemorrhage with surrounding edema, as well as the FLAIR images showing what is likely subacute subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There are no abnormalities on the diffusion images to suggest acute brain ischemia.
CT VENOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD: CT venography of the head demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion or thrombosis within the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses.
MRI [**2160-10-31**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Persistent small amount of small subarachnoid hemorrhage at the bihemispheric vertex, with expected evolution of the right frontovertex hemorrhagic contusion, but no other hemorrhage seen.
EEG [**2160-10-30**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a mildly slow [**7-6**] Hz theta frequency background suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
A large portion of this study was interrupted by  electrode artifact.

Blood cultures and Urine cultures pending.
Neurology consulted for assistance in neurological exam and ?
MRI head performed while in MICU - resolving contusion and area of restricted diffusion in R pareital lobe.. Meningitis was entertained as possibility but felt less likely given that per signficant other, the patient has been at this mental status since discharge.
He was worked up with long term monitoring on EEG which showed only slowing and no epileptiform activity.
An MRI showed a slowly resolving contustion an area of possible infarct in the R parietal area which could be consistent with the patient's general state of confusion.
An LP was considered but the patient continued to improve as the neuroleptic medications were weaned off and he became much more alert and oriented.
He finished a course of azithromycin and his toxic/metabolic/infectious workup was unrevealing.
