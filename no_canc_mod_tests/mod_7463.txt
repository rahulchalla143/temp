URINE OUTPUT:  600 cc.
She was evaluated by the emergency medical staff, a CT scan was performed that showed a small bowel obstruction.
On exam, she had a lump in her right groin consistent with an incarcerated hernia, and the CT scan was reviewed and this was clearly the transition point of the bowel obstruction.
PORTABLE DUPLEX DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF THE RIGHT GROIN AND RIGHT DEEP HEMIPELVIS CLINICAL INDICATION: 78-year-old woman with retroperitoneal bleed and question of pseudoaneurysm on recent CT scan.
Color flow and pulse Doppler imaging of the common femoral artery and distally show normal wall-to-wall flow and normal pulse Doppler waveforms.
The imaging was performed extensively through the region of the pelvic wall hematoma.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST There are small bilateral low-density pleural effusions, slightly larger than before, with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
There is a small cystic lesion within or along the neck of the pancreas, which measures 12 x 11 mm in axial dimensions, and is unchanged since the earliest study available, which is a CT of the lumbar spine from [**2173-7-22**].
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a new large acute hematoma in the right lower pelvis, which measures 8.9 x 5.2 cm in maximum axial dimensions, and extends superiorly along the right pelvic side wall.
There is distal right hydroureter up to 13 mm with apparent ureteral obstruction by the large pelvic hematoma, which also displaces the bladder and rectum toward the left.
Although stable over six months, continued CT followup could be helpful to ensure stability within one year.
The presence of acute hematoma and a pseudoaneurysm were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 33863**] from Surgery shortly after the study.
An abdominal CT scan showed small bowel obstruction and rectal thickening.
Urine was positive for infection.
An ECHO was performed which showed normal LVEF and mild TR/AI.
The CT scan was reread and showed a right femoral hernia with right groin bulge on exam.
She was transfused one unit PRBCs for a Hct of 23 to prevent end organ ischemia.
Electrolytes were stable and cardiac enzymes were negative x 3.
Urine was negative for infection.
A urine culture was sent and was negative.
A KUB was performed which showed no evidence of obstruction.
She was given 1 unit PRBCs for a Hct of 24.3  At POD 9 a recheck of her Hct after transfusion showed 18.8.
CT was completed which showed a hematoma in the right pelvis with right hydronephrosis.
Vascular ultrasound showed no aneurysm.
The bleeding had stopped and serial Hcts were stable.
She is to have weekly Hct and Creatinine drawn.
She is to have a CT scan completed to evaluate the hydronephrosis in ~4 weeks and then follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
At ~4 weeks you will need a CT scan to be reviewed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
You will also have weekly blood tests to check your kidney function.
You will need a CT scan prior to your appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Your blood glucose was elevated while in the hospital.
