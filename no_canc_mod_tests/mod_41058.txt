He did complain of cervical spine tenderness on examination and palpation; otherwise, the examination was grossly atraumatic until the examination of the right hip was performed, where there was noted to be swelling with some deformity but no ecchymosis and no lacerations, no signs of an open fracture.
This was stated to be unchanged, compared to prior examinations due to his paraplegia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted at this time to [**Hospital1 346**] for further medical evaluation and treatment.
The patient received a MRI of his cervical spine at this time, was placed in a hard cervical collar, was placed on bedrest and log roll precautions and films were performed.
There was also an x-ray that showed that there was a right subtrochanteric femoral fracture and a left distal tibial fracture.
The patient had a chest x- ray and electrocardiogram that were unremarkable.
All labs were within normal limits at this time.
An open reduction and internal fixation of the right subtrochanteric fracture was done and there was a casting of the left tibia, goals being to better align the fractures.
Also of note, the patient received an air cast at this time and this was to relieve potential irritation or skin break down over his left lateral malleolus as he had been complaining of irritation there.
