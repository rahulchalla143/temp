CTA of the head is recommended for further evaluation.
[**2192-8-14**] CTA Head : 1.
There is no CT evidence of stenosis, occlusion or dissection of the carotid arteries or the vertebral arteries.
An MR is, however, more sensitive to rule out arterial dissection.

There is no CT evidence of stenosis, occlusion or dissection of the carotid arteries or the vertebral arteries.

Bifrontal linear hyperdensities suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage  [**2192-8-15**] CT head 10am 1.
Reappearance of the suprasellar and quadrigeminal plate cisterns, suggestive of improving edema; the degree of cerebellar tonsillar herniation appears unchanged.
Bifrontal superficial linear hyperdensities, also unchanged and suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, diffuse axonal injury or both  [**2192-8-15**] MRI c-spine Unremarkable MRI of the cervical spine.
[**2192-8-16**] CT head 1.
CT head [**2192-8-30**] Rim enhancing fluid collections seen within the right temporal fossa, right frontoparietal subcutaneous tissue and right frontal lobe, which is concerning for abscess formation.
An MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging can be done for more specific diagnosis.
CT torso [**2192-8-30**] 1.
Massive pneumoperitoneum and mixed density free fluid as well as findings consistent with peritonitis throughout the abdomen.
[**2192-8-30**] ECG Sinus tachycardia versus atrial tachycardia at the rate of 150 beats per minute.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-8-16**] the morphology of the P waves is distinct and suggests an ectopic focus of the probable atrial tachycardia.
Clinical correlation is suggested  [**2192-9-1**] MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2221**] somewhat limited by difficulties with patient positioning and motion, as well as the extensive post-surgical changes with abundant residual blood products, 1.
The right-sided extra-axial and scalp fluid collections demonstrate "simple" fluid with only thin and discontinuous rim enhancement more suggestive of post-surgical seromas.
[**2192-9-8**] CT abdomen 1.
The fluid seems to be interconnecting, but follow-up exam is recommended to monitor for loculation and abscess formation.

Brief Hospital Course: Admission synopsis: 30F ped struck, mass lesion from multi-focal ICH s/p R craniectomy, PEG for enteral access c/b leak s/p ex-lap, JT placement, L sc CVL c/b ptx requiring CT, now resolved convalescing well with improving mental status, tolerating tube feeds, and without CT.  Trauma SICU Course: The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] following polytrauma as a pedestrian struck with , primary survey notable for impending airway compromise and asymmetric fixed pupillary exam.
She was subsequently intubated and underwent CT scan following completion of primary and secondary survey revealing intracranial hemorrhage with signs of midline shift and herniation.
No hemodynamic instability Pressors: (-EKG/CE-) (-ECHO-)  Pulmonary: The patient arrived to the ICU with an oxygen saturation of (-) and an ABG demonstrating (-).
CXR on post-operative day (-) demonstrated resolution of pneumothorax and chest tube was placed to wall suction.
Repeat CXR demonstrated no reaccumulation of pneumothorax and chest tube was removed with final CXR demonstrating fully re-expanded lung (-).
The patient was discharged with an oxygen saturation of (-).
(-Home oxygen therapy-)  GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound care:  Incisional wounds were regularly monitored for signs of infection of which there were none.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
(-Tx-) The patient was transfused (-) units pRBC for a hematocrit of (-) with post-transfusion hematocrit of (-).
Disposition: (-DNR/DNI-) (-CMO-)  ACS/Trauma Surgery Floor Hospital course: The patient was initially transferred to the floor on [**2192-8-19**] and did well on tube feeds using a dobhoff.
However, she had low-grade temperatures in the 100s but on [**8-30**] triggered for a temp of 103.5 for which cultures were sent.
A CT scan was done, which showed intraperitoneal fluid collection.
MRI c-spine obtained [**9-4**] shown to be negative for ligamentous injury and c-collar removed.
Urine output was closely monitored.
Patient was febrile to 101.2 [**9-3**] and cultures were sent.
Swallow evaluation on [**9-10**] showed that she was unable to safely swallow at that time and repeat evaluation on [**9-19**] again confirmed that conclusion despite her improving neurological status.
Postop head CT demonstrated no new hemorrhage.
Two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were removed on POD1 [**9-21**] as output tapered to less than 30cc over 8 hours, staples were placed for closure of the drain sites.

?Please return to the office [**2192-10-2**] for CT head at 8:45 and then in Clinic at 9:30AM for removal of your staples, sutures for a wound check with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
For CT scan beofre you appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] please go to [**Hospital Ward Name **] CC CLINICAL CENTER, [**Location (un) **] RADIOLOGY ?????
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast in 4 weeks to follow the cranioplasty and brain injury.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain.
