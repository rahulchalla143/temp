He underwent urgent spine imaging with both CT and MRI, which were concerning for epidural abscess, diskitis, osteomyelitis and collapse of T9 with cord compression with edema from T8-T11.

However, he again became hypotensive in the setting of pressure-support ventilation and an [**Month/Year (2) 7792**].
He also had elevated troponins and was diagnosed w/ an [**Month/Year (2) 7792**] in this repeat setting of hypotension, so the [**Month/Year (2) 7792**] may have contributed to his hypotension by worsening his systolic function, although his LVEF remained at 35% on f/u Echo.
He was able to be weaned off phenylephrine after extubation and was transitioned to PO midodrine for blood pressure support.
Epidural abscess cultures revealed Gram+ cocci.
#[**Hospital 7792**]: In the setting of his hypotension upon his second transfer to the MICU on [**5-31**], he was found to have elevated troponins for which he was started on heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg, and ASA 325 for [**Month/Day (4) 7792**].
His troponins trended down [**6-1**], so heparin gtt was discontinued.
A TTE, which was poor quality, was performed [**6-1**] which revealed LVEF 35%, moderate LV dilated systolic dysfunction hypokinesis w/ distal 3rd of ventricle having hypokinesis, nl R chamber, no AR/MR, and no effusions.
Given continued concern for possible cardiac vegetations or complication such as abscess, a TEE was performed [**6-13**], which revealed no cardiac vegetations or clinically significant valvular disease.
He developed renal failure where his Cr doubled to 2.2 from [**5-31**] to [**6-4**] following his episode of hypotension and [**Last Name (LF) 7792**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was likely pre-renal in nature.
His Cr stayed around 2.0 a week after this event, so this may be his new baseline.
Cr on discharge 1.9  #Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was not on anticoagulation prior to admission and given setting of recent surgery was not started while in MICU.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35% per report from [**2155-6-1**].
# Diabetes Mellitus: His blood glucose levels remained below 240 on SSI and below 150 the last few days of his hospitalization.
Transitional Issues - reassess need for antipsychotics, mental status may be improving and may not have long-term need - assess volume status daily and daily weights, consider increasing lasix dose if weight increasing or appears hypervolemic - consider pacemaker placement for heart block and anticoagulation for both paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and LV aneurysm at cardiology followup visit - Continue ceftriaxone 2 gm daily until [**2155-7-10**] and weekly CBC/diff and ESR/CRP to be faxed to infectious disease nurses at [**Hospital1 69**] #Full code as per HCP, nephew, [**Name (NI) 449**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 976**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 111744**].
