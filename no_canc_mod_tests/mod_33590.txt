Per her family, patient's cellulitis improved but she began to act "wacky;" was saying strange things, hallucinating, and was increasingly somnolent.
In the ED in [**Hospital1 6687**], initial VS were BP 167/110, HR 112, RR 28, SaO2 53% on RA, which increased to 94% on 4L.
In the ED, T 100.8, BP initially 130/56, HR initially 60s but increased to 140s transiently per nursing report (although HRs recorded only to max of 120s).
Consequently, patient was changed from dopamine to levophed, and HR improved to 110s.
During this changed, BP reportedly dropped (again not recorded, and patient bolused 2 liters).

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
This could represent an adenoma, however is incompletely imaged, As indicated previously, this should be further evaluated with an adrenal protocol CT or an MRI.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CXR [**10-20**] IMPRESSION: Pulmonary anatomic detail in the lungs is obscured by respiratory motion.
Pulmonary vascular congestion is definitely present, and there may be mild pulmonary edema.

CXR suggestive of pulmonary edema versus interstitial infectious process.
CTA of the chest showed no pericardial effusion, unchanged mediastinal adenopathy, no PE, dilated main PA, normal aorta, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and moderate pulmonary edema.
On [**10-17**], she had an episode of tachypnea and fever and CXR showed possible infiltrate.
Her Tv decreased and peak pressures increased during this time.
At the time of discharge, the patient's ventilator settings were: Pressure support at 20/5 with 50% FiO2, breathing at a rate of 35, with tidal volumes 300-350cc.
Cultures at OSH showed no growth and cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] show NGTD.
EKG was checked and showed no QT prolongation.
# Transaminitis - This was thought to be secondary to hypotension and hypoperfusion of his liver.
# Guaiac pos, slow Hct decline - The patient's Hct remained stable throughout admission, but she needs a colonoscopy as an outpatient.
