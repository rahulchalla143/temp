ED workup at OSH revealed perforated gastric ulcer for which patient was taken to OR for [**Location (un) **] patch repair of perforated antral ulcer.
CT head obtained emergently was negative.
CT showed increased intra-abdominal free air/fluid.
As pt developed pressor requirement likely [**1-23**] abdominal sepsis decision was made to xfer pt to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgmt.
History/hospital course obtained from patient/[**Year (2 digits) 802**] and limited OSH records.

If there is a very high clinical concern for acute acalculous cholecystitis, further evaluation could be performed with a HIDA scan.
Small volume ascites and right pleural effusion, as on prior CT from [**2121-1-9**].
He was readmitted to the ICU on [**2121-1-8**], shown to have a collections on CT scan and taken to the OR on [**2121-1-9**] for exploration and washout.
Pt was also placed on 20mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix, with good urine output for diuresis.
An echocardiogram done on [**2120-12-27**] showed ventricular systolic function moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) but was otherwise unremarkable.
Repeat echo on [**2121-1-16**] showed excellent systolic function (LVEF >55%) and no WMA.
An UGI was performed with no evidence of leak or obstruction and patient was started on a regular diet.
Patient was transferred back to the ICU and CT scan was performed, showing recurrence of his gastric leak.
Patient was taken back to the OR on [**2121-1-9**] and his abdomen was washed out with drains placed anterior to the stomach.
Initial drain output was serous which turned bilious on [**2121-1-22**].
Percutaneous drainage of the fluid collections seen on CT was performed on [**2121-1-18**].
Cultures were negative for bacteria.
On [**2121-1-26**] the NGT was removed the output from the drains were monitored closely and was noted to decrease over his postoperative course.
His Cr was 2.5 on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] and was monitored, trending down to 0.8. he was also noted with scrotal edema, likely related to low albumin and aggressive fluid resuscitation while septic.
After recurrent leak, patient's renal function worsened to a max Cr of 4.2 and zero urine output for almost a day.
His urine output gradually improved and he was treated with high dose Lasix towards the end of his course of CVVH, to which he responded well.
No further plans for dialysis per Nephrology despite his rising creatinine- it was felt that this would improve ove time and to continue with close monitoring of his electrolytes.
He did receive 2 units of blood on [**1-11**] for a low hematocrit in the setting of persistent need for pressors, and was transfused another 1 unit PRBC on [**2121-1-24**] for a Hct of 22 (mostly stable but down-trending) in the setting of tachycardia.
Full course length and list of antibiotics that were used: [**Last Name (un) **] [**Date range (1) 91864**]/12 Vanco [**Date range (1) 91865**] Cipro [**Date range (1) 91866**] Zosyn [**Date range (1) **] Flagyl [**Date range (1) 29260**] Fluconazole (d/c'd [**1-15**])  His WBC count increased around the time of his recurrent sepsis, peaked at 24.9 and slowly and gradually decreased to 9.0 upon discharge from ICU to the floor on [**2121-1-24**].
Cultures data: Multiple blood, urine, sputum, BAL cultures from this admission.
All negative except for several BALs and sputum growing small amounts of yeast (<100,000) and a [**1-15**] mini BAL culture that grew pan sensitive pantoea species.
