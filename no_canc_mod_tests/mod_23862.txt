At [**Hospital1 **], labs were significant for WBC 5.9, Bili 5 (Indirect 0.6), AP 602, lipase 47.
CT scan demonstrated CBD dilitation of 1.5 cm, intra- and extra-hepatic dilitation, and ?round densities in the CBD (?stone).
ROS: 10 point review of systems negative except as noted above.

Consider MRCP or ERCP for further evaluation.
[**Hospital **] Hospital: WBC 5.9 Bili 5 (Indirect 0.6) AP 602 lipase 47 CT showed CBD dilation, stone  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 70 year old woman with coronary disease s/p CABG (no stents) on aspirin and coumadin who presented with cholangitis.
A CT and RUQ ultrasound on admission showed CBD dilitation and stones.
She underwent an unsuccessful ERCP on [**6-27**] (inability to visualize the papilla).
She underwent an MRCP that same day, which demonstrated 2 large stones in the CBD with intra and extra-hepatic dilitation.
TTE showed no systolic failure but she may had diastolic heart failure.
She also received diltiazem for several episodes of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate and her beta blocker dose was increased.
Coumadin was held due to procedures but she was started on lovenox 70 mg SC BID since will need a repeat outpatient IR procedure (PTC) soon (appointment was scheduled).
She was finally discharged to LTAC as her fluid analysis showed no infection.........Before discharge, she was started on Augmentin to treat mild infection of biliary drain exit site...... .
Radiology will perform another study of your biliary tract during your next appointment.
