An idurated, purulent area in the scrotal raphe and an area on the left buttock were opened.
Pt had CXR which showed hypodensities, concerning for septic emboli.
On CT chest he was found to have numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules, all concerning for septic embolic, infarcts, and disseminated infection felt secondary to abscess.
TTE was negative for vegatations.
Overnight, on [**10-26**], oxygen saturation decreased to mid to high 80s on 4L NC.
He was transitioned to NRB and oxygen saturation improved to low 90s, but patient continued to have increased WOB.

Findings are concerning for infectious process such as septic emboli, and a CT can be obtained for further evaluation.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, increased from the study one day prior.
Lung volumes remain low.
The more rounded appearance to the right costophrenic angle is slightly less apparent on the current examination but still could represent loculated pleural fluid.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Cultures from the wound and blood grew MRSA and patient began treatment with vancomycin.
MRSA bacteremia: Patient had a perineal and buttock wound that grew MRSA in culture and blood cultures that grew MRSA as well.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
The cultures from the wound grew a bacteria called MRSA, and you were found to have this growing in your blood stream as well.
We did an ultrasound of your heart that showed no infection in the heart itself.
START Vancomycin 2g IV q8hr (to be completed [**2112-12-7**]) 2.
