Admission Date:  [**2180-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-1-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-10-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Tetracycline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with no intervention   History of Present Illness: 72F with no significant past cardiac history who had sudden onset chest pressure while shoveling snow on day of admission.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.7 HR 75 BP 103/59 RR 16 SpO2 99% RA.
Blood pressure fell precipitously with IV morphine which responded to 1 L IVF bolus and supine position.
Per report, EKG was remarkable for Q waves in III, otherwise normal.
Prior to cath, she was started heparin gtt with bolus and a plavix load of 600 mg.   Brought to cath lab and found plaque rupture at origin of LAD, right at junction of LAD and Lcx, with focal dissection.
She underwent echo stress test which showed no ischemic ECG changes and no anginal type symptoms with excellent functional capacity.
Echo showed no evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved workload.

Cardiac cath ([**2180-1-10**]): 1.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
These findings in the proximal LAD were unchanged from the angiogram obtained in [**2175**].
CXR ([**2180-1-10**]): FINDINGS: There is subtle increased density in the right lower lobe likely atelectasis.
Echocardiogram ([**2180-1-11**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared to the prior stress echo study of [**2179-6-23**], resting left ventricular systolic function is now significantly impaired.
Stress testing ([**2180-1-13**]): INTERPRETATION: 72 y.o.
The patient exercised for 3.75 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol (~2.7 METS).
Test was stopped due to an asymptomatic drop in systolic blood pressure during exercise.
There was an asymptomatic drop in systolic blood pressure from 94/56 to 92/52 to 82/52 to 80/52 throughout exercise.
Note: Immediately post exercise BP 82/50 (standing) and 110/66 (sitting) ~ 1.25 minutes of recovery.
Asymptomatic drop in systolic blood pressure during exercise.
Perfusion study: Resting and stress perfusion images reveal a mild fixed perfusion defect of the apex with the perfusion otherwise unremarkable.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 70% with an EDV of 65 mL.
EKG on admission: Sinus rhythm.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 y/o F with minimal mitral regurgitation presents with substernal chest pain after snow shoveling with troponin elevation and no EKG changes consistent with NSTEMI, now s/p cath showing non-obstructive plaque rupture at the LAD bifurcation, not amenable to stenting, and upon attending review unchanged from previous study in [**2175-6-15**].
Cardiac surgery was initially involved for possible intervention, but further review of a previous catheterization in [**2179-6-15**] for her anginal symptoms show a very similar, unchanged lesion.
Stress-MIBI showed a mild fixed perfusion defect of the apex with the perfusion otherwise unremarkable and an EF of 70%.
Of note, the exercise portion of the study had to be stopped early due to fatigue and asymptomatic hypotension, and was suboptimal as a result.
Her cardiac enzymes were downtrending and she was discharged on medical therapy and anticoagulation, with close cardiology follow-up.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH 0.070, T4 normal at 8.1.
Medications on Admission: CLONAZEPAM - 0.5 mg qhs prn restless legs FLUOXETINE 20MG DAILY LEVOXYL 88MCG DAILY LIPITOR 10MG DAILY OMEGA 3 DAILY VAGIFEM 25MCG PV Twice a week .
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and a cardiac catheteriation was done that showed a blockage in your left anterior descending artery that may or may not be old.
Initially we considered cardiac surgery but a stress test was done that did not show any concerning abnormalities of your heart which would require a procedure to fix.
