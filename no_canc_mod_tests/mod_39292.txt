A pulse returned after third dose of epinephrine with HR of 12bpm.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial evalation in the ED identified HR 130s SBP in the 80s and SpO2 of 40% and the patient was endotracheally intubated with immediate impromement of oxygen saturation.
Labs in the ED were notable for a WBC count of 16.5K with 87% neutrophils and a lactate of 5.6.
Troponin was 0.08 on initial evaluation in the ED.
Imaging was notable for CT head suggestive of anoxic brain injury without evidence of acute bleed or stroke, chest CTA showed bibasilar consolidation, apical contusions and no evidence of PE and CT abdomen and pelvis without evidence of acute pathology.
Vitals on transfer were HR:100, BP:91/47, RR:22 and SpO2:100% on 100% FIO2.
Initial evaluation identifies an intubated unresponsive woman.

CXR [**2191-1-5**] IMPRESSION: Bilateral pulmonary opacities may be due to massive aspiration, although diffuse infection or pulmonary hemorrhage or contusion not excluded.
CT Chest/ Abdomen/ Pelvis [**2191-1-5**] 1.
Rib fractures of the right anterior sixth and seventh and left anterior fifth and sixth ribs, which are nondisplaced.
ECHO [**2191-1-7**] The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%).
Her EEG was isoelectric suggestive of cortical brain death.
CT chest was suggestive of significant aspiration.
