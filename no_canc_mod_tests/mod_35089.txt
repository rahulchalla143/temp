Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
MRI [**7-9**]: 1.
From an imaging standpoint, it is difficult to rule out residual infection.
CT of neck [**7-16**]: IMPRESSION: Extensive intercommunicating fluid collections with numerous suspended air bubbles at the surgical site in the neck, deep to the right sternocleidomastoid, as described.
Though direct comparison is somewhat difficult, this process does not appear significantly improved and may, in fact, be worse since the enhanced MR examination of [**7-9**].
There is marked left lateral displacement of the laryngeal skeleton and cervical airway, which remain patent.
MRI [**7-17**]: 1.
Persistent signal abnormality at C3 through C5 vertebral bodies and intervening disc is likely related to ongoing inflammation, however, from an imaging standpoint, it is difficult to differentiate between postoperative change and residual infection.
Large fluid collection containing gas at the surgical site in the neck extending to the C3 through C5 anterior prevertebral space not significantly changed from the postoperative MRI from [**2104-7-9**], and better evaluated on CT from [**2104-7-16**].

He had an MRI done which corroborated the cervical spine abcsess and showed a second one in the lumbar paraspinal muscles area (L3-L4, L4-l5).
TTE did not show any valvular or abnormal flow suggesting endocarditis.
Due to persistent fever a repeat MRI was obtained as well as more blood cultures.
Repeat MRI showed a small paraspinal abcess in lumbar region (L3-L4).
Since patient still febrile, but not growing anything on blood cultures, blood cultures were continued.
Neck pain kept increasing, so a CT scan of the neck was done, showing recurrence of the spinal abcsess with a big collection of fluid in the right cervical region.
An MRI ruled out epidural abscess, showed the same osteomyelitis seen in the priro MRI.
Patient currently is blood culture negative.
Pt grew gram negative non-fermenting bacteria pan-sensitive in blood taken from the PICC placed in the right arm.
Patient had acute renal failure, which was contrast induced after the CT scan.
Creatinine went from his baseline of 1.2 to 1.8 on [**7-19**].
WBC trending down, now 7.8 from a max of 18.2.

You were admitted to the neurology service and got a CT scan of your neck and spine.
You had an MRI later, which showed cervical osteomyelitis (infection of the bone).
Since your fever persisted, as well as positive blood cultures growing S aureus, you had another CT of the neck showing a recurrence in the cervical abscess that was srugically drained again.
You will need a vancomycin trough level this Friday [**2104-7-15**]; then you will need weekly (every tuesday) vancomycin trough, CBC, Chem-7, LFTs, ESR, CRP.
