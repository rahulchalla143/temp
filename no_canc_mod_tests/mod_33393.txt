His Hct remained stable on [**5-18**] so he was called out to the floor.
Hct dropped from 30.5 to 21.5, and was transferred back to the MICU for further management of this GI bleed.
He underwent urgent TIPS, with transhepatic gradient decreasing from 28 mmHg to 10 mmHg.

No other hepatic parenchymal lesion is seen to correlate with finding on prior ultrasound study [**2147-4-24**]  Renal u/s IMPRESSION:  1.
There is probable slow reverse flow in the anterior right portal branch, but Doppler tracing is suboptimal, probably as the vessel is diminutive in size as demonstrated on MR study [**2147-5-16**].
MICU Course- Patient transferred to the MICU for EGD on [**2147-5-17**].
EGD showed grade II varices with cherry red spots, likely bleeding from esophageal varices.
Massive transfusion protocol was initiated and he received 11U PRBCs as well as multiple units of FFP and platelets.
He underwent urgent EGD which showed a bleeding gastric varices.
Hct was actually increased on day of transfer to [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] service ([**2147-5-23**]).
No recurrence of melena/BRBPR since TIPS, hematocrit stable at 28-31.
#) Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Cell count consistent with SBP on diagnostic paracentesis on [**5-16**], first episode.
#) HCV with cirrhosis: right upper lobe hypoechoic lesion noted on imaging [**4-/2147**], for which MRI was recommended.
Upon admission, had genotyping, AFP level, HIV test, hepatitis B and A markers, and iron studies.
Thrombocytopenia and INR also at baseline, suspected to be due to poor synthetic function.
If continues to have fever, imaging is consideration (as brought up by primary team, can't necessarily exclude pathology such as epidural abscess given IV drug use and fevers, though have other likely potential explanation with SBP)  .
