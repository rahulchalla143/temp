Status post hysterectomy  Preoperatively, the patient reported the residual deficits from her CVA were occasional aphasia and poor memory.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Vanceril inhaler prn  PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 38.7, platelet count 271.
Sodium 142, potassium 4.5, chloride 107, bicarbonate 30, BUN 17, creatinine 1.2, glucose 128.
PREOPERATIVE Physical exam VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 72, blood pressure 112/80, respiratory rate 12.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Negative NECK:  Bilateral surgical scars.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2157-4-28**] for cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization showed left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 50%, 70% to 80% LAD lesion, 80% LCX lesion, 70% OM2 lesion, 90% RCA lesion.
Chest x-ray revealed a left upper lobe collapse.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy which revealed a left upper lobe mucous plug which was removed.
Post bronchoscopy chest x-ray revealed mild improvement in the aeration of the left upper lobe.
On postoperative day #1, the patient underwent repeat bronchoscopy which showed mild bilateral tracheobronchitis and again a mucous plug in the left upper lobe which was removed.
On postoperative day #2, the patient's propofol was weaned to off at which time the Levophed infusion was discontinued as patient's blood pressure increased and the patient was subsequently placed on nitroprusside infusion to maintain her systolic blood pressure less than 130.
The patient was noted to move head with noxious stimuli and pupils were 3 cm equal and reactive to light, but it was noted that there was no movement of arms or legs.
The patient continued on nitroprusside infusion for blood pressure control.
The patient had been started back on Plavix for her previous carotid endarterectomies and patient had improving respiratory status and was able to decrease the ventilatory support, however the patient continued to have decreased neurologic function and a neurology consult was obtained and a head CT scan was obtained.
CT scan of the head showed a ACA hypodensity bilateral watershed hypodensity extending posteriorly on the left and an old cerebellar stroke.
Her neurologic exam on postoperative day #3 was no spontaneous eye opening, however opened eyes to noxious stimuli.
The patient had positive corneal reflex, positive gag reflex, withdrew all limbs weakly to noxious stimuli.
Neurology felt that it was unclear whether or not that patient's status was due to her preoperative neurologic findings or a new neurologic event and requested an EEG to rule out subclinical seizure activity.
On postoperative day #4, the patient underwent EEG study which showed no epileptic features, generalized swelling with suggestion of encephalopathic condition.
The patient had a sputum culture sent for increasing tracheal secretions which subsequently are positive for Haemophilus influenza and Pseudomonas.
After the tracheostomy placement, the patient as noted on chest x-ray to again have a whiteout of the left side and underwent bronchoscopy for large amounts of bloody secretions.
Subsequent chest x-ray was improved.
The patient underwent repeat bronchoscopy on postoperative day #11 which showed relatively clear airways, clear secretions, no plugs in the left upper lobe.
?, pulse 84 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 139/83, respiratory rate 23, oxygen saturation 95%.
Lungs - breath sounds are coarse with scattered wheezes and rhonchi throughout.
The patient's last sputum culture from [**5-6**] showed sparse growth of Pseudomonas.
LABORATORY DATA FROM [**2157-5-16**]:  White blood cell count 8.8, hematocrit 32.6, platelet count 356.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 102, bicarbonate 25, BUN 23, creatinine 0.6, glucose 138.
Regular insulin sliding scale for blood sugar 150 to 200 give 3 units subcutaneous, for blood sugar 201 to 250 give 6 units subcutaneous, for blood sugar 251 to 300 give 9 units subcutaneous, for blood sugar 301 to 350 give 12 units subcutaneous.
