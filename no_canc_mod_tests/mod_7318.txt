Her multiple sclerosis has also resulted in the loss of gag reflex with increasing difficulty swallowing and a baseline very hoarse voice although she has had no documentation of aspiration pneumonia.
Pulmonary was consulted to assess her shortness of breath on [**12-14**] and electrocardiogram was ordered and read as normal.
Pulmonary requested pulmonary function tests which were done and were found to be within normal limits.
FVC was 90%, FEV 1 of 97%, FEV 1/FVC 108%, total lung capacity of 91% and DLCO corrected for lung volumes of 80% which were read as low normal.
A computerized tomography scan was ordered to assess for pulmonary emboli and was read as low probability.
Lower extremity noninvasive studies were read as negative for deep vein thrombosis.
Cardiac echocardiogram showed no significant abnormality and arterial blood gases taken with readings of 7.37 pH, pCO2 of 36 and pO2 of 73 on room air.
The patient then underwent a chest computerized tomography scan and was found to have evidence of severe tracheomalacia with narrowing of the trachea and main stem bronchi to a near crescent with partial collapse on inspiration.
In addition the patient was found to have acute renal failure with a rise in creatinine from a baseline of .8 to 1.0 to a peak recorded value of 1.6 in the hospitalization on [**2143-12-23**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is significant for multiple sclerosis, diabetes Type 1, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea for which she does not use CPAP, saddle pulmonary emboli in [**2136**] in the setting of hospitalization and deep vein thrombosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission 99.8 temperature, blood pressure 140/80, heartrate in the 90s, respiratory rate 16, 99% on room air, fasting.
Blood sugars were recorded at 120 to 200.
Respiratory, clear to auscultation bilaterally with mild upper airway noises.
Abdomen, obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values on transfer to Medicine revealed white blood cell count of 19.1, hematocrit 30.7, platelets 224, INR 1.5, sodium 133, potassium 5.4, chloride 106, carbon dioxide 23, BUN 58, creatinine 1.5, glucose 141, calcium 8.3, magnesium 2.6, phosphate 3.5.
Urinalysis had 100 mg/dl of protein, otherwise clear.
Tracheomalacia was found incidentally on computerized tomography scan as well as a mild respiratory muscle weakness.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Over the course of the hospitalization the patient had a recent drop in sodium and increase in potassium.
The patient was given fluids and her creatinine promptly responded dropping to less than 1.2 by the time of discharge.
Pulmonary - Emboli, this patient is maintained on Coumadin with goal INR of 2. to 2.5.
