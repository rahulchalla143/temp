Bilateral fluid levels at the occipital ventricular horns, suggesting intraventricular hemorrhage.
Questionably increased lactate is noted in a few voxels IMPRESSION: Limited study due to motion.
A wet read was delivered at the time of image acquisition.
Brief Hospital Course: 61yoM with hep C cirrhosis complicated with portal vein thrombosis on coumadin, known grade 1 varices, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy in past, previously on wait list for combined liver/kidney [**Month/Day (4) **] with MELD 29, CKD from diabetic nephrosclerosis, and DM2 is admitted with confusion for 10 days now with persistent ams.
A lumbar puncture was performed which was unrevealing.
Multiple MRIs were performed which showed restricted diffusion in b/l cortices most consistent with hypoxic brain injury.
A repeat lumbar was performed to rule out both CMV, in addition to prion disease.
Due to the small volume only CMV PCR was sent which was negative.
A Video EEG did not show any seizure activity.
He was intermittently given small boluses of D5 with careful monitoring to avoid rapidly correcting his sodium levels.
His free water flushes were increased and his lactulose was decreased to keep his volume adequate.
Initial oxygen saturations remained stable in the high 90s.
Chest xray was suggestive of lung collapse which was attributed to mucous plugging.
The patient's saturations began to decrease despite face oxygen.
Breath sounds and heart absent.
