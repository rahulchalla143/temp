Pertinent Results: LABS and IMAGING  CT w/o contrast on 11/ 19: Stable appearance to the 22 x 11 mm pontine hemorrhage.
NCHCT on 11/ 22: stable 22 x 11 mm pons hemorrhage, periventricular ischemia and small lacunar infarcts.

There is associated mild edema that is unchanged from prior examination from  [**2176-11-2**].
A mini BAL on 11/ 23 was negative.
Finally, on 11/ 29:  Cx was suggestive of aspiration PNA on 11/ 29.

She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and blood pressure control.
A mini BAL on 11/ 23 was negative.
Her atenolol was switched to metoprolol and lisinopril was started and titrated for blood pressure control.
Pt's hematocrit was slowly downtrending so an abdominal CT was obtained on [**11-11**] which was negative for hematoma and the Hct the following day was stable (29.0 from 28.0).
