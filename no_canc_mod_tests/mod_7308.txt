Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with stent placement to L cirucmflex artery and rescue of jailed OM.
Pain was on both sides of chest and pt believes it may have been associated with some shorntess of breath.
LCx was stented but this resulted in OM jailing.
Wedge 25, pt became hypoxic eventually oxygenating only 87-89 on NRB; initial ABG 7.36/56/40.
-Stress [**12-27**]: 11 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol.
The heart rate rose from 51 to 85.
The blood pressure rose from 176/80 to 190/80.
Nuclear images showed no perfusion abnormality.
LVEF was 63%.
s/p venous stripping 4 Pulmonary fibrosis, baseline sat 92 on RA.
P 80 BP 145/56 RR 27 O2 89 on NRB after lasix and metoprolol T 98.6 P 63 BP 126/56 R 24 O2 94 on 3.5 NC.
An obese Russian gentleman, pleasant, Russian speaking, tired but able to speak in full sentences.

Resting hemodynamics revealed elevation of right and left sided filling pressures with RA mean of 13mmHG and PCWP of 25mmHG.
The systemic blood pressure was normal.
ABG revealed severe hypoxia at the end of the case which responded to lasix and IV nitro without necessitating intubation.
His wedge pressure elevated during the procedure and the post cath course complicated by hypoxia (blood gas 7.36/40/56) requiring non-rebreather therapy.
Post cath EKG revealed resolution of the ischemic changes, his cardiac enzymes peaked later that afternoon (CK 1399 MB 13.7 Trop T 2.87).
Post cath revealed preserved LV systolic function and preserved RV function with no wall motion abnormalities in either ventricle.
The patient remained chest pain free and hemodynamically stable after his catheterization and his cardiac enzymes trended downward.
Post cath echo reveals preserved LV and RV function.
Issues and plan from this hospitalization:  1) Cardiovascular, STEMI s/p cath, elevated wedge pressure a) Perfusion--STEMI (deep ST depressions in precordial leads STE in aVR) s/p cath to LCx (99% lesion) c OM1 rescue (70% residual stenosis) -ASA, plavix, -Pt started metoprolol which was changed to Toprol XL on discharge, also restarted felopidine in hospital.
-Pt to continue lisinopril, discontinued hydrocholorothiazide b) Pump, last EF 63%, repeat echo revealed preserved RV and LV funcion with no wall motion abnormalities.
You should also have your blood count and chemistries monitored 2 days after your discharge.
