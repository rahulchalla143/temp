Small right pleural effusion is noted, slightly increased since the prior study but still small.
Air-fluid levels are seen in the upright film, but the majority of these appear to be within the colon.
[**2112-5-16**] CT Abd Pelvis, non-contrast: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 77yo F w/hx of CAD, CHF, PVD, DM2, afib who presents as a transfer from an OSH for evaluation of abdominal pain and mesenteric ischemia.
On admission, GI and [**Month/Day/Year **] surgery were consulted.
Her INR was elevated and she was given FFP with plans for EGD/Colonoscopy to further evaluate her symptoms.
Her INR was still therapeutic and this procedure was deferred.
She began to c/o increased abdominal distention; abdominal xray revealed likely ileus; she was made NPO.
On HD8/POD4, [**2112-5-16**] noncontrast CT abd/pelvis was done, which showed findings compatible with anasarca, with diffuse soft tissue stranding/edema, marked bilateral effusions, and free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis, but no specific evidence of bowel ischemia, pneumotosis, free air, or obstruction.
She was then transferred back to the medicine team for further evaluation and treatment.
Medicine Team Updated Hospital Course: Upon transfer, Ms. [**Known lastname 6185**] had evidence of pulmonary edema and active heart failure based on symptoms and CXR findings.
As symptoms resolved, it was felt that EGD and colonoscopy were not indicated given risks associated with procedure.
Weight on discharge was 40.1kg.
Patient should be weighed daily and if weight is increased > 3lbs, her primary care doctor should be notified and Lasix dose adjusted.
Losartan was started for heart failure management and she was given 12.5mg PO qday as tolerated by her blood pressure.
It was restarted on [**2112-5-22**] at a dose of 2mg PO qday but INR was still subtherapeutic at 1.3 on discharge.
She was discharged on Coumadin 4mg PO qday with a Lovenox bridge until INR is therapeutic.
She should have INR checked in 2 days and Coumadin dose adjusted if elevated.
Lovenox should be stopped when INR is > 2.0.
Bowel: KUB was consistent with ileus which is resolving.
Enoxaparin 30 mg/0.3 mL Syringe Sig: Thirty (30) mg Subcutaneous [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day): Stop this medication when INR is > 2.0.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR every 2 days until it is stable and if > 2.0, stop Lovenox.
Plesae maintain INR between [**1-12**] and adjust coumadin as necessary.
Please check electrolytes and renal function in 2 days and after this as needed.
Isosorbide Mononitrate 30 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily): please give only if BP > 100.
Weight Please check daily weight and call PCP if weight is > 3lbs.
Weight on discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] is 40.1kg.
