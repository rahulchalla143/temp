When seen in the ED, she was chest pain free and blood pressure was 150/77.
Sats were 92-94% on RA.
While returning she became diaphoretic and was noted to have SBP 270/140.
EKG revealed ST elevations in anterior precordial leads.
Trop/CK/MB was 0.10/112/3 initially, and repeat values were 0.8/102/pending.
She was started on NRB, with sats in high 90s with crackles on lung exam and JVP 8 cm, and given lasix to which she put out 2+L of urine.
Echo performed showed no RV strain, and symmetric wall hypertrophy without focal motion abnormalities.
Also notable on admission was a Hct of 25 (pt has history of anemia (Fe def and CRI) with baseline Hct 26 - 28), and a Cr of 2.5 (baseline 1.7 - 2.0).
Pt was then admitted to CCU for hypertensive emergency given SBP 260s and ST elev V2-V4.

Pt was placed on labetalol gtt, cardiac enzymes with peak trop of 0.10 (prev baseline 0.05), CK and MB flat.
SBP improved to 150s-170s, and were in 120s on day of discharge.
Given her EKG changes with hypertension, she will need a stress test in the near future, when her BP is better controlled.
For evaluation of her chronic renal insufficiency, pt has had renal biopsy in the past consistent with diabetic nephropathy.
Cr remained stable at 2.5, thought possibly due to progression of disease.
4. anemia: Pt has had chronic (microcytic) anemia with baseline Hct 24-28, and was anemic on admission with Hct 25.
Pt was guaiac negative in ED.
Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
