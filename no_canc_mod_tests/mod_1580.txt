TWI V2-V3; V4-V6 ST Depressions .
Low blood pressure suspected secondary to volume depletion in setting of decreased PO's and UTI.
Arterial line was placed for blood pressure monitoring and this revealed stable blood pressures in the 90's-100's after IVFs.
In terms of other possible etiologies of her hypotension, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim was performed which showed normal adrenal reserve.
Blood cultures were sent and revealed no growth.
Urinalysis was positive ([**11-23**] WBC, mod bacteria) and she was treated with a 3 day course of bactrim.
ECHO demonstrated no new WMA, low EF or valvular dx, and her troponins subsequently trended down (see below).
EKG with lateral ST depressions.
Cardiac enzymes cycled, and troponin trended down over next 24 hours.
Repeat EKG demonstrated normalization of ST changes.
ECHO performed and demonstrated no wall motion abnormalities and normal EF.
Recommend stress test to evaluate for underlying CAD.
