HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was found to have an acute myocardial infarction and agreed to go to the Cardiac Catheterization Suite and was found to have multi-vessel coronary artery disease and moderate aortic stenosis.
After careful consideration and given that she had a recent non-Q wave myocardial infarction, along with the catheterization findings the patient, after informed consent was obtained, decided to pursue an operative repair of these problems.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained immediately postoperative which showed her ventricle to have some apical hypokinesia and inadequate filling.
The patient then was given volume and her blood pressure was maintained using alpha agents.
Postoperatively, the patient was noted to have peak inspiratory pressures and was believed to have abdominal compartment syndrome.
She was then taken back to the Operating Room where she underwent an exploratory laparotomy.
She had drainage of ascites and placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain.
She intermittently required Dopamine for heart rate control as she tended to be bradycardic and Neo-Synephrine was used to maintain her blood pressure.
As her blood pressure increased and Neo-Synephrine was weaned off, she was started on Lasix.
Her voice was hoarse, but overall her saturations were in the 90s on a face mask with an FIO2 of 0.4%.
On [**12-6**], postoperative day eight from the exploratory laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome, postoperative day six from abdominal wall closure, she had several self-limiting runs of ventricular tachycardia, approximately six to eight beats long, with minimum decrease in her blood pressure and shortly thereafter was seen on the evening rounds after having labs sent off and was noted to have a decrease in her blood pressure significantly, dropped approximately 20 pounds, and continued in a ventricular tachycardia.
When her blood pressure dropped she had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed good right ventricular and left ventricular filling and then shortly thereafter she went in to ventricular tachycardia and had a full code performed.
Her chest was then opened, wires were cut, and after having several episodes of attempts at electro-cardioversion, externally, she had the internal lead paddles placed and was attempted internal cardioversion.
She was able to generate a paced rhythm for a blood pressure of 90/60.
