O2 sats were in the 80s, HR was 130s and BP 105/60 (MD signout suggested he was intubated for agitated).
His vent settings were TV 700, RR 20, FIO2 60%.
During transfer his SBPs dropped to the 60s ?
He was given 150 mg of amiodarone, 5 amps of bicarb, 1 mg of epi and an intraosseous IV was placed.
Upon arrival here the patient was tachycardic and in significant respiratory distress with RR in the mid 40s, HR in the 120s-130s and sats 100% on the vent.

Workup revealed positive ASO titers and Beta-strep from LE wound.
CT of lower extremities showed evidence of osteomyelitic changes (could be chronic).
Other imaging limited by his size and mental status.
He was not stable enough for imaging, and died before further evaluation could be undertaken.
CXR showed increased interstitial markings.
