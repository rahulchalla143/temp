Fifteen days after initial presentation, the patient was noted to be short of breath and tachypneic, with oxygen saturations in the 80s.
A CT angio showed no evidence for pulmonary embolus, but did show a large left loculated pleural effusion and a smaller right pleural effusion.
After the drainage, chest x-ray showed reinflation of the left lung, with improved oxygenation, 97 to 99% on 4 liters nasal cannula.

Echocardiogram obtained four days after initial presentation showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60 to 70%, with only mild mitral regurgitation and mild dilation of the left atrium.
The patient's TSH came back mildly elevated at 6, and her thyroid supplementation was increased.
Electrocardiogram was normal when compared to a prior study, and showed no acute ischemic changes.
