CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: A 15 x 12 mm roughly demarcated area of hypoattenuation is identified in the right parietal lobe involving the right centrum semiovale, which extends to the cortex.
PERFUSION IMAGING: There is increased mean transit time throughout the right cerebral hemisphere with corresponding decreased blood flow but no significant blood volume abnormality, which is concerning for a large area of penumbra.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK: The right internal carotid artery shows an acute dissection extending from the upper pole of the right common carotid artery bifurcation to the level of the intracranial internal carotid with an associated filling defect in the right carotid canal.
Repeat CTA head and neck/CTP brain: Final Report INDICATION: 47-year-old male with right internal carotid artery dissection and concern for evolving CVA now with complete left hemiplegia, here to evaluate for interval changes.
COMPARISON: CT cerebral perfusion study last performed on [**2174-3-17**] at 16:23 p.m. .
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a persistent area of hypoattenuation in the right parietal lobe and centrum semiovale extending to the cortex.
The cerebral sulci, ventricles and extra-axial CSF-containing spaces are normal in size and configuration.
PERFUSION IMAGING: There is a vague area of persistent slightly increased mean transit time in the right cerebral hemisphere when compared to the left hemisphere.
The blood volume and blood flow appears symmetric bilaterally.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK: An intimal flap is again noted in the right internal carotid artery extending from the level of the right common carotid artery bifurcation to the terminus of the intracranial internal carotid, consistent with acute internal carotid dissection.
Minimally improved cerebral perfusion with persistent slightly increased mean transit time in the right cerebral hemisphere but symmetric blood volume and flow as compared to the left hemisphere.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Regional left ventricular systolic function is normal.
Global left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF=55%).
Cardiac size is top normal, is accentuated by the low lung volumes.
LABS AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: [**2174-3-21**] 05:30AM BLOOD WBC-8.2 RBC-5.65 Hgb-15.0 Hct-47.2 MCV-84 MCH-26.5* MCHC-31.7 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-344 [**2174-3-21**] 05:30AM BLOOD Glucose-110* UreaN-12 Creat-0.8 Na-138 K-3.9 Cl-104 HCO3-21* AnGap-17 [**2174-3-21**] 05:30AM BLOOD Calcium-9.2 Phos-4.0 Mg-1.9  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 47 year old right-handed male with HTN, HL, DM2, tobacco use, who presented with L hemisensory loss and hemiparesis, with L neglect and extinction, found to have R hemispheric stroke in the setting of R terminal ICA occlusion/dissection.
Neurological exam initially showed dysarthria and left neglect as well as left hemibody sensory loss with visual and tactile extinction.
The patient's neuro motor exam worsened overnight while he was in the ICU on the night of admission.
Originally the exam was significant for L face, arm and leg weakness in upper motor neuron pattern but was still antigravity in proximal muscles and full strength in the hand and ankle.
The intial NCHCT shows small area of R parietal hypodensity, and CT perfusion showed very large entire R MCA territory penumbra.
The patient's blood pressure was maintained above SBP 140 with IVF to avoid hypoperfusoin, at times the patient had SBP>180 so he was given hydralazine 10mg IV PRN and responded well to this.
The patient was placed on a heparin gtt with goal PTT 50-70, and was eventually started on coumadin with goal INR [**12-31**].
His stroke risk factors were assessed, and HgbA1c was 8, TG 218, HDL 25, LDL 78.
#Nutrition: Initially patient was seen by speech and swallow evaluation and was cleared for ground dysphagia diet and thin liquids.
On repeat evaluation the patient was cleared for regular solids and thin liquids (cardiac/diabetic diet).
#Diarrhea: Patient had one large BM with some diarrhea on [**3-21**], a CDiff PCR was sent and was negative.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) Restart full dose lisinopril 20mg QD when able 2) Patient will need uptitration of his metformin as he was on 500mg [**Hospital1 **]) and his HBa1c was at 8 (this will need to be discussed with PCP) 3) Continued bridging with heparin gtt and Coumadin.
INR was subtherapeutic at 1.2 on last check, with dosing of 5 of coumadin.
9. heparin (porcine) in D5W 25,000 unit/250 mL Parenteral Solution Sig: 1400 (1400) units/hr Intravenous ASDIR (AS DIRECTED): titrate to goal PTT 50-70.
Will stop after 24 hours of goal INR [**12-31**] when reached on Coumadin.
Neuro Exam at Time of Discharge: Mental Status: * Degree of Alertness: Alert.
We made the following changes to your medications: START Heparin IV (this will be dosed at your Long Term Care Facility and discontinued after you are thereapeutic - with an INR of [**12-31**] - on your coumadin for at least 24 hours) START Coumadin (Warfarin) take 5mg tablet by mouth once daily at 4:00pm START Senna 8.6mg tablet take one tablet by mouth up to two times daily as needed for constipation START Docusate 100mg take one tablet by mouth twice a day to soften stool DECREASED Lisinopril 10mg take one tablet by mouth daily STOPPED Meloxicam STOPPED Oxycodone  It was a pleasure taking care of you.
