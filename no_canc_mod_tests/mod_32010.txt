[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The maximum pressure gradient across the mitral valve is 4 mm Hg with a mean of 2 mm Hg at a cardiac output of about 4.5 l/m.
