His head was scanned and revealed a "Massive Head Bleed, without midline shift".
On Discharge: AOx3, moving all extremities, ambulating in [**Doctor Last Name **] with assistance  Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission([**11-24**]): 138  101  15  184 -------------/ 3.5  22  0.9 estGFR: >75 (click for details) CK: 175  MB: Pnd  Ca: 8.4 Mg: 2.1 P: 3.1  ALT: 14 AP: 62 Tbili: 0.7 Alb: 4.6 AST: 28 LDH:  Dbili:  TProt: [**Doctor First Name **]:  Lip: 26  Serum ASA, EtOH, Acetmnphn, Benzo, Barb, Tricyc:  Urine Benzos: Pos Urine Barbs, Opiates, Cocaine, Amphet, Mthdne: Negative  WBC:20.6  Hgb:12.9  Plt:242 Hct:35.9  N:92.2 L:3.5 M:4.0 E:0.2 Bas:0.1  PT: 14.5  PTT: 23.0  INR: 1.3  Imaging: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT [**11-24**]: There is a large amount of acute hemorrhage centered at the level of the mid brain with blood filling the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles.
Dilatation of the ventricles and transependymal migration of CSF is consistent with obstructive hydrocephalus.
Ethmoidal, maxillary, and sphenoidal mucosal thickening is mild.
CXR [**11-24**]: FINDINGS: There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is approximately 2.4 cm above the level of the carina.
MRI Head +/- [**11-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Repeat evaluation can be considered after evacuation or resolution of the hematoma.
Given the presence of intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage, patient needs further evaluation to exclude a vascular cause like an aneurysm by CT angiogram.
CTA Head [**11-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Persistent disproportionate and cystic-appearing dilatation of the 3rd ventricle (despite presence of lateral ventriculostomy) which may, effectively, be "trapped."
CT Sinus [**11-27**]: IMPRESSION: Panmucosal thickening within the paranasal sinuses, increased compared to the CT of [**2146-11-24**].
Left frontal ventricular catheter appears to terminate in brain parenchyma as discussed on concurrent head CT.  Head CT [**11-27**]: FINDINGS: A ventricular catheter entering from a left frontal approach appears to terminate within the left frontal lobe (2:13).
The left lateral ventricle remains extremely dilated but not significantly changed compared to the examination two days prior.
MRI [**12-1**]: FINDINGS: There has been a reduction in the volume of hemorrhage present within the bodies of the lateral ventricles.
HeadCT IMPRESSION [**12-1**]: 1.
Head CT [**12-4**]:IMPRESSION: 1.
His exam post drain did improve and MRI showed no obvious mass.
CT showed with decrease in size of IVH and stable ICPs.
CTA of head was done showed no AVM, however bleeding was likely due to arachnoid cyst.
On [**12-1**], he was again taken to the OR for endoscopic cyst aspiration and Rickham catheter placement.
On his examination on [**12-6**], he was found to have gross visual field deficits and ophthalmology was consulted.
On [**12-22**] his sodium was improving and the salt tabs were decreased.
They were decreased again on [**12-23**] and his fluid restriction was liberalized.
?You will need an MRI scan of the brain with/without contrast.
