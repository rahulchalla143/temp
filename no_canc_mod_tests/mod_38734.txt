# GI Bleed Patient was evaluated by GI and underwent a EGD which revealed diffusely eroded edematous gastric mucosa with central black membranes v. clot in the fundus but no definitive bleeding site.
He had erosive esophagitis, esophageal/gastric/duodenal ulcers to the 3rd part of duodenum, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Tear.
Gastrin levels were normal.
No blasts were seen in his WBC differential, but there were bands at the outside hospital, and the elevated counts were attributed a possible infection v. pancreatitis.
They felt his case was not entirely clear as the smear was made on a post-transfusion blood, which may have been the etiology of the schistocytes.
The platelet count rose, permitting repeat EGD w/ biopsy, and the haptoglobin rose to within normal counts.
An HIV Ab test is pending at time of discharge and will be followed up at his hematology follow-up appointment next week with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
