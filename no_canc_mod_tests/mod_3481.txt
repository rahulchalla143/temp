Admission Date:  [**2200-8-7**]       Discharge Date: [**2200-8-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2124-7-27**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old female who fell down two stairs in a witnessed fall and landed on her right-hand side and struck the right side of her head and was transferred to [**Hospital3 2063**] where a computerized axial tomography scan showed a right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 95.6, heartrate 80, blood pressure 175/76 and respirations 18, sating 99% on 2 liters per minute.
She had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of 15 and pupils were 3 mm and reactive.
Heart was irregularly irregular and the rate was well controlled.
Vascular examination was negative.
Distal pulses and sensation was intact in all extremities.
LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory data work was significant for a hematocrit of 38.5, the patient's urinalysis was normal.
INR was 3.1.
Her BUN and creatinine were 31 and 1.4 and her glucose was 277.
Initial radiology showed chest x-ray normal.
Cervical spine series revealed no fracture, no dislocation and the pelvic AP revealed a right intertrochanteric femur fracture.
Computerized tomography scan of the head repeated again showed a right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Orthopedics, Cardiology and Neurosurgery were all consulted regarding the risks of anticoagulating the patient and expanding her subarachnoid hemorrhage, versus leaving her on unanticoagulated and putting her at risk for valve leaflet thrombosis and embolization as a result of her atrial fibrillation.
Serial head computerized tomography scans up to this point had revealed an unchanged subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Postoperatively the patient exhibited some confusion and magnetic resonance imaging scan/magnetic resonance angiography was obtained that revealed no new hemorrhage, although it was difficult to rule out an embolic event.
An abdominal computerized tomography scan was performed to rule out any abdominal bleed.
Now that serial hematocrits have been stable and the patient's diarrhea has had good resolution with p.o.
