Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat showed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pulmonary examination showed diffuse wheezing, rhonchi audible without stethoscope.
Cardiovascular examination revealed she was tachycardic and with muffled heart sounds (difficult to appreciate heart sounds secondary to loud breathing).

On the second Medical Intensive Care Unit day, the patient was extubated at 11 a.m.   Post extubation arterial blood gas was 7.38/45/136.
During this time, her sputum culture grew out Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to levofloxacin.
