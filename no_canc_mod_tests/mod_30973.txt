STUDIES [**2173-11-13**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No hemorrhage, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures.
[**11-13**] CXR FINDINGS: There has been interval replacement of previous tunneled dialysis catheter with a new catheter now from a right subclavian approach in standard placement.
Lung volumes are mildly diminished.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
[**11-15**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-14**], the area of increased opacification at the left base is somewhat less prominent on the current study, though there is some blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with pleural fluid.
Course complicate by poor glucose control and blood pressure control.
On initial exam by neurology, the patient had intact brainstem reflexes, but was not withdrawing to painful stimuli.
Head CT was negative for bleed, toxic-metabolic work-up revealed that LFTs were normal, lactate was normal, glucose was normal, tox screen was negative, and U/A suggested UTI with urine cultures growing citrobacter.
The patient was initially treated for 4 days with ceftriaxone, then received 1 dose meropenem 10/31 per sensitivity results of urine culture (see culture results), but given that meropenem may reduce the seizure threshold she was switched to tobramycin, which was dosed with HD (completed 7 day course of appropriate coverage on [**2173-11-23**]).
Although her MS has been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], she has never been at her [**Doctor Last Name 5348**] MS after the seizure.
In addition to the toxic-metabolic work up described above, Vit B12, RPR and TSH were all checked and were [**Doctor Last Name 19109**].
Her blood sugars have varied widely and she had one episode where she was briefly unresponsive due to hypoglycemia.
On [**11-22**] she "triggered" for unresponsiveness with a FS of 34.
This was likely due to a series of medication errors as she received 3 u lantus both the night of [**11-21**] and the am of [**11-22**] (medication error by crosscovering intern), and also the RN gave insulin that day based on a scale for a FS of 273 instead of the actual FS value of 235).
HTN - The patient's HCTZ was discontinued and her metoprolol was gradually titrated up to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] as she was persistently hypertensive to SBPs in 170s, occasionally requiring IV hydralizine.
(She triggered once for a SBP of 210/120 and 1x emesis once on the floors on a morning before dialysis).
Her BP has been stable over the past several days, ranging from 92-100/54-82 over [**2173-11-25**].
She was afebrile, had [**Male First Name (un) **] leukocytosis and test for c. diff toxin was negative.
Her abdominal exam remained unremarkable.
Her HCT was monitored and remained stable and she remained hemodynamically stable during this time.
It is recommended that her PCP monitor this and determine whether further work up with a colonoscopy is warranted at her follow up visit .
It is recommended that once her MS improves she have a repeat speech and swallow evaluation as she may be able to be advanced further with increased alertness and attention.
