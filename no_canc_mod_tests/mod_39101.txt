Microbiology: - [**7-16**] Stool C-diff: Negative - [**7-9**] MRSA screen: Negative - [**7-7**] Urine culture: Negative - [**7-6**] R arm abscess: Sparse pansensitive S. Aureus, K. Pneumoniae - [**7-2**] Blood culture: Negative - [**6-29**] Blood culture: E. Coli .
Radiology: Renal US [**6-29**]:  Limited examination with no evidence of gross hydronephrosis.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**6-29**]: 1.
Single pelvic kidney, which demonstrates a lobular contour with multiple hypodense an mild hyperdense lesions with no definite evidence of hydronephrosis.
CT Head [**6-30**]:  No acute intracranial process.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**7-1**]: 1.
MRA Head [**7-1**]: There is evidence of vascular flow in both internal carotids, however both middle cerebral arteries appears thin, given the clinical history vasospasm cannot be completely excluded, correlation with followup MRI or CTA are recommended if clinically warranted.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**7-1**]: Tethered cord with myelomeningocele as described above, single pelvic kidney and absence of the uterus.
CT Head [**7-6**]:  No acute intracranial process.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**7-13**]: No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction.
Neurology: EEG [**7-9**]: This video EEG telemetry began with the patient in electrographic status epilepticus, which appeared to be non-convulsive in nature based on review of the video, although some left thumb twitching was noted.
EEG [**7-10**] to [**7-15**]: These exams illustrated interval improvement from EEG on [**7-9**] with decreased evidence for seizure activities.
The last exam report are as listed here: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
#) Acidosis: The patient presented initially with significant metabolic acidosis with pH 7.18 at [**Hospital3 6592**], pCO2 8, and pO2 of 150.
Anion gap is 20.
#) Bacteremia: The patient started growing out E. Coli in [**1-21**] blood culture bottles resistant to bactrim, ampicillin and cipro, and on initial presentation also had a profound leukocytosis.
A CT of her head showed no evidence of acute bleed and an MRI was obtained that showed evidence of a meningomyelocele at the L5 region but no evidence of temporal lobe enhancement.
Neurology was consulted, who also recommended a lumbar puncture; however this was not obtained as the patient's mother declined consent.
As such, the patient could not be ruled out for meningitis, however a urine tox screen came back positive for cocaine.
An EEG was obtained, which showed no further seizure activity and the patient was extubated without difficulty.
Initial creatinine was greater than 8, which improved with IV fluids.
Renal ultrasound was negative for hydronephrosis, and the patient was able to urinate, albeit was incontinent of urine.
With aggressive hydration, the patient's creatinine improved to 2.6 by the time of transfer from the ICU.
B12 and folate were normal, and iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Her cocaine toxicology screen came back positive.
An ultrasound of the area to look for abscess was ordered and was performed after transfer to the medicine floor.
STAT head CT was negative, and 20-minute EEG study showed non-specific findings suggestive of encephalitis.
24-hour EEG study was ordered; once leads were connected, it became apparent that the patient was in non-convulsive status epilepticus.
Creatinine also stabilized at 2-2.3. .
This study revealed abscess of earlier hematoma.
She was noted to have urine leaking out of her fistula, and bladder scan showed > 800 cc.
Her dilatin level was found to be low at 2.2 so she was reloaded with an additional 1gm IV and started on 100mg TID of dilantin.
A VBG showed:  7.26/42/40/20 consistent with poorly compensated metabolic acidosis.
She will have her electrolytes monitored within one week of discharge.
Her physical exam was benign.
Her sodium bicarbonate was decreased as bloating may have contributed to her discomfort.
This was stopped [**7-16**] and her potassium remained stable on [**7-17**].
She will have her electrolytes monitored one week after discharge.
Her electrolytes will be followed by her new Nephrologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 30217**] [**Name (STitle) 28760**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Her creatinine continued to hover around 2.1-2.3 during the rest of her stay.
#) History of substance abuse:  Her urine toxicology was only positive for methadone.
TFTs showed an elevated TSH at 24 with a normal free T4.
