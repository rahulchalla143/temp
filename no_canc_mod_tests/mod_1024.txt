CXR ([**2129-4-6**]): CHF and effusion with slight interval worsening.
ECHO ([**2129-4-7**]): The left atrium is dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-9-14**], the mitral regurgitation is somewhat reduced.
CAROTID US ([**2129-4-8**]): 60-69% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries; however, this estimate of percentage of stenosis may not be precise due to a generalized increase in systolic velocities in the bilateral common and internal carotid arteries.
CT CHEST ([**2129-4-9**]): Interval worsening of right lower lobe opacity, and development of hazy lingular opacity, likely representing infiltrates, with adjacent pleural thickening.
Presented with chest pains which were concerning but in the setting of persistent nontypical pain, this was thought to be likely secondary to other causes.
Did have CK and troponin elevations, but has chronic troponin elevations.
His beta-blocker was initially held in the setting of bradycardia, but this was started after stabilitization of his rhythm and dialysis.
Pneumonia: Found to have RLL opacity on CXR with leukocytosis and cough.
A CT was performed which showed "Interval worsening of right lower lobe opacity, and development of hazy lingular opacity, likely representing infiltrates, with adjacent pleural thickening."
Upon discussion with radiology, it was recommended that an outpatient PET scan be obtained (to evaluate for possible malignant process).
Furosemide listed as outpatient medication on last OMR note, but not taking as outpatient.
Chest pain: Potential causes include angina, esophageal irritation, anxiety among other causes of atypical chest pains.
