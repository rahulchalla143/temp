He had a NCHCT that did not reveal intracranial bleed.
I arrived 5 mins later and we planned for a CT perfusion as well as CTA.
Given his renal failure, the dialysis fellow was called prior to administering iv contrast which accounted for some of the delay, such that the CT scan was performed at 4 am and completed at 4h30.
His last dialysis was Fri [**1-27**], a few hours prior to presentation.

The blood volume in this location is mostly preserved, indicating that this is potentially a reversible defect.
However, the non-contrast CT scan suggests low density and swelling in the left MCA territory, which would imply a completed infarct.
The CT angiogram demonstrates occlusion of the left vertebral artery in its cervical course.
MRI HEAD: FINDINGS: The MR findings are similar to those displayed on the prior CT scan.
The MRA examination demonstrates an abrupt cutoff of the superior division of the left MCA with a faint tapering that suggests a meniscus and a likely intraluminal filling defect.
CXR In comparison with the study of [**2-11**], allowing for differences in position of the patient, there is little overall change.
