CXR [**2115-5-22**]:  UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST: Mildl enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is chronic.
MICRO: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2115-5-25**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2115-5-26**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2115-5-25**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2115-5-23**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
**FINAL REPORT [**2115-5-28**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2115-5-28**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
AXR [**2115-5-25**]: HISTORY: 87-year-old man with sepsis, recovering, but more distended with diarrhea, evaluate for colonic distention.
TECHNIQUE: A supine abdominal x-ray dated [**2115-5-25**] at 11:15 a.m. was obtained.
Comparison is made to a prior CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2115-3-24**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT abdomen/pelvis with oral contrast [**2115-5-26**]: CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: In the visualized lung bases, there are new small bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right.
Evaluation of the collapsed bladder is limited, but no gross abnormality is identified.
CXR [**2115-5-26**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-23**] and 31.
Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion accompanied by small increasing right pleural effusion suggests that the basal predominant opacification in the lungs is due to pulmonary edema and not pneumonia.
TTE [**2115-5-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.
His donepezil was discontinued and his heart rate normalized to the 60s.
On the evening of transfer back to the floor on [**2115-5-26**], the patient again became febrile to 101.9 with SBP in the 70s.
Continued to hold BP meds.
Repeat CXR showed a possible new LLL PNA, however subsequent CXR relayed that this was more likely effusion/atelectasis in the LLL.
Given his abdominal distension and diarrhea, CT abdomen/pelvis was performed.
C diff was negative x 3 and stool cultures were negative.
Repeat UA still appeared dirty so urine culture was again sent but was negative.
Repeat blood cultures were negative.
TTE on [**5-28**] showed no vegetations and EF of 55%.
Once transferred back to the floor, the pt continued to have pauses up to 2 seconds and HR in the 50s.
He would also have bursts of HR up to 120s.
Na was 139 at discharge.
Given staph aureus in the urine, blood cultures were checked but were negative.
Initially was treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Zosyn, but tailored down to bactrim based on urine sensitivities.
As per above, once pt was hypotensive again, his antibiotics were again changed back to Vanc/Cefepime/flagyl and UA/urine culture were repeated.
# Pulmonary edema: Pt had noted edema on CXR on [**2115-5-26**] after 4 L NS fluid resuscitation.
Oxygen saturation remained mid 90s on room air.
TTE on [**2115-5-28**] showed normal EF at 55%.
On day of discharge [**5-29**], pt had increased wheezing and crackles in his lungs on exam (still satting 98% RA), so given Lasix 10 mg IV x1.
As BP tolerates, pt may need some gentle diuresis after the aggressive fluid resuscitation he received here.
His creatinine improved with IVF to 0.9 at discharge.
# PEG tube replacement: Pts PEG tube fell out on [**2115-5-26**] after returning from CT scan.
# Leukopenia: WBC was lower at 3.5 on both [**5-28**] and [**5-29**].
Would repeat CBC on [**2115-6-1**] to ensure WBC is stable.
C diff was negative x 2.
Given persistent fevers/hypotension, CT abdomen/pelvis was performed on [**2115-5-26**].
Can consider restarting as BP remains stable (had been on 2.5 mg three times a day).
Your blood pressure dropped while you were here, requiring admission to the ICU.
Your blood pressure again dropped, and you were started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Your blood pressures have improved, and you have had no more fevers for over 48 hours.
Call your doctor or go to the ER for any worsening confusion, recurrent fevers, abdominal pain, vomiting, persistent diarrhea, or any other concerning symptoms.
