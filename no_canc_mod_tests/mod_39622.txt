FRONTAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: A right internal jugular central venous line terminates with the tip at the upper cavoatrial junction.
Lung volumes are low with resultant vascular crowding.
[**6-20**] CXR IMPRESSION No evidence of pneumonia.
[**6-25**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-20**], there is no interval change or evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Follow-up ERCP will allow for complete evaluation of intrahepatics given possibility of PSC.
Repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and complete evaluation of biliary tree.
The gallbladder is mildly distended, without wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.
This appearance could be seen with chronic fibrosis, although there are no other findings on this study to suggest cirrhosis.
The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and stomach are within normal limits.
[**6-28**] ECHO Findings LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Her leukocytosis persisted, LFTs remained elevated and she continued to spike fevers.
These were thought to be [**12-21**] underlying alcoholic hepatitis rather than infection, especially since only 1 bottle of many many blood culture samples was ever positive for bacterial growth, and thus was thought to be a lab contaminant.
?s INR was elevated to 1.6 on arrival at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Patient was hypotensive on admission with SBP 90s despite receiving significant IV fluids at OSH.
SBP improved to the 110s with IV fluids.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine 8.0 on admission to OSH, fell gradually during this admission, to 1.2 at discharge.
Maintained urine output in the context of aggressive IVF hydration as above.
Lactate was 1.2 at OSH and 2.3 here.
Resolved by time of discharge, with bicarb 24 and anion gap 10. .
# Anemia: Hct was 28.2 at OSH.
Her RBCs are macrocytic with MCV 104.
Hct was trended, iron panel, B12, and folate were checked.
Cultures all negative apart from a single spuriously-positive GPC blood culture.
WBC remained >15 after treatment with vancomycin.
