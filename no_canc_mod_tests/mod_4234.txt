The patient was initially referred to [**Hospital3 417**] ED [**2178-2-18**] from her primary care physician's office for evaluation of elevated LFTs, confusion, ARF (Cr 3.4), and hyponatremia (Na+ 124).
Baseline SBP 80s.
Exam was significant for pericardial rub, and echo showed a small-moderate effusion.
A TEE was not done due to concern for causing a variceal bleed.
EF was 60-65%.
Surveillance blood cultures were persistantly positive for MRSA, most recently [**2178-3-5**], despite therapeutic doses of vancomycin.
Abdominal U/S on [**2178-3-2**] showed hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and reversed flow in the portal vein.
On [**2178-3-4**] she had a urine culture that grew enterococcus.

MICRO: Urine culture with yeast.
Blood cultures Negative .
IMAGING: CXR: AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: There is a ill-defined opacity within the left lower lobe consistent with patient's known pneumonia in this region.
Abd Ultrasound: FINDINGS: This was a technically difficult examination and was performed portably.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
MRI Abdomen: FINDINGS: The liver is shrunken and nodular, consistent with the given history of cirrhosis.
A mild-moderate amount of ascites fluid is seen, primarily adjacent to the liver.
Cirrhosis w/acute hepatitis: Patient was admitted with likely EtOH cirrhosis given her known history and lab data (discriminate score >32).
ARF on CKD:  Her baseline creatinine was unknown but per report creatinine was 1.0 prior to initiation of gentamicin.
TEE was not done given concern for causing variceal bleed; however, EGD did not demonstrate varices.
Worsening LLL pneumonia on CXR at OSH could have been source of infection.
Multiple imaging studies were performed without clear source of infection (see above).
Hypotension: It was unclear what degree of hypotension this represented as patient's baseline SBP reported to be in the 80s.
Tachycardia/chest pain: Patient had an episode of A fib w/ RVR [**2178-3-15**]; likely [**3-6**] to fluid shifts w/ CVVHD and cardiac irritation from levophed.
Echo at OSH showed normal EF, LA slightly enlarged.
She was asymptomatic during event, cardiac enzymes were flat.
