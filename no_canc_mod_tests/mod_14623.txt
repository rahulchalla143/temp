She was bagged through air mask and immediately upon arrival to the hospital, she was incubated after receiving Etomidate 25 and Succinylchilne 125 and vecuronium 10mg.
After intubation patient  also received 10 mg of Verced at 1906pm, 4mg at 810pm and another vec 10mg at 815 prior to transfer to us.
Initial laboratory tests showed normal coag, normal CK, and negative serum tox screen.
However, CT head showed signs of edema and hypodense lesion in the right posterior frontal white matter.

FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2128-5-31**]):    NO GROWTH.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
Reports: [**2128-6-1**] Cardiology ECHO GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 3 iv injections of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline, at rest, with cough and post-Valsalva maneuver.
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2128-5-31**] Radiology CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid and vertebral arteries.
[**2128-5-31**] Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)   IMPRESSION: No abnormalities.
[**2128-5-28**] Cytology SPINAL FLUID [**2128-5-31**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Lymphocytes and monocytes  [**2128-5-28**] Neurophysiology EEG FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: There were frequent bursts of generalized delta slowing with a bifrontal emphasis.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: 1) MRI demonstrates T2 hyperintense abnormalities in the white matter of the cerebrum, which are nonspecific but may be areas of infarction.
2) MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates flow in the major branches of this circulation.
Her clinical exam was limited by the fact that the patient received high doses of paralytics prior to transfer.
Given the history of cancer and recent headaches the lesion seen an outside head CT was concerning for a metastasis vs. stroke.
On further review and in talking with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] appears that her breast CA was carcinoma in situ, removed completely with recent breast biopsy notable only for hyperplasia and not invasive CA.
Infectious workup was negative as was the tox screen.
An MRI was done with a lesion in the R parietal lobe most consistent with a previous thrombotic infarct.
A workup was initiated for stroke risk factors, including a carotid u/s that was negative for stenosis, a transthoracic echo that was negative for ASD, PFO, wall motion abnormalities, systolic dysfunction or clot (EF>55% and mild LVH, bubble study negative).
CRP was elevated above 4, though should be repeated as an outpatient as she was febrile the night prior to this blood draw.
Homocysteine level should also be checked, and perhaps a hypercoaguability workup as well if indicated.
She had no evidence of DVT or PE on exam or the studies performed during this admission.
She did have hypertension above her goal SBP of 130mmHg, and was thus started and maintained on lisinopril without side effects.
She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**], her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] well as Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the Neurology Resident following her while she was in the hospital.
