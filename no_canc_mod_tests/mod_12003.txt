ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Cardiac catheterization performed on [**2180-11-23**]: 1.
The right atrial mean pressure was measured to be 10 mmHg.
The right ventricular filling pressures were 33/12 mmHg and the pulmonary artery pressures were 33/20 mmHg, consistent with mild pulmonary hypertension.
The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure mean was 18 mmHg, while the left ventricular end diastolic pressure was 23 mmHg.
The cardiac output was 4.71 using the Fick equation in the cardiac index with 2.8 liters/min2.
Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%.
Blood was evacuated from the mediastinum and there was no evidence of surgical bleeding.
