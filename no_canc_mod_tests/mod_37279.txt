Micro: RPR non-reactive Blood Cultures [**2166-8-22**]: negative .
[**2166-8-19**] CT head: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
TTE [**2166-8-22**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the basal segments of the inferior and posterior walls.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
[**2166-8-25**]: RUQ ultrasound: The study is significantly limited secondary to patient body habitus.
Limited views of the liver show no focal lesions.
The polyp seen within the gallbladder on the previous exam is not seen on today's study.
Evaluation of the main portal vein with Doppler shows hepatopetal flow, appropriately, but there are periods of intermittent neutral flow which could reflect portal hypertension.
An initial head CT was negative for mass effect or bleeds.
Other diagnostic possibilities that were negative included screen for drug intoxication, sepsis, thyroid dysfunction, or seizure.
The patient was found to have a mildly elevated ammonia level, but the remainder of her synthetic liver function was normal.
The patient will need to have a sleep study as an outpatient to confirm the diagnosis of sleep apnea and to titrate CPAP.
She regained her blood pressure quickly following one round of epinephrine and atropine.
Her urine output continued to decrease and a temporary HD catheter was placed.
She is on a nephrocap and her electrolytes have been stable.
Swab was sent and cultures were drawn off the line and peripherally but all culture data is negative to date.
Her blood pressure improved with a 200 cc bolus and her hypoxia resolved spontaneously.
There were no acute issues during her ICU stay as the patient denied CP and the EKG was non specific.
TTE with new AS and CHF on exam (pitting edema, unable to assess JVD d/t body habitus).
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained.
# Anemia: Patient has a baseline anemia with labs suggestive of iron deficiency.
