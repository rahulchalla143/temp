Echocardiogram done on [**2141-1-5**] revealed an ejection fraction of 40% with an aortic valve area of 0.8 and a peak gradient of 76 mmHg.
NPH 22 to 34 units subcutaneously in the morning and 14 units subcutaneously at hour of sleep.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed his temperature was 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 90 (sinus), his blood pressure was 130/80, his respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was 99% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the left pupil round and reactive to light.
Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a harsh [**5-4**] holosystolic murmur with radiation to the carotids bilaterally.

Ultimately, on [**1-30**], the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with elevated blood sugars to 665, but no acidosis, and a minimal anion gap.
His Neo-Synephrine was quickly weaned to off, and he became hypertensive requiring nitroglycerin and Nipride infusions to maintain a systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg.
However, he was weaned to continuous positive airway pressure [**5-3**] on the day of surgery.
His mediastinal chest tubes were discontinued.
Vital signs revealed his temperature was 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 79 (sinus rhythm), his blood pressure was 140/69, his respiratory rate was 20, and his oxygen saturation was 93% on room air.
Weight preoperatively was 57 kilograms.
Weight on discharge was 62 kilograms.
Laboratory data revealed his white blood cell count was 16.7 (down from 17.7 previously), his hematocrit was 26.1, and his platelets were 431.
Sodium was 137, potassium was 5.9, chloride was 95, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 74, creatinine was 8.7, and blood glucose was 130.
Physical examination revealed the patient was alert and oriented times three.
Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Vancomycin 1 gram once per day as needed (for a blood level of less than 15).
