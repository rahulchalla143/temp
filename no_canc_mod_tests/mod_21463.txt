Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall, moderate hypokinesis of the lateral wall, and extensive apical hypokinesis.
was found to have 80% stenosis of D1 and 50% stenosis of LAD with an EF of 40%.
The patient's BP and HR remained elevated and the patient was given IV lopressor 5 mg times three.
ECHO done on [**2187-7-3**] showed EF-30% with hypokinesis in the LV of the ant.
blood pressure remained slightly elevated and his lopressor was maxed out at 150mg TID and lisinopril increased to 10 mg qday.
At that time he should set up an appointment to meet with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] next week and the patient should be referred to outpatient cardiac rehab at [**Hospital1 **].
has an Echocardiogram scheduled for [**2187-7-24**] with follow-up on [**2187-7-31**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5051**] at [**Hospital1 **] Cardiology ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 55958**]).
is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 months for further evaluation of his atrial tachycardia.
