Notable findings during her stay included a BNP >4000 (baseline of 1000), trigger for severe dyspnea/orthopnea, and an echo that showed profoundly worsened EF now down to 5% from 10-15%, with severe dilation of the LV.
RHC revealed markedly elevated left and right heart filling pressures that significantly improved with milrinone infusion.

CXR ([**2112-2-23**]): PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam from [**2111-8-10**].
RIGHT HEART CATH ([**2112-2-24**]): 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated filling pressures with a mean PCPW of 39mmHg and an RVEDP of 25mmHg.
There was severe pulmonary hypertension with a PA pressure of 71/41mmHg.
Cardiac output was diminished at 2.4L/min with an index of 1.3L/min/m2.
PA pressure fell to 60/42mmHg, and cardiac output increased to 3.4L/min with an index of 1.9L/min/m2.
Positive response to milrinone infusion with decrease in PA pressure, PCWP, and increase in cardiac output.
ECHO ([**2112-2-24**]): Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is profoundly depressed (LVEF= 5 %).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared to the prior study of [**2111-4-20**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is even further reduced, and now severe right ventricular contractile dysfunction is present, with markedly increased tricuspid regurgitation and at least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
LENIs ([**2112-2-24**]): Normal appearance of the deep venous structures of the right and left lower extremities.

Her EF was found to be 5%, BNP elevated to 4000 from baseline of 1000, and left and right sided pressures were markedly elevated (40s and 70s systolic respectively) on right cath performed on admission.
She improved significantly on milrinone 0.5/hr infusion: CI rose from 1 to 1.9, CO improved and trans-pulmonary gradient decreased, which dramatically improved her pulmonary hypertension.
She was transferred back to the floor, where PT eval on milrinone showed asymptomatic during ADL's and even climbing stairs.
Per ID consult, no further workup needed at this time as these issues are unlikely related to her chronic heart failure.
Iron studies and hepatitis viral studies WNL.
She underwent psych eval in CCU where she was found to be mildly delirious and it was recommended that home benzos be limited.
