At the OSH, her vitals were T 98.7, HR 72, BP 178/93, O2 sat 96% RA.
EKG was notable for ST elevation in anterolateral leads.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], her ABG was 7.37/45/107.
She underwent cath with stenting of LAD.

STUDIES: EKG [**10-30**] (OSH): NSR @ 68 bpm, ST elevation in I, aVL, V2-V5; ST depression in II, III, aVF EKG [**10-30**] ([**Hospital1 18**]): 87 bpm, ST elevations in V2-V6, TWI in aVL, V1, V2, Q waves in I, II, aVF, V1-V6.
The LMCA revealed no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
The right sided filling pressures were elevated (mean RA pressure was 13 mmHg and RVEDP was 15 mmHg).
The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean PCW pressure was 21 mmHg).
The cardiac index was depressed measuring 1.7 l/min/m2).
The final angiography showed TIMI III flow in the distal vessel and no evidence of dissection, embolization or peforation.
[**2140-11-2**] ECHO: LVEF 35%; [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated; nl LV wall thickness; nl LV cavity size; tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased LV filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg); mid to distal anterior, anteroseptal and apical akinesis/hypokinesis; AV leaflets(3) are mildly thickened; no AR; MV leaflets mildly thickened; mild MR; mod pulmonary artery systolic hypertension  Brief Hospital Course: INITIAL IMPPRESSION: 87 yo F with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia p/w chest pain, EKG c/w anterolateral STEMI, now s/p LAD stenting.
With her BP and HR stable, metoprolol was titrated up to metoprolol XL 200 mg qd and captopril to lisinopril 5 mg qd.
Her echocardiogram suggested increased LV filling pressure; therefore, furosemide 10 mg qd was started.
