Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Hypertensive urgency: Patient's blood pressure at [**Company 191**] in the 180s-190s systolic but up to 240s/130s in the ED.
Arterial line placed on arrival to the MICU registering blood pressures 50 points higher systolic than noninvasive monitoring.
On the floor, the patient BP remained initially labile with peaks in the 200s and lows systolic 100s-110s.
He was asymptomatic with high blood pressures at this time, but did complain of some lightheadedness with ambulation when he blood pressure was systolic 110s.
At the time of discharge his regimen consisted of: AM: lisinopril 40mg, Nifedipine CR 30mg, Labetalol 400mg, metoprolol XL200mg, minoxidil 5mg and valsartan 160mg.
