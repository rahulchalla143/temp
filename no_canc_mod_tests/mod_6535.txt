CXR was done with no evidence of infiltrate, EKG with A.fib in the 100's, however given her symptoms she was empirically treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Later during her course in the ER she became hypotensive with a temperature of 100, had a CTA that ruled out a PE, at CT head that did not show an acute process, an abdominal ultrasound was done that did not show any intra-abdominal pathology, but did show a pericardial effusion.
As a result cardiology did a bedside echo, which showed a small pericardial effusion, no evidence of tamponade.
Blood and urine cultures were also sent.
She then had a right IJ placed for SBP low of 65, and then persistent SBP's in the 70's, and was started on levophed at 0.03, with an improvement in her blood pressures to a systolic in the 100's.

[**2171-9-25**] CT Head W/Out Contrast: 1.
Comparison with prior studies would be helpful.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2171-9-29**] the patient is now in a paced rhythm at 71 beats per minute.
Her stool was guaiaic negative and transfusion was deferred as the patient was asymptomatic from her anemia.
She did not appear septic as there was no identifiable infectious source- blood and urine cultures from [**9-25**] were negative.
Blood cultures from [**9-29**] and [**9-30**] were pending on discharge.
There was no evidence of heart failure on her initial CXR and no discrete cause for her hypotension on ECHO.
A PICC was placed for antibiotic treatment and blood draws; this was discontinued on the day of discharge.
On the day of transfer to the wards, we were less convinced of the [**Name (NI) 10540**] (pt was afebrile, without a WBC elevation, and numerous cultures negative to date), so vanc and cefepime were changed to abx for COPD exacerbation (azithromycin, as patient is allergic to levofloxacin).
Diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure was restarted with IV lasix as patient sounded crackly on exam and a repeat CXR showed engorged pulmonary vasculature.
She will require a check of her electrolytes including BUN and creatinine at the time of follow up.
Her digoxin level was checked and was therapeutic on a qOD dosing schedule.
She was discharged with instructions to continue her digoxin, taper down and eventually discontinue her metoprolol, and follow up with her primary care doctor.
She received 1 unit PRBCs for symptomatic treatment and her hematocrit improved over the course of her hospitalization.
Iron studies were sent and seemed consistent with an anemia of chronic disease picture.
Her hct on discharge was 27.7 and patient was hemodynamically stable.
