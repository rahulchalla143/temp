INPATIENT [**2161-9-22**] Blood Culture, Routine-FINAL - Negative  IMAGING: [**2161-9-29**]   CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE - IMPRESSION: Less than 40% left carotid stenosis.
[**2161-9-29**]   EEG - IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of moderate diffuse background slowing.
[**2161-9-25**]   MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST - IMPRESSION: Multiple foci of signal abnormalities on diffusion images with occipital lobe with questionable low ADC changes and could suggest acute infarcts.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year-old woman with morbid obesity, CAD, NSTEMI, L4-L5 discitis, history of pancytopenia since [**2159**] was transferred from [**Hospital6 17183**] for further evaluation of fever.
Although we were recommending MRA HEAD/NECK and CT TORSO, she refused any further diagnostic tests.
Differential diagnoses include undiagnosed abdominal infections versus occult malignancy.
Patient is not interested in further workup at this time, but does consent to continuing the remainder of the recommended antibiotic therapy and going to LTAC for further therapy.
ACTIVE PROBLEM LIST: # [**Name2 (NI) **] bacteremia with history of other Gram positive bacteria in blood: Treated with Ceftazidime from [**9-27**] - [**10-4**], then changed to Zosyn [**10-4**] - [**10-25**].
When her mental status did not improve with her fever curve and antibiotic therapy, an MRI was done with revealed acute/subacute infarctions.
An EEG was also done which did not reveal seizure activity and was consistent with diffuse metabolic encephalopathy.
While she was found to have the psuedomonal bacteremia as above, it was unlikely to be the source of her original fevers as she had negative blood cultures at the OSH.
The biopsy of her L4/L5 was unrevealing and her CSF analysis was no consistent with infection.
Heme/onc was consulted and reviewed her bone marrow biopsy and felt it was within normal limits.
# Hypotension/sepsis: Upon arrival to the ICU, her blood pressures were stable at 150s systolic.
After that her BP were stable and ranging from 130-160 systolic.
Patient underwent an IR guided biospy, which revealed only clots.
Upon discussion with neurology regarding her MRI findings, her ASA and prasugrel were restarted.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for further workup of ongoing fevers.
Evaluation of the head with MRI revealed multiple areas of stroke.
