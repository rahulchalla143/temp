An echo was done for further evaluation of her hypoxia, which showed a dilated right ventricle and right ventricular volume overload.
Given her echo findings, elevated BNP/troponin the floor team was concerned that she may have a PE so she was empirically started on a heparin gtt as she was unable to get a CTA because of her [**Last Name (un) **] and radiology felt a V/Q scan would not be useful in the setting of her poor baseline CXR.
She initially was stable but with worsening renal function, when on the day of transfer she was found to be somnolent, confused and with an oxygen saturation of 87% on 4LNC.
She was placed on 6LNC with improvement in her oxygen satuartion improved to 92% but she remained tachypneic.
ABG done at that time was 7.22/59/70, she was placed on her nighttime bipap for her respiratory distress.
A CXR was done that was unchanged from prior, she was also noted to be febrile to 102.5 at that time.
VS on arrival to the ICU were: 100.4, 80, 105/43, 20, 99% on bipap with 6L.
Shortly after her arrival to the ICU she desaturated to the low 80's, at that time we transferred her to NIPPV with settings of [**10-19**] and an FiO2 of 100%, her oxygen saturations improved quickly on the new bipap settings.

Few mediastinal lymphnodes are seen, which do not meet CT criteria for significant adenopathy.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST: Limited non-contrast evaluation of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands and pancreas are normal.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is empty with a Foley catheter in place.
No obstructing cause is visualized and this may represent congenital megaureter, further evaluation with retrograde ureterogram is recommended for confirnation.
===================== Chest X-ray ([**2122-6-6**]): ===================== FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Study is markedly limited by underpenetration.
===================== Chest X-ray ([**2122-6-18**]): ===================== FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube terminates 4.1 cm above the carina.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2114-12-19**], the right ventricle is now dilated with probably depressed free wall motion .
Labs Pending at time of discharge: 2 blood cultures and 1 Urine culture   Brief Hospital Course: Hypoxic and Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The etiology of her hypoxemia is likely multifactorial, including obesity-related hypoventiliation syndrome, pulmonary edema, and possible PE.
Definitive imaging was unable to be obtained based on patient's body habitus and renal function precluding her from VQ scan or CT scan.
Additionally, given possible pulmonary edema aggressive diuresis was initiated with a lasix infusion and metolazone, resulting in a net negative diuresis of about 10 liters for her length of stay.
At time of discharge, her INR was still subtherepeutic.
Her creatinine peaked at 3.2.
Her creatinine improved and stabilized at a value of about 2.7 upon discharge.
Complicated Urinary Tract Infection: On admission her urine culture grew two speciations of E.Coli, both sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Goal vancomycin serum levels were 15-20.
Hyperlipidemia: Last measured in [**10/2121**] and LDL was 118.

You were started on a heparin drip to keep your blood thin, as well as another medication called "Warfarin (aka Coumadin)" to keep your blood thin.
