Noncontrast head and neck CT performed and per report did not show any abnormalities (other than lymphadenoapthy).

Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[**2105-12-28**] - CTA chest - 1.
35-mm left adnexal cyst, might be hemorrhagic.
Pelvic ultrasound is suggested for followup in six weeks for documentation of resolution .
Non-specific hypodense wedge-shaped area in the right kidney that could represent an area of infarction or pyelonephritis  [**2105-12-28**] - CT neck - 1.
[**2105-12-27**] - MRI head/neck - 1.
There is no definitive fluid collections on this MR study that would be indicative of abscess.
[**2106-1-8**] - MRI head - 1.
This has been described on the study done on [**2106-1-2**] and is soemwhat worsened since then.
Further evaluation with MR angiogram of the head is necessary, to assess the patency of this artery.
[**2106-1-9**] - CTA head - 1.
No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect on the CT of the head.
Blood cultures from OSH eventually grew Fusobacterium, consistent with concurrent diagnosis of likely Lemierres disease.
Neuro exam initially stable.
Anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT of 50-60.
She underwent a tooth extraction and aspiration of fluid collection in this region.
Repeat imaging with CT and MRI studies of head and neck were performed.
She will have repeat imaging of her brain in ~ 6 weeks.
CT chest showing likely septic emboli, which fits with clinical diagnosis of Lemierres.
Serial DIC labs were followed closely and hematology also followed her during the admission.
Found to have septic emboli on chest ct (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres with IJ thrombus, though IJ thrombus was not seen by the time she had imaging).
Received several contrast loads in past few days, got mucomyst and hydration.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO at bedtime: take 2 mg daily until INR check on [**2106-1-11**].
You need to have your INR checked on Monday [**2106-1-11**].
You should have an MRI (head) in 6 weeks, Drs.
