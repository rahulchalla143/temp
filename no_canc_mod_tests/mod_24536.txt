In the [**Hospital1 18**] was noted to be bradycardic down to 20 while asleep and 40s when awake with systolic BPs greater than 90.
His cardiac regimen has going under several changes including transiently on amiodarone, doubling of Dig to 0.125 mcg.
Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 2.2-2.6) 7.
-No known liver disease in the family  Physical Exam: Blood pressure was 94/60 mm Hg while seated.
Pulse was 49 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 12 breaths/min.
The lung sounds were decreased at the base bilaterally with dullness to percussion.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th intercostal space, mid clavicular line.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

His INR was 3.5 on admission therefore PE was unlikely.
The patient's urine output improved with these interventions and the lasix drip and dopamine drip were tapered off.
His heart rate normalized during his stay.
Once his INR was below 3, his coumadin was restarted (goal INR [**2-28**]).
His creatinine remained stable.
INR of 3.5 on admission.
When his INR trended down, coumadin was restarted as above.
