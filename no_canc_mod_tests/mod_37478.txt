Pertinent Results: STUDIES: CT head non-con ([**9-28**]): In the extra-axial space overlying the right lateral parietal cortex, there is a hyperdense focus measuring 8 mm in thickness, corresponding to an acute subdural hemorrhage.
MRI AND MRA OF THE BRAIN AND MRA OF THE NECK WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2113-9-30**].
FINDINGS: The study is compared with the recent NECT of the head, dated [**2113-9-29**]; there is no previous MR examination on record.
The axial 2D time-of-flight sequence is somewhat limited; however, there is normal flow-signal in bilateral common and proximal internal and external carotid arteries, which are grossly normal in caliber and contour, with no flow-limiting stenosis.
LUMBAR SPINAL PUNCTURE Study Date of [**2113-10-1**] 11:21 AM INDICATION: 79 y/o female with end stage renal disease, hypertension, fever, mental status changes.
HISTORY: Multiple attempts for lumbar puncture on the floor by the referring clinician were unsuccessful.
Access to the lumbar subarachnoid space was obtained with a 22 gauge spinal needle under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine and with aseptic precautions.
Approximately 10 cc of CSF was collected.
Final internal length is 26 cm, with the tip positioned in right subclavian vein.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2113-10-3**] 2:57 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-2**], the tip of the endotracheal tube remains about 2.3 cm above the carina.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2113-10-4**] 3:16 AM REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient with pneumonia after IMPRESSION: No significant appreciable change compared to the prior study.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2111-7-1**], the findings appear similar.
Prominent ventricles and sulci bilaterally are consistent with age-related parenchymal atrophy.

Brief Hospital Course: 79 F admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2113-9-28**] after a fall, found to have SDH and IPH, which were managed conservatively by neurosurgery.
She had a CT of her head which was negative for interval progression of hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift.
After returning the medical floor from Head CT, her BP was noted to be 189/84 with stable mental status, however she then was noted to have oxygen desaturation to the 80's.
She was noted to have had a fever of 100.6. .
Her BP droped to 160-170 systolic.
Subsequent EEG showed no NCSE.
Per Neurology her exam was described as follows: She opens her eyes to loud voice but requires frequent physical stimulation to keep them open; she produces only unintelligible sounds but no speech.
EEG without seizure activity.
MRI without evidence of infarction and MRA shows no stenosis.
Repeat head CT on [**10-8**] showed stable SDH/IPH.
After discussion with neurosurgery, she should have a follow-up CT of her head within 1 months of her discharge, on the day of a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Based on the above sensitivities, her abx were narrowed to nafcillin and cipro for completion of an 8 day course on [**10-10**].
after extubation, pt removed her NGT on [**10-8**].
Elevated pulse pressure may be [**2-18**] decreased compliance in light of DM and PVD.
SBP goals were 120-160 upon discharge from ICU given SDH and concern for HTN as possible cause of seizure.
# Toxic Mulitinodular Goiter:  TSH <0.02 which is usual; FT4 1.5.
Her FSs varied between 70 and 200 on this regimen.
She was noted to have a single bradycardic episode on [**2113-10-5**] during [**Date Range 2286**] and rectal tube placement, which resolved spontaneously, likely vagal event.
# anemia - hct 42 on admission, likely hemoconcentrated, gradual decline to 32-34. no active bleeding during this hospitalization.
LDH was 169, not suggestive of hemolysis.
stool cultures were negative for cdiff on [**10-11**].
