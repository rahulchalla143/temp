Images: portable chest x ray: no acute intrathoracic process .
EKG:wide QRS, STE in V1-V4 c/w hyperkalemia vs STEMI repeat EKG in MICU: sinus tachycardia at 120, NANI, no stchanges  A1c 9.9 (improved from 10.9)  H. pylori (-)  blood cultures negative   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  46M with hx of IDDM, etoh abuse pw DKA and ?STEMI vs hyperkalemia.
Patient does have a history of EtOH abuse but his tox screens are negative and he claims sobriety for the last 10 months.
Patient was treated in the ED with IVF, bicarb drip, IV insulin and drip, with improvement of his electrolytes and glucose.
Initially paient did have chest pain though this has resolved and his EKGs have normalized after improvement of DKA and K. Likely his STE were related to his hyperkalemia and were not a true STEMI.
TTE showed normal biventricular function without wall motion abnormalities.
Creatinine normalized with IVF.
