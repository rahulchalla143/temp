Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with LMCA that was free of obstructive disease.
Hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated systemic pressures.
There was near equalization of left and right sided filling pressures consistent with RV infarct physiology (RAp 18 mm Hg and PCWP 19 mm Hg).
Cardiac index was preserved at 3.8.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
He was given aspirin and plavix, started on integrilin + heparin drip, and emergently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization where totally occluding lesion of the proximal RCA was revealed.
Post catheterization echocardiography revealed an EF of 40% with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
His blood pressure and heart rate remained within normal limits.
There was concern for a bruit at his right groin catheterization site; ultrasound of that area revealed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
- Continue ASA, Plavix (for at least 1 month), Atorvastatin - Completed integrillin x 18 hours - Continue beta blockade, were cautious in setting of RV involvement - Restarted lisinopril .
2) Pump: EF 35% with inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
- Repeat TTE in one month - Atenolol, lisinopril - Avoid aggressive diuresis in setting of RV involvement.
3) Rhythm remained NSR - Metoprolol - [**Month (only) 116**] need ICD in future if EF further deteriorates .
