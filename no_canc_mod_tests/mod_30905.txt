An ultrasound (or PET scan) can be performed for better evaluation non-emergently.
# ARF - Initial Cr 1.2 quickly resolved with fluid resuscitation, c/w prerenal azotemia due to hyperosmotic dehydration.
# HIV/AIDS - Per ID recs, pt was continued on home HAART regimen and prophylaxis (Bactrim, azithromycin, and Diflucan).
# Pulmonary Nodule - Right middle lobe 8-mm pulmonary nodule highly suspicious for malignancy identified on CT of chest; will need further outpatient workup and serial exams to follow possible progression.
A PET scan is scheduled, however due to the patient's elevated sugars and small size of nodule, a negative PET scan can not rule out the presence of malignancy.
# Thyroid Nodule - incidental finding on CT of chest; will need further outpatient workup for further characterization.
An outpatient TSH should be obtained to asses the patient's thyroid status.
