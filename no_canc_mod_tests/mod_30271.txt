She had a FSBG that was >600 at that time, and other labs were significant for a hematocrit of 19.6 from a baseline of 27, a creatinine of 3.8 and PT of 23.6.
Upon arrival to the ED, her heart rate was in teh 80s with a BP of 100/60 and an O2 Sat of 100%.
GI was called and a gastric lavage via her PEG revealed coffe ground material without any fresh blood.
Of note, during her recent hospitalization, she was noted to drop her hematocrit from 32.8 on admission down to a nadir of 24.1; this responded to 29.3 with 2 units of PRBCs on [**2172-11-9**].
Two days later, her hematocrit had drifted down to 26.9 and she was given an additional 2 units of PRBCs with a response up to 35.0.
By the time of discharge, her hematocrit was back down to 27.2, though stable.
Review of Systems: unable to obtain from patient due to sedation/intubation; per son, no [**Name2 (NI) **], hematochezia, fevers   Past Medical History: - hypertension - recent left MCA stroke [**10/2172**] - left ICA stent placed [**2172-11-9**] - operative PEG placement [**2172-11-18**] following failure of swallow eval - paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, recently started on warfarin - reported COPD; no PFTs in [**Hospital1 18**] records - chronic renal failure, baseline creatinine approx 2.6 with secondary hyperparathyroidism - chronic diastolic CHF - hyperlipidemia - type 2 diabetes mellitus - depression - morbid obesity  Social History: Up until her recent hospitalization, Ms. [**Known lastname 71441**] lived with her son for several decades; upon discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] last week, she was sent to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.

Head CT w/o contrast ([**2172-11-29**]): No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Marked mucosal thickening within the nasal cavity and ethmoid air cells without fluid levels to suggest the presence of acute sinusitis.
CXR ([**2172-11-29**]): The lung volumes are diminished.
Recommendations: serial hematocrits [**Hospital1 **] proton pump inhibitor Repeat EGD if acutely rebleeds AP CHEST 10:05 P.M, [**12-2**]  HISTORY: Increased wheezing, crackles and dyspnea, assess for aspiration or pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-29**]:  Lung volumes are very low, and the anatomic detail in the lungs is obscured by respiratory motion, but there appears to be new consolidation in the right mid and upper lung consistent with pneumonia due to aspiration.

## Acute blood loss anemia secondary to GI blood loss: Hct on admission was as low as 15.
She was admitted to the MICU and monitored with serial Hcts.
She received 4 units of PRBCs intially with Hct rise to 29.
She received an EGD which showed blood in the fundus and superficial ulceration surrounding the G tube but no active bleeding.
Her aspirin, plavix, and coumadin were initially held.
Following her EGD, her Hct continued to slowly trend down to 25 and she received another unit of PRBCs with appropriate response to 30.
Upon transfer to the floor her vital signs were stable and her hematocrit remained between 28-30.
Head CT without any acute change.
Her mental status improved with blood transfusions and improvement in her renal failure.
Her mental status remained poor following extubation and there was concern for her respiratory status in this setting but her ABGs continued to be excellent not requiring further intervention.
Her oxygen requirements decreased with the addition of furosemide to her regimen which had been held during her ICU course.
She had a chest x-ray on [**12-3**] which was consistent with volume overload and possible aspiration.
On her recent hospitalization, she had a urine culture that grew our Enterococcus which was senstive to both vancomycin and ampicillin.
Unfortunately, urine culture was not sent prior to antibiotic administration and repeat urine culture grew only yeast.
Her renal function and leukocytosis improved over the course of admission.
Her baseline Cr was ~2.3-2.7.
Urine lytes were consistent with prerenal etiology.
Will need daily electrolytes until this resolves.
[**Month (only) 116**] need addition of another [**Doctor Last Name 360**], consider ACE inhibitor if creatinine allows given her diabetes.
## FEN: TFs were restarted following EGD and extubation.
