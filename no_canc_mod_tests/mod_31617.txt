In the ED initial vitals were T 96.6 BP 123/70 AR 111 RR 22 O2 sat 97% RA.
CT abd/pelvis showed mild cholecystitis with ductal dilatation and labs were in support of an obstructive picture.
She had an NGT placed and underwent ERCP which showed large CBD, sludge, small stones, with evidence of ampullary laceration likely from a passed stone.

HIDA nuclear scan could be performed to evaluate for acute cholecystitis.
MRCP and/or ERCP would be recommended to exclude ampullary pathology.
If further clarification is needed, a HIDA scan could be performed.
CXR - IMPRESSION: No evidence of free intra-abdominal air.

Brief Hospital Course: Septicemia, E coli - blood cultures at admission grew E.coli which was pansensitive the likely source was biliary tree (refer below).

Plan is to complete a course of 14 days total from the negative blood cultures [**2176-7-19**].
