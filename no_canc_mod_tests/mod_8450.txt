ETT: INTERPRETATION: 55 yo woman with h/o DM on insulin x 36 years was referred for evaluation of ST segment changes while tachycardic in ED being treated for diabetic ketoacidosis.
The exercise test was stopped due to fatigue.
She had metabolic acidosis with anion gap of 21 when she presented to the ED, which on arrival to the ICU had closed to 11.
Although she had an elevated WBC, she was afebrile and had a normal CXR and UA.
Given her clinical resolution, there was no evidence of infection and no further testing was done.
In the morning, her gap had closed and her fingerstick blood glucose was normal.
# EKG changes:  ST depression was noted in inferolateral leads while tachycardic in the ED.
These ST depressions disappeared after her heart rate slowed down.
She complained of some chest pain overnight on [**8-31**] and given this and her EKG changes, a ETT was done, which was negative (see above for details).
On admission, your heart rate was fast and you had some minor changes to your EKG.
You underwent an exercise treadmill test that was negative!
