STUDY: CT OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.
INDICATION: 58-year-old female status post thoracoabdominal aortic stent.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MDCT axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were acquired.
Following the administration of 60 mL of Optiray intravenous contrast, MDCT axial images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post endotracheal intubation.
A focal area of contrast extravasation is noted anteriorly along the graft at the junction of the two overlapping grafts and measures 3.1 x 0.8 cm (series 401B:image 39).
Comparison to the previous CT examination demonstrates increased of the size in this focal leak.
The kidneys, adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and abdominal portions of the large and small bowel appear grossly unremarkable and unchanged compared to the previous examination.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley balloon is present within the collapsed bladder.
This focal area of contrast extravasation has increased compared to the CT of [**2150-11-9**].
These findings were discussed over the telephone with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] by Dr  Brief Hospital Course: She was seen by vascular surgery and underwent repeat CT scan which showed findings consistent with endoleak at the lower pole of the graft to graft anastomosis with increased area of extravasation as compared to previous CT. She was hypertensive and her medications were adjusted.
She awaited normalization of INR prior to undergoing angiogram on [**11-24**] which showed no endoleak.
She underwent speech and swallow evaluation and aspirated.
