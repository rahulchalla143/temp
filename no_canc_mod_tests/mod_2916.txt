Admission Date:  [**2125-7-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-7-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2065-1-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Ampicillin / Sulfonamides / Codeine / Percocet / Succinylcholine Chloride  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**] Chief Complaint: ESRD on HD, admitted for kidney transplant  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right heart catheterization LURT, aborted due to PEA cardiac arrest post-anesthesia induction   History of Present Illness: 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease secondary to hypertension and diabetes.
His hypertension and diabetes has been complicated by nephropathy, and coronary artery disease, for which he underwent cardiac bypass in [**2123-6-11**].
His pretransplant workup encouraged a stress test that was unremarkable.
He underwent a cardiac echo that demonstrated an EF of 30 to 40% with 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Colonoscopy was performed in [**2125-1-11**] that demonstrated only benign adenomas.
He underwent pulmonary function tests in [**2125-5-11**] that demonstrated significantly reduced lung volumes, which are essentially unchanged from those performed in [**2120**].
He underwent lower extremity Dopplers noninvasive studies in [**2124-8-11**] that demonstrated noncompressible muscles bilaterally.
Following these pre-operative tests, a decision was made to proceed with surgery and he was admitted on [**2125-7-17**] to undergo kidney transplant.
Family History: Father died at 79 of an MI, had bypass at age 70 Mother died at age 82 of CHF and DM Brother had stents placed at age 58  Physical Exam: Blood pressure was 171/100 mm Hg while seated.
Pulse was 67 (paced) beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was (vent SIMV 600 x 12 or 15/5).
The neck was supple with JVP of 20 cm.
Cardiovascular examination revealed RRR, S1/S2, MR murmur, displaced PMI.
Neurologically: exam limited by sedation but no spontaneous movements, no withrawal to pain; no corneal reflexes; no gag.
Pertinent Results: On Admission: [**2125-7-17**] WBC-13.4* RBC-3.96* Hgb-12.6* Hct-37.0* MCV-94 MCH-31.9 MCHC-34.1 RDW-15.7* Plt Ct-113* PT-15.1* PTT-24.0 INR(PT)-1.4* Glucose-216* UreaN-46* Creat-5.0* Na-137 K-6.0* Cl-107 HCO3-21* AnGap-15 Calcium-9.1 Phos-2.8 Mg-2.0 On Discharge [**2125-7-23**] WBC-7.8 RBC-3.43* Hgb-11.0* Hct-31.4* MCV-92 MCH-32.2* MCHC-35.2* RDW-16.1* Plt Ct-125* PT-17.5* PTT-48.9* INR(PT)-1.6* Glucose-98 UreaN-85* Creat-5.9* Na-135 K-4.6 Cl-101 HCO3-21* AnGap-18 Calcium-9.0 Phos-6.1* Mg-2.5  Brief Hospital Course: Admitted on [**2125-7-17**], scheduled for kidney transplant, from a living unrelated donor.
CPR was initiated immediately, reportedly with adequate chest compressions.
After 10-12 minutes, cardiac rhythm was regained.
Intraoperative ECHO ([**7-17**]) revealed dilation of the left ventricular cavity was moderately dilated, with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-4-20**], contractile function of the left ventricle (and probably right ventricle as well) was significantly further reduced.
Cardiology recommended controlling BP and rechecking TEE.
Repeat ECHO on [**7-19**] revealed dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction, dilated right ventricle with at least mild systolic dysfunction, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-7-17**], the findings were similar.
Neurology recommendations included: CTA of head and neck (MRI possible due to AICD), IV thiamine 100 mg daily, avoiding sedating medications, maintaining normothermia, continuing normoglycemia with insulin drip, allowing BP to autoregulate until thrombosis and infarct excluded, and continuing IV heparin until thrombosis excluded.
