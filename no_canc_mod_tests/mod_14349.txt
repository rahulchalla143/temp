Initial EKG showed evidence of an anterior STEMI (2-3 mm elevations in leads v1-v4 with ST upsloping in v5 and v6, and reciprocal ST depression of 2 mm in inferior leads).
Hemodynamics at time of catherization showed  CO/CI 3.30/1.98 PA 23/15 PCWP 4.
The patient post-cath Hematocrit was found to be 19, and she was immediately transfused 4 U of PRBC and put back on pressors.
The Balloon Pump was pulled and a CT showed evidence of a retroperitoneal bleed.
Patients hypotension eventually resolved with medical management, she was taken off of pressors, and her Hematocrit stabilized.

A 7 French XBLAD 3.5 guide provided adequate support.
The filterwire would not cross the lesion, and a PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] Intermediate wire was passed into the distal LAD.
Right heart catheterization demonstrated low filling pressures, and fluids with peripheral vasconstrictors were administered.
Final angiography demonstrated no dissection, no residual stenosis within the LAD, with minor ostial narrowing of the jailed D1.
The LAD and D1 flow was TIMI 2 fast.
Resting hemodynamics revealed low mean PCPW pressure of 4mmHg.

Left ventriculography was not performed.
When the blood pressure remained low, despite these interventions, an inta-aortic baloon pump was inserted.
At the end of the case, after several liters of IV saline, the patient's blood pressure had stabalized and doses of  pressors were actively being weaned back.
The patient's blood pressure at completion of the case had improved to ~90mmHg on 5mcg/kg/min  dopamine and 40mcg/min Neosynephrine.
ECG was significant for [**12-27**] ST elevations in v1-v4 with upsloping in v5-v6, and reciprocal ST depression of 2mm in inferior leads.
A PTCA/[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was successfully placed in the LAD.
Patient was transferred to CCU for close monitoring and observation, due to hypotension during catherization.
Patient's cardiac enzymes were initally elevated with a peak CPK of 4315, CPK/MB of 465, MB fraction of 14.0, and Troponin of 20.67.
By hospital Day #3, Enzymes had trended down to CPK of 1703, CPK/MB of 154, MB fraction of 9.0, and Troponin of 4.41.
Hemodynamics showed a CO/CI 3.30/1.98 PA 23/15 PCWP 4.
A retroperitoneal bleed was identified and patient had a Hematocrit of 18.4.
Bedside Echo showed an EF of less than 20% and severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of all segments.
When Swanz was pulled on Hospital Day #3, CO 3.9, CI 2.3, PAP 23/18.
B.  Heme  Patient's hematocrit fell to 18.4 secondary to retroperitoneal bleed.
Patient hemoglobin A1c was 6.0%.
