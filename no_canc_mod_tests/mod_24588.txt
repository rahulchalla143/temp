His examination was  notable for occasional word-finding difficulties, paraphasic errors, difficulty with repetition, finger agnosia, acalculia, R/L discrimination difficulties, and R inferior quadrantsonopsia.
He was found to have a 3.0 x 2.7 cm left parietotemporal intraparehchymal hemorrhage on CT head.
His studies included head CT, CTA head/neck, MRI brain, MRA head/neck, and angiogram.
Head CT and brain MRI was significant for left parietotemporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
The angiogram showed an AVM in the left parietotemporal area.
