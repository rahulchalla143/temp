A KUB was obtained which showed significant fecal distension to approximately 14 cm with overall colonic distension.
Serial KUBs demonstrated no significant change in colonic distension over the forthcoming days and colonoscopy/colonic decompression was performed.
At the time of this dictation, patient's hematocrit has been stable for the past few days and she has had no obvious bleeding source.
It is felt that patient had anemia of chronic disease with depressed marrow due to her comorbidities and that her blood loss is due to phlebotomy and small volume blood loss from hemoptysis, lower GI bleeding and past vaginal bleeding.
GYN was consulted and endometrial biopsy was taken.
A followup CT urogram is planned, but has not been done to date due to other more acute medical problems.
