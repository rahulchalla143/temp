CRT [**2166**] who was recently admitted here [**6-30**] for ARF c/b SVT requiring version, NSTEMI who presents today from home c/o diarrhea, nausea, lightheadedness, vomiting, generalized weakness, diminished po intake for 4-5 days.
IJ cordis was placed and 2 units blood given as a small amount of BRBPR noted, 4 litres of NS given.
BP to 203/175 on levophed, then 119/56 on 0.4 ucg/kg/min.
Sent for abd CT then to MICU for sepsis.
NSTEMI - [**6-30**] - Catheterization did not result in intervention.
Pertinent Results: RADIOLOGY: ========== CT abdomen without contrast: .
Given this patient's symptom of hypotension, further evaluation with a chest CT may be warranted if clinically indicated.
Renal U/S [**2176-7-28**]: IMPRESSION: No significant change in appearance of the transplanted kidney.
ECHO [**2176-7-30**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-7-3**], the right ventricle is now significantly dilated and hypocontractile; the left ventricular ejection fraction is markedly increased.
Lung Scan:INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate diffusely heterogeneous tracer activity without focal defect.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show heterogeneous tracer activity in a pattern that matches the ventilation study.
The ventilation and perfusion images are similar to the prior study of [**2175-12-31**].
Portable Chest on [**2176-8-3**] after rales detected on lung exam.

CRT in [**2166**] with recent admission at [**Hospital1 18**] for ARF attributed to N/V and HCTZ who presents from home c/o LH, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea She was found to be profoundly hypotense requiring volume and pressors, WBC of 21 with bandemia.
In addition, her MMF was held out of concern that this was causing diarrhea.
Her hypotension resolved by day 4 and pressors were weaned off.
Her urine culture returned as Kleb pneumonia sensitive to levofloxacin and a number of other drugs.
Of note, an echocardiogram revealed RV dilatation with wide open TR.
With regard to her renal function, her creatinine was noted to improve with volume resusciation.
A CMV viral load was also ordered.
