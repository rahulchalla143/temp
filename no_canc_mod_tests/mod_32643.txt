FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2178-4-5**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2178-4-8**]):    NO GROWTH.
Cytology Pleural Fluid:   NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CXR: [**4-1**] IMPRESSION: Large right pleural effusion, increased in size since prior study.
CXR: [**4-2**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-2**] at 6:31 p.m.  Elevation of the right lung base due in part to subpulmonic pleural effusion has worsened, and volume of right pleural fluid layering posteriorly and collecting in fissures has increased.
CT [**4-3**] IMPRESSION:  1.
6-mm peribronchovascular nodule in the superior segment of the left lower lobe which is new compared to the prior study and is most likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
However, a small iatrogenic vascular malformation cannot be excluded (e.g., if the patient has undergone Swan Ganz catheter placement) and a followup contrast enhance CT is recommended in three months to ensure resolution or to further characterize if persistent.
Stable compression fracture, of T10 vertebral body, unchanged since chest x-ray of [**2178-1-18**].
CXR [**4-4**] The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
The left basal atelectasis is new since [**2178-4-3**], chest radiograph but is not included in the field of view of the study obtained on [**2178-4-4**], at 4:24 p.m. No pneumothorax is present.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and no failure is seen.
CT Chest [**4-5**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Followup to resolution with repeat scan in three months is recommended.
CXR [**4-7**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-6**], the pigtail catheter has been removed.
A CXR on admission showed right effusion likely a sympathetic effusion secondary to ascites.
The patient's INR was 2.2 and she recieved 4U of FFP and underwent thoracentesis at the bedside and 1.6L were removed [**4-2**].
The fluid was consistent with a transudate, cultures negative and cytology negative for malignant cells.
During the night the patient became hypoxic requiring 2-3L NC and Hct drop to 22.8 from 27.2 .
Repeat CXR showed reaccumulation of some fluid, but the patient remained stable and was able to be weaned to room air in the AM.
The patient under CT scan of the chest that showed large right pleural effusion that was not consistent with hemothorax.
The patient remained stable, but again became hypoxic on [**4-4**] requiring NRB and continued Hct drop to 17.
A repeat diagnostic thorocentesis revealed bloddy fluid.
Repeat CT scan and CXRs showed continued small right pleural effusion.
Her pigatil catheter was clamped and then removed after CXR did not show reaccumulation.
Her Hct remained stable and respiratory status remained >95% on room air.
Her creatinine improved to 1.0 after blood products.
Lung Nodule: CT-scan showed indeterminate nodule in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, measures about 7 mm.
Followup to resolution with repeat scan in three months is recommended.
Calcium 600 + D(3) 600-400 mg-unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
[**Last Name (STitle) 76894**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76895**]  It is recommended that you have a repeat CT-scan in 3months to re-evaluate a small lung nodule.
