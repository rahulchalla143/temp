He had cut his left leg with a saw blade on [**2129-9-2**], and subsequently developed erythema of the leg.
On [**2129-9-4**], he awoke with fever, chills and rigors and went to [**Hospital3 4527**] where he was noted to have a temperature of 104 degrees and also appeared to be uncomfortable and short of breath.
His saturations were 92% in room air and improved to 97 to 98% with four liters nasal cannula.
His blood pressure at that time ranged from 120/60 to 150/90.
His blood pressure subsequently dropped to 80 systolic and the patient was started on Neo-Synephrine infusion and had aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Chest x-ray showed evidence of pulmonary edema which was treated with Lasix.
He was placed on CPAP and then a nonrebreathing mask but the saturations were still in the low 90s with arterial oxygen tension of 62 to 74 mmHg.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.9, heart rate 100 beats per minute, normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 86/33 and respiratory rate was 30.
After intubation he was ventilated on pressure support of 20 with a PEEP of 10 and he was on 100% oxygen.
Extremities 3+ peripheral edema left leg, torso edematous with palpable pulses.
LABORATORY DATA:  White cell count was 12.2, hematocrit 36.6, platelets 211,000.
Sodium 143, potassium 3.9, chloride 99, bicarbonate 31, blood urea nitrogen 26, creatinine 0.7, blood sugar 136.
Creatinine kinase was 96 and troponin was negative.
Arterial blood gases on 100% oxygen pH 7.47, pCO2 47, pO2 90.
Chest x-ray was of poor quality and diffuse alveolar infiltrate suggestive of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure.
Ultrasound of the lower limbs showed normal compressibility of the lower limb veins which was negative for deep vein thrombosis.
Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with normal axis, with no evidence of ischemia.
He was monitored with a PA catheter.
After the initial course of hemodynamic instability, there was a face of hypertension where the blood pressure was difficult to control requiring increasing the doses of the antihypertensive medications.
There was one episode of fast atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability which required cardioversion.
The oxygenation improved gradually and for the past two weeks, there has been no evidence of respiratory distress.
The saturations are 100% and the carbon dioxide levels have been ranging from 35 to 45 mmHg during this time.
Hematology - The patient's hematocrit has been stable during his MICU stay and he did not require any transfusions during the hospital stay.
Infectious disease - Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive and positive blood cultures.
He was Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive in sputum on [**2129-10-19**].
Prophylaxis - He is on Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d., on Protonix 40 mg intravenously once a day.
He has stable blood pressure and is in normal sinus rhythm.
He had a swallowing study done and trial but he failed this assessment because of aspiration of colored water and aphonia.
He also had an ENT consultation in this regard and the cords are able to move but he is unable to phonates due to no leak around the tracheostomy tube.
The patient's admission weight was 197 kilograms and his discharge weight as of today is 158 kilograms.
