He underwent CT scan which showed a peri-pancreatic fluid collection.
A repeat CT scan showed evidence of cholecystitis.
Another CT scan was performed which showed a large fluid collection in the peri-hepatic area.
He has an NGT in place, a cholecystostomy tube in place and another drain which is likely in the 'abscess vs pseudocyst.

- [**2-20**] CT A/P: Perc chole drain in place.
- [**2-27**] CT Abd: Decreased size of hepatic fluid collection inferior to the left lobe, status post pigtail drain placement.
- [**3-5**] CT torso: small pleural effusion, compressive atelectasis, subhepatic collection decreased in size 13.7 x 1.7 cm, plastic biliary stent in plastic, liver unremarkable, no transhepatic/extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, spleen normal, adrenals normal, bilateral distal ureteral stones, 6.6 x 5.4 cm simple fluid which partially replaces pancreatic head -> stable, stable [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch wall thickening, no new acute intra-abdominal processes, decreased subhepatic fluid collection, cholecystostomy tube in good position - [**3-7**] Echo: Normal left ventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-2-24**], the right ventricular cavity is now mildly dilated with low normal systolic function and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
- [**3-8**] Cholangiogram: flow of contrast around but not through CBD stent, contrast flows into the duodenum - [**3-8**] CXR: Opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis and effusion, pulmonary congestion - [**3-9**] Triple Phase CT: No new acute intra-abdominal process identified, with relatively stable appearance since examination from [**2196-3-5**].
A needle aspirate was taken from his free peritoneal fluid using ultrasound and this demonstrated fluid c/w pancreatic drainage.
Additionally the patient was found, per record, to have pseudomonas in his urine as well as in sputum cultures, which was confirmed with Bronchoscopy/BAL.
He was initially covered with vanc/zosyn/cipro, although this was changed to ceftazidime when culture results were available.
Given the patients persistent hypotension, a random cortisol was sent and was normal.
A repeat CT was obtained on [**2-20**] to evaluate the status of his fluid collections.
His pancreatic drain was accidentally DC'd during transport, and following this, the patients abdominal exam was unchanged.
An MRCP was performed without any evidence of biliary dilation.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor his respiratory status remained stable with room air saturations of 96%.
An ERCP was done on [**2196-3-2**] as his bilirubin plateau ed at 6.3.
His nutritional labs are poor with a transferrin of 78.
A CT abdomen/pelvis showed no interval change.
His Urine culture grew VRE, so he was switched to meropenem + cipro + micofungin + daptomycin and then adjusted to Daptomycin + Ceftaz + Micafungin on [**2196-3-7**].
On [**2196-3-9**] blood cultures were positive for GNRs.
On [**2196-3-12**] Ceftazadime + Micafungin were discontinued, standing Colistin and Doripenem started, ERCP consulted and feels unlikely to benefit from endoscopic drainage.
Borderline blood pressures throughout day with intermittent marginal urine output requiring Albumin boluses, patient was made DNR by family but OK to intubate.
Labs showed an increasing WBC count, c.diff was sent from rectal sample and ostomy.
