This chest radiograph was reported in conjunction with the follow-up study in which the ET tube has been withdrawn.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality; no obvious vegetations; normal left ventricular ejection fraction .
CT head: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is diffuse obliteration of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation consistent with mild diffuse cerebral edema.
Technically limited study due to the very echogenic liver which is consistent with fatty infiltration.
She required 4 pressors to maintian a MAP >65.
When the CT head returned with cerebral edema, her family changed her goals of care to comfort.
