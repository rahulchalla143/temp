She had CT abd and U/S which were unrevealing.
Blood pressures initially 150s systolic, then became hypotensive into the mid to low 90s.
BPs were in low 100s on transfer to the floor.

[**2186-5-10**] CXR: PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The lung volumes are low.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral effusions, increased on the right, mild CHF.
[**2186-5-10**] LUE ultrasound: FINDINGS: Grayscale and color son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging of the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins was performed.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-10-12**], severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension are now evident.
Since the previous tracing of [**2186-5-10**] A-V paced rhythm is now absent.
[**2186-5-12**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-11**], there is little overall change.
Lung volumes have mildly decreased.
Baseline blood pressures are 130s-140s and patient was hypertensive at rehab.
These interventions were therefore withheld, and the patient's blood pressure improved on its own with diuresis and antibiotics.
WBC count was not elevated.
Negative cardiac enzymes were reassuring for minimal contribution from acute cardiac ischemia.
Echocardiogram showed right heart failure and pulm htn and she received IV Lasix to promote diuresis with good effect.
Hepatitis serologies were sent and were negative.
Blood sugars remained low normal (lowest am blood sugar 58).
Endocrine was consulted and recommended ACTH and free cortisol levels which remained pending at discharge.
-Pt should have recheck TSH and FT4 [**3-1**] wks post-discharge  # Mental Status Changes: Felt likely from acute medical issues and underlying dementia.
