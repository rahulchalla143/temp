NCHCT [**2193-5-9**]: 1.
CT of the neck and chest might be considered.
CT CHEST [**2193-5-9**]: 1.
CT NECK [**2193-5-9**]: 1.
RENAL US [**2193-5-9**]: 1.
CT NECK [**2193-5-11**]: 1.
CT CHEST [**2193-5-11**]: 1.
BARIUM SWALLOW [**2193-5-11**]: Swallows of thin barium in the frontal, lateral, and oblique positions show normal swallow function without evidence of leak.
KUB [**2193-5-12**]: There is contrast material seen throughout the colon including the appendix.
RUQ US [**2193-5-14**]: The liver is normal in size and appearance.
CXR [**2193-5-15**]: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval resolution of pulmonary edema from the mid and upper lung field when compared to the study from three days ago.
CXR [**2193-5-20**]: Lung volumes remain quite low and there is substantial bibasilar atelectasis which has not cleared over several days.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2193-5-22**] 08:00AM BLOOD WBC-11.7* RBC-2.42* Hgb-8.3* Hct-24.8* MCV-103* MCH-34.4* MCHC-33.6 RDW-13.4 Plt Ct-238 [**2193-5-22**] 08:00AM BLOOD Glucose-80 UreaN-20 Creat-8.2*# Na-137 K-3.9 Cl-98 HCO3-29 AnGap-14 [**2193-5-21**] 08:20AM BLOOD ALT-59* AST-91* AlkPhos-41 TotBili-0.3 [**2193-5-20**] 11:15AM BLOOD Lipase-298* [**2193-5-22**] 08:00AM BLOOD Calcium-8.2* Phos-4.1 Mg-1.9  MICROBIOLOGY: Urine culture [**2193-5-9**] negative Blood culture [**2193-5-13**] negative Blood cultures 06/15/-[**5-22**] pending (no growth to date)  Brief Hospital Course: 32M with a history of bipolar disorder and depression who presented from an outside hospital with anuric renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis secondary to a toxic ingestion of cough syrup, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure s/p traumatic intubation resulting in pneumomediastinum.
Notable labs included Na 150, Cl 114, HCO3 18, Cr 3.9, and CK [**Numeric Identifier 111890**], Ca 6.8, ALT 185, and AST 1070, WBC 17.9.
The patient's urine tox screen was also positive for cocaine and opiates, but his serum tox screen was negative for acetaminophen.
His rhabdomyolysis resolved with CK and LFTs trending downward.
There was no evidence of hepatologic pathology, hepatitis serologies were sent and were negative.
The patient's Cr continued to trend up during his stay in the MICU, and urine output was minimal.
Of note, Hepatitis B and C serologies suggestive no history of hepatitis C and immunity to Hepatitis B.
He also had a PPD that was < 2 mm induration.
Thoracic surgery performed bronchoscopy and endoscopy and noted no tear from the carina all the way up to the cricoid.
Chest Xray from [**5-15**] showed radiographic resolution of pneumomediastinum.
#LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient's WBC was elevated at 17.9 at admission, but quickly normalized following admission.
He again developed a WBC late in his hospitalization and was evaluated for infectious causes with a negative CXR, urinalysis, urine culture and blood culture.
His WBC count trended down over the course of his stay on the medical service without further concern for infection.
As patient did not have existing hypertension prior to his toxic insult he was not felt to be at high risk for developing end organ damage and permissive blood pressures to the 160s were felt resonable as he was likely to further improve with ongoing dialysis.
He did had a NCHCT to evaluate for evidence of PRES syndrome given his nausea and vomitting that developed late in his hospitalization, but there was no radiographic evidence of demylenation.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - He will need to establish with a primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 111891**]n with repeat LFTs and CK on outpatient basis to trend to normalization as psychiatric discharge -MWF dilaysis -monitor urine output -full code - Contact: Father Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 111892**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 111893**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 111894**].
You also had pneumomediastinum from a traumatic intubation, which has resolved.
