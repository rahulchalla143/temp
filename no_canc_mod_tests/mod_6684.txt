Redemonstration of reversal of portal venous flow.
[**2125-1-30**]: ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.

An extensive workup looking for potential causes of her diarrhea inlcuding: - stool cultures : these were negative - paracentesis: negative for SBP, malignancy - TTG: negative - C Diff cultures - were negative - GI service was consulted and followed patient while on floor.
- abdominal imaging including ultrasound and plain films did not identify any potential causes.
On the night of [**1-29**], patient lost all access (had an EJ only), and was unable to take IVF as per usual.
After approximately 1.5L of fluid resuscitation, patient's blood pressure  returned to SBPs in the 90s.
However, on [**1-31**] paracentesis removed 2.6L ascites fluid -> her bladder pressure improved from 32 to 17 and her ABGs showed improving ventilation.
During her intubation on the evening of [**1-30**], patient became [**Date Range 24420**] with SBPs in the low 70s.
Cultures were sent, but were negative.
Over the course of the first few days of her MICU admission, patient's Cr began to rise from -  1.2->1.8->2.2->2.9->3.1 and at the same time, her urine output started to decline.
The creatinine rose despite giving about 10L of IVF from [**Date range (1) 31957**] and her urine output continued to decline to near anuria.
Urine studies could not be helpful in this setting because lasix was used in an attempt to diurese her and FeUrea is not useful in the setting of HRS.
Discussed option of ERCP with GI service; however they saw no imminent need for an ERCP of MRCP.
Her Sputum from [**2-2**] did grow out GNR which grew out to be pansensitive serratia liquifasciens.
- she was continued on rifamixin, and Ceftriaxone was added [**1-31**] - Tap negative for SBP - continued Ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis .
