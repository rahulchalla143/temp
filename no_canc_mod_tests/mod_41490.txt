MRI ([**2110-8-25**]) In comparison to [**2110-8-17**] exam, diffuse bilateral T2/FLAIR hyperintensities have significantly progressed.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 31 year old male with no significant PMHx who presented to OSH with complaints of weakness developing acute respiratory failure found to have a saddle PE started on heparin gtt trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management with MRI findings suggestive of ADEM treated with IV steroids/IVIG, whose mental status and neurological function improved.
# ADEMS: Patient underwent head MRI as well as full spine MRI as part of work-up of his clinical picture, and Neurology felt that the findings were consistent with ADEM.
The patient's exam improved along with repeat MRI imaging showed progression of the lesions, but this was in the context of improved exam clinically, and no further interventions were done.
His diaphgram has improved function with today's NIF of -43.
Patient was hemodynamically stable upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] with SBP 130-140s.
Patient was initially continued on heparin gtt, at one point being transitioned Lovenox /coumadin which he currently is on with INR of 1.8 on [**2110-9-4**], 1.8 [**9-3**], [**9-2**] 1.7.
Work-up at the OSH included: negative HIV; weakly positive Lyme IgM, negative Lyme CSF, negative Monospot, Negative Babesia, Negative anaplasma, positive EBV CSF serology.
Repeat lumbar puncture was done; culture data returned showing no growth and serologies were negative.
The patient was initially on broach spectrum antibiotics upon ID recommendations, but with negative CSF culture data, negative CSF data antiobiotics were then peeled back.
His fevers were attributed to ADEM and resolved week prior to discharge  # Elevated LFTs: There was concern for viral hepatitis, though viral serologies at [**Hospital1 18**] returned negative.
