He was mentating, had stable blood pressures, putting out 50cc/hr urine with good peripheral pulses.
Pacing pads were placed and an amiodarone bolus was administered with initiation of an amiodarone gtt.
His rate slowed with the amiodarone and his rhythm returned to a narrow complex irregular tachycardia.
He was also noted to have a wide-complex tachycardia and was started on dofetilide, amiodarone and esmolol gtt per the EP team which were then stopped and then transitioned to diltiazem, labetolol, which he was taking as an outpatient.
Neurology was consulted and recommended holding anticoagulation given lower GI bleed and to maintain SBP 140s-160s.
Pt has remained hypertensive to a peak sbp of 185/126 and his diastolic blood pressures remain high.

Carotid u/s OSH: R >50% external carotid stenosis, L < 50% external carotid stenosis, no internal carotid stenosis bilat .
Colonoscopy on [**1-2**] revealed several possible etiologies of bleed: internal hemorrhoids vs. rectal varices vs. diverticuli.
Patient will need Hct checked tomorrow, on [**2195-1-4**].
If patient had any further GI bleeding, he would likely need tagged red blood cell scan or anoscopy to evaluate the source of bleed.
An MRI/MRA on [**12-24**] revealed an acute infarct of R ACA without discrete vascular abnormality (no acute cutoff or discrete stenosis) at R ACA.
He recovered much of his function on left side, however in setting of low blood pressure (SBP < 130), patient had re-expresion of these symptoms.
His blood pressure was therefore maintained between 140s-160s.
Antihypertensives were intially held due to GI bled, but were resumed with blood pressure goal of 140s-160s systolic due to recent CVA.
Patients blood pressure medications were converted from long acting to short acting for better control of blood pressure goal.
LDL was checked and found to be 25. .
