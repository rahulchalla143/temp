Her ABG on 2L did show excellent pO2, and the patient felt more comfortable, remained stable from a respiratory standpoint and did not require Bipap.
On review of CXR 2 view there was no evidence of PNA.
She underwent an echo which showed moderate pulmonary edema.
She will have PFTs done as an outpatient and will follow-up with the [**Hospital 2182**] clinic.
Blood glucose in the ICU/ED have been in the 200s.
On transfer to the floor, patient's blood sugars remained high, likely related to prednison.
Serum/urine Osm and urine Na were checked, although this may be altered [**1-12**] pt's HCTZ.
Her hyponatremia was believed to be [**1-12**] mild hypovolemia from increased osmotic diuresis with glucosuria in addition to her HCTZ.
HCTZ was held, and po hydration was encouraged and her sodium level normalized.
Your blood glucose levels were also very elevated.
The following changes were made to your medications: - STARTED Prednisone 20 mg by mouth- please once a day for 5 more days - STOPPED Hydrochlorothiazide- this was stopped because your sodium levels were too low.
