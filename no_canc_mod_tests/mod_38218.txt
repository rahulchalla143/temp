At [**Hospital1 **], initial saturations were in the low 80s and a CXR demonstrated cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, and infiltrates.
Labs were significant for elevated BNP (555) and troponin I (2.2).
EKG demonstrated ST elevation in III, AVF with reciprocal depression lateral leads.
EKG demonstrated ST elevation noted III, AVF with reciprocal depression lateral leads initially felt to be < 1mm.
Troponin t 1.05.
V/S were 92 116/66 18 and 95 on 5L NC.

CXR [**2184-2-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE [**2184-2-4**]: Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
