A focal infiltrate cannot be totally excluded.
[**11-16**] RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND:  Limited views of the liver demonstrate no focal or textural abnormalities.
Limited views of the right kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis or calculi.
Due to extensive inflammatory changes, the patient is at risk for sequela of severe pancreatitis including necrosis and vascular complications.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF 50-60%) (The inferior wall appears hypokinetic on some views, but not all).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Blood cultures from the OSH and [**Hospital1 18**] were all negative.
A CT chest showed b/l pulm infiltrates, but no PNA.
A repeat CT showed extensive and severe  pancreatitis, but no sign of necrosis.
A head CT was done to rule out acute intracranial processes; it revealed atrophy along with enlargement of the ventricals out of proportion to the degree of atrophy.
She was noted to have worsening pulmonary edema by CXR despite diuresis at the OSH.
Bilateral pleural effusions were noted on Chest CT (negative for PNA or PE).
A TTE was performed to assess for CHF which showed low normal EF.
Restarted as blood pressure increased.
