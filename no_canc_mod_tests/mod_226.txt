Exam revealed rales bilaterally.
Labs notable for WBC 12.1 (89% N, no bands), Cr 1.8 (no prior baseline in OMR), BNP [**Numeric Identifier 4550**], lactate 2.3.
CXR showed mild pulmonary edema, small left pleural effusion, and left lung base atelectasis vs. infiltrate.
VS prior to transfer were:  On arrival to the floor, patient reports continued dyspnea.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-5-11**] atrial fibrillation has replaced sinus bradycardia.
TTE ([**2146-7-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
AP PORTAL CHEST X-RAY ([**2146-7-21**]): 1.
PA/LATERAL CHEST X-RAY ([**2146-7-22**]): There is unchanged cardiomegaly.
PA/LATERAL CHEST X-RAY ([**2146-7-24**]): Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.
AP PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ([**2146-7-25**]): Lung volumes are lower today, exaggerating relative caliber of distended mediastinal veins and the extent of moderate cardiomegaly.
# Dyspnea secondary to pulmonary embolism: Initially attributed to diastolic CHF based on age, history of diabetes, JVP of 10-12cm and pleural effusion on CXR and BNP >10k, although dry mucus membranes and no edema peripherally.
Initially Troponins negative x2 and no evidence of ischemia by EKG.
Repeat troponins were not consistent with an acute ischemic event.
AGB was consistent with primary metabolic acidosis, with normal anion gap, with superimposed respiratory alkalosis and an Aa gradient of approximately 50.
[**2146-7-25**] VQ scan was consistent with right > left sided pulmonary embolism.
Her troponins began to increase and her urine output decreaed.
The evening of [**7-25**], patient's entered atrial fibrillation with RVR with decreasing O2 saturations, decreasing blood pressure to 80s systolic and no urine output.
Echo without wall motion abnormalities.
Patient was treated with an insulin sliding scale, Lantus 10 units subcutaneously every morning, which was increased to 14 units prior to transfer to the unit for sugars in the 250 range.
Prior to discovering the pulmonary embolism, we increased metoprolol succinate 75mg qd for heart rate control to attempt to improve forward flow and ASA 81mg qd  # Hypertension:  Fair control initially.
