[**2101-9-7**] CT head: negative  [**2101-9-11**] CT: 1.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right, and left basilar atelectasis.
This is a relatively non-specific finding with regard to an evaluation for seizures.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was found to be hypotensive with a hematocrit of 12 and was immediately transfused with 6 units of PRBC.
Plain film imaging was done and the patient was taken emergently to the operating room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy with splenectomy.
His post-operative course was notable for hypotension which initially required pressor support (an echocardiogram was done which was normal) and ventilary dependence.
He passed a swallow study and his diet was advanced to a regular diet on post-operative day 20.
