He was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate in the 160s.
EMS found him with a heart rate of 72 and regular, blood pressure 60/palpable.
Cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30187**] and his nurse practitioner [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30188**].
Vital signs revealed pulse 84, blood pressure 95/48 on 5 of Dopamine, respiratory rate 24, saturating 96% on two liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination revealed moist mucous membranes.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, the patient had white count 8.2, hematocrit 39.9, platelets 258,000.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.9, chloride 102, bicarbonate 16, blood urea nitrogen 73, creatinine 3.9, glucose 131.
INR was 1.1 and partial thromboplastin time was 27.4.
The CKs initially was 34 and increased to 38 and troponin was 0.3 increasing to 1.4.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, small left pleural effusion.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with right bundle branch block as well as left anterior fascicular block, Q wave V1 through V3 and ST depressions 1.0 millimeter with T wave inversions in V1 through V6 which are old.
OTHER PREVIOUS HISTORY:  The patient has a history of an ejection fraction of 35% with 3+ mitral regurgitation, status post coronary artery bypass graft [**1-/2135**] and aortic valve replacement [**1-/2135**].
ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 77 year old with coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, status post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valve replacement, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 35% and 3+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ aortic insufficiency, pulmonary hypertension with multiple admissions for right greater than left sided heart failure, status post a recent admission [**8-12**], to the [**Hospital1 882**] for osteomyelitis complicated by a bacteremia on a six week course of antibiotics, recently discontinued two weeks ago, now admitted with hypotension, chest pain in the setting of a beta blocker, treatment for an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation [**2136-10-10**], and likely a hypovolemic state.
Troponin and CKs were negative on admission.
His electrocardiogram was unchanged.
The plan is to continue Aspirin and Heparin until rule out myocardial infarction, titrate off Dopamine as blood pressure improves with normal saline boluses, hold his ace and diuretic while hypotensive, continue Quinidine, hold Coumadin if remains in normal sinus rhythm, consider echocardiogram to evaluate for any worsening of function to explain worsening paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea symptoms and weight gain, continue Zocor.
Saturation within normal limits in room air.
Renal - Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine around 2.0 at baseline.
Will send blood cultures, urine cultures.
Will send C. difficile, guaiac stools, start Zantac, will check liver function tests given history of ETOH use.
Hematocrit increased on admission likely reflecting dehydration.
Platelets and coagulation studies are within normal limits.
Follow hematocrit with hydration.
Prophylaxis - On Zantac and Heparin.
The patient was transferred to the floor once he was weaned off Dopamine and his creatinine began to decrease.
The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, however, he continued to have good oxygen saturation in room air.
His creatinine decreased throughout the course of the hospital stay, however, it was still 3.2 on [**2136-10-13**], continue to hold his ace inhibitor for now.
