CT head demonstrates loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the right temporal region and no hemorrhage is seen.
CT perfusion does not show abnormality in the right temporal lobe but a small area of perfusion abnormality is seen in the right frontal region.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates no vascular occlusion or stenosis.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates no vascular occlusion or stenosis.
[**8-3**] MRI Brain IMPRESSION: Acute right partial middle cerebral artery infarct with small subcortical infarcts and a small area of petechial hemorrhage as described above.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Her blood pressures remained well controlled.
Given her overall clinical stability and a follow up CT scan that showed no new hemorrhages, she was transferred to the floor where a work up for her first stroke was continued.
An LDL level returned elevated at 110, for which she was initiated on simvastatin at a low dose.
She reported to us that her cholesterol had been checked in the past and had been as high as in the low 120s, and treatment had been deferred at that time.
All of her and her daughter's questions were answered.
- She had a TTE which showed no evidence of an atrial septal defect/PFO or valvular vegetation.
-The TEE showed simple atheroma of the aortic arch.
-After the TEE results were known, the patient was requested to have LENIs/lower extremity ultrasound for [**8-7**].
