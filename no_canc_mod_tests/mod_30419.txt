CT perfusion demonstrates a large area of increased mean transit time in the left MCA distribution with patchy small areas of low blood volume indicative of ischemia with areas of infarction.
CT head [**10-4**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
CTA showed a dense left middle cerebral artery stroke with extensive small vessel disease and a chronic right periatrial watershed infarct.
There was delay in obtaining initial imaging as patient became ill in CT scanner with vomiting.
Her blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate, IVF were adminstered to maintain CPP.
Modifiable risk factors were A1C of 6.0 and LDL of 97.
Her heart rate remained in 60-80s [**Hospital 95320**] hospital stay and should this increase, a metoprolol formulation may be used to control the heart rate, goal 60-70s.
