Recommend repeat evaluation with PA and lateral chest radiographs.
Initial CXR was clear.
His stool cultures were pending but he had diarrhea in the setting of recent antibiotics and thus flagyl for possible Cdiff was started.
After this decision was made, pt's sputum culture was found to have klebsiella sensitive to only imipenum and meropenum and pansensitive pseudomonas resistant only to ciprofloxacin.
Stool cultures and Cdiff were negative.
He was transfused 2 units pRBC's with an increase to 24.
A CT scan of his left thigh showed a hematoma with suspected ongoing bleed based on appearance.
His repeat Hct was 21.
A pressure gauze was placed on his left leg and he was transfused an additional 2 units for suspected ongoing bleed.
