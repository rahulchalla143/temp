She was sent to the emergency department, where her hematocrit was 30 from a baseline of 36 and she was hypotensive into the 80s systolic.
Her INR was 3.0 at the time.
A duplex ultrasound demonstrated a small 1.4 x 1.2 cm pseudoaneurysm likely originating from an epigastric arterial branch.
A CT was performed confirming  a the fistula emanating from the femoral profunda and possibly from branches off the common femoral with distended femoral vein and multiple dilated venous branches extending into her pannus and into her vulvar region consistent with her presentation of bleeding episodes from her groin wounds.
The wound culture eventually grew klebsiella and proteus.
Her blood sugars have consistently been less well controlled.
