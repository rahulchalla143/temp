A head CT showed a small SAH and neurosurgery was consulted.
A head CT was repeated for concern for bleeding but the SAH was stable.
He also had several broken teeth and had a CT face and C spine to rule out fracture.
His BP was in the 180s and he was given some nitro paste.

FINDINGS:  Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
Following gadolinium, several small areas of high density seen and surrounding the hemorrhage and also along the margin which corresponds to blood products but subtle marginal enhancement is seen.
Subtle surrounding enhancement is seen which could be noted in a hematoma without underlying abnormality but a followup examination is suggested.
EEG [**3-15**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the disorganized and poorly modulated background with excessive admixed theta frequencies and bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing consistent with a mild encephalopathy.

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is generalized cachexia.
Evaluation of the lung parenchyma demonstrates moderate-to-severe centrilobular emphysematous changes within the upper lungs.
This study is not performed for evaluation of structures below the diaphragm.
Given the backround of moderate- to- severe emphysema, a followup CT chest is recommended in three months for further evaluation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-3-10**]: There are three foci of small subarachnoid hemorrhage identified.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2139-3-10**]: No evidence of traumatic injury within the chest.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-3-10**]: The c-spine is visualized from the skull base through T2.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-3-10**]: No fractures are identified.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
His follow-up NCHCT showed extension of the SAH in the post-central gyrus (which we hypothesized might be related to cortical venous infarction from the edema) as well as some bilat lat vent occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] intraventricular blood and L-sided small subdural heamtoma.
Due to the enhancemnet on MRI brain, he will have a repeat MRI brain with gad done in 4 weeks.
He had no respiratory complaints but coughed up some sputum, which prompted a CXR that showed some nodules and small L-sided effusion.
He had a Chest CT to follow-this and it again showed multiple pulmonary nodules.
Given this finding, in the context of his smoking, cachexia, and hyperparathyroidism, we were concerned for underlying malignancy and consulted pulmonology who counseled him re smoking cessation and recommended follow-up in their clinic with repeat Chest CT in 3 months.
