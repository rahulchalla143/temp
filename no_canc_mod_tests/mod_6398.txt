Chest x-ray no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Echocardiogram from [**2142-2-25**], revealed no significant effusion or tamponade.
Cardiac catheterization from [**2142-2-25**], selective coronary arteriography of the right dominant system revealed two vessel coronary artery disease, the left main coronary artery was normal.
Initial hemodynamic measurements revealed normal systemic pressure with an opening central pressure of 120/64.
Blood pressure recordings are not available following placement of the intra-aortic balloon pump.
At the completion of the case, her augmented diastolic pressure was 100 on a one to one setting.
An urgent echocardiogram was performed in the Catheterization Laboratory to rule out effusion/tamponade (following placement of the temporary pacing wire).
The study was limited but the right ventricle was well visualized with no significant effusion and no evidence of tamponade.
The patient's CKs were drawn during hospitalization with a peak CK of 1315 and a CK upon admission of 60.
The patient's cholesterol levels were also checked.
Total cholesterol was 135, LDH 55, HDL 65, cholesterol/HDL ratio 2.1, triglycerides 73.
Beta blocker and ace inhibitor were started, however, due to blood pressure the patient was continued only on the beta blocker.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable until [**2142-2-27**], at which time it was noted to be 25.0, down from 30.0.
Baseline hematocrit was 33.0.
Postcatheterization, the patient did not require blood products, however, on [**2142-2-27**], the patient's hematocrit was noted to be significantly lower at 25.0 from 30.0 the day prior.
The patient's hematoma was stable and the patient was occult blood negative.
Urinalysis sent on [**2142-2-25**], was negative for evidence of infection.
Phenytoin level was sent which was subtherapeutic at 3.1  The patient was given a bolus of Dilantin 300 milligrams times one.
