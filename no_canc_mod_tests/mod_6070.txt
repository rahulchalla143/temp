She did report fevers at home which was concerning for sepsis however she was without evidence of infection on exam, WBC was normal, CXR was clear, UA was unremarkable.
Blood and urine cultures showed no growth.
Blood pressure improved and she was transferred to the floor.
Her blood pressures were stable on the floor including >48 hours prior to discharge.
However MRI spine was without evidence of abscess, cord compression, and Neurology feels that exam is not consistent with primary neurologic etiology.
However, the patient's mood improved over course of hospitalization, and after discussion with the patients PCP and therapist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] NP ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 38156**]) the decision was made that it would be in the patient's best interest for her to be discharged back to her sober house ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 38157**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) under close supervision of her therapist.
EKG showed a QTC of 432.
She did not have post-ictal confusion, had no obvious injuries, had a non focal neuro exam and showed some signs during the episode, such as purposeful movements, that are not consistent with true seizures.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Patient was full code throughout this admission - Patient discharged home ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 38157**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]- sober house) with close PCP/NP/Therapist followup/supervision  Medications on Admission: KCl 10mEq albuterol PRN ASA 81 daily gabapentin 600mg TID Seroquel 300mg at HS clonidine 0.1mg QID  Discharge Medications: 1. gabapentin 300 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q24H (every 24 hours).
It was felt that your low blood pressure was due to your clonidine as well as dehydration.
Imaging of your back showed moderate narrowing of your spinal canal but no abscess.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your therapist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] NP ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 38156**]) on Thurdsday [**2106-7-1**] at 230pm.
