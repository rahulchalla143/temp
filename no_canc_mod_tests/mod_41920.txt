He presented to [**Hospital3 **] and a CT abdomen performed demonstrated a partial small bowel obstruction in the mid-abdomen.

[**2105-9-13**] KUB showed: In comparison with the study of [**9-11**], the contrast material from the right renal collecting system has cleared.
There is still mild dilatation of small bowel loops containing some residual oral contrast from a previous CT scan and demonstrating air-fluid levels on the decubitus view.
There are several air-fluid levels seen within the small bowel on the upright image.
[**2105-9-24**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showed: 1.
[**2105-9-27**] CXR showed: Consolidation in the right lung has spread from the juxtahilar right upper lobe to much of the right lower lung, accompanied by increasing moderate right pleural effusion.
[**2105-10-9**] CTA chest showed: 1.
Several foci of intraperitoneal free air, newly apparent since post-surgical CT from [**2105-9-24**].
[**2105-10-10**] CT abdomen/pelvis showed: 1.
Loop of bowel containing air and oral contrast may be trapped between the right lobe of the liver and the right thoracic wall, although it does contain new oral contrast since the CT chest performed several hours prior.
[**2105-10-16**] CT head showed: No acute large vascular territory infarct, shift of midline structures or mass effect is present.
He was seen by the Urology service initially as he had a ureteral stone noted incidentally on his Abd CT that was done at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
After waiting 6 days for resolution he was taken to the Operating Room on [**2105-9-17**] for an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and a small bowel resection.
A PICC line was placed on [**2105-9-18**] for hyperalimentation as he continued to be NPO.
A nasogastric tube was replaced and he had a Ct scan of the chest and abdomen revealing a new right upper lobe pneumonia.
Urine and blood cultures were negative and he was placed on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
His initial chest xray revealed a right upper lobe infiltrate but over time he devaloped multilobar infiltrates with a component of fluid volume overload.
He was given a ten day course of antibiotics for his physical and xray findings and all of his cultures including sputum were negative.
His chest xray showed the same multilobar infiltrates along with bilateral effusions and fluid overload.
On [**2105-10-4**], he was transfused 2 u PRBC for acute post-op anemia with hct of 21.9.
His hct responded appropriately.
Blood cultures and line tip culture up to [**2105-10-4**] ultimately showed no growth.
On [**2105-10-9**], CTA chest was obtained for poor respirations, finding acute pulmonary embolism, and the patient was started on a heparin gtt.
BAL cultures showed MRSA and yeast.
A perihepatic abscess was found and a drain was placed by IR.
On serial CXR, the pneumonia and pleural effusion progressively improved.
Medications on Admission: Vitamin A, Vitamin C   Discharge Medications: 1. heparin (porcine) in D5W 25,000 unit/250 mL Parenteral Solution Sig: Nine Hundred (900) units/hour Intravenous continuous gtt: Titrate heparin gtt to PTT 60-80 while INR <2.
Titrate warfarin dose until INR [**2-18**].
5. vancomycin 500 mg Recon Soln Sig: 1250 (1250) mg Intravenous Q 24H (Every 24 Hours): Check vancomycin trough before 4th dose.

If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for bleeding problems.
Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood test that is right for you.
The blood test used for monitoring is called an INR.
