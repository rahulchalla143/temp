Was also noted to have a white count of 14,000 and an ESR of 111.
The primary medical team at that point was concerned for epidural abscess, however, the neurological examination at that time did not clearly demonstrate evidence for abscess, and MR of the spine was reported negative for abscess.
However, this MR showed L3-L4 cord compression and was seen by Neurosurgery at the outside hospital, which commented that they felt that this was a diffuse process and nonfocal, and recommended following up with Rheumatology.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], her vital signs are stable, but unable to provide any reliable history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.3, blood pressure 140/54, heart rate of 56, respiratory rate of 20, and 94% on room air.
Lung examination:  Scattered crackles throughout the lung fields, no wheezes.
LABORATORY DATA FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White count 15.6, hematocrit 32.0, platelets 357.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.7, chloride 104, CO2 21, creatinine 1.1, digoxin of 1.8, TSH of 1.4.
Blood cultures were no growth to date.
A Neurology consult was obtained for further evaluation of the questionable L3-L4 cord compression seen at the outside hospital MRI scan.
Repeat MR [**First Name (Titles) 7837**] [**Last Name (Titles) 14796**] degenerative and postoperative changes most prominent in the lower lumbar spine as well as impingement on the exiting left L3 root.
This MRI revealed mild microvascular changes in the cerebral white matter, but no evidence of recent infarct.
She was then brought to the Electrophysiology Laboratory for transesophageal echocardiogram and electric cardioversion which was successful, and reverted her to normal sinus rhythm.
However, it was noted that on the second day of her Coumadin, she had an INR of 5.4 and her Coumadin was held.
She will need close followup of her INR as the patient is in acute rehabilitation.
They recommended following a hand x-ray to further evaluate the swelling of the left fourth digit which revealed extensive soft tissue calcifications, joint space narrowing, sclerosis, and subluxations in the DIP and PIP joints consistent with scleroderma.
Her Coumadin will be held until her INR is therapeutic between 2 and 3.
