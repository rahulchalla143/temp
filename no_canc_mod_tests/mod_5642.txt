HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old Caucasian female with known coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2119**], ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 25%, severe mitral regurgitation and diabetes.
Upon her arrival her heart rate was in the 130's and Dopamine was 3.5 and Dobutamine was 2.
However, mean arterial pressures remained above 70.
She also had a stress test in [**2124**] which showed fixed inferolateral deficits which were not reversible.
Severe/moderate MR, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 25%, hypertension, diabetes mellitus with nephropathy and retinopathy, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission included CBC with white count 10.8, hematocrit 38.2, platelet count 168,000, INR 3.5, PTT 34.6.
Chem 7 showed sodium of 134, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, CO2 24, BUN 36, creatinine 1.5, sugar 532, calcium 9.4, albumin 3.4, magnesium 2.0, Digoxin 0.8, CK 121, MB 5.6, troponin 0.9.
ABG showed the following:  PH 7.43, PCO2 31, PO2 66.
LFTs showed total bilirubin 1.7, alkaline phosphatase 221, ALT 29 and AST 59.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission vitals included the following: Pulse 82 and normal sinus rhythm.
Blood pressure 96/57 with mean arterial pressure 73, satting 98%, respiratory rate 18.
Peak pressure was 35, plateau pressure was 12.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**] underwent catheterization on [**2124-11-29**] which showed the following: Native three vessel disease with right sided dominance with LAD diffusely diseased, subtotal occlusion of the middle segment with competitive flow.
Graft disease showed the following: Patent SVG to right PLV with retrograde filling of PDA, Y graft to mid LAD/diagonal was patent.
Overall there was diffuse hypokinesis with left ventricular ejection fraction of 22%.
Cath also revealed 2+ MR and 1+ AR which was less than previously thought.
On [**2124-11-30**] she underwent EP study with ICD placement.
Of note, EP study was held off secondary to report of severe MR.
However, when cath revealed that MR was only mild disease, EPS study was completed without problems.
After ICD placement, chest x-ray was checked.
ID:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**] had UTI by urinalysis and culture showing greater than 100,000 colonies of Klebsiella.
Repeat urinalysis was bland with urine culture that has not grown anything to date.
INR began to climb, with peak INR of 8.4.
INR began to decrease and was 1.4 at time of EPS study.
