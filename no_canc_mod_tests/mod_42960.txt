FINDINGS: AP view of the pelvis and two views of the right hip are obtained.
FINDINGS: Single portable upright chest radiograph performed at 14:10 p.m. demonstrates increase in left small pleural effusion.
COMPARISON: Portable supine radiograph of the pelvis was performed on [**2196-10-19**].
FINDINGS: _____ view of the upper abdomen and a supine radiograph of the abdomen and pelvis show normal bowel gas pattern and no evidence of intra-abdominal free air.
