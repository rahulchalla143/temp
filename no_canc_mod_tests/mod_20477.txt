CXR [**9-30**]: Marked engorgement of the superior mediastinal veins may be due in part to supine positioning, alternatively right heart dysfunction and/or pericardial effusion.
EKG's: EKG: OSH [**1-1**] 1:15 AM - NSB 50 bpm, 2 mm [**Apartment Address(1) **],3,F.
Axis 0 EKG 2 AM - SB 47 bpm, submm STE lead 2, TWI AvL and AvR.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right sided pressures.
Mean PCWP = 23 mmhg.
Left heart catheterization revealed systemic hypertension.
Fick calculated cardiac output and index were normal at 6.2 and 2.6 respectively.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection or embolisation.
ECHO post cath: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Nor did he exhibit further symptoms, EKG changes, or arrhythmias.
His HTN was well controlled throughout his hospital course.
Echo showed a preserved EF after catheterization.
He was transferred to the floor prior to planned discharge after a PT evaluation.
Prior to cardiac rehab, he would likely benefit from a stress test to evaluate the physiologic significance of the ostial lesion in the RCA 3.
You had a coronary catheterization and received a stent.
