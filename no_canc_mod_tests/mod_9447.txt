An EKG showed no acute ST or T changes, with atrial fibrillation at 80.
Brother, at 77, had a bypass graft.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.6 F.; 130/82; pulse is 92; respiratory rate 18; 91% on room air and 93% on two liters.
Lower extremities with mild edema bilaterally and two plus dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
LABORATORY:  EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 66; no acute ST or T changes.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly without evidence of failure.
White blood cell count of 5.5, hematocrit of 38.2, platelets 222.
The patient was kept on heparin and cardiac catheterization was performed when the patient's INR was less than 2.0.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2179-2-12**], which showed three-vessel disease.
CT scan which was obtained after this embolic event showed a left thalamic hypodensity likely representing a subacute chronic infarction.
On postoperative day number three, the patient's chest tubes were removed and the patient was sent for a swallow evaluation.
The swallow study was clinically suspicious for aspiration, so the patient was made strictly NPO.
The patient also underwent a carotid artery study which showed significant plaque through the left internal carotid artery with no focal stenosis and severe narrowing throughout the left ICA.
On postoperative day number six, it was noted that the patient's neurologic examinations were improving.
On postoperative day number seven, the patient underwent an MRA of her carotids which demonstrated a left ICA with total occlusion and a right ICA with 80 to 99% stenosis.
The patient underwent a video swallow on [**2179-2-22**], which she failed and she was to remain NPO with tube feeds through her NG tube.
At that time, evaluation would be made as to whether or not she could resume p.o.
Heparin drip 700 units an hour until therapeutic on Coumadin with an INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq per NG tube twice a day times seven days.
