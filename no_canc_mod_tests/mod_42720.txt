Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION PROCEDURE: Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry of the right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure catheter, advanced to the PCW position through a 8 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections using a 6 French XBLAD 3.5 and a 6 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast injections.
administration of 50 mcg of nitroglycerine.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.

Final angiography demonstrated no dissection, no residual stenosis within the stented segments with loss of a major diagonal branch (closed at the start of the case), and TIMI-3 flow into a diffusely diseased distal LAD.
Arterial time = 1 hour 34 minutes.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a mean RA pressure of 24 mm Hg and mean PCWP of 31 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was markedly reduced, based on an assumed oxygen consumption index.
Central aortic pressure was normal.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Her hematocrit remained stable.
As post MI echo showed akinesis, pt was started on coumadin for a 6 month course after determining she was not a fall risk with physical therapy and with her PCP.

Please monitor Cr levels and potassium levels.
At time of discharge, INR is 1.4 (after 2 doses of coumadin).
