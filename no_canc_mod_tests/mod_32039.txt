COMPARISON: Comparison is made to CT of the head from [**2104-2-28**].
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images were acquired through the brain in the absence of intravenous contrast.
Following injection of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray, contiguous axial CT images were reacquired through the brain.
FINDINGS: Overall, the non-contrast head CT images are unchanged from those done at an outside institution.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Probably stable subarachnoid intraventricular hemorrhage, limited study due to presence of intravenous contrast from prior cerebral angiogram.
Final Report ROUTINE UNENHANCED CT HEAD  HISTORY: Subarachnoid hemorrhage, assess hydrocephalus.
FINDINGS:  The study is performed after a cerebral angiogram.
IMPRESSION:  Limited evaluation due to presence of intravenous contrast from prior angiogram.
Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain before intravenous contrast administration.
Subsequently, contiguous axial imaging was performed during rapid infusion of 75 cc of Optiray 350 intravenous contrast.
Comparison to a head CT of [**2-29**] and a carotid arteriogram of [**2104-2-29**].
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is again seen diffusely in the cisterns, but less prominent than on the prior head CT examination.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Brief Hospital Course: On the [**2-28**] this patient presented to our ED from an outside facility after a CT from the outside hospital revealed diffuse intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A CTA performed at the time of admition did not reveal an underlying aneurysm.
on [**2-29**] she had a four vessel angiogram performed that was essentially negative, the only thing that was questionable was an infindibulum of the PCA.
A CT of the head was performed after the angiogram to rule out hydorcephalus.
A second cerebral angiogram was performed on hospital day #7.
