The LMCA, LAD, Lcx and RCA all had no angiographically apparent disease.
TTE [**2120-1-25**]: Conclusions The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%).
Chest Xray [**2120-1-30**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-29**], monitoring and support devices remain in place.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2120-1-27**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):       Further incubation required to determine the presence or absence of       commensal respiratory flora.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2120-1-29**]):       PROBABLE ENTEROCOCCUS.
Neurological evaluation revealed only minimal neurogical brainstem function.
Occurred in the community setting, and patient was resuscitated by EMS (estimated time to perfusion 20-25 minutes).
He was intubated in the field and initially brought to [**Hospital3 19345**], then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he immediately went for cardiac catheterization, which revealed no significant coronary artery disease.
An echocardiogram obtained the day after admission revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved ejection fraction.
During his cardiac catheterization he showed no signs of meaningful interaction.
His labs were closely monitored for the expected hypokalemia and hyperglycemia during cooling and hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia during rewarming.
Neurological evaluation revealed exam notable only for reactive pupils, intact reflexes, and very slight extensor posturing of his upper extremities in response to painful stimuli.
We monitored his arterial blood gases and attempted to wean his FiO2 to prevent free radial formation; however, the patient began to demonstrate decreased PaO2 requiring higher PEEP and FiO2 to remain adequate.
He was found to have clean coronaries during cardiac catheterization and preserved ejection fraction without significant valvular abnormalities on echocardiogram.
We held his anticoagulation and rate control agents.
# HTN: We held his antihypertensives which were started HD 5 after warming as patient became hypertensive.
