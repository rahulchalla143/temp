CT chest [**2190-4-21**]: CTA CHEST: There is no evidence of filling defects in the pulmonary arteries bilaterally, concerning for pulmonary embolus.
Calcified mediastinal nodes consistent with old granulomatous infection.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old woman with ESRD on HD, no IV access and clotted off IJs and subclavians bilaterally REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please check MRV of the chest to evaluate patency of vessels as it appears bilateral IJs and subclavians are occluded MRA OF THE CHEST.
TECHNIQUE: 3D MRA and MRV post-gadolinium images were acquired.
Reformatted images were generated at a separate dedicated workstation and were essential in the evaluation of the central venous structures.
This correlates with findings seen on the venogram from [**2190-4-28**].
Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  Reason: Please evaluate for epidural abscess and osteomyelitis Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old woman with concern for L2/L3 disciitis, with fevers, increasing back pain, and question of abscess.
MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM  Exam is compared to prior incomplete examination of [**2190-5-2**].
Blood cultures have been clear since [**4-23**].
A preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site.
Initial ultrasound evaluation demonstrated the left internal jugular vein to be thrombosed.
Limited ultrasound evaluation of the left upper extremity demonstrated the left brachial vein to be patent and compressible.
A subcutaneous tunnel was created in the left upper chest using the tunneling device.
The guide wire was removed, and the catheter was placed through the peel-away sheath and positioned with its tip in the superior vena cava.
It was noted on fluoroscopy that as the peel-away sheath was removed, the dialysis catheter tip flipped into the azygos vein.
Final limited chest radiograph confirmed catheter tip position in the superior aspect of the right atrium.
Total of 30 cc of Optiray radiographic contrast was utilized.
Since the previous examinations of [**2189-12-30**] and [**2190-4-3**], there is no significant change in the appearance of the underlying bone.
CT abdomen [**2190-5-12**] INDICATION: Recent angiography with 8-point hematocrit drop.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis without oral or IV contrast.
The study was compared with [**2190-5-1**].
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Fat-containing umbilical hernia is again identified.
Evaluation of the deep pelvic structures is limited by the left hip prosthesis.
Bone windows show no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.
Urine culture showed only genital contamination.
Blood cultures showed growth of G+ cocci so she was started on vancomycin.
Further speciation showed MSSA and she had her HD line removed on [**4-20**].
Blood cultures on [**4-21**] were still positive for MSSA but surveillance cultures were negative after that.
An MRV was subsequently done and showed thrombus in several vessels.
Her WBC also trended up to 24.
She also had an MRI of her L spine that showed osteomyelitis and disciitis at L2/L3.
Patient's blood cultures from [**4-23**] onward were negative for infection.
Her cortisol stimulation test was negative.
As mentioned above, she had her HD line removed on [**4-20**] and received dialysis through a temporary femoral line for several days.
3) DM: Patient's blood sugars were well controlled and she was continued on 7 units of NPH at breakfast and 4 units at dinner.
Podiatry consult debrided left heel ulcer, and took deep wound cultures, which grew pseudomonas.
However, doppler studies were performed, which showed minimal perfusion to the LLE, and patient was taken by vascular surgery to angiography where stents were placed in the left external iliac and superior femoral arteries, with repeat doppler studies showing improved flow.
An abd CT was ordered for further evaluation but pt was refusing this test b/c did not want to drink the contrast.
7) Bilateral pleural effusions: Pt had a left sided effusion with loculated component.
A TSH was checked on [**4-4**] and was 81.
Her thyroxine level was found to be low on this admission and her dose was increased to 225 mcg daily, with repeat thyroid studies to be checked as an outpatinet in six weeks.
A speech and swallow evaluation was obtained and recommended dietary modifications, which patient was unwilling to comply with.
She received 2u pRBC for her hematocrit of 21, and had an appropriate increase in hematocrit.
Hemolysis labs were significant for a low haptoglobin and an elevated reticulocyte count, which was thought to be consistent with recent vascular intervention.
She was briefly taken off coumadin for her vascular procedure, and at time of discharge, awaiting therapeutic INR with goal 2.0 to 3.0. .
-Insulin sliding scale -Ultram 50 mg PO q 12 hrs PRN backpain   Discharge Medications: 1.
Heparin (Porcine) in D5W 100 unit/mL Parenteral Solution Sig: for goal ptt 50-70  Intravenous  ASDIR (AS DIRECTED): until coumadin therapeutic, with INR 2.0 to 3.0.
Upper extremity clots (IJ, subclavian, brachiocephalic) 5.
