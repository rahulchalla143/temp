Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling pressures, mildly elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (35 mm Hg), normal left sided filling pressures (PCWP mean of 8 mm Hg), and mildly elevated systemic arterial pressure (149/71, mean 103 mm Hg).
Cardiac index was low-normal at 2.2 L/min/m2, when calculated by the Fick equation (using an assumed oxygen consumption).
ECHO [**2171-3-29**]: A 4x3cm heterogeneous echogenic mass is seen in close proximity/congruent with the the anterior free wall of the right atrium.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function(LVEF>55%).
If clinically indicated, a TEE, chest CT or cardiac MR may be able to better define the right atrial abnormality.
Chest CTA [**2171-3-29**]: 1) Soft tissue thickening around the right coronary artery, probably in the epicardial space, measuring up to 1 cm on the myocardial side and 2 cm on the pericardial side, which is somewhat hyperdense on the precontrast images.
If clinically indicated confirmation and further characterization could be performed using cardiac MRI.
CXR [**2171-3-29**]: Early congestive heart failure.
Cardiac catheterization [**2171-3-30**]: Selective coronary arteriography revealed no significant coronary artery disease.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2171-3-28**] which revealed tight stenoses in the OM1 and RCA.
The patient then had an echo performed which revealed an incidental finding of an abnormality in the anterior free wall of the right atrium.
This was further investigated by chest CTA and was characterized as an epicardial hematoma.
The patient continued to be asymptomatic, however, the decision was to have her undergo a re look catheterization which she had on [**2171-3-30**].
Repeat cath showed no significant coronary artery disease.
Differential diagnosis included cardiac etiology/demand ischemia, COPD exacerbation, CHF, infectious causes particularly because the patient was on chronic prednisone therapy, PE.
The  had no evidence of decompensated CHF on exam or by cath report.
Her finger sticks were monitored and covered with ISS.
