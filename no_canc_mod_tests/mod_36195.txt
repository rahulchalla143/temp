GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) with hypokinesis of the anterior and lateral apical segments.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen with jets seen at the base of the non coronary/right commisure and right/left coronary commisures..  6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Left ventricular ejection fraction remains similar at 55-60%.
He was admitted and underwent preoperative workup.
He was transfered to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic monitoring.
On post operative day five his hematocrit was 20 down from 22, chest radiology with no evidence of mediastinal widening.
He was transfused with packed red blood cells with hematocrit increased to 25.
His beta blockers were titrated for heart rate control and he was ready for discharge home with services post operative day six.
