TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.
Multiplanar reformatted images were generated.
Lateral ventricles are not enlarged, although comparison with the prior study is not possible at the time of dictation.
No evidence of outlet obstruction at this time, although a comparison with prior CT would be useful to determine interval change.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2107-5-29**] 2:36 PM SCAN FINDINGS: Non-contrast CT of the head demonstrates diffuse cerebral subarachnoid hemorrhage including blood products within the lateral ventricles, third ventricles and filling the fourth ventricle extending through the foramen of Luschka with subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right perimesencephalic cistern.
CTA OF THE HEAD: CTA of the head demonstrates a tiny 2.5-mm outpouching at the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery suggestive of a tiny aneurysm.
The remaining intracranial circulation demonstrates no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, aneurysm or occlusion.
Further evaluation with cerebral angiography is recommended, as clinically relevant.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
ECG Study [**2107-5-30**]  10:08:18 AM Sinus rhythm Nonspecific diffuse ST-T changes.

Unchanged subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage  TTE (Complete) Done [**2107-6-13**] at 2:03:19 PM The left atrium is elongated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-5-30**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly higher and the severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation is slightly higher.

TRANSCATH THERAPY Study Date of [**2107-6-17**] 10:51 AM Evaluation of the right vertebral artery showed moderate stenosis at the origin.
The arteriogram demonstrated mild vasospasm.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2107-6-23**] 4:01 AM Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema have improved since [**6-21**].
CT scan reveled SAH with IVH and HCP.
After the OR she had an emergent CTA of the brain which did not reveal a source of the SAH.
She underwent a TTE which the results are in the results section of this summary.
A Cerebral angiogram was performed on [**2107-5-31**].
MRI did not show any infarcts.
A decision was made monitor her exam for a few more days to see if she improved before considering an open craniotomy.
Her neurological exam vastly improved to following commands by nodding head appropriately to questions correctly and lifting all extremeties off the bed to command.
EVD "fell" out and stat CT showed stable SAH.
Her repeat head CT shows slight increase in lateral ventricle size, but stable.
She tolerated the procedure well and her post-op head CT show no new hemorrhage however she did have further evolution or R cerebellar infarct.
On [**6-17**], angiogram showed good clip placement with mild vasospasm.
On the 23rd and 24th, patient's physical exam improved, she was able to move both upper and lower extremities, but UE<LE.
Patient's physical exam showed she was following commands, mouthing words, and moving lower extremities.
