She continued to see her chiropractor, who performed manipulation of the neck and thoracic spine (between the scapulae) over several visits, with good effect.
The patient states that no diagnostic studies or interventions were performed at that time.
She presented to the [**Hospital 28941**] ER, where had an MRI of the entire spine (without contrast) performed.
There was evidence of cervical cord compression (see details under data), and the patient was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for possible spinal surgery.
MRI of the cervical spine from [**10-13**] (performed in evaluation of persistent bilateral hand tingling, see below) was compared to MRI of the spine performed [**10-26**].
The cervical spine imaging was evaluated with Radiology, and it was felt that there was no significant interval change in the cervical spine or disease elsewhere that could reasonably explain her presentation.
An EMG was reportedly performed in [**Month (only) **] confirming the diagnosis.
She underwent surgery for the carpal tunnel on the right in [**Month (only) 205**] (along with a ganglion cyst removal), but did not have significant relief of symptoms.
The MRI of the C-spine on [**10-13**] was reportedly performed in investigation of these symptoms.
She reports that extensive serologic testing has been unremarkable, though she did have an ESR of 62 in [**Month (only) 216**].
Her symptoms improved on the steroids, and worsened again after they were stopped.
Her Bil IP's are 3-/5, Hamstring on the left is fairly full, Quadriceps are full  bilaterally.
[**Last Name (un) 938**] weaker on left than right  Light touch is reduced from the feet to T4.

She was taken over by the neurosurgical team on [**10-28**] after her MRI imaging of the C&T spine and CT myelogram of the C&T spine were completed.
