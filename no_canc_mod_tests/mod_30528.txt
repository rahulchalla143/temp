Preoperative chest x-ray showed findings consistent with CHF and bilateral pleural effusions.
Preoperative EKG showed sinus rhythm at 70 with a left anterior fascicular block and a possible anteroseptal infarct and nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
Prior to surgery white count rose slightly to 8.0 with a hematocrit of 38.0 and a platelet count of 241,000.
A PTT rose also to 128.8 on Heparin with appropriate adjustments made.
Urinalysis was negative.
He was in sinus rhythm at 104 with a blood pressure of 99/50 and a T max of 102.2 saturating 98 percent still on the ventilator with a cardiac index of 2.63 with an intra-aortic balloon pump in place, remained intubated.
His creatinine dropped slightly to 1.3 with a plan to try and wean his balloon, pull it out, and start to wean him from the ventilator.
Hematocrit rose to 26.2.
Creatinine remained stable at 1.3.
His hematocrit also remained stable.
Platelet count rose slightly from 60 to 69,000.
Patient continued the Lasix diuresis, had a cardiac index of 2.2, and a mixed venous of 72 percent.
He still had decreased breath sounds at the bases, but his exam is otherwise unremarkable with 1 plus peripheral edema and incisions were clean, dry, and intact.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable, blood pressure of 103/46.
Patient's creatinine dropped slightly to 1.1.
His exam is otherwise unremarkable.
His chest tubes had some bibasilar crackles, but his examination was otherwise unremarkable.
On postoperative day five, he received 1 unit of packed red blood cells transfusion for a hematocrit, which then rose to 32.8.
His creatinine continued to drop to 1.0.
He continued with diuresis saturating 95 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula and a stable creatinine at 1.0, and he was transferred to the floor.
By the next day, the patient had a 21-beat run of arrhythmia with a ventricular rate at 90 beats per minute.
His exam was otherwise unremarkable.
His creatinine rose slightly back to 1.4, which was his baseline when he came into the hospital.
He was seen by the Electrophysiology service, who would like to see the patient one month as an outpatient and repeat his echocardiogram and do a Holter monitor study.
Had an episode of hypotension at 6:30 in the morning on the 28th of 70/34 with manual blood pressure with heart rate of 81.
The patient continued to be monitored by telemetry and remained completely stable.
His chest x-ray showed some bilateral pleural effusions with a little bit of atelectasis.
On postoperative day nine, the day of discharge, patient had a blood pressure of 100/34 and sinus rhythm at 83 and a temperature of 97.6, potassium of 4.3, creatinine of 1.4, white count 8.0, hematocrit of 37.4.
The patient will continue to do well despite the single drop of his blood pressure while he was sleeping.
