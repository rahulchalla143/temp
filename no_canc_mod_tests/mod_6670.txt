LV systolic function appears depressed.
Overall left ventricular ejection fraction cannot be reliably assessed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-4-4**], there is no significant change.
Ucx results from rehabd: [**5-6**]: >100,000 pseudomonas, resistant to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ticarcillin-clav sensitive to cefepime, cipro, gent, impipenem, pip, tobra, amikacin, zosyn bcx 5/28,[**5-7**] no growth Sputum [**5-7**] pending Urine [**5-7**]: pending   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 62 M with a h/o aortic coarctation s/p bypass in [**3-13**] complicated by sternal wound dehiscence and RV rupture s/p repair, VRE bacteremia, fungemia, VAP, returning from rehab with fever.
1) Fevers/hypotension: The patient was noted to have rectal temp of 104 at rehab with SBPs in the 80s.
He had blood and urine cultures done and received vancomycin, diflucan, cipro and imipenem there.
The patient remained clinically stable in the ICU and BPs improved with fluid boluses (It appears from previous admission that baseline systolic blood pressures have been in the 90s-130s).
Abdominal CT did not show any source for the abdominal pain and his abd exam was not impressive.
His imaging showed that his stomach has herniated into his thoracic cavity, which could account for his nausea.
He will have to follow-up with CT [**Doctor First Name **] regarding surgical intervention to fix the hernia if/when he has further surgery to fix his chest wall.
CHF: Pt had known CHF, but an echo was re-checked in the setting of hypotension.
Echo showed some LV depression, though an EF was not obtained, but was not significantly changed from before.
He will have to follow-up with CT [**Doctor First Name **] as an outpt.
Hct at baseline appears to be 20-25.
He was transfused one unit of PRBCs during his stay for hct of 20.5. .
