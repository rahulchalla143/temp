The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for a cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient's temperature was 98.6, heart rate of 60, blood pressure of 168/77, respiratory rate of 20, with an oxygen saturation of 99% on 3.5 liters nasal cannula.
Vascular revealed distal pulses were 2+.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Notable laboratories revealed he had a creatine kinase of 72, an MB fraction of 2.2, with an index of 3.1.
The troponin was less than 0.3.
It was felt that his electrocardiogram changes were consistent with his prior inferoposterior/apical myocardial infarction, and that he was now presenting with a troponin-negative unstable angina.
The plan was to continue his intravenous heparin and beta blocker with the intent to send him for a cardiac catheterization on [**8-9**].
This study demonstrated an ejection fraction of approximately 42%, moderate inferior hypokinesis with akinesis of the inferobasilar wall.
The patient had a carotid Duplex study that revealed a 40% narrowing of the right internal carotid artery, and no significant stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
Amiodarone was bolused with a drip started resulting in immediate cardioversion to normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate in the 60s.
He was atrially paced to support his cardiac index and blood pressure with improved hemodynamics.
On postoperative day three the patient remained in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 70s to 90s with occasional premature ventricular contractions.
with adequate oxygen saturation on 2 liters of nasal cannula.
His Lopressor was decreased to 12.5 mg b.i.d., and his Coumadin was at 2 mg with an INR of 2.4.
