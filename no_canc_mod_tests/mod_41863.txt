TTE [**2187-4-10**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Color Doppler study showed a trace shunt across the interatrial septum consistent with a stretched patent foramen ovale (or very small atrial septal defect).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LVEF 50-55%.
EKG without ST elevations but anterior Q waves which could in fact represent a missed STEMI.
Cardiac enzymes consistent with a large territorial infarction.
TTE showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LV EF 50-55%) with mid to apical anterior and apical lateral hypokinesis/akinesis.
Rigors resolved and infectious workup (CXR, urine studies) were negative.
Blood culture final result pending at the time of discharge.
No localizing signs/symptoms, and WBC differential not concerning for acute infection.
CXR and UA also reassuring.
WBC was 7 at time of discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient must continue aspirin indefinitely, and plavix for at least a year - Final result of [**2187-4-9**] blood cultures pending at the time of discharge - Patient has no PCP but was scheduled to see a provider at [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] to establish care.
