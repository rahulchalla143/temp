Prior to his recent pneumonia admission, he had not been on home oxygen, nebulizers, or systemic steroids.
In the ED, initial VS were T 96.6, BP 105/61, HR 110, RR 32, SpO2 100% on NRB.
His labs were notable for WBC 14.0, Hct 31.0, Na 130, and K 7.0 (hemolyzed).
His CXR was grossly unremarkable with no definite acute pulmonary process.
He became hypotensive to 79/58 and was given 3 L NS, with improvement in his pressure to 105/71 and UO 400 ml.
Subsequent CTA showed bilateral lobar and segmental pulmonary emboli, right lower lobe consolidation, and enlarged right heart likely due to right heart strain.
Vital signs on transfer to the ICU were HR 96, BP 100/57, RR 24, and SpO2 98% on NRB.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: VS: BP 115/79, HR 94, RR 16, SpO2 96% on NRB Gen: Elderly male in NAD.
JVP to mid neck lying at 30 degree angle.
Distal pulses intact radial 2+, DP 2+, PT 2+.

Blood culture [**2161-3-27**]: No growth to date.
Urine culture [**2161-3-28**]: No growth.
Sputum culture [**2161-3-29**]: Respiratory flora.
EKG Sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature beats and atrial premature beats.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2161-3-12**] right bundle-branch block and ventricular premature beats are seen on the current tracing.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF 50-60%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
TTE showed mild right heart dysfunction.
He had a chest x-ray with new right sided effusion and increased RLL opacification consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
He was started on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl and with sputum culture growing MRSA, this was weaned to Vanco monotherapy for an expected 10 day course.
Given his history of CAD and therefore known indication for beta-blocker, he was started on metoprolol for rate control, blood pressure control and to reduce atrial ectopy.
His urine lytes and Cr trend suggest a mixed picture with possible intrinsic renal component.
# Knee Fractures: He was seen in [**Hospital 1957**] clinic immediately prior to admission, and evaluation of his fracture showed maintained reduction.
Lab test Obtain INR measurement daily and dose coumadin based upon level for goal INR [**2-26**].
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of a blood clot to the lungs called pulmonary embolism.
Take coumadin as prescribed with INR blood testing every day.
Obtain dosage changes of the coumadin from a doctor based upon the blood test results.
Please take metoprolol for blood pressure and heart rate control.
