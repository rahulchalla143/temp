In the ED her initial vital signs were: T=97.7, BP=129/83, HR=122, RR=20, O2sat=97% RA.
On exam her GCS was 5, and she was intubated for airway protection.
A CT head showed a large left parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with Intraventricular extension and rightward midline shift.
A neurosurgical consultation was obtained, and felt that her chances for meaningful recovery were very unlikely.
Also incidentally noted on laboratory data was a leukocytosis to 18,000 with 23% bands, a CK elevation to 2709 (with normal renal function), and a UA with hematuria only.
A CXR was noted to have bilateral apical opacities concerning for aspiration.
