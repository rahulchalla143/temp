The cardiac silhouette is not included.
TTE [**2165-12-6**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
RUQ ultrasound [**2165-12-11**]: 1.
Extremely limited study; there is suggestion of a nodular liver parenchyma which could correlate with chronic liver disease, but evaluation is markedly limited.
CTA Chest [**2165-12-23**]: 1.
TTE showed EF of 55%, right ventricular cavity enlargment with free wall hypokinesis suggestive of a primary pulmonary process or primary right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was elevated at 36.
His ICU length of stay fluid balance was negative 30 liters.
He was ruled out for MI as source of CHF with cardiac enzymes x 3.
Lower extremity US showed right posterior tibial DVT; PE was suspected but on admission pt's size did not accomodate CTA machine.
In addition, giving ongoing hypoxemia, a bubble study was performed to rule out shunt, but was poor in quality.
Bronchoscopy was performed to investigate bloody secretions that showed likely suction tube induced trauma but no actively bleeding vessels.
He was started on bipap; he tolerated the settings well and follow up with an outpatient sleep study was advised.
Will need INR followed closely.
He will be referred for an outpatient sleep study for exact determination of his BiPAP/ Auto SV pressures which will further need augmentation with nocturnal O2.
In addition on an outpatient basis, alternative etiologies of pulmonary hypertension including chronic thromboembolic disease, portal pulmonary hypertension, and hepatopulmonary syndrome should be explored.
CXR was concering for PNA and he was started on empiric tx with levofloxacin, vancomycin and cefepime initially for VAP.
He completed a 6 day course of antibiotics and WBC was within normal range and he did not have further febrile episodes.
Found to have elevated T. bili, transaminitis and elevated INR 1.7 on admission with nadir to 1.3.
RUQ ultrasound was performed that was limited due to body habitus but was suggestive of nodular liver parenchyma concerning for chronic liver disease, slightly distended gallbladder with  no evidence of gallstones and splenomegaly.
He will need further outpatient evaluation.
Thyroid tests deferred in setting of acute illness.
