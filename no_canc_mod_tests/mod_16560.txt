On initial examination the patient had a heart rate in the 20s to 30s with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further care.
Here an arterial line was placed, and pressors were weaned off with a blood pressure of 150/60 with pacing at 80.
The patient was able to sustain his pressure after the pacer was stopped, even though his intrinsic heart rate was in the 30s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, pulse in the 30s, blood pressure 140/55, vent set at AC, tidal volume is 600, respiratory rate of 14, FIO2 of 80%, PEEP of 5.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.
Neurological: Unresponsive, flaccid, reflexes [**2-7**]+ and symmetric, normal bulk.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 9.1 with 77% neutrophils, 19% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, hematocrit 31.8, platelet count 306.
Sodium 136, potassium 4.6, chloride 106, bicarbonate 14, BUN 40, creatinine 1.7, glucose 312, calcium 7.4, magnesium 1.8, phosphorous 5.3.
PT 28.3, PTT 44.7, INR 5.3.
CK 47, troponin less than 0.3.
Arterial blood gas was 7.24, 36, 178.
Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.015, large blood, 100 protein, trace ketones, leukocyte esterase and urine nitrite negative.
EKG at the outside hospital showed junctional fascicular escape rhythm at 64 beats per minute, retrograde PEs, ST depressions at V2 to V4.
In the Emergency Department here junctional fascicular escape at 36 beats per minute, retrograde PEs, ST depressions in V3 through V5, right bundle branch block pattern.
STUDIES:  Chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed cardiomegaly, bilateral fluffy infiltrates with increased vascular markings.
Transthoracic echocardiogram from [**2185-5-20**] showed an ejection fraction of 45-50%, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, global hypokinesis, no focal wall motion abnormalities, [**2-7**]+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Here an arterial line was placed, pressors were weaned off, pacing was stopped, patient was able to maintain blood pressures at 140/50 even though he still had an intrinsic junctional escape rhythm in the 30s.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient ended up ruling in for myocardial infarction, even though his peak CPK was 109, MB of 16, MB index of 14.7, and troponin I of 4.1.
Even though the patient was able to maintain his blood pressure without the transcutaneous pacer, a temporary pacer wire was placed by the electrophysiologists.
An echocardiogram was performed on [**2185-6-6**].
This showed an ejection fraction of 30-35%.
Left ventricular systolic function was moderately depressed.
Blood pressure:  The patient was initially bradycardic and hypotensive, had to be started on dopamine and Neo-Synephrine.
On these doses, the patient has sustained systolic blood pressures of 100 to 120.
Head CT was performed.
Of note, this head CT was obtained less than 48 hours from the significant event, so anoxic injury could not really be ruled out at that point.
Repeat head scan was done on [**2185-6-8**].
Chest x-ray on [**2185-6-3**] showed a retrocardiac atelectasis/consolidation.
E. coli grew in [**1-12**] blood culture bottles from [**2185-6-3**].
Two days later, we received a report that blood cultures from the outside hospital from [**2185-6-2**] grew two out of two bottles of MRSA.
This particular organism was not present in any of our blood culture vials.
The patient's fever curve resolved and he did not have a white count.
The serous drainage was sampled, and it was noted to have a creatinine of 3.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Given the patient's delirium, there was concern that he may be aspirating.
A bedside evaluation was performed and it was ambiguous.
