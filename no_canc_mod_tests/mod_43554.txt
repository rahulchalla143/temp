CTP [**8-8**]: There is a large area of elevated mean transit time and decreased relative blood flow involving the right middle cerebral artery distribution.
CTA HEAD [**8-8**]: 1.
Acute thromboembolism of the distal M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery, with nonvisualization of the distal branches.
MRA HEAD [**8-8**]: FINDINGS: There is loss of signal of the right middle cerebral artery at the M1 segment with non-visualization of the peripheral branches consistent with occlusion.
The diffusion abnormalities are smaller in extent compared to the perfusion abnormalities seen on the concurrent CT perfusion study.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are prominent but unchanged since [**2110-2-10**].
The diffusion abnormalities are smaller in extent compared to the perfusion abnormality seen on concurrent CT perfusion study.
Short-segment stenosis of the P2 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery  ECHO [**8-9**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion  CT Head [**8-12**]: The previously noted right MCA infarct demonstrates interval evolution, now extending along the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe.
CT Head [**8-13**]: Interval evolution of the right MCA territory infarct which now involves frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe, and causes secondary mass effect with 9- mm subfalcine herniation.
CT Head [**8-14**]: Large evolving right MCA infarct with edema and mass effect, with increased mass effect to the cistern on the right side of the pons and midbrain.
CT Head [**8-15**]: Large right evolving middle cerebral artery territory infarct, with resolution of uncal herniation and improvement in the degree of subfalcine herniation compared to the study of one day prior.
CT Head [**8-17**]: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: PLEASE UPDATE THE DISCHARGE SUMMARY FROM HER ADMISSION UNTIL THE [**8-16**]  STARTING WITH 9/24: Her hospital course by problem is as follows:  Stroke: Her BP was allowed to auto regulate and labetalol was used PRN SBP > 150 or DBP > 95.
Her exam remained unchanged and her head CT showed an evolving stroke.
Her echo showed relatively preserved cardiac function.
Her BP was maintained at higher parameters given her stroke.
