[**2171-8-10**] LUNG SCAN: Indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism with a matched defect in the right mid and lower lobe and associated effusion seen on Xray.
[**2171-8-12**] Echo: Nml left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%) The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
# Anasarca and volume overload: Etiology was felt to be secondary to a combination of liver disease, nephrotic syndrome ([**1-4**] chronic kidney disease), and albumin 1.9 on admission.
Pt's O2sats were 96% on RA.
However, repeat V/Q scan showed low probability.
Renal biopsy did not occur as felt to not significantly change management.
# Pulmonary HTN: Discovered on echocardiogram in the w/u for dyspnea in this pt.
Pt considered not to be a good candidate for right heart catheterization to evaluate possible etiology.
Finding appeared consistent with AIN with urine eos and improvement of Cr.
She continued to have good urine output during this period.
Vancomycin levels were 47, hence stopped and levels monitored.
