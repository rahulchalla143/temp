He states that he was in his usual state of health when he suddenly felt a sharp, substernal chest pain that radiated across his chest bilaterally, and felt unwell.
Glucose was 132 in the field.
Per his pediatric cardiologist from previous notes in [**2162**], TTE showed a structurally normal heart with good contractility, without cardiomyopathy, MVP, or pulmonary hypertension, and normal stress test.
Double contrast esophogram in [**2162**] shows hiatal hernia, no evidence of dysmotility.
In the ED, initial VS were: T97.9 P108 BP160/D R44 O2 sat 100% on NRB.
Labs notable for lactate 4.6, anion gap 18.
The decision was made to intubate and sedate in order to get CT studies done.
CT were negative for traumatic pathology, but he required paralytics to get through CT. LP unremarkable, with normal protein/glucose/WBCs.
On arrival to the MICU, patient quite sedate, not responding to painful stimuli initially.
They recommended MRI of the brain as well as an EEG.
ABG was completely normal.
D-dimer sent and returned elevated at 551.
[**Name2 (NI) **] seizure disorders in the family  Physical Exam: VS: T 99.0, BP 124/84, HR 68, RR 18 and 100%RA GA: AOx3, NAD HEENT: PERRLA.
DTRs 2+ BL (biceps, patellar).

MICROBIOLOGY: Blood cultures x2: no growth to date Urine culture: FINAL - no growth CSF culture: FINAL - no growth .
IMAGING / OTHER STUDIES: CXR ([**2166-12-19**]): IMPRESSION: No acute traumatic injury is seen within the chest.
CT head ([**2166-12-19**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis ([**2166-12-19**]): IMPRESSION: No acute traumatic findings within the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
MRI head w/ and w/o contrast ([**2166-12-20**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial abnormalities.
Echocardiogram ([**2166-12-23**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
EKG ([**2166-12-21**]): Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2166-12-19**] the findings are similar.
He did explain a previous history of "regurgitation" when eating, with an esophageal study in the past, only showing a hiatal hernia and no apparent dysmotility.
An echocardiogram was recommended by the Cardiology team and it showed an ejection fraction of 45% and global dilatation of the ventricles.
He will be followed closely by the electrophysiology team as an outpatient with cardiac MRI and follow-up appointments to further explore this structural abnormality and work-up this apparent dilated cardiomyopathy.
His PCP and GI appointments are in [**2166-12-10**], and cardiac MRI and EP appointments are in [**2167-1-10**].
)(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Cardiomyopathy, based on echocardiogram results Vasovagal syncope  Secondary diagnosis: Anxiety Hiatal hernia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You received CT scans of your head, chest, and abdomen to make sure you were not bleeding anywhere from your fall.
An MRI of your brain was done and it was normal without evidence of stroke or focus of seizure.
An EEG was performed and there was no evidence of seizures.
We performed an echocardiogram, which showed an abnormal reduction in the heart's pumping ability, which will require further evaluation with the cardiologists.
They would like to you get a cardiac MRI before you see them for a follow-up appointment.
The cardiology service (and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will be contacting you with your appointment and with the information about where and when to get your cardiac MRI as an outpatient.
