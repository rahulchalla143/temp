A T-Spine XR on [**1-19**] at [**Hospital1 **] showed possible Fracture, and he was transferred to Caritas [**Hospital3 **] ( [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]) where he had an MRI that showed severe compression fracture at T8 with less severe compression at T9, with complete obliteration of intevening joint space.

Destruction of T8 vertebral body with retropulsion into spinal canal.
CXR [**2112-1-21**]: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: A PIC line enters the chest from the left, can be traced as far as the mid SVC.
Lung volumes are quite low and there is vascular crowding at the lung bases particularly the right, but no focal pulmonary abnormality.
Rightward deviation of the trachea in the neck could be due in part to low lung volumes but suggests an adjacent mass effect, such as a large left thyroid lobe, as confirmed by the thoracic spine CT reported separately, which also showed small pleural effusions not apparent on this conventional radiograph.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
EKG [**2112-1-22**]: Sinus rhythm.
KNEE XR 3 VIEWS [**2112-1-25**]: 1.
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND [**2112-1-26**]: There is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation in the bilateral subclavian and right internal jugular, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2112-1-27**]: The left atrium is moderately elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CXR [**2112-1-29**]: 1.
MRI LEFT KNEE [**2112-1-29**]: 1.
Abnormal appearance of the quadriceps tendon is suboptimally assessed and may reflect old or more recent injury or postsurgical changes; not well differentiated on this study which was optimized for detection of infection.
CT RIGHT SHOULDER [**2112-2-1**]: 1.
CXR [**2112-2-3**]: 1.
His MRI was concerning for possible discitis/osteomyelitis driving the acute fracture.
He went to the OR on [**1-24**] for multiple thoracic laminotomies from T3 to T12 and fusion of T3 to T12.
Please [**Last Name 788**] problem 2 for further management.
[**Name2 (NI) 6**] MRI of the left knee was obtained on [**2112-1-30**], which showed only chronic inflammation without concerning abscesses or fluid collection.
MRI of the right shoulder was attempted due to his history of septic joint, but proved impossible to obtain due to patient's parkinsonism and claustrophobia.
A CT scan of the shoulder was instead obtained, which demonstrated fluid in the right shoulder.
ANEMIA:  His hematocrit was depressed from his baseline of 30 to 21 on [**2112-1-27**].
HCT was stable and improving at time of discharge; patient remained hemodynamically stable.
Doppler ultrasound was negative for DVT.
His pressures recovered to the 120-130 range off of anti-hypertensives.
HYPOKALEMIA:  He is on spironolactone presumably for hypokalemia as an outpatient, which was discontinued in favor of daily potassium supplementation.
His K will be checked with weekly chemistries.
PENDING LABS AT DISCHARGE: None  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: - will require 6 weeks of intravenous nafcillin - needs outpatient follow up with infectious disease, which has been scheduled - weekly labs while on nafcillin (CBC, chem7, AST, ALT, alk phos, CRP/ESR) - titration of blood pressure medications as he regains mobility - acute rehabilitation - daily sterile dry dressing changes to surgical incision sites - patient's code status is FULL code  Medications on Admission: amlodipine 10mg daily androgel 5 grams qday asa 325 qday ferrous sulfate 325mg [**Hospital1 **] hctz 25mg qd vicodin 5-500 q4h prn pain lidoderm patch 1 qday lisinopril 40mg qday metformin 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] metoprolol 25mg qd mvi qday omeprazole 40mg qd ronipirole 3mg q6h spironolactone 25mg qd stalevo 150 6x a day vitamin D 1000U qday   Discharge Medications: 1. testosterone 5 mg/24 hr Patch 24 hr Sig: One (1) Patch 24 hr Transdermal Q24H (every 24 hours).

Fragments of bone from your spine showed that it was infected, and you will require a long course of intravenous antibiotics as an outpatient.
There was no evidence of an ongoing infection in your knee, but a CT scan showed a large fluid collection in your right shoulder.
HOLD amlodipine as your blood pressure has been low while in the hospital.
This can be restarted if your blood pressure remains stable while you are at rehab.
START colace, senna, miralax, and lactulose to help treat constipation 7.
