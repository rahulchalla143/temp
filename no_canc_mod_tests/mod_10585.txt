Cr 1.0, BUN 27, TSH 1.9, WBC 7.3, INR 1.0, PT 12.1 .
Echo [**2130-5-29**]: Normal (LVEF >55%).
CXR [**2130-5-30**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-29**], the pacemaker leads again are in the general area of the apex of the right ventricle and the right atrium.
Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits, and tortuosity of the aorta persists.

Cardiac enzymes were negative and there were no ischemic changes on ECG.
By [**2130-5-31**], orthostasis was gone and physical therapy cleared her to go home with services.
