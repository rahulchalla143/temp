MICROBIOLOGY:  Blood cultures drawn [**2101-1-5**] through [**2101-1-18**] show no growth.
Urine cultures [**2101-1-1**] through [**2101-1-18**] show no growth.
Blood cultures [**2101-1-8**] show no growth, fungus or mycobacteria.
Wound culture of left elbow abrasion [**2101-1-9**] shows no growth.
Pleural fluid culture [**2101-1-11**] shows no growth.
Sputum cultures [**2101-1-5**] through [**2101-1-12**] showed moderate growth of Serratia marcescens.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  Head CT [**2101-1-12**] no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CT of pelvis no evidence of acute injury, small hiatal hernia, left iliac artery mural thrombus calcification, luminal narrowing and ulcerated plaques.
CT of the abdomen with no acute injury.
Chest CT [**2101-1-7**] no evidence of pulmonary embolus, right lower lobe consolidation and pulmonary consolidation of the left lower lobe with fossae of consolidation in the upper lobes bilaterally, emphysematous changes in both lungs.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES PRIOR TO DISCHARGE:  CT of head [**2101-1-19**] no evidence of  hemorrhage.
Chest x-ray [**2101-1-24**] persistent bilateral retrocardiac consolidation persistent rounded opacity in the left inferior hilum, diffuse linear opacity with areas of tram tracking and peribronchial cuffing suggestive of bronchiectasis.
In the MICU the patient became febrile to 102.4 with sputum culture growing Serratia.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral pneumonia and the patient was started on Clindamycin and Levaquin.
The rash, however, remained unchanged and Levaquin was discontinued and the patient was started on Ceftriaxone.
Pleural fluid had 270 white blood cells with 53% polys and 6850 red blood cells.
Pleural fluid culture showed no growth.
The patient maintained oxygen saturation of 95% on 4 liters nasal cannula and the patient was transferred to the floor.
Arterial blood gases done at that time showed a pH of 7.46, PCO2 42, and PO2 of 83 on 100% nonrebreather.
Repeat chest x-ray showed evidence of congestive heart failure and the patient was diuresed over 5 liters with improvement in oxygen saturation.
On hospital day eighteen chest x-ray done showed evidence of congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram was obtained, which showed EF of 45%.
Sputum cultures were positive for Serratia marcescens.
Blood cultures, urine cultures and pleural fluid cultures show no growth.
Repeat chest x-ray on [**2101-1-24**] showed persistent bilateral retrocardiac consolidation, persistent rounded opacity in the right inferior hilum and diffuse linear opacities with areas of tram tracking and parabronchial cuffing suggestive of bronchiectasis.
As the patient remained afebrile with decreasing white blood cell count and decreasing oxygen requirement, no additional course of antibiotics were given.
CT of the head showed no evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
The patient's delirium was likely secondary to ongoing pulmonary infection.
Gastrointestinal:  On hospital day number six the patient's hematocrit decreased from 27.8 to 26 associated with OB positive stools.
Speech and swallow evaluation on hospital day twenty one showed signs of aspiration.
Repeat speech and swallow evaluation on hospital day twenty six showed the patient was able to tolerate po without signs of aspiration.
Repeat lower extremity ultrasound showed extensive thrombus within the left femoral vein with no right sided thrombus.
The patient's peak platelet count on hospital day number twenty two was 1063 and slowly decreased several days prior to discharge.
Platelet count at the time of discharge was 632.
