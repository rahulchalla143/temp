Pt was referred to [**Hospital1 **] for CT surgery evaluation for CABG.
Physical Exam: t98.4, p69, 115/70, rr16, 100% 2L Gen: obese, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, clear OP Neck: suppler, no LAD, JVP of 10cm CVS: RRR, nl s1 s2, no m/g/r Lungs: ctab, no c/w/r Abd: soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM Ext: no edema, 2+ distal pulses  Pertinent Results: [**2139-9-27**] 10:51PM   WBC-10.1 RBC-3.81* HGB-12.3* HCT-35.0* MCV-92 MCH-32.2* MCHC-35.0 RDW-12.7 [**2139-9-27**] 10:51PM   PLT COUNT-207 [**2139-9-27**] 10:51PM   GLUCOSE-129* UREA N-14 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-4.4 CHLORIDE-103 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-11 [**2139-9-27**] 10:51PM   CALCIUM-9.0 PHOSPHATE-3.3 MAGNESIUM-1.8 .
lead placement; ventricular premature complex absent .
[**2139-9-28**]: carotid ultrasound: Duplex ultrasonography was performed at the level of the cervical portions of the bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries.
The velocities, waveforms and velocity ratio in the bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries were normal, with antegrade flow.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
[**2139-9-28**]: Cath 1.
Selective coronary angiography of the left circulation demonstrated a 95% thrombotic stenosis in the mid-LAD with serial 90% and 80%  stenoses in the LCX.
Final angiography demonstrated no dissections, no residual stenoses, and TIMI-3 flow in both vessels.
CAD: 57 year old male with PMH hyperlipidemia, obesity admitted with acute anterior MI and newly diagnosed three vessel disease transferred for evaluation by CT surgery for potential CABG.
Pt was found to have a recent anterior MI with peak troponin of 1700.
We recommend rechecking echo in 3 months, if still has EF<30% in setting of CAD would recommend ICD placement.
