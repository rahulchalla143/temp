Her initial electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with first degree AV block.
She had an echocardiogram that showed a small 5 to 10 cc.
She received intravenous fluids, Atropine and Dopamine transiently and her heart rate increased to the 160s and then decreased to the 130s and then approximately 95.
She was 100% on four liters with a blood pressure of 120/60.
After transfer her vital signs were pulse 80 to 90; blood pressure 125/63; and she reported an occasional five out of ten chest pain that was dull and achy and worse with deep inspiration.
Normal axis, poor R wave progression, QRS 0.96.
Qs in V3 through V6 and evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs at the Coronary Care Unit on presentation:  Blood pressure was 125/63; pulse is 87; she was afebrile; 100% on three liters nasal cannula; 16 breaths per minute.
Pulsus was 8 millimeters of Mercury.
Later electrocardiograms done on the 2nd, were normal sinus rhythm, 81 beats per minute with occasional atrial premature beats, prolonged PR, Qs 1 to 3 centimeters V3 through V6, slight PR depression V2 through V6.
LABORATORY:  Creatinine of approximately 0.7, hematocrit of approximately 33.0.
On presentation, her hematocrit was 35.7. with a white blood cell count of 10.8, hemoglobin 12.8, MCV of 90 and platelets 339.
ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 79 year old woman with a past medical history of peptic ulcer disease status post Billroth II, diverticular disease, syncope and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia who presents from the Electrophysiology Laboratory status post ablation of AVR and AT, complicated by pericardial effusion, decreased blood pressure transiently requiring dopamine.
Echocardiogram showing small stable pericardial effusion.
Blood pressure stable and the pulsus is approximately 8 centimeters.
When her pressure was stable and she was eventually restarted on beta blocker, which was titrated up to 25 mg three times a day and Metoprolol.
She had a repeat echocardiogram on the third of [**2168-5-10**].
Her ejection fraction was estimated to be 60%.
Right ventricular systolic function was normal.
There was a small pericardial effusion that was circumferential and compared to the prior study on [**2168-5-11**], the pericardial effusion appeared slightly smaller than the prior study, and there was no atrial indentation.
We monitored for obstructive physiology by following pulsus which was approximately 8 and jugular venous pressure which was approximately 9.
The echocardiogram was repeated as stated above, earlier.
VALVULAR:  The echocardiogram revealed two plus tricuspid regurgitation.
HEMATOLOGIC:  Hematocrit, coagulation studies and platelets were followed.
On the [**5-12**], the hematocrit was 25.9.
It should be noted that the patient had received intravenous fluids during her episodes of hypotension and the low hematocrit may have represented fluid shifts.
The patient received Tylenol and percocet as well as occasional doses of intravenous morphine for her chest pain.
