Dedicated temporal bone CT is recommended for further evaluation and to evaluate for ossicular injury.
While [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears preserved, if there is a concern for acute infarction, MRI would be recommended.
CT Cervical spine [**2125-1-11**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Otherwise, cervical alignment is preserved.
Right temporal bone fracture with opacification of mastoid air cells in the middle ear and external auditory canal as seen on CT head.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
Compression deformities of T8 and L1 of indeterminate chronicity.
MRI Cervical and Lumbar spine IMPRESSION: 1.
Although evaluation for subtle fractures would be difficult on MRI, no obvious abnormalities are seen on recent CT.  LUMBAR SPINE:  TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial images of the lumbar spine were acquired.
FINDINGS: At T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1, mild degenerative change is seen.
A disc protrusion in the left foramen results in severe foraminal narrowing.
He was admitted to the Trauma Service and underwent CT imaging showing bilateral subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhages, right mastoid fracture, right lateral rib fractures, L1 transverse process fracture, L2 severe compression fracture of undetermined chronicity.
He was admitted to the ICU for observation;  Neurosurgery was consulted, serial head CT scans were followed and he was given Dilantin.
A repeat CT obtained [**1-12**] was unchanged.
Because of his injuries he did have pain control issues, the Acute Pain service was consulted for epidural catheter placement.
A PEG was placed for nutritional support given that he failed his bedside swallow evaluation.
As his mental status improves he should have a repeat swallow evaluation performed.
Piperacillin-Tazobactam-Dextrs 4.5 gram/100 mL Piggyback Sig: 4.5 Grams Intravenous Q8H (every 8 hours) for 11 days.
Inform the office that you will need a repeat head CT for this appointment.
