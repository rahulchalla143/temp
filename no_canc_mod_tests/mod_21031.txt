Blood cultures were drawn at rehabilitation, and she received 1 gram of cefepime intravenously en route.
Urinalysis was consistent with a urinary tract infection.
An abdominal computed tomography showed no diverticulitis but a question of left lower lobe consolidation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed her temperature was 103.8 degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 146/80, her pulse was 136, her respiratory rate was initially 34 and later 16, her oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the mucous membranes were slightly dry.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 1 to 2+ bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Complete blood count revealed her white blood cell count was 19.8 (with 90% neutrophils and 5% lymphocytes), her hematocrit was 33.9, and her platelets were 432.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 135, potassium was 5.1, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was 186.
Aspartate aminotransferase was 32, her alanine-aminotransferase was 15, her alkaline phosphatase was 117, and her total bilirubin was 0.4.
Her lipase was 14 and amylase was 17.
Albumin was 2.6.
Lactate was 2.8.
Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.018, large blood, nitrite positive, moderate leukocyte esterase, 500 protein, trace ketones, more than 50 red blood cells, and more than 50 white blood cells.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the abdomen revealed no appendicitis.
A chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe consolidation.
FEVER ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from [**Hospital6 85**] grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was planned for [**2-7**], but it could not be performed because of lack intravenous access and the patient's confusion.
Therefore, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on [**2-9**] which showed global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 25%; most consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.
A magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine was a poor study because of motion artifact that showed abnormal signal from L1 to L5 with probable epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, and L5-S1 discitis.
On [**2-17**], the patient was placed under general anesthesia and had a repeat magnetic resonance imaging to further delineate the focus of infection.
BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  As mentioned, the patient had blood cultures positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
From [**2-8**] through [**2-11**], repeat blood cultures were sterile.
On [**2-15**], gentamicin was discontinued because her creatinine increased to 1.6.
A chest x-ray showed bibasilar atelectasis that had increased on the right along with a right-sided effusion.
Her oxygen saturation was 98% on a 35% face mask.
A sputum culture grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that was resistant to levofloxacin and sensitive to piperacillin tazobactam.
The patient's oxygen saturation improved, and on [**2-14**] was up to 99% on 1 to 2 liters.
Her secretions improved on [**2-14**] and were essentially resolved by [**2-15**].
On [**2-17**], the piperacillin tazobactam was discontinued because of a concern of acute interstitial nephritis.
Her ventricular rate was in the 150s, but she was not hemodynamically unstable.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was found to have an ejection fraction of 25% and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had deteriorating renal function from [**2-13**] when her creatinine was 1.1 to [**2-17**] when it was 2.1.
Urine eosinophils were positive but rare.
Her fractional secretion of sodium was 6.9%, so a prerenal problem was unlikely.
She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**2-8**] when her hematocrit was 27.5.
Her hematocrit increased appropriately with the transfusion.
COAGULOPATHY ISSUES:  The patient had an INR of approximately 2 for the first and second weeks of her hospitalization which was likely secondary to malnutrition and vitamin K deficiency in her diet.
She was given vitamin K and the coagulopathy resolved.
