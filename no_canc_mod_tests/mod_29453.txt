LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Conclusions: PRE-BYPASS:  1.The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Peak velocity across the aortic valve is 1.7 m/s, with a mean gradient of 10 mm of Hg.
Cross clamp time was 68 mins., and total bypass time was 97 mins.
His chest tubes were d/c'd on POD#1 and pacing wires were d/c'd on POD#3.
