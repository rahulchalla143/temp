PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING: Cardiac catheterization showed left vein and 3-vessel disease with an ejection fraction of 45%.
Cardiac catheterization today just showed left vein 60% left anterior descending artery, 60% to 80% first diagonal, 100% left circumflex, and 90% ostial right coronary artery.
His preoperative chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination, blood pressure was 166/77, oxygen saturation was 100% on room air, respiratory rate was 18, and heart rate was 55.
His abdominal examination was benign with good bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  His creatine kinase peaked at [**Hospital3 3583**] at 384 with a troponin of 8.35.
His preoperative laboratories were as follows; white blood cell count was 5.8, hematocrit was 36.5, and platelet count was 162,000.
Prothrombin time was 13.1, partial thromboplastin time was 40.9, and INR was 1.1.
Sodium was 134, potassium was 3.9, chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 22, creatinine was 0.9, and blood glucose was 87.
ALT was 22, AST was 28, alkaline phosphatase was 64, total bilirubin was 0.5, and albumin was 3.7.
Creatine kinase was 270 followed by 320.
Troponin was 8.3.
Additional echocardiography showed an ejection fraction still approximately 35% to 40% with moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic insufficiency, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation and aortic regurgitation.
He was unresponsive on examination and was successfully sedated.
His heart rate was 98.
He was atrially paced with a blood pressure of 93/41.
He was fully supported by the ventilator with a blood gas of 7.27/35/41/17/-9.
Temperature maximum was 93.9.
Hematocrit was 20.8.
His blood pressure had increased to a mean arterial pressure of greater than 70, but the prognosis was very poor.
Blood pressure dropped with the fluid removal.
The patient received two units of packed red blood cells, and his positive end-expiratory pressure was increased.
Heart rate was 76, A-paced.
Blood pressure was 118/48.
Blood gas that morning was 7.47/26/63/19/-2 with a temperature maximum of 99.5.
White blood cell count was 16.7.
Hematocrit was 45.
Platelet count was 121.
Sodium was 132, potassium was 4.6, blood urea nitrogen was 22, creatinine was 2.3, chloride was 97, bicarbonate was 18, and blood glucose was 104.
His blood urea nitrogen was 27 with a creatinine of 2.6.
His hematocrit dropped from 48 to 32.2.
The TE showed some right ventricular function remaining.
A pericardial clot was evacuated at the bedside, and his pressure dropped slightly.
