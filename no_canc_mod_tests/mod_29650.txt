Her initial EKG in the setting of hypotension demonstrated deep ST depressions in the precordial leads, V2-V4, and she was found to be in complete heart block.
She was taken emergently to the catheterization suite where she was found to have elevated filling pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 30 and notably prominent V waves indicative of mitral regurgitation.
A left heart catheterization revealed a left dominant system with a small and diffusely diseased RCA, a total occlusion of the proximal left circumflex artery, and a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD.
She was shocked to a sinus rhythm and then underwent successful stenting of the LAD lesion.
She had a positive stress test in [**2159**] consistent with inferior ischemia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 110/53, heart rate 81, in sinus, 02 saturation 96%.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Her groin sites were stable post cath.
Her vent settings on admission to the Coronary Care Unit were assist control with tidal volume 500 and respiratory rate of 12.
Her lines upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit included a right IJ Cordis, left femoral artery intra-aortic balloon pump and a right femoral venous Swan line, all of which were competent.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 17.7, hematocrit 40, platelets 304,000.
Sodium 141, potassium 4.2, chloride 111, bicarbonate 19, BUN 21, creatinine 1.0, glucose 236.
PT 12.7, PTT 24.5, INR 1.0.
ABGs 7.19, 36, 71.
EKG post procedure revealed normal sinus rhythm at 91 beats per minute with an indeterminate axis and a QTC of 476, QRS duration 150, right bundle branch block with ST depressions in V2 to V4 of 3 mm consistent with a posterior MI.
EKG preprocedure at 8:02 a.m. revealed sinus rhythm with AV dissociation consistent with complete heart block, ventricular rate of 41, right bundle branch block, and [**Street Address(2) 11741**] depression in V2 to V4.
A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated residual ejection fraction of 30% with overall LV systolic function moderately to severely depressed with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior free wall, posterior wall, and lateral wall, as well as moderate 2+ aortic regurgitation and mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.
q.d., hold for a systolic blood pressure of less than 100 or heart rate less than 60.
t.i.d., hold for SBP less than 100.
Status post cardiac catheterization with percutaneous coronary intervention of the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries with stent placement.
