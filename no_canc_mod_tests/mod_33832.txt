IMAGING CT chest [**4-25**] 1.
CT head [**4-25**] No CT evidence for acute intracranial process.
CTA chest [**4-21**] 1.
ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
A chest CTA was done in the ED that did not show PE but did show some fibrotic process.
He had a CXR in the ED that showed LLL consolidation and treatment for healthcare acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn were started.
Initially there was some concern for acute on chronic congestive heart failure as a cause of his respiratory distress, diuresis did not improve his symptoms, BNP was not elevated and echo was unimpressive.
A repeat CT chest was done for concern of the fibrotic changes on his inital CT.
# Hypotension:  His blood pressure decreased to MAP 60 after intubation, thought to have been [**1-18**] medications given during intubation v. PEEP impeding venous return.
Urine lytes revealed a FeNa of <0.1%, UNa <10, no casts on sed, urine eos neg.
# Hyperglycemia: AAfter initiation of high dose steroids his blood sugar levels increased, likely [**1-18**] steroids.
# Hypernatremia:  Two days after initiating tube feeds his serum sodium became elevated, likely secondary to decreased free water intake, improved with increased free water boluses.
# RBBB:  He has an old EKG from [**2135**] with RBBB.
#Anisocoria-pt was noted to have uneven pupils on HD 3, concern for ICH given anticoagulation with lovenox but given unstable clinical status head CT was delayed.
On [**4-25**] head CT was normal, also family stated he has had this for some time.
You had a chest CT scan that showed likely IPF.
