EGD was significant for blood clot with oozing, as described in the HPI.
Hematocrit remained stable at 31-32 over the next 24 hours.
Hematocrit remained stable without requirement of further blood tranfusion.
He will have repeat EGD in 2 weeks with gastroenterology.
Blood cultures and Urine cultures were negative.
3) RBBB: Seen on EKG in the ED, which was new since his NSTEMI at OSH, but he was noted to have previous evidence of RBBB in the setting of tachycardia.
4) Hypertension: Once his blood pressure normalized, he was re-started on his outpatient regimen of lisinopril, HCTZ and triamterene.
His blood pressures on this regimen were 100-110 systolic.
Initial portable CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia and the patient defervesced the following morning.
Antibiotics were initially held, however repeat CXR PA&Lat showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia.
He continued to appear well without fever and his WBC count trended back down from 18.6 to 9.8.
6) Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia with sodium falling acutely from 139 to 123 over a 24 hour period.
However, his sodium levels continued to drop precariously to 111.
Aggressive water restriction was continued and his sodium normalized quickly to 132 by the end of the day.
With persistent education and water restriction sodium remained >130 through the remainder of his hospital course.
