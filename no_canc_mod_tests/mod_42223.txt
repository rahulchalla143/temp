He had a Persantine MIBI in [**9-7**] for unstable angina which showed only a small fixed inferior defect which was thought to be artifact and an ejection fraction of 63%, now presenting with worsening exertional chest pain and shortness of breath for the last month.
He had CPR for two minutes and was started on dopamine transiently for low blood pressure and regained normal sinus rhythm.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.6, heart rate 67, blood pressure 119/69, respirations 15, saturating 99% on room air.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
There was 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, 2+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 10.6, hematocrit 36.9, platelets 152,000.
Chemistries revealed a sodium of 145, potassium 4.3, chloride 105, bicarbonate 28, BUN 21, creatinine 1.2, glucose 100, INR 1.0.
The EKG was normal sinus rhythm, rate of 70, normal axis and intervals, Q waves present in leads III and aVF, ST elevations of 3 mm in II, III, and aVF and biphasic T present in V6.
Persantine MIBI in [**9-7**] showed mild fixed inferior defect, ejection fraction of 63%.
His cardiac catheterization this admission showed a right atrial pressure of 5, pulmonary artery pressure of 16, right ventricular pressures of 23/6, pulmonary capillary wedge mean pressure of 9.
Cardiac output of 3.26, cardiac index of 1.71.
Left ventriculogram showed normal ejection fraction with no mitral regurgitation.
LAD showed mild in-stent occlusion, distal filling via LIMA.
Left circumflex showed distal subtotal occlusion with small distal vessel, RCA showed an occluded PDA and mid PL branch, both filling via saphenous vein graft.
ACUTE INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION SECONDARY TO DISTAL EMBOLIZATION DURING PCI:  EKG after catheterization showed residual ST elevation in II, III, and aVF.
Peak CKs were in the 2,000 range with no evidence of RV infarction by right heart catheterization.
HYPOTENSION:  The patient was transiently hypotensive during catheterization and was placed on dopamine temporarily which was discontinued after the patient left the catheterization laboratory.
HYPERTENSION: The patient's blood pressure was well controlled.
Blood cultures were drawn.
On the day of discharge, his fever had improved and his white count came down.
