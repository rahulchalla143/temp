At [**Location (un) **], the patient was found to have a hematocrit of 11% which rose to 19% after eight units of packed red blood cells.
Platelets were 47 to 26 and PT was 17.3, PTT 33.5.
His blood pressure was 97/54, heart rate in the 90s with saturations 95% on two liters nasal cannula.
He had a head CT scan that was negative and a CT scan of the abdomen where there was some question of retroperitoneal varices and soft tissue swelling of the left leg.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On examination, temperature 99.5 F.; blood pressure 135/79; heart rate 94; respiratory rate 16; oxygen saturation 96% on two liters nasal cannula.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  White count 6.8, hematocrit 19.4, platelets 61, fibrinogen 98, D-dimer positive.
INR 2.2.
PTT 33.5, 73% polys, 17% lymphocytes, 6% bands, 4% monocytes.
Chem-7 with sodium of 135, potassium 3.5, chloride 100, bicarbonate 24, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 78, calcium 7.1, magnesium 2.0, phosphate 2.5, albumin 2.4, total protein 6.2, total bilirubin 7.9, direct bilirubin 3.2.
ALT 34, AST 99, alkaline phosphatase 102.
GGT 100, LDH 334.
CK 372, troponin I less than 0.04.
Head CT scan was negative for bleed, reviewed by Radiology here at [**Hospital1 69**].
Chest x-ray shows chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and no acute process.
Abdominal CT scan shows cirrhosis with no clear evidence of retroperitoneal varices or retroperitoneal hematoma but shows a left gluteal hematoma.
FALLING HEMATOCRIT:  The patient presented initially with a hematocrit of 11% and an INR of 4 with a left lower extremity hematoma.
His CT scans were reviewed here and were consistent with a left gluteal hematoma, but no retroperitoneal bleeding and no gross evidence of gastrointestinal bleed.
His hematocrit was stabilized here and improving.
Transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for any evidence of endocarditis.
He is to have a tagged white blood cell scan on Monday, [**1-22**].
He had no tenderness to palpation of his spine and no meningeal signs.
No ascites by CT scan.
DECREASING MENTAL STATUS:  This initially was thought to be alcohol withdrawal and he was initially Ativan responsive, presenting with an increased heart rate and blood pressure.
Fresh frozen plasma was given to decrease his INR less than 1.6 for bleeding from his A-line site.
