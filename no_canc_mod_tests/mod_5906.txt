EKG found to have STE in V2, V3, aVf, V3-6 with STD in V1-2.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2188-2-9**] atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response has appeared.
STE in V2, V3, aVf, V3-6 with STD in V1-2.
Imaging: CXR ([**2191-7-7**]) No definite evidence of consolidation.
However, examination of the left lower lung fields is limited secondary to overlying hiatal hernia.
CXR ([**2191-7-12**]): The right PICC line tip is in the inferior portion of superior vena cava.
CXR ([**2191-7-13**]): Left lung has reexpanded, though the base is chronically elevated by a large diaphragmatic hernia containing stomach and intestine.
CXR ([**2191-7-14**]) New collapse of left upper lung.
CXR ([**2191-7-15**]) Re-expansion of left upper lobe.
Echocardiogram ([**2191-7-7**]): The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears depressed secondary to extensive apical akinesis.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Echocardiogram ([**2191-7-12**]): Conclusions: Focused study.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-7-7**], there has been some improvement in the contractility of the distal [**12-14**] of the left ventricle,however the rest of the walls are no longer hyperkinetic.
Pulmonary arterial pressure is similar.
UCx [**2191-7-7**] URINE CULTURE (Final [**2191-7-10**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
BCx [**2191-7-7**] (total of 4 bottles) No growth.
SCx [**2191-7-8**] Contaminated, culture cancelled  Brief Hospital Course: 88 y/o female with h/o HTN and no prior h/o CAD presents with vomiting/loose stools and found to have STEMI and guaiac positive stools.
- Pump The patient was found to have an EF of 50% by echocardiography.
The patient's initial echo on dopamine gtt revealed extensive apical akinesis; the basal and midventricular segments were markedly hyperdynamic, resulting in a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Repeat echo revealed some improvement in the contractility of the distal [**12-14**] of the left ventricle and the rest of the walls were no longer hyperkinetic.
Hematocrit remained stable in mid-30s.
She had CXRs on [**2191-7-13**] and [**2191-7-15**] which showed collapse of the entire left lobe [**1-13**] mucous plugging and atelectasis.
Aggressive chest PT will be recommended upon discharge.
