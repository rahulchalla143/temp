Trends: Hct: 20.5 - 22.3 - 29 - 29 Creatinine 3.2 to 3.7 by discharge CK: [**Medical Record Number 107493**] - 63 - 66 - 64 CKMB: 6 Trop: 0.08 - 0.07 - 0.09 - 0.10 - 0.11 - 0.10 A1c: 6.7 CXR: R pleural effusion, mildly increased pulmonary vasculature  .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-8-21**], left ventricular function now appears improved.
Of note, patient in sinus rhythm for the current study (in aflutter with rapid ventricular response in prior study).
# Hypertensive emergency: Patient came in with SBP in the 200s.
His blood pressure was initially controlled with a labetalol drip but he was switched to his home regimen shortly into his stay.
His SBP was 120-140 throughout the rest of his stay.
# Anemia: Patient had a HCT of 20 on admission in the setting of hematemesis.
He received another 3u PRBCs and his HCT stabilized between 27-30.
He had an EGD which showed no active bleeding but multiple AVMs.
We controlled his blood pressure and the patient did not experience any further drop in his HCT.
His troponins trended as above with a peak of 0.15.
His chest pain was nonexertional and it was associated with point tenderness.
An echo done on [**10-3**] showed resting regional wall motion abnormalities include with inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis and an EF of 40-45%.
# Acute renal failure:  The patient has a baseline Creatinine of 2.5-2.7.
His Cr was 3.2 on admission and was 3.6 upon discharge.
His ARF was thought secondary to hypoperfusion/ischemia/intrinsic renal disease.
# Alcohol abuse/substance abuse: We started a CIWA scale and counseled the patient on the importance of changing his habits.
