LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Her  troponin peaked to 1.75, CK MB 12.5 and cardiac catheterization that showed three vessel coronary artery disease.
She underwent preoperative work up and went to the operating room for coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
