The patient was sent for a Stat Head CT which was consistent with large hyperacute hemorrhage in the left temporal region.
Skin - incision is clean/dry/intact CV: rr, S1 and S2 nl Pulm: CTAB, no w/c/r, no cough with forced expiration GI: soft, nt/nd, +BS Extr: no c/c/e Neuro: AAO x 3, PERRL, EOM intact, face symmetric, no pronator drift, strength 5/5 bilaterally, sensory intact  Pertinent Results: CT head [**2161-8-7**] 5.5 (AP) x 3.4 (CC) hyperacute hemorrhage in the left temporal region.
CXR [**2161-8-7**] 1.
CT head [**2161-8-7**] Unchanged size of left extra-axial temporal hemorrhage, likely traversing both epidural and subdural compartments in this postoperative patient.
CT head [**2161-8-8**] Previously noted epidural hematoma is evacuated without significant residual hematoma  Echocardiogram [**8-11**]  Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary hypertension  CT Head [**8-12**] There is a new area of hyperdensity, approximately 5mm in thickness, above the tentorium on the left side likely representing subdural blood.
His exam deteriorated and he required intubation.
CT head was repeated and was without change.
CXR showed bibasilat atelectasis.
He returned to the ICU and post-op scan showed a good decompression.
Cardiology was consulted regarding AFIB and they recommended an echo which was ordered prior to transfer.
A UA was positive and culture was sent on [**8-8**] and culture demonstrated no growth and he was not started on treatment.
Echo demonstrated normal EF and no abnormalities.
He had persistent headches and repeat CT showed a small 5mm area of hemorrhage but no mass effect.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
