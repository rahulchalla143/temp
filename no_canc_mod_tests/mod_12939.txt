At the outside hospital, the patient had extensive Infectious Disease work-up because of persistent high fever, including blood cultures which remained negative including fungal cultures, a liver biopsy that showed a granulomatous hepatitis, bone marrow biopsy that showed increasing eosinophils, flow cytometry on the bone marrow biopsy showed no acute leukemia or lymphoma.
A CT scan of the abdomen showed splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, prominent mediastinal lymph nodes and a gallium scan that was negative.
An ACE showed to be elevated at 115.
The patient had a total of ten units of platelets, two units of packed red blood cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma during that admission and the patient was discharged on [**11-1**], but re-presented on [**11-2**] with increasing shortness of breath and fever to 104.0 F.  At the outside hospital, the patient was started on Zosyn, Diflucan, and Vancomycin for empiric treatment and the patient also had significant hypotension and dopamine was started prior to the transfer of the patient to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for further work-up.
The patient also had a worsening acidosis with an arterial blood gases of 7.30, pCO2 of 29, pO2 of 90, and an elevation of lactate to 3.0, and given the worsening acidosis and patient's tachypneic appearance, the patient was subsequently intubated for compensation of his acidosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs with heart rate of 124; blood pressure 94/42; respiratory rate of 30; oxygen saturation 93% on four liters nasal cannula and a weight of 91 kilograms.
LABORATORY:  Pertinent for a hematocrit of 26.9, white blood cell count of 3.4, platelets of 36, INR of 1.6, fibrinogen 400, total bilirubin 15.7, albumin at 2.5, calcium of 6.6, lactate of 3.0.
Arterial blood gases 7.30, 29, and 90.
ALT 84, AST 140, alkaline phosphatase 192, lipase 18, amylase 19, bicarbonate 15.
Potassium was 4.6, creatinine of 3.9, BUN 86.
Urinalysis with 1.025, large blood, positive nitrites, positive glucose, 100 protein, trace ketones, large bilirubin, trace leukocyte esterase, 11 to 20 red blood cells, 3 to 5 white blood cells.
The patient was started on a sodium bicarbonate drip on hospital day two for a bicarbonate of 9.
With improvement of his metabolic acidosis and maximal ventilatory support, abdominal CT scan on hospital day three showed no splenomegaly, no perforations or free air.
Also, component of DIC with elevation of his coagulations and low fibrinogen.
The patient was transfused with blood products to support a hematocrit greater than 30 and INR less than 1.5, and platelets greater than 50 given his continued bleeding during this hospital stay.
We are currently in the process of obtaining a bone marrow biopsy from the outside hospital which is now at the [**Hospital6 1129**] being examined by their pathologists.
Elaborate work-up is currently pending and the patient was initiated on broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin, Meropenem, doxycycline, Levaquin, and Caspofungin for empirical broad coverage.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The Infectious Disease consultation team assistance was requested in the management of this patient and the patient had an elaborate work-up including multiple serologies for CMV, EBV, as well as numerous Zoonotic diseases that are currently pending at this time.
Cultures and serologies are negative to the date of this dictation on [**2115-11-10**].
Biopsies of the liver were sent to [**Hospital6 1129**] pathology for further work-up and with communication with these pathologists, it was thought that this was not a primary liver process, but a disseminated process.
The liver team is attempting to obtain liver biopsy slice from the outside hospital.
Abdominal ultrasound was negative.
The patient had an abdominal CT scan that was also unrevealing for any primary process.
The patient's calcium was repleted with a drip as well as total parenteral nutrition with improvement of his calcium on the day of this dictation.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION:  The patient had an echocardiogram initially with mild to moderate pericardial effusion noted.
A repeat echocardiogram showed improvement of the fluid as well; however, in the setting of decreased calcium, the patient also was noted to have on the repeat echocardiogram an ejection fraction of 30%.
A follow-up echocardiogram will be needed to reassess.
