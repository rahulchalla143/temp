Her nasogastric lavage was negative.
Congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in [**2169-12-13**], with one plus mitral regurgitation, two plus tricuspid regurgitation, normal wall motion and ejection fraction.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of between 1.2 and 1.5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, blood pressure 186/70 with a heart rate of 65; respirations 18 with 98% on room air.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count of 12.9, hematocrit of 42.2 which was up from 32.8 on [**1-16**].
Platelets 298; 89% neutrophils, 7% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes, 1% eosinophils.
PT 17.2, PTT 24.7, INR 1.9.
Sodium 141, potassium 4.6, chloride 105, bicarbonate 21, BUN 55 up from 51 and creatinine of 2.0, up from 1.8, all from [**1-22**] that was increased.
Glucose 245, troponin 0.5.
Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.009, small blood, moderate leukocyte esterase, two red blood cells, 35 white blood cells, many bacteria.
EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 68, normal axis, normal intervals, T wave inversions in II, III, AVF, V4 through V6.
Compared with [**1-18**] where there were T waves from lead V4 through V6 which are new.
Because of an elevation in her creatinine for an acute on chronic picture, a CT scan without contrast was done.
The CT scan at that time was a limited study given that there was no intravenous contrast.
These findings were thought to be concerning, but because a more specific study with contrast could not be performed at the time she was continued to be treated empirically on antibiotics; since she was hemodynamically stable, she was followed without any further intervention.
There was a plan to have a follow-up CT scan with contrast to further appreciate the cause of her bright red blood per rectum while she was on her Coumadin, however, that was complicated by a PEA arrest, so the study could not be done.
She had a follow-up flexible sigmoidoscopy done which showed findings consistent with melanosis coli, but there were no clear reasons why she had suffered from bright red blood per rectum.
It was thought that when she was more stable and her acute medical issues were resolved and she was out of the Intensive Care Unit, that she would benefit from a full colonoscopy and/or a video study to further evaluate her gastrointestinal tract.
An ultrasound was done of the gallbladder which showed stable cholelithiasis but no evidence of cholecystitis.
At that time of this dictation, the patient's bright red blood per rectum had resolved; she was guaiac negative and her hematocrit was stable.
CARDIOLOGY:  The patient was status post recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with a catheterization and no intervention.
twice a day and her medications are being titrated up as her blood pressure tolerates.
The first PEA arrest occurred during her CT scan when she was administered intravenous contrast.
In order to treat the patient's obstructive sleep apnea, it is important that she sit relatively high with her head of bed elevated 45 degrees, so that the girth of her abdomen is not weighing upon her chest wall and subsequently causing more difficulties in her breathing status.
A full work-up was done to find the etiology of her sepsis, which had required pressors and she had a pan-CT of her body to look for any signs or symptoms of infection including pneumonia, abdominal abscess, colitis.
She had a lower extremity CT scan to see if she had any evidence of seeding infection to her knee where she had prior surgery; however, the CT scans were essentially negative and it was not clear exactly the source of her sepsis.
She required occasional transfusions with goal transfusion of hematocrit of greater than 27.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and she was kept on an insulin drip for most of her hospital stay given that the goal fingersticks were between 80 and 120 in the acute care setting.
