CT chest - IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
multiple pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes at multiple stations  ECHO TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-4-24**], the findings are similar.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2122-7-2**]):       OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
1) Hypoxia: The patient presented with bilateral infiltrates, fever, and markedly elevated WBC count with bandemia and imaging was consistent with a multilobar pneumonia.
Sputum cultures revealed MRSA.
His CT appeared to show a tracheo-esophageal fistula but on review of the images this was thought to unlikely.
He passed a bedside and video-swallowing eval and showed no sign of aspiration.
His INR was reversed on arrival but was brought back to therapeutic after he stabilized.
His creatinine normalized rapidly with fluid repletion and treating his pneumonia.
