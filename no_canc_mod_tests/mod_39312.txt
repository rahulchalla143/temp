Describes retrosternal chest pressure accompanied by tachycardia and headache.
Per patient recording, systolic blood pressure was in 200s.
Patient given ASA 325mg and SLN x 3 which brought pain from [**8-26**] to [**3-26**] but also caused hypotension to SBP of 74.
EKG showed old LBBB with no other evident ST changes, CXR wnl.
Initial labs remarkable for Cr of 1.3, trop 0.04.
Catheterization showed diffuse atherosclerosis with likely acute occlusion of left circumflex OM2, and significant stenoses in distal LAD and Diag 1.
Angioplasty of OM2 branch was complicated by dissection (no evidence of perforation) and attemts to stent thrombosed area were aborted.
On review of systems, she complains of intermittent uncontrolled blood pressure for the for the past 2 yrs with BP as high as 200s.
Thorough evaluation revealed renal artery stenosis with normal urinary metanephrines and aldosterone.
