The patient was concerned he was having a heart attack so he had EMS called from his health club and was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where EKG was consistent with STEMI.
He had PTCA, thrombectomy, and stenting with a DES followed by a right heart cath that revealed essentially normal pressures.
Post-cath EKG had essentially normalized.
On arrival to the CCU he reports minimal chest pain, no shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or other complaints.

CARDIAC CATH [**1-15**]: 1.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures with mean PCWP of 15 mmHg.
The right sided pressures were normal, and the cardiac output was normal.

CXR [**1-16**]: No active disease in the chest.
TTE [**1-17**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
TTE showed normal LVEF.
His heart rate was in the 40s-50s at rest, which increased appropriately to 70s with activity.
His lipid profile showed Chol-106 Triglyc-36 HDL-52 CHOL/HD-2.0 LDLcalc-47.
