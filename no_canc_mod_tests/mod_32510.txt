The indication for the patient's colonoscopy on [**1-10**] was that he was intermittently having blood coating his stools.
He had a total of [**7-21**] episodes of watery, BRBPR before reporting to an OSH where his Hct was measured to be 37.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because his original GI procedure took place here and his Hct upon arrival had fallen to 31.7.
In general the patient appeared well and his exam was benign.
His Hct fell to 31.7 from 37 at the OSH but he did not have any further episodes of BRBPR.
Upon transfer to the floor, his VS were P=78, BP=107/66, RR=19, and POx=100% 2L .
