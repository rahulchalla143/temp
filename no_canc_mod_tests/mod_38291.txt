An echocardiogram revealed vegetation on the aortic and mitral valves in the setting of a positive UTI and a new diagnosis of a non functioning right kidney.
Most recent urine culture was negative.
Past Medical History: Asperger syndrome Endocarditis with significant aortic insufficiency Atrophic non functioning right kidney, s/p Right laparoscopic nephrectomy, ureterectomy on [**2159-5-7**] Hx of UTI's - [**2159-3-9**] grew coagulase negative staph in [**5-14**] bottles, Staph epidermitis was cultured from  his urine Hypospadias Urethral stricture disease s/p dilation [**2159-4-17**] Bilateral ureteral reflux Inguinal hernia Hydrocele [**11-8**]: scrotal hernia repair [**2142**]: urethral blockage release VRE  Social History: Patient is single.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %).
Estimated EF at time of chest closure is 40%.
The left ventricular wall thickness appears much greater now that the chamber size has decreased.
Wall thicknesses measure approximately 1.6cm, representing moderate concentric hypertrophy.

His pressors and inotropes were d/c'd and on post-op day one he was started on beta blocker and diuretics and received Coumadin for prosthetic AVR.
He continued to have no improvement with his rhythm and on [**7-9**] a permanent pacemaker was placed.
Coumadin was restarted and titrated for goal INR for mechanical aortic valve of 2.5-3.
His INR was therapeutic and will be followed by his PCP.
