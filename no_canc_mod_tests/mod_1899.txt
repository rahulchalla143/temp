CXR ([**2106-4-16**]) - Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.
Echo ([**2106-4-12**]) - The left and right atria are moderately dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-3-24**], right ventricular cavity enlargement and free wall hypokinesis are now seen.
CT Head ([**2106-4-12**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
MRI Head ([**2106-4-13**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 y/o M ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%, now s/p VT/VF arrest transferred with cardiogenic shock.
The patient quickly had his pressors weaned to off and he remained hemodynamicaly stable.
While the patient did have a positive troponin, his CK's were negative.
# Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15%.
Echo was performed and showed severely dilated LV with apical aneurysm and severe global hypokinesis and new dilation with free wall hypokinesis in the RV (see above for full report).
# LV Thrombus: The patient has a history of LV thrombus, for which he is on coumadin.
On INR was initially supratherapeutic on presenation, and his coumadin was help.
CT head did not show any acute process.
MRI head showed findings consistent with microangiopathic small vessel disease and alchoholism (see above for complete report).
However, they recommended outpatient evaluation by cognitive neurology if he did not continue to improve.
Creatinine was improving at the time of d/c.
