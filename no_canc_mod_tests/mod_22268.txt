A cardiac echo done at the outside hospital revealed mildly dilated left ventricle with normal wall thickness, severe diffuse hypokinesis, ejection fraction 30%.
The valve is bicuspid, calcified and severely stenotic, with a mean gradient of 44 mmHg, with a peak gradient of 79 mmHg, and calculated valve area of 0.5 cm2.
There was 1+ mitral valve regurgitation and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated pulmonary arterial pressure of 51 mmHg.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  The patient was afebrile, heart rate 66, in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 104/68.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal exam - soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly noted.
The patient had 2+ carotid, femoral and dorsalis pedis pulses noted.
EKG showed the patient had normal sinus rhythm with a QRS interval of 0.1.
LABS ON ADMISSION:  CBC - white blood cells 7.2, hematocrit 41.6, platelets 214.
Chemistry - sodium 137, potassium 4.4, chloride 101, bicarb 30, BUN 19, creatinine 0.8, glucose 132, ALT 24, AST 20, digoxin level 0.9, GT 13.6, INR 1.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for a cardiac catheterization on [**2148-12-13**].
Left circumflex:  80% stenosis at the proximal small intermedius, 90% proximal large OM1, occluded mid left circumflex.
It was determined that the patient needed to undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram to evaluate the questionable mass seen on the echo from the outside hospital.
Nitroglycerin was weaned to keep his systolic blood pressure from 105-120.
The patient was given 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 25.9.
The patient's chest tube drained a moderate amount of sanguineous and serosanguineous fluid, no air leak or crepitus were noted.
The patient remained on an insulin drip which maintained his blood glucose within excellent limits.
On postoperative day #2, the patient continued to do well, was weaned down to 2 liters nasal cannula, with his oxygen saturation remaining over 96%.
