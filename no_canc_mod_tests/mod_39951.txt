Cultures at that time grew gram-positive cocci.
A swab was taken at that time which grew gram-negative rods, which turned out to be Klebsiella that was sensitive to levofloxacin.
Of note, the patient's rapamycin level was also decreased from 2 mg a day to 1 mg a day.
Patient, hence, did not report any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 96.5, blood pressure 170/90, pulse 58, respiratory rate 16, O2 saturation 99% on room air.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no rales or rhonchi.
LABORATORIES ON [**8-19**]:  Patient has a wound culture that grew Klebsiella sensitive to levofloxacin.
White count of 12.8 with no left shift.
Sodium 141, potassium 5.2, bicarb of 11, BUN of 51, creatinine is 7.2, glucose of 189.
Patient has an albumin of 3.7, calcium 9.1, and a phosphorus of 5.9.
Rapamycin level of 3.4.
Blood cultures were drawn and ID was consulted.
Repeat cultures eventually grew back just gram-negative rods and so patient was continued on levofloxacin.
On [**8-29**], the patient went to the OR and debridement was done with intraoperative tissue and bone cultures sent.
Tissue and bone cultures grew out gram-positive cocci, coag-negative gram-positive cocci, and gram-negative rods not Pseudomonas.
The patient was then started on IV Vancomycin 1 gram dose for levels less than 15.
Patient's renal function, BUN and creatinine remained stable throughout the hospitalization.
Hyperphosphatemia:  On admission, patient had a phosphate of 5.9.
Hypocalcemia:  Patient's calcium level on admission was within normal limits.
Acidosis:  On admission, patient had a bicarb level of 11.
Hyperkalemia:  Throughout the hospitalization, patient required multiple doses of Kayexalate to maintain his potassium less than 5.
