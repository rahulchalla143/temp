Radiology XR CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2165-11-24**] 10:31 AM FINDINGS: The lungs are clear.
XR CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2165-11-24**] 12:16 PM FINDINGS: Compared to the study two hours prior, there has been no interval change.
The cardiac silhouette, hilar, and mediastinal contours appear normal.
MRA CHEST W&W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2165-11-24**] 7:33 PM FINDINGS: The aorta and great vessels demonstrate normal caliber and contour throughout.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reconstructions and subtraction images provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series (series 308-309).
D-dimer was negative and had MRA chest which showed no dissection or PE.
She has had multiple previous episodes of various pains with multiple repeated CTAs and CT of the abdomen which have been negative.
Original CTA in [**2158**] showed small PE in a RUL segmental branch.
Dyspnea: possibly related to asthma, she has a history of childhood asthma and multiple allergies, in addition she has had normal spirometry but no methacholine challange so it is possible her asthma is simply not severe enough to lead to abnormal PFTs which have been performed when the patient is feeling well.
Chest Pain: ruled out for MI, no PE or dissection.
