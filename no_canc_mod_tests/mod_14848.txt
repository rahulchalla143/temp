On Nsurg, he received a total of 30mg vitamin K and 5 units of FFP to reverse his INR (he is on warfarin for afib).
His INR has remained elevated but his bleed is small and his neurologic exam is intact.
There was concern for a PE so he was sent to CTA chest yesterday.
GERD 5. sleep apnea, noncompliant with CPAP 6. pseudotumor cerebri 7. recent cardiac ablation  Social History: Married, works as a contractor.
On transfer to the MICU: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: CT HEAD [**1-21**]: 1.
Limited study due to motion.
- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-1-21**] 2:29 AM FINDINGS: Examination is degraded by motion artifact, which persisted despite repeating the examination.
Limited study due to motion.
- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-1-21**] 9:48 AM Again noted is  small acute subdural hematoma in the bilateral inferior frontal egions along the gyri recti or straight gyrus, extending superiorly up the anterior falx.
- CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2129-1-21**] 2:29 PM There is no pulmonary embolism.
Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is likely reactive, but if clinically warranted, a followup chest CT could be performed in three to six months to determine resolution.
CT head non con [**1-23**]: 1.
CT abd/pelvis: 1.
An underlying mass is not visualized, however further characterization is limited by lack of IV contrast.
MRI head/MRA: 1.
MRI abd/pelvis: 1.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-1-27**], the pericardial effusion is smaller.
# Altered Mental status: Patient had extensive imaging (CT/MRI), blood/urine/sputum cultures, EEG and a lumbar puncture, all of which were unrevealing.
Patient was initially withdrawing from alcohol, then it was unclear if his intracranial hemorrhages and initial head trauma had caused residual damage.
- Please note that patient does have a tendency to wax and wane, and still has evidence of frontal brain contusion on imaging - Continue to work with Physical and Occupational therapy as much as posible - Maintain sleep/wake cycle, manage symptoms (pain), re-orient frequently and encourage family at bedside .
Patient was restarted on Coumadin on day of discharge - Continue heparin gtt (currently 3000 units/hour) with lower goal PTT 60-80 in setting of his intracranial hemorrhages - Continue Coumadin at 4mg daily.
It is important that patient get close (daily) PTT/INR checks as his goal INR should be lower, close to 2.0, in the setting of his head bleeds.
Serial EKG's showed borderline first degree AV block, which per his outpatient cardiologist, is what he exhibits when not in atrial fibrillation.
Maximum sinus rhythm intervals has been a few weeks each time.
Given his admission for cerebral contusion and multiple intracranial hemorrhages, his coumadin was initially stopped and his INR reversed with FFP and vitamin K. Patient's most recent ablation had been at [**Hospital6 1708**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2129-1-15**] (ph: [**0-0-**]).
Patient's heart rate and blood pressures were relatively well controlled on Labetalol.
Repeat ECHOs showed unchanged cardiac function and minimal pericardial effusion.
- Continue Labetalol 800mg PO TID - Given stability of creatinine, can add Lisinopril if blood pressures are not well controlled - Continue to control gout pain with tylenol as needed .
# Acute Renal Insufficiency: Patient's creatinine bumped up to 3.3, etiology likely multifactorial (drug induced, pre-renal, etc).
By time of discharge, patient's creatinine had stabilized to 1.5-1.7, which is felt likely to be his new baseline.
He also needs an audiogram in 1 week.
He underwent serial CT scans for worsening intracranial bleeds or new fractures, which were both negative.
Ultimately, patient's mental status improved dramatically and final CT scan on [**2-8**] showed continued signs of frontal brain contusion from his fall but no acute processes.
You also developed symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, which was also managed by close monitoring and medications.
You developed gout in your left albow and a deep vein thrombosis in your right leg which are being treated with steroids and blood thinners, respectively.
Of note, --> STOP your home Sotalol, continue Labetalol 800mg three times daily for now --> START Coumadin 4mg daily with close INR monitoring (goal 2.0) .
Dr. [**Name (NI) 51659**] office number: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 45578**] * Please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 88**] to schedule an appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], to be seen in 4 weeks * You need to see ENT, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2349**] in [**1-1**] weeks.
You need to have an audiogram in 1 wk.
