Cardiac Cath [**1-11**]: PTCA COMMENTS: The patient was emergently brought to the catheterization lab after undergoing cardiac arrest thrice at an outlying hospital and again en route to our facility.
Initial angiogram demonstrated proximal total occlusion of the proximal LAD.
Prior to proceeding with intervention a 40cc IABP was placed for hemodynamic support for during and post  procedure afterload reduction and diastolic augmentation via standard technique through the righ common femoral artery.
Integrelin was the anticoagulant used during the procedure.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis and no angiographic evidence of dissection, thrombus or perforation with TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.
The final angiogram demonstrated no residual stenosis with no angiographic  evidence of dissection, embolization or perforation with TIMI III flow in the distal vessel with grade 2 blush.
Cardiogenic shock s/p cardiac arrest 2.
ECHO [**1-11**] - Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic  dysfunction with near akinesis of all segments except for the basal half of the inferior and inferiolateral walls which are hypokinetic.
ECHO [**1-13**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Cardiac Cath [**1-15**]: 1.
ECHO [**1-15**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis of the septum, anterior wall and apex.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-1-13**], the overall LVEF is lower.
Echo [**1-18**]: MEASUREMENTS: EF 20% (nl >=55%) LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-1-15**], there is no significant change.
Combined with mild hypodensity on corresponding CT in these regions, the findings suggest subacute infarction.
CT Chest w/o contrast [**1-30**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: Soft tissue window images demonstrate several prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 11 mm in short axis diameter in the right peritracheal region (series 3, image 9) and a second prominent, but nonenlarged 8 mm lymph node (series 3, image 17).
The prominent pretracheal lymph node (series 3, image 18) contains fat, and is likely benign.
Lung window images demonstrate scattered areas of ground-glass opacity bilaterally, and areas of interlobular septal thickening at the lung bases independently.
On the limited images of the superior portion of the abdomen, the patient is status post cholecystectomy.
Further evaluation with an US or MRI is recommended.
On HD#3, pt transferred to cath lab emergently for ST elevations in anterior leads, found to have in-stent thrombosis, thrombectomy and PTCA performed, IABP replaced, heparin initiated, plavix loaded at 300mg, began 150mg qd.
PUMP - patient found to have EF of 20% with anteroseptal/anterior/apical akinesis, was aggressively diuresed on 40 IV lasix and will be d/c on Lasix 20 PO along with spiranolactone.
He should also be evaluated in [**5-14**] weeks for SCD stratification with an echo, or alternatively, a signal averaged EKG and cardiac MRI.
Due to some blood tinged sputum two weeks into his hospital stay and abnormal findings on his chest  xray, a pulmonary consult was placed, with the recommendations to defer on bronchoscopy and following clinically.
# GI: On hosptial day 1, patient had coffee ground emesis on nasogastric suctioning, which prompted holding patient's heparin administration.
His hematocrit remained stable upon discharge on 30-35.
Patient's panculture initially returned negative, save diptheroids on a blood culture.
Followup Instructions: ECHO in 4 weeks - [**2162-3-8**] 2pm in [**Location (un) 8661**] [**Location (un) 436**].
You will need signal averaged EKG and cardiac MRI to be performed as an outpatient.
You will also have an outpatient echo performed on [**2162-3-8**] at 2:00 pm prior to this appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
