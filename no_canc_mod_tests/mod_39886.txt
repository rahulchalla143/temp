Admission Date:  [**2137-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-4-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-10-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Hydromorphone / Amoxicillin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea, tachypnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: 78 M w/ ESRD on HD MWF, CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-->LAD, SVG-->OM1 and OM2) and St. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 1525**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1291**] ([**12-12**]), sCHF w/ LVEF 30%, admitted from [**Hospital 100**] rehab today for sudden onset dyspnea, which began upon awakening this AM at 0900.
He was noted to have gained weight despite HD yesterday as he was 149 lbs on [**4-6**] and 159 lbs on [**4-8**] and [**4-9**].
At rehab, he was given 5u insulin for FSBS 500, 2mg morphine and 40mg IV lasix for volume overload, although patient is anuric at baseline and has ESRD requiring HD 3x/ wk.
There he was noted to have a Troponin of 0.47, which is around his baseline and BNP of >70,000 and appeared volume overloaded on exam.
VS prior to transfer: 97 101/73 35 99% 2L NC .
CXR was c/w volume overload although underlying RLL PNA could not be excluded, so he was given IV vancomycin and was written for levofloxacin and clindamycin.
Past Medical History: --chronic sCHF(EF 30%) --ESRD on HD --Chronic L-pleural effusion --Prior GI bleed - ?rectal ulcer --HLD --IDDM --chronic AF on coumadin --CVA with no residual neurologic deficits --Hypothyroidism --AS s/p [**Month/Day (2) 1291**] [**Hospital3 **] --Hyperparathyroidism --R-AVF --Rectal Ulcers: CMV positive --BCx during his prior hospitalization grew Aeromonas hydrophilia which was treated with 6wks cipro, last day [**2137-2-5**].
During this time he developed LGIB, colonscopy revealed rectal uclers which were cauterizated and biospy was CMV positive.

ECHO [**2137-4-16**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-3-4**], left ventricular systolic function now appears more vigorous, alhtough view are suboptimal for comparison.
[**4-17**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**4-16**], there is probably little change given the semierect rather than supine position.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 M w/ ESRD on HD (MWF), CAD s/p CABG and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) 1525**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1291**], systolic CHF (EF=30%), and AF on Coumadin, presents from [**Hospital1 10151**] with acute onset dyspnea and respiratory distress, likely in the setting of volume overload.
# DYSPNEA: Most likely secondary to volume overload given [**Hospital1 **] exam, BNP >70,000, known systolic CHF, and CXR findings.
PO flagyl switched to IV formulation, and stool sent for C. diff which was negative.
Patient was also started on empiric antibiotics for treatment of possible PNA or bacteremia given history and dyspnea on presentation, and blood cultures sent.
Stool sent for C. diff which was negative.
Dressing C/D/I, and wound appeared well-healed w/ granulation tissue and scant serous drainage on bandage.
