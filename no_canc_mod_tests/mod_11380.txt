He was found to have elevated liver function tests with a total bilirubin of 7.5, ALT of 105, AST of 106, and alkaline phosphatase of 325.
His hematocrit was 24%.
His platelet count was less than 10.
His sodium was 127.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further workup.
Meningitis 12 years prior to admission.
A biopsy in [**2134-9-8**] demonstrated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.
A subsequent biopsy in [**2135-2-8**] demonstrated chronic inflammation only.
FAMILY HISTORY:   There is no family history of blood dyscrasias.
Temperature was 98.4, blood pressure was 108/70, heart rate was 108, respiratory rate was 20, oxygen saturation was 99% on 2.5 liters of oxygen.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The reflexes were 1+ throughout.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Data revealed white blood cell count was 12.2 (with 15% neutrophils, 7% bands, 64% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, 10% atypical lymphocytes, 1% metamyelocytes), hematocrit was 18%, platelet count was 9.
PT was 13.5, PTT was 31.8, D-dimer was 1000 to [**2133**].
Sodium was 132, potassium was 4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 16, creatinine was 0.8, blood glucose was 175.
ALT was 85, AST was 89, LDH was 885, alkaline phosphatase was 306, total bilirubin was 6, direct bilirubin was 3.9, indirect bilirubin was 2.1.
Calcium was 7, magnesium was 2, phosphate was 3.7. uric acid was 5.7.
A blood smear demonstrated microspherocytes, larger basophilic stippled cells, anisocytosis with minimal poikilocytosis.
Given the extent of hemodynamic monitoring that would have been required initially, he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
The bone marrow biopsy demonstrated a markedly hypercellular marrow for his age group with lymphoplasmacytic hyperplasia with scattered large immunoblasts.
He underwent a thorough workup by the blood bank.
His blood demonstrated evidence of both cold and warm autoantibodies.
He received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cell blood transfusion and 4 units of platelets blood transfusion.
Due to the likelihood of autoimmune warm hemolytic anemia, autoimmune cold hemolytic anemia, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia he was started on stress-dose steroids.
After reaching a nadir of 6000, the platelet count was 92,000 at the time of discharge.
His hematocrit did show some response to blood cell transfusions and corticosteroids.
He underwent radiologic screening to evaluate for evidence of leukemia or lymphoma.
A liver and gallbladder ultrasound demonstrated evidence of a simple hepatic cyst with no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
A CT of the torso demonstrated bilateral extensive cervical, axillary, anterior mediastinal, and precordial lymphadenopathy of which the largest lymph nodes were in the left axilla.
A CT of the neck to evaluate his cervical lymph nodes demonstrated abnormal parotid glands which were slightly enlarged within an irregular cystic pattern, question representative of Mikulicz syndrome.
It should be noted that he had been started on intravenous corticosteroids prior to the CT scan of the neck and torso and that his palpable lymph nodes had shrunk dramatically by the time that the radiographic studies had been done.
He underwent an excisional biopsy of a right axillary lymph node.
RHEUMATOLOGY:  He had a Rheumatology evaluation for the possibility that these symptoms were all related to a rheumatologic disorder.
A rheumatologic series of tests were ordered to further determine the possible nature of his symptoms.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was initially 100 but had decreased to 17 by the week after discharge.
His absolute CD4 count was greater than 2500.
His serum viscosity was 1.8 which was at the upper limit of normal.
Antinuclear antibody was positive as a titer of 1:320 in a speckled pattern.
A SPEP demonstrated evidence of a polyclonal hypogammaglobinemia with no evidence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin.
Human immunodeficiency virus antibody test was negative.
Hepatitis C antibody was negative.
A UPEP demonstrated some albumin, but no evidence of a Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] protein.
A Monospot test for acute [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus infection was negative.
A test for cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G antibody was negative.
Cultures of the right axillary lymph node were negative for evidence of aerobic bacterial infection, anaerobic bacterial infection, or mycobacterial, or fungal infection.
A further test for [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus early antigen was positive at 1.47 (negative is less than 0.9 with equivocal being 0.91 to 1.09).
A test for beta-2 microglobulin was abnormal at 5.7 (normal 0.7 to 1.8).
They recommended many of the viral and bacterial tests detailed in the section entitled Rheumatology.
At the time of discharge, there was no obvious infectious etiology for his presenting signs and symptoms.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  He was to follow up as an outpatient two days after discharge for repeat hematocrit and platelet count.
