In addition in the Emergency Department, she also received charcoal, 6 mg Ativan, and 4 mg Versed prior to her CT scan as the patient was very agitated.
A chest x-ray was done which showed no underlying pulmonary disease, and a CT of the head was a limited study due to constant patient movement but no intracranial disease was identified.
She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for her intubation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and her ventilatory settings were in the SIMV mode with a tidal volume of 550 times 12 breaths, pressure support of 10, PEEP 5, FIO2 40% and Ativan drip of 2 mg per hour.
After discussion with toxicology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that since the patient already received 50 grams of charcoal in the Emergency Department, it would be safe to extubate her and the patient probably did not have significant PCA toxicity as her QRS complexes were not widened.
She was extubated without difficulty and she maintained good oxygen saturation at above 90%.
Electrocardiogram was still unchanged with same prolonged Q-T.  She was cleared for the Intensive Care Unit and it was initially decided that she was either going to go to the psychiatry or to the medical floor pending psychiatry recommendations.
