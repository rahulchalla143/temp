Pt states sx started worsening [**Holiday **] Eve, with 7-8 minutes of [**10-28**] chest pain, which went away on its own.
He was given SL nitro x1 and ASA 162 with relief of pain.
At OSH, EKG showed V1-V3 STE with ST depressions inferiorly, and troponin I was positive at 0.98.

EKG at OSH: STE in V1-V3 1.5 mm, <1mm ST depressions II, III, AVF.
EKG in ED: STE in V1-V3 <1mm.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be  excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed  (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the  midventricular and apical segments of the anterior septum and anterior free wall; the rest of the left ventricle is normal or hyperdynamic.
Tissue Doppler  imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).

His CKs peaked at 319.
He will need a CBC checked Q 2 wks x 3mo, then q 6 mo x 1yr, then yearly to look for Ticlid toxicity.
An echo done on [**1-13**] showed EF of 40-45 % with nl LA/RA, mild LVH, and hypokinesis of midventricular, apical, anterior free wall and apical septum.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus could not be excluded.
He was discharged on coumadin with lovenox [**Hospital1 **] to be taken until his INR is therapuetic.
VNA was scheduled to check his INR two and four days after discharge.
Hyperlipidemia: The patients cholesterol panel was checked: LDL 108 HDL 33.
