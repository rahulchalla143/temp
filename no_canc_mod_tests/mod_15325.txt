Her ventilator settings at that time were assist control with a tidal volume of 600, a respiratory rate of 12, an FIO2 of 0.5, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 6.
This resulted in an arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.12, a carbonate dioxide of 104, and an O2 of 36.
She had an urgent bronchoscopy, as the original thought was that perhaps her stents had been displaced causing blockage and hypoxia.
The bronchoscopy showed that her stents were in place.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97.1 degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 106/43 (on a Levophed drip), her heart rate was 92, her respiratory rate was 17, and her oxygen saturation was 100% on assist control with a tidal volume of 450, respiratory rate 18, FIO2 of 0.7, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
Her neck was a difficult examination as the tracheostomy collar was in place.
Lungs prior to the urgent bronchoscopy revealed decreased air movement on the right with minimal breath sounds on the left.
Extremity examination revealed extremities which were cool distally with dopplerable distal pulses.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial laboratories revealed her white blood cell count was 6.5, her hematocrit was 31.7, and her platelets were 298.
Sodium was 143, potassium was 4.7, chloride was 107, bicarbonate was 31, blood urea nitrogen was 37, creatinine was 0.9, and her blood glucose was 194.
Her liver function tests were normal with an alkaline phosphatase of 150 and a total bilirubin of 0.2.
Her albumin was 2.4.
Her calcium was 7.4, her phosphate was 5.5, and her magnesium was 2.3.
Creatine kinase was 27.
Her troponin was pending.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed hyperinflation on the right with left main stem with discrete cutoff prior to the bronchoscopy.
An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes.
Two days prior to discharge, the patient was on assist control with a tidal volume of 550, respiratory rate of 15, with two spontaneous breaths per minute, an FIO2 of 50%, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 8.
Her oxygen saturations were in the mid 90s, and her arterial blood gas levels were appropriate.
Subsequently, sputum cultures grew out Klebsiella and Serratia which were sensitive to ceftriaxone.
The patient was continued on linezolid, and blood cultures were taken which were negative.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection fraction of 25% to 30% with 3+ mitral regurgitation and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
With treatment of her pneumonia with antibiotics as well as initiation of digoxin, she has been able to maintain her blood pressures adequately without the need for pressors.
A cortical stimulation test was performed which was difficult to interpret due to her baseline levels of prednisone.
She received fludrocortisone by mouth and hydrocortisone intravenously, which was discontinued on the day prior to discharge.
She had her electrolytes repleted as needed.
SEDATION ISSUES:  The patient remained on a Versed drip and Fentanyl drip during her time here, which were weaned approximately 20% per day toward her discharge.
At times the patient was very agitated during examination but was able to be calmed with verbal preparation.
