Lungs are low in volume, but caliber of the pulmonary vasculature and cardiac silhouette is probably normal.
MRI Head (preliminary read):  No acute intracranial abnormality.
Renal Ultrasound: The right kidney measures 12.1 cm, the left kidney measures 10.6 cm without evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or masses.
CT sinus/mandible: FINDINGS: There is anterior dislocation of the right mandibular condyle and anterior subluxation of the left mandibular condyle, which appears partially reduced compared to yesterday's outside hospital head CT.
Air-fluid levels and mucosal thickening are seen in the sphenoid sinuses bilaterally.
This study is not optimized for evaluation of intracranial structures; within this limitation, no large abnormalities are detected.

Preliminary read of the EEG shows generalized slowing while on propofol drip.
Brain MRI was done which showed no structural abnormality of the brain to explain seizures.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Patient admitted with serum creatinine 1.4 which increased to 3.1.
CK was elevated in the 5000s was noted to be down trending on day of discharge.
Patient made good urine output in the latter part of the admission.
Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.
Follow-up regarding serum creatinine will need to be done on an outpatient basis.
By day of discharge, patient's serum creatinine had trended down to 2.5.
Records of the patient's hematocrit/hemoglobin were unable to be obtained during the admission.
Iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
Retic count is depressed with suggestive a myelosuppressive state, though the patient is not currently on medications that would cause a myelosuppressive state.
Likely secondary to seizures, but differential also includes infectious etiology such as pneumonia (given possible RUL infiltrate on CXR with poor inspiration).
WBC trended down on day of admission.
Urine culture was negative.
Final blood cultures were still pending on day of discharge.
There is no fracture see on CT of the mandible.
Troponins were negative times three during this admission, so no further action was taken, especially in absence of chest pain.
- Follow-up with primary care physician on [**2145-11-29**] regarding recent hospitalization and follow-up of patient's chemistry panel with serum creatinine to ensure that serum creatinine continues to trend down.
- Follow-up of pending blood cultures  Medications on Admission: ASA 81mg Insulin 70/30 20 units [**Hospital1 **] Vitamin B12 500mg daily Calcium plus Vitamin D   Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO DAILY (Daily).

5. insulin NPH & regular human 100 unit/mL (70-30) Suspension Sig: Twenty (20) units Subcutaneous at dinner daily.
An MRI of your head was done to determine if there was a brain abnormality that was causing your seizures, but no abnormality was identified.
