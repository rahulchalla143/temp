In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.0 HR 220 BP 142/117 RR 24 O2 97% RA.
He was found to be in afib with RVR on arrival with stable blood pressures and otherwise asymptomatic.
He had a CXR which showed a ?RLL PNA which was difficult to visualize.
He then began to be more tachypneic with RR in the 30s and oxygen sats dropped requiring a non-breather.
Due to concerns for PE he underwent CTA which showed no PE.
After the CT scan, he was more tachypneic with RR in the 40s and O2 sats 95% on NRB.
BNP was elevated 10,245.
A repeat CXR showed a RLL infiltrate after 2L NS.

CTA chest [**2166-5-22**]: CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
The adrenal glands appear diffusely thickened bilaterally; only imaged on the non-contrast images (2:61, 2:60).
Scattered sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules, for which followup 12-month chest CT may be indicated if there is high risk for primary or secondary lung malignancy.
Consider adrenal protocol CT or MR for further evaluation if indicated.
CXR [**2166-5-22**]: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lung volumes are again diminished, and a previously subtle opacity in the right lung base has dramatically increased in the short interval.
Echocardiogram [**2166-5-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CXR [**2166-5-23**]: Compared to the prior study, there is significant improvement in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe opacities most likely consistent with interval resolution of pulmonary edema versus aspiration.
The rhthym was felt initally to be most consistent with atrial fibrillation, although there were episodes where the heart rate were regular, and it is uncommon for A-fib to reach rate in 200s.
TSH was normal at 2.3.
BNP was elevated in support of volume overload in the lungs.

([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2261**]) on Monday ([**5-26**]) to establish follow up for the following week.
You will need to have your INR (level of anticoagulation) monitored closely because you were started on Warfarin (an anticoagulant) while you were hospitalized.
