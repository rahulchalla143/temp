The patient was defibrillated multiple times, intubated, with electrocardiogram showing anterior ST elevation.
The patient got a balloon pump for a systolic blood pressure in the 80s and catheterization values showed an elevated wedge pressure of 31, PA sat of 42%, cardiac index of 1.58 and a cardiac output of 2.48.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs temperature 97.6.
Blood pressures 130s/70s.
The patient was ventilated on AC at a tidal volume of 550 with 12 breaths per minute at 100% FIO2 and a PEEP of 5.
HEENT examination was significant for pin point pupils.
Cardiovascular examination showed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, gallops or rubs were heard.
Extremities showed trace pretibial edema, 2+ femoral pulses bilaterally, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and no femoral bruits.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  CPK of 264 with a troponin I of 3.25.
CBC with a white blood cell count of 11.9, hemoglobin 11.6 and hematocrit of 33.3 and platelets of 403.
Chem 7 showed a sodium of 129, potassium 3.9, chloride of 94 and a bicarb of 25 with a BUN of 23 and a creatinine of 1.0, glucose 110, calcium 9.3, magnesium 2.0, phosphate 3.1.
The INR was .92, albumin 3.8.
The electrocardiogram showed tachycardia at a rate of 142 with a normal axis and normal intervals.
ST elevations were 3 to 5 mm in V2 through V4 and there were Q waves in V1 through V3 with ST depressions of 1 mm in the inferior leads.
Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema in the bilateral upper lungs without effusions.
An arterial blood gas initially showed a pH of 7.28 with a carbon dioxide of 46 and a PO2 of 71 on 550 tidal volume, 100% FIO2 and a PEEP of 5.
Late during day one on admission the patient went into complete heart block with ventricular response in the 40s and a blood pressure drop from 130 systolic to 90 systolic.
The left anterior descending artery, which had been stented in the previous catheterization was still patent and the left main coronary artery showed a 30% lesion, which was not intervened.
However, further workup of CAT scan and repeat echocardiogram will be pursued if deemed necessary.
