Cardiovascular - The patient presented with hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 60s, likely secondary to a calcium channel blocker overdose, taking twice the dose that he usually takes at home.
During this hospital course, the patient's blood pressure improved and he was restarted on Verapamil sustained release 120 mg p.o.
He will have his creatinine followed up with his outpatient primary care physician.
Repeat electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a narrow complex and normal intervals.
On admission, the patient ruled out for myocardial ischemia by negative cardiac enzymes times three.
Given his previous history of myocardial infarction in the setting of demand ischemia, and as the patient has a baseline tachycardia, he was again placed on telemetry which did not show any events and again ruled out for ischemia by negative cardiac enzymes times three.
