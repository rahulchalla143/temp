CT C-Spine ([**8-13**]) FINDINGS: There is no fracture.
While this finding may be degenerative in etiology, an MRI is recommended for evaluation of ligamentous and spinal cord injury.
ERCP ([**8-13**]) - Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
The course and caliber of the structures are normal with no evidence of extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities, and no filling defects A balloon sweep was performed which did not show any blood or stones.
He underwent repeat ERCP but no active bleeding was seen from the sphincterotomy site.
Formal upper endoscopy not performed during this exam but no gross blood was noted in the stomach.
Hematocrit was followed in the ICU and on the medical floor; HCT remained stable and he was treated conservatively.
