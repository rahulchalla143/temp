The ventricles, cisterns, and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation are unremarkable.
Echo Conclusions: 1.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.

Subsequent cath showed a right dominant system, with 60%LAD, clean LCx and a RCA with 70% ulcerated proximal lesion that was fixed with a DES.
V-gram showed a LVEF 45% with inferior akinesis consistent with a RV inferior MI.
CE's were followed and a peak CK 2418/MB>500/Tt14.3 on initial draw that consistently trended down.
Both the beta-blocker and ACEi will need to be titrated as an outpatient to acheive the best control of HR and BP possible.
Pre-cath echo showed a depressed LV systolic function but was unable to asses more thoroughly; intra-cath V-gram showed a LVEF 45% with inf.
ECG on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] showed NSR with presumably new RBBB.
After catherization, Pt consistently tachycardiac with HR in 100's.
Pt [**Name (NI) 6060**] and BP stable.
Most likely will need continued up titration of lopressor as tolerated and then conversion to once a day atenolol or Toprol XL.
4) Head Hematoma: Normal neurologic exam but given recent thrombolytics, a head Ct was obtained which was negative for acute bleed or mass effect.
Pt was maintained on [**Hospital1 **] dosing of 1 mg ativan anc covered by CIWA scale which was not necessary.
please call or PCP or return to the ED if experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, fever >101.4, fainting, heart palpitations, inability to tolerate food or liquid, persistent nausea or vomitting.
