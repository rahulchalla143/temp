Vitals on arrival 94/52, 83, 14, 98 F. Given her altered mental status, CT head was performed with preliminary read raising the question of a basal ganglia hemorrhage.
Labs there revealed AST 103 / ALT 112, Ap 451, T bili 3.0 and D bili 2.1.
Patient underwent repeat head CT which did not reveal any acute intracraneal process.
Labs repeated and given OSH elevation in liver enzymes and congestive pattern, CT abdomen was performed.
Surgery, GI and ERCP services were [**Name (NI) 653**], and decision was made to admit patient to ICU for further management.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
Final internal length is 36 cm with the tip positioned in the SVC.
# MRSA Sepsis - Patient was initially admitted to the ICU with GI bleed and was quickly transitioned to the floor once her Hct was stable.
A Left IJ was placed and her Right IJ, which was placed in the ED for access due to GIB, was pulled.
Blood cultures grew out 4/4 bottles of MRSA (presumed from initial CVL) with GNR in [**11-25**] bottles.
A TTE showed mildly thickened mitral valve, but no evidence of valvular vegitation.
Her surveillance blood cultures remained negative at the time of discharge.
Her white count was trending down throught the day of discharge.
She was discharged with heart rate in the 70's on 12.5mg twice daily of Metoprolol, which may titrated up if needed.
In the ICU she underwent an EGD which revealed esophageal candidiasis.
She had possible proctitis on CT scan and treated with cipro flagyl.
She expressed a desire to limit invasive testing and due to the fact that she had a recent (2 years ago) colonoscopy which did not show any masses, it was felt that colonoscopy could be deferred at this time.
Her HCT remained stable throughout the remainder of the admission.
On [**2132-5-6**] she received one unit of pRBC's for a HCT of 22.7 for symptommatic relief.
It recommended for her to have weekly CBC checked for HCT monitoring.
Her steriods were transiently increased to stress doses in the ICU for possible adrenal insufficiency in the face of long standing steriod use, but once septic picture presented itself, prednisone was restarted at 5mg [**Hospital1 **].
It should be noted that she is incontinent, making monitoring of urine output difficult.
