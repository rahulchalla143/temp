Urinalysis showed 15 ketones and serum aspirin level was within normal limits at 72.
CBC, coagulation studies, urine toxicology (including benzodiazepines, cocaine, amphetamines, cannabinoids, opiates, and barbiturates), serum toxicology (including acetaminophen and alcohol), CT head and neck, and chest x-ray were all reportedly unremarkable.

Limited examination at this time is notable for possible for rigidity and abnormal movements that may represent generalized tonic-clonic activity versus decerebrate posturing.
Initial laboratory studies are notable only for an elevated lactate, which may be secondary to ictal activity or hypotension, and hypocalcemia.
EKG shows right bundle branch block.
Head CT shows an old posterior right temporal hypodensity, likely encephalomalacia from her prior contusion.
Neuro -LP showed protein 57, glucose 101, WBC 1, 100% lymph, RBC 5, gram stain showed no microorganisms, bacterial culture showed no growth, f/u HSV PCR and Lyme -Discontinued Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Acyclovir given LP results -CT Head showed no acute intracranial process, stable encephalomalacia in the right temporal lobe.
-MRI/MRA of the head showed right temporal encephalomalacia and small areas of encephalomalacia in the subcortical white matter of right frontal and parietal lobes which have evolved since the previous MRI of [**2171-7-2**], no acute infarct seen, mass effect, or hydrocephalus identified, somewhat artifact-limited normal MRA of the head -EEG showed slow background and occasional suppressive bursts.
-Keppra increased from 1500 mg PO bid to 2000mg [**Hospital1 **], weaned off Dilantin -Ativan IV prn seizure cluster -urine tox positive for benzos, serum tox ASA 6 -CT C-spine showed no acute fracture or malalignment, multilevel degenerative changes, C-collar removed  2.
ID - blood cultures negative -CXR showed no consolidation -UA showed 50 ketones, neg leuk/nitr, f/u urine culture -CSF culture showed no growth -Lactate 2.9->0.9 - HSV CSF pending at d/c - Afebrile while on floor  5.
FEN/GI -Prelim read of CT abd/pelvis showed early SBO, attending read showed marked distention of the distal duodenum and jejunum with thickening of the mucosal wall concerning for ischemia, though could represnet shock bowel.
There is no evidence for small bowel obstruction and distal loops of small and large bowel are normal in appearance.
-She also had coffee grounds emesis out of NG tube, Surgery consulted: no evidence of obstruction upon attending review but finding c/w hypotensive ischemia -LFTs, lipase normal -f/u stool guaiac -Regular diet -IVF standing -Cont.
