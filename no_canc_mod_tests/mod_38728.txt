She had mild resting tachycardia to 110bpm, sPO2 97% on room air, and BPs were 90-100s/60-70s.
Her EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with low voltage and RAD with S1T3 pattern and diffuse T wave abnormalities anteriorly.
Cardiac echocardiogram revealed mild dilation of right atria and ventricle, abnormal RV septal motion, mild PA systolic hypertension, and a normal ejection fraction (>55%).
Her sats improved to 99-100% on room air and she had a normal heartrate (80s).
Of note, antiphospholipid and anticardiolipin antibodies were pending at the time of discharge.
*) FWB: Fetal testing was reassuring during this admission.
Ultrasound on [**10-31**] reavealed a breech fetus, normal anatomy, normal fluid, and EFW 725g(49%).
Given her gestational age, she was monitored with fetal heartrate checks only.
