1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were obtained without spectral fat saturation pre-pulses in 5 mm contiguous slices.
2) Function: Breath-hold cine SSFP images were acquired in the left ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis, short axis slices (8 mm slices with 2 mm gaps), sagittal and coronal orientations of the left ventricular outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations.
3) Flow: Phase-contrast cine images were obtained transverse to the aorta (axial plane) and main pulmonary artery (oblique plane).
4) Coronary MRI ([**Last Name (NamePattern1) 75514**] screen): Free-breathing ECG-gated navigator gated/corrected T2 prep 3D SSFP coronary MRI of the aortic root and coronary ostia were obtained in the axial plane.
The left atrial AP dimension was normal.
The right and left atrial lengths in the 4-chamber view were normal.
The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index and end-diastolic volume index were normal.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 66% with normal regional systolic function.
The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal.
The left ventricular mass index was normal.
The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal.
The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 67%, with normal free wall motion.
Aortic flow demonstrated no significant aortic regurgitation.
The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated no significant pulmonic or tricuspid regurgitation.
Coronary MR Imaging Normal origin and orientation of the left main coronary arteries.
The LAD and LCx had normal caliber and signal characteristics.
She was transfused for HCT of 20.
On POD #3, her epicardial wires were pulled and she underwent rest thallium study which was normal.
