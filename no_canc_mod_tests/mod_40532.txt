At [**Hospital1 **], his initial VS in ED were notable for HR 116, SpO2 92% 4L NC, BP 145/99.
Initial labs were notable for WBC 9.9, Hct 41.8, Cr 1.1, BNP 343 (ULN 100), TroI <0.06, d-dimer 831.
His EKG showed sinus tach with S1Q3T3.
Initial CXR showed no infiltrates.
He had a V/Q scan that was read as low probability for PE (could not get CTA [**1-16**] habitus).
LENIs were negative for DVT b/l.
TTE was limited but showed preserved LV function with EF 70%, concentric LVH, RV hypokinesis, and mild-mod pulm HTN.
A CXR on [**6-16**] AM showed multifocal patchy opacities, worsening on the right, most likely multifocal PNA vs atypical CHF or ARDS.
WBC noted to be 15 at that time.
His ABG was 7.42/38/46 on NRB.
He was intubated in the OR given concern for difficult intubation [**1-16**] habitus and low pO2 and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
Respiratory viral panel: Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2137-6-21**]):       No respiratory viruses isolated.
Culture screened for Adenovirus, Influenza A & B, Parainfluenza type       1,2 & 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus..
Detection of viruses other than those listed above will only be       performed on specific request.
Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2137-6-19**]):       Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
Refer to respiratory viral culture for further information.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH, <1000 CFU/ml.
Echo (TEE) [**6-19**]-IMPRESSION: Linear structure in the descending thoracic aorta as described above, cannot exclude aortic dissection.
If clinically indicated, a different imaging modality could be pursued.
EEG [**6-21**]-IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of diffuse slowing over both hemispheres suggestive of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
TEE showed LVEF 40% (down from EF 70% on TTE done at OSH), hypokinetic right ventricle, and trace mitral regurgitation.
Since pressors were weaned, his SBP's have been stable between 90's and 130's.
# Acute Kidney Injury: His Cr was found to be elevated on transfer and continued to rise during this hospitalization.
Cr has been trending down the last few days with Cr of 2.9 today, and urine outputs have picked up.
# Shocked liver: His AST and ALT were elevated [**1-16**] acute hepatitis from hypoperfusion.
His RUQ ultrasound showed normal liver and gallbladder mormophology.
With volume resuscitation and support for blood pressure, his AST and ALT have been trending down.
The EEG showed diffuse dysfunctions, but no epileptical activities.
He passed the speech and swallow evaluation and he should be able to take PO's.
# Anemia: His Hct was low on admission, but Hct stayed stable during the hospital course.
He was guaiac negative and labs were not suggestive of hemolysis.
