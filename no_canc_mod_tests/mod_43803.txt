He was urgently taken to cardiac cath where he was found to have complete acute occlusion of the proximal LAD with an completely occluded RCA and 90% occluded circumflex.
Bedside echo showed an VEF of 20-25% with 3+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 6**] aortic balloon pump was not placed because he has a tortuous aorta.
Physical Exam: VS: T 99.0 , BP 130/67  , HR 79 , RR 21 , O2 % 100 on  100% FIO2 MechVent.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit;  2+ DP Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit;  2+ DP  Pertinent Results: HEMODYNAMICS: Cardiac Output 4.7 Cardiac index 2.27 SVR 1209  LABORATORY DATA on admission: [**2137-2-21**] 08:40PM   GLUCOSE-132* UREA N-43* CREAT-2.2* SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-5.0 CHLORIDE-105 TOTAL CO2-20* ANION GAP-17 [**2137-2-21**] 08:40PM   CK(CPK)-6935* [**2137-2-21**] 08:40PM   CALCIUM-9.0 PHOSPHATE-4.1 MAGNESIUM-2.0 [**2137-2-21**] 08:40PM   WBC-21.9* RBC-4.62 HGB-12.4* HCT-37.1* MCV-80* MCH-26.8* MCHC-33.4 RDW-14.8 [**2137-2-21**] 08:40PM   NEUTS-92.8* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-3.9* MONOS-2.9 EOS-0.3 BASOS-0.1 [**2137-2-21**] 05:07PM   LACTATE-1.2  Laboratory Data on discharge: WBC 13.2, Hct 30.5, Plt 451 BUN/Cr 77/2.5 (stable from day prior) Na 139, K 5.0, Cl 105, HCO3 22, Glucose 126  [**8-22**] elevations in V1-V5; ST depressions in II, III, and aVF ; Q waves in V1-V5; and RBBB not seen on previous ECG.
#ECHO on [**2-21**]: LVEF = 20% ; 3+ MR ; Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
#Cardiac Catheterization on [**2137-2-21**] COMMENTS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and right sided filling pressures, cardiogenic shock with a PCWP of 40 with V waves to 55.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a overlapping 2.5 x 18 and 2.5 x 12 mm minivision stents which were post dilated with a 3.0 x 15 mm Quantum balloon.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
#Cardiac Catheterization on [**3-1**] COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed stent thrombosis within the previously placed proximal LAD distal BMS.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressures with an SBP of 120 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
# [**2-28**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler examination of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed.
By cardiac angiography he was found to have completely occluded proximal LAD, 80% occlusion of the Lcx and complete proximal occlusion of the RCA with distal flow from collaterals.
At cardiac catheterization he was found to have an LAD stent thrombosis that was opened with balloon angioplasty resulting in improved flow through the LAD stent.
# Pump: At presentation the patient developed cardiogenic shock and was found to have a PCWP of 40 with VEF 20% by echo with 3+ MR, and septal and anterolateral ventricular akenesis.
An IABP was not used becasue the patient has a tortutous aorta.
This can be titrated based on fluid status and blood pressure parameters.
Will need to have creatinine and potassium checked in 2 days at rehab facility.
The dose of amiodarone will be decreased and it is reasonable to initiate warfarin at 5mg and check frequent INR level to ensure he is not supratherapeutic and adjust as necessary.
Since, he has used up to 3L O2 by nasal canula after patient reported subjective dyspnea though he has maintained 02 saturations above 95%.
After ecoli was found in a sputum culture he completed a course of ciprofloxacin.
During initial cardiac catheterization he received  600cc dye load and  had episodes of hypotension.
His Cr peaked on [**2-23**] at 4.4 and then declined steadily declined to 2.4 on [**3-4**] despite receiving another 60cc dye load on [**3-1**].
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
The following changes has been made to your medications: - Please start taking aspirin 325mg daily for secondary cardiovascular prevention (to prevent another heart attack) - Please start taking atorvastatin 80mg daily for your heart and for your cholesterol - Please start taking Toprol XL 25mg daily for your heart and blood pressure (prevents remodelling of the heart) - Please start taking clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg daily to keep stents open.
You will need to have your blood pressure monitored with the addition of this medication.
