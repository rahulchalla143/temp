[**2199-7-31**] Renal Ultrasound 1.
Evaluation of resistive indices could not be accurately measured.
If clinically indicated, the study could be repeated at a later time point.
[**2199-7-30**] ECHO Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
A discrete ST-Junction is seen.
Trace - 1+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] biventricular systolic function.
[**2199-8-5**] CXR Resolving basilar atelectasis and persistent small pleural effusions.
An ultrasound was performed which revealed a single 3.6 x 1.9 cm pseudoaneurysm lying anterior to the distal right external iliac artery.
On postoperative day four, Mr. [**Known lastname 61260**] was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
