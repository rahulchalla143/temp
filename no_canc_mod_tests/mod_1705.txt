Cultures were drawn and she was given levofloxacin and flagyl given the abdominal pain.
Her initial lactate was 2.9, she had a WBC count of 20 with a left shift and 8% bands, and her creatinine was elevated at 1.3 from 0.9 3 months ago.
An abdominal CT was done to r/o an abscess (given that she's on chronic steroids) and it showed diverticulosis but no diverticulitis, as well as stable dilation of her CBD.
A central line was placed, and a mixed venous sat was monitored (low 70s).
She received an additional 2 liters of NS and her bp remained in the 90s.

PELVIS CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are diverticula in the sigmoid colon without evidence of diverticulitis.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the findings demonstrated on the axial images.
An ABG was drawn which revealed a pH of 7.00/30/167 with lactate of 17.
A femoral line was attempted but the wire could not be threaded.
Repeat ABG was 7.26/30/259 with a lactate of 9.6.
In the MICU, she was found to have a hct of 22.
Given that source of sepsis was not entirely clear (dirty u/a without urine cx) and with a concearn for occult bleed, CT abd was repeated.
CT abd/pelvis revealed no other infectious sources.
[**Month/Day (2) 4338**] liver showed large perihepatic bleed (stable) and an area of intraparenchymal hemprrhage in zone 8 of liver (no active contrast extravasation; no underlying lesion).
?CAD/CHF: cath w/ clean coronaries by regional WMA on LV gram and mildly depressed EF.
