The patient is home bound with a baseline oxygen saturation between 89% to 90% on room air, dropping to 86% with showering.
Spirometry on [**12-28**] revealed a FEV1 of 30% of predicted, vital capacity of 62% of predicted, with a FEV1:FVC ratio of 48%.
Compared to [**Month (only) **], FEV1 was reduced by 100 cc and the vital capacity was decreased by 300 cc.
An arterial blood gas at that time revealed the following numbers; 7.23/67/89.
The patient's heart rate on admission was 135, and he was given 10 mg intravenously of diltiazem for rate control.
The patient was given one dose of intravenous Levaquin and a Medical Intensive Care Unit evaluation was requested at that time.
Last echocardiogram revealed left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and mild apical hypokinesis.
Last catheterization revealed no clinical significance of stenosis, and no intervention.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on presentation revealed vital signs revealed blood pressure was 112/80, heart rate was 90, and temperature was 99.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed mucous membranes were moist.
Cardiovascular examination revealed very distant heart sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count was 17.9, hematocrit was 43, and platelets were 360.
Differential revealed 79.9% neutrophils and 16.5% lymphocytes.

Prothrombin time was 12.4, partial thromboplastin time was 28.8, and INR was 1.
Urinalysis revealed trace blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.
Toxicology screen was negative for aspirin, negative for alcohol, negative for Tylenol, negative for benzodiazepines, negative for barbiturates, and negative for tricyclics.
Arterial blood gas revealed the following numbers; 7.24/69/86.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 135 beats per minute, 0.5-mm ST segment depressions in the inferolateral leads.
A chest x-ray revealed hyperinflated lungs; consistent with the patient's severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
The patient underwent computed tomography angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism given the abrupt onset of his dyspnea, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure.
The computed tomography angiogram was negative for a pulmonary embolism.
RSBI was less than 100.
Physical examination revealed severe inspiratory stridor.
