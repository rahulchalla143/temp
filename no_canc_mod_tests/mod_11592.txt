The patient presented to his family physician on [**8-7**] and was found to have negative cardiac enzymes and negative electrocardiogram changes.
He was taken to [**Hospital6 8283**] where his troponin was found to be elevated at 0.
Thus, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization after being given aspirin, Lovenox, and Integrilin.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit around 9 p.m. chest pressure and without any other complaints.
Coronary artery disease; status post cardiac catheterization in [**2122**] revealing noncritical stenosis.
Multiple lacunar infarctions demonstrated via magnetic resonance imaging in [**2133-3-23**].
He has a brother who had an angioplasty done at the age of 41, and he has various uncles who died of heart attacks in their early 60s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed temperature was 97.3, blood pressure was 159/72, pulse was 70, respiratory rate was 18, oxygen saturation 99% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
His trachea was midline, and his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, without any murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Neurologic examination demonstrated that cranial nerves II through XII were intact.
His reflexes were 2+ symmetrically and bilaterally with downgoing Babinski.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count was 12.2, hemoglobin was 14.2, hematocrit was 40.2, platelets were 239.
Differential revealed 62 neutrophils, 26 lymphocytes, 5 monocytes, 6 eosinophils, and 1 basophil.
PT was 13.1, PTT was 34, INR was 1.2.
Sodium was 142, potassium was 3.6, chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 18, creatinine was 1, blood glucose was 87.
Calcium was 9.4, magnesium was 1.7, phosphorous was 2.8.
AST was 25, LDH was 174.
Triglycerides were 218, high-density lipoprotein was 26, low-density lipoprotein was 63.
Creatine kinases peaked at 220, MB fractions peaked at 14, MB index peaked at 6.4, troponin peaked at 19.4.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray on [**8-10**] revealed cardiomegaly; otherwise clear.
Electrocardiogram taken on [**8-10**] prior to catheterization revealed a normal sinus rhythm, with a ventricular rate at 60, left axis deviation, normal intervals, left ventricular hypertrophy, and 1-mm ST elevations in leads V1 through V3.
Cardiac catheterization on [**8-11**] revealed a right-dominant circulation with 1-vessel and branch vessel coronary artery disease.
An echocardiogram on [**8-12**] revealed an ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 55%.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggested impaired relaxation.
Otherwise, there were no wall motion abnormalities, and the rest of the echocardiogram was within normal limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**8-10**] at around 9 p.m. to the Intensive Care Unit for overnight observation before his cardiac catheterization the next morning.
His outpatient dipyridamole was held during this hospital stay.
He was placed on telemetry monitoring and remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout his hospital stay without any signs of increased ectopy.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization on the morning of [**8-12**] without any complications and was transferred to the Cardiac Stepdown Unit floor afterwards.
He remained chest pain free throughout his hospital course, and an echocardiogram was performed on the morning of [**8-12**] to evaluate his ejection fraction and assess for any wall motion abnormalities.
His complete blood count and his electrolytes were checked on a daily basis; and his potassium, magnesium, and calcium were repleted as needed.
His ins-and-outs were monitored closely.
His creatinine remained stable throughout his hospital course.
Pulmonary wise, his oxygen saturations remained excellent on minimal nasal cannula and then eventually room air.
His hematocrit remained stable status post cardiac catheterization, and his groin site was monitored closely for any signs or symptoms of hematoma or excessive bleeding.
