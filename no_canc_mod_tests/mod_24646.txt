His wife brought him in a wheelchair to [**Hospital **] Hosp, where his temp was noted to be 103 F. CXR was purportedly suggestive of a mild LLL PNA.
He had apparently been dropping his sat and was placed on a NRB.
At 2:50 am, O2 sat noted to be 88% on NRB and though still awake, he was becoming lethargic.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and obtained an emergent MRI pan-spine showing significant epidural fluid collection, likely blood, possibly infected.
Notably, pt comes with CT head and CT-spine reports from [**5-22**] with an indication for "L arm numbness."
She also notes that he had an HIV test 1 month ago that was negative.

Cervical spine CT would also be useful to assess for posterior element fractures.
Cervical spondylosis, worst at C5-6 and C6-7, with spinal cord deformity and abnormal cord signal, could be edema or myelomalacia.

Evening CXR unchanged, ++increased secretions.
briefly, was intubated at OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent evaluation and treatment of paralysis requiring intubation prior to transfer.
Please call the office if you have a fever>101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, drainage from your wound, or have any questions.
