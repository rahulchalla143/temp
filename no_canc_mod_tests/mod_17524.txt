The patient has three children with two girls at the ages of 23 and  21 with hepatitis B. the oldest son does not have hepatitis B   Physical Exam: 98.6 112/69 72 20 94%RA GEN: illappearing, tearfull, obese HEENT: icteric sclera, jaundiced skin CV: rrr s1, s2, no M/g/R RESP: diffuse wheezing bilaterally ABD: tender to palpation, obese, +bs, site of paracentesis is still draining fluid EXT: tense pitting edema bilaterally Neuro: AAOx3, 5/5 strength, sensation intact, no flap.
Hemostasis was then obtained, patient tolerated the procedure well without any immediate post-procedure complications.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2157-1-1**] 5:41 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: assess for loculation  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 52 year old woman with cirrhosis with large ascites, tap with only 1L removed, assess for loculation REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for loculation CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: not needed  INDICATION: 52-year-old female with cirrhosis and large ascites with recent 1 liter of fluid removed via paracentesis.
This examination is limited due to artifact created from the patient's body habitus, particularly on the right of the abdomen and pelvis.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The uterus and adnexa are unremarkable.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-11-3**], the estimated pulmonary pressures are moderately elevated and the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
FINDINGS: Limited [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale imaging of the abdomen was performed to assess for underlying ascites.
CT abdomen showed ascites fluid in difficult to reach locations, along paracolic gutters and in pelvis.
Hepatitis B was thought to be a precipitating factor.
A viral load was checked and came back at 6700 copies.
On initial presentaiton her sodium was low at 123 and her creatinine was elevated to 1.3.
Her creatinine improved but her urine output and peripheral edema remained unchanged.
Her creatinine, sodium, and urine output remained unchanged.
Her nadolol, lactulose, and midodrine were continued.
HD (ultrafiltration) was attempted in order to take off more fluid but her blood pressures did not tolerate much fluid loss.
CXR showed vascular congestion.
A morning cortisol was measured and was found to be normal.
Her ekg did not show changes consistent with hyperkalemia.
She was given kayexalate to keep her potassium under 5.0; this was not an issue later in the admission.
Once she was made comfort measures only her labs were no longer obtained.
Much of her workup was completed at outside hospitals.
She recived a transplant workup and psychiatry consult during this hospitalization.
A colonoscopy is being considered.
The source of the BRBPR was not clear, since she sometimes also had maroon stool; the possibility existed that some food dye or medicine could have been responsible for some of the color; however, a colonoscopy and workup for GI bleeding was secondary to trying to see if the patient might become eligible for a liver.
Her hematocrit was stable at last check before suspending lab draws.
