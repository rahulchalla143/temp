Micro: Blood cultures X2 no growth to date; Urine culture no growth to date .
Studies: CXR ([**2160-1-23**]): The cardiomediastinal silhouette is currently more clearly identified consistent with mild cardiac enlargement.
CXR ([**1-21**]): Moderate left pleural effusion has worsened.
CXR ([**1-20**]): Endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet.

The third chest xray performed after extubation and sufficient diuresis showed no concerning infiltrates/[**Last Name (LF) 75026**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the antibiotics were discontinued.
Cardiac enzymes were negative (baseline slightly elevated troponin given renal disease) for concern of myocardial ischemia causing CHF exacerbation.
