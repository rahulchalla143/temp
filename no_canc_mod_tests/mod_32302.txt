BCx - negative, ascitic fluid negative, fluid collection showing VRE, UCx initially negative, then growing yeast.
Sputum Cx with budding yeast, 3+ 2 days prior to death.
CT abd/pelvis: [**2-25**] .
CXR [**2-25**]: .
CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Band-like linear density of the left lung base corresponds to atelectasis seen on subsequent CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
ECHO [**3-2**]: .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function.
Hyperdynamic left ventricular function (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-7-10**], the ventricular rate is now faster, the ventricular function is now hyperdynamic and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension is now present.
CXR [**3-3**], MICU transfer day: .
KUB [**3-3**]: .
CTA abd/pelvis [**3-3**]; .
ECHO [**3-4**]: .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Hyperdynamic systolic function, consistent with low systemic vascular resistance .
CXR [**3-4**]: .
His bilirubin continued to rise during the admission.
Paracentesis was repeated on [**3-1**] and was negative.
The BCx were pending at time of transfer to MICU, UCx were negative to date, there was no SBP and fluid collection preliminary cultures were negative, however smear was with 4+ PMNs.
WBC was stable, patient was started on Zosyn empirically for a presumed intraabdominal infection and restarted on Linezolid.
Serial exams showed worsening ascites and increasing lethargy and weakness.
ECHO was obtained to assess for Cx negative endocarditis as a possible source due to worsening murmur on exam, no vegetations were noted.
His ABG was 66* 34* 7.14*4 12, showing severe acidosis and hypoxemia.
Lactate was 12.4.
No EGD reports in OMR, but per GI notes, EGD from [**2151**]8 did not show varices.
Baseline 0.6 - 0.8, Na < 10 in urine.
Cr was 0.9 on admission, however increased to 1.5 by HD4.
It improved to 1.0 w/ 2U PRBCs and 50g albumin x2.
Patient had slight hydronephrosis on CT [**2-13**].
Fluid collection cultures eventually grew VRE.
BCx were negative and Sputum and Urine showed budding yeast.
