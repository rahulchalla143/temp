HPOA could have a similar appearance and note is made of the recent chest radiograph dated [**2120-4-4**].
[**2120-3-26**] CT Chest w/o con: Newly occurred massive consolidations and opacities, predominating in the upper lobes but also visualized in the peribronchial areas of the middle lobe and both lower lobes.
[**2120-3-28**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1.
[**2120-4-2**] CT Head w/o con: Moderately motion limited study without evidence of an acute intracranial process.
CTA negative for PE, but showed multifocal PNA.
Had repeat CT chest, which showed worsening of multifocal PNA with bilateral patchy consolidations.
Sputum cultures sent, but only positive for rare yeast, and all blood cultures remained negative.
As below, patient started on CRRT on [**4-3**], and chest imaging did show improvement in bilateral pulmonary congestion.
CT head [**4-2**] was negative for acute intracranial process.
Patient had h/o recent AIN from nafcillin, and urinalysis still revealed rare eosinophils.
Renal consulted, and felt presentation most c/w ischemic injury based on presence of granular casts and sheets of hyaline casts in urine.
Urine output continued to decline, and patient became nearly anuric with ~100cc urine output daily.
Decreased urine output was also exacerbated by increased bladder pressures, noted to be as high as 28 in setting of worsening ascites and abdominal distension on [**3-31**].
Goal was for removal of 100-200cc/hr if BP would tolerate, and arterial line placed for closer BP monitoring.
Joint fluid culture did grow pseudomonas, and patient started on cipro.
All other cultures remained negative, and cipro later d/c'd as this was felt to be contaminant and not true infection by ID consulting team.
Had about 1.5L blood loss during operation, requiring additional transfusions of pRBCS and FFP.
Fluid pocket felt to be hematoma and not infection, and cultures sent from OR [**3-25**] negative.
Had therapeutic thoracentesis on [**3-18**] during which 2 L of fluid were removed, chemistries were unremarkable.
Had repeat paracentesis [**3-21**] with removal of 3L fluid, and another paracentesis on [**3-25**] which was also negative for SBP.
Had additional paracentesis on [**4-15**] (3L fluid removed each time).
Several stool samples negative for C. diff, and flagyl eventually stopped [**3-29**] after C. diff PCR came back negative.
