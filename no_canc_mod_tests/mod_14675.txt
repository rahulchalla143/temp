Sodium 145, potassium 4.4, chloride 105, bicarbonate 26.5, BUN 28, creatinine 0.9, glucose 82, INR of 1.1.
Emergent angiogram was arranged which revealed on [**2123-5-31**], marked aortoiliac disease with severe stenosis of the proximal left common iliac artery, occluded left superficial femoral artery, which reconstituted above the knee and the popliteal artery on the left which occluded just below the knee joint.
A chest x-ray on [**2123-5-31**], revealed bilateral predominantly lower zone interstitial changes, possibly due to chronic interstitial fibrosis but no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities identified.
In addition, preoperative Urology consultation was obtained which revealed a distal urethral stricture.
Postoperatively, the patient went to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit where he was on a Nitroglycerin drip for blood pressure control.
A chest x-ray on [**2123-6-7**], was noted to have an opacity in the retrocardiac region suggestive of pneumonia with a persistent bilateral interstitial pattern likely due to congestive heart failure.
