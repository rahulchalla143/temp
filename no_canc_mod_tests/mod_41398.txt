IMPRESSION: Limited study with echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration or cirrhosis; advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Lung volumes are markedly diminished.
The cardiac silhouette, though accentuated by low lung volumes is stable in size.
Bilirubin trended down to nadir of 13.9, but then stabilized around 14-15.
Her sugars were monitorred on high dose steroids but she did not require any insulin administration, likely a result of impaired gluconeogenesis.
Urine culture grew E. coli.
Antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone when urine culture data/sensitivies became available.
Head CT was negative.
She was maintained Ativan 1-2mg IV q2 hours with CIWA >10.
LENI of the left leg was negative for DVT, with CXR without infiltrate.
Blood cultures are pending at the time of discharge.
The patient was guaiac positive, with INR 2.1 in the setting of decompensated liver disease and alcohol abuse.
She received 2 unit of PRBCs and bumped hct appropriately.
Iron studies were done but are unrelieable after blood transfusion.
Her hematocrit was stable around 25 for the week prior to discharge.
She will need iron studies performed as an outpatient.
There was also an element of functional weakness as the patient was able to hold her leg up upon exam.
