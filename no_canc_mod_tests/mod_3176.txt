CXR ([**3-6**]): FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is moderate overdistention of the stomach.
Urine/serum tox were negative, UA was unremarkable, and CXR showed no pneumonia.
EEG showed a slower than normal background, generalized right hemisphere slowing, and bifrontal slowing right greater than left consistent with a mild encephalopathy as well as subcortical dysfunction more prominent on the right.
His [**Month/Day (3) 17802**] was continued at 200/500, and his Gabpentin was increased to 300 mg tid.
