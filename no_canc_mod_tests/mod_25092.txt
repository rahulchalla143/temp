MICRO: urine cx neg blood cx NGTD CMV VL pending .
IMAGING: CT C/A/P:1.
A pelvic ultrasound may be useful for further evaluation.
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Anemia/pancytopenia: Patient presented with a very impressive Hct of 6.
CT C/A/P did not reveal any acute bleed.
Patient was transfused 4 U PRBC, with post-transfusion Hct 21.
Several studies including B12, folate, iron studies, DIC [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], dsDNA, PNH [**First Name3 (LF) **], EBV, CMV, HIV viral loads, parvovirus Ab.
Peripheral smear was consistent with B12 deficiency and ineffective hematopoiesis.
Hemolysis was also consistent with severe B12 deficiency.
These should be repeated after 7 days, as should iron studies since patient will likely need iron supplementation as hematopoiesis increases.
Patient has appt with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 18619**] on Fri. [**2185-1-14**].
Platelet count was slightly trending down from 90 to 70s and should continue to be monitored.
TTE was done, which showed normal EF, however this does not rule out high output state.
