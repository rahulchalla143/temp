Per patient report and record patient with h/o with choledocolithiasis s/p gallbladder removal in [**2134**] which was complicated by cystic stump leak s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placment with further complication of duodenal perforation.
The patient underwent CT scan that showed a 5x7mm in the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilation with air concerning for gas-forming organism.
Her baseline SBP are usually in the 90's per report.
She had documented pressures as low as the 60's at the OSH.
The patient's labs were significant leukocytosis of 11.7, Hct 29.7.
LFT were remarkable for TBili 7.3, AP 243, ALT: 95 and AST 40.

IMPRESSION: Prominent mediastinal contour and nodular right apical opacity, for which dedicated contrast-enhanced Chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
Please call the on call ERCP fellow at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**] with any immediate concerns such as fever, abdominal pain, bleeding, following your procedure.
Repeat ERCP in 3 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for stent removal and reassement of duct for residual stone or stricture.
CT CHEST: IMPRESSION: A roughly 11-mm wide right upper lobe nodule corresponding to lesion seen on recent chest radiograph should be considered malignant until proved otherwise.
Otherwise PET CT scanning or short-term followup in three months would constitute imaging management.
CT scan from OSH demonstrated pneumobilia and a stone in the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilation.
ERCP was consulted and patient underwent uncomplicated ERCP on [**2144-1-16**].
Repeat LFTs showed improved T. bili, with mild transaminitis.
She was transitioned to Cipro/Flagyl for which she will need a 14 day total course - she will need repeat ERCP in 3 weeks - we recommend repeating LFTs on PCP follow up.
# Chest CT Abnormalities: Hilar and right apical abnormalities noted on initial CXR and on repeat PA/Lateral.
CT scan showed prelim read was 11 x 9mm pulmonary nodule in the right apex, also with right apical and basilar lung acarring/atelectasis.
PET/CT can be considered for evaluation of metabolic activity).
Final read: A roughly 11-mm wide right upper lobe nodule corresponding to lesion seen on recent chest radiograph should be considered malignant until proved otherwise.
Otherwise PET CT scanning or short-term followup in three months would constitute imaging management.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment of your cholangitis.
Please follow-up with your primary care physician regarding the pulmonary nodule found on your chest CT as soon as possible.
