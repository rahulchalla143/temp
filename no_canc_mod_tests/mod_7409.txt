History of Present Illness: Patient is an 85-year-old woman with h/o critical aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.5 cm2, peak gradient 74), dCHF with exacerbation in [**10/2142**] c/b paroxysmal atrial fibrillation now on amiodorone, NSTEM versus demand ischemia ([**10/2142**]) on aspirin and Plavix (both stopped on [**4-6**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of hip fracture and hypotension.
She presented to OSH where x-ray showed evidence of L-hip intertrochanteric fracture.
SBP at time of transfer 92/43, HR 72, satting 96-97% 2L.
Past Medical History: - critical aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.5 cm2) on echocardiogram [**2141**] - diagnosed initially in [**10/2142**] - congestive heart failure with grade 3 diastolic dysfunction (with evidence of LVH on EKG from OSH) - NSTEMI [**10/2142**] ?demand ischemia, no intervention - hypertension - chronic back pain - status post cataract surgery - status post cholecystectomy  Social History: Lives at home by herself.

Left hip x-ray ([**4-7**]): Very limited exam due to technique.
Evaluation of lateral femoral condyle deformity limited and of uncertain chronicity.
Chest x-ray ([**4-7**]): Severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement have worsened indicating progressive cardiac decompensation.
Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**4-8**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibotor or [**Last Name (un) **].
CT orbit, sella, and IAC without contrast ([**4-8**]): Bilateral soft tissue masses centered within the external auditory canals most likely represent keratosis obturans, more advanced on the right.
Cardiac cath [**4-9**] COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angigoraphy in this right-dominant system demonstrated no flow-limiting coronary disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided fillign pressures, with an RVEDP of 20 mm HG and a PCWP of 25 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.5 L/min/m2.
The systemic arterial blood pressure was normal.
[**4-15**] CXR Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are larger on the left side minimmaly increased on the right.

DIRECT ANTIGEN TEST FOR VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS (Final [**2143-4-16**]):       REPORTED BY PHONE TO E.O'DONNEL [**2143-4-16**] AT 1545.
BACTERIAL CXS PENDING ON DC  External auditory canal:    GRAM STAIN (Final [**2143-4-8**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2143-4-11**]):       WORK-UP DISCONTINUED Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony       types) an abbreviated workup will be performed appropriate to the       isolates recovered from this site.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
URINE CX: NO GROWTH   Brief Hospital Course: In summary this is an 85-year-old woman with critical AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.5 cm2) presenting from OSH for treatment of left-hip fracture after mechanical fall at home.
They initially recommended metoprolol (given low dose 12.5mg) but then recommended she have cardiac catheterization and may require cardiac surgery prior to orthopedic procedure.
Skin scrapings were positive for VSV, cxs pending on discharge.
Bacterial cxs were still pending on DC.
She was given gentle IV fluid boluses and transfused to maintain hct >28.
With these interventions, her blood pressure improved and systolic pressures stabilized between 90-100. .
She has critical aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of less than 0.8 cm2.
Although symptomatic at home, further evaluation for repair was on hold given multiple comorbidities and pt unwillingness to participate in rehab.
Iron studies were indicative of deficiency.
# Acute on chronic sCHF: pt with some evidence of volume overload this admission, requiring 1-2 L O2 by nasal cannula, weaned by time of admission with sats in 90s.
Urine cx with no growth.
# Soft tissue in the right external auditory canal: per OSH CT report.
Exam was notable for pus in the right external auditory canal.
ENT service was consulted and  noted the left ear with impacted cerumen; right ear had a perforated tympanic membrane and whitish fluid; suspect cholesteatooma; no antibiotics needed but will need outpatient follow-up.
FULL code, confirmed with daughter and HCP # Communication.

You will need to follow up with ENT for further evaluation on discharge.
