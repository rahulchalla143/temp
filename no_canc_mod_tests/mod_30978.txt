Admission Date:  [**2157-3-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2157-4-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2080-5-23**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**] CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension and bradycardia with electrocardiogram changes post laminectomy procedure.
Immediately, postoperatively, the patient became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s and bradycardic with a pulse in the 40s with lateral electrocardiogram changes.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2137**] with cardiac catheterization in [**2137**] and [**2151**].
Persantine thallium in [**2156-2-5**] reportedly negative for reversible defects with an ejection fraction of 53%, however, mild inferior thinning was noted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vitals on transfer were as follows:  Temperature 96.7.
Pulse of 60.
Blood pressure 143/45.
Oxygen saturation of 96% on three liters.
PERTINENT ADMISSION STUDIES:  White blood cell count 15.5, hematocrit 32.1, platelets 148,000, PT 13.1, INR 1.2, PTT 26.3.
Sodium 136, potassium 5.2, chloride 103, bicarbonate 25, BUN 47, creatinine 1.6 with a baseline creatinine of approximately 1.3.
Glucose 178, calcium 8.5, phosphorus 3.5, magnesium 1.5.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 54 and axis of 100, intervals of 164, 110, [**Street Address(2) 98150**] depressions in II, III and aVF and new ST depressions in V4 through V6 when compared to previous tracing of [**2157-3-21**].
His cardiac enzymes were cycled with a peak CK of [**2126**], but an MB of only 31 and an index of 1.6.
His troponin was noted to be 13.5.
The decision was made to take the patient to cardiac catheterization after esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
The catheterization showed native two vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to D1 grafts.
His ejection fraction was noted to be 48% on left ventriculogram.
Decision was made to medically manage his hypertension and as such his beta-blocker was increased and an ACE inhibitor was initiated.
Infectious Disease:  The patient had an acute elevation in his white blood cell count to 23.1 with a possible left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray on the day after his laminectomy.
As it became clear that he did not have a wound infection and the blood cultures returned without growth, the vancomycin was discontinued.
Renal:  The patient has known chronic renal insufficiency believed secondary to his diabetes and hypertension; baseline creatinine is approximately 1.3.
Peak creatinine was 1.9.
By time of discharge, his creatinine was 1.4 and trending towards baseline.
Nasogastric lavage revealed coffee grounds.
As there was a possibility of cardiac catheterization in the near future, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed in the peri myocardial infarction period.
