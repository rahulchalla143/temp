Similarly distended gallbladder compared to eight days prior, without CT evidence for cholecystitis.
Abdominal U/S [**2139-12-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
No gallbladder wall thickening or edema, pericholecystic fluid, or focal tenderness over the gallbladder during the examination is seen.
Portable CXR [**2139-12-30**]: The ET tube tip is 3.7 cm above the carina.
Initially PE was considered and the patient was started on heparin drip briefly, however determined to be unlikely based on septic physiology.
Unlikely cardiogenic pulmonary edema as initial mixed venous sat was in the 80s.
However, a repeat mixed venous sat the following day was 46.
A TTE was done at the bedside to evaluate for cardiogenic cause of respiratory failure, and found to have a globally decreased EF, consistent with septic physiology.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy and BAL which were unrevealing to cause.
As the patient became more difficult to ventilate and CXRs showed progression of bilateral infiltrates despite volume removal and antibiotics, a contrast CT scan was done which showed large bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the right than left, ground glass infiltrates and airbronchograms especially on the left.
# Shock:  The patient had bandemia of 41%, fever, tachypnea, and elevated lactate on admission with evidence of a pulmonary source on CXR, however blood cultures were not drawn on admission.
Other sources considered were endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pancreatitis, and other intra-abdominal process, however pneumonia was thought to be the source after thorough evaluation of other possibilities.
Multiple cultures were sent from sputum, blood, urine, pleural fluid, BALs however all following the administration of IV antibiotics and all found to be negative.
Chest compressions were started, he was shocked once and spontaneous circulation returned.
At that time, his electrolytes were within normal limits.
His bedside US did not show evidence of a pericardial effusion, his labs were unremarkable.
Hepatitis serologies were negative.
# Back pain:  R-sided, was tender to palpation over R mid-back.
