Per report from the patients wife, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] saw him in clinic on [**7-17**] and sent him in for evaluation of TIPS pressures because of the recent GI bleed.

ECHO [**2177-7-17**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-5-14**], the aortic valve vegetation appears smaller.
Maximum peak velocities in the proximal, mid and distal portion of the TIPS catheter are overall unchanged since the prior study.

TIPS ballooning was done without complication and resulted in reduction in portocaval pressure gradient from 20 to 7 mmHg.
The patient underwent EGD on [**7-21**] which showed 2 cords of grade III varices and 1 grade II varix in the lower third of the esophagus with no evidence of bleeding.
Repeat EGD [**2177-7-22**] on demonstrated stigmata of recent bleeding from varices and 6 bands were placed.
He was started on carafate x 14 days with [**Hospital1 **] HCT checks, which remained stable.
He had a scheduled repeat EGD to evaluate his varices on [**2177-7-29**] and was found to have 4 cords of grade III varices and 2 additional bands were placed on varices without bands.
The patient continued to improve and was nearing discharge until [**7-31**], when he began to have worsening mental status and his hematocrit dropped from 26.4 to 22.7 over the course of the day.
He became relatively tachycardic with HR in 90s from a baseline in the 60s-70s, with BP ranging 81-107/33-48.
Repeat EGD in the MICU showed no evidence of active bleeding, and the team felt that bleeding was thought to be most likely from peri-ligation ulcers.
HCT stabilized, and he was transferred to the floor in stable condition.
Of note, while in the MICU, there was a transfusion mismatch and he was given RhoGam.
The blood bank was aware of the event.
HCT remained stable for remainder of hospital course.
He was scheduled for follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for repeat endoscopy and a clinic appointment.
Repeat U/S showed patent TIPS.
He underwent repeat echo during admission, confirming AI and AV vegetation (known).
# Thrombocytopenia - The patient had thrombocytopenia with platelet levels in the 30s-50s.
