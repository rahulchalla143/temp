CXR showed a R. sided pleural effusion and a CT torso revealed multiple filling defects which were felt to represent chronic pulmonary emboli and not an acute process.

However, pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded and clinical correlation is recommended .
CTA & CT ABD/PELVIS, [**2142-11-27**]- 1.
Followup CT exam within three months is recommended.
ECHO (TTE), [**2142-11-28**]- Conclusions:  The left atrium is markedly dilated.
CXR, portable, [**2142-11-29**]- Reason: evaluate for PTX s/p R thoracentesis In comparison with the study of [**11-27**], there has been removal of a substantial amount of fluid from the right pleural space.
REST THALLIUM, VIABILITY SCAN, [**2142-11-30**]- 1.
CXR, PA & LAT, [**2142-12-1**] 12:03pm- Reason: Questionable reaccumulation of right pleural effusion.
The lungs are clear except for unchanged opacity in the right mid lung consistent with area of atelectasis demonstrated on a torso CT from [**2142-11-27**].
CXR, portable, [**2142-12-1**] 4:19pm- Reason: Evaluate acute pulmonary edema, patient with acute shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 15%.
Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST, [**2142-12-4**]- Reason: Please assess pulmonary "nodules" noted in [**2142-11-27**] CTA for round atelectasis [**2-23**] CHF vs. masses, suspicious for malignancy.
CXR, portable, [**2142-12-7**]- Reason:  post lung biopsy Comparison: Chest radiographs of [**2142-12-1**], CT of the chest from [**2142-12-4**], as well as screen capture images from CT-guided lung biopsy performed earlier on the same day.
Multiple lung lesions are better evaluated on the CT scan of three days prior.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2142-12-10**]: 1.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated an LMCA, LAD, LCX and RCA all without angiographically significant disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely depressed cardiac index of 1.3 L/min/sq meter.
Pulmonary artery pressures were markedly elevated, as were biventricular filling pressures.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo Haitian-Creole-speaking female who presented with shortness of [**Month/Day/Year 1440**] and unclear past medical history, revealed to have R pleural effusion, EF 15-20% on Echo, chronic PEs and R DVT, and pulmonary nodules on CT of unclear etiology .
Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: On admission the patient was complaining of shortness of [**Month/Day/Year 1440**] and was found to have a BNP in the 7535.
She was found on echocardiogram to have severe global hypokinesis, with etiology unclear and no focal abnormality.
Prior to this admission she was not taking any medications for her congestive heart failure despite being diagnosed with heart failure at [**Hospital 8**] hospital in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year and was found to have an ejection fraction of 24%.
Additional cardiac medications were gradually added during the admission, and her SBP held in the 80s-100s.
A cardiac catheterization on [**12-10**] was significant for no angiographically apparent disease in all vessels, a CI of 1.3, SVR 3015, and elevated biventricular filling pressures as well as PA pressures.
Her baseline SBP was 80s-90s, but she was asymptomatic without lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain or shortness of [**Month/Year (2) 1440**].
Of note she also had a CT scan during her admission to [**Hospital 8**] hospital in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year at which time she was also noted to have "ground glass opacities, peribronchial thickening and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as well as a small right pleural effusion."
She underwent bronchoscopy and biopsy at [**Hospital 8**] hospital which was negative in [**Month (only) 116**] but was not directed.
She underwent CT guided biopsy of a nodule during this hospitalization which was negative for malignancy but showed reactive cells.
She underwent three induced sputum samples which were AFB stain negative for tuberculosis.
She will likely need a VATS biopsy as an outpatient for further investigation of these nodules.
Per her records from [**Hospital 8**] hospital it appears that the vaginal bleeding is chronic and was worked up with a transvaginal ultrasound in [**2142-5-22**] which revealed a 5 mm endometrial stripe.
She had a CT guided biopsy of her pulmonary nodules which was negative for malignancy.
On discharge her INR was 2.3.
On admission she had a CT scan which was consistent with acute cholecystitis.
Vulvar Swelling: On admission ER physical exam the patient was noted to have "multiple vulvar lesions."
On my initial physical exam she pointed out a 1x1 cm  firm nodule in labia minora which she says has been present since she gave birth to her children.
Breast Lumps: On admission physical exam the patient was noted to have a "soft, mobile, non-tender 1.5-2cm lump at the 2:00 position on the right breast and a small, firm, non-tender lump in the 10:00 position on her right breast (exam on [**2142-11-28**])."
In records from her previous hospitalization at [**Hospital 8**] hospital she was also noted to have vaginal bleeding and underwent transvaginal ultrasound which revealed a 5 mm endometrial strip no specific abnormalities.
She did have a pelvic exam during this hospitalization which revealed scant blood in the vaginal canal.
[**Month (only) 116**] need to consider repeat ultrasound and endometrial biopsy as an outpatient.
Patient does have a number of pulmonary nodules and underwent CT guided biopsy which was negative for malignant cells and showed reactive cells.
On exam she has a rash on her back, chest and the soles of her feet.
Prophylaxis: Given her known history of blood clots she was anticoagulated with heparin with a bridge to coumadin.
Hemoptysis 6.
Positive PPD 7.
Pulmonary nodules 9.
You underwent CT-guided biopsy of a pulmonary nodule, which was negative for malignancy.
