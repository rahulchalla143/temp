An MRI was obtainted to rule out a AVM, metatsis or anuerysm.
He MRI work up was negative for all those possible diagnosis.
A repeat head CT on [**10-5**] showed a stable clot.
His second hospital Mr [**Known lastname **] remained solumlent, a stroke neurology consult was obtainted to rule out stroke, they recommened a toxic metabolic workup and transfusion as his hct was again low to 24.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] also dropped to 58, his SQ Heparin held due to the possibility of HIT.
His ICP pressure remained in the 6-8 range.
On [**10-10**] an ID consult was obtained due to fever work up showed [**12-1**] blood culutes was postive for GPC, he was started on 2 weeks of Vancomycin.
A CBC showed increased esophinicils, even more suspicious for dilantin related to fever.
His Dilantin was D/C'd on [**10-25**] and he had no further fevers  Mr [**Known lastname **] had his ventriculostomy drain discontinued on [**10-13**], on [**10-14**] a follow up LP was done which had a opening pressure of 26.
on [**10-19**] a Lumbar drain was placed without complications.
On [**10-31**] he was brought to the OR and had a VP shunt placed and his Lumbar drain was d/c'd.
Postoperatively, he did well however a follow-up CT showed nonoptimal positioning of his VP shunt in the ventricle.
Follow up CT showed good placement, neurologically he was awake, alert and orientated, walking without difficulty.
He had a CSF culture from [**11-2**] positive for staph coag neg, felt to be a contaminent.
On [**11-4**] the patient complained of severe abdominal pain and a general surgery consult was obtained and the patient had a KUB which showed free air under the diaphragm.
He was transfered to the ICU and intubated, Patient had an abd Ct which showed a high grade bowel obstruction.
He then developed elevated amylase and lipase and was treated with bowel rest for pancreatitis.
From the neurosurgical standpoint, he was getting serial LP's and eventually his opening pressures came back into the normal range he no longer required  LP's.
patient continued to be followed by ID for CSF infection and a positive intra-operative swab which was positive for enterococcus.
His last LP was on [**11-14**] with an opening pressure of 14.
he remained neurologically stable with evaluation of his amylase and lipase daily.
