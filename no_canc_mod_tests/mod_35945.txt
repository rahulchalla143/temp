GRAM STAIN (Final [**2128-7-14**]): [**11-18**] PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated mean PCPW of 13mmHg with an elevated PAP of 50/11.
Cardiac index was low normal at 2l/min/m2.
[**2128-7-13**] CXR compared to [**2128-3-29**] IMPRESSION: Reexpanded left lower lobe with residual atelectasis in bilateral lung bases.
[**2128-7-14**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1.
A non-contrast CT could be repeated after treatment, to assess for clearing in this region.
Alternatively, bronchoscopy could be performed.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 85 yo male with severe CAD s/p CABGx2, bioprosthetic MVR, ischemic CM with EF 25% who presents with worsening shortness of breath.
We continued the patient's aspirin, statin, B-blocker and held his ACE-I for the first night while diuresis was attempted.
The patient is well rate controlled and a beta-blocker was continued, however at a lower dose.
The patient is not anticoagulated because of CHF and risk of hemoptysis, which has happend to him in the past.
Wedge pressure of 13 suggests no severe back pressure although he does have poor cardiac output.
High PA pressures suggest pulm HTN of unclear cause.
A sputum gram stain revealed gram positive cocci in chains, pairs and clusters.
#) CRI: patient's creatinine was near baseline.

We performed a right heart cath which suggested that you were in slight cardiac failure.
We made some minor adjustments as follows: - stopped your amiodarone - continue levoflox (antibiotic) for 10 days - decreased carvedilol to 3.125 [**Hospital1 **] .
We performed a chest CT scan which demonstrated a possible mass in the right side of your lung.
This likely is secondary to your infection but we recommend a followup CT scan once your infection resolves to assess for interval change.
