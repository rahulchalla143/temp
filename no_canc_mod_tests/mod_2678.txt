Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2101-12-27**] 11:10AM   PT-13.0 PTT-28.1 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2101-12-27**] 11:14AM   GLUCOSE-115* LACTATE-1.7 NA+-137 K+-4.9 CL--95* TCO2-23 [**2101-12-27**] 12:30PM   WBC-6.8# RBC-2.88* HGB-11.0* HCT-34.4* MCV-119* MCH-38.3* MCHC-32.1 RDW-14.8 [**2101-12-27**] 08:20PM   FIBRINOGEN-276  Micro: [**12-29**] Blood Cx: budding yeast [**12-28**] Urine Cx: E.Coli [**12-29**] C.diff negative  Imaging - CT abd/pelvis [**12-27**]: 1.
-Echo [**12-29**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
An echodensity associated with the anterior mitral leaflet, on its atrial aspect is seen, most likely representing an acoustic artifact, but a vegetation cannot be excluded with certainty.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-2-24**], the findings are similar.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended.
Echo [**1-2**]: Thickened mitral leaflets with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, but no discrete vegetation.
Patient had no further bleeding after first night of admission and hematocrit was stable, but was critically ill throughout her stay so no surgical intervention or workup of the fistula was pursued.
Her BP dropped to 80's/40's and she was intubated.
# Septic Shock: On [**12-29**], pt had positive blood cultures that was + for [**Female First Name (un) **] with Urine cx showing E.Coli.
A TTE was performed which showed an echodensity and they could not rule out a vegetation.
A TEE did not demonstrate any evidence of vegetation and AV graft showed no evidence of infection.
OB/GYN and ID felt candidemia [**Known firstname **] be secondary to source from fistula, and blood cultures cleared after she was started on micafungin.
Septic Shock 3.
