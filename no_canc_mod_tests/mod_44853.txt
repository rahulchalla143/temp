On EKG he was shown to have 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in V2 and V3 with 1' AV block, no ST changes in I or AVL.
Trop-I = 0.07 and CPK = 0.9.

Selective angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel disease.
Resting hemodynamic measurements revealed mildly elevated left sided filling pressures, with an LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed anteroapical, apical, and inferoapical hypokinesis, with a calculated ejection fraction of 37%.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-7-13**] the T waves are now biphasic in leads II, III and aVF and more prominently inverted in leads I and aVL.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Brief Hospital Course: Left heart catheterization was performed under conscious sedation by percutaneous entry of the right femoral artery.
Coronary angiography was performed in multiple projections with manual contrast injections.
Left ventriculography was performed in the 30 degrees [**Doctor Last Name **] projection, using 36 ml of contrast injected at 12 ml/sec.
An echocardiogram was performed and showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 50%), hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall, but the remaining walls contract well.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

Consider checking LFTs and CK now that pt is on statins for first time.
Baseline LFTs and CK (Ast 26, ALT 19, CK 85) were normal.mild heart failure EF 50% may represent myocardial stunning, consider rechecking in one month
