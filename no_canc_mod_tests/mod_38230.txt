[**2186-3-9**] Cardiac Cath  History of Present Illness: 80 year old male with a history of CHF, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation was admitted to outside hospital with shortness of breath X 3 weeks with exertion and syncope while shoveling snow.
Echocardiogram [**2186-3-8**] showed increase in aortic stenosis, with valve area 0.4cm and an EF of 55%.
He was transferred for cardiac catheterization to evaluate known aortic stensosis and for Coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right atrial pressures, mild pulmonary artery hypertension, and elevated left heart filling pressures with prominant PCW v-waves (23mmHg).
The cardiac output and index were low normal (CO=4L/min, CI=2.2L/min/m2).
The SVR was elevated at 1640 dynes/sec/cm-5.
Simultaneous measurement of femoral artery pressure and left ventricular pressure (mean femoral artery pressure was identical to central aortic pressure on simultaneous measurement) revealed a mean transaortic gradient of 49mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
The maximum gradient through the valve was 29 mm Hg with a mean gradient of 16 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 4.8 liters/minute.
