Due to his age, he was requested to have a stress test which showed abnormal results, including regional wall motion abnormalities, severe hypokinesis in the anterior wall, and apex, and anterolateral central septal walls on the echocardiogram.
Due to the result of this echocardiogram, the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization [**7-23**], showing 90% proximal right coronary artery stenosis, diffuse disease in mid-RCA and 40% distal right coronary artery stenosis, 30% proximal left anterior descending stenoses, 90% mid-LAD stenosis and 60% distal left anterior descending stenosis.
The patient tolerated his procedure well and was doing well after his catheterization until [**2183-11-16**], when he presented with a temperature of 101.0 F., to the Emergency Department with right lower quadrant abdominal pain similar to his diverticulitis which he has had before.
While drinking Baricon contrast in preparation for an abdominal CT scan in the Emergency Department, the patient developed 10 on 10 chest pain while he had no history of chest pain ever in the past, with a [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in leads V3 to V6, [**Street Address(2) 7093**] depressions in leads II, III and AVF.
In the Catheterization Laboratory on [**2183-11-16**], the patient was found to have a cardiac output of 4.3, a pulmonary wedge pressure of 22 and a PA pressure of 42/22.
A study of the patient's coronaries showed mild disease of the left main coronary artery.
He also dropped his oxygen saturation transiently requiring urgent intubation.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit following his catheterization for further care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the Coronary Care Unit, temperature of 98.7 F.; heart rate of 90; blood pressure of 112/56; saturating 100% on 100% FIO2.
Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose and Throat revealed no icterus; the patient had moist mucous membranes.
Chest examination revealed rhonchorous breath sounds in the right anterior chest with decreased breath sounds at the right lung base.
Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen examination revealed a soft abdomen with diffuse normoactive bowel sounds with questionable suprapubic tenderness.
Extremity examination revealed warm extremities with no edema.
LABORATORY:  Studies on admission showed a hematocrit of 39.6, a white count of 9.4, platelet count of 311.
Differential on the white count included 87% neutrophils and 10% bandemia.
Chemistry on admission revealed a sodium of 137, potassium 4.6, chloride of 100, bicarbonate of 27, BUN of 17, creatinine 0.9 and glucose of 139.
Coagulation studies revealed an INR of 1.2, PTT of 31.2.
Initially on admission to the Emergency Department, the patient had a troponin of 5 and first CK was 65.
His hemoglobin A1C was 6 measured in [**2183-9-8**].
His LDL was 50, triglycerides of 115, total cholesterol of 119 and HDL of 46.
A CT scan of his abdomen was not obtained at this time due to the patient's instability for transport.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2183-11-17**], to evaluate the patient's cardiac function post his acute myocardial injury.
He was found to have an ejection fraction of 25 to 30%.
Overall, his left ventricular systolic function was severely depressed.
The patient remained intubated and sedated with intra-aortic balloon pump as well as two pressors for blood pressure support.
On the same date, the patient was noted to have dropped his hematocrit from 39 on presentation to the Emergency Department to 27.9 on the evening of [**2183-11-17**].
The patient's CK in his serum peaked at a total of 1035 on the morning of [**2183-11-18**].
His pressure was now able to tolerate a low dose beta blocker as well as an ACE inhibitor.
His white blood cell count was slowly resolving.
His blood cultures were all negative.
His oxygen saturation improved with gentle diuresis and by [**11-22**], his oxygen saturation was normal at 94% on room air.
On [**11-24**], the patient underwent a repeat echocardiogram.
His right ventricular systolic function was found to be normal.
q. day with an INR check within one week.
