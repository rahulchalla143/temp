Infection less likely as pt remained AF and WBC was not elevated.
CXR with no signs of infiltrate or consolidaton.
CE not elevated and ECG unchanged from baseline lowering suspicion for cardiac etiology.
Blood and urine cultures were no growth to date of discharge.
#Anemia: Uncertain etiology but improved with 2 blood transfusions in the MICU and HCT remained stable.
Guaiac neg in ED and recent colonscopy with only a few polyps found make GI etilogy less likely.
LDH was elevated and haptoglobin less than five however bilirubin was not elevated.
Direct coombs was negative as well, reticulocyte count was appropriately elevated to 3.2.
X-rays of the hip were negative for fluid collection, and CT abdomen was negative for intraabdominal process.
Her HCT stabilized over the next 48hrs and at discharge, her HCT was 25.2.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x3 and patient's ECG was at baseline.
Her home BB and antihypertensives were held in MICU in setting of low BP, but restarted slowly prior to discharge.
Information was obtained from webOMR.

You had multiple blood tests x-rays of your hip and a CT scan of your abdomen which did not show that you were bleeding.
In addition, we tested your stool which did not have blood in it either.
You were given a transfusion of blood and fluids through an IV and we monitored your hemoglobin levels which remained stable.
We stopped your blood pressure medication (Lisinopril) because your blood pressure was low.
