Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with stent placement   History of Present Illness: HPI: 85 yo F h/o unstable angina with multiple past admissions to [**Hospital3 3583**], moderate AS, hypercholesterolemia, past smoker, COPD, CRI, H/O TIA, Dementia, Anemia, AAA, GERD (?
N: grossly non-focal   Pertinent Results: Echo [**9-15**]: Aortic Valve Area: *1.0 cm2 /  EF 50% The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a LEFT dominant system with severe left main CAD.
Hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left heart filling pressures and moderately elevated right heart filling pressures.
The cardiac output and index were preserved.
Assessment of the aortic valve revealed a 15-18mm Hg peak aortic gradient with a a valve area of 1.2cm2, consistent with moderate aortic stenosis.
Left ventriculography was not performed.

At [**Hospital1 18**], patient underwent cardiac catheterization and had stent placement of left main coronary artery.
It is recommended that her blood pressure medications be titrated for target BP of 125/75.
The patient also underwent a TTE, which revealed moderated aortic stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD, 50% ejection fraction.
Cardiac enzymes trended down with a peak CK of 93, 55 on day of discharge.
The patient was noted to have a history of anemia upon admission, and required one unit of PRBCs to maintain a target hematocrit of >30.
In addition, the patient may need to undergo repeat catheterization in [**1-22**] months to evaluate for further disease.
In addition, the patient will need to have her creatinine monitored due to her history of chronic renal insufficiency, and a noted elevation in her creatinine thought to be secondary to insult from catheterization dye.
The patient maintained good urine output throughout hospitalization, and did not require any IVF as she was able to maintain adequate po intake.
Medications on Admission: All: PCN, shellfish, PCN, sulfa, aleve, risperidol On tx - lovenox, IV nitro, Lopressor 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] also, zyprexa, fluoxetine, mirtazapine, lorazepam, albuterol INH  Discharge Medications: 1.
Lisinopril 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): Increase as tolerated for goal blood pressure of 125/75.
Discharge Instructions: We have started you on a new medication called Plavix for your heart disease, you must take this medication and an aspirin every day.
You will need to have your creatinine checked on Tuesday, and will need to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5310**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41415**] within the next two weeks.
You should have your ACE inhibitor increase over the next few months with a target blood pressure of 125/75.
Followup Instructions: You will need to have your creatinine checked no later than Tuesday to evaluate your renal function.
Chest CT done at other hospital revealed nodules (8mm in RLL and 14mm in LLL) in your lungs, the significance of these is unknown, and may need to be followed up with additional imaging.
Because you had a stent placed in your left main coronary artery, you should discuss with your cardiologist about a repeat angiography within 3-6 months to ensure optimal blood flow.
