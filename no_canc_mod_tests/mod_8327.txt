Microbiology: UA - negative Urine Cx - No growth Blood Cx - NGTD Sputum Cx - contaminated Influenza DFA - negative Stool C.diff toxin - negative .
IMAGING: CXR ([**2139-11-22**]) - The patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy wires are intact.
ECG ([**2139-11-22**]) - Sinus tachycardia @ 114bpm.
CXR ([**2139-11-23**]) - Lung volumes are low.
Non-contrast Head CT ([**2139-11-23**]) - No hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION: 1.Compared to prior exam from [**10-24**], [**2138**], there is resolution of subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood.
AXR ([**2139-11-23**]) - There is a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
CXR ([**2139-11-24**]) - In comparison with the study of [**11-23**], there is little overall change.
CXR line placement ([**2139-11-24**]) - Tip of right PICC line terminates in upper right atrium, approximately 2 cm from the cavoatrial junction.
He was started on empiric broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) while in the MICU, with a contaminated sputum culture and blood and urine cultures showing no growth to date.
Urinalysis was clear, chest X-ray was underwhelming, influenza DFA was negative, and stool C.diff toxin was negative as well.
The patient was noted to have unclear abdominal discomfort, but liver function tests and an abdominal X-ray were also unrevealing.
The patient has received 4 days of antibiotics at this point, and will need a total of 14 days of antibiotics.
Although he does have a history of SVT, his ECG showed sinus tachycardia.
h/o SAH - The patient was scheduled to have an outpatient non-contrast Head CT done with follow-up by neurosurgery.
The study was done as an inpatient during this admission, which showed resolution of the sub-arachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood, but persistent ventriculomegaly which was likely secondary to a combination of hydrocephalus and age.
The Neurosurgery team was notified that the Head CT was done, and their recommendations included a Neurology consult to rule-out NPH vs. post-SAH malresorption.
The patient's prophylactic phenytoin was discontinued per Neurosurgery recommendations, given that the SAH and intraventricular blood were resolved on the repeat non-contrast head CT. .
This was likely due to delirium from his infection superimposed on his multi-factorial dementia (Alzheimer's, vascular, [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body), as well as the confounding effect of the sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus noted above.
Given his abdominal discomfort, a bladder scan was done which showed 400cc urine, but he was noted to be urinating spontaneously with good urine output into the condom catheter.
There was felt to be no indication for straight catheterization or placement of a Foley catheter.
Hypothyroidism - The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and was found to have an elevated TSH to 30 and low free T4 of 0.5 on this admission, while in the MICU.
Given that these labs were drawn as an inpatient, and specifically while the patient was in intensive care, the free T4 level is unreliable, and therefore, the TSH may also be elevated beyond the actual current level.
