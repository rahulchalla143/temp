The patient's magnetic resonance imaging was read as having no areas of restricted diffusion consistent with an infarction, but there was mild microvascular changes in the cerebral white matter which were unchanged from his [**2097**] magnetic resonance imaging.
The magnetic resonance angiography of the head had no evidence of significant stenosis with some slight motion artifact.
Otherwise, the patient had an electroencephalogram the following evening which was consistent with mild abnormality in the waking and sleeping states due to bursts of generalized slowing.
The patient had a further neurologic workup including a tensilon test which was stopped secondary to bradycardia; however, an acetylcholine antibody receptor was sent off and was still pending at the time of this dictation.
The patient was to continue to be anticoagulated with a goal INR of 2 to 3 and was to continue Lovenox bridging until he reaches that goal.
The patient's blood pressure remained elevated at times.
The patient's blood pressure regimen was titrated with a heart rate of 60 and was continued on 12.5 mg of metoprolol three times per day but had an increased isosorbide dinitrate regimen of 20 mg three times per day.
Warfarin 1 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube once per day (goal INR of 2 to 3).
