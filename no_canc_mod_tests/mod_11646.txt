The EMS was activated and he was brought to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room for further evaluation.
An emergent CT scan revealed no acute pathology.
The NIH stroke scale was 6.
He was then taken to the MRI Suite and MRI of the brain revealed no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial mass effect.
MR angiography of the cervical vessels revealed decreased flow in the right vertebral artery without any evidence of carotid stenosis.
The MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrated diminished load in the right vertebral artery.
Except for his tingling over his right face and head and generalized weakness, which happened on the [**3-25**], he denies other complaints and his systems were within normal limits.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: GENERAL:  No fatigue, no weight loss, alert and active, oriented, in no active distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 75 per minute, respiratory rate 18 per minute, temperature 97.5 degree Fahrenheit, oxygen saturations 97% on room air.
CHEST:  Bilateral good air entry and clear to auscultation without any wheezes or rales.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Examination revealed normal S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm without any clicks or murmurs.
Pulses were positive in all four extremities with brisk capillary refill.
SENSORY: Sensory examination revealed decreased sensation to pinprick in the left upper extremity, decreased sensation to pinprick in the left lower extremities with intact proprioception.
COORDINATION:  Finger-nose-finger dysmetric on the right side and bilateral knee-to-shin test unsteady.
In the ICU, blood pressures were monitored to autoregulate between 140 to 200 mmHg (systolic).
Since the patient's repeat MRI of the brain with magnetic resonance imaging  of the arteries revealed mild stenosis in the origin of the left carotid artery, tortuosity of the thoracic aorta without MR evidence of significant atheromatous disease and questionable dissection of the right vertebral artery, he was started on anticoagulation with heparin following his transfer to the Neurology Floor on the [**2132-3-31**].
Over the course of that night, heparin infusion rate was decreased to 1,200 units per hour because of PTT levels about 100.
The next day, on the [**2132-4-1**], the INR was 1.4 and the PTT was 108.3.
Today, the patient's PTT on 1200 units per hour of heparin infusion is 96.9 and the INR is 1.8.
Over the course of his stay, at the [**Hospital1 346**] Neurological Intensive Care Unit and the Neurological Service, the patient improved gradually and today, he is able to walk using a walker and the sensory symptoms have improved.
in the evenings, INR goal 2 to 3; Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o.q.d.
blood pressures greater than 200; Ondansetron 4 mg IV q.6.p.r.n.
