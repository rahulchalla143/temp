HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47 year-old female with a history of hypertension, ITP status post splenectomy, and a history of supraventricular tachycardia for which she underwent an electrophysiologic study at [**Hospital1 1444**] [**2155-1-8**].
Her study demonstrated duel pathway physiology and a diseased His-Purkinje system.
The patient had a near syncopal event on the telemetry floor the next day in the setting in which her heart rate decreased from 120 to 60.
The patient had an echocardiogram at that time, which disclosed severe left ventricular dysfunction.
Cardiac MRI confirmed markedly depressed left ventricular function, but failed to show any scarring/infarction, therefore the patient was thought to have not ischemic cardiomyopathy.
The patient underwent CT scan, which demonstrated a large pericardial effusion.
During her time there she developed progressively distended neck veins and hemodynamic instability with systolic blood pressure 60 to 90.
The patient was transported urgently to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.
ITP status post splenectomy, hypertension, history of supraventricular tachycardia status post EP study [**2155-1-8**] with diseased His-Purkinje system.
Echocardiogram [**2155-1-8**] disclosed EF of 25%, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, no pericardial effusion.
Temperature 97.5.
Blood pressure 115/93.
Heart rate 107.
Respiratory rate 24.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 21, hematocrit 33.3.
Differential showed 92.5% neutrophils, 5.2% lymphocytes.
Chemistries were within normal limits with a BUN and creatinine of 13 and 0.7.
INR 1.4.
Initial CK at outside hospital 56, MB less then 0.5, troponin less then 0.05.
Serum tox screen negative.
Urine tox screen negative.
Electrocardiogram sinus tachycardia at 111 beats per minute, normal PR intervals, prolonged QTC, normal axis, left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, T wave inversions in 2, 3 and AVF, V5 and V6, poor R wave progression.
Chest x-ray slight cardiomegaly.
Echocardiogram preliminary read disclosed pericardial effusion greater then 2 cm, left ventricular ejection fraction 25%, total RARV collapse.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Initial right heart catheterization revealed elevated right heart filling pressures with equalization of pressures across the [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
The RA mean pressure was 14 mmHg with an RVEDP and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mmHg.
Initial arterial pressure measured revealed an aortic pressure of 118/72/89 mmHg.
The cardiac output on a Dopamine drip at 2 micrograms per kilogram per minute was preserved at 7.4 meters per minute.
Initially pericardial pressure was found to be 15 mmHg, 350 cc of frankly blood fluid was removed with a subsequent decrease in the mean RA pressure to 8 mmHg, a decrease in the mean pericardial pressure to 3 mmHg and a rise in the arterial blood pressure to 165/84/114 mmHg.
A follow up echocardiogram performed in the catheterization laboratory demonstrated complete resolution of the pericardial effusions.
The patient was also noted to have a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%.
Analysis suggested that the V lead was still present in the RV.
The patient's CT scans from the outside hospital were reviewed.
The following day the patient underwent repeat CT scan of the chest with cardiac gaiting.
Further analysis of the echocardiogram done in the Emergency Department on [**4-19**], however, suggested that the tip of the pacing wire in the right ventricle appeared possibly through the RV free wall.
Pericardial fluid was sent to the laboratory for cytology and culture.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Cultures were unrevealing.
Serum [**Doctor First Name **] was negative.
TSH was within normal limits.
Echocardiogram did not show evidence of recurrent pericardial effusion.
The patient was noted to have drop in hematocrit from low 30s to 23.
The etiology of hematocrit drop was unclear, since echocardiogram did not demonstrate accumulation of pericardial fluid.
Echocardiogram on [**2155-4-25**] disclosed trivial physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with prior study of [**4-24**] there has been no significant change.
The patient will undergo an ETT perfusion study as an outpatient for further evaluation of her cardiomyopathy.
