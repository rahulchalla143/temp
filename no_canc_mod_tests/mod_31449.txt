His wife attempted to feel for a pulse but didn't detect one.
Took ~10-12 minutes before pulse returned.

EKG SR @97, right axis, J point elevation V1-V2 with peaked T's in V2-V3, STD with TWI in II,III,vF with small q's.
Imaging CXR Multifocal consolidations consistent with aspiration versus multifocal pneumonia.
Recommend repeat CT chest after medical treatment of pneumonia in order to rule out malignancy.
CT head diffuse hypodensity of the cerebellum with mass effect on the fourth ventricle and braintem is concerning for stroke.
Repeat CT head:  FINDINGS: There is new global effacement of sulci consistent with global cerebral edema.
Concern for tonsillar herniation is present with crowding at the foramen magnum, not well evaluated on CT given beam hardening artifact in this region.
Improvement of air-fluid levels within the maxillary sinus is noted.
However, evaluation is limited given beam hardening artifact in this region.
there is definitely tonsilar herniation, new since the study of [**2112-11-18**].
CT C spine no fx.

The patient had evidence of anoxic brain injury by CT scan from [**2112-11-18**] and repeat CT of the head on [**2111-11-20**] showed evidence of tonsilar herniation.
His neurological exam showed no brainstem function with no gag, corneal or pupil reflex.
Neurology was consulted and conducted EEG which showed no brain wave activity.
The patient had a recent MICU stay so nosocomial pathogens thought to be possible cause.
Hyperkalemia:  peaked T's resolved on repeat EKG in ICU.
