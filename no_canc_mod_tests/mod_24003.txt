The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
His blood pressure was elevated in the ED - it was noted that the CSF from the EVD had turned bloody - he was brought emergently to the CT scanner which revealed hemorrhage along the track of the right evd as well as a cerebellar AVM with hemorrhage.
His exam slowly improved over the course of the first two post operative days.
CSF was sent and he was switched to Keppra from dilantin for fevers.
His exam remains stable, he follows commands R>L and was [**1-23**] distally in BUE.
All cultures are negative to date, no antibiotics were started.
[**5-23**] EVD was removed and a final CSF culture was sent.
Patient's CXR from [**5-22**] noted to have LLL collapse which was brought up to the SICU team.
Patient's exam remains stable, now on trach mask and was transferred to step down unit.
Head CT after EVD was removed was stable and there for no evidence of hemorrhage.
On [**5-25**] a CXR was obtained which revealed worsening opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm.
Neurological exam remained stable.
On [**5-26**] a medical consult was obtained for concern regarding his CXR and they recommended no antibiotics unless patient had a fever spike of 101.5 or greater along with an elevated WBC.
He should have a CXR again in one weeks time to evaluate his pulmonary status, or sooner if a fever should develop.
