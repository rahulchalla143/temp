ED COURSE:  Systolic blood pressure noted to be 70/40 on admission, received 3 liters normal saline.
Had low grade temperature to 100.7, and was given ceftriaxone for empiric meningitis coverage, but no LP was performed, head CT within normal limits.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 98.2, heart rate 85, blood pressure 145/80, respiratory rate 16, and saturating 97% on room air.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES:  Initial laboratories:  White count 15, 85% neutrophils, 13 lymphocytes, hematocrit 32.5, platelets 269.
Chem-7:  139/4.9/106/24/56/2.4 (baseline noted to approximately 1.4), glucose 90.
Lithium 3.4.
Serum and urine toxicology negative.
Laboratory from [**3-9**]:  White count 7.6.
Chem-7: 142/4.1/110/25/15/1.0, glucose 105.
Lithium 0.4.
EKG on admission:  Sinus bradycardia with normal axis, normal QRS and Q-T, no ischemic changes.
Chest x-ray on admission:  Questionable small left lower lobe infiltrate.
Culture data:  Urine and blood cultures from [**3-4**] with no growth.
Repeat blood and urine from [**3-6**] also with no growth.
RPR was nonreactive.
Head CT [**3-4**]:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Subsequent lithium levels remained within normal limits and no further hemodialysis was required.
Given that she had a nonfocal neurologic examination, a meningitis/encephalitis or stroke as an etiology for delta MS was considered unlikely, therefore lumbar puncture and MRI respectively were considered, but not pursued.
