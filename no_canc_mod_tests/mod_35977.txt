Labs were remarkalbe for Troponin 1.05, CKMB 16.3.
CXR showed no acute process and LENI of LLE revealed no DVT.
ECHO shows trace effusion with no tamponade.
She was initially chest pain free however she developed 5/10 chest pain simliar to presentation and hypoxia to 80's on room air, and hypotension to 80's, she was placed on 6LNC with sats 100%.
Right heart cath showed mean right atrial pressure of 32 and capillary wedge pressure 25mmhg consistent with biventricular failure.
Repeat cardiac cath showed instent rethrombosis at the LAD and a second BMS was placed.
On arrival to the ICU she was intubated on assist control tidal volume 460, rr 22, 100%FiO2, Peep of 5, initial vitals were bp:106/93 p87 on norephinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine.

ECHO ([**2191-7-22**]): There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal and mid anteroseptal,anterior and anterolateral akinesis with basal and mid inferoseptal, inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF<20 %).
Right ventricular pressure and volume overload (causing septal wall flattening) is no longer appreciated.
CXR ([**2191-7-22**]): The presumed TandemHeart catheter extends from the upper abdomen where it passes out of view to the SVC at the level of the azygos insertion.
Brief Hospital Course: A 53 yo F with h/o of CAD s/p IMI ([**2183**], no PCI), CVA, HIV (on HAART, CD4 47, VL ND [**5-/2191**]), HCV, HLD, HTN, who is transferred to the CCU after cardiac cath complicated by biventricular failure hypotension and PEA arrest.
Right heart catheterization showed elevated right atrial pressure and elevated capillary wedge pressure consistent with biventricular failure.
She was placed on ventricular assist device and pressors to maintain mean arterial blood pressure >70.
She became hypotensive with MAPs in the 50s and required additional norepinephrine to maintain her blood pressure.
# Cardiac arrest: Patient suffered cardiac arrest during catheterization secondary to in-stent LAD thrombus and resultant biventricular failure.
On initial presentation to the CCU, she was unresponsive on exam and met criteria for arctic cooling protocol.
Neurology was consulted but was unable to comment on prognosis other than to say that brain stem reflexes were still intact.
