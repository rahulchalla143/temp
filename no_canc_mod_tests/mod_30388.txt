ECG Study Date of [**2133-7-5**]  2:45:08 PM Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-6-9**] P waves are now visible, right bundle-branch block has resolved and the rate has increased somewhat.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2133-7-6**] at 3:43:34 PM There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-6-5**], overall LV systolic function is probably slightly worse.
ECG Study Date of [**2133-7-14**]  2:33:46 PM Atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm with left bundle-branch block pattern.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-7-13**] there is now one hundred percent atrial sensing and ventricular pacing.
# Pump/Acute Congestive heart failure: The patient appeared to have acute on chronic congestive heart failure with EF of 35% on last ECHO from [**5-26**].
Repeat ECHO this admission demonstrated a EF of 25-30%.
He was clinically volume-overloaded on exam and CXR on presentation was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
Given his volume overloaded status, the patient underwent urgent hemodialysis with marked improvement on exam as well as his oxygen requirements.
# Rhythm/Atrial Tachycardia: The patient and was known to have a history of atrial fibrillation with RVR as well as paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, and he presented with a HR of 117.
Post procedure x-ray demonstrated correct lead placement.
His last documented INR prior to discharge was 1.6.
He was also instructed to have his INR followed by the [**Hospital3 **].
A repeat ECHO this admission showed little change in valvular disease.
He was initially started on a Nitro drip for blood pressure control, but this was discontinued following dialysis, which resolved his volume status issues and returned the patient to a normotensive state 130's/50's.
Chest xray was without obvious infiltrate.
Urine analysis/culture were notable only for urine cultures positive for >3 species of bacteria, consistent with contamination.
Blood culture were also negative.
Oxygen Oximeter to monitor O2 saturations at home.
His vital signs are stable.
Please check your INR tomorrow, [**7-17**] and call results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**], office: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 98045**], secretary [**Doctor First Name **]  Please keep all previously scheduled appointments.
