CVP 12-17 so spoke against volume depletion and patient did not lose any blood during procedure per anesthesia.
Hematocrit stable and no evidnece of active bleeding.
CXR without consolidation.
Cardiogenic shock also suspected given recent NSTEMI and known CHF with EF 35%.
No evidence of tamponade on EKG and patient does not have muffled heart sounds or elevated JVD.
TTE showed reduced LVEF 20-25%, no evidence of tamponade.
Blood, sputum cultures with no growth.
Cycled cardiac enzymes to peak.
Also likely component of volume overload seen on cxr and pt has known chf.
EKG unchanged but difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB which is old.
# chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with history of EF 35%.
TTE here showed LVEF 20-25%.
