His CTA showed very generous pulmonary arteries, f/u TTE to evaluate PA pressures was normal.
In addition, head CT negative.
GI bleed: EGD revealed [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear (strange as he didn't have any prior vomiting other than in ambulance), and gastritis.
Hct stable throughout hospital course.
