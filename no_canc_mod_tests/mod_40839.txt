He presented for a relook cardiac catheterization and possible ICD placement since stress testing has revealed new fixed defects and recent Holter monitoring has demonstrated an increase in ventricular ectopy.
At the end of the procedure, the pt was noted to have sbp in 70s with HR 50s and was treated with atropine 0.5 mg IV x3 to treat presumed vagal reaction.
Ventricular ectopy has increased since Holter study dated [**2159-12-13**].
Compared with prior study dated [**11-11**], the severity of the aortic stenosis, MR and pulmonary artery pressure have all increased.
LV systolic function is slightly worse.

From his past history, patient was known to have severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with a recent EF ~20-25% and noted to have a mildly elevated wedge pressure.
He remained on his home diuretic regimen and after his blood pressures normalized, he was resumed on his home dose of ACEi.
GENITOURINARY:  Upon placement of a Foley catheter s/p cardiac catheterization for feeling of bladder fullness, patient had bright red blood, which prompted urology evaluation and subsequent placement of a large bore catheter and chronic foley flushes, to be discontinued 48 hours after passage of blood clots.
Urology recommended initiation of flomax, with recommendation to continue for 30 days and to send for urine cytology when urine is clear yellow, which could not be done as an inpatient since bloody urine was not completely resolved.
