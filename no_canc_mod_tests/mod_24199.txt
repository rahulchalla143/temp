At the time of admission to OSH her laboratory values were: WBC 11.6, lipase [**2137**], amylase 304 and alkaline phosphatase 201.
Her creatinine was within normal limits < 1.
She developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with the heart rate to 150s.
She was fluid resuscitated and taken to the operating room at the outside hospital for an exploratory laparotomy on [**2151-11-5**] where she was found to have leaking cystic duct which was ligated.
An intraoperative cholangiogram was performed at that time and showed a common bile duct stone.
Prior to her transfer her laboratory values were WBC 10.5, hematocrit 26.3, creatinine 0.7.
The day prior [**2151-11-7**]: ALT 24, AST 20, alkaline phosphatase 93.
The administration of the Hurricaine spray led to tachypnea and tachycardia, her O2 saturation dropped to low 80s despite the bagging and she appeared cyanotic.
The arterial blood gas level was indicative of met-hemaglobenemia and patient subsequently received methylene blue.
Her oxygen saturation improved shortly after the administration of the methylene blue.
Past Medical History: - symtomatic cholelithiasis - gallstone pancreatitis - paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the setting of acute illness - s/p laparoscopic cholecystectomy c/b cystic duct leak ([**2151-11-3**]) - s/p exploratory laparotomy, found cystic duct leak - tied off, intraoperative cholangiogram showed CBD stone, JP drain placement ([**2151-11-5**])   Social History: Patient is a single mother of a 6 week old infant.

The administration of the Hurricaine spray led to tachypnea and tachycardia, her O2 saturation dropped to low 80s despite the bagging and she appeared cyanotic.
The arterial blood gas level was indicative of methemoglobenemia and patient subsequently received methylene blue.
Her oxygen saturation improved shortly after the administration of the methylene blue.
On [**11-10**], she was extubated and transferred to the floor, where her JP drain continued to put out increasing amounts of bilious fluid.
She underwent [**Month/Year (2) **] on [**11-10**], which showed no bile leak, and sphincterotomy and stone extraction were performed.
Her JP output then decreased, but increased again several days later, to several hundred cc's per day.
The infectious disease service consulted on this patient on [**11-16**], and a decision was made to stop the vancomycin and continue cipro, flagyl, and add fluconazole given the bile leak.
On [**11-17**], she underwent a repeat MRCP, with official read pending at discharge.
