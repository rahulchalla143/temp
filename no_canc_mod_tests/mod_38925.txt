A CT at [**Hospital6 28728**] Center showed a left frontal SAH.
The patient also had a BP of 220/114 at NSMC.
She received Dilantin and Vitamin K for an INR of 1.2.
She was med flighted here for a neurosurgery evaluation   Past Medical History: PMHx:None PSHX: C-Section  All:PCN   Social History: Social Hx:Pt is [**Name (NI) 16042**] Witness and does not want blood products.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, Handedness Right  On Discharge: A&ox3 PERRL EOMs intact Face symmetrical No pronator drift Motor: full   Pertinent Results: CTA Brain [**2141-11-12**]: Upon review of this study with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], endovascular neuroradiologist, seen on images 55-57, series 3, and on coronal reconstructed image 17, series 401b, is a probable aneurysm, arising from the lateral aspect of the supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery, and directed in an unusual anterolateral long axis.
CXR [**2141-11-12**]: Relatively diminished lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
NCHCT [**2141-11-13**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**2141-11-14**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
CTA [**2141-11-18**]: IMPRESSION:  No significant change in the size of the intracranial arteries allowing for the artifact from the coils.
[**2141-11-19**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-12**] through 10:  Although mediastinal vascular distention is no longer present, pulmonary circulation is engorged, and there is mild edema at the lung bases.
[**2141-11-21**] LENIES:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1140**] was evaluated in the Emergency room, sent for a CTA of the brain which was suspicious for an underlying aneurysm as the cause of her intracranial hemorrhage.
Patient underwent TCDs that showed no vasospasm.
TCDs showed mildly elevated velocities but no vasospasm.
She underwent a CTA to rule out vasospasm after she was found to have a new right pronator drift.
A CTA that was done on [**11-18**] was reported as questionable for left A1 spasm.
Screening lower extremity dopplers were performed and were negative for DVT.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained for elevated blood sugars and the patient was subsequently started on Amaryl [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 9718**] recommendations.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
