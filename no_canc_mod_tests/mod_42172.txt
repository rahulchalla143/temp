In the Emergency Room temperature was 99.7, blood pressure 81/58 with heart rate of 140 that responded with 5 liters of IV fluids to 115/64 with heart rate of 110.
Subsequently her blood pressure dropped to 64/39 with a heart rate of 128 and was started on IV Levophed and transferred to the MICU for continuing care.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Arthritis secondary to Crohn's, chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.5 to 2.1.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.7, heart rate 135, blood pressure 110/80, heart rate 14, O2 saturation 99%, weight 90 kg.
Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Further extremity exam deferred by patient.
LABORATORY DATA:  WBC 13.7 with 86% neutrophils, 0 bands, 8% lymphs, hematocrit 31.7, MCV 79, platelet count 569,000, sodium 134, potassium 4, chloride 96, CO2 21, BUN 13, creatinine 2.4, glucose 124, ALT 10, AST 19, alkaline phosphatase 192, amylase 66, total bilirubin 0.3, calcium 8.8, potassium 6.4, magnesium 1.9.
Urinalysis showed 38 WBC, trace protein, moderate bacteria.
An abdominal, pelvic CT with po contrast showed mucosal thickening at the hepatic and splenic flexures with focal areas of fatty infiltration, no free fluid or lymphadenopathy noted.
Consistent with progression of her Crohn's disease since a prior study of [**2200-6-2**].
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 133 beats per minute with normal axis, poor R wave progression in the anterior leads, flattening and T wave inversions new compared with EKG of [**2200-6-13**].
A GI consult was obtained with the recommendations of continuing her Pentasa and starting a two week course of Cipro and Flagyl.
On hospital day #3 she was taken to the operating room for an examination under anesthesia and excision of skin tag.
Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with profound hypertension to systolic blood pressure of 80's and was started on Levophed.
By hospital day #2 her blood pressure and heart rate responded well such that the Levophed was discontinued.
By hospital day #2 her blood pressure and heart rate were stable and IV fluids were continued only at maintenance levels.
She had several stool studies done throughout the course of her hospital course, however, all stool studies were negative.
Hematologic:  Miss [**Known lastname 3647**] presents to the hospital with hematocrit of 31.7, it fell subsequently over the course of two days to 23.9, however, this was in the setting of several liters of IV fluids and it was felt secondary to dilutional effects from the IV fluids.
On hospital day #2 she received two units of packed red blood cells with appropriate response in her hematocrit to 28.3.
This was felt to be approximately her baseline and her hematocrit was followed through the duration of her hospital course and was stable.
At the time of discharge her hematocrit was 28.9 and stable.
Her baseline creatinine is reportedly 1.5 to 2.0.
At the time of admission her creatinine of 2.4 was felt secondary to profound hypovolemia.
Her creatinine returned to baseline with hydration and at the time of discharge was back to baseline level of 1.4.
