Admission Date:  [**2139-12-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-12-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-8-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: Unstable Angina  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2139-12-8**] Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 4 (Lima to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to Ramus, SVG to PDA) [**2139-12-4**] Cardiac Catheterization  History of Present Illness: 58 y/o male with mulitple cardiac risk factors who presented to outside hosptial with unstable angina/bilateral arm pain.
ECG showed small ST depressions, but was ruled out for an MI.
He then had a stress MIBI which was postive for symptoms and ST depressions.
Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
Cath revealed three vessel coronary artery disease, 80% distal left main stenosis, and 70-80% instent restenosis of the RCA.
Family History: CAD in Sister and Father  Physical Exam: VS: 60 140/80 HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, NC/AT, OP Benign Neck: Supple, FROM, -JVD Lungs: CTAB -w/r/r Heart: RRR, +S1/S2, -c/r/m/g Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS Ext: Warm, well-perfused, 2+ pulses, -Edema Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, Non-focal  Pertinent Results: Cardiac Cath [**2139-12-4**]: 1.
Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system status post RCA stenting.
The LMCA showed a complex 80% distal stenosis with involvement of the LAD and LCX ostia.
The LAD showed a 70% ostial stenosis with 70% stenosis of the D1.
The LCX showed an ostial 80% stenosis with diffuse disease, including a 50% midsegment stenosis.
The RCA showed sequential 80% and 70% instent restenoses within the most proximal RCA stent, with milder 20-30% restenosis of the mid and distal stents.
Echo [**2139-12-7**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Head CT Scan [**2139-12-10**]: There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable, without effacement.
Carotid Ultrasound [**2139-12-11**]: Significant amount of plaque at the origins of the bilateral internal carotid arteries, associated with luminal narrowing estimated between 80 and 99% in diameter on both sides.
EEG [**2139-12-11**]: Abnormal EEG due to the presence of diffuse background slowing and superimposed bursts of generalized mixed frequency delta and theta slowing.
Brain MRI [**2139-12-12**]: The diffusion images demonstrate subtle areas of slow diffusion in the right frontal cortical region with a small area of subcortical acute infarct in the right frontal lobe.

After cardiac catheterizaion - see above results, cardiac surgery was consulted for surgical revascularization.
Patient had usual work-up along with an echocardiogram - see above results.
His creatinine peaked to 2.3 on postoperative day two.
A head CT scan on [**12-10**] showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or of acute territorial infarction.
Carotid ultrasound was notable for bilateral carotid disease, report stating that there was a significant amount of plaque at the origins of the bilateral internal carotid arteries, associated with luminal narrowing estimated between 80 and 99% in diameter on both sides.
An EEG on [**12-11**] was deemed abnormal due to the presence of diffuse background slowing and superimposed bursts of generalized mixed frequency delta and theta slowing.
He was also transfused to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
MRI imaging of the brain on [**12-12**] was notable for findings suggestive of small acute cortical and subcortical infarcts in the right frontal lobe and possibly in the left parietal lobe.
Over several days, his neurological symptoms improved as did his renal function.
At discharge, his BP was 130/70 with a HR in the 80's.
Room air saturations were 99% and all wounds were clean, dry and intact.
Given his carotid disease, his goal SBP was between 120-140 to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion.
