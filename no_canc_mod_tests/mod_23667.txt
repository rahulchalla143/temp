Admission Date:  [**2140-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-8-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-4-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: Unstable angina  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Cardiac catheterization with left circumflex stenting; stenting of dissected obtuse marginal 1 vessel following deployment of left circumflex stent -Transesophageal echocardiogram -Electrocardioversion   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 39008**] is a 68 year old male with history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on the morning of admission for elective catheterization to evaluate intermittent anginal symptoms.
The following morning his wife drove him to [**Hospital3 **], where serial cardiac enzymes were negative.
His EKG did not demonstrate ST changes, however did incidentally demonstrate atrial flutter with variable block and HR 50-110.
He had an echo there which demonstrated a nondilated LV with mild LVH and anterior apical hypokinesis and an EF of 45%.
It was decided to proceed with cardiac catheterization, for which he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Catheterization on the day of admission revealed a flow-limiting stenosis of the left circumflex artery that was stented with a 5.0 DES.
It is presumed that the initial stent partially overlapped the opening of OM1, with dissection and propagation of clot just underneath, occluding the vessel lumen.
Final images demonstrated resumed flow in this vessel.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1) Hypertension with LVH 2) Hyperlipidemia:  Last cholesterol panel [**7-28**] with LDL 73, HDL 31, TC 130.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
It gave off an RV marginal branch that had an 80% stenosis.
The RPLV and RPDA were both widely patent.
Angiography showed occlusion of flow to OM1, which was just distal to newly placed stent.
Symptoms resolved & EKG done just after catheterization was without ST elevations.
The pt underwent TTE which revealed an EF of 45-55% as well as suspected distal septal and inferior hypo to akinesis of the inferior wall.
Warfarin & lovenox initiated post-cardioversion with plan of discontinuing lovenox once INR therapeutic.
Outpatient Lab Work Please place standing order for INR checks every 3-5 days for the next few weeks.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) Unstable angina 2) Dissection of Obtuse Marginal coronary vessel following left circumflex stenting 3) Atrial flutter Secondary: 1) Hypertension with LVH 2) Hyperlipidemia:  Last cholesterol panel [**7-28**] with LDL 73, HDL 31, TC 130.
You will need to give yourself the lovenox injections (as shown) until your INR level is >2.0.
After you reach this therapeutic INR, you will only need to take the coumadin and have regular blood tests with your PCP to monitor INR.
-Please have your blood drawn to check your INR on Monday [**8-22**] with your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
