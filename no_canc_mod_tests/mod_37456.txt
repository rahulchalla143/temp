Admission Date:  [**2131-9-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2131-9-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2055-3-11**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (status post cardiac catheterization in [**2130-12-1**] with stent placement to the circumflex artery and a questionable history of myocardial infarction 25 years ago), hypertension, and chronic atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the CMI Service after and elective catheterization was performed on [**2131-9-4**] due to increasing dyspnea on exertion times one to two weeks and increasing frequency of chest pain.
The cardiac catheterization was complicated by bradycardia which required 0.5 mg of atropine.
Status post catheterization, she was noted to be stable with an initial blood pressure of 144/65 and a heart rate of 60.
Three hours status post catheterization, she was noted to have a decreased blood pressure to 60/40 with a heart rate still in the 60s.
Her hematocrit was found to be 29 (down from 36).
She was given atropine with an increase in heart rate to the 100s.
She was started on a dopamine drip with an increase in blood pressure to the 90s to 110s/60s to 70s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed the patient's vital signs in the Coronary Care Unit revealed initial blood pressure of 77/48, increased to 122/40, heart rate was 96 (in atrial fibrillation), and she was saturating 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric and pale.
Neck examination revealed jugular venous pulsation not appreciated at 30 degrees.
Chest examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally except for coarse upper airway sounds.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a irregular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed the right groin was without hematoma or bruits.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were dopplerable bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed she was alert and oriented times three, enunciating effectively.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories of significance on admission revealed hematocrit fell from 36 to 29 and increased to 32 after 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Complete blood count was within normal limits.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Catheterization in [**2130-8-31**] revealed right coronary artery with 80% proximal circumflex, mild left axis deviation, left circumflex was stented, left middle cerebral artery was normal, pulmonary artery pressures were 31/16, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 17.
Catheterization on [**2131-9-4**] showed first obtuse marginal with 99% which received percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with 20% residual stenosis.
A transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2130-12-1**] showed an ejection fraction of 50% to 60%.
Persantine MIBI in [**2131-5-1**] revealed an ejection fraction of 60% with an apical ischemia, some fixed inferoseptal defects.
Electrocardiogram prior to catheterization revealed atrial fibrillation, heart rate of 54, a Q wave in lead III, early R wave transition.
Electrocardiogram status post catheterization revealed a right bundle-branch block and 1-mm to 2-mm ST depressions in leads V3 to V6, atrial fibrillation at a rate of 125.
Electrocardiogram at [**Street Address(2) 104875**] depressions (less than 1 mm) in leads V3 to V6.
An electrocardiogram at [**Street Address(2) 104876**] changes had resolved.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was felt to be at an increased risk of bleed given that she had just had cardiac catheterization, and her hematocrit had dropped.
A follow-up computed tomography on [**2131-9-6**] showed that the hematoma was stable, so no further action was taken at that time.
The patient had serial hematocrit levels checked.
Her hematocrit levels remained stable afterwards, and she had no signs of further bleeding or infection at her groin site.
Enalapril and beta blocker were started after her blood pressure had stabilized.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and remained negative.
She was placed on Neo-Synephrine and weaned off as her blood pressure tolerated.
Her ejection fraction was 60% (per echocardiogram in [**2130-12-1**]).
A repeat echocardiogram was not done at this time as it was not clinically indicated.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  Her hematocrit had fallen due to an unknown etiology.
A computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed a retroperitoneal hematoma which was stable by follow-up computed tomography.
Vascular Surgery said to follow up with serial hematocrit checks, which stabilized.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  She was started on a cardiac diet, and her electrolytes were repleted as needed.
Her hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable.
Stool studies were sent.
