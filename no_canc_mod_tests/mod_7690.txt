[**2116-11-19**] 9:34 AM  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C CHEST: Note is made of goiter with calcification and multiple small nodules, unchanged since prior study.
In the region of Paget disease, it is difficult to exclude new metastasis, however, otherwise, no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion is noted.
Assessed for adrenal insufficiency (but denies history of steroid use), cardiogenic (but no CP, SOB and EKG reportedly unchanged), allergic (no new medications), hypovolemia [**1-31**] poor intake, blood loss (hct at baseline).
CT evaluation revealed probable pneumonia, and was treated with antibiotics.
Given history of colon ca, found down, and INR 2.4, head CT performed and revealed no evidence of hemorrhage.
Blood cx with 1/4 bottles GPC indicating likely contaminant but given hypotension and fever, started Vancomycin despite minimal bottles being positive.
Speciation of blood cultures consistent with contaminant.
CT findings suggestive of PNA though continued to have minimal symptoms.
Coumadin continued and INR monitored throughout his stay.
Urine lytes sent for confirmation.
CK monitored and downward trending on discharge.
CT torso completed to assess for further metastases, and new lesions were seen.
