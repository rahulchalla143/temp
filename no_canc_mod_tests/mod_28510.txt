The patient had an EEG because of first presentation of global aphasia to rule out seizure (as outside CT scan showed no evidence of stroke).
Her EEg showed no epileptiform activity that would be concerning for seizure but showed some slowing over the area of the infarction site.
Her labs are as following: HgbA1c 6%, LDL 121, HDL 71.
Her suface echocardiogram showed the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, with characteristic rheumatic deformity.
She initially failed her swallow study but on follow-up testing with bedside swallow study and video swallow study, she was cleared for regular diet and thin fluids.
CK checked and was 58 and LFTS nml.
