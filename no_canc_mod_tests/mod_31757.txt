Large right lateral chest wall hematoma, better assessed on subsequent CT. 2.
CTA (chest and abdomen--[**2149-8-6**]): CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Again identified is the large right lateral chest wall hematoma, centered around the right mid to lower intercostal muscles, and extending into the right lateral flank.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The right hepatic lobe 1.4 cm hypoattenuating lesion is unchanged, and may represent a cyst.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Ascites extends into the pelvis, and is slightly higher in attenuation dependently in the lower pelvis.
Degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine are again noted.
Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, intermediate density, right greater than left, with underlying atelectasis.
Cirrhosis with stigmata of portal hypertension  GI bleeding study ([**2149-8-7**]): IMPRESSION: Positive tagged RBC scan demonstrating active bleeding site in the lower right chest.

#right chest wall hematoma with acute blood loss anemia-On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], repeat imaging documented progression of right axillary bleed was performed.
CTA was not diagnostic of source of bleed, so he underwent tagged RBC scan which implicated R T9 intercostal artery bleed, for which pt underwent IR cauterization/embolization on [**8-7**].
CT also showed acute rib fracture which is the likely etiology of injured intercostal artery.
Next, a repeat CT showed ongoing bleeding around [**8-19**] and subsequently he was transferred back to the ICU.
He underwent a repeated IR procedure, which showed generalized oozing, no focal bleeding, and recieved some cauterization of oozing.
He had a HCT drop for the third time around [**8-26**], with CT again suggestive of ongoing bleeding, however Tagged RBC was negative for significant bleeding, thus he was managed symptomatically with transfusions, ffp, amicar to treat the underlying coagulopathy.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable for 5 days.
The patient has had a complete liver workup at [**Hospital1 112**] and his liver disease is likely secondary to EtOH use.
The peritoneal fluid was negative for SBP.
He has an evaluation at [**Hospital3 2358**] for transplant on [**2149-9-30**].
Three days prior to discharge the Amicar was discontinued and the patient's hematocrit remained steady.
With fluid, the creatinine trended to baseline levels.
The patient's creatinine lowered to 0.6 and would raise higher with Lasix doses, likely due to volume depletion.
At discharge, his creatinine was 1.0.
Repeat urine cultures were negative and the patient remained asymptomatic.
End stage liver disease   Discharge Condition: Hematocrit stable at 27.
Throughout your hospital stay, you needed over 30 units of blood to keep your blood count statble.
Over the past 5 days, your blood count has been stable and you have no signs of bleeding.
