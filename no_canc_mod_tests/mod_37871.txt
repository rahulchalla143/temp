The morning of admission the patient had a temperature of 104.0 F and was weaker and incontinent of stool at home.
ED COURSE:  In the ED the patient had a temperature of 101.9 F; pulse of 90; a blood pressure 96/50; respirations at 28; saturating 93 - 95% on room air.
Blood cultures were sent.
Lumbar puncture was performed.
A urinalysis and culture sent as well.
Remarkable for rheumatic heart disease, status post AVR and MVR in [**2146**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  When evaluated by the MICU Team patient's physical exam was as follows.
Patient had a temperature of 105.0 F; pulse of 89, blood pressure was 111/51, breathing at 24, pulse oximetry 99% on two liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Patient had mildly icteric conjunctivae.
Patient's chest exam was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular exam regular rate with mechanical S1, S2, no murmurs were appreciated.
Abdominal exam was remarkable for mild distention but soft and mild diffuse tenderness that did not localize.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  Patient had a white count of 8.5, hematocrit 41.2, platelets of 54, all of these were within baseline for the patient with the exception of his hematocrit which was evaluated from his baseline which is usually in the low 30's.
Chemistries were remarkable for a BUN and creatinine of 31 and 1.8, the 1.8 is elevated from the patient's usual baseline creatinine of 01.0.
Patient's LFTs were elevated with an ALT of 71, and AST of 106, alkaline phosphatase 115, total bilirubin of 2.5, LDH of 493.
Urinalysis was nitrite positive with a trace of protein, glucose and ketone negative.
A small bilirubin, 11 - 20 red blood cells, no white blood cells.
Patient's CSF first tube had 3 white blood cells, 1 red blood cell with a differential of 7 polys, 33 lymphs, 45 monos, protein was 22 and glucose was 80.
Gram stain was negative for PMNs and no microorganisms were noted.
Patient's tox screen was negative and his ammonia level was 24.
Patient had a head CT Scan which showed no acute intracranial processes.
Chest x-ray showed no gross infiltrate or effusions.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed no fluid or abscess throughout the gallbladder.
Patient had multiple blood cultures sent on the day of admission.
Patient's urine culture was also remarkable for growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, however, Infectious Disease Service felt that this was likely a flow over from the blood into the urine.
Patient had a TEE the day after admission which showed no evidence of valvular abscess or endocarditis.
Patient had multiple blood cultures over the course of this hospital stay all of which remained negative after the initially positive blood culture on the 5th.
Patient also had a bone scan to rule out osteomyelitis.
GASTROINTESTINAL - patient had a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis with a history of Grade I and II varices on his previous esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2150**].
However, he had a nasogastric lavage which was unremarkable and which returned only clear fluid.
After initial drop in hematocrit from 41 to the low 30's the patient's hematocrit stabilized in the range of 30 - 31.
Patient had no rebound tenderness, however, because of his profound tenderness a CT Scan was obtained to rule out acute appendicitis.
CT Scan showed no evidence of acute appendicitis but did raise the possibility of diverticulitis thus patient was started levo and Flagyl to treat a presumed diverticulitis.
Patient did have a therapeutic paracentesis during his stay which showed a white blood cell count of 175 and a red blood cell count of 25,000.
The red blood cell count was likely due to traumatic tap.
Additionally patient had a gram stain of his peritoneal fluid which showed no organisms.
HEMATOLOGY - patient had a hematocrit that was stable in the range of 30 - 31 after his initial drop with hydration from 41 - 31.
Following his therapeutic paracentesis, the patient developed a sizable hematoma on his right flank as well as a two point drop in hematocrit.
The patient was thus transfused two units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrits add up appropriately.
Patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout the rest of the course of his admission and his hematoma did not expand further beyond the borders initially marked.
He was somewhat lower at the beginning of his admission thus Heparin flushes were held and a HIT antibody was sent.
His HIT antibody was subsequently found to be nonreactive.
Until such time his diagnostic procedures were finished at which point and time the patient was started back on his Coumadin.
Patient's INR was 4.0 on the day prior to discharge.
The troponin leak resolved once his rate was returned to within normal limits.
Patient responded well to diuresis and had no further signs of failure or shortness of breath once his heart rate was controlled.
RENAL -  patient had a creatinine of 1.8 on admission which improved down to 1.2 with hydration.
His creatinine fluctuated over the course of his hospital stay depending on his fluid status.
At the time of discharge, his creatinine again, was 1.8, this was following a brisk diuresis to relieve his ascites and it was felt that the patient's creatinine would turn back towards the baseline, post diuresis.
Patient would likely benefit from pulmonary function tests in the near future if he has not had them already.
He was initially somnolent with mental status changes and incontinent of urine and stool as he defervesced and was started on antibiotics.
