PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.4 F, blood pressure 134/69, pulse 85, respiratory rate 18.
Patient was intubated with vent settings of pressure support of 5, PEEP of 5, fio2 of 40%, tidal volume 370, O2 saturation 95 to 98%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
LABORATORY:  On admission white count 12.5, hematocrit 40.6, platelets 371.

CPK 128 to 744 to 957.
Troponin I less than 0.3.
CK MB 6.
ALT 248, AST 122, alkaline phosphatase 190, total bilirubin 0.5.
Urinalysis with small blood, more than 300 proteins, 500 glucose, negative nitrate, negative leukocyte esterase, RBCs zero to two, white blood count six to 10, moderate bacteria, epi three to five.
Pleural fluid with white blood cell 50, RBC 10,125, 1+ polys, no organisms grown, total protein 1.9, glucose 132, LDH 768.
Serum tox with no aspirin, no ethanol, no benzodiazepine, barbiturates with tricyclic detected.
Blood cultures pending.
Sputum 2+ gram negative rods.
Urine culture 10 to 100,000 gram positive cocci.
CT Scan of torso with shallow splenic laceration with a small amount of free intraperitoneal fluid in the mesentery with greater attenuation closure to spleen.
CT Scan of head with no intracranial hemorrhage.
Chest x-ray with right sided chest tube, increased lung opacity in left retrocardial region, persistent left pleural effusion.
A repeat chest x-ray was obtained after that which showed no pneumothorax.
This is consistent with the fact that she may have a pneumonia since her sputum was also positive for gram negative rods.
Hematocrit was checked b.i.d.
for her pneumonia and also for her urinary tract infection as her urine was positive for six to 10 white blood cells.
At that time, it was decided that an echo should be done which showed moderate pulmonary hypertension along with right atrial and right ventricular enlargement which are all consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
ENDOCRINOLOGY:  The patient was initially admitted to the outside hospital due to inability to control her sugars and it was mentioned that her sugars were always very elevated in the 200s to 300s.
