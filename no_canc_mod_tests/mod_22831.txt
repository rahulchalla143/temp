There a head CT was performed which showed SAH and SDH.
Following the CT he was intubated for airway protection and trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
He underwent CT of his torso, and X-ray of his right knee per trauma service and he had a CTA of the head to rule out vascular injury at our request.

------------------ CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2173-5-26**] 1.Bilateral subsegmental atelectasis as described above.
CTA [**2173-5-26**]: No dissection, aneurysm, or AVM detected.
-------------------- Repeat NCHCT [**2173-5-26**]: stable appearance ------------------ CT Head [**5-29**] 1.
----------------- Lumbar xrays [**2173-5-30**]: No radiographic evidence of acute lumbar spine fracture CT Head [**5-31**]  1.
----------------- EEG [**2173-6-2**]: This is an abnormal routine EEG, due to the presence of a significant portion of the record spent in sleep and mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
-------------- MRI brain [**2173-6-4**]: 1.
Right vertex, pericallosal, and temporal contusion injuries, as seen on the prior CT examination CXR [**2173-6-4**]: Feeding tube passes to the mid stomach and out of view.
Lung volumes are low,but there is no pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
CXR [**2173-6-6**]: Low inspiratory volumes with patchy retrocardiac and left suprahilar opacity, ?due to atelectasis.

He was in a hard collar which was removed by the ICU team for a negative cervical CT done at [**Hospital6 **].
Serial imaging of the head was ontained on [**5-28**] and [**5-29**] which showed improvement of his SAH and stable SDH.
X-ray of the lumbar and sacral spine were obtained which showed no acute fracture.
His exam remained stable and he was transferred to the neuro stepdown unit.
An MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine was attempted but patient was unable to tolerate the study without significant sedation that would have required intubation.
His WBC count increased on [**6-1**] to 16.8 and a urinalysis was obtained which was negative.
His sodium which was slowly decreasing was followed closely and maintained within normal levels through tube feedings and free water bolus adjustments.
The also suggested EEG which was obtained and results showed early diffuse encephalopathy and no epileptiform activity.
He was also intubated in order to obtain MRI of the brain which showed diffuse axonal injury; MRI of spine was considered but not done as pt was moving all extremities with no motor deficits and the information to be gained from doing this study would not change current management.
He had high WBC that was slowly decreasing and all fever work up including cultures were negative.
WBC [**6-8**] was 16.1.
Blood glucoses were mildly elevated throughout his hospitalization but better controlled once on tube feedings and resumed usual home meds.
Prolonged QT was found on EKG and haldol was discontinued.
You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
