The patient had a biopsy prior to admission that showed fibrosis consistent with ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient presented to the hospital for a renal angiogram of the transplanted kidney and possible stent.
Angiogram was performed on [**2166-10-29**] that showed virtuosity of the proximal renal artery with focal moderate stenosis centrally and 35 mmHg systolic gradient.
Post stent arteriogram showed intimal flap of large second order vessel consistent with flow-limiting dissection distal to the stent.
A renal ultrasound on postoperative day number one showed good perfusion of the kidney.
Serial creatinine levels were measured and showed a gradual increase consistent with nonoliguric ATN.
The patient's creatinine has been followed serially throughout the days.
His creatinine on admission was 2.6 and increased on postoperative day number one to 4.5 slowly plateauing at 7.8 on discharge, postoperative day number five.
The vital signs were stable.
