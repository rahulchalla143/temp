Initial imaging showed stable pseduocysts slightly improved in size and pt was initially managed with pain control and IVF.
The pt had a repeat Abd CT [**2118-12-25**] with new enlarging cyst roughly 5cm.
MRI was done which showed e/o chronic inflammation and narrowing of pancreatic duct (no comment biliary pathology but was not an MRCP).
OSH discussed case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who requested patient be transferred for further evaluation and consideration of J-tube placement if symptoms persist.
Of note, the patient had occasional fevers (Tm 101.5) during the hospitalization at OSH, and had a urine culture that grew 80,000 Ecoli (pansensitive) from [**2118-12-18**] that was not treated as the pt was considered "asymptomatic."
Constipation for ~1 week.

ERCP performed EGD and noted significant amounts of blood, no active bleed and likely external compression by a pseudocyst, which was eroding into the pylorus/duodenum.
The following day, repeat EGD showed stable mass, 2 AVMs (duodenum and stomach) that were thermally treated and no clear treatable source of bleeding.
Her second night in the ICU, she again began bleeding >1.5 liters bright red blood from above and below.
-Fever/leukocytosis - The patient has been afebrile at [**Hospital1 18**] but with persistent and worsening leukocytosis.
