Admission Date:  [**2194-1-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-1-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-5-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Bactrim / Cozaar / Captopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**] Chief Complaint: s/p fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. right-sided thoracentesis [**2194-1-3**] 2. left-sided thoracentesis [**2194-1-4**] 3. right chest tube placement [**2194-1-6**] 4. right subclavian CVL [**2194-1-6**], replaced [**2194-1-12**] 5. trach/PEG [**2194-1-10**]  History of Present Illness: 77F s/p fall from standing; initially seen at OSH; she reportedly became agitated when a c-collar was placed, and required sedation, and was subsequently intubated for respiratory distress.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Her injuries noted were a C7 fracture, and chronic-appearing bilateral pleural effusions.
CHF 2.
NHL 5.
?radiation treatment to thyroid  Pertinent Results: [**2194-1-1**] CT cspine: 1.
Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectatic changes are better assessed on corresponding CT torso performed concurrently."
A spine consult was obtained and recommended that she remain in the collar until they would be able to examine her clinically (off sedation).
An MR was also obtained.
A geriatrics consult was obtained -- her nighttime agitation was subsequently managed with Seroquel 25mg QHS.
CV: An ECHO on [**1-2**] did not demonstrate significant cardiac abnormalities.
It was thought that her pleural effusions may have contributed to her respiratory compromise, and she had a right and left-sided thoracentesis on Hd #3 and 4 (respectively).
A CVL was also placed at this time -- on imaging, she was noted to have persistent right pleural effusion and a small apical pneumothorax.
Pleural fluid analyses demonstrated a transudative fluid, which was not infected.
On bronchoscopy, close evaluation demonstrated upper airway edema, with no leak when the cuff was down.
She had her trach/PEG on [**2194-1-10**].
On [**1-11**] she had a episode of desaturation to the 80s for which she underwent another bronchoscopy that revealed thick brown sputum.
She was placed on Vancomycin and Zosyn empirically until sputum cultures and BAL returned negative.
Stool cultures x 2 were sent and found to be negative.
Labs drawn at the time showed WBC = 29.
Blood cultures were still negative at 4 days out.
