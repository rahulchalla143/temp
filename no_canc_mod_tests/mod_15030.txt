In the outside hospital Emergency Department, patient was found afebrile and hemodynamically stable with positive serum and urine ketones (ABG 7.21/23/86/95% on room air), anion gap 34, normal serum glucose, and negative serum toxin screen except for salicylates.
The patient was treated with 2 liters of normal saline without significant change in his blood pH, which was subsequently changed to normal saline with 5 amps of sodium bicarb.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
Per the patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was found at the time of presentation to have an anion gap of 23 with a bicarb of 16 and ketonuria.
The patient's liver function tests were elevated with an AST of 354, ALT of 104, GTT 154, and total bilirubin of 1.2.
Patient's LDH at the time was 340 with CKs greater than 600.
A subsequent Gastroenterology workup for his elevated liver function tests included a right upper quadrant ultrasound, as well as blood work evaluating possible infectious, toxic, or immunologic causes.
Per the patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] workup was essentially negative, and the primary care physician was recommended to followup with a repeat CK at a later date for evaluation for possible primary muscular abnormality.
However, the patient remained asymptomatic without further exacerbations of his aforementioned abnormalities, and no further workup was done.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.8, heart rate 127, blood pressure 133/77, respiratory rate 35, oxygen saturation 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Gait deferred, cerebellar intact, finger-to-nose and rapid-alternating movements.
LABORATORIES AND STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  At [**Hospital6 48670**]:  Complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 13.3, hematocrit 40.2, MCV 104, and platelets of 183 with a white blood cell differential of 89% polys, 4% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes.
Chem-7 with a sodium of 137, potassium 4.9, chloride 92, bicarb 11, BUN 23, creatinine 1.2, and glucose of 72.
Serum tox screen is notable for a salicylate level of 4.5, Tylenol less than 10, otherwise negative.
Large serum acetone was measured.
Arterial blood gas at the outside hospital:  7.21/23/86 with 95% on room air.
Initial CK of 2,543 with a negative MB index of 0.9, lactic acid 2.3, TSH 0.36 and urinalysis with greater than 80 ketones.
Initial blood work at [**Hospital1 69**]: Chem-7 with a sodium of 134, potassium 6.9, chloride 96, bicarb 10, BUN 19, creatinine 1.2, and glucose of 105 (notable for a gross hemolysis).
AST 393, ALT 173, LDH 1,309.
CK 3,704, alkaline phosphatase 48, amylase 27, total bilirubin 0.9, albumin 4.4, calcium 8.0, magnesium 1.1, and phosphorus 3.7.
Calculated serum OSM was 295.
Serial laboratories were notable for a persistent anion gap acidosis, mild transaminitis, AST greater than ALT, uptrending creatinine kinase to greater than 4,000, macrocytosis, and persistent large blood acetone.
Patient's creatinine kinase continued to rise with a peak CK of 6,435.
The trend in liver function tests paralleled the patient's CKs with a peak ALT of 417, AST 1,230, LDH 2,670, with normal total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
A Neurology consult was obtained on [**5-22**] for evaluation of potential metabolic myopathy.
The Neurology evaluation revealed an essentially negative neurologic examination except for mildly decreased muscle strength ([**4-21**]) in the patient's deltoids bilaterally.
The differential diagnosis for myopathy includes metabolic causes such as lipid metabolism, glycolytic and/or glyconeolytic causes, and/or mitochondrial defects, post-viral causes such as EBV, HSV, HIV, etc, or inflammatory myopathy such as polymyositis, or vasculitis.
The blood work was sent, however, the EMG was not obtained secondary to scheduling.
All blood work is pending at the time of dictation.
Although it was felt that the elevated CK and LFT abnormalities were most likely secondary to primary muscle source, hepatitis serologies including hepatitis A, B, C, as well as EBV and CMV serologies were obtained.
All serologies are negative at the time of dictation.
INSTRUCTIONS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged to home and instructed to followup with his primary care physician in two days postdischarge for followup blood work.
Metabolic abnormalities, with anion gap acidosis, elevated CK, and transaminitis of unclear etiology undergoing workup for possible metabolic myopathy.
