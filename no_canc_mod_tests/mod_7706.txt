He went to an OSH where CT showed an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Sensation: Intact to light touch bilaterally.

FINDINGS: Evaluation of the above vessels demonstrates no evidence of aneurysm, significant stenosis, or arteriovenous malformation.
LUMBAR SPINE: FINDINGS: From L1-2 to L4-5 mild degenerative changes seen.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2132-6-6**] The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2132-6-4**] COMPARISON: Multiple priors, the most recent a CT head dated [**2132-5-29**].
CT HEAD: There has been resolution of previously noted high-density material within the prepontine cistern extending into the interpeduncular fossa.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 30845**] was admitted to the SICU for close neurological observation, his SBP was kept strictly less than 140, he was started on Nimodipine.
He had a cerebral angiogram that did not show any evidence of an anuersym or malformation.
On [**5-27**] he underwent a second cerebral angiogram which showed no aneurysm.
His levels returned to [**Location 213**] prior to discharge and he no longer required salt tablets.
Blood cultures from [**5-28**] grew coag + staph aureus.
The swab from the a-line site grew out coag + staph aureus as well (MSSA).
He had a transcranial doppler which showed slightly increased velocity, inconclusive vasospasm (doppler measure: bilat MCA ave. 100, no ICA measurement).
His fevers came down and he had no evidence of vasospasm, so he was tranferred to the step-down unit on [**5-31**].
On [**6-3**] he had an MRI of the spine which showed no evidence of a vascular abnormality.
His CTA on [**6-4**] showed resolution of SAH, patent circle of [**Location (un) **], no vasospasm.
Infectious Disease Service was consulted on [**6-5**] to determine when the vancomycin can be stopped and they recommended repeat blood cultures which showed no growth at time of discharge.
Echocardiogram revealed preserved LVEF, no valvular vegetations, and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
