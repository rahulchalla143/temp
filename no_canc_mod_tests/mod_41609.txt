Workup demonstrated liver failure with poor synthetic function including INR of 2.9 and albumin 1.5, additionally she had thrombocytopenia and hyponatremia.
GI workup was negative for clostridium difficile and the likely culprit for her abdominal distension, in addition to the ascites, was felt to be a distal obstruction syndrome.
Reportedly she recieved two units of blood for a low hematocrit, did not have evidence of active bleeding, and was discharged on [**2181-8-1**] after a transjugular liver biopsy demonstrated biliary fibrosis/cirrhosis.
She was readmitted on [**2181-8-14**] with jaundice/anasarca and underwent diagnostic and therapeutic paracenteses with 4.5L of thin fluid removed, negative for SBP.
Since arriving here, her transplantation evaluation has proceeded expeditiously on the hepatology service.
On initial examination she is resting comfortably with no immediate complaints.
Based on her current labs she is Child's C/MELD 38.2.

On the floor, her condition deteriorated and her Acute Kidney Injury worsened, thought to be due to Hepatic Renal Syndrome (UNa<10).
Due to her worsening Cr, she was to undergo dialysis as a bridge to transplant, and thought not to be able to maintain pressures during hemodialysis so she had to go to the ICU to for CVVH.
SICU Course:  [**8-26**]: lactulose titrated down from q2 to q6 after 1800+ stool output during first part of day, mental status remained clear, CVVH 100cc/hr, BP stable, repeat blood cx sent [**8-27**]: CVVHDF goal 3000cc/24hrs.
Hct 22.9, transfused 2u pRBCs.
[**8-29**]: TTE revealed elevated PA pressures.
small left apical pneumothorax appreciated on CXR but did not appear to be clinically relevant.
Pressor requirement increased, levo/vaso were started given septic shock secondary to pneumonia, neo was weaned off.
[**8-31**]: Repeat CXR secondary to asynchrony tachypnea on vent, relatively unchanged.
1645, Bloody output noted from NGT, lavage, she was transfused 1 uPRBCs, 1 u cryo.
PO2 69 on FiO2 50%, PEEP 10 inc to 60% and 12 repeat ABG [**9-1**]: Switched to ambisone from micafungin for better fungal.
