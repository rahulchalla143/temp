She underwent a colonoscopy which showed bleeding at the polypectomy site and 3 clips were placed and epi injected at the site.
Pt stabilized and was transferred back to the floor where her Hct remained stable.
After her colonoscopy and subsequent transfer to the general medicine floor, she was restarted on coumadin with a heparin drip, which was later transitioned to lovenox for discharge.
She did not notice any further blood in her stool and was discharged on lovenox and her usual home coumadin regimen with plans to follow up at her usual coumadin clinic for an INR check the day after discharge.
Although her nausea was most likely due to movi-prep intake, she was ruled out for MI with CE, which were neg times two, and repeat EKG which also showed RBBB and was unchanged.
You were admitted to the ICU and your blood counts were low so you received 3 units of blood.
You had a colonoscopy which showed bleeding from the site of your polypectomy, so clips were put in to stop the bleeding.
Your blood counts remained stable after that and you were transferred to the general medicine floor, where you were restarted on your lovenox and coumadin.
You should get your INR checked tomorrow.
Please continue lovenox 60mg subcutaneously twice a day as well as your usual coumadin dosing and follow up at your usual coumadin clinic for INR checks.
Please have your INR checked tomorrow and adjust your lovenox and coumadin as directed.
