MICROBIOLOGY: [**2115-4-24**] 11:40 am BLOOD CULTURES x2:                             **FINAL REPORT [**2115-4-28**]**    Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2115-4-28**]):       STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
**FINAL REPORT [**2115-4-26**]**    WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2115-4-26**]):       STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
**FINAL REPORT [**2115-4-26**]**    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2115-4-26**]):       Culture workup discontinued.
Further incubation showed contamination       with mixed fecal flora.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-4-6**] the heart rate is increased.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-23**], the septal tricuspid leaflet thickening and tricuspid regurgitation is increased.
[**2115-4-25**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): In comparison to the prior radiograph, there has been little significant overall change.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-23**], the septal tricuspid leaflet thickening and tricuspid regurgitation is increased.
UA revealed 8 WBCs but was otherwise unremarkable.
CXR revealed a chronically elevated left hemidiaphragm but no clear infiltrate.
Blood cultures ultimately revealed MRSA bacteremia.
Urine culture eventually revealed 10K-100K GNRs but was contaminated so Meropenem was discontinued.
Catheter tip culture also grew MRSA.
TEE for further evaluation was not pursued, as the decision was made to treat with vancomycin IV for 6 weeks empirically.
The patient's blood pressure slowly trended down from systolics of 120s to 80s.
His blood pressure then slowly improved at which time he was transferred to the floor.
Dialysis was not performed during his ICU stay due to removal of the HD line and tenuous blood pressures.
He initially required fluid boluses for hypotension but his fluid balance was subsequently managed with Lasix boluses.
Patient required several units of FFP and doses of vitamin K to reverse INR enough for placement of a permanent HD catheter, which was done on [**2115-5-3**].
# Anemia: Hematocrit was 30.6 on admission, down from 33.5 on [**2115-4-12**].
His hematocrit remained stable for the rest of his admission.
On evaluation by our inpatient Psychiatry team, they recommended no changes to his complex psychiatric medication regimen, since he is so stable at this time.
# Pulmonary Embolism on Coumadin: He presented with INR of 4.0 and Coumadin was held.
For permanent HD line placement, desired INR was less than 1.5.
On discharge his latest INR is 1.1, he will be continued on home regimen of 3mg daily, with INR to be checked by rehab and titrated for INR goal of [**2-8**].
Patient should have labs checked weekly while on this antibiotic: CBC with differential, BUN/Cr, AST/ALT, Alk Phos, Total bili, ESR/CRP, vancomycin level.
You will have weekly labs checked at [**Hospital3 2558**].
