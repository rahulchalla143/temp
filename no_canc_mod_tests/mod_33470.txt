Compared to the previous tracing the rate is slower and atrial ectopy is new.
CXR [**2190-10-30**]: 1.
Small Bilateral Pleural Effusions  EEG [**2190-11-2**]: Resultings Pending  Femur Xray (left) [**2190-11-3**]: No fracture or focal bone lesion detected involving the left femur.
MRI Head w and w/o contrast [**2190-11-3**]: A few scattered areas of high signal intensity identified at the  subcortical and periventricular white matter, likely consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
After the administration of gadolinium contrast, there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement.
MICROBIOLOGY  [**2190-10-30**] - [**Year (4 digits) **] Cultures NGTD [**2190-10-30**] - Urine Cultures NGTD [**2190-10-31**] - MRSA negative [**2190-10-31**] - Influenza A/B - negative     Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 76883**] is a 77 year old woman with a history of chronic pulmonary fibrosis on chronic prednisone therapy who has had a significant functional decline since [**2190-5-17**] when she underwent an abdominal surgery to correct a colocovescicular fistula that presented four day ago to the ED with unresponsiveness.
Vital signs were within normal limits.
[**Year (4 digits) **] glucose was 102.
ABG was 7.42/52/65.
The neurology service felt that he patient's intermittent unresponsiveness improved with naltrexone was clearly medication-related, with no need for repeat head CT and no concern for seizure activity, with no need to continue Keppra.
A repeat MRI was unremarkable.
An EEG was done consistent with diffuse slowing without epileptiform activity.
* Pneumonia: CXR showed multifocal pneumonia.
She should have a follow up chest radiograph in [**3-22**] weeks to document resolution of her pneumonia.
A radiograph was done that showed no evidence of a fracture.
Exam was unremarkable.
Pain was belived to be sciatic in nature.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a week.
Calcium 500 With D 500 mg(1,250mg) -400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
Several tests were done and no cardiac or neurological etiology of your episodes was found.
A radiograph was done that showed no evidence of a fracture.
