Ultrasound showed evidence of cholecystitis, thickened GB, moderate GB thickening with son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign; he also had [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign on examination.
He subsequently became febrile, rigored and was diaphoretic, tachycardia (130s), and hypertensive (SBP 200s).
His blood pressure dropped to SBP 70 and a STAT lactate increased to  2.5-->2.7, sepsis protocol was instituted and he was transferred back to the ICU.
While in the unit, he was aggressively volume resuscitated, but he did not require pressors as his BP was fluid responsive; he was positive 10L/first 24 hours in unit.
His blood pressure stabilized.
Per report, urine culture from [**Hospital1 **] shows pansensitive E. coli.
All cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] are negative to date.
Amylase and lipase were negative currently, though the patient was thought to have evidence of mild post-ERCP pancreatitis.
BPH 5.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2121-1-3**] Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size allowing for enlarged pericardial fat pads as shown on recent CT abdomen study of [**2120-12-31**].
TTE (Complete) [**2121-1-3**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
OSH urine cultures had shown pan-sensitive E. Coli one week prior to admission.
The patient had been treated with antibiotics prior to admission; this had likely cleared prior to presentation as (1) E. Coli was pan-sensitive, (2) UTI was uncomplicated and easily treated with more than 3 days of a quinolone and (3)all urinalysis and urine cultures were negative on this admission.
There was no evidence of cholangitis on ERCP; however, a diagnosis of cholangitis unclear as patient's total bilirubin decreased with biliary stent placement.
Cholecystitis was diagnosed by review of prior RUQ ultrasound showing gallbladder wall thickening, prior CT scan showing pericholecystic fluid, and positive son[**Name (NI) 493**] and physical examination [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.
The time course was not typical for HIT; he was HIT antibody negative [**2121-1-1**].
