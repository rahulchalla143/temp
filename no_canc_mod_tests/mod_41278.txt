PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram on admission revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 83 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, poor R wave progression, and nonspecific ST-T wave changes in the inferior and lateral leads.
A chest x-ray on admission revealed mild congestive heart failure with a small right pleural effusion.
Left hip films revealed an intertrochanteric fracture of the left proximal femur was seen.
Per the Orthopaedic team recommendations, the goal INR was set at 1.5 to 2.
Upon transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was weaned from the phenylephrine drip, and his blood pressure returned to his baseline with intravenous fluids.
Fluid boluses were given to maintain his urine output.
He received an additional unit of blood during his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay on [**1-9**] and another unit on [**1-12**] for a hematocrit of less than 28.
His INR became markedly elevated above 5.
Coumadin was held for the remainder of his hospital stay, and his INR trended down toward the goal of 1.5 to 2.
Urine cultures and blood cultures showed no growth.
A chest x-ray showed no infiltrate.
A urinalysis was negative.
His white blood cell count trended downward throughout his hospital stay.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient required intravenous fluids to maintain his urine output at greater than 20 cc to 30 cc per hour.
The patient was eventually weaned to room air where he did have adequate oxygen saturations in the low 90s.
Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth twice per day (hold for a systolic blood pressure of less than 100 or a heart rate of less 60).
Warfarin 1 mg by mouth at hour of sleep (to be started n [**1-13**] with INR monitoring daily and dose adjustment by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1266**] or in house physician; with a goal INR of 1.5 to 2).
