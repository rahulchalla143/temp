In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.5 P: 88 BP: 148/90 R: 16 O2 sat 88% on RA.
Initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 83, left axis deviation, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in I, V5, TWF in III, q wave in I, aVL (old).
Repeat EKG without ST depressions.
She had a CXR which showed no acute cardiopulmonary process and she had one set of negative cardiac enzymes.
On arrival to the ICU she currently denies fevers, chills, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea.
Family History: No family history of gastrointestinal bleeding   Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 96.5 BP: 163/73 P: 73 R: 19 O2: 100% on 2L General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Coarse breath sounds bilaterally, scarce expiratory wheezes throughout, no rales or CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, II/VI SEM at LUSB non-radiating, no rubs or gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Rectal: Per ER gross blood in rectal vault   Pertinent Results: [**2127-5-26**]: CBC 7.0 > 10.8/32.4 < 345 PT-11.8 PTT-24.5 INR(PT)-1.0 Glucose-103 UreaN-35* Creat-3.4* Na-139 K-3.8 Cl-107 HCO3-20* AnGap-16 Albumin-3.7 Calcium-8.4 Phos-4.2 Mg-2.4 ALT-6 AST-11  AlkPhos-107 TotBili-0.3  Cardiac Enzymes: negative  [**2127-5-26**]: Tagged RBC scan: No evidence of active GI bleeding.
Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Patient was admitted with blood in the rectal vault on exam in ED with three bloody bowel movements since.
She continued to have BRBPR overnight in the ICU and a red blood cell scan was ordered but did not show active bleeding.
Hematocrit was stable after receiving two units PRBCs.
Cardiac enzymes remained negative.
The patient's GI bleeding resolved and her hematocrit stabilized at 31-33.
GI was consulted but felt that another colonoscopy at this time was not indicated given the patient's recent colonoscopy in [**2126-8-28**] showing diverticuli.
ST Depressions: Patient presented with admission EKG with poor baseline tracing but possible small abnormalities; these resolved on subsequent EKG and ICU admission EKG and were likely due to demand ischemia.
BP remained high but stable and low-dose, short-acting diltiazem was restarted gradually, at 30 QID then 60 QID and eventually at the equivalent of her home dose of 90 QID; then sent out on her home dose of long-acting diltiazem.
Medications were renally dosed, and creatinine was followed.
