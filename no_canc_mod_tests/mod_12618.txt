An echocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45% with mitral regurgitation 2 to 3+ as well as inferior, posterior hypokinesis.
He had computerized tomographic angiography which demonstrated no pulmonary embolus.
Dobutamine stress demonstrated large anterior apical inferior, posterior and lateral reversible defects.
Chest x-ray also done at the outside hospital showed right middle lobe infiltrates.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination at the time of admission revealed vital signs with heartrate of 74, blood pressure 134/67, respiratory rate 18.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils equally round and reactive to light.
Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data at the time of transfer revealed white count 8.2, hematocrit 34.2, platelets 195, sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 101, carbon dioxide 32, BUN 18, creatinine 1.3, glucose 118, CPK prior to admission on [**462-12-13**], on [**413-12-14**], on [**394-12-17**] and on [**394-12-19**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, please see catheterization report or full details.
Following his complaint of abdominal pain he had decreasing level of consciousness followed by a cardiac arrest during which he had periods of asystole, lasting six to eight seconds.
At the time of transfer, the patient's mean arterial pressure was 70, central venous pressure was 12, he was ventricularly paced at a rate of 70.
He remained on his Neosynephrine infusion to keep his mean arterial pressure greater than 70.
The catheterization showed his left anterior descending to have an 80% occlusion with competitive flow distally, circumflex and obtuse marginal 1 to be 80% occluded and the right coronary artery to be 100% occluded with proximal filling via left to right collaterals.
Following the catheterization and stenting the patient was transferred from the Catheterization Laboratory to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
He continued to be followed by the Electrophysiology Service and on postoperative day #10 he was brought to the Electrophysiology Suite where he underwent electrophysiology studies and automatic implanted cardioverter defibrillator placement.
At the time of transfer to rehabilitation, the patient's physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs temperature 97.7, heartrate 67, ventricularly paced, blood pressure 145/70, respiratory rate 18 and oxygen saturation 99% on 3 liters.
Weight preoperatively is 125 kg, at discharge is 121.8 kg.
Laboratory data on the day of discharge is white count 9.5, hematocrit 28.7, platelets 273, PT 14, PTT 28.7, INR 1.4.
Sodium 141, potassium 4.6, chloride 102, carbon dioxide 31, BUN 24, creatinine 1.1, glucose 100.
On physical examination he is alert and oriented times three, moves all extremities and is conversant.
He had bilateral groin ultrasounds which were negative for pseudoaneurysm.
Coumadin to attain a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5, he has received 5 mg of Coumadin on [**1-9**] as well as will receive 5 mg on [**1-10**].
