Admission Date:  [**2116-12-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-1-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2046-3-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5644**] Chief Complaint: Transferred from OSH with thoracic aortic aneurysm by CT scan.
Transesophageal echocardiogram  History of Present Illness:    70-year-old man w/ mult medical problems including DM2, HTN, CAD s/p CABG presented to OSH on [**2116-12-21**] w/ 1 week of epigastric pain radiating to the back.
OSH CT revealed 4.5cm thoracic aortic aneurysm [**Company 5249**]-10 level, w/ possible dissection and leaking.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further rx on [**2116-12-21**], received endovascular aortic aneurysm repair on [**12-22**]/5 during which he lost 2500cc blood and received 10units PRBCs.
He was then admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
CHF: ECHO [**2115-12-30**] w/ severely depressed EF, basal akinesis, [**12-20**]+ MR  8.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
CXR ([**2116-12-29**]):  Mild CHF may be improved compared to [**2116-12-26**].
Otherwise, unchanged exam with stable cardiomegaly and retrocardiac opacity.
UE doppler US:  [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] examination of the left upper extremity venous system was performed.
The left ventricular systolic function is moderately to severely depressed.There is significant calcification in the aortic arch.
No abscess is seen around the graft, however CT scan or MRI would be a more accurate test to rule out the diagnosis.
CT abdomen ([**2117-1-8**]):   1) Small left inguinal fluid collection with surrounding fat stranding.
Thoracic aortic aneurysm:  he was transferred from OSH on [**2116-12-21**] for treatment of T10-level aortic aneurysm discovered on CT scan.
He was treated w/ heparin gtt after his surgery for anticoagulation; meanwhile, he was started on coumadin therapy for a goal INR of [**1-21**].
When goal INR was achieved, heparin gtt was d/c and he was continued on coumadin.
Blood cultures were drawn, and grew MRSA.
Surveillance cultures on [**12-14**], and [**1-5**] grew MRSA despite continuing vancomycin treatment, raising concern for possible bacterial seeding of cardiac valves or vascular graft.
He was evaluated w/ TEE, which showed no evidence of endocarditis, and w/ abdominal CT, which showed no evidence of vascular graft infection.
ID service was consulted, and believed that positive surveillance cultures were most likely [**1-20**] infected left IJ thrombus w/ intermittent bacterial showering.
The pt has been afebrile for nearly 2 weeks, and surveillance cultures from [**2117-1-5**] to [**2117-1-8**] show no growth.
Cardiology and EP services were consulted, and it was thought that NSVT was most likely [**1-20**] cardiac scarring from previous MI.
C. diff colitis:  he developed diarrhea after surgery, and stool studies were  positive for C diff toxin.
Acute on chronic RI:  he has CRI, w/ baseline creatinine around 1.2 from DM.
Creatinine was elevated above baseline after surgery, likely [**1-20**] prerenal azotemia and worsening CHF, as supported by his low FEUrea of 14%.
At d/c, creatinine remains stable at baseline despite ongoing diuretic therapy and reinstitution of losartan.
LUE US showed non-occlussive DVT of L IJ and L subclavian veins, where infected central line was located.
This thrombus had developed in the setting of heparin therapy after surgery, and was suspected to be the source of bacterial showering and positive surveillance cultures during this admission.
Treatment was continued w/ coumadin for a goal INR of [**1-21**], and LUE edema showed some improvement by d/c.
He will require continued coumadin therapy for at least 6 months to prevent further thrombosis, and will need close f/u as an outpt to monitor coumadin dosing.
Pneumonia:  given the pt's persistent O2 requirement and exam indicating LLL consolidation despite treatment for CHF, CXR was obtained and demonstrated LLL infiltrate concerning for PNA.
Sputum cx was obtained and grew MRSA.
The pt should have repeat CXR 6-8 weeks after d/c to ensure resolution of LLL infiltrate.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
You will need repeat CTA of the torso to evaluate your surgical graft in [**12-20**] weeks, to be ordered by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
