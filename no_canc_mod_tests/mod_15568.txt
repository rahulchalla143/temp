An electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed hyperacute peaked T waves in leads V2 through V5.
A STAT echocardiogram showed a mid internal wall with mildly hypokinetic and the apex with moderate akinesis.
The patient's chest pain decreased to a [**2-5**], but was not completely resolved.
Coronary artery disease risk factors include smoking - one pack per day for 25 years and hyperlipidemia with an LDL of 209.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  A white blood cell count of 15.2, hematocrit of 44.2, platelets 239,000 with a differential of 68 polys, 26 lymphocytes, and INR of 1.2.
Sodium 141, potassium 3.9, chloride 108, bicarbonate 24, BUN 12, creatinine 0.9, glucose of 116, calcium of 8.2, potassium 4.5, magnesium 1.9.
A CK of 669 on admission that increased to 1202.
A troponin was measured to be 49.9.
Electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed normal [**Month/Year (2) **] rhythm at 60 beats per minute with a normal axis, normal intervals, T wave inversion in [**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] elevations in V2 through V4 with peaked T waves in V2 through V5, which is new compared to an electrocardiogram from [**2139-11-27**].
Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, no hypertrophy, a Q wave in [**Last Name (Titles) 1105**], T wave inversions in V2 through V5 improved from the outside hospital electrocardiogram.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate of 64.
Blood pressure 96/44.
Oxygen saturation 97%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Electrocardiogram showed anterior T wave changes and an electrocardiogram showed hypokinetic anterior wall with an akinetic apex.
The electrocardiogram normalized and he continued to have improvement of his chest pain.
His cardiac enzymes continued to be cycled and he was followed on telemetry.
The catheterization revealed a right dominant system with single vessel coronary artery disease.
Minimal resting hemodynamic measurements revealed mild systemic hypotension to low normal normotension and [**Month (only) **] rhythm.
Left ventriculography revealed an estimated ejection fraction of 50% and no significant mitral regurgitation.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and a 0% residual stenosis.
The plan was for him was to obtain a repeat echocardiogram as an outpatient in the next three months in order to assess his myocardium at that point.
He will need to have a repeat echocardiogram performed in about three months.
