MRCP showed 1cm common bile duct and intrahepatic ductal dilatation.

Echocardiogram [**2199-12-4**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
RUQ ultrasound showed distended gall bladder with positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign, and the patient was diagnosed with cholecystitis as well as pancreatitis.
Her white count dropped to 3.3 after the procedure and there was initial concern that the patient she was developing a septic picture, however blood cultures were negative, bile cultures grew MDR E-coli (although sensitivities at this point were still pending).
Gastroenterology and orthopaedic services were both consulting on the patient, and cardiac enzymes were sent that returned negative.
The patient remained afebrile, clinically stable, and her LFTs continued to trend down over the next several days while her white count returned to the normal range.
She was started on clears on [**11-23**] and MRCP was entertained but held given the presence of the external fixation device, as well as decreasing total bili and the recent OSH MRCP that did not reveal an obstruction.
She was transferred out of the ICU on [**2199-11-23**], with pancreatic enzymes normalized, and her antibiotic regimen was changed to imipenem once the bile cultures-Ecoli sensitivities returned.
Her LFTs seemed to reach a plateau in their decline near [**11-26**] and due to remaining above normal, and an increase in the wbc to 12, an ERCP was performed on [**11-27**] which revealed a non-dilated bile duct with a tapered stricture in the distal CBD.
CT scan was performed on [**11-29**], which did not reveal a mass or other cause of the CBD stricture.
Right lower extremity ultrasound was also performed per orthopaedic request that was negative for a DVT.
Her electrolytes were monitored closely and an echocardiogram was obtained that demonstrated EF 55% with relatively well-preserved global function.
Worry for a bile leak was primary reason for the paracentesis, which revealed simple ascites, likely due to malnutrition, and bile leak was ruled out.
Total bili fell to below 2 and her wbc again normalized.
On [**2199-12-6**] she was noted to have several small, loose stools and a cdiff test was sent that returned positive.
Her meropenem was discontinued on [**12-6**] after a full, 2 week course.
You have also been started on a new medication, coumadin, and your blood levels will need to be monitored very closely at first, with adjustments in the coumadin dosing as necessary.
Thoracic surgery was consulted during this hospitalization for a small abnormality on a chest x-ray, of which the patient and family were made aware.
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1504**].
Your primary care doctor may decide to repeat a chest x-ray first however, and then decide if further evaluation is necessary.
