IMAGING [**2132-8-18**] CARDIAC CATH: 1.
Coronary angiography in this right dominat system demonstrated single vessel disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 16 mmHg and PCW of 33 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was low at 2.2 L/min/min2.
There was normal arterial systolic and mildly elevated diastolic pressures at the aortic level with sBP 136 mmHg and DBP of 94 mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
# CHF: No history of CHF but has not had an echo since stress echo in [**2122**].
ECHO showed EF 45-50% with mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls, Mild-moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, and dilated thoracic aorta.
# RHYTHM: Evidence of first degree AV block on EKG back in [**2123**] as well as now.
He was monitored on telemetry and found to be in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Lipid panel showed HDL 43, CHOL/HDL 4.0, LDL 104.
