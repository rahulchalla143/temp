The next morning he was pain free but his bilirubin continued to climb from 2.6 upon admission.
Bilirubin now 4.5, AlkPhos 185, with a mild transamnitis (60s-80s).
Given his persistent pain and transaminitis, RUQ u/s was performed which revealed GB wall inflammation and thickening up to 1cm without any stones visualized.

The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Limited evaluation of gallbladder does not demonstrate evidence of acute cholecystitis .
ERCP performed here showed no gallstones, sludge or obstruction to explain elevated LFTs; CBD stent was placed (will require removal by repeat endoscopy as an outpatient after discharge).
Repeat ultrasound 24h after ERCP was nondiagnostic due to pneumobilia, likely secondary to ERCP.
HIDA scan did show biliary obstruction and surgery recommended percutaneous cholecystostomy, however patient's exam and LFTs improved after stent placement.
Repeat u/s showed a contracted gallblader and did not show evidence of cholecystitis, therefore no further intervention was performed.
Prior to discharge his LFTs continued to normalize and notably his total bilirubin normalized to 1.4.
Initial ABG with elevated paCO2 and on initial presentation he was somnolent, poorly ventilating when oversedated which all improved with BiPAP, which he wore at night and during daytime naps and during periods of increased somnolence.
Echo performed which showed an enlarged left atrium.
Goal INR [**1-15**].
Patient felt his pain was well-controlled on reduced MS contin dose of 60-75 mg TID + 20 mg PRN oxycodone while in the ICU.
Echo could not demonstrate diastolic dysfunction due to poor image quality.

You underwent an ERCP here, in which an endoscopic camera was used to look at your small intestine, pancreas, and gallbladder.
You also underwent another radiologic study which showed that there was an obstruction of your gallbladder that could not be seen during the ERCP.
You were given IV antibiotics and will need a total of 10 days.
You ate without abdominal pain and liver enzymes approached near normal prior to discharge.
You should follow up with a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment of this condition.
Continue Warfarin 7.5 mg daily and adjust dose based on INR (goal [**1-15**]) Continue Unasyn 3 mg every 6 hours for one more day.
