Urine culture showed mixed flora.
She was found to be confused without focal neurologic deficits and was seen by Neurology who felt supportive care with MRI and possible EEG after stabilization would be indicated.
She also developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.8.
Given thrombocytopenia, a HIT Ab was drawn which was equivocal and IgM APLA was positive, she was started on an Argatroban drip.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Culture data was obtained from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital which showed pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
The lasix dose will need to be titrated on an ongoing basis, and her weight should be followed, as she is incontent of urine.
C. Diff negative x1 but started empirically on PO vanco at [**Hospital1 1562**] and Flexiseal was placed.
Repeat C.diff was negative at [**Hospital1 18**], so metronidazole and oral vancomycin were discontinued.
# NSTEMI: Pt was found to have a Troponin up to 30 at [**Hospital1 1562**], likely in the setting of demand ischemia with known CAD as well as flash pulmonary edema/[**Hospital1 9215**].
Cardiac echo showed EF of 40-45% and mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD (inferior ischemia/infarction), mild mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and a small secundum ASD.
If her blood pressure is too low to tolerate an additional blood pressure medication at that time, consider discontinuation of clonidine.
Heart rate was generally well controlled.
The patient was started on warfarin, with a goal INR [**1-17**], given CHADS2 score of 4.
INR was 1.9 upon transfer to the acute rehab.
The patient was given multiple hypotonic fluid infusions to bring her serum [Na+] down.
Amylase was measured in the high 500s and lipase around [**2120**] at [**Hospital1 18**], and trended down.
Platelets were monitored and remained stable; pt does not have HIT.
# Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2: Fingersticks were checked and glucose was controlled with insulin sliding scale.
Her clonidine and amlodipine were continued, and she was started on carvedilol.
Her blood pressures were well controlled on the floor.
She was started on warfarin, and INR at time of transfer to rehab was 1.9.
She should continue heparin gtt until INR is [**1-17**] x at least 48 hours.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO DAYS ([**Doctor First Name **],MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA): Please monitor INR closely and titrate prn for goal INR [**1-17**].
Continue Heparin gtt as per sliding scale 14.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
Please continue heparin gtt for atrial fibrillation and DVT until INR is therapeutic ([**1-17**]) for at least 48 hours.
