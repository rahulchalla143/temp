In the Emergency Department, she had a chest x-ray which demonstrated right middle lobe pneumonia.
Arterial blood gas revealed 7.11/93/300.
A thick sputum was also suctioned from her.
Patient's blood pressure was systolic 120s to 140s and briefly dropped to 50/20.
Dopamine was changed to Neo with improvement of the patient's rate and pressure.
She received Ceftriaxone and Flagyl and 1400 cc of intravenous fluid and sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 101.8, 104.
Blood pressure 120/40.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Pinpoint pupils, but received morphine in the Emergency Department.
LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 22, hematocrit 47, creatinine of 2.1.
Chest x-ray with right middle lobe pneumonia.
Because the patient was noted to be noted to have severe wheezing and also had an effusion on chest x-ray, CT was performed of the chest which showed no change in her pneumonia.
Bronchoscopy demonstrated very severe tracheomalacia with 80-90% distal tracheal collapse, also severe malacia of her RMST/RBI with complete obstruction of the bassilar segments of the right lower lobe, moderate collapse of her left main stem bronchus.
Patient's blood pressure remained somewhat tenuous and the patient's Neo was changed to a vasopressin with good improvement.
She underwent cardiac echocardiogram which demonstrated normal ejection fraction, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Patient remained off her blood pressure medications with minor fluctuations in her blood pressure.
Patient became increasingly total volume overloaded during her admission, up to 20 liters positive.
She was restarted on vasopressin which provided only some improvement in her blood pressure.
Renal:  Patient was admitted with acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.0.
This slowly resolved over several days until she came to a creatinine of 0.8 which was felt to be her baseline.
Patient will have CT of the sinuses to rule out sinusitis.
She will be changed from Levaquin to vancomycin and ceftazidime for a presumed sinusitis until the CT scan results have returned.
Fluid and electrolytes:  The patient became increasingly volume overloaded during the length of her stay up to 20 liters positive.
