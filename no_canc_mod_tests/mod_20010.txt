The appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged, and it would probably be prudent to repeat the portable chest to better visualize the ETT if this is an issue.
Examination is otherwise unchanged from the earlier chest x-ray this morning at 9:00 a.m.  [**2199-11-7**] CT C-spine IMPRESSION: 1.
Anterolisthesis (grade 1) of the C5 on C6 and C7 on T1 vertebrae.
Compared to prior CT study of [**2199-1-15**], this subdural hematoma is a new finding.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-9-24**] artifact is present and ventricular premature beats are absent.
[**2199-11-10**] CXR Resolving congestive heart failure.
[**2199-11-10**] Head CT No interval change.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-11-8**] left anterior fascicular block is present and baseline artifact is no longer seen.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred intubated to the SICU for neuro checks and monitoring.
CT spine showed multiple old cervical fractures and cervical collar was placed.
