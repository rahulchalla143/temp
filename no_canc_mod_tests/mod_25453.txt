Had MRI which showed "extensive prevertebral phlegmon extending down towards the mediastinum with bilateral longus coli abscesses.
Her assessment was that as there are no motor defecits or clinical or radiological evidence of cord compression, intervention is not urgent.

[**2118-8-20**] CT Chest, Abd, Pelvis: 1.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
[**2118-8-24**] CT Chest: 1.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-8-23**], a catheter is seen in the right atrium.
[**2118-9-2**] CT Chest: 1.
He was started on intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics that were narrowed once blood culture data returned (see below re: bacteremia).
Additional imaging revealed continued/recurrent spinal prevertebral and epidural abscesses.
Additional imaging revealed no evidence of cord compression and decreased size of longus coli abscesses.
His blood cultures from the outside hospital and on presentation to our facility grew coag + staph aureus, for which he was started on intravenous vancomycin and nafcillin.
His surveillance cultures all returned negative.
He had two TTEs and one intra-operative TEE to evaluate for vegetations, which were not seen.
He was then began on Coumadin, which he will continue as an outpatient (goal INR [**12-22**]).
His INR was theraputic for 24 hours prior to discontinuation of the heparin gtt and discharge from the hospital.
A RUQ ultrasound and CT of the abdomen did not reveal any dilation of the intra/extra hepatic biliary ducts, gallbladder pathology, or abscess collections.
His hepatitis and HIV serologies were negative.
His enzymes trended down to normal as his clinical picture improved.
Imaging studies also commented on appearance of chronic anemia.
Speech was consulted and the patient had a video swallowing study, which showed laryngeal penetration of thin and nectar thick liquids but no aspiration.
Over his hospital course his dysphagia improved and his diet was advanced to regular solids.
We then started you on another blood thinner, Coumadin, which you will continue to take for 3 month to treat the blood clots.
You will need to have frequent lab work to monitor your INR to adjust your Coumadin dose as needed.
