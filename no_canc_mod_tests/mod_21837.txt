He was able to get down to a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 by [**12-9**].
The patient was stable and able to maintain his oxygen saturations at greater than 97%.
From a cardiac standpoint, the patient was weaned off almost all of his intravenous Lopressor and had to be started on a diltiazem drip and titrated up to a maximum dose to decrease his heart rate.
Unfortunately, on [**12-9**], the patient had a systolic blood pressure in the 70s and an increased heart rate.
The patient's heart rates ranged in the 120s, and the patient spiked a fever of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
The only culture that came back positive for the patient at this time was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus which was growing out of his sputum.
Fortunately, no further cultures were positive at this time, and the patient was maintained on his broad spectrum antibiotics.
An electroencephalogram was done at this time which indicated that the patient had a very depressed responsiveness and poor brain activity.
Despite the clinical picture of sepsis, the patient did not grow any further positive blood cultures other than the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum.
The formal read of the electroencephalogram done on [**12-15**] demonstrated diffuse delta slowing; indicative of an encephalopathic appearance.
The patient's head computed tomography did reveal bilateral watershed infarctions but did not affect the hypothalamus.
The patient did very well on tracheostomy mask and was able to maintain his oxygen saturations at greater than 97%.
The patient was able to maintain stable oxygen saturations with 35% oxygen.
From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient continued to be tachycardic in the range of 100 to 100s and slightly hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of up to 190 mmHg.
The patient was maintained on Lopressor to help control his blood pressure.
The patient's systolic blood pressures were maintained in the 140 to 180 range; depending on his level of activity.
as needed for a heart rate greater than 110 or a systolic blood pressure of greater than 160.
