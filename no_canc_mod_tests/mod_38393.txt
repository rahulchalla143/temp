Lab studies and CXR done.
Initial vitals: T 98.6  HR 120, BP 167/106, RR 12  97%RA.
ECG showed sinus tachycardia with rate 110 bpm, nml axis, nml intervals, isolated ST-elevated V3, ST-depression V4-V6, nonsignificant Q-wave III, no TWI.
Initial CXR showed LUL cavitary lesion decreasing in size, parenchymal RUL/LUL changes, increased vascularity and bronchial cuffing; no effusion.
First set of cardiac enzymes negative with CK 107; Trop <0.01.
He then received 5mg iv metoprol and became hypotensive with BP 78/50.

ECHO [**9-9**]: 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Exercise MIBI [**9-10**]:  IMPRESSION: Global hypokinesis with enlarged left ventricular size consitent with dilated cardiomyopathy.
Echo showed EF 15-20%, stress showed no reversible changes.
An a-line was placed, and the pt was stable overnight.
Sputum x 2 were neg for AFB and then it was confirmed that the pt had been adequately treated for his past pulmon TB and w/u was discontinued.
The pt remained stable, echo was obtained and pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**].
# Systolic heart failure: EF of 15-20%, no LV enlargement on echo, but dilation seen on stress MIBI.
Echo showed a severely decreased LVEF (15-20%) without LV dilation.
Stress MIBI showed no reversible defects but showed an enlarged ventricle.
# DMII: Held oral agents because metformin is contraindicated prior to cath and it was unclear if cath would be needed.
