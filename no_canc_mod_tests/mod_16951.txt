His [**Hospital6 8866**] course was also notable for being discharged on Flagyl, levofloxacin and Keflex for a two week course and complicated by pharyngocutaneous fistula as well as Mobitz type I arrhythmia.
He was sent to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and one day prior to admission he was noted to be in respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 30 to 32 and minimally responsive to albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.
Vital signs at that time were temperature 98.3, blood pressure 160/100, heart rate 104, 97% in room air.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 346**] blood pressure was 60/30, respiratory rate 28, 98% on 100% tent mask.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 31%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.0, blood pressure 117/61, heart rate 88, respiratory rate 12, 100% on trach mask.
Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2.
Lungs clear to auscultation on left anterior laterally, decreased breath sounds with occasional crackles on right.
Abdominal exam soft, distended, percussive, decreased bowel sounds, no suprapubic tenderness.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 19.5, 77% neutrophils, 18% lymphocytes, hematocrit 36.9, platelets 441, MCV 99.
Sodium 130, potassium 5.9, chloride 97, CO2 25, BUN 23, creatinine 0.7, glucose 314.
Urinalysis was positive for nitrites, 500 glucose, 0 to 2 white blood cells, occasional bacteria, no yeast.
Chest x-ray revealed diffuse right infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia, also possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
EKG #1 revealed tachycardia at 122, no P waves seen, new right bundle branch block with T wave inversions in V1 through V5, Q waves in V2 through V5.
EKG #2 revealed sinus tachycardia at 106, normal axis, old ST depressions in V5 through V6, T wave inversion in V4, old Qs in V3 and V4 with resolved right bundle branch block.
Otorhinolaryngology was consulted emergently for evaluation of his tracheostomy and further workup of his right lung collapse.
His oxygenation continued to remain satisfactory.
His antibiotic regimen was tailored based on his sputum gram stain revealing moderate growth of gram negative rods and patient will complete a 10 day course of ceftazidime.
Cardiac enzymes were subsequently drawn and there was noted to be a peak CK of 156 with MB of 7 and peak troponin of 13.5.
No further workup was suggested at this time.
His blood pressure remained stable throughout his hospital course after initial presentation.
The patient was noted to have an admission hematocrit of 37 which slowly down-trended with IV fluid hydration.
He is to have a barium upper GI series which will be performed at [**Hospital6 8866**] for further evaluation of his swallowing.
