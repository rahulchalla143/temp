STUDIES: .
.. CORONARY CATHETERIZATION ([**2148-9-12**]): 1.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA comments).
Right heart cardiac catheterization following successful PCI demonstrated elevated right (RVEDP=23mm Hg) and left (mean PCWP=28mm Hg) heart filling pressures.
Following successful PCI, the pressors were able to be weaned down and the cardiac index was 2.4 l/min/m2.
Cardiogenic shock 3.
.. TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2148-9-13**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%); the posterior wall may be hypokinetic but was poorly visualized.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2148-9-13**]): Mild scoliosis and rotation of the patient limit the evaluation of the left hilum.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Her cardiac enzymes peaked at CK of 1755 and TropT of 6.19.
.. # PUMP: Her EF was unknown at time of admission; during the cath, her elevated RAP and wedge were consistent with left heart failure and cardiogenic shock.
However, this was quickly weaned down on HD 1 as her right ventricular function improved.
An echo on HD 1 showed a preserved LVEF of 70%; however, there was right ventricular cavity dilatation with depressed free wall contractility and possible posterior wall hypokinesis.
As her blood pressure tolerated, she was re-started on a BB and ACEI.
These were rapidly uptitrated because her blood pressure continued to be elevated as her RV function improved.
At time of discharge she had an INR of 1.3 and will continue to have daily INR checks via PICC line while on Lovenox and Warfarin with an end INR goal of [**1-21**].
Also of note, liver function tests and pulmonary function tests should be obtained as outpatient now that she is starting therapy with amiodorone.
.. # ANEMIA:  Her hematocrit at admission was noted to be in the mid 20s, down from her baseline mid to high 30s.
The patient's hematocrit continued to have mild suboptimal range during hospitalization and she was found to have a guiac positive stool prior to discharge.
This warrants a further outpatient GI workup for this anemia.
.. # DIABETES:  We checked an HgA1c which came back at 7.4 on [**2148-9-15**].
.. # HYPERTENSION:  As above, better controlled blood pressure primarily with the combination of ACEI, BB, and Amiodorone.
