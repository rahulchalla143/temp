[**8-23**] CXR #2- Left PICC line ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.
Lung volumes remain very low, but the clearing of opacification at the left lung base suggest that this was largely atelectasis.

His persistent hypoxia was attributed to the resolving treated pneumonia, transpulmonary shunting (TTE on [**8-16**] consistent with this), likely smoking related parenchymal lung disease, deconditioning with poor clearance of upper airway secretions and restriction from large volume ascites.
He underwent diagnostic paracentesis in the MICU (negative for SBP) and several therapeutic paracenteses ([**8-17**]- 3L, [**8-19**] 10L, [**8-23**] 3L, [**8-26**] 4L) which were also negative for SBP.
As part of his transplant evaluation patient underwent echocardiogram w/ bubble study which showed transpulmonary shunting with supine room air ABG pO2 57, though the patient had no orthodeoxia.
Patient also underwent colonoscopy which showed angioectasia in the sigmoid colon and non-bleeding rectal varices.
He responded partially to albumin, but creatinine on discharge remained stable around 1.3.
Would recommend further evaluation and consideration of treatment for hepatorenal syndrome.
Hct remained stable, guaiac negative, and patient was supplemented with B12 and folate.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
His tubefeeds and vitamins should be continued on discharge.
We also performed an endoscopy to examine your varices and a colonoscopy as part of your liver transplant evaluation.
Your blood sugars were slightly elevated during this hospitalization- we recommend that you discuss this with your primary care doctor for further management.
