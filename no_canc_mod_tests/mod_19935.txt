The patient has been followed by echocardiograms for her mitral regurgitation, and most recent echo from [**Month (only) **] of this year revealed 4 plus mitral regurgitation with mitral annular calcification, as well as a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 percent.
The patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65 percent, and severe pulmonary hypertension.
Calcium supplements.
The patient had remained in normal sinus rhythm, or being paced by her permanent pacemaker,  tracking her native atrial rate, until [**11-5**] when she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation early in the morning with a rate between 100 and 120.
Her blood pressure remained stable throughout this time, and her Lopressor was increased, as was her amiodarone.
She continued to progress slowly from a physical therapy and rehabilitation standpoint, although remained in atrial fibrillation, was anticoagulated for it, and her rate was controlled.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm.
Her Steri-Strips to her sternal incision were clean, dry and intact, as was her right lower extremity incision.
The patient was scheduled to have a chest x-ray prior to discharge today, and the results of that were still pending.
She is then to have an INR checked in rehab on [**11-8**], and her Coumadin dose should be adjusted accordingly for a target INR of 2.0-2.5.
The patient's INR yesterday, [**11-5**], was 2.1, and she received 2 mg, and today her INR was 2.5, and she will receive 1 mg today.
