Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
# MSSA Bacteremia - blood cultures ([**3-3**]) bottles from admission positive for MSSA.
Pt refused MRI imaging, but should consider outpatient open MRI if does not continue to have improvement.
All surveillance cultures since admission have had no growth to date.
# Endocarditis - in setting of MSSA bacteremia, pt was found to have 1.4cm vegetation on aortic valve, new since echo in [**3-9**], with moderate aortic insufficiency.
Cardiology and CT surgery were consulted and did not recommend acute surgical intervention given bacteremia and no decompensated heart function.
Daily ECGs did not show any abnormalities, pt had hypotension to SBP 100 throughout most of hospital stay and one episode of fever to 100.5 a week into therapy; given this, a TEE was done to evaluate for cardiac abscess and was negative for this.
Cr improved to 1.3 today, FeNa 2.5% and FeUrea 52% both of which suggest resolution of pre-renal state - encourage PO intake - continue to trend Cr .
# Hypotension - now improved, SBP 110s-120s.
- encourage PO intake - monitor on tele, daily ECGs - continue abx as above .
# Anemia - chronic, HCT baseline 26-27, [**Month/Day (2) **] studies in [**2145**] revealed likely etiology as anemia of chronic inflammation.
- T+S, PIV - peripheral smear - no schistocytes - B12 / folate - normal .
Pt had liver biopsy in [**6-6**] which showed fibrosis with no clear etiology for hepatomegaly.
- outpt work-up for ?malignancy - LFTs stable  # IVDU - pt reports being clean for 6 months - social work consult MICU Course The patient is a 46 yo F with hx of IVDU complicated by MSSA verebral osteo [**2143**], and prior history of endocarditis [**2145**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], h/o MRSA/pseudomonal hip wound infection, HCV, granulomatous disease of GI tract, chronic inguinal ulcers, and anxiety with MSSA endocarditis who was transferred to the MICU for hypercarpic respiratory failure and code blue after being briefly unresponsive.
Hypercarpic Respiratory Failure:  Pt initial ABG showed ph 6.84 and PCO2 of 112.
CXR did not show clear evidence of acute pathology.
Pt had stat ECHO performed at bedside by cardiology  ID consulted and recommended changing to vancomycin and meropenem given concern for sepsis upon initial presentation to ICU, which was later switched back to Nafcillin given stable BP's and clinical status, as this provides better coverage of her MSSA bacteremia.Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures .
TTE repeated yesterday showed EF 40%, worsening AR.
ECG Changes: Pt with inverted t-waves in the setting of her severe acidosis and tachycardia.
MRI of the cervial and thoracic spine was unremarkable and trauma surgery cleared the patient.
# Inguinal ulcers - [**3-1**] long-standing heroin use.
Pt had liver biopsy in [**6-6**] which showed fibrosis with no clear etiology for hepatomegaly.
[**Month (only) 116**] be hypoperfusion [**3-1**] cardiogenic shock.
Urine lytes showed a boderline prerenal etiology with Fe urea 28%.
#Anemia: Hct drop from 27 to 22 this morning, 20 on repeat.
Transfused 2 units PRBCs,did not increase appropiately to first unit and DIC labs were sent which were unremarkable, Guiac stools...  Cardiac Surgery Course: The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2146-12-21**] where the patient underwent aortic valve replacement with 23mm Porcine tissue valve.
HepC, ascites,T9 osteo w/paraspinal abscess [**2143**],hepatosplenomegaly   Discharge Condition: Alert and oriented x3 nonfocal Ambulating, gait steady Sternal pain managed with oral analgesics Sternal Incision - healing well, no erythema or drainage Edema- 1+ LEs   Discharge Instructions: Medical Service: It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**].
We did an echocardiogram of your heart which showed that the bacteria had spread to a valve in your heart.
