Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2139-9-8**] 11:04 AM [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    77 year old woman s/p CEA and non-focal mental depression REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    Altered mental status CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:    None.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are scattered focal hypodensities of indeterminate age, most likely secondary to small vessel ischemic changes; attention to this finding on followup is advised.
Consider MR study if clinically indicated and if there are no contraindications.
On POD #1, was tolerating clears [**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes.
When pt with persistent altered mental status, she was ordered for head CT on [**9-8**].
Most recent CXR on [**9-10**] states "Small left pleural effusion, otherwise clear lungs with stable cardiomegaly."
WBC counts have fluctuated.
EVALUATION: The examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in the chair on the VICU.
She received 1500 cc of fluid during the case and had an EBL of 200 cc.
She was breathing 15 times a minute with an O2 sat of 100% on 3L NC.
She was requiring a nitro gtt and intermittent hydralazine to keep her blood pressures in the desired range of 100-140.
Her neck incision did slowly ooze blood, requiring a few dressing changes but there was no airway compression or rapidly expanding hematoma.
On [**9-1**], POD #1, the patient continued to have some increased work of breathing,decreased urine output, CXR showed some fluid overload and she was given lasix 80mg IV and put out about 100 cc of urine hourly throughout the day.
She maintained her sats in the mid 90's throughout the day on 2-3L NC.
At 9pm, her work of breathing continued to increase with RR 30-35, sats mid 90's, an additional 40mg of lasix was given, without much improvement in her respiratory status.
BNP was increased to 13,000, she also had a troponin leak to peak of .72.
Atrius cardiology followed the patient during her stay and felt that she was having demand ischemia secondary to the fluid overload and diastolic heart failure and did not feel she was having an MI.
Her creatinine trended up to the 2.6-3.0 range with adequate urine output and nephrology was consulted.
They followed her care and her creatinine trended down but has not yet reached her baseline.
On [**9-3**], POD#3, she had a low grade fever and her CXR showed concern for possible RLL infiltrate and she was started on vancomycin/cefepime to empirically treat for VAP.
Her blood pressure throughout her hospital stay was difficult to control and she required standing metoprolol, hydralazine, addition of PO agents, and intermittent IV hydralazine/metoprolol at times.
Diamox was used for ongoing diuresis, bicarb and creatinine were monitored with a goal of [**1-31**].5 L negative daily.
After extubation she was slow to improve her mental status with an elevated BUN/Cr, and a head CT was performed which was grossly negative for an acute process.
Her labs continued to trend down, she tolerated a regular diet, and her blood pressures were better controlled on her new regimen.
She had some loose stools over the weekend and a c.diff was sent which was negative.
Her discharge plan involves BP monitoring on a new regimen, and close follow up to alter that regimen as necessary.
