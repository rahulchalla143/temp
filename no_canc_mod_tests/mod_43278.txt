The Stroke Service was called and stroke protocol was begun with an MRI obtained which was positive for a large subacute left hemisphere subdural hematoma measuring up to 1.5 cm in thickness and moderate midline shift.
The family is uncertain whether any abnormality was seen on the CT scan at that time.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  History of syncopal episode in [**2181-10-13**] for which an echocardiogram was done and he showed an ejection fraction 60% with 3+ mitral valve regurgitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the vital signs were within normal limits.
The heart rate was regular and rhythmic without murmur, gallop, or rub.
The abdominal examination was unremarkable.
Sensory was intact to light touch throughout.
The deep tendon reflexes were essentially within normal limits with the exception of a mildly decreased left knee or patellar reflex and absent bilateral Achilles reflex.
LABORATORIES/OTHER STUDIES:  The admission laboratories were all considered to be within normal limits, particularly his coagulation studies with a PT of 12.8, PTT 30.5, and INR 1.1.  Review of the MRI did confirm the presence of a large left-sided subdural hematoma.
A follow-up CT scan showed marked decrease in the size of the subdural hematoma.
The subdural drain was, therefore, removed and the patient was transferred from the unit to the [**Hospital 16364**] Medical Surgical floor where he remained throughout the remainder of his hospitalization in stable condition.
He was told not to renew his aspirin and to follow-up with his primary care physician within one weeks time and to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6910**] at approximately one months time with a follow-up CT scan to be done at that time.
