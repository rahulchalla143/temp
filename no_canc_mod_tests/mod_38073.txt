The estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-4-2**], the left ventricular cavity is slightly larger and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of endocarditis.
LIMITED ULTRASOUND EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT FOREARM IN THE REGION OF THE AV FISTULA: Arteriovenous fistula is identified with appropriate aliasing on color flow images and appropriate Doppler flow.
CT ABD and Pelvis 1.
The exam is somewhat limited without the administration of oral contrast.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 65 year old man with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with EF 20%, diabetes, and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who presents with mental status changes and fever, found with streptococcal septicemia due to Strep Viridans.
