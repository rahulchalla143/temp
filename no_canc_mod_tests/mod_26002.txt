She was worked up and had a bronchoscopy on [**1-16**] and was noted to have a tracheostomy tube completely occluded by a tissue mass - ?granulation tissue.
The bronchoscope could not advance past the mass, so the trach tube was pulled back slightly and the mass was better visualized.
She is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of the mass and possible resection.

CT neck and chest were done revealing a 3-cm long, subcutaneous, pretracheal, low cervical tract, without clear intrathoracic extension or abscess, and multifocal atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.
The patient was transfused 2 units PRBC for hct of around 22, and extubated [**2121-1-23**].
Cultures grew out pseudomonas only sensitive to tobra and gent.
In the meantime another right BKA wound culture was sent on [**2121-1-27**], and recommendations were made to stop all antibiotics, and when the patient underwent future vascular surgery for her stump, she should be treated with antibiotics.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2121-1-27**] showing trauma to posterior wall.
We have sent off another culture of the right BKA today, and will follow this as an outpatient.
