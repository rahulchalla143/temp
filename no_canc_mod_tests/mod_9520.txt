VITAL SIGNS:  Her blood pressure is high at 213/65.
Her heart rate is 62.
This high blood pressure responded to nitroglycerin and hydralazine and her recheck blood pressure was 180/100.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
She also received a CT which showed complete small bowel obstruction with a transition point appearing to be in the right lower quadrant.
PERTINENT LABS:  Of note, the patient's creatinine upon presentation was up to 2.2 and her potassium was greater than 10.
She had a troponin of 0.6, CK of 254 and an MB of 6.
Pathology shows a segment of ileum with focal mucosal hemorrhage and serosal changes consistent with adhesions.
She was placed on intravenous metoprolol and hydralazine prn for high blood pressure and she was also having troponins checked to rule out for a possible myocardial infarction.
These troponins never raised around 1.7 and the level of 2 at which we consider a myocardial infarction has occurred.
The patient's creatinine also came down to about 1.6 with good fluid resuscitation.
The patient was monitored with electrocardiogram, blood pressure in her A-line and SAO2 throughout the procedure and neither showed any changes.
The chest x-ray post line placement also showed it was in the correct position.
The head CT showed no blood or mass effect.
Neurology's recommendations were to obtain an MRI to better evaluate the posterior circulation which was also done which showed no evidence of occlusion in any of the major intracranial vessels or stenosis.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Small bowel obstruction, status post exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Timolol maleate 0.25% 1 drop each eye [**Hospital1 **] 5.
Brimonidine tartrate 0.15% 1 drop each eye tid  FOLLOW UP PLANS: 1.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the patient was to follow up with him for among other things to manage her hypertension.
