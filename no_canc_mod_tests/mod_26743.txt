[**Known lastname **] developed a spontaneous ileal perforation with a volvulus, which was repaired at [**Hospital3 1810**] on day of life #5.
He was     started on SIMV at settings of 18/5, and a rate of 20,     and 25-30%; and was increased to settings today at time     of transfer to 26/7, and a rate of 35, and anywhere from     40-100% oxygen.
His chest x-ray was     notable for a right upper lobe collapse and intermittent     right lower lobe collapse as well.
His caffeine was     discontinued on [**2-28**].
On [**2-28**], he had a     transient decrease in his mean arterial pressure to 26,     responding to a bolus of normal saline.
His AP has been 120s     to 140s.
He had 1 episode of a mean [**Month (only) **] pressure in     the 60s earlier today, responding to a dose of fentanyl     for presumed discomfort.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  On [**1-21**] when     [**Known lastname **] returned from the [**Hospital3 1810**], he was on     total fluids of 140/kg of breast milk 20 calorie by     continuous feeds.
On [**1-25**], secondary to     lethargy and a decreased urine output, a workup revealed     a serum sodium of 118, a serum potassium of 8.9;     necessitating a normal saline bolus and a sodium     replacement infusion.
He also received calcium gluconate     x 1 dose and an insulin infusion with concurrent high     glucose infusion to decrease his serum potassium.
A BUN/creatinine at that time was noted to be     elevated with a BUN of 31 and a creatinine of 1.3, which     corrected over the next 48 hours to 12 and 0.6.
The serum electrolytes continued to improve     on this half-volume replacement with half normal saline,     and he was transitioned off of his replacement on [**2-8**]; at which time oral sodium chloride and potassium     chloride supplements were started.
These have been     weaned as well for serum sodium's of 140 and potassium's     of greater than 5.
On [**2-26**], his electrolytes were     135, 5.2, 106 and 19.
Also in relation to his fluids and     electrolytes, [**Known lastname **] was restarted on feeds on [**1-28**] after the electrolyte aberration and quickly advanced     to full volume.
Increasing calories on [**2-6**], was     tolerating continuous feeds of breast milk 30 with     Beneprotein.
On day of transfer, he was     receiving D-7.5 with 2.5 mg/kg of protein, 2 mg/kg of     lipids, 3 mEq/kg of sodium, and 3 mEq of potassium - half     chloride, half acetate.
Most recent set of electrolytes were at 11:00 a.m.     on [**3-2**]:  Sodium 134, potassium 3.6, chloride 101,     and CO2 of 29, glucose was 88.
LFTs were     obtained on [**3-2**] with an ALT of 65, an AST of 86.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On [**1-26**], during the     decompensation secondary to electrolyte imbalance, [**Known lastname **]     had a sepsis evaluation - including [**Known lastname **], stool and     urine cultures - all of which remained negative.
His cultures remained     negative.
His CBC was benign, and he completed 48 hours     of vancomycin and cefotaxime.
He had [**Known lastname **], urine and stool     cultures sent again on [**2-28**] and [**3-1**].
His gentamicin levels on [**3-2**] were 0.3 and     5.3.
Vancomycin on [**3-2**], levels were 13.6 and     31.1.
His hematocrit on [**3-2**] is 42.5.
The initial CBC on     [**2-28**] showed a white count of 10; a hematocrit of     35; platelets of 700,000; and nonshifted differential.
On [**3-1**], his white count was noted to be 7.6; and     at this time the differential was markedly shifted with     15 polys, 39 bands, 36 lymphs, and 8 myelos.
He     continued on antibiotics, and a repeat [**Month (only) **] culture was     sent at that time as well.
On [**3-2**], his CBC was     notable for a white count of 6.3, with 12 poly's, 8     bands, 43 lymphs, 18 monos, and 7 metamyelocytes.
[**Known lastname **]     had coagulation studies performed on [**2-28**] with a PT     of 16.6, a PTT of 68.8, and INR of 1.5.
On [**3-2**], a     PT of 20, a PTT of greater than 150, a fibrinogen of 443     were reported; with a question of whether this was a half-     absorbed specimen or not.
NEUROLOGIC:  Head ultrasound on [**2-19**] was normal for     age.
Initial head ultrasound done at [**Hospital3 1810**]     was notable for some echogenicities in the subependymal     region of the frontal horns, and recommendation for MRI     at term was recommended by the radiologist at that time.
His exam has been appropriate for     his postmenstrual age.
OPHTHALMOLOGY:  An ROP screen performed on [**2-9**]     showed immature retinae to zone 2.
On [**2-23**], a     repeat examination showed stage I zone 2 in the right and     immature zone 2 in the left.
