Cath [**2178-2-10**]: COMMENTS:     1.
Initial angiography of the aortic arch was obtained revealing a type 1 aortic arch without critical stenosis atthe level of the arch.
Selective images were then obtained of the right and then the left carotid arteries with a 5fr [**Doctor Last Name **] 1 catheter.
The right ICA fills the ipsilateral AC and MCA intracerebrally with cross-filling noted of the contralateral ACA.
Final angiography revealed a 10% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and brisk flow (see ptca comments).
Limited hemodynamics revealed a central aortic pressure of 196/69.
She was evaluated by cardiovascular medicine and underwent cath on [**2178-2-10**].
Angiography demonstrated: right common carotid: minimal disease, right ICA has a 65% lesion proximally just distal to the CCA bulb.
Final angiography revealed a 10% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and brisk flow.
Normal neuro exam post stenting.
Her PCM backup rate was increased from 40bpm to 50bpm givnen her symptomatic bradycardia.
Her digoxin, amlodipine, lisnopril, lasix and imdur were discontinued until her scheduled outpatient follow up with cardiology.
#Bradycardia/Mobitz 1: The Mobitz 1 heart block is new since her last admission and she descibes increased fatigue.
Her digoxin level was elevated and her medication was held.
Concern because mobitz [**6-4**] worsen with vagal stimulation (and carotid stents frequently complicated by high vagal tone so her PCM backup rate was increased to 50bpm as above.
CAD: Cardiac cath on [**1-17**] showed stable coronary anatomy with known RCA occlusion supplied by collaterals.
Her lisinopril, amlodipine, and imdur were held as above.
Then 150meq Bicarb at 120cc 1 hour prior to cath and 60cc/hr for 6hr after.
