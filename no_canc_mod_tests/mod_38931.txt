LVEF 30% with known dilated cardiomyopathy.
BP improved to 100s/60s.
#Hypertension: Patient's home regimen was continued on the floor, but his SBP dipped into the high 80s and low 90s so lisinopril was decreased to 20mg po daily and his SBP remained 100-130. .
# L1 compression fracture: After the patient fell, he was complaining of low back pain so a L-spine Xray was performed and showed L1 compressin fracture with No cord impingement on imaging.
WBC 12 on day of discharge .
He should have repeat creatinine and labs on [**3-22**] to ensure stability.
