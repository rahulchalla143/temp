Colonoscopies: ===================== Colonoscopy [**2173-7-30**] Diverticulosis only in the sigmoid [**Month/Day/Year 499**].
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to cecum ------------------- Colonoscopy [**2168**] Diverticulosis of the sigmoid [**Year (4 digits) 499**] Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: High fiber diet Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as needed Colonoscopy in [**5-6**] years Additional notes: The efficiency of colonoscopy in detecting lesions was discussed with the patient and it was pointed out that a small percentage of polyps and other lesions can be missed with the test.
Degree of difficulty = 2 (5 most difficult) ------- Colonoscopy [**2163**]: Polyp at distal sigmoid -------  Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: ==================================== Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 y/o M with a hx of CAD (s/p DES to LAD in [**2166**]), atrial fibrillation, diverticulosis, and massive GIB in the [**2131**], who was admitted with lower GI bleed 2 months after starting Pradaxa for AFib; likely Diverticular Bleeding  ACTIVE ISSUES: ======================= # Lower GI bleed:  Most likely diverticular bleed in setting of new dabigatran use.
A CTA was performed while bleeding on [**7-28**] which showed descending colonic diverticulitis with active extravasation from a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery.
He had no further events but Hct trended down from baseline 44 to 26.4 at lowest and he required transfusion of 5 units of packed red cells.
A colonoscopy was performed on [**2173-7-30**] which showed only diverticulosis with no source of bleed.
After that point he stabilized without further evidence of bleeding and his HCT trended up to 35 prior to discharge.
# Diverticulitis: Patient had abdominal pain on admission and CTA showed diverticulitis.
