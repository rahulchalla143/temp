She underwent colonoscopy which revealed a blood clot overlying a visible vessel which was thought to be a bleeding artery.
She was then taken to a second colonoscopy which showed continued bleeding with areas of ulceration, therefore the patient was taken to the OR by colorectal surgery for ligation of the area under MAC.
If she returns with bleeding, the team should preform an MRI or endoscopic ultrasound to find out if this is arterial or venous.
# Coagulopathy: While the paitent had a GI bleed, she was given a total of 4 units of FFP and 10mg of Vit K x3 days to correct her elevated INR.
Thourough workups were done each time to find the etiolgy of these states, including an EEG which showed severe encephlopathy.
Her Lasix was decreased to 40mg a day becasue her blood pressure was lower than her baseline (baseline being 100 - 110 systolic).
VNA will check her HCT QOD and she has an appointment with her PCP in less than 1 week.
