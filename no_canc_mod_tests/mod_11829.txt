screens 0 positive, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, GBS unknown and human immunodeficiency virus negative.
Fetal heart tracings showed decelerations during this event but stabilization afterwards.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission weight 540 gm, less than 10th percentile, length 30.5 cm 10th percentile, head circumference 22.5 cm 10th percentile.
Current weight 1465 gm, 10th percentile, length 35 cm, 10th percentile, head circumference 30.25 cm, less than 25th percentile.
Vital signs on admission revealed temperature 37, heartrate 156, respiratory rate 40s, blood pressure 49/25 with a mean of 34.
Cardiovascular, S1 and S2 normal intensity, no murmur.
Current physical examination reveals with endotracheal tube, 3.0 cm tube taped at 7.4 cm marker at the lip on ventilator settings of 27/7 and a rate of 36, requiring FIO2 of 30 to 40%.
Baseline blood pressure is 60s to 70s/30s to 40s with means in the 40s to 50s.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory - The baby initially received three doses of Surfactant and required conventional ventilation with peak pressures of 22/5 and a rate of 35.
She had peak pressures of MAP of [**9-15**] and Delta P of 22, required several bicarbonate boluses for metabolic and respiratory acidosis.
She ultimately transitioned again to the conventional ventilator on day of life #12 with settings of 22/6 and a rate of 28, requiring 35% oxygen.
She has remarkably weaned her vent settings over the last several days from 28/7 and a rate of 40, overnight on [**5-23**] to 19 escalated to 100% oxygen and began a watch for necrotizing enterocolitis.
She has had her rate weaned over the course of the day with her last decrease down to a rate of 36 with 27/7 and oxygen requirement of 30 to 40%.
She received another echocardiogram on day of life #3 which showed a large patent ductus arteriosus with left to right flow and right ventricular hypertrophy.
She had a follow up echocardiogram on [**4-3**] that showed no patent ductus arteriosus with right ventricular pressure greater than half the systemic and again on [**4-17**], which showed no patent ductus arteriosus, no evidence of vegetation and no ventriculoseptal defect.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The baby initially was NPO.
She had electrolytes within normal limits on [**5-22**] with a sodium of 135, potassium of 4.6, chloride 101 and carbon dioxide of 23.
Her sodium has trended downward with a low of 127, 3.4, 89, 21, on [**5-25**] in AM BUN 22, creatinine .5.
She has had no stools since [**5-24**] and her urine output in the past 24 hours is approximately 2 cc/kg/hr.
Her Phenobarbital started on [**4-18**] when her bilirubin was 8.9/7.3, 1.6.
Her last bilirubin on [**5-22**] was 8/6.1 1.9.
Her hematocrit has dropped over the last 24 hours from 43 to 28.
Her platelet count dropped from 73,000 down to 42,000.
She received 20 cc/kg of platelets this morning [**5-25**] and platelet count is pending at the time of this dictation.
Infectious disease - The baby's original blood culture and complete blood count on admission had a white count of 2.2 with 26 polys, 0 bands, 63 lymphocytes and platelet count of 137,000 and hematocrit of 39.
At 48 hours the cultures were negative and the antibiotics were discontinued.
On [**4-6**], day of life 9 she for lability had a repeat blood culture and complete blood count sent and was started on 48 hours of Vancomycin and gentamicin.
She received a blood transfusion at that time and looked clinically improved and antibiotics were discontinued.
Again on [**4-17**] to [**4-18**] she had a sepsis evaluation because of instability and also right upper lobe collapse on chest x-ray.
On [**4-19**], her trach aspirate was positive for Staphylococcus aureus.
Other positive results - [**5-16**], Urine culture positive for Escherichia coli which was resistant to Ampicillin, Piperacillin and Trimethoprim.
[**5-17**], Urine fungal culture negative.
[**5-17**], Blood fungal culture negative.
[**5-18**], Blood culture negative for fungus and bacteria.
[**5-15**], she had an abdominal ultrasound done to rule out abscess.
[**5-24**], Blood culture remains negative to date.
Complete blood count serially from [**5-24**], started with white count of 14.3 with 40 polys, 0 bands, 61 lymphs and platelet count of 73,000, hematocrit of 43.8.
Later in the day white count dropped to 6.2 and platelet count to 42,000, hematocrit 36.7.
Early AM on [**5-25**], white count was 4.6 with 49 polys, 13 bands and platelet count of 42,000.
Neurology - The baby has had serial head ultrasounds done, the last one being on [**4-18**], all within normal limits.
Ophthalmology - Her eye examination, last one done on [**5-17**], which showed immature Zone 2 with a plan to repeat in two weeks.
State newborn screens have been serially done, initially there were some repeats done because of presumed prematurity and the last one was in range.
Chronic lung disease with pneumatoceles 6.
