Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease in a right dominant circulation.
Resting hemodynamics from right and left heart catheterization reveal elevated right sided filling pressures RVEDP=11mmHg and normal left sided filling pressures LVEDP=11mmHg and mean PCWP=11mmHg.
Cardiac output and index were 4.5 L/min and 2.2 L/min/m2 respectively.
Severe aortic stenois was present with peak-to-peak gradient of 55mmHg and mean gradient of 44 mmHg.
[**Location (un) 109**] was 0.75 cm2.
Left ventriculogram not performed due to elevated creatinine.

[**2124-6-2**] ECHO Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transgastric mid-papillary view shows evidence of hypovolemia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2124-5-24**] for further evaluation of his chest discomfort.
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.5cm2.
A cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed severe three vessel disease in addition to the known severe aortic stenosis.
As he had a large hematoma and a new femoral bruit post catheterization, a femoral ultrasound was obtained which showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.
Mr. [**Known lastname 46217**] preoperative chest x-ray revealed a fullness which was likely a goiter.
A CT scan was performed which showed a multinodular goiter, a trachea which was narrowed to two thirds of its normal diameter at the level of the thyroid, moderate-to-severe emphysema, small hiatal hernia and a probable liver cyst which incompletely assessed.
As Mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] had some renal failure post catheterization, the renal service was consulted and a renal ultrasound was performed.
Atrovent and albuterol were prescribed and pulmonary function testing was planned.
On [**2124-6-1**], Mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three [**Last Name (LF) 56207**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] aortic valve replacement using a 27mm pericardial valve and a total thyroidectomy.
On postoperative day seven, mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
Thyroid studies were repeated and his synthorid was adjusted appropriately.
