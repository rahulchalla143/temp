Admission Date:  [**2120-9-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-9-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-7-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Crestor / Lipitor / Ivp Dye, Iodine Containing / Zocor  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: Elective cardiac catheterization and subsequent right groin pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization and placement of two cypher stents in right coronary artery.
Right groin exploration finding two small punctures in right external iliac artery with subsequent suturing in the operating room.
In [**2119-5-13**] the patient underwent cardiac catheterization for inferior ischemia on stress testing and exertional chest discomfort.
LVEF was noted at 67%.
Repeat angiography revealed widely patent RCA stents and a totally occluded R-PL with collaterals from the left.
Angiography of the other vessels was notable for a 50% mid LAD and a 40% proximal Cx.
She subsequently underwent stress testing and developed [**6-20**] chest pain and 1.5mm inferolateral ST depression with exercise.
Cardiolite imaging was notable for a dilated LV cavity at stress consistent with exercise associated LV dysfunction.
LVEF was noted at 68%.
On [**9-26**] cardiac cath showed an RCA with 80% ostial stenosis with a 70% in-stent restenosis.
Blood pressure responsed (up to 130s systolic) and the dopamine was off by the end of the procedure.
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2119-6-1**] anatomy as follows: --LMCA: without flow limiting disease --LAD: mid 50% calcified LAD lesion --LCx: 40% stenosis before takeoff of the OM1 which was a moderate size vessel without flow limiting disease --RCA: stents were widely patent (three overlapping 2.5 mm Taxus  drug-eluting stents placed [**2119-5-26**]) --Acute marginal: TIMI 2 fast flow --R-PL totally obstructed at its origin, but had collaterals from the LAD.
--Ostial RCA calcified lesion of 60% was further investigated with RADI Pressurewire --FFR changed from 0.95 to 0.85 with maximal hyperemia using IV adenosine indicating a hemodynamically insignificant lesion.
Arthritis 5. s/p thyroidectomy with resulting hypothyroidism 6. s/p c-sections x3 7.
Hard of hearing (wears bilateral hearing aids) 8.
Physical Exam: Blood pressure was 149/70 mm Hg while lying flat.
Pulse was 70 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 12 breaths/min.
Weight 160lbs (73kg).
Height 64 inches.
Her right showed mild erythema of the conjunctiva.
Examination of the heart revealed no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: DP and PT via doppler Left:  Carotid 2+  DP and PT via doppler  Pertinent Results: Coronary Cath ([**2120-9-26**]) COMMENTS: 1)  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel disease.
The LMCA showed mild diffuse disease without angiographic evidence of flow-limiting stenosis.
2)  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressures with an aortic systolic pressure of 130mmHg and an aortic diastolic pressure of 67 mmHg.
Left ventriculography was deferred.of 130mm 4.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI grade III flow in the 5.
Chest X-Ray ([**2120-9-26**]) IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process with appropriately positioned central venous catheter and no pneumothorax.
ECG ([**2120-9-26**]) Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2119-5-27**] no significant diagnostic change.
