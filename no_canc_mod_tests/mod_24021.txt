The [**2146-7-30**] CT scan showed a strut graft in this location, though this is not well demonstrated radiographically (likely due to technique and overlying structures).
On the AP view, some air projects to the right of the cervical spine, but this may also lie within the piriformis recess.
Marked prevertebral soft tissue swelling, more than on the CT scan of [**2146-7-30**].

AP and lateral radiographs of the cervical spine demonstrate a soft tissue swelling.
COMPARISON: Comparison is made to CT of the cervical spine from [**2146-7-30**].
TECHNIQUE: CT of the neck was obtained without and with IV contrast.
Nonionic IV contrast was used due to rapid bolus necessary for this study.
The appearance of the hardware is unchanged from the CT of the cervical spine of [**2146-7-30**] is unchanged.
Examination of the lung apices demonstrated bilateral large pleural effusions and septal thickening which is suggestive of CHF/fluid overload.
Fluid collection the prevertebral space anterior to the C2 and C3 is new when compared to CT of the c-spine from [**2146-7-30**].
