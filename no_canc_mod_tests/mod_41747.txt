Estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2).
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Elevated intracardiac filling pressures and low cardiac index  Other diagnostics: Chest xray [**2128-7-24**] [**Hospital1 18**] As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
CARDIAC PERFUSION PERSANTINE [**2128-7-28**]  [**Hospital1 18**] 1.
[**7-25**] CT Abdomen with contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
EKG:[**2128-7-30**] Atrial fibrillation with mean rate of 82 beats per minute.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-7-22**] the rhythm is now atrial fibrillation which is being tracked by the pacemaker.
Troponins were not elevated at OSH making another acute ischemic event less likely, however given no history of cath but + history of inferior-posterior MI, it was unclear whether the exacerbation was due to an ischemic event.
The coumadin was held (as was heparin gtt) upon admission due to suspicion of a splenic hematoma on OSH CT scan (see below).
After stabilization of her splenic hematoma a heparin gtt was initiated with PTT goal of 50-70.
As a complicaton there was a minor left ventricular perforation at the time of the left ventricular lead implant which was oversewn.
Heparin was restarted after surgery with goal PTT 50-70.
She was also on keflex for total of 5 days after her BiV placement.
#Splenic Infarct: CT at OSH showed suspected splenic infarct vs. hematoma.
Repeat CT w/ contrast here confirmed the suspicion and showed increasing size of lesion.
After rescrutinization of the CT scans, surgery thought patient might benefit from embolization therapy.
We trended her hematocrits every 6 hours and got another repeat CT scan which showed stable blood counts and no interval change in hematoma.
Etiology of spleic infarct and hemhorragic conerversion werent clear however it is likely patient through a clot from her A-fib which caused splenic infarct then led to hemhorragic conversion.
CT surgery recommended we restart anticoagulation because of her Afib and we put her back on heparin drip with goal PTT 50-60.
She has refused cardiac catheterization in the past.
She underwent a viability study on [**7-27**] which showed Severe resting perfusion defect of the apex, entire distal ventricle and entire mid ventricle, indicating low probability of recovery of function of these segments after revascularization.
On [**7-28**] we got cardiac perfusion persantine showing fixed, severe, very large perfusion defect involving the LAD territory and Increased left ventricular cavity size.
A C.Diff assay came back positive, and the patient was treated with Metronidazole in house.
Given her exposure to contrast on the first CT abdomen in house, contrast nephropathy was the likely culprit for her [**Last Name (un) **] though pre-renal CHF was also likely a cause.
She was treated with supportive therapy including titration of BP meds and strict monitoring of her I/Os.
Her Cr was at 1.4 at time of admission.
