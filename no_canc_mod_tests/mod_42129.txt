CT head shows old infarct on the left that would not explain symptoms.
His HCTZ was doubled to 25mg PO Daily and Irbesartan was doubled to 300mg PO Daily.
SKIN: Square areas of erythema where previous EKG tags had been  LYMPH: No cervical LAD.
NEURO: Awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**4-10**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, cerebellar exam intact, gait deferred.

If clinically indicated, MRI could be considered for further evaluation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Intermediate density right renal lesion in the left lower pole with some heterogeneity is concerning for a renal neoplasm and correlation with prior imaging if available is recommended and if not, further assessment can be performed with ultrasound.
CTA revealed incidental renal lesion concerning for neoplasm.
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  # Renal Lesions: Patient has multiple hypodense renal lesions that were reportedly not noted on imaging during his admission in late [**2149**].
Patient could have neuroendocrine tumor secreting renin resulting in refractory hypertension, but this would likely result in persistent resistent hypertension over a period of time and this patient had an acute episode as he measures his BP daily and his SBP is always between 140-150s.
Pt has no evidence of Renal artery stenosis on imaging here or at OSH in [**State 2690**].
