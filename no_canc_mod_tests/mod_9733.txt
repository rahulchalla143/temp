In this setting she presented to [**Hospital 46148**] Hospital on [**1-30**] with complaints of increasing shortness of breath.
Her initial chest x-rays at the outside hospital revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates concerning for adult respiratory distress syndrome versus bilateral pneumonias due to severe aspiration.
By report, her echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function.
The patient underwent a chest computerized tomography scan on [**2-11**] which revealed diffuse bilateral interstitial lung disease with subpleural bronchiectasis with a diffuse reticular nodular pattern.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation management of her bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, question acute and chronic pulmonary disease of unclear etiology.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission temperature 99, heartrate 66, blood pressure 107/70, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 96%.
LABORATORY DATA:  Arterial blood gases, 7.41, pACO2 46, pAO2 72, on FIO2 of 65% with positive end-expiratory pressure of 15.
White count 17.3, hematocrit 37, platelets 272.
Chem-7 sodium 139, potassium 4, chloride 97, bicarbonate 28, BUN 16, creatinine 0.3, glucose 117, normal coagulation studies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Fennard Intensive Care Unit on [**2-17**] for further evaluation and management of her diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrate and persistent hypoxemia.
The patient's initial chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with bibasilar ill-defined pulmonary infiltrate.
Given that the patient had received greater than 14 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics at the outside hospital the decision was made to withhold any antibiotic treatment until sputum cultures were revealing of an infectious etiology.
Given that her open lung biopsy had revealed diffuse alveolar damage, consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary edema, the patient was placed on midury protocol for treatment of late stage adult respiratory distress syndrome with tapering dose of Solu-Medrol.
The patient continued, however, to have high ventilatory support requirement with positive end-expiratory pressure no less than 12.5 and FIO2 no less than 50%.
With decreasing positive end-expiratory pressure and FIO2 the patient immediately dropped oxygen saturation to the low 80s with pAO2s in the 60s.
A repeat chest computerized tomography scan was obtained on [**2177-3-4**] which revealed diffuse patchy areas of groundglass opacification and consolidation.
The computerized tomography scan was felt to be consistent with diffuse alveolar damage/pulmonary edema in a patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome.
At the time of [**Year (4 digits) **], the patient has ventilatory settings of pressure support 15 with positive end-expiratory pressure of 12.5, FIO2 40 to 50%.
In this setting her minute ventilation was 10-12 liters per minute with a title volume of 4 to 600.
