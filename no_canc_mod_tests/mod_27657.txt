Increased mean transit time is visualized on the perfusion images along the superior margin of this area, also supportive of recent ischemia and/or infarction.
[**2154-11-6**] ECHO The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
No other significant new abnormalities since the previous CT of [**2154-11-5**].
[**2154-11-11**] MRI head: IMPRESSION: Acute infarcts of the left frontal lobe and insula not significantly changed in extent compared to CT scans.
[**2154-11-7**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 129.
Compared to previous tracing cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation.
On [**2154-11-6**] the patient had new onset afib with rapid ventricular response (HR to 156) and blood pressures dropping into the low 100s.
The patient was transferred to the ICU so that pressors could be hung as we were concerned that her low blood pressure might put her at further risk for ischemic injury in the setting of her recent stroke.
The patient was placed on Neo-Synephrine to maintain systolic blood pressure over 120.
She was also started on a diltiazem drip to facilitate rate control, but this was felt not to be ideal as the blood pressure effects of the diltiazem was counteracting the effects of the Neo-Synephrine.
Regarding the patient's stroke, this was seen both in the CTA perfusion performed on the day of admission and in the MRI performed on [**11-11**].
An ECHO did not demonstrate a cardiac source for the embolus.
A hemoglobin A1C was 4.8.
The total cholesterol was 173 and the LDL fraction was 82.
A urine culture was positive for E.coli and Stenotrophomonas.
Her repeat UA was negative.
The patient was noted to be increasingly anemic with a HCT of 27.4 on [**2154-11-12**] from 38.4 on admission.
She therefore had an IR guided thoracentesis which showed a transudate, with negative gram stain and culture.
Her INR on discharge was 2.1 and she was on Coumadin.
Her LDL should be maintained less than 70 and HbA1c less than 7.
