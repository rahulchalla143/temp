TECHNIQUE: 8-MDCT axial images of the head were obtained without IV contrast:  FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, major vascular territorial infarcts.
The conventional images show a large area of mixed T1 and T2 signal within the right occipital and temporal lobes, consistent with a chronic infarction.
Further evaluation of this finding could be achievable with gadolinium enhanced MR.
[**3-6**] chest x-ray: PORTABLE CHEST, ONE VIEW: There are no prior studies available for comparison at this time.
[**3-9**] chest x-ray: AP BEDSIDE CHEST: The cardiac silhouette is prominent even allowing for semi-erect position.
Since similar suboptimal bedside exam 2 days ago, the left lower lobe process has developed or increased.
These assessments limited by bedside semi-erect positioning  [**3-15**] bilateral carotid dopplers: FINDINGS: There is minimal scattered calcific plaque involving both carotid systems.
The peak systolic velocities are normal as are the ICA to CCA ratios.

His head CT and MRI ruled out acute bleed or new stroke.
He was placed on standing Valium and tight CIWA scale.
His BP continued to be elevated up to 220's.
His high BP was thought to be from withdrawl, but persisted even after his withdrawl was adequately treated with Valium and when pt is at rest without agitation.
Clindamycin was started on [**3-8**], and levofloxacin was added on [**3-10**] after sputum cx grew GNR.
Patient had an EEG which demonstrated no seizure activity on [**3-13**].
Patient had MRI which showed no sign of an acute infarct.
Head CT showed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage but demonstrated chronic infarct in the right occipital region.
Bilateral carotid doppler ultrasounds demonstrated no abnormalities with normal flow.
Alcoholic ketosis: Pt has history of DMII and was admitted with hyperglycemia, anion gap of 17 and glucose and ketones in urine, concerning for early DKA vs. alcoholic ketosis.
Cardiovascular: a)Patient ruled out for MI; EKG without concerning changes, cardiac enzymes cycled, troponin with slight elevation but felt likely secondary to demand, remained flat.
Ace inhibition, beta-blockade and calcium channel blockers titrated up to maintain SBP<140 with good affect on current regimen.
Full code throughout admission, DVT and Gi prophlaxis maintained with subcutaneous heparin and protonix.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure  Secondary: 2) Alcohol Abuse - Continuous 3) Aspiration Pneumonia 4) History of CVA in past, abnormal MRI 5) Hypertension 6) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: Take all medications as prescribed.
The MRI you had here on admission was abnormal and showed evidence of an old stroke.
Your repeat MRI should be performed with GADOLINIUM.
3) Have a repeat chest x-ray in 6 weeks to ensure your pneumonia has cleared.
