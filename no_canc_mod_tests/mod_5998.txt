The patient presented to the Emergency Department where a computed tomography scan showed multiple brain lesions confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging.
Culture and sensitivity profile demonstrated an increased white blood cell count and red blood count with 98% polys.
A repeat computed tomography scan showed a 6-cm X 5-cm right posterior frontoparietal intracranial hemorrhage with mass affect.
He creatine phosphokinases and MB fractions sent which were positive.

On [**5-27**], the patient had a repeat head computed tomography which showed no significant change from the head computed tomography done on [**5-25**].
A chest x-ray showed no evidence of infiltrate.
A computed tomography on [**6-1**] showed no significant change.
For the patient's condition, the patient had an emergent transesophageal echocardiogram for worsening blood pressure control and temperatures to 103.9.
Transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed an abscess of the aortic root, moderate mitral regurgitation, severe aortic regurgitation, large pericardial effusion.
