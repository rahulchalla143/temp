His RIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA and SVG-OM2 were all patent.
History also significant for CHF with an an EF of 25% s/p cardiac resynchronization and biventricular pacemaker placement, hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
The tightness was across his chest with no radiation.
Well healed bilateral scars Pulses: 1+ distally Neuro: Alert and oriented, CN 2- 12 grossly intact, no focal deficits noted  Pertinent Results: [**2132-11-20**] 11:05PM BLOOD WBC-7.8 RBC-3.90* Hgb-11.9*# Hct-35.5* MCV-91 MCH-30.4 MCHC-33.4 RDW-15.6* Plt Ct-212 [**2132-11-20**] 11:05PM BLOOD PT-17.3* PTT-39.2* INR(PT)-1.6* [**2132-11-20**] 11:05PM BLOOD Glucose-178* UreaN-25* Creat-1.4* Na-140 K-4.1 Cl-98 HCO3-31 AnGap-15 [**2132-11-20**] 11:05PM BLOOD CK-MB-NotDone cTropnT-0.02* [**2132-11-22**] 09:30AM BLOOD Triglyc-78 HDL-33 CHOL/HD-5.3 LDLcalc-125 LDLmeas-129 [**2132-11-21**] 06:00AM BLOOD TSH-2.2 [**2132-11-20**] 11:05PM BLOOD Digoxin-2.0 [**2132-11-21**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Arterial conduit angiography of the RIMA to LAD showed the graft to be widely patent.
Bypass graft angiography shows that the SVG to PDA that was patent in [**2129**] is now proximally occluded.
[**2132-11-25**] Chest CT Scan: 1.

Cardiac surgery was consulted and extensive preoperative evaluation was performed.
An echocardiogram revealed substantial increase in aortic stenosis and pulmonary pressures, while left ventricular function and the severity of mitral regurgitation appeared similar in comparison to [**2129**] - see result section for additional details.
Cardiac catheterization was performed which showed patent RIMA to LAD and patent vein graft to obtuse marginal.
Additional preoperative workup included chest CT scan and carotid non invasive studies - see result section.
He was also cleared by the dental service after clinical and radiographic examinations showed no obvious infection.
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5.
At discharge, his BP was 96/50 with a HR of 71.
His oxygen saturations were 95% on room air and the discharge chest x-ray showing a slight element of fluid overload.
