--------- HEAD CT [**12-20**]: There is no change in the left basal ganglia bleed, which extends into the centrum semiovale superiorly and has surrounding vasogenic edema.
--------- CT head [**2182-1-9**]: IMPRESSION: Since [**2182-1-2**], minimal decrease in size of the hyperdense component of the left basal ganglia/centrum semiovale hemorrhage but with minimal worsening of the surrounding edema which is causing minimal worsening of the left to right shift of the normally midline structures, now measuring approximately 7 mm.
----- CT head ([**2182-2-2**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Hypoattenuation without evidence of acute hemorrhage in the region of old intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left basal ganglia/centrum semiovale ----- CT head ([**2182-2-27**]): IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhages.
----- CT head ([**2182-3-5**]): IMPRESSION: No short interval change.
----- CT head ([**2182-3-13**]): CONCLUSION: No interval change in the appearances of the ventricular system post-stent placement.
For further details, see speech and swallow evaluation from the same date.
=============== ECHO [**2181-12-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
======================== EEG [**2181-12-24**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganized, low voltage, and slow background consistent with a marked/severe  encephalopathy which suggests dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, infection, and anoxia are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
---- EEG ([**2182-3-9**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to an intermittent asymmetry between the two hemispheres, with loss of faster frequencies and more prominent delta slowing noted broadly over the left side.
----- EEG ([**2182-3-14**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the low voltage fast and disorganized background with intermittent bursts of moderate  amplitude generalized mixed frequency slowing consistent with a mild encephalopathy suggesting dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.
A CTA showed no vascular abnormalities.
His blood pressure was initially maintained between 120-170 with a MAP of less than 130.
His blood pressure was somewhat difficult to control requiring metoprolol 100 TID, lisinopril 40mg daily, norvasc 10mg daily and HCTZ 25mg daily.
His LDL and A1c were checked and were WNL.
- sustained clonus was noted on multiple occasions on the right side and occasionally misinterpreted as seizure activity, but this was then followed by some reports of facial twitching and an EEG was obtained.
The EEG was not suggestive of epileptiform activity, but due to increasing somnolence (thought to be in part related to depression from being in the hospital for so long)that could have been related to seizure activity (that might be too deep to have been picked up by EEG), the decision was made to start him on Keppra.
He passed his speech and swallow study and was then started on PO feeds.
Etiology of this was not well known, and further workup included a renal ultrasound in order to rule out renal artery stenosis (found to be negative).
