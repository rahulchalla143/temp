HOSPITAL COURSE:  Blood pressure was controlled with a Labetalol drip and following TPA, Mr. [**Known lastname 54239**] actually did well.
He was taken emergently for an angiogram that showed a 99% right ICA stenosis.
The angiogram also showed ICA to ECA collateralization and a large (5 cm) AAA.
A follow-up CT scan was obtained to evaluate the abdominal aortic aneurysm which showed that it was stable without dissection, which is the final read.
In addition, a transesophageal echocardiogram was considered, but since Vascular Surgery requested no anti-coagulation on the patient, no change in therapy would result from getting the test so we deferred the transesophageal echocardiogram.
The patient's head was put down to flat and he was given intravenous hydration.
twice a day; hold for systolic blood pressure of less than 140.
