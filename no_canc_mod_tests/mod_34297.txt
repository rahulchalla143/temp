TECHNIQUE: Axial volumetric images have been obtained through the abdomen and pelvis according to the triphasic liver protocol.
He continued to spike fevers with elevated white count, and his cultures grew out strep viridans from the pleural fluid and yeast from sputum.
Echo was done which was negative for vegetations, and all lines were changed.
On [**1-25**] he had a CT of the abdomen/pelvis to rule out intraabdominal source, which revealed a fluid collection below his thoracotomy wound, so the incision was opened.
All subsequent cultures were negative.
