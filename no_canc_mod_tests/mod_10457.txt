In the Emergency Department she was found to be in atrial fibrillation and on chest x-ray had bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
On [**1-17**] she spiked a fever and a chest x-ray demonstrated pneumonia.
Chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions right greater then left and a left lower lobe consolidation.
On [**1-28**] te patient demonstrated worsening respiratory distress and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Pulse tachycardic at 111.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6.4, hematocrit 32.2, creatinine 0.7, INR 1.1, CK 33, troponin 0.5.
Electrocardiogram demonstrates atrial fibrillation with a rate of 165.
No ST or T wave changes and chest x-ray with bilateral effusions right greater then left.
She had been evaluated and prepared for thoracentesis of her bilateral pleural effusions, which are felt most likely secondary to her congestive heart failure, although also possibilities include a peripneumonia effusion.
Over the course of the day she went from oxygen saturations of the 90s on 4 liters to requirement of 100% nonrebreather with saturations dropping into the mid 80s.
A chest x-ray on the floor demonstrated continued bilateral pleural effusions, stable congestive heart failure and worsening left lower lobe infiltrate.
She was administered 40 mg of intravenous Lasix with urine output of 1200 cc.
Echocardiogram demonstrated an EF of greater then 55% with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5660**] dilated.
The patient continues to have good urine output and to hold good blood pressures.
The patient had a bedside swallow test on [**1-27**] for which she failed clear liquids.
A video oropharyngeal swallow study was initiated on [**1-30**] and at that point she again failed clear fluids, but she can have thickened solids and nectar consistency liquids.
Leni's were negative, but will perform CT angiogram today to rule out PE.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Again the patient failed clear liquids, but will continue nectar substance liquids as well as pureed thickened solids.
