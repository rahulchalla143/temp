A pelvic film was without fracture.
A CT scan of the head obtained at an outside hospital was unremarkable.
CT scan of the cervical spine demonstrated left transverse process fractures of C7 and T1.

His electrolytes were unremarkable.
An initial blood gas showed a pH of 7.13 with clear hypercarbia with a pCO2 of 58.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Because of the patient's relative hemodynamic instability, the free fluid on CT scan, and the seatbelt sign it was elected to explore him.
Cultures showed gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci.
The white blood count remained 8.
His tachycardia - which was persistent - was felt potentially contributable to a cardiac contusion, although there was never any clear evidence of this.
