If clinically indicated, a transesophageal study will better assess valvular morphology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-1-12**], stenotic aortic valve has been replaced with a mechanical prosthesis.
CXR 9.19 1.
CT Chest [**9-11**] IMPRESSION: 1.
He was admitted to the MICU where his BP stablized with fluid resucitation.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were started with Vancomycin and Zosyn and blood / urine cultures were drawn.
On [**9-10**], antibiotics were discontinued as patient had been afebrile since admission with normalizing white counts and clinical picture clear for exacerbation of CHF.
His symptoms seemed subacute and progressive over past few months and likely made worse by volume resuscitation in the ED.
Echo was performed which showed severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD, normal-functioning mechanical aortic valve prosthesis, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension and no vegetations seen.
His coumadin was then increased to his normal home dose and his INR began to increase.
On [**9-16**] his INR was 1.8, still in the subtherapeutic range, but the patient decided that he could not wait for this to resolve.
He was also instructed to get his INR checked on [**9-18**] and these results made known to his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 95337**] who was informed about this.
# Loculated pleural effusion: Patient was found to have a loculated effusion on CXR and the result confirmed by CT chest.
A thoracentesis was done to drain the fluid and send if for analysis.
Cytology was done and it revealed atypical cells, many lymphocytes and some enlarged forms.
These cells were sent for further analysis by flow cytometry which was pending upon discharge.
He was given a prescription to repeat CT chest in 5 weeks to evaluate for continued resolution or re accumulation of the pleural effusion.
CT Chest Please obtain CT Chest to evaluate for resolution/reaccumulation of loculated pleural effusion, any day on the week of [**2157-10-31**].
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on [**2157-9-19**].
This was drained by a thoracentesis, and the fluid was sent off for cytology.
Your INR is still currently sub-therapeutic at 1.8.
You have decided that you do not want to stay in the hospital to wait for your INR to increase.
We medically advised you to stay in the hospital until your INR is 2.5, and we explained to you that leaving the hospital with your current INR is dangerous because you can develop blood clots that can cause a stroke or your mechanical valve to malfunction, requiring surgical repair.
You will need your INR checked on Sunday [**2157-9-19**] to make sure it is increasing.
We started you on Lovenox to protect you from stroke until your INR is 2.0-3.0.
Phone number: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 88550**]  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] (Vascular surgery).
Someone from his office will call you on [**2157-9-19**] to schedule you for a non-invasive study of the blood vessels in you leg prior to you appointment.
Date/Time: [**2157-9-22**] at 10 am.
