Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data The  post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions: PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Left ventricular  wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left kidney demonstrates a 9 x 7 x 7 mm exophytic hypoechogenic focus that likely represents a complex cyst.
Doppler evaluation of the kidneys demonstrates symmetric blood flow throughout either kidneys.
DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17726**]     Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-26**] for cardiac surgery.
A repeat creat check noted an elevated Cr to 2.6,and a renal consult was called.
On POD3 the creat continued to rise but the patient otherwise continued to make post-operative progress and his epicardial wires were removed, as were his mediastinal chest tubes.
His creatinine dropped to 2.3.
