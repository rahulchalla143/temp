HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and transient ischemic attacks who had a cardiac catheterization on [**2163-12-20**], after developing dyspnea.
The cardiac catheterization was significant for diffuse disease in the small obtuse marginal 2 and 90% stenosis of the mid and distal right coronary artery and moderate aortic stenosis.
On [**2164-1-26**], she had an echocardiogram which showed left ventricular hypertrophy, inferior basal hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 55%, mild mitral stenosis and mitral valve orifice of 2 by 2 cm, moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 45 and an aortic valve of .9 cm by 2 cm and [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement.
On [**2164-9-28**], she underwent an exercise tolerance test which was positive.
On [**2165-2-6**] she underwent a cardiac catheterization and was found to have two vessel disease.
The obtuse marginal 1 branch was occluded and the obtuse marginal 2 and obtuse marginal 2 branches were small vessels.
It was also found that she had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 46%.
Following this cardiac catheterization the patient was evaluated by the Cardiothoracic Service and now she presents to [**Hospital6 1760**] for definitive therapy.
Temperature is 98.5, pulse 55, blood pressure 125/51, she is sating 93% on room air.
Glucose is 306.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission includes white count 7, hematocrit 50.1, platelets 215, sodium 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 99, bicarbonate 28, BUN 40, creatinine 1.5 and glucose of 263.
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 59 with first degree atrioventricular block.
The chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions, no pulmonary vascular congestions to suggest heart failure.
She transferred to the Surgery Intensive Care Unit with mean arterial pressure of 65, CP of 12, being A-V paced and on Neosynephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.
Her blood pressure remained stable.
She was given 1 unit of blood for a hematocrit of 26.
She was given colloid Hespan for low urine output which showed no improvement.
The Dopamine began to improve her hemodynamics and urine output.
On postoperative day #5 she had another episode of atrial flutter with a rate of 70 and blood pressure of 153/82.
On the same postoperative days, the patient developed wheezing with oxygen saturations in the 90s on 4 liters of nasal cannula.
Pulmonary consultation was obtained and working with them the patient received chest x-ray which showed large left pleural effusion.
Samples were sent for culture and staining.
The patient's oxygen saturations increased to 99% on 2 liters.
