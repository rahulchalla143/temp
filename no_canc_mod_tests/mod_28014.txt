He continued to have trouble with his nose, with repeated epistaxis and difficulty breathing through his nose, and presented again to [**Hospital1 5979**] on the day prior to this admission, at which time his nose was re-packed, and he returned home.
At [**Hospital3 **] this morning, he was tachycardic to 110, and appears to have had BP as low as 80s systolic.
Labs were notable for a hematocrit of 23, INR 1.8.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care as no ICU beds were available there.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%), but there is no resting outflow tract obstruction.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15)  suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
EGD [**2185-11-17**]: Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (ligation) [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear Normal mucosa in the stomach Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: serial hematocrits [**Hospital1 **] proton pump inhibitor Keep intubated Contact liver team immediatly for recurrent bleeding for consideration of repeat EGD vs [**Last Name (un) 10045**] tube placement, vs tips  Additional notes: The attending was present for the entire procedure.
EGD [**11-18**] :Findings: Esophagus:  Contents: Red blood was seen in the upper third of the esophagus extending into the stomach.
[**2185-11-27**]: RUQ U/S: Slightly distended gallbladder filled with stones and sludge, and a positive son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.
HIDA scan is recommended for further evaluation of gallbladder function.
[**2185-11-27**]: HIDA: Serial images over the abdomen show appropriate uptake of tracer into the hepatic parenchyma.
gm stain negative Blood cx: NGTD  Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old male with history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, 2 prior episodes of hematemesis, presenting with hematemesis and hematocrit drop in the setting of recent nose trauma and epistaxis, as well as evidence of hepatic failure on labs.
The patient was intubated and GI performed an EGD immediately, which demonstrated 3 cords of varices with bleeding which were banded.
His hematocrit was stable after the first 24 hours of his hospitalization.
The patient was kept intubated until his hematocrit had been demonstrated to be stable, however it took an extra couple of days for the sedation to wear off, attributed to poor clearance by the liver.
Recheck showed a hct of 26 and his stool was notably guaiac negative.
In terms of the spironolactone, he has some peripheral edema which is improved with spironolactone but occasionally his systolic bp was below 90 so this medication was held.
He had a nasal balloon that was placed at OSH and was removed by ENT on [**11-18**].
A RUQ ultrasound and HIDA scan were concerning for acute cholecystitis.
