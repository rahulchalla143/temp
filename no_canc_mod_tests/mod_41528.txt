Cardiovascular:  S1, S2, tachycardic, II/IV systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal base.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 6.2, hematocrit 47, platelets 278, neutrophils 61, lymphocytes 23, monocytes 13, eosinophils 1.5, basophils 0.7.
Coagulation studies, PT 13.3, PTT 30.9, INR at 1.2.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 95, carbon dioxide 34, BUN 14, creatinine 2.9, glucose 194.
CK 136, MB 8, troponin less than 0.3.
Chest x-ray showed blunting of left costophrenic angle, hyper-inflated lung fields.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia of 115, left atrial enlargement, extreme rightward axis, new compared to [**1-/2138**], which had normal axis.
With known history, the patient got an echocardiogram that showed ejection fraction of 20 to 30%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular cavity markedly dilated, and abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure volume overload, mild aortic regurgitation, severe four plus tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonic valve leaflets were thickened and end-diastolic regurgitation capacity was increased, suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
The patient was gassed and found to have arterial blood gases with pH of 7.19, pO2 64, pCO2 of 113.
The patient was then reversed with Limasonil and regassed and still had a pH of 7.22, pCO2 of 106, and pO2 of 66.
The patient's pulmonary status continued to improve while on the Medicine Floor, however, his oxygen requirements were consistent and the patient required nasal cannula to keep his O2 saturations between 90 and 93%.
A CT scan of his chest was originally done to rule out pulmonary embolism and it was noted that the patient had multiple soft tissue infiltrates in the mediastinum.
The patient had a follow-up MRI which showed that there was confluent soft tissue within the mediastinum and the paratracheal aorta pulmonary window and subcarinal regions.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was placed on levofloxacin 500 mg q. day secondary to original chest x-ray being read in the Emergency Room as inconclusive as to whether or not the patient had a consolidative pneumonia.
He is requiring oxygen to maintain his saturations between 90 and 94%.
twice a day; hold for heart rate less than 60 or systolic blood pressure less than 100.
