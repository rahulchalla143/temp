CT HEAD post-opeartion: Status post partial evacuation of left subdural collection via left burr holes, with expected postoperative changes and with decreased mass efect on the subjacent left frontoparietal brain and the left lateral ventricles.
The remainder of his exam is stable.
Given the recurrence of his symptoms for over an hour, seizure is less likely and there was more concern of the mass effect from his SDH hence he was evaluated per neurosurgery.
Post-op imaging showed expected post surgical changes.
The patient/family have been recommended to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 9034**] office to schedule a follow-up appt in 4 weeks with repeat CT of head without contrast.
During this admission, his blood pressure consistently remained > 150 hence his atenolol has been increased to 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Hospital1 **]: [**1-22**]  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.

Although transient, given the duration of the deficit and its recurrence plus the CT of head showing some mass effect from the subdural hemorrhage, you underwent the evaucation per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2190-2-17**] without complications.
You will get a repeat head CT before the appointment.
