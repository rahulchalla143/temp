Given this she underwent an TTE on [**2-10**] showing concentric LVH, nl cavity and size w/ septal hypokinesis and paradoxical septal motion (?
Persantine on [**2166-2-26**] showed diminshed flow to anterior wall (mostly at septum) which improved at rest.
Cath showed 70% LAD w/ normal LMCA, LCX and RCA.
LVEDP of 15 mmHg and EF 55%.
Six kids, 3 sons and 3 daughters, all healthy.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 10 cm.

The LMCA, LCx and RCA were all free of angiographically apparent, flow-limiting disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed [**Month/Day/Year 1192**] systemic arterial systolic hypertension 185/95 mmHg.
Left ventriculography revealed mild anterior hypokinesis.
LVEF was calculated at 55%.
Final angiogram showed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow.

Overnight her BP and HCT were stable.
On coumadin prior to PCI but not restarted per her Cardiologist.
