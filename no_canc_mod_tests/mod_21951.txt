Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: OPERATION PERFORMED: Exploratory laparotomy with packing of liver and drainage of retroperitoneal injury  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gunshot wound to abdomen with hemoperitoneum, with left hepatic lobe laceration.
A chest x-ray furnished from the outside hospital showed the absence of a pneumothorax.
We prepped the abdomen, chest and groin as a single field with Betadine and sterilely draped.
Pneumatic compression boots were applied.
I did not feel that further exploration was warranted.
After assuring that our sponge, needle and instrument count were correct, we then closed the rectus fascia with a running number 2, looped PDS suture.
Physical Exam: A full physical exam was not performed in the ED secondary to the patient's questionable hemodynamic status and the determination to emergently transfer directly to the OR for exploratory laparotomy.
