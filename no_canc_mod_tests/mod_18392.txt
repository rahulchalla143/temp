Cardiac Catheterization 2.
Initial EKG had some non-specific ST changes concerning for NSTEMI and EF per ECHO (TTE) done at OSH noted to be 15%.
She was also given a loading dose of Plavix 600mg in the ER and 75mg the following morning and she was started on both Integrillin and Heparin and was transferred directly to the cardiac catheterization lab at [**Hospital1 18**] and found to not have any obstructive coronary disease, LV-gram showing EF closer to 30% but prominent apical ballooning consistent with Takotsubo's Cardiomyopathy presentation.
She was able to be slowly weaned off of Neosynephrine and BP was 115/70 upon presentation to the CCU.

LV gram showing some MR, EF 30%, bases intact, severe hypokinesis of anterolateral, apical and inferior walls, bedside echo without pericardial effusion, no LVOT gradient, depressed EF.

[**2139-11-5**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall; there is extensive apical akinesis with focal dyskinesi..
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-11-5**], the findings are similar.

Initial EKG had some non-specific ST changes concerning for NSTEMI with possible cardiogenic shock given EF per ECHO report at OSH noted to be 15%.
Repeat ECHO and cardiac catheterization of [**Hospital1 18**] showed findings consistent with Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy and very scant evidence of coronary artery disease.
CARDIAC PUMP FUNCTION /TAKOTSUBO CARDIOMYOPATHY: The patient's heart had classic apical ballooning on ECHO and typical presentation of Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy.
Repeat ECHO [**2139-11-5**] showing LVEF 30% (at OSH EF 15%).
Upon CCU arrival the patient's blood pressure had been challenged in the setting of a recent post-catheterization arterial bleed as noted below.
However, she had been resuscitated with over 5L IVFs and given 4 Units Blood throughout the day leading up to CCU transfer and her BP had stabilized to SBPs in the 90s range.
An A-line was placed for more accurate hemodynamic monitoring and the patient had been weaned off of her pressors prior to CCU presentation.
Fentanyl and Versed were weaned down and RSBIs were in 50 range.
On [**2139-11-7**] repeat ECHO was largely unchanged and EF still 30%.
Moreover, the data on anticoagulation and thrombus/stroke reduction rates in Takotsubo population is lacking and no clear recommendations exist.
Additional cardiomyopathy etiologies were explored which included a work-up sent off for TSH, lipid profile and iron studies (hemochromatosis).
Iron Saturation level was 63%, however in setting of acute event iron studies were felt to be unreliable.
Given that Mrs. [**Known lastname 75808**] has no past medical history of diabetes (HgAIC 5.5)and limited PMH in general hemochromatosis is unlikely but she was encouraged to discuss repeat iron studies at a later date with her PCP as an outpatient.
Once the patient's blood pressure and hematocrits had stabilized she was placed on additional 25mg daily Toprol XL and her home dose of 5mg Lisinopril was restarted.
She will plan for a repeat ECHO in [**3-24**] weeks and a follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
CORONARIES: The patient had very minimal CAD on cardiac catheterization with 20% LAD and mild 25% RCA plaques.
The patient's minimal bump in cardiac enzymes (CK 180-190 range, Troponin peak of 0.60) was attributed to mild ischemia/microvascular stress in setting oh her Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
She will plan to have a repeat lipid panel as an outpatient.
RHYTHM: The patient was monitored on telemetry and daily EKGs were performed during her CCU stay.
She had an initial Hct drop from 34 to 20 which stabilized after 4 Units of blood and over 6 liters of IVF resuscitation.
The patient's Hct levels were checked q6hrs post-surgery and then twice daily as her Hct stabilized.
At time of discharge her Hct was 29.6 and she had no residual right groin pain and minimal discomfort with walking.
THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Post-operatively the patient had some lasting thombocytopenia with platelets in the 70-80s range at the nadir.
DIC workup was unrevealing and given the timeline HIT was felt to be a less likely culprit.
LEUKOCYTOSIS: The patient had a spike to a white blood cell count of 17.9 with neutrophilia but no left shift.
She had no febrile patterns, UA and urine cultures were negative and her CXR had no consolidations.
HYPERTENSION: Initially, the patient's blood pressures were in the hypotensive range and all blood pressure medications were held.
Upon discharge, she was set up for a repeat echo in a few weeks and follow-up appointments with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the vascular surgery clinic.
Medications on Admission: Heparin drip and Integrilin started [**11-4**] but discontinued in setting of acute bleed on [**11-5**] (off both at CCU transfer time) -plavix 600mg [**11-4**], 75mg [**11-5**] -lopressor 25mg po .
You will need to have an ECHO in 3 weeks that will evaluate the function of your heart.
You have to come in on [**11-30**] at 3 p.m. for an echocardiogram which is an ultrasound of your heart, this is also on [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] [**Location (un) 436**].
