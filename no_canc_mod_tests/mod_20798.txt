The right sacral ala fracture demonstrated by CT scan is not distinctly visible on the current examination due to technical factors.
Her SBP in the trauma bay was initially in the 70s, she was resuscitate with 2L crystallloid, with an improvement to the 90s.
Her CT scan here showed a pelvic hematoma but no signs of continued bleeding or extravasation of contrast.
Her hematacrit was monitored and remained stable in the low 30s.
She was seen by the orthopedics service for her pelvic fractures & the spine service for her Lumbar transverse process fractures.
Repeat Xrays of her pelvis showed stable appearance of her pelvic fractures On HD 6, she was cleared by PT/OT and had much improved pain control.
