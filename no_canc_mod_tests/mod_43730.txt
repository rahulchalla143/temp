Admission Date:  [**2178-3-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-3-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-8-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: chest discomfort and palpitations  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intra aortic balloon pump   History of Present Illness: This is a 60 year old male with prior history of 2 vessel coronary artery disease s/p 5 DES(3 to LAD and 2 to D1 in [**2170**]) who woke up on [**2178-3-11**] with chest discomfort and palpitations.
He presented to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED where he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with heart rates in the 160s.
Given a positive D-dimer, a V/Q scan was ordered in setting of his renal failure, which was negative.
Troponins were negative; EKG revealed LVH and T wave inversions in V4-V6.
Initially was hypoxemic and was placed on non-rebreather and then was weaned to 5-6 L NC with saturations in the mid 90s.
CXR revealed vascular congestion.
In the setting of acute congestive heart failure, a 2D echo was obtained which revealed severe MR, severe elevation of PA pressures (39 mm Hg) and tricuspid regurgitation.
On [**3-12**] he went for right heart catheterization which revealed pulmonary wedge pressures in the 20s, with peak v wave pressure of 40; PA pressures were 40/25, with RVEDP of 15, and RA pressure 20.
Coronary angiography was not performed due to renal failure.

[**2178-3-11**] CXR IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
[**2178-3-12**] ECHO IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and low normal global systolic function.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed two-vessel disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertenstion with a central aortic pressure of 151/105 mmHg.
[**3-17**] ECHO IMPRESSION: Moderate concentric LVH with borderline normal systolic function.
[**3-18**] ECHO IMPRESSION: Spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium and left atrial appendage with probable thrombus in the left atrial appendage.
Ischemic event thought to be unlikely given onset of symptoms > 24 hrs with no troponin or CK elevation; EKG reveals T wave inversions in V4-V6 which are likely in setting of LVH.
On admission he was afterload reduced with IABP/heparin as well as a nitro gtt with goal SBP 140-160s.
On [**3-14**] he developed a fever 100.4 and his IABP was removed on [**3-15**], however he then developed absent right distal pulses and his right foot began to feel numb.
On [**3-16**] he underwent a Cath which showed 90% D1 stenosis, RMCA occlusion, no other significant dz.
However a repeat ECHO on [**3-17**] showed improved MR (2+) with borderline normal EF and surgery was defered.
He was placed on [**Last Name (un) 56812**] drip with goal SBP 140-160, hydralazine PRN.
However, FeUrea of 67% was consistent with ATN in the setting of acute MR and poor renal perfusion.
# Rhythm: pt which Afib >110, his metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg TID and he then required Dilt 90mgQID  Medications on Admission:  Aspirin 81mg daily - Fish Oil 1000mg qod  Discharge Medications: 1. carvedilol 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day for 2 weeks.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check Chem-7, INR on Monday [**3-23**] with results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] 9. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
You received diuretics to remove the fluid and we think you are now at your ideal or "dry" weight which is 146.96lbs.
The atrial fibrillation increases your risk for a stroke so you have been started on coumadin to prevent blood clots.
Coumadin takes 2-4 days to start working and 2-4 days to wear off so you will need to have your coumadin level (INR) checked frequently at first for a goal INR of 2.0-3.0.
Start taking warfarin to prevent blood clots and strokes, your goal warfarin (coumadin) level should be 2.0-3.0.
Start taking Carvedilol to lower your blood pressure and help your heart pump better 7.
Start Hydralazine to lower your blood pressure 8.
Start Omeprazole to protect your stomach from the other medicines  Followup Instructions: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] Date/Time: Thursday [**3-26**] at 1:00 pm Address: [**Hospital Ward Name 516**], [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Center, [**Hospital1 18**], [**Location (un) **], [**Location (un) 102334**] under [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical center garage.
