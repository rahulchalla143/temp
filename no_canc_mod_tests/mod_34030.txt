Cath on [**10-23**] demonstrated coronary arteries without angiographically apparent disease.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, had fever, stool studies confirmed severe sepsis from C.diff requiring pressors.
He demonstated a subsequent improvement in his WBC count to 14.2 on [**11-5**].
Pt HCT dropped from 29 on [**11-7**] to 25 on [**11-9**].
PTT 130.

The left sided filling pressure was normal with a mean PCWP of 12 mmHg.
The systemic arterial pressure was low at 91/57 mmHg.
Left ventriculography was deferred given the patient's reduced GFR.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: IMPRESSION: 1.
Video Swallow [**10-28**] FINDINGS: Bolus control, bolus formation and anterior to posterior tongue movement were moderately reduced, with AP rolling of the oral bolus.
Chin tuck techniques were attempted, but were ineffective in preventing or eliminating aspiration.
TTE [**10-23**] - Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
1)  C. difficle colitis and shock - The patient's initial clinical picture of C. diff colitis, hypotension and CT scan was concerning for toxic megacolon.
Given the patient had a benign abdominal exam no surgical intervention was felt to be necessary.
His dose of vancomycin was increased to 500mg Q6 and he was treated with IVIG once on [**10-30**] in consultation with GI and he has demonstated a subsequent improvement in his WBC count to 5.0 on [**11-13**].
2) Atrial fibrillation with RVR - The patient had multiple episodes of AF with RVR during hospital course, thought to be secondary dehydration inducing tachycardia.
On a later episode, he was limited by blood pressure.
His heart rate has been well controlled on the regimen of digoxin and amiodarone.
His HCT dropped from 29 on [**11-7**] to 25 on [**11-9**].
PTT 130.
Pt underwent LENIS to further assess LLE clot, was found to have complete occlusion L popliteal vein extending into L common femoral; No DVT found in the RLE.
Pt was discussed with IR and an IVC filter placed 8pm on [**2165-11-10**] without dye.
His Hct slowly trended down w/o evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
His hematocrit should be checked daily until stable with blood transfusion thresh-hold at 25%.
4) Myocardial Ischemia - The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath as he was found to have elevated ST segments diffusely.
His cardiac cath demonstrated no flow limiting CAD on [**10-23**].
The EKG changes were thought to be secondary to a fixed lesion that was made evident by the high demands of his septic shock.
Following the patients recovery, further evaluation should be considered for feeding tube placement.
Pulmonary Function Test Please arrange for full PFTs with DLCO done within the next 2 weeks.
