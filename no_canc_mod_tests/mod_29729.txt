Physical Exam: Exam: temp 97.4, BP 139/50, HR 120, R 22, O2 96%RA Gen: Lying in bed, somewhat sleepy but easily arousable, comfortable.

[**11-6**] ABD/PELVIC CT: 1.
Note:  Direct immunofluorescence studies show linear deposition of IgG (2+) and C3 (2+) at the dermal/epidermal junction.
Her hemodynamics remained stable and her lactate trended down and she was quickly transferred to the medical floor.
Her urine culture eventually grew positive for a highly resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumonia.
In addition, abdominal CT scans were performed which did not reveal any anatomic abnormality in the urinary tract or any evidence of pyelonephritis (the suspicion of pyelonephritis seen on the [**11-10**] study was thought to be due to artifact).
Delirium: In the middle of her hospitalization she was noted to become agitated and delirious alternating between becoming quite somnolent and delirious with confusion, agitation, and perseveration.
Evaluation of this included a negative EEG, a negative head CT, a negative CXR, an abdominal CT negative for an intra-abdominal infection, and normal labs (CBC and electrolytes).
In addition repeat urine and blood cultures were negative.
Her blood sugars ranged during her stay depending on her po intake but over the several days preceding her discharge her blood sugars were around 100.
She is also completing a prednisone taper (finished [**2119-11-13**]) which may cause her blood sugars to decrease somewhat.
Bullous pemphigoid: She was seen by the dermatology service while hospitalized and a punch biopsy was consistent with bullous pemphigoid.
