Metallic fragments, pneumocephalus and hemorrhage are seen within the middle cranial fossa (for further details, see the head CT from today).
CT Head [**4-22**]: FINDINGS: High-density material consistent with metallic fragments are seen adjacent to the right TMJ where there are bone fragments (series 3, image 6).
CTA Head [**4-23**]: CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD: The CT angiography of the head demonstrates evidence of clipping of the right middle cerebral artery and right supraclinoid internal carotid artery.
CT angiography shows occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery secondary to clipping.
Head CT [**4-24**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Compared to one day prior, there is increased edema within the right frontal lobe with increased herniation of the brain parenchyma through the right frontal calvarial defect.
Head CT [**4-27**]: FINDINGS: Overall, there is minimal change when compared to the previous examinations.
Head CT [**4-29**]: FINDINGS: Again seen is massive right frontal and temporal and less severe left frontal swelling with edema and mass effect.
There is a small left frontal subdural hematoma that appears slightly larger than on the study of [**2117-4-28**].
Head CT [**5-1**]: IMPRESSION: Right frontotemporal edema, evolving right MCA infarct, small left subdural hematoma, and left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage are similar to [**2117-4-29**].
Chest X-Ray [**5-1**]: FINDINGS: Since the prior study of one day earlier, multifocal patchy opacities in the perihilar and basilar regions have minimally progressed, and could be due to atelectasis or infection.
CT Torso [**5-4**]: CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The tracheostomy tube is in place.
Although this study was not optimized for evaluating the vasculature, several filling defects including a segmental branch of the right lower lobar pulmonary artery, compatible with pulmonary embolism.
There is a peripheral noncalcified tiny pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe measuring 3 mm on series 2, image 22.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver is homogeneous in attenuation, without focal lesions or biliary ductal dilatation.
Abdominal loops of large and small bowel are normal.
CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is large amount of stool in the rectum and the sigmoid colon.
This study was not optimized for evaluation of pulmonary vasculature, and dedicated CTA chest is recommended to confirm the finding and evaluate extent of pulmonary embolism.
Head CT [**5-11**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Limited exam given streak artifact from multiple metallic fragments.
Compared to the prior exam from [**2117-5-4**], there is decreased herniation of the brain parenchyma through the right parietal osseous defect.
Compared to prior exam from [**2117-5-4**], there is minimally decreased edema of the brain parenchyma.
On [**4-28**] the neurological exam changed.
Stat CT showed increased edema and he was aggressively started on 3% saline and mannitol.
There was a family meeting on [**4-30**] to explain that the patient's exam was worse.
On [**5-2**] his lumbar drain was removed due to concerns of infection, as he continued to be febrile.
On [**5-3**], his examination was noticeably improved.
[**5-4**], his examination continued to wax and wane (at times would follow commands, and other times not).
CT Head, Torso, Labs, and LENIS were sent to interrogate for alternate pathologic cause.
CT head, and torso were negative for infectious process.
[**5-6**], his examination appeared to be more improved with spontaneous movement of the right upper extremity.
His sutures were then d/c'd on [**5-18**] and he was trnasferred to the floor on [**5-19**].
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush PICC, non-heparin dependent: Flush with 10 mL Normal Saline daily and PRN per lumen.
?Have your incision checked daily for signs of infection.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast at that appt.
