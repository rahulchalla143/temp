BNP was 750 at OSH.
She was extubated on [**2153-1-14**], with ABG 7.46/48/60/91 on CPAP prior to extubation (no repeat ABG's have been done).
In addition, patient was ruled out for MI per history, with peak troponin of 0.10 at OSH (ranging 0.06-->0.10-->0.06 w/ flat CKs).

Radiology  A. CXR HISTORY: Systolic CHF recently extubate, to assess for edema or infiltrate.
CT chest ([**1-12**]) -- OSH read No e/o PE or aortic dissection.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with inferior/inferolateral akinesis, inferoseptal akinesis/hypokinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

Patient maintaining saturations of 91-93 % on supplemental oxygen.
# Tracheobronchomalacia: Patient is to follow-up on outpatient basis with interventional pulmonology for further work-up and consideration of stent.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF (EF 25-35%): Patient's ECHO is suggestive of prior myocardial infarction.
Her RCRI perioperative risk of MI or cardiac death is approximately 5.4 %, and medical optimization was recommended including lisinopril, statin, ASA, and beta blockade.
Outpatient Lab Work Please have electrolytes, including Na, K, Cl, CO2, BUN, Creatinine and magnesium checked on [**2153-1-16**] and faxed to: BROWN,[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Fax: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37167**] 18. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) vial for nebulizer Inhalation three times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
We performed studies that determined your shortness breath is due to your underlying lung condition called COPD.
The goal blood pressure is 85-120 systolic.
You should have your electroyltes checked on thursday when you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**].
You will need a cardiac catheterization in 1 month.
You were evaluated for a defibrillator and you were recommended to have a repeat echocardiogram in 3 months to evaluate the need for a defibrillator.
