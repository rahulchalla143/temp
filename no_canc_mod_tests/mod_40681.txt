EKG showed paced rhythm and hematocrit was noted to be 31.4 from 39.2 one week prior.
CTA was done for concern of dissection and showed a left RP bleed with active extravasation at the left iliacus muscle.
[**Month/Year (2) 263**] was 4.2 and creatinine was newly elevated to 1.7.
IR recommended reversal of coagulopathy for [**Month/Year (2) 263**] < 2, and consider embolization if HCT continues to fall.
Repeat vitals: HR 80, BP 111/70 18 100% RA.

mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 93613**] for sub therapeutic [**Date range (3) 263**] now on Lovenox bridge and Coumadin who presents with 2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma .
He was found to have a large retroperitoneal hematoma with evidence of active arterial extravasation on imaging in the setting of a supra therapeutic [**Date range (3) 263**] and Lovenox bridge.
The general surgery, vascular surgery, and interventional radiology services were consulted for possible operative/procedural management.
He underwent mesenteric angiogram although an active source of bleeding was not able to be identified.
IR consulted, recommended Ultrasound-guided left common femoral artery access, abdominal aortogram, it reveled extensive atherosclerotic disease as seen on prior CT, no active contrast extravasation identified.
Labs showed CK of 740, bladder presser of 29.
Noted to have decreased movement in his right, CT scan head showed chronic infarct within the right PCA territory (present on CT from [**2139**]).
Hypo density noted within the margin between the left PCA and MCA, suggestive of possible subacute watershed infarct, neurology recommended to maintain anticoagulation with goal PTT 50-70 to avoid new embolic events, though current infarct was likely watershed in the context of hypotension to the 70s systolic.
Serial hematocrit checks.
[**2142-5-30**] Patient transfused 2 RBC for HCT of 23.

[**2142-6-11**] Ct scan torso: Newly distended gallbladder with wall edema, internal sludge, and a gallstone, concerning for cholecystitis.
We will await culture data from this source.
He has pleural effusions, his nurse reports increased secretions and now has GNR and GPC's from his sputum which may indicate a pulmonary source of infection and a hospital acquired source of infection is of additional concern.
This should provide broad gram positive, fungal and anaerobic coverage as well as some gram negative coverage.
