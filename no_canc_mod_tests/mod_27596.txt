Echo [**2124-2-22**]: There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the anterior wall, apex, lateral wall and basal to mid inferior walls.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (EF 20-25%) The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
RUQ u/s [**2124-2-27**]: 1.
Limited study due to patient immobility and intubated status.
Trans-esophageal echo [**2124-3-3**]: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Cardiac cath revealed severe 3VD with decreased EF, elevated pulmonary pressures, and thrombocytopenia.
He was not a CT surgical candidate, so he underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with atherectomy and placement of BMS to the LAD.
He was evaluated but deemed not a CT surgical candidate, so was taken for cath to undergo high risk intervention.
Initail echo showed EF 25%, but repeat TEE showed improvemed EF of 35-40%, with evidence of ant/lat wall hypokinesis, and MR.  His IABP and pressers were weaned slowly and the patient extubated.
His blood pressure remained stable and he was started on low dose b-blocker and ACEi.
His exam was benign and RUQ was negative.
DIC labs were checked and were normal.
HIT and DIC labs were negative.
His Hepatitis B serologies are as follows: Surface antigen negative, Surface antibody positive, Core antibody negative.
Iron studies revealed mixed AOCD with iron deficiency (iron 32, TIBC 191, ferritin 215, transferrin 147).
Folate was >20, and vitamin B12 was 795.
# DM - His Diabetes is longstanding with nephropathy and blindness.
NPH was not re-started during the hospitalization as pt's intake was moderate and sugars were controlled with the sliding scale.
Captopril 12.5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): hold for systolic BP < 100.  .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1.
Acute on chronic renal failure, with initiation of hemodialysis   Discharge Condition: Stable, maintaining oxygen saturation on room air, maintaining blood pressure   Discharge Instructions: You were found to have blockages in the arteries that feed your heart, and had a stent placed in one of these arteries.
