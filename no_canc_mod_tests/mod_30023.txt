The patient's postoperative course was complicated on postoperative day number one with an episode of marked hypotension reportedly with systolic pressures down into the 50s.
Ultimately, this was felt to be secondary to benzodiazepines and narcotics which he was receiving per the ICU team.
The patient's antiepileptic levels were monitored throughout his hospital course and they remained stable.
A swallow study was being obtained on the day of discharge to evaluate the patient's swallowing function.
