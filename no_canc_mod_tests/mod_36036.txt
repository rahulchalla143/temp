Her VS in the ED were T 102, BP 150/62, HR 140, RR 26, SaO2 80%/RA.
She had transient hypotension with SBP's to the 90's, thought to be secondary to per-intubation and received 3 L NS with good response of her SBP to the 110's.

Admission CXR INDICATION: 66-year-old woman with hypoxia, shortness of breath and fever status post endotracheal intubation and left internal jugular line placement.
Portable AP chest dated [**2190-9-11**] at 9:37 a.m. is compared to the same examination from two hours earlier.
CT Neck: FINDINGS: The patient has had a radical neck dissection on the right.
Smaller higher density lymph nodes are seen along the left jugulodigastric chain, not significantly changed since a prior CT of the cervical spine, [**2190-9-9**].
This lesion was probably present on the prior CT of the cervical spine, although it is difficult to visualize due to the lack of IV contrast on that study.
PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: No significant interval change is seen.
If there is clinical concern for a patellar fracture, then further assessment with an axial image of the patellofemoral joint could help for more detailed assessment.

Hypoxic respiratory distress - most likely [**2-4**] aspiration event, given her history and CXR findings of no focal infiltrates.
Baseline requirement of 2 L NC due to underlying restrictive lung disease, and she did well post extubation and was at  baseline O2 requirements.
Given mild CHF noted on CXR (nl Echo [**5-8**]), she was diursed gently.
# L hip pain s/p fall - Pelvic CT was obtained per ortho and showed acute nondisplaced fractures of the left sacrum, anterior column of the left acetabulum, and left inferior pubic ramus, along with chronic fracture deformities of the right proximal femur, left proximal femur, left superior pubic ramus, and left inferior pubic ramus.
Whether this Parkinsons disease is the culprit for her orophyarngeal dysphagia is unclear, the neurology team thought that it could be.
Vit D levels were ordered and pending at the time of discharge.
