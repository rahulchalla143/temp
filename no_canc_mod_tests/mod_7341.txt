Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac cath s/p 2 bare metal stents to SVG-OM  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 27671**] is a 60 year-old patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11493**] with a long history of CAD s/p 2-vessel CABG in [**2100**] (SVG to LAD and SVG to OM), s/p PTCA to RCA and multiple PTCAs and brachytherapy of the SVG to OM (last in [**2121-1-29**]), who was admitted to [**Location (un) **] with cough and wheezing, as well as anginal symptoms on [**2123-3-8**].
She presented to the OSH on [**2123-3-8**], and was found to have a temperature of 101.4 in the ED, WBC 13.1, 18% bands, and CXR revealed a LLL infiltrate on CXR.
Given her history of chest pain, cardiac enzymes were also sent.
While in hospital, her cardiac enzymes rose with peak CK-MB 41.6, Troponin I 13.02, and EKG revealed ST depressions in anterolateral leads.
On [**2123-3-9**], she also developed what seems to be acute respiratory distress in the setting of elevated blood pressure with SBP 150-200, and desaturation to 60s on 2L via NC.
ABG 7.25/69/103.
Of note, by the patient account, she recently had an echo and had her Nitro patch increased to 0/8 mg/24 hours over 24 hours because of accelerating anginal symptoms.
Last cath in [**7-/2122**]: SVG to the LAD had mild diffuse disease up to 30%, patent SVG to OM with 40-50% stenosis in the mid distal graft section not hemodynamically significant to the obtuse marginal and the previously placed stent was widely patent.
Osteoarthritis 10.
Obesity  NOTE: She has had a 70 point difference in blood pressure in both arms in the past.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Physical examination on admission to CCU: VITALS: T 99.0, HR 81, BP right arm (164/67, left arm 117/67) previously documented, RR 16, Sat 100% on NRB GEN: Morbidly obese caucasian woman.
JVP difficult to assess secondary to body habitus.
Pertinent Results: Laboratory data from the OSH on admission: CBC: WBC 13.1 with 18% bands, 66% neutrophils.
Hct 40.6, Plt 137.
Chemistry: Na 144, K 4.6, Cl 102, HCO3 27, BUN 21.6, Creat 1.3 (was 1.1 in [**3-/2122**]), Glucose 1.3.
Cardiac enzymes: CK 404-->576 CKMB 29.9-->41.6 MB index 7.4-->7.2 Trop 0.06-->13.02-->7.42  Microbiology data: [**2123-3-8**] Blood cultures pending  CXR: LLL infiltrate  EKG [**2123-3-9**]: NSR, rate 110, normal intervals, normal axis.
EKG on arrival to CCU [**Hospital1 18**]: NSR, rate 77 bpm.
Selective graft angiography revealed a SVG->OM with a 60% lesion in the distal segment followed by a 70% lesion in the distal anastomosis into the native OM.
Hemodynamic evaluation revealed normal right and left heart filling pressures.
Final angiography revealed 10% residual stenosis in the distal SVG, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).
Overall left ventricular systolic function iis probably preserved but views are technically suboptimal for assessment of global and regional wall motion.
Right ventricular systolic function is probably normal.

Cath showed 30-40% SVG-LAD-D, and 80% OM distal to SVG.
2) Refractory HTN: Pt's outpt hydralazine was doubled with better control of her blood pressure, around 130-150 systolically.
ECHO was limited, but showed probably normal EF, with 3-4+ MR. Pt was aggresively diuresed to a dry weight of 133.8kg, which is the lowest she has weighed per pt.
She received Atrovent and Albuterol nebs for bronchodilator therapy during her hospitalization, and was d/c'd on MDI's.
Her HBA1C = 6.1%, consistent with borderline diabetes.
7) Anemia, maybe d/t hypothyroidism: Pt was guiaic negative with normal iron, vitamin B12, and folate.
She was transfused a total of 2 units of PRBC during her hospitalization with her hematocrit on discharge = 34.
Calcium 600mg by mouth twice a day 7.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Decompensated CHF 3.
Hypothyroidism  Discharge Condition: Pt had stable vital signs, a blood pressure around 140 systolically, with a Hct of 34, able to ambulate with walker, saturating > 91% on room air, weighing 133.8 kgs, which is her dry weight.
