A CXR revealed bilateral inifiltrates.
A CT of the abdomen was obtained due to clinical concern of possible hemorrhagic pancreatitis, however the CT remained stable without e/o hemorrhage.
Reticulocyte count was 3.2.
She had anemia with a normal MCV and RDW > 22 indicating two distinct populations of red cells, presumably related to etoh abuse, folate deficiency and iron deficiency.
# Transaminitis with fatty infiltration on CT Likely Alcoholic Steatohepatis Transaminitis on admission: AST/ALT > 2 (50/22) with normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
Her enzymes fell over the hospitalization until they abruptly rose.
Will need CBC and trigylcerides checked at that time.
