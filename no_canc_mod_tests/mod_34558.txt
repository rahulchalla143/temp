Pt's Hct remained stable for the hospital course.
Pt's nadolol was to ideally be up titrated to a goal HR < 60, but pt's blood pressure remained stable near 90s/60s and may be uptitrated as outpt.
CXR was negative for pneumonia.
Thus a joint aspiration was done, which showed a WBC 200, which r/o septic arthtis.
No crystals were seen so gout vs. pseudogout could not be confirmed or excluded from the aspiration - since pt's joint flare was resolving at that point.
Medication changes: - take 1 more day of Cipro 500mg once tomorrow - Nadalol 20mg was added to reduce risk of bleeding from the varices - take lacutlose if needed to have 1 bowel movement per day to help with your liver disease - sucrulfate was added to help stop further gi bleeding - prednisone 20mg for 2 more days - one tablet per day for joint pain - oxycodone if needed for this pain temporarily  If you vomit blood again, or develop a fever > 100.4 return to the ED immediately.
