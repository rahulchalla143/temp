b.i.d., again in an effort to keep his heart rate and blood pressure under control.

On [**1-16**], the chief resident noted that he had an adequate beta blockade on 150 mg of Lopressor b.i.d., so he was put back on Nipride to bring down his blood pressure acutely to a goal of 130 systolic.
His chest x-ray showed pleural effusion and atelectasis.
He was confused and agitated during the morning and pulling his lines, so his intubation was done for better control and management of the airway and better pulmonary toilet.
A bronchoscopy was done which showed secretions, especially in his left lower lobe.
Plans were made to discontinue his sedation and his paralysis so he could be extubated.
His creatinine was improving and was now back down to 2.2, with a potassium of 3.6, and a stable hematocrit at 26.7.
He had a good blood pressure of 119/65 with a heart rate in the 80s.
He remained on an amiodarone drip and continued on double antibiotic therapy with a stable hematocrit, and creatinine that now dropped from 2.2 to 1.9.
The rest of his examination benign.
His creatinine was 1.7, with a stable hematocrit of 27.6.
His examination was otherwise unremarkable.
On postoperative day eight, he had a good blood pressure and remained in sinus rhythm.
His examination was benign.
His blood pressure remained in the 130 to 140 systolic range with diastolics in the 80 to 100 range.
He was satting 98% on 2 liters but remained in sinus rhythm.
He had a Psychiatry consultation on [**1-21**] for his periodic agitation and confusion.
Their impression was that he had delirium and a possible pancreatitis with elevated lipase and amylase.
His examination was benign.
