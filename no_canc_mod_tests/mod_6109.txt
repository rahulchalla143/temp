On arrival in the ED, the patient had a pulse of 75, blood pressure 91/61, respiratory rate 25, satting at 100% on a nonrebreather face [**Month/Year (2) **].
The patient became acutely hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 70s and was placed on a dopamine drip.
Chest x-ray at that time was consistent with pulmonary edema.
The patient got 100 of IV lasix with 230 cc of urine output.
ECG showed a paced rhythm at 75 with a question of ST elevations in II, III and F, as well as a question of newly positive axis in V1 and V2 that had previously been negative.
VITALS ON ARRIVAL IN THE UNIT:  The patient had a temperature of 99.8, blood pressure of 108/57 on 5 mcg of dopamine, pulse was 95.
Cardiovascular exam - the patient had a paced rhythm, normal S1, split S2, no murmur, gallops or rubs, and a diffuse, anteriorly displaced PMI.
Extremities - the patient had trace ankle edema bilaterally and dopplerable DP and PT pulses bilaterally.
Chest x-ray on admission showed no obvious pacer migration with mild cephalization of vessels, a small right pleural effusion and was read as being consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
ECG showed a paced rhythm at 75 with a wide QRS, positive axis in V1 and V2 that was previously negative, and a question of ST elevations in leads II, III and F.  The patient's white count on admission was 17.1 with a differential of 55 neutrophils, 0 bands, 40 lymphocytes.
Hematocrit was 32.8, platelets 382.
The patient's sodium on admission was 125, K 3.8, BUN and creatine 34 and 1.5, respectively.
The patient had three sets of cardiac enzymes in the Emergency Department.
Her highest CK was 20 and her troponins remained less than 0.3.
She also had urine cultures and blood cultures drawn.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM - 1) CARDIOVASCULAR - CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient on admission was on aspirin, Lipitor, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor.
She had a repeat echo shortly after admission which showed no significant changes from the previous echo which was done on the [**8-8**].
The patient remained hemodynamically stable with blood pressures largely in the high-80s to low-100s throughout the course of her stay.
A chest x-ray at that time showed congestive heart failure.
RHYTHM:  The patient's ECG showed an extremely wide QRS and a change from left bundle to right bundle morphology in V1 and V2 which was felt to be more consistent with the patient's native complex.
All cultures remained negative throughout admission.
Nevertheless, on her chest x-ray there was also a question of left lower lobe pneumonia versus atelectasis with a left-sided pleural effusion.
3) PULMONARY:  After the one hypoxic episode the night after admission, the patient remained comfortable on room air with oxygen saturations greater than 95%.
Urine electrolytes were sent suggesting the patient was prerenal.
Urine culture was sent which remained negative throughout the course of the patient's stay.
The patient had excellent urine output greater than 30 cc/hr throughout the course of her stay and responded well to diuresis.
Thyroid function tests were sent which showed her TSH to be elevated, her T4 and free-T4 to be normal, and her T3 to be low.
