Laboratories from the outside hospital included a CPK of 213, MB fraction of 12.7 and a troponin of 0.42, transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization this morning revealed a right dominant system with subtotal occlusion of TIMI two flow after D2, 70% osteal D2 and a 3.5 by 28 stent was placed in the left anterior descending artery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ARRIVAL TO THE CORONARY CARE UNIT: Temperature 97.3.
Blood pressure 112/78.
Heart rate 61.
Respiratory rate 16 .
Telemetry revealed twelve beat runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and asymptomatic.
His neck examination revealed no jugulovenous distention, supple with flat neck veins.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
Cardiovascular examination S1 and S2 with a regular rate.
Abdominal examination bowel sounds present, soft, nontender, nondistended.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 13.5, hematocrit 45.2, platelets 328, sodium 139, potassium 4.5, chloride 101, CO2 29, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 117, calcium 9.7, magnesium 2.1, phos 4.2, AST 457, ALT 75, alkaline phosphatase 130.
TPK of 3901, MB of 665 and troponin greater then 50.
Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital revealed a rate of 70 normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, right atrial enlargement, ST elevations in V2 to V4 with poor R wave progression, Q waves in 2, 3, AVF and V1 through V3.
Cardiovascular:  Cardiac catheterization was performed on arrival to [**Hospital1 346**], which again revealed subtotal occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery with TIMI two flow just after the D2 branch.
An echocardiogram performed after cardiac catheterization revealed moderately dilated left ventricular with severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderately depressed overall left ventricular systolic function and anterior apical and septal akinesis, as well as mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Based on his echocardiogram Coumadin was started for anticoagulation to prevent thrombus formation.
A signal ECG was performed with the results pending at the time of dictation.
