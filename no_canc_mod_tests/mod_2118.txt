# Hyponatremia: The patient's history and physical exam was consistent with volume depletion, with Na of 107.
Following hydration, the Na did not entirely correct, indicating a possible component of SIADH secondary to COPD and recent PNA.
# Adrenal Insufficiency:  Per Endocrinology, recent Cosyntropin stimulation testing revealed a mildly suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with a low baseline cortisol level and an insufficient response to ACTH stimulation.
His oxygen saturation with ambulation dropped to 80%, though he was not dyspneic.
His serum bicarbonate level rose to 39, though his venous pH was 7.35. .
Chronically on coumadin with INR 1.5 on admission.
EKG shows he is ventricularly paced, no ischemic changes.
Coumadin was continued through his stay and his INR was therapeutic at the time of discharge.
As his HRs remained stable during the rest of the admission, diltiazem was stopped at the time of discharge, to avoid excessive nodal blockade and interaction with other medications.
# CAD # CHF, chronic, systolic: No sign of volume overload on exam or CXR.
His weight at the time of discharge was 127.5 lbs.
Electrolyte levels were normal.
# Anemia: Hct was stable during this admission, though has been lower recently than previously.
