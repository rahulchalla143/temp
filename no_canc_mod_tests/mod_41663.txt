CT Chest ([**2-15**]): Severe emphysema is diffuse, associated with bronchial wall thickening and irregularity, suggesting small airway disease.
2-mm lung nodules are as follows: Subfissural right upper lobe (4:76), lingula (4:142) and left lower lobe (4:188).
This study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note severe aortic and vascular calcifications.
CT head ([**2-16**]): Evaluation is slightly limited by patient motion, despite repeat attempt to scan.

On admission a Chest X-ray showed possible lingular infiltrate that could be consistent with pneumonia therefore levofloxacin was started as well as high dose oral steroids for COPD exacerbation.
He also was believed to have a componenet of diastolic heart failure that was contributing to hic clinical condition and rate control was achieved with diltiazem.
A repeat Chest X-ray showed possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
A follow-up Chest CT confirmed a bilateral, multifocal pneumonia and antibiotics were continued to complete a 7 day course of vanc/Zosyn (last day on [**2-21**]).
Head CT was negative for acute bleed, urinalysis was negative, ABG was normal with no electrolyte abnormalities therefore this was thought secondary to benzos which were withheld.
Regarding other chronic medical issues, for his atrial fibrillation he was rate-controlled with diltiazem with heart rates in 60-80's, anti-coagulated with coumadin.
His INR at time of discharge was 4.5 therefore coumadin was held.
Blood pressures were in good control with systolics in 110-130's.
