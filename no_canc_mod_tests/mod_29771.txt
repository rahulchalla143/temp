Cardiac cath was not recommended.
Labs showed bicarb of 12 with anion gap of 26, normal CBC, lipase of 93, EtOH of 69, normal LFTs, and trop < 0.01.
His last admission was for chest pain; he was considered for catheterization but decision was made at that time to hold off due to his medication noncompliance and continued alcohol abuse.
He [**Date Range 20003**] out for MI with enzymes negative x3 and EKG has been unchanged.
EKG was performed which showed evidence of old infarct but no acute changes.

DIAGNOSTICS: --ECG   [**2116-11-9**] Since the previous tracing the rate is slower.
He was weaned off the CIWA scale after several days without issue and hallucinosis resolved, he appeared less tremulous, and overall was feeling much better.
Had intermittent symptoms of [**2115-1-27**] chest pain, often sharp and midline, throughout his hospitalization and was seen to have EKG's unchanged from prior, and pt had [**Date Range 20003**] out for MI with cardiac enzymes.
Should he continue to have chest pain at the rehab, would give sublingual nitroglycerins, check blood pressure and if elevated consider giving an extra Metoprolol; also consider relaxation techniques given self reported anxiety.
His CXR appeared unchanged and consistent with COPD.
His blood pressure should be followed up and consider titrating his medications; his Valsartan could potentially be uptitrated.
He also needs to quit drinking alcohol which will likely benefit his blood pressure.
