Neuro:  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage-area of surrounding edema on CT concerning for underlying mass, infarct or AVM.
He underwent a MRI with gado and MRA which showed prominance of the veins near the area of hemorrhage-there was no enhancing mass visualized.
Repeat head CT showed no change in hemorrhage.
CTA was done to look for AVM and showed an area of abnormality anterior to the right parietal hemorrage (unrelated to it) which was thought to represent an AVM or venous malformation.
Cerebral angiogram was done to clarify this question and showed no evidence for AVM, but suggested an underlying venous anomaly in the internal cerebral veins.
