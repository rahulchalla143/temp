HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted [**2105-7-22**] for an elective angiography of his left internal mammary artery and right internal mammary artery with possible coronary artery bypass grafting.
Cardiac catheterization was performed [**2105-7-23**], which revealed moderate stenoses of the proximal innominate, right subclavian and left subclavian artery with no resting gradient, a patent left internal mammary artery and a peak gradient of 20 mmHg across the left subclavian stenosis with hyperemia.
Also of note the innominate and left subclavian angiography revealed that there was a 50% proximal stenoses of the innominate artery and a 50% osteal right subclavian stenosis.
