LIVER BIOPSY [**2117-9-2**]: 1)  Cirrhosis with prominent sinusoidal distribution of fibrosis (confirmed by trichrome stain) Stage 4 fibrosis.
4)  Iron stain shows minimal iron deposition within Kupffer cells.
Brief Hospital Course: 30 yo M with severe EtOH hepatitis complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] and also with RLE cellulitis transferred from OSH for further evaluation of hepatitis.
Biopsy was initially deferred as the alcohol history was so prominent.
A biopsy was eventually performed when liver function did not improve, and it was confirmed to be alcoholic hepatitis with underlying cirrhosis.
Bilirubin was ~40 on admission and continued to increase before stabilizing around 47.
# Cirrhosis - Abdominal ultrasound was performed which showed no mass lesions in the liver, but confirmed cirrhosis and a small amount of ascites.
A second ultrasound was performed but a suitable area for paracentesis was not identified.
Creatinine improved to about 1.5 on discharge.
High WBC count was assumed to be related to steroids and severe hepatitis.
SBP was treated with ceftriaxone and cellulitis was treated with vancomycin.
WBC did not improve and was still high on discharge.
Urine culture, blood culture and CXR all normal.
Blood cultures remained negative.
You had a liver biopsy which confirmed that this was the cause of your liver injury.
