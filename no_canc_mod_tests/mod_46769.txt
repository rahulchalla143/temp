Otherwise SILT L1-S1 dermatomal distributions BLE: [**6-1**] IP/Qu/HS/TA/GS/[**Last Name (un) **]/FHL/Per BLE: tone normal, no clonus, toes downgoing, 2+ DTR knee/ankle All toes WWP, brisk capillary refill, 2+ distal pulses  At discharge: VS: T 99.2, BP 102/50, HR 57, RR 18, O2 95% on 1 liter O2 GENERAL: NAD, breathing comfortably CV: RRR CHEST: Good breath sounds throughout, mild crackles at the bases, no rhonchi or wheezing ABDOMEN: soft, nontender, nondistended NEURO: Alert, oriented x3, attentive PSYCH: Calm, appropriate  Pertinent Results: ECHO [**4-30**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CT CHEST [**5-3**]: AIRWAYS AND LUNGS: The tip of endotracheal tube extends to the carina, almost encroaching into the right main bronchus.
ABDOMEN: This study is not designed for assessment of subdiaphragmatic pathologies; however, limited views revealed surface irregularity and heterogeneity of the liver, multiple perigastric and perisplenic collateral vessels and mild ascites distributed in the perihepatic region which consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension (known cirrhosis per clinical history).
Bilateral, diffuse, ground-glass and reticular opacities, and dependent foci of consolidation.
On concurrently review with prior chest radiograph series through [**4-28**] to [**2154-5-3**], this most likely represents ARDS.
RUQ U/S [**2154-5-5**]: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 8**] Spine Surgery Service and taken to the Operating Room for the above procedure.
Pain was not immediately well controlled.
A chest XRAY at that point was concerning for pneumonia with pulmonary edema, and she was noted to have a Hafina alvei UTI.
The medicine consult service recommended further diuresis (received a totoal of 90mg IV lasix over he course of the morning) without good urine output or symptomatic improvement.
Echo showed some mild pulmonary hypertension but no other major abnormalities.
Chest CT also appeared consistent with ARDS picture.
# Renal Failure: Pt with Cr peaking at 3.1.
Urine output improved with diuresis and Cr trended down to 2.6 on discharge  # Hypernatremia: To 150.
# EtOH/HCV Cirrhosis:  PCP reportedly following cirrhosis which is [**2-28**] ETOH.
Pt with some asterixis on exam in MICU.
