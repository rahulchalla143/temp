FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views obtained with patient in upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with a preceding chest examination of [**2188-4-17**].
Pulmonary vasculature unaltered, thus no evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema.
On the preceding study, the lateral pleural sinuses were free (single view chest x-ray examination).
In comparison with the preoperative chest examination of [**4-10**] (PA and lateral view), the pleural sinuses are free.
His platelet count dropped as low as 66K but by discharge, his platelet count normalized.
A postop HIT assay was negative.
He was intermittently transfused with PRBC to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
