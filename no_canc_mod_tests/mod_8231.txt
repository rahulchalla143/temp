CXR [**1-29**]: Bilateral small pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged.
Cath [**2-2**]: 1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed moderate LMCA and multivessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided filling pressures with RVEDP 9 mmHg and LVEDP 21 mmHg.
The cardiac output is minimally depressed with CI 2.46 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption).
There was severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 36 mmHg and a calculated valve area of 0.7 cm2.
CT chest: 1.
In the absence of risk factors, a 12-month followup chest CT is warranted.
These could be further evaluated with CT or MRI.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %).
Electronically signed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4901**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2196-2-8**] 20:39  Brief Hospital Course: 77 y/o female with a h/o moderate Aortic stenosis with most recent echo in [**2188**], HTN who presented with progressive dyspnea among other symptoms, 3VD on cath and worsening Aortic stenosis.
# Aortic stenosis - last echo in [**2188**] with valve area 1cm now with severe Aortic stenosis, area 0.8cm2, [**12-27**]+ AR.
CHF: exam, CXR and symptoms consistent with progressive CHF, last echo in [**2188**] showed EF 55% and echo on this admission shows markedly decreased LVEF (25%) likely in setting of CAD (3-vd on cath).
Catheterization was performed and showed moderate LMCA and multivessel coronary artery disease in a left dominant system (see cath report for details).
# Emphysematous changes on CXR - pt is non-smoker, no occupational exposure, no history of asthma.
CT chest shows mild changes, which are unlikely to be clinically significant.
