[**2163-9-12**] [**Month/Day/Year 47963**]: The lower lumbar spine as well as the pelvic bones are obscured by retained contrast in the bowel from a prior contrast examination; within these limitations, there is mild lumbar scoliosis convex to the left.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
However, there is no substantial change from prior echo on [**2163-8-18**].
[**2163-9-15**] Bilateral LE US: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2163-9-17**] Unilateral UE US: FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler evaluation of left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, response to augmentation in the deep veins.
[**2163-9-18**] CT Abd/Pelvis: Lung bases are clear.
The lack of intravenous administration limits the evaluation of solid organs.
Renal sizes are stable in length when compared with the previous study of [**2161**].
Within the left inguinal canal, again seen is a relatively low attenuation structure, which was also present on the study of [**2161**] and was further evaluated with scrotal ultrasound on [**2163-4-12**].
Finding in the left inguinal canal, which was better evaluated on scrotal ultrasound of [**2163-4-12**].
Surveillance blood cultures were negative [**Date range (1) 47964**], and a repeat TEE did not show any change.
An MRI of the Lumbar spine without contrast was obtained and did not show any evidence of fluid collection or abscess.
It was discussed whether an MRI with contrast would be a better study, however after extensive discussion with the radiologist it was felt that this was not necessary.
A CT of abdomen and pelvis was negative for abscess.
He was also noted to have a slowly decreasing WBC count which was attributed to Nafcillin.
WBC count did improve with this change.
He will be followed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7443**] of ID and has a prescription for surveillance CBC and LFTs while on antibiotics.
He was transferred briefly to the ICU, and his BP stabilized with fluids and antibiotics.
His ACE inhibitor and Beta-Blocker were initially discontinued, but then the ACE was resumed once his BP remained stable.
An MRI without contrast showed disc derangements at L4/L5 and disc extrusion at S1 likely causing nerve root compression.
The pt did not have any signs to suggest cord compression, and his neuro exam remained normal.
Heparin products were stopped and a HIT antibody was sent, which was negative.
2. pump- echo in [**7-26**] with global hypokinesis, EF 45% and cath in [**2161**] with evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
His fluid balance was monitored carefully and corrected with dialysis.
His ACE and beta-blocker were initially held in the setting of sepsis, but both were resumed once his blood pressure stabilized.
Valves- mod AR, pt recently underwent cardiac MR last week to further evaluate at the recommendations of his cardiologists.
Although his repeat TEE was unchanged, it was thought that endocarditis was the most likely cause of his bacteremia and he will be treated with a 6 week course of antibiotics.
A repeat US showed persistent nonocclusive clot in the right IJ.
Outpatient Lab Work CBC with differential to be done on Monday [**9-26**] and Friday [**9-30**] then weekly until antibiotic course is completed, LFTs done weekly beginning Monday [**9-26**], and Gentamicin peak done on Wednesday [**9-28**].
- Aortic regurgitation 2+ - Bleeding diathesis NOS - Systolic heart failure - resolved - Bilateral subclavian vein thromboses on US in [**9-24**] - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Pyloric stenosis in childhood, surgically repaired   Discharge Condition: [**Name (NI) 14658**] pt afebrile, tolerating a regular diet.
An MRI of your back showed disc disease.
You will need to have certain lab tests to monitor your blood counts and liver function while you are on the antibiotics.
You should follow up with your primary care doctor for a blood pressure check to see if this is stable.
You were also noted to have a decreased white blood cell count which is being attributed to the antibiotics you were taking.
The white blood cell count improved on a new antibiotic.
The antibiotics were changed, however you should have a complete blood count on Monday to ensure it continues to be normal.
You will also need surveillence blood tests while you are on antibiotics to check your blood counts and liver function tests.
Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] .
You should also have your blood drawn the day of your appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
