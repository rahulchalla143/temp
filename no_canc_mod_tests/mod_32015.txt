Patient was initially presented to an OSH on [**2-19**] for evaluation of sudden onset aphasia that day, which was noted to occur in the past after seizures.
Repeat ABG shows increased hypoxia on same oxygen settings and worsening A-a gradient (570=>583, normal 19).

Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
~ [**2173-2-20**]: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube has been removed.
ECHO: ~[**2173-2-20**]: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease or stress cardiomyopathy.
MICRO: AFB smear neg x 3, cultures pending Urine and blood cultures neg   Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Summary: 66 yo M with seizure disorder after EEE infection and former EtOH abuser who was transferred from an OSH in status epilepticus.
Unlikely alcohol withdrawal as patient reported he had not had EtOH use recently and his toxicology screen was negative for EtOH.
His head CT from the OSH shows stable L frontal encephalomalacia.
# Hypoxia: Patient became acute hypoxic on the floor after being called out from the ICU, presumably in the setting of continous IVFs and decreased LV ejection fraction of 30%.
Room air sats were 94% on RA at rest and xx% on ambulation.
CXR showed stable L lobar opacities.
AFB sputum negative x3.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were downtrending on discharge.
Patient will need a stress test as outpatient  # Pump: Patient had pulmonary edema with poor EF% (20-25%) which improved to 30% on repeat TTE, likely due to recent myocardial insult.
He will need a repeat TTE in [**6-2**] weeks as outpatient.
