He has done reasonably well since surgery [**53**] years ago, although recently underwent studies for iron deficiency anemia which revealed evidence of small bowel disease ([**5-14**] enteroscopy with small bowel ulceration/stricture 5cm proximal to stoma, [**7-13**] capsule study with distal small bowel inflammation).
Small bowel follow-through study in [**3-15**] revealed likely stricture just proximal to stoma.
A CT scan abdomen revealed dilated small bowel loops and portal venous air.
Resp: CTA, bilaterally ABD: soft, appropriately tender, normoactive bowel sounds, staples intact, open areas of wound packed with gauze, dressings clean/dry/intact, ostomy - red, watery green stool EXT: warm, well-perfused.
No edema NEURO: no focal deficits   Pertinent Results: [**2121-9-7**]: CXR 1.
Blood cultures and IV antibiotics (flagyl, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin) were initiated and the patient was brought to the surgical ICU for observation and further management.
He was placed on IV lopressor and an ECG was obtained, which revealed sinus tachycardia.
Clamping trials with the nasogastric tube were initiated on POD#2, yet residuals were elevated (>100cc) when checked every 4hours.
The open wound sites were packed wet-dry with gauze and covered with an abdominal pad.
The patient had a low-grade temperature (T=100.3) on POD#1, and was encouraged to use the incentive spirometer.
-Try to maintain ostomy output between 500mL to 1000mL per day.
-If Ostomy output >1 liter, take 4mg of Immodium, repeat 2mg with each episode of loose stool.
