IMAGING CXR ([**2124-3-15**]): FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.
EKG [**2124-3-15**]: HR 120, atrial tachycardia, Nl axis, normal interval, nl R wave progression, no ST-changes.
Microbiology: [**2-/2041**] Blood culture (FINAL): NO growth MRSA screen: NO MRSA isolated .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to extensive apical akinesis and severe hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle with the exception of the basal posterior and lateral walls, which are relatively preserved.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
A left ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded with certainty.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-10-7**], there has been marked further deterioration of left ventricular contractile function as well as marked increased in mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
[**3-19**] R FEMORAL ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: Focused vascular ultrasound of the right groin, the common femoral artery and vein was performed with [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale, color Doppler, and spectral analysis.
Brief Hospital Course: 69F with HX SVT, ESRD, CAD, PAD, and sCHF p/w symptomatic atrial tachycardia to the 130s during outpatient dialysis; admitted for management of this chronic problem, previously refractory to pharmacologic therapy and a 1st ablation attempt on [**2124-3-2**]; during this admission she underwent a 2nd ablation attempt which was not wholly successful (some intermittent Atach episodes thereafter), and which was c/b a post-procedure R femoral AVF.
Admission EKG here documented atrial tachycardia to the 130s, no ischemic changes.
# CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, LVEF 20% TTE during this admission demonstrated LVEF 20%, MR 4+ TR 4+, all worse than prior.
# ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION Patient's BP fell to 75/palp when working w/PT on [**3-20**].
EKGs negative for evidence of restenosis or ischemic changes.
Hct remained stable ~30.
Monitor exam for changes in R femoral AVF (vascular surgery f/u arranged) 6.
Depressed ejection fraction 4.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
