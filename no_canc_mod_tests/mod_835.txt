An ERCP during this admission showed a small stone and sludge was extracted and a stent was placed.
The plan was for follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an elective outpatint cholecystectomy in [**2-4**] months and for repeat ERCP in [**5-8**] wks for stent removal, balloon sweep, and pancreatic duct evaluation.
CT abd showed gallstones, air in lumen of gallbladder likely related to ERCP/stent placement, and no evidence of obstruction.
CXR revealed no infiltrates.

Imaging/results: CT a/p with contrast [**1-26**]: 1.
Pancreatic cystic lesions, one of which represents IPMN based on prior ERCP stable from [**Month (only) **], but both slightly increased since [**2159**].
EGD [**1-25**]: A few small ulcers were found in the antrum and body of the stomach.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the stomach antrum.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the duodenal bulb.
TTE [**12-19**] The left atrium is elongated.
CT Abd [**12-19**] 1.
This area could not be appreciated on the most recent prior study due to lack of intravenous contrast.
Colonic mucosal biopsies: A.  Proximal descending: Colonic mucosa with focal acute inflammation and crypt regeneration, suggestive of adjacent injury.
Repeat balloon sweeps were negative and occlusion cholangiogram revealed no residual filling defects.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 8435**] is an 85 year old man with history of celiac disease, hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism, a fib, osteoporosis, and gallstone pancreatitis who presented with elevated WBC/fever/elevated lactate/diarrhea/ARF.
Based on the clinical presentation, recent Abx course, there was a high suspicion of C. diff colitis, although other etiologies such as other infectious etilogies, ischemic colitis given atrial fibrillation, cholangitis, refractory celiac disease were considered.
No evidence of colitis was present on abd CT scan, although this was a noncontrast study.
A number of other studies were sent including fecal culture, ova and parasites, C. diff, Yersenia, Shigella, Campylobacter, Microsporidia, Giardia, Cryptosporidium were sent and were negative.
C. diff toxins were negative x 4 and PO Vancomycin was discontinued on [**12-18**].
On [**12-21**], the pt underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy which revealed a friable, ulcerative colonic mucosa which was concerning for viral pathologies such as CMV.
A serum CMV viral load was sent and was negative.
Pathology of colon biopsies was consistent with colitis, inflammation.
CMV stains on path were negative as well.
Though all C diff and CMV studies have returned negative, a decision was made with GI and ID teams' input to continue both oral vanco and ganciclovir treatment, though Vancomycin PO was d/c'd on [**1-2**] as cdiff was negative X6.
His HCT was 21.1 on morning labs on [**2164-1-1**] and was transferred to the ICU.
His Hct remained stable and he had a brown stool the morning of transfer back to the floor.
A repeat Flex sig [**2164-1-19**] showed good healing of the colonic lesions so anticoagulation was restarted.
An EGD was performed and 2 gastric ulcers were found and biopsies of the small intestine were done in multiple places to r/o MALT.
Need f/u HCT checks and monitoring for s/s of significant bleeding.
[**Month (only) 116**] require intermittant transfusion if HCT drifts down as it has been slowly decreasing over last 2 weeks with blood draws and possibly slow loss from GI source.
# MRSA bacteremia - On [**12-18**]/2 blood culture bottles grew MRSA.
After further review of his case (hx endocarditis [**2162**], as well as possible renal infarcts on CT scan).
PICC removed on [**12-18**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission have been without growth.
PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**] and has final result of no growth.
TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
# UTI - Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time.
As U/A was unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**].
Repeat urine cultures 11/30 and [**1-3**] were negative for enterobacter, but positive for enterococcus.
Per ID a repeat UA was performed and was negative for nitrites and leuk esterase.
A RUE US revealed no flow in a portion of cephalic vein, likely representing a superficial vein clot.
His anion gap was resolved at the time of transfer to the floor.
* Supratherapeutic INR on admission - Secondary to both coumadin and poor PO intake.
The patient received additional IV Vitamin K as INR on the day of callout was 4.5.
His INR improved and was 1.5 on the [**12-21**].
Given his atrial fibrillation and subacute strokes and renal infarct, ASA was restarted on [**12-22**] and then stopped in the setting of GIB.
His goal INR should be [**3-7**] with ideal range 2-2.5 given his high bleeding risk.
His CT Abd revealed a new renal infarct, may be related to embolic phenomenon from Afib vs. endocarditis.
His ASA was restarted on [**12-22**] then held in the setting of GIB, which was felt to be due to ischemic colitis (other evidence for embolization).
As above, coumadin restarted [**2164-1-20**] and INR should be check frequently.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice weekly (Monday, Thursday) ().
Release 24 hr Sig: Three (3) Capsule, Sust.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: Four (4) MG Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
Coumadin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: last INR 2.4 on [**2155-2-4**].
2. titration of coumadin: INR is 2.4 today, but we'd like to keep it between 2-2.5 if possible.
Last WBC count was 21 without any bands.
[**Month (only) 116**] require intermittant transfusion if HCT drifts down as it has been slowly decreasing over last 2 weeks with blood draws and possibly slow loss from GI source.
