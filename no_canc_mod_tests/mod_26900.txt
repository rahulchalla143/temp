Her WBC count there was 6.3 with 88% neutrophils and 5.9% lymphs.
Per OSH report, lumbar puncture was performed on [**2166-10-21**] and she was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone empiracally for coverage against bacterial meningitis.
CSF analysis revealed clear appearance, with tube #1: RBC 23, WBC 158, poly 28, lymph 62, mono 10.
Tube #2: RBC 0, WBC 176, poly 26, lymph 67, mono 7.
Glucose 51, protein 85.
Gram stain was negative and CSF culture has also shown no growth.
Blood culture x 2 have been negative.
CT scan of her head on [**2166-10-21**] was normal.
There were recommendations for further LP with more cultures in the morning.
An MRI was performed of her head.
Past Medical History: PMH (per mother and OSH records): Migraine HA, often with associated nausea and vomiting ADHD Intermittent bronchitis Alcohol abuse in the past, but no longer per mother Toxoplasma infection as a child, followed for 10 years as part of a study but with no known consequences  Social History: Lived in an apartment with her boyfriend until they broke up 6 days ago, planning on living with parents on discharge.
Disconjugate gaze with down and out deviation of the right eye noted when opening the eyelids to check pupillary reaction to light, with recovery of conjugation when focusing eyes.

CSF culture (from Outside hospital) (+) HSV-1, (-) HSV-1 .
Head MRI [**10-24**]: 1.
Head MRV [**10-24**]: The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal within the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses.
EEG [**10-24**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing and suppression, without clear reactivity to pain, suggestive of a severe encephalopathy.
Head CT [**10-26**]: 1.
Head CT [**10-26**]: Limited evaluation secondary to streak artifact from scalp electrode, however compared to prior exam there is worsening global edema, particularly marked within the right temporal hemisphere.
EEG [**10-26**]: There were no clearly focal or epileptiform features although encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal findings.
Initial consideration was for meningitis, and a lumbar puncture was done which revealed clear CSF and a lymphocyte predominant CSF (with normal glucose and elevated protein), with a negative gram stain and bacterial cultures.
Head CT was negative at the outside hospital.
Diagnostically, consideration was made for a repeat lumbar puncure, but imaging was pursued first.
She had a head MRI on the night of admission, which was read as "Right much greater than left predominantly temporal lobe FLAIR hyperintensity, mild cortical enhancement, and restricted diffusion raising concern for HSV encephalitis."
Given that the original MRI was consistent with HSV encephalitis, this was the working diagnosis.
CSF cultures from the outside hospital were sent for HSV pcr and culture.
Due to the concern for seizure activity, dilantin was loaded, and a stat CT was ordered.
The CT showed worseing swelling.
An EEG was done as well, and after completion of the exam, it was noted that her left pupil was fixed and dilated.
A repeat head CT was done several hours later that showed uncal herniation.
