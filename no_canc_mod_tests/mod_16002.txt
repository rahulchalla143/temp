VITAL SIGNS:  GCS 15, blood pressure 144/palp, pulse 90, respirations 18, satting 99% on room air.
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
FAST exam negative.
Neurologic exam - strength 5/5 bilaterally upper and lower extremities.
LABORATORIES:  Significant for a hematocrit stable at 43, and normal coags, and an alcohol level of 68.
RADIOLOGY:  A chest x-ray showed a widened mediastinum with a blurring of the aortic knob.
Head CT showed no fracture, no bleed.
The chest CTA was negative for great vessel injury, or other mediastinal abnormalities.
The C-spine CT showed a type 3 C2 or dens fracture that was unstable.
First, they recommended obtaining a four-vessel angiography to rule out any paravertebral vessel injury.
This study was obtained on hospital day #1 and was normal with no signs of any vessel injury.
The MRI of the C-spine demonstrated increased signal intensity within the C1-2 facet joints possibly secondary to traumatic injury, some neural foraminal injury at C3-C4, but no signs of injury to the spinal cord.
The patient was given instructions to make a follow-up appointment with his urologist at [**Hospital3 1810**] for evaluation of the likely urethral strictures.
It was suggested to the patient that if he was not able to make a follow-up appointment with his urologist at [**Hospital3 18242**], that a urology follow-up would be provided at [**Hospital1 **].
