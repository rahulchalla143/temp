PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on presentation to the emergency room at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] was temperature 102.6, blood pressure 163/68, heart rate 88.
She was breathing 20 times a minute and her O2 saturation was about 100 percent.
Right lower quadrant was benign as were the upper quadrants.
Vascular exam revealed palpable, 1 plus femorals and palpable DPs.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 620**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] were white count 9.8, hematocrit 42, platelets 294.
Sodium 140, potassium 3.3, chloride 101, bicarb 28, BUN 12, creatinine 0.9, glucose 121.
Amylase 114, lipase 212.
Urinalysis sent off after placement of Foley catheter was extremely positive, essentially draining pus which was positive for nitrites and white cells.
However, there was no way to rule out diverticulitis and the decision was made to conduct a CT scan that evening.
Foley catheter was carefully monitored for fluid output.
During the course of the next 12 hours and the following morning, it was noted that her abdominal exam had worsened and she now had diffuse peritonitis and rebound in all four quadrants of the abdomen.
On [**6-24**] she suffered an episode of hypertension and tachycardia which were unexplained and presumed due to PE until workup could be conducted.
She was also checked for cardiac enzymes times three which were negative over the next few hours.
A CT scan was performed emergently on [**6-24**] revealing no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
However, sputum did reveal MRSA as well as a line culture which grew out staph epi from the [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital which was MRSA as well.
We then eventually were able to obtain a swallow study which demonstrated that she was cleared for bedside food as long as it was pureed and thickened honey nectar food.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition, GU and renal.
Her electrolytes have been optimized and her creatinine is currently normal.
The patient's hematocrit was stable at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name (Titles) 620**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
The patient's hematocrit was stable.
White count peaked at 24,000 and has now decreased to 8.7 as of the 24th with a stable hematocrit of 34.
Coags revealed INR 1.3.
Peritoneal and urine cultures initially upon presentation at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name (Titles) 620**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] grew out E.coli which was pansensitive as did her urine.
Vancomycin is being continued for presumed line infection at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] from an A line which was infected as well as a sputum sample sent off at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] on the 17th which grew out MRSA.
Physical exam reveals that she has an abdominal wound which was left open postoperatively on the skin with good, clean, granulating tissue.
