Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
Also on this day she had a renal u/s done to assess renal status secondary to anuria and elevating creatinine.
HIT panel was done due to low platelets which came back negative and over hospital course platelets increased.
Over the next several days Ms. [**Known lastname 4379**] remained in the CSRU for continued invasive monitoring and evaluation for her renal failure.
She continued to make improvements and her creatinine peaked at 4.9 and slowly decreased to 2.0 by time of discharge.
Beta blockers were titrated for maximum BP and heart rate control.
Labs, VS and physical exam were stable.
