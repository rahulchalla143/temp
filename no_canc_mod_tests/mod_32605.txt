BNP was elevated and he was treated for acute systolic heart failure.
Echocardiogram showed moderate mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction 15%.
Cardiac catherization revealed coronary artery disease and he was referred for surgical revasulcarization.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
The increased heart rate made the systolic function appear better as well  REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
LVEF 25%.
He continued to progress, diuretics were adjusted, and beta blockers titrated for heart rate control.
Has been prescribed lasix for two weeks with plan to follow up with cardiologist prior to completion for evaluation of continued dosing of diuretics.
