At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, he had awoken with SOB, satting 89% on 3L NC, improved to 95% on mask at 5L.
Pt had a second episode of SOB overnight, satting 70-80% on mask at 8L and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-5-25**], the previously suspected thrombus on the pacing wire is not apparent on the current study.
# Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure:  The patient was hypoxic on admission with  SpO2 76% on NRB and an arterial blood gas of 7.34/66/53.
His acute hypoxia was felt to be due to diastolic heart failure, although CXR appeared to have mild pulmonary edema without significant change from [**4-22**].
However, repeat ECHO was without evidence of thrombus and there was no evidence of DVT on physical exam.
# Diastolic CHF:  The patient had an Echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] with evidence of mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and diastolic dysfunction.
On presentation this admission, the patient lacked overt volume overload on arrival and chest xray was not remarkably changed from previous exams.
However, BNP was elevated at 1203.
Blood pressure was noted to be 150/80 and the patient was given IV Lasix boluses and started on a Nitro gtt for blood pressure control.
Repeat ECHO showed little change since previous exam.
# HTN:  The patient was noted to be hypertensive during admission, with systolic blood pressures to the 160's/170's.
At the time of discharge, his blood pressure was in an acceptable range of 110's systolic.
Cardiac enzymes were unremarkable with troponin was slightly elevated in setting of chronic renal failure, possible demand ischemia from diastolic CHF.
# CRI (baseline Cr 1.3-1.7):  The patient had a history of chronic renal insufficiency and on arrival, his creatinine was at baseline.
# Parkinson's disease/Vascular Dementia/Depression:  The patient was maintained on his normal regiment of donepezil, Mirapex, bupropion HCl, and Celexa 20 mg.  His nightly trazodone dose was increased to 25mg QHS.
