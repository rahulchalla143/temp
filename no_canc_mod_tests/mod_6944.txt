Pt was 101 at one point in the ED.
An MRI prelim read was concerning for R hip osteomyelitis.
Renal osteodystrophy 5.

MRI Hip Read [**2132-11-14**]: 1.
ECHO [**2132-11-15**]: The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
PROCEDURE: IR guided R hip aspiration [**2132-11-14**]: Successful right hip joint aspiration of approximately 0.5 cc of viscous, cloudy joint fluid, which was sent for culture and Gram stain.
TEE [**2132-11-17**] Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
CTA CHEST, CT ABD/PELVIS [**2132-11-17**] IMPRESSION:  1.
Given no known history of trauma could represent an area of shunting  and an underlying lesion cannot be excluded, however, active hemorrhage within the lesion as well as more chronic fluid/ blood in the subcapsular space is also a consideration; recommend repeat CT examination with further timing delay for further characterization of this region.
CODE EVENT: ============ During her case, anesthesiology attending noted that it was difficult to record her blood pressure, so left a-line was placed with SBP 85-95.
Pt was transported to [**Month/Day (2) 13042**] where SBP 50-60.
Given phenylephrine, 100 mcg epinephrine with HR 130s, BP improved.
Phenylephrine gtt and levophed gtt started with BP 80/40s.
After CXR in [**Name (NI) 13042**], pt was awake, cooperative and stuck out tongue, squeezed hands.
EKG concerning for severe electrolyte disturbances vs. anterior iscemia (?STE V1-4).
On two occasions, pulse could not be determined and CPR commenced for 2-3 minutes with return of circulation.
Initially, was going to go to cardiac catherization for evaluation of coronaries (?RV infarct) and CTA, but on hold as pt decompensated.
Pt was then taken to CT for CT head, torso and CTA to provide prognostic information and assess for PE.
CTA was negative for PE.
CT abd/pelvis notable for liver hematoma.
