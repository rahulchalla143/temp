There was granulation tissue over the site of patient's previous intervention and a previous wound culture grew MSSA for which he had undergone a course of Keflex.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 **], a TEE was performed that showed a potential vegetation on the tricuspid valve vs. fibrous tissue from exposure to pacemaker leads.
[**Hospital3 **] microbiology records show that blood cultures drawn prior to the initation of antibiotics were all No Growth Final.
Blood cultures drawn here are NGTD.
Chest X-ray on [**2156-2-5**] confirmed that the tip of the PICC is in a central location.
His last symptom was diarrhea on the morning of [**2156-1-29**] and has been asymptomayic since.
