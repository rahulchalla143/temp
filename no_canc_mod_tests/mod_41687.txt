He complained of substernal chest pressure and EKG was mildly concerning for isolated ST elevation in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was ruled out for MI with serial troponins.
Work-up of his presentation included HIV serology, [**Doctor First Name **], "collagen vascular disease panel", dsDNA, which were all negative.
Leukocytosis worsened and imaging showed progression of a pneumonic process to include all right lung fields, along with evidence of volume overload with bibasilar crackles and worsening hypoxia, requiring NRB.
Repeat chest CT showed a large, loculated empyema with significant associated right lung atelectasis.
Thoracentesis yielded 20 cc of purulent pleural fluid.
Pleural fluid studies were consistent with an exudative process with elevated LDH to 7072.
Drainage was a total of 1L in 3 days.
Antibiotic course is currently vanc (day 4), Zosyn (day 3), and levoflox (day 6).
He continues to have good urine output and is neurologically intact and following commands when awake.

COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT of [**2165-9-7**] and chest CT of [**2165-9-11**].
TECHNIQUE:  Axial helical MDCT images were obtained from the suprasternal notch to the upper abdomen with administration of IV contrast and 1.25-mm slice collimation.
Multiplanar reformatted images in coronal and sagittal axes were generated.
Two chest tubes enter the pleural space between 9th and 10th ribs.
Right-sided lateral chest wall muscles are still edematous.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
He presented to OSH ED with dyspnea with CT showing RLL consolidation and small pleural effusion with thoracentesis at OSH and IV antibiotics given.
He developed rapid progression of pneumonic process despite IV abx to all right lung fields and development of a loculated empyema and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
He had extensive testing to determine the nature of the pericardial effusion, including HIV, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, RF which were all negative.
CRP was noted to be greater than assay and ESR was also elevated.
Repeat CXR showed consideral improvement.
He will have repeat CXR on [**2165-9-16**] with  subsequent removal of chest tubes by thoracics.
# Anemia of acute inflammation:  Baseline HCT is 43 with HCT 28.7 on admission.
