Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Head CT [**12-24**]: 1.
FINDINGS: Redemonstrated centered within the right temporal lobe, there is an area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage that is now slightly decreased in size measuring 3.9 x 1.9 cm, where on similar measurements on the most recent prior examination it measured 4.6 x 2.2 cm.
Hemorrhage seen extending to involve the fourth ventricle on the prior examination, is less conspicuous on today's examination.
She was taken to OSH where CT showed R SDH and R temporal hemorrhagic contusion.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Her repeat Head CT in the morning showed a slight worsening of her IPH.
Her exam also slightly worsened, as she no longer followed commands or moved her LE with commands.
Overnight she was noted on telemetry to be in atrial fib with a rate in the 120s which spontaneously resolved.
Then, on AM rounds, her HR was as high as 160 and the patient's SBP was 67.
She was bolused 250cc and her SBP increased into the 90s but her HR remained 120-140.
Of note, the patient had a CT chest which was read as 'Multifocal calcified and noncalcified nodules with associated fibrosis,  bronchiectasis, and patchy opacification most consistent with chronic  mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection.
She had recent CT of chest prior to her hospilalization and had PFTs she was scheduled to f/u with pulm this week.
She had episode of Afib with RVR with rates 120s-160s leading to hypotension that responded to fluids.
Patient has multiple reasons to have afib; she is predisposed with longstanding hypertension, she is acutely ill and has a head injury, she also had a high WBC count and positive U/A and she had electrolyte abnormalities.
ECHO done on [**12-24**] showed no structural heart disease and no focal WMA but did show diastolic dysfunction.
She will be reacess by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and have repeat CT in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he will give further recs for ASA or other types of anticoagulation.
Repeat head CT on [**12-27**] showed mild increase in ventricular size, but sl.
As per neurosurg, she had repeat head CT that showed overall stable appearance of multicompartmental hemorrhage without increase in ventricular caliber.
She failed her swallow eval x 2 which may be r/t brain injury.
Neuro-surgery will continue to follow and she has appointment on [**2121-2-3**] with neuro surge and for repeat CT. - Cont dilantin 100mg TID with weekly levels - Will need to have continue  PT, OT and re-eval of her swallowing - F/u w/ neurosurgery in [**Month (only) **] - No anticoagulation for now (including ASA) until re-evaluated by neurosurg in [**Name (NI) **] - Pt has staples on left side of skull from laceration and should be removed on Sunday [**1-4**] .
She had increase in WBC from 11.8->16.7 on [**12-27**], pt was hypothermic on that AM with temp of 95F.
WBC now WNL.
She was started on ceftriaxone 1gm Q24hours on [**12-27**] and then switched to cipro once sensitivities were available (today is day 6 of antibiotics), she will only need two more doses of antibiotics.

Her Hct has been stable on the low 30s.
-Cont to monitor HCT .
- Changed tylenol from standing to PRN - Would repeat LFTs in [**2-19**] days .
