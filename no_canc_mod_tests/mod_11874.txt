He was ultimately evaluated by his cardiologist, with a cardiac catheterization as well as an echocardiogram, and the cardiac catheterization data revealed three vessel coronary artery disease with severe left ventricular dysfunction.
Cardiac echocardiogram data actually showed mitral valve prolapse with moderate mitral regurgitation and the ejection fraction was approximately 40 to 45%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On presentation, he had a blood pressure of 126/63, heart rate 56, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 98%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was unremarkable.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Left dorsalis pedis was nonpalpable and the right Dopplerable, posterior tibial was palpable on the left and right, radial was also palpable left and right.
Postoperative ejection fraction was noted to be approximately 35% by transesophageal echocardiogram, with 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation.
His postoperative laboratories included a white count of 15,000, hematocrit of 33, platelets 110, potassium 4.6, calcium 1.09.
BUN and creatinine were normal.
The patient had his chest tubes removed on postoperative day one.
His laboratories were remarkable for a hematocrit of 27, down from 33, white count stable at 15, BUN and creatinine 32 and 1.3, up from .9 postoperatively.
His Lopressor was titrated accordingly to 25 mg twice a day for heart rates of 80s to 90s that were in sinus.
His hematocrit drop was felt to be secondary to postoperative state, and revascularization as well as chest tube losses.
His hematocrit was watched and, on postoperative day number three, his hematocrit was stable at 26.
The remainder of his electrolytes were unremarkable.
His renal function was preserved, with a creatinine of 1.1.
