Of note she was recently seen in her nephrology clinic on [**2117-6-30**] at which time her blood pressure was 150/90 with HR 68.
In the ED, her initial vital signs were 104  140  60/palp 16 86% on 100%.
A CXR, CT head/torso were done.
Family History: Unremarkable  Physical Exam: T 99.9 HR  133 BP 74/37  RR 30  O2sat 100% vent: AC 450x20 PEEP 5 FIO2 0.7 PIP 16 GEN: intubated HEENT: AT, NC, PERRLA (4->2mm bilat), no conjuctival injection, anicteric, OP clear, MMM, Neck supple, no LAD, no carotid bruits.
PSYCH: unable to assess   Pertinent Results: [**2117-7-4**] CXR - 1.
[**2117-7-4**] CT torso - 1.
[**2117-7-4**] CT head - Limited study without evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**2117-7-6**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1.
[**2117-7-6**] CT Right lower extremity: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
# Septic shock: [**2-27**] serratia bacteremia presumably from GI source given pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis.
Shock requiring max dose 4 pressors on presentation and she was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids until blood cultures grew serratia bacteremia.
Also cardiogenic in setting of sepsis as EF was severely depressed on initial echo obtained upon presentation to the ED (since normalized s/p treatment of sepsis).
CT right LE was negative for fluid collection/abscess/air.
General surgery and dermatology were consulted and deep tissue biopsy did not show e/o nec fasciitis however did also grow serratia to lesser degree than in blood.
# Fungemia:  [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans grew from [**7-19**] blood cultures presumably from line source as initial cultures were drawn from tunnelled line.
Surveillance cultures were monitored without subsequent growth after initial positive.
She was started on coumadin, and the heparin gtt until INR [**2-28**].
She did have bloody oral secretions but not enough to lose that amount of blood (23.5-->19).
Her HCT remained stable.
Repeat bronchoscopy did not show any areas of frank bleeding, and it was thought to be secondary to trauma from the tube.
Her HCT remained stable.
In the setting of fungemia, however, her tunnelled line was discontinued and her UOP continued to improve.
