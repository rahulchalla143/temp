Please refer to CT cervical spine for description of fractures at the lower cervical spine, which are better assessed on that study.
[**2148-10-16**] Head CT :.
Multiple fractures, better demonstrated on the recent dedicated maxillofacial CT study.
[**2148-10-17**] Cardiac echo : The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
[**2148-10-18**] Head CT :  Further slight interval increase in size of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, now measuring 3.3 x 3.3 cm, previously 3.2 x 2.9 cm.
[**2148-10-19**] Head CT : Unchanged right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild perihemorrhagic edema without significant mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 14738**] was admitted to the Trauma ICU for neuro checks and evaluation by plastic surgery and maxillofacial surgery for his multiple facial fractures.
He had serial Head CT's done to evaluate his right frontal bleed and although he had no change in his neurologic exam he did have a small increase in his right frontal bleed but no mass effect or shift.
His last CT scan was on [**2148-10-19**] and was unchanged.
Following repletion of his potassium his ectopy resolved and a cardiac echo was done which revealed a normal EF and no wall motion abnormalities.
Of note he had a routine type and screen done on admission which showed an anti K antibody.
In the future he will need K antigen negative products.
A wallet card and paperwork from the blood bank will be mailed to his home.
Will need a CT myelogram of R shoulder scheduled prior to the appointment.
Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 8 weeks (neurosurgery) You needs a non-contrast head CT and a non-contrast C-spine CT at that time so let the secretary know when you call.
