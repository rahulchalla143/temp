She remained in the ICU and while off renal replacement therapy, her BUN and creatinine continued to rise, however her urine output was approximately 1.5 liters daily.
On POD 3 her BUN was 117, and prograf level was 15.
TSH was sent, result was 7.4 and levothyroxine was started.
AST and ALT have trended down to normal, however the alk phos which initially w starting to normalize, had started to trend back up into the 400s, and the total bilirubin which peaked at 16.1 while in the ICU, has trended down, but not normalized.
On POD 14, due to these findings, an ERCP was performed showing mild diffuse dilation at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 10 mm.
A balloon sweep was performed through the anastomotic site with minimal resistance.
An occlusion cholangiogram revealed extravasation of contrast most likely from the right hepatic system consistent with a high grade bile leak.
TSH was checked and found to be elevated at 7.3 with T4 of 7.1.
An ultrasound/duplex of liver was done to assess for collection.
Cell count had wbc of 2750 with 82 polys.
This fluid bilirubin level was 17.
Culture was negative.
On [**4-30**] hepatic angiogram was performed via right groin approach with limited contrast used due to creatinine elevation of 1.7.
On [**5-1**], repeat angiogram was done with successful stent placement.
Total bilirubin continued to decrease, however, alk phos continued to remain in the mid 400 range.
Two units of PRBC were transfused with Hct increase to 27.
An abdominal CT was done to evaluate for bleeding.
CT demonstrated the following: Large subcapsular liver collection that is likely not being drained by the pigtail catheter in place at the inferior aspect of the liver.
On [**5-5**], CT guided placement of an 8 French drain was placed into the the right perihepatic collection.
Gram stain of fluid was no organisms or PMNs, culture was negative.
Repeat culture was sent on drain fluid showing 1+ PMN with culture negative to date.
TSH in 6 weeks.
