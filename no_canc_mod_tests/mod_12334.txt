Because of her scapula pain, she was referred for a stress test in late [**2184-2-3**] which showed some 'changes'.
Per note from NEBH, patient had inferolateral ischemia on ETT (4minutes) with reproduction of symptoms.
Because of these changes she was sent for cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 **] which showed 90% stenosis to the LAD and she is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for intervention with cath in the AM.
At NEBH, WBC 9.8, HCT 37.6, PLT 152, Na 141, K 5.0, Cl 102, CO2 32, Glucose 88, BUN 30, Cr 0.9, Ca 8.9.

ETT performed on [**2-/2184**] demonstrated inferolateral ischemia on ETT (4minutes) with reproduction of symptoms.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2184-3-15**] demonstrated: 90% stenosis of LAD.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 88 year old female with PMH of HTN, colon cancer s/p resection, presents from NEBH s/p cardiac catheterization which demonstrated 90% stenosis of [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and intervention of LAD.
Stress test done 2-3 weeks ago showed inferolateral ischemia with reproduction of symptoms.
Cardiac cath showed 90% occlusion of LAD.
Serial hematocrits were obtained and no further drops were observed.
Colon Ca - Patient is s/p resection, no history of recurrence.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a cardiac catheterization and received a stent to one of your arteries.
