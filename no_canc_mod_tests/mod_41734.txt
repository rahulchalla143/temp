CXR showed left basilar PTX and urgent chest tube was placed by CT surgery.
CT chest showed large bulla in [**1-12**] of RLL of lung.
Pleurodesis was performed [**2156-6-2**].
He is on -40 wall suction on 1st chest tube, and -20 on 2nd chest tube.
CXR showed RLL infiltrate and he was started on vanco/cefepime for HCAP, although f/u xray showed chronic changes and antibiotics were stopped.
CT showed SBO but he refused NG tube per the discharge summary (per the patient, he agreed and the team couldn't get it in and he refused to let them try again).

Given that this is the admission radiograph and that the morphologic feature is complex, CT is recommended to obtain a better assessment of the complex morphology and a valid baseline for further followups.
-CT head ([**2156-6-19**]): 1.
Further workup with MRI might be considered.
-Right shoulder plain film ([**2156-6-19**]): There are no signs for acute fractures or dislocations.
-Pelvis ([**2156-6-19**]): Single view of the pelvis demonstrates no displaced fractures or dislocations.
Brief Hospital Course: MR. [**Known lastname 106556**] is a 63 yo M with endstage COPD who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 2177**] for evaluation for a bronchial valve to help treat his bullous emphysema which had resulted in pneumothoraces whose goals of care were shifted to comfort measures only during this hospitalization, and he expired on [**2156-6-22**].
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation by interventional pulmonary.
His CXR showed bullae in the left and right lung.
The plan was to get a CT abd/pelvis to further evaluate however given that he was unable to lie flat this was not performed and was not pursued given his change in GOC.
#Fall abd subdural hemorrhage- Early on HD4, the patient tried to leave his room while he was delirious and had a fall with head strike.
Head CT showed a 2.5mm frontal subdural hematoma.
He did not have any major apparent neurological sequelae of this subdural (pupils remained reactive and equal, moving all extremities) and no repeat imaging was obtained after his GOC were changed to [**Date Range 3225**].
