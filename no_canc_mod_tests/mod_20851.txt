The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed left main severe three vessel coronary artery disease and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for coronary artery bypass grafting.
LABORATORY:  Preoperative laboratory data significant for a hematocrit of 38.7, a BUN of 15 and a creatinine of 0.5.
The patient underwent an ultrasound of the carotids which showed a 60% right internal carotid artery stenosis, an occluded left common and left internal carotid artery.
Recommendations were made to start the patient on low dose beta blocker and plans were made for an Electrophysiology Service study due to the patient's low ejection fraction and ventricular ectopy.
The patient had an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 30%, dilated right and left atrium, moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, one to two plus mitral regurgitation and one to two plus tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient was taken to the Electrophysiology Laboratory for Electrophysiology studies which were negative for any inducible ventricular tachycardia.
The patient's hematocrit was noted to be 25; he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
TSH was noted to be elevated at 7.4 and it was felt that no therapy was needed but it would be recommended that the patient have his TSH rechecked again in one month.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Temperature maximum 98.6 F.; pulse 84 in atrial fibrillation; blood pressure 104/62; respiratory rate 16; room air oxygen saturation of 98%.
White blood cell count 5.7, hematocrit 26.1, platelet count 378.
Sodium 140, potassium 4.9, chloride 106, bicarbonate 25, BUN 13, creatinine 0.8, glucose 89.
The patient's PT is 14.1 and INR 1.3.
Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously twice a day until INR greater than 2.0.
The patient's INR is to be checked on [**2-20**] and further Coumadin dosing is to be per Dr.[**Name (NI) 54594**] office.
