MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix, Prinivil, Diltiazem, Coumadin, Aspirin, Atenolol, Flecainide, Trazodone, Valium, Effexor, Duragesic, Neurontin, Ambien, Glipizide, Combivent, Bactrim, Claritin, Tylenol #3, Actos, Colace, Glyburide, Glargine, Imuran, Folate, Prednisone, Vioxx and Protonix.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, temperature 99.8, pulse 95, blood pressure 110/85, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 95% on 2 liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat showed dry mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, sclera were anicteric.
Jugulovenous pressure was not elevated.
Cardiac examination showed an irregularly irregular rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities, 2+ distal pulses, no edema, cyanosis, jaundice or clubbing.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission revealed white blood cell count 14.6, hematocrit 21.1, differential on white blood cell count 93% neutrophils, 5% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes.
PT 24.1, PTT 27.2, INR 4.0.
Urinalysis was negative.
Chemistries, sodium 141, potassium 6.0 which was hemolyzed and falsely elevated the potassium value, chloride 97, bicarbonate 36, BUN 66, creatinine 1.2, glucose 253.
ALT 17, AST 29, creatinine kinase 61, alkaline phosphatase 47, amylase 94, total bilirubin 0.1, lipase 44, CKMB 1, troponin less than 0.3.
The patient subsequently decompensated after her second bowel movement with a blood pressure drop down to 86/46, became tachycardiac to 110, respiratory rate increased to 24 and her oxygen saturation decreased to 80%.
The patient was successfully intubated and arterial blood gases showed pH of 7.32/34/32.
Her systolic blood pressure dropped to 60 and her heartrate then increased to 120.
Repeat hematocrit in the MICU showed a drop to 10.5.
Chest x-ray showed increased right lobe opacity.
She was started on Vancomycin following gram positive cocci on sputum gram stain and blood cultures.
Sputum cultures subsequently grew out Pseudomonas and Ceftazidime was added.
with hematocrit checks, anticoagulation was avoided secondary to the risk of recurrent bleed.
Follow up esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy was performed.
Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis of the descending colon and sigmoid colon and was otherwise normal.
Infectious disease - The patient's fever curve and white blood cell count gradually decreased while she was on the floor.
Endocrine - The patient has Type 2 diabetes, blood sugars were monitored four times per day, regular insulin sliding scale was used as needed.
Renal - Her BUN and creatinine levels were within normal limits.
