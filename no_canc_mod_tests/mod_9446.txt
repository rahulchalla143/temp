A UA was checked and was negative for infection.
Physical Exam: VS: 98.0 BP 146/92 HR 104 RR 20 O2sat 99% RA Gen: thin appearing female, in mild distress from pain HEENT:MMM dry.
Pertinent Results: hapto, fibrinogen wnl [**8-31**] LFTs [**8-31**] wnl, albumin 2.2 [**9-1**]: FeNa 0.2%, FeUrea 21% .
UA [**9-1**]: 100 pro, few LE, 9wbc, few bacteria, 5 epi, 17 hyaline casts UCx negative .
CXR [**9-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR PA/Lat [**8-31**]: b/l bases with consolidation in setting of elevated diaphragm/pneumoperitoneum more likely Atx rather than PNA, tiny b/l pleural effusions, increased on R side .
CXR [**9-3**]: 1) Small bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged since previous study.
CT noncontrast a/p: Diffuse pneumoperitineum and air in the gastrohepatic ligament is most likely post operative.
Brief Hospital Course:      37 year-old female with poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus type I and known severe gastroparesis presented [**2143-8-24**] with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
CT scan of the abdomen showed intussusception of her duodenum into her stomach, with gastric outlet obstruction.
Her reglan was titrated down and compazine was discontinued to avoid dyskinesias.
She underwent EGD with duodenal biopsies, antral biopsies, and jejunal biopsies, which were all negative for sprue or other abnormalities.
EGD showed esophagitis.
Also with acute renal failure, with creatinine up from baseline of 0.9 to 1.5 on [**9-1**], and delirium, thought to be secondary to dehydration, opiates, fatigue, acute renal failure, C diff infection.
She was found to have a large A-a gradient (>500) in the setting of a multifocal process on CXR.
Given that blood transfusion was give prior to the onset of respiratory distress, patient was initially suspected to have TRALI.
Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed and unrevealing.
Mechanical ventilation was stopped, and patient expired soon after.
