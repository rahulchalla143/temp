On arrival to the ED, she was found to have an O2 sat of 68% on  2.5 Lbut her VS were otherwise stable (T 98.6, HR 85, RR 30 BP 138/66).
An EKG was performed and by report demonstrated new TWi in III,avF (new); this EKG is uanavilable.
She was later placed on a 50% ventimask and had an O2 sat of 96% at that time.
A CXR was also performed and was negative for any acute process and no evidence of hyperinflation.
Of note, during her prior hospitalization, she was found to have  a room air sat in the 70s% and 75% on 2L.

There is no correlation with pulse oximetry at these settings.
On initial exam she had minimal wheezing, but ~10 lb weight gain and fine crcakles bilaterally.
Patient was transferred to the floor and her exam was consistent with volume overload.
Her O2 saturations improved to 90-92% on 3L NC, with abmulatory saturations of 90-92% requiring 4L on flat ground and 4-6L NC for ambulation up a flight of stairs to maintain O2 sat > 92%.
Her discharge weight was 269 lbs.
Patient had clean coronaries on catheterization in [**2120**].
An official interpretation of ECG showed RAD, RV Hypertrophy and diffuse ST/T changes without interim change from [**2124-2-21**].
