Emergency Medical Services found the patient awake with a respiratory rate of 40 to 50, diaphoretic with an O2 saturation in the 80s and blood pressure about 150/80; heart rate 120 to 165, and complaining of palpitations.
At that time, an EKG there showed rapid atrial fibrillation and labs there were notable for a CK of 279, MB of 27.6, and troponin of 1.2, as well as a D-Dimer of greater than 1000.
Blood gas there on an FIO2 of 1.0, 7.3, 35 and 65.
Repeat blood gas at that time showed 7.32, 44, 54.
In the Emergency Department, they attempted to obtain a chest CT angiogram but were unable to do so secondary to body habitus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs on presentation were blood pressure of 168/99; heart rate in the 140s in atrial fibrillation; the patient was intubated with O2 saturation of approximately 98%; temperature taken a few hours later was noted to be 99.4 F.  On examination, the patient was intubated, sedated, does not respond to stimuli.
Anterior and laterally they were clear to auscultation with distant breath sounds.
He had two plus pulses, the most vibrant of which were the dorsalis pedis pulses which were palpated easily.
LABORATORY:  Initially, the patient had a white blood cell count of 13.8, hemoglobin and hematocrit of 14.3 and 44.4, platelet count of 400.
Differential showed 81 neutrophils, no bands, 15 lymphocytes.
Chem 7 was a sodium of 140, potassium 3.6, chloride 101, bicarbonate 24, BUN 24, creatinine 1.2, glucose 247, calcium 8.9, magnesium 1.6, phosphorus 4.0, coagulation studies were PT 14.2, INR 1.3, PTT 28.2.
CK of 1607 and troponin of 4.12.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 140 beats per minute, left axis deviation and intraventricular conduction delay, left ventricular hypertrophy, no ST changes were noted.
The possibilities initially included pulmonary embolism, aspiration incident, development of a pneumonia, particularly given his brief hospital stay, and acute myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema, or pulmonary edema due to rapid atrial fibrillation.
Initially, it was attempted to get a CT scan to look for pulmonary embolism, however, we were unable to obtain one because of the patient's body habitus and it was considered to be less likely just given the findings of an acute myocardial infarction and the fact that the patient was in rapid atrial fibrillation on presentation.
Also, on his initial chest x-ray there was a question of an increasing right lower lobe infiltrate which led to the possibility that the patient had acquired a Nosocomial pneumonia during his hospital stay.
Early on in his hospital stay, the patient had a bronchoscopy and the bronchial alveolar lavage in the secretions he was able to obtain had a Gram stain of Gram positive cocci, however, the cultures were negative from this, possibly due to colonization already covering with antibiotics.
The patient did have a pulmonary artery catheter placed to help determine the etiology of his shock and importantly, it showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25, central venous pressure of approximately 16, although his cardiac output was 7.85 and his SVR was 673.
This led us to believe that there was probably some element of cardiogenic shock given elevated wedge pressure, however, there was a significant component of septic shock validity to increased cardiac output and the SVR on the lower side.
It was felt that the falling hematocrit represented more danger to the patient than the stroke risks or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, so the heparin was not restarted temporarily.
For his coronary artery disease, the patient was maintained on aspirin, Plavix, Metoprolol, originally Isordil and hydralazine and the hydralazine was then changed to Captopril once his creatinine reached its baseline level, and Lipitor was added later in the hospital course.
Therefore, a head CT scan was obtained which showed the old left parietal infarction as well as some hyperdensity in the right temporal lobe.
It was unclear at this time whether this represented a subarachnoid hemorrhage or question of meningioma, therefore a repeat CT scan was done the next day which showed unchanging of this lesion.
It was felt by Neurology, who was consulted on the case, that this was unlikely to represent hemorrhage and it also did not correlate clinically with the patient's right hemiparesis; therefore, initially the heparin was held because of this and no further work-up was done.
Any further work-up will be delayed until the patient is more stable and probably as an outpatient.
Towards the third week of his hospitalization, around [**11-19**], the patient's mental status improved greatly.
A CK was done at the time which was normal and his mental status was just watched over time to see that it would improve and how his strength would improved.
Towards his third week of hospitalization, the patient did have a significant drop in his hematocrit of about six points which was felt to be due to an expanding hematoma towards the area of cardiac catheterization which was done approximately a week earlier, therefore, an ultrasound was obtained which is pending at the time of this dictation.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:   The patient was kept on tube feeds for most of his hospital course which were discontinued for approximately a few days due to significant ileus which did resolve.
The patient was fed with these tube feeds through an OG tube and when he is more stable will be obtaining a Swallow evaluation to try to re-institute p.o.
No clots were noted in that area and eventually all central venous access was discontinued with his fevers and a right PICC line was able to be obtained.
He was experiencing continued fevers and infection, possibly from pneumonia, possibly from line sepsis, but not having any abdominal pain to give consideration for a work-up of acalculous cholecystitis.
An addendum will be made, including follow-up plans and overall discharge medications.
