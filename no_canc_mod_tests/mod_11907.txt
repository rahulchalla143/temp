Her oxygen saturations were transiently in the 70s.
She was then placed on supplemental oxygen at which time her saturations improved to the 90s, but she then desaturated again on a nonrebreather mask.
Given her continued hypoxemia, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.
Upon arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient's blood pressure was stable at 142/62 with a heart rate of 102.
She was in mild respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 24 and was saturating 96% on 4 liters.
Her blood pressure stabilized; however, she then developed increased shortness of breath.
She was then admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and stabilization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination revealed vital signs with a temperature of 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 98/49, her heart rate was 93, her respiratory rate was 23, and her oxygen saturation was 95%.
General physical examination revealed an obese and lethargic female.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Neck examination revealed the neck was supple.
Cardiovascular examination revealed distant heart sounds.
The lung examination revealed coarse breath sounds bilaterally with diminished air movement in the right upper lobe.
Extremity examination revealed 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient responded to simple commands.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 7.8, her hematocrit was 32.8, and her platelets were 192.
The patient's sodium was 136, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 95, bicarbonate was 32, blood urea nitrogen was 18, and her creatinine was 0.9.
Urinalysis was negative.
Arterial blood gas revealed 7.31/57/86.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was consistent with increased fluid overload and congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 102.
The patient's examination on admission was consistent with shock, and there was concern that the patient might be septic.
The patient was started on levofloxacin and clindamycin initially, and her cultures were followed.
Her blood pressure remained stable following the initial fluid bolus.
Cultures were followed, and no organism was isolated.
The patient was thought to likely have a bronchitis, as no clear infiltrate was every isolated on her chest x-rays.
A subsequent chest x-ray did show significant fluid overload.
The plan was for the patient to have cardiac followup as an outpatient when her current symptoms had stabilized.
HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient's blood pressure medications were initially held on admission given concern for sepsis and her initial hypotension.
However, her blood pressure stabilized, and as she actually did become hypertensive at this point, she was started back on her verapamil and dyazide per her home regimen which she tolerated well.
She was received prophylaxis with a CIWA scale; however, the patient did not need the criteria for alcohol withdrawal, and this was discontinued.
