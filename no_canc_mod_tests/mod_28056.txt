She was found to be hyperkalemic with an EKG showing widened QRS and peaked T waves.
Here, she was found to have a K of 7, and was treated with bicarb, Ca, insulin and glucose.
She was also noted to have an elevation in cardiac enzymes (CK 1440->1348, MB 27-23, MBI 1.9-1.7, Trop 0.39) and new [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] cardiology was consulted.
At cath, she was noted to have 3+ MR< LVEF of 40%, and severe inferior hypokinesis.
She had two stents placed to the mid-LAD, but during the procedure she vomited coffee-ground emesis and the catheterization was terminated.
Past Medical History: h/o GIB in the past, as above DM not on insulin since [**5-19**] infection ESRD secondary to PCKD, with HD qMWF s/p renal transplant several years ago HTN, not medically treated since [**5-19**] infection h/o line infection [**5-19**]   Social History: Married with children  Physical Exam: On arrival in MICU: Afebrile SBP 80s-100s on pressors RR10, 100% O2 on CMV at 40% FiO2 Gen: Intubated, sedated, nonresponsive HEENT: mmm, OP benign, PERRL CV: RRR systolic murmur Resp: coarse breath sounds bilaterally anteriorly Abd: obese, NABS, soft, nondistended Ext: edematous, warm.
See Neuro note for complete exam when patient awake (prior to intubation)  Pertinent Results: **SELECTED STUDIES**  SPINE MRI: IMPRESSION: Endplate irregularity and enhancement at T7-8 level is suggestive of discitis.
Dual energy gallium/bone scan would be helpful for further evaluation.
MRI HEAD ([**10-6**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited study consisting only of DWI and FLAIR sequences.
CXR: ([**10-7**]): A single portable chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular heads.
Right hilar contour is unchanged from previous study of [**2137-10-4**].
Abd/pelvic CT ([**10-7**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO ([**10-8**]): Conclusions: 1.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2137-9-25**], there has been no significant change.
EEG ([**10-8**]): IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to overall slowing suggestive of a diffuse moderate encephalopathy with superimposed bursts and runs of sharp and slow, spike and slow discharges suggesting marked increase to irritability overall.
She received antibiotics and antivrials to treat possible infections; her MRI was suggestive of HSV encephalitis although CSF cultures were negative, and only one set of sputum cultures ([**9-28**]) were positive, with no positive blood cultures.
An abdominal CT showed no source of infection, there was no pneumonia seen on chest x-rays and no sign of thrombophlebitis on US.
Her LFTs showed no suggestion of hepatic or biliary infection.
ECHOs showed good cardiac function, making cardiogenic shock unlikely.
After a time of extreme hypotension (SBPs 20s) and bradycardia, and after further discussion with her family, the ventilator was turned off and she passed away.
* Mental Status changes: After her first extubation in the CCU the patient was noted to have an asymmetric neuro exam, with concern for CVA but head CT negative.
An MRI was suggestive of temporal lobe enhancement suggesting HSV encephalitis and the patient was maintained on acyclovir.
An LP yielded no organisms in culture.
EEG showed severe encephalopathy without seizure.
Repeat ECHOs showed good EF (>55%) and no abnormalities to explain the patient's persistant hypotension.
* GI Bleed - The patient had  a h/o GIB, and was on multiple meds for cath that were anticoagulants, so the GIB not surprising.
There were no more episodes of vfib or arrythmia during admission and the patient received stents with ECHOs showing good function.
Electrolytes were monitored daily.
*Renal failure/hyperkalemia - She was followed by the renal team and maintained on CVVH as her blood pressure permitted.
*DM - She was monitored closely and treated with an insulin drip.
