At that time the EKG revealed diffuse T wave inversions in the precordial leads.
She was going to be a direct admission to the floor but she had recurrent chest pain and was admitted to the cardiac catheterization lab.
Immediately post procedure she had an EKG demonstrating AIVR with right bundle branch block morphology which resolved.
Then upon arrival to the holding area, she had a bradycardic episode with systolic blood pressure decrease and unresponsiveness.
Prior to this, her EKG had persistent precordial T wave inversions with prolonged PR intervals.
During her rest she had a brief course of chest compression and was subsequently given Atropine which brought her blood pressure up to the 100 systolic and her pulse  up to 90.
She subsequently had recurrent chest pain [**1-20**] and bedside echo revealed no effusion.
Hematocrit was 41 pre-procedure.
Repeat was 27, although she had no physical evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
In CCU her blood pressures remained stable with systolic blood pressure in the 120's to 130's and a repeat hematocrit was done while we were waiting for the type and cross which returned at 32.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Showed vital signs with temperature 97.0, heart rate 77, blood pressure 122/63, respiratory rate 15, 100% on two liters nasal cannula.
Lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, 2+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission were significant for her initial hematocrit of 42.8, but repeat at 17:46 was 27.1 and then at 19:15 was 32.6.
Her ESR was 25, her CK was 87, troponin less than .3.
Her echocardiogram showed an EF of 45-50% with mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] pulmonary hypertension.
Cath showed a wedge of 12.
RCA showed 60% mid lesion, 90% tubular lesion at the bifurcation into short PDA and posterior left ventricular branch.
Left circumflex showed a tubular 50-60% lesion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  56-year-old female with remote history of SLE, positive family history for coronary artery disease presents with crescendo angina and EKG with diffuse T wave inversion, status post catheterization showing three vessel disease with a stent to the LAD.
Post cath was complicated by a question of a vagal episode with bradycardia and a hematocrit drop from 42 to 32, likely delusional, however, there was concern for retroperitoneal hematoma.
She was continued on Aspirin and Plavix and started on Pravastatin for an LDL of 150 and HDL of 60.
