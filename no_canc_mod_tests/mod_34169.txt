He had a CT on [**2104-5-21**] showing a perforated sigmoid diverticular abscess with involvement of the bladder wall.
He had a cystoscopy on [**2104-5-23**], which showed a likely colovesicular fistular at the bladder dome, as well as a small lesion at the trigone, which was biopsied and found to be nonmalignant, reactive urithelium.
He was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2104-5-24**] for urinary retention, abdominal pain, and fever.
The following morning Troponins were 0.63 and CK was 424, peaking at 1.57 on [**2104-5-28**].
His Cr was 1.1 on [**2104-5-27**], steadily increasing over the next few days to a peak Cr of 4.3 on [**2104-5-31**].
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-6-3**] for further cardiac workup and possible fistula repair surgery.
On arrival to the floor he was clear, coherent, and chest pain free with vitals of T 98.5, BP 187/97, HR 74, RR 20, and SpO2 99% on 4L NC.
Blood pressures were reportedly as high as 200/100 at the OSH, and he was reportedly on an Esmolol drip for a brief period, but later titrated to Metoprolol 200 mg PO BID.

OSH IMAGING: Abdominal CT - colovesicular fistula likely secondary to sigmoid divericuli.
ETT ([**2103-1-23**]): He underwent a nuclear stress test on [**2103-1-23**] where he was able to exercise 6 minutes 35 seconds to a maximum heart rate of 113 bpm.
Nuclear imaging revealed an inferior wall MI, mild ischemia in the in the mid to basal septum, inferior and septal hypokinesis, LV systolic dysfunction and an EF of 45%.
Echocardiogram ([**2103-1-2**]): Echocardiogram from [**2103-1-2**] revealed a slightly enlarged LA and aortic root, normal systolic function of both ventricles, and LVEF of 75%.
CARDIAC CATH ([**1-/2103**]): PTCA COMMENTS: Initial angiography showed recurrent severe (80-90%) ostial LCX stenosis followed by diffuse (60-70%) proximal LCX disease.
We performed serial inflations staring with 1.5x15 Maverick balloon (at 10-12 ATM), 2.5x15 mm Voyager at 8-12 ATM) and 3.0x15 mm Voyager (at 7-14 ATM).
Final angiography showed 0% residual stenosis with TIMI 3 flow and no dissection or distal emboli.

RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 11.4 cm.
[**2104-6-15**] CT Abd : Progression of segmental diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon with regional focal contained perforation.
He had a CT on [**2104-5-21**] showing a perforated sigmoid diverticular abscess with involvement of the bladder wall.
He had a cystoscopy on [**2104-5-23**], which showed a likely colovesicular fistular at the bladder dome, as well as a small lesion at the trigone, which was biopsied and found to be nonmalignant, reactive urithelium.
He was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2104-5-24**] for urinary retention, abdominal pain, and fever.
His hospital course was complicated by continued fever, sepsis, and a subsequent NSTEMI due to demand ischemia with a Troponin of 1.57 at its peak.
He also developed [**Last Name (un) **], likely due to ischemic ATN, with a peak Cr 4.3 on [**2104-5-31**].
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac workup and fistula repair surgery.
He received cardiac and renal clearance for his surgery, which is planned for [**2104-6-12**].
CT images and reports from the OSH were obtained and uploaded.
Blood and urine cultures showed no growth.
Echo on [**2104-6-4**] showed probable inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis with an LVEF of 45-50%.
He does need aggressive BP and heart rate control to reduce strain on his heart.
# HTN: He had elevated blood pressures up to SBP 200 at OSH.
He was started on a Nitro drip on admission, but maintained SBP 126-171 overnight on [**2104-6-4**] without the drip.
His blood pressures stabilized by [**2104-6-7**] on a combination of Metoprolol 200 mg PO BID, Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily, Hydralazine 25 mg PO Q6H, and Nitro Patch 0.2 mg/hr.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: The patient's Cr was 3.2 on admission, significantly improved from a maximum of 4.3 at OSH, but still increased from a baseline Cr of 1.0 on [**2103-3-30**] in our system.
Urine and serum lytes showed UNa 75, UCr 63, SNa 146, SCr 3.1 giving FENa 2.53%, which is consistent with ATN.
His urine was positive for rare eosinophils.
Repeat urine lytes on [**2104-6-9**] showed a FENa of 3.04% and FEUrea of 69.72% with urine osmolality 333, urea 390, Cr 51, Na 72, K 15, and Cl 63.
His Cr remained fairly stable in the range 3.0-3.3 since admission.
His Hct on [**2104-6-5**] was recorded as 33.1, close to a previous value of 32.1 on [**2103-3-30**].
Anemia labs including iron panel, B12, folate, retic count, and repeat Hct were sent to work up his anemia.
The anemia workup was consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
After starting IV fluids on [**2104-6-8**], his Hct dropped to 28.6, likely due to hemodilution.
His Hct stayed below 30 on subsequent labs, and he was given 1 unit of blood on [**2104-6-9**], with a smaller Hct increase than expected.
It was recommended to consider transfusing again for Hct <30.
An active type and screen was kept on file during his stay.
Stool C.diff toxin assay was sent and was negative.
Urine leakage into the colon from his fistula was another possible contributing factor.
His diarrhea improved after admission, but worsened again after resuming PO intake of clears and full liquids.
However, he required only minimal insulin during his stay since his glucose levels usually remained within a normal range.
During preoperative preparation there was concern that the NGT placement attempt had created a false passage.
Pt's post-extubation course was largely unremarkable with excellent pain control, nutritional support, continued dvt and pud prophylaxis, and improving physical exam and clinical picture.
One outstanding issue was blood pressure control with transient pressures as high as 170/100 which continued to be refractory to home dose metoprolol and amlodipine.
Based on your medical records and evaluation in the hospital, it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would not be helpful, and that from a Cardiology perspective you would be safe for surgery.
Following discontinuation your kidney function is back at an elevated baseline.
Your blood pressure was significantly elevated when you were admitted to the hospital, and several changes were made to your BP medication regimen in order to bring it back down to a normal level.
The surgery was scheduled for Thursday [**2104-6-12**] but due to issues in the Operating Room inserting a nasogastric tube the surgery was cancelled and the ENT service performed an endoscopic examination to assess your anatomy for any abnormalities or injuries during the attempted nasogastric tube placement.
Call your Cardiologist for an appointment next week for a blood pressure check and medication adjustments  Call your Urologist at [**Hospital6 33**] for a follow up appointment in 1 month                                [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD [**MD Number(2) 601**]  Completed by:[**2104-6-21**
