Her BNP was found to be [**2120**] and her troponin was elevated at 1.07 which decreased to 0.68 yesterday.
Her CK yesterday was 63.
Echo at OSH showed EF of 40%, and ?
At OSH VS: SR/bigeminy HR 80-90's, afebrile RR 18, 100% on 2 liters,  OSH Labs: K 3.7, bun 22, creat 0.6, Mag 1.9, Hct 34.1, plt 270, INR 0.93 wbc 6.5    Past Medical History: Polymyositis on long term prednisone HTN CHF Diabetes - in OSH records, patient denies COPD Severe lymphedema and venous stasis S/p recent right above the knee amputation MI PVD Anxiety Hx of sepsis over the past year MRSA   Social History: Non-smoker, non-drinker, no drugs.
Physical Exam: VS - 98.8 108/49 8220 98% on RA patient more comfortable on 2Lnc  Gen: NAD obese female.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 8 cm though difficult to assess given body habitus.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ DP 2+   Pertinent Results: CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2129-11-17**]: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP 11 mmHg.
There was evidence of mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP 146 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.3 L/min/m2.
Resting ventriculogram revealed mild global hypokinesis with an EF of 45% and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CT C/A/P: A large hiatal hernia persists with a small left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
Non-contrast evaluation of the liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appears unremarkable.
Vicarious excretion of contrast is noted within the gallbladder, which otherwise appears unremarkable.

EKG with T wave inverisons throughout.
She was transfered here to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization which showed essentially clear coronaries.
Echo after cath showed no hypokinesis, EF 50%.
Following the cath, patient developed a cath site hematoma and subsequently became hypotensive to the 70's and had a hct drop from 27 to 21.
CT showed a right common femoral artery 5 x 2 cm hematoma, without evidence of active extravasation or interval expansion following delayed imaging.
On [**11-18**] her Hct dropped down to 21.1 (was originally in the low 30's) and she became hypotenisve to the 80's and she was transfered to the CCU for closer monitoring.
A repeat CT at that time showed no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or worsening of right groin hematoma.
She was transfused a total of 4 units PRBC with stabilization of her Hct at 30 for the 24 hours.
Her BP also remained stable following the transfusions.
CAD: Patient with history of prior MI, echo at OSH showing 40% EF (unknown prior), with hypokinesis in an unknown location.
Troponin at OSH elevated at peak of 1.07, CK 63.
Cardiac cath showed essentially clear coronary arteries.
Echo with EF of 50%.
Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: EF 50% on echo here.
BNP on OSH admission [**2120**], agressively diuresed there with good effect.
Lasix was discontinued as patient continued to have clinical signs of volume overload with crackles on lung exam in spite of IV lasix.
Transfered to CCU for closer monitoring where she received a total of 4 units pRBC with stabilization of her HCT and of her blood pressure.
You had a cardiac catheterization that showed no coronary artery disease.
