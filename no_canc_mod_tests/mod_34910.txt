DP/PT/radials   Pertinent Results: Cardiac Catheterization COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severe elevations in right and left sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 24 mmHg and a LVEDP of 29 mmHg.
There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 42/23 mmHg.
There was mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 158/76 mmHg.
The cardiac index was 1.8 L/min/m2.
ATTENDING STAFF: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] ECHO Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 16-22 mmHg).

Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal PA systolic pressure.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-2-27**], an aortic valve bioprosthesis is now present.

Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette relative to both the most recent prior and the pre-operative chest x-ray without evidence of CHF.
These findings could represent interval development of a pericardial effusion and a cardiac echo may be obtained for further characterization.
