/ Lipitor  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: headaches  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: arterial line [**2168-10-9**]   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]y F with history notable for bilateral SDH s/p evac here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2166**] as well as chronic, recurrent non-migrainous headaches, hypertension, and remote h/o migraine HA.
There, NCHCT was unremarakable (both the report and the images, which I reviewed at that time) and a carotid doppler U/S of the carotids study was reportedly without e/o stenosis.
We recommended f/u with her outpatient Neurologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has been following her since [**2166**]), and stopping the medication that may have triggered the HA (amlodipine) and follow up with her PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 2678**] to try a different anti-hypertensive [**Doctor Last Name 360**] because her BP was 170/x at that time (despite the amlodipine).
She followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] this past Monday ([**10-3**]), and he recommended trying verapamil extended-release 120mg daily for the BP and headaches in lieu of the amlodipine.
Here, her BP has ranged from 190s-250s systolic over 70s to 110s diastolic, and did not respond well to labetalol or hydralazine.
Low back pain, chronic - takes tramadol ("my favorite"), formerly experienced better relief with hydrocortisone.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Vital signs: T 98.6F HR 86, reg BP 196/119 --> 180-190 / 74 on my exam RR 24 --> teens on my exam SaO2 100%  General: Lying in ED stretcher in trauma bay, daughter sitting next to her.
2+ radial, DP pulses bilaterally.
V: Facial sensation intact and subjectively symmetric to light touch V1-V2-V3.
Joint position sense minimally impaired in both both great toes and subtly in RUE (missed nose initially; may have been [**2-10**] compression from BP cuff which I just deflated before test).
-Reflex examination (left; right): Biceps (++;++) Triceps  (++;++) Brachioradialis (++;++) Quadriceps / patellar (++;++) Gastroc-soleus / achilles (0;0) Plantar response was mute bilaterally.
-Coordination: Finger-nose-finger testing with no dysmetria or intention tremor, mild tremor.
-Gait: deferred, given the labile BP and pt preference ______________________________________________________________ Discharge Examination: No change from initial examination except for variable orientation: oriented to name and place but not month, year, or hospital name.

CXR [**2168-10-9**]: Heart size is normal.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 2127**] [**Known lastname 1968**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with PMHx of bilateral SDH/hygromas in [**2166**] s/p evacuation and resolution, DM, HTN, HL and hypothyroidism who presented with HA x2 weeks and hypertensive urgency, thought to be causing the headaches.
She refused BP checks with a cuff because they were "too painful".
Therefore, we kept her in the ICU to have her BP monitored with an A-line.
Her HR remained stable in the 70's after we increased her Toprol XL dose from 25->50mg QD.
Her HCT remained stable throughout this hospitalization.
We monitred her potassium and BUN/Cr, which remained increased after starting furosemide, likely also with a contribution of volume depletion.
We stopped her furosemide and will not restart this medication at this time.
# CODE/CONTACT: DNR/[**Name2 (NI) 835**] requested by pt; daughter [**Telephone/Fax (1) 99907**]  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: [ ] She will need her BP monitored and her BUN + Cr monitored to ensure that they stay within her baseline ranges.
[ ] Please recheck her electrolytes to monitor her potassium and creatinine.

While here we controlled your blood pressure, initially on intravenous medications, and then on oral medications.
Your blood pressure improved, and when this happened, your headaches also improved.
