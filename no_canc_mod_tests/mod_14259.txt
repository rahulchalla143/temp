TEE (Complete) Done [**2146-10-5**] at 4:19:52 PM      FINAL Conclusions No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
EEG Study Date of [**2146-10-4**] IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal routine EEG in the waking state secondary to a right hemispheric breach artifact.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 51933**] is a 62 yo M with history of schizophrenia, dementia, NMS, anxiety, cardiomyopathy, found on floor unresponsive and found to have brainstem hemorrhage involving R midbrain, bilateral pons, and 4th ventricle.
His blood pressure was maintained < 160 mmHG with nicardipine as needed.
His exam has remained relatively stable at day for the first 2 weeks of his hospitalization, with minimal evidence of awareness or interaction with his environment.
His hypertension improved and he was weaned from nicardipine.
His exam has remained relatively stable since that time, with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] levels of interaction in the setting of fever/infection.
Blood cultures ([**9-29**]) were noted to be positive for coagulase negative staph, and Vancomycin treatment was restarted.
The most recent cultures ([**10-6**]) continued to grow pseudamonas and Zosyn treatment was initiated.
# Cardiovascular/Hypertension: On admission, the patient was monitored on telemetry with no major events and nicardipine drip was used for SBP > 160.
He has continued to have adequate stool output on his current bowel regimen, but his abdomen should be monitored and medications increased accordingly.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Piperacillin-Tazobactam-Dextrs 4.5 gram/100 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1)  Intravenous Q8H (every 8 hours): For Pseudomonas pneumonia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: brainstem hemorrhage involving R midbrain, bilateral pons, and 4th ventricle, likely hypertensive etiology.
His neurolgic exam was notable for the following: Responds to voice and follows simple commands.
