An electrocardiogram was unremarkable for ischemia with the exception of new right bundle branch block.
Neurologic evaluation for autonomic seizures was obtained.
Infectious Disease was consulted for the persistent fevers on [**9-1**]; however, blood cultures were negative from [**2063-8-26**], and 25.
Urine culture were negative from [**8-26**] and [**8-31**].
Sputum cultures from [**9-1**] demonstrated 1+ gram-positive cocci which ended up growing sparse oropharyngeal organisms.
Previous sputum cultures from [**8-27**] and [**8-30**] also demonstrated rare oropharyngeal organisms.
There was a potential retrocardiac infiltrate on chest x-ray worrisome for pneumonia.
A transesophageal echocardiogram and abdominal CT were negative.
On [**9-9**], the patient was transferred to the floor to finish her course of antibiotics, and the patient was to have a permanent pacemaker placed upon negative blood cultures times 72 hours.
Vital signs: Temperature 96.3?????
?, blood pressure 116/70, heart rate 80, respirations 20, oxygen saturation 97% on 2 L nasal cannula.
Carotid pulses 2+ bilaterally.
No dullness to percussion anteriorly.
Posteriorly the patient had dullness to percussion on the left side, one-third up the lung field.
Pneumatic compression boots were in place.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Grasp strength was 5 out of 5 bilaterally.
Quadriceps reflex was 2+ bilaterally.
Finger-to-nose testing was clumsy.
LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer white blood cell count was 9.6, hematocrit 29.3, platelet count 383; sodium 133, potassium 3.9, chloride 96, bicarb 27, BUN 36, creatinine 1.3, glucose 169; PT 14.6, PTT 79.1, INR 1.5; albumin 1.9; Digoxin 1.5; calcium 7.7, magnesium 1.8, phosphate 4.9.
LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  WBC 6.3, hematocrit 34.0, platelet count 285; sodium 143, potassium 4.1, chloride 92, bicarb 39, BUN 42, creatinine 1.2, glucose 81, magnesium 1.9; PTT, PT, and INR were pending on the day of discharge, INR on the day prior to discharge was 3.4.
Lateral decubitus film on [**2145-9-16**], showed a moderate sized left pleural effusion with only partial layering was demonstrated.
A right clavicular x-ray on [**2145-9-17**], demonstrated mid and distal clavicular cortical thickening, coarsened trabeculae which would be consistent with Paget's disease.
Transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2145-9-3**], demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
She was evaluated with cycling of cardiac enzymes and electrocardiograms.
Pump:  The patient has left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55% on several echocardiogram performed while in the CCU.
The pleural fluid analysis demonstrated fluid that was consistent with transudative process with the likely etiology of congestive heart failure.
On discharge, the patient's room air oxygen saturation was 93%.
This was evaluated at rest, and the patient will continue to need supplemental oxygen and further evaluation for her requirement upon optimal diuresis.
Blood cultures were drawn at that time, and she demonstrated no growth from these cultures prior to the insertion of her permanent pacemaker.
Hematocrit upon discharge was 34.0.
The patient received several units of packed red blood cells to keep her hematocrit above 30.
Previous work-up of her anemia was consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Prior to discharge, she was started on Heparin with a goal PTT of 50-70.
She was then initiated on Coumadin therapy with a goal INR of [**1-10**].
Neurologic:  The patient's daughter noted that her Milk of Magnesia was "tired" and slow on [**2145-9-15**].
The feeling was that the patient was postprocedure and received sedation; however, a CT scan of the head was obtained.
The CT scan of the head was unremarkable for bleeding.
q.h.s., this will need to be titrated with constant monitoring of the PT/INR for the next two weeks (check INR three times a week), Ipratropium Bromide nebulizer 1 neb q.6 hours p.r.n., Albuterol nebulizer 1 neb treatment q.6 hours p.r.n., Peri-Colace 1 cap p.o.
p.r.n., Percocet [**12-9**] tab p.o.
p.r.n., Ativan 0.25-1.0 mg p.o./IV q.4-6 hours p.r.n.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14069**] within 1-2 weeks.
The patient will require a PT/INR, electrolytes, and hematocrit checks three times per week during the next two weeks; to be checked while the patient is at the [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation Facility.
