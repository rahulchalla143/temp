On arrival in the Emergency Department, blood pressure was 74/48 and his oxygen saturation was 67% on room air.
An arterial blood gases done on 100% non rebreather showed 7.26, 50, 69, with a lactate of 12.4.
He was initially started on Dopamine for his blood pressure and responded to Bi-Pap.
He was then transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Congestive heart failure, with an echo showing an ejection fraction of 20 to 25% and four chamber dilation as well as severe hypokinesis of the left ventricle and right ventricle.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission to [**Hospital1 1444**], physical examination revealed the following:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of 96.3; blood pressure 108/64; pulse 86; respiratory rate 17; oxygen saturation 96% on Bi-Pap 10/5 at 100% oxygen.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and white count 11.8; hematocrit of 35.5; platelets 182; 81 neutrophils, 2 bands, 6 lymphs, 1 mono.
INR 2.5.
Sodium of 141; potassium of 5.7; chloride 92; bicarbonate 15; BUN 60; creatinine 2.6; glucose 150.
Anion gap of 37.
Calcium 9.1; phosphorus 7.0; magnesium 2.5; lactate 12.4.
Arterial blood gases 7.26, 50, 69 on 100% non rebreather.
However, his hypotension self-resolved and the pressors were able to be weaned without any further intervention.
It was thought at the time that his low blood pressures may have been secondary to multiple pulmonary embolisms.
He had no further episodes of hypotension throughout the remainder of his hospitalization, after coming out of the unit.
His creatinine after coming to the floor was 1.2.
However, his wife and the patient himself refused cardiac catheterization as well as heparin.
The patient has known systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25% and global ventricular dilation as well as aspects of hypokinesis and akinesis.
They refused a Foley to monitor his urine output even though he was incontinent.
During the end of his hospitalization, with worsening congestive heart failure, as shown both clinically and on physical examination, as well as on chest x-ray, his wife agreed to have occasional doses of intravenous Lasix, to which he responded with increased urine output per the nurses but clinically as still short of breath.
Over the course of his hospitalization, he required increasing amounts of oxygen to keep his oxygen saturations near 88-90%.
During the last week of his hospitalization, he required 15 liters non rebreather with his oxygen saturation running anywhere between the mid 70's to 90%.
According to his wife, he only needed it when his sugars were greatly over 200.
Disposition:  The patient was difficult to treat, secondary to his constant deferral of medical decisions to his wife, who would refuse many of the treatments that were offered, including blood draws, chest radiography, and medications.
