Unclear etiology, very rapid rise in Cr on the floor post elective hernia repair, sodium avid by urine lytes (Na <10, FUrea 4%) suggesting severe prerenal state.
Initally UA at the time of transfer to CCU showed evidence of UTI, we started him on Cipro, but subsequent UA and urine Cx (no growth to date) not suggestive of UTI, so Cipro was d/c'ed.
