Her blood pressures increased to 128/87 upon second measurement without any intervention being made.
Her finger stick was critically high and her blood glucose returned at 588.
Upon repeat testing 3 hours later, her blood glucose had increased to 672 and she was given another 10 units of regular insulin.
It was then decided to start her on an insulin drip to better control her sugars despite no anion gap being present.
A UA showed moderate leukocyte esterase positivity and 15 WBCs.
Blood cultures and a urine culture was sent.
CXR reportedly did not show any acute process.
An EKG reportedly showed NSR at a rate of 82 with T-wave flattening in lead III which was consistent with prior EKGs.
Of note, the patient developed a pink rash all over her body which was most notable on her palms, shins, chest, and back before she received the vancomycin and it was thought that the rash was due to hyperemia from re-perfusion after initially being mottled.
She was also bolused with 3 Liters of NS with a 4th Liter hanging upon transfer and her lactate decreased from 2.8 to 2.2.
Transfer vitals were T=100.8, HR=88, BP=112/52, RR=16, POx=100% RA.
She admits to being confused and reports seeing [**Doctor Last Name **] hair pasta on the walls and believes she heard that [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] has killed little children on TV.
