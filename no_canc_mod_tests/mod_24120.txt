A CXR showed patchy b/l infiltrate c/f multifocal PNA vs septic emboli.
Levofloxacin was given here along with 2L IVF with improvement in BP to the low 100s systolic.
CXR again showed mostly right sided infiltrates.

CT Chest with IV contrast [**2103-6-25**]: Multiple bilateral cavitary and non-cavitary areas of consolidation are noted to vary in size and number.
Although this examination was not intended for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the partially imaged abdomen shows wedge-shaped hypoattenuation of the spleen, consistent with a splenic infarction.
Splenic infarct in upper abdomen is likely due to same process.
TTE [**2103-6-26**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
CT Abdomen without IV contrast [**2103-6-28**]: Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate in the visualized lung bases, with passive bibasilar atelectasis.
Persistent hypodensity in the posterior aspect of the spleen, which wedge-shaped morphology most likely represent ongoing evolution of splenic infarct that was previously noted in the chest CT three days ago.
Evaluation of intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy is limited, but there are several small celiac lymph nodes.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is normally distended without focal abnormality.
Limited evaluation of the appendix reviews no gross abnormality (image 2:66).
Evaluation of lymphadenopathy is limited without IV contrast.
LABS PENDING AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER: HepBcAb, Daily Blood Cultures from [**6-24**] - [**6-29**].
# Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis: Endocarditis was initially suspected after chest x-ray suggested multifocal pneumonia and blood cultures grew staph aureus.
Of note, CT of the chest and abdomen showed a splenic infarct that may have been caused by a septic embolus.
Bubble echo did not show a PFO to suggest paradoxical embolism.
No imaging was performed as he did not have any seizures during the hospitalization and no neurologic abnormalities were detected.
CT abdomen without contrast on [**6-28**] did not show any evidence of fluid collections.
His respirations were still rapid, ranging from 26-32.
This pain has been well controlled with oxycodone 10mg Q4h, acetaminophen 1000mg q6h, and ibuprofen 400mg Q8h.
Hepatitis C: When the patient presented he had a platelet count of 65, and given his history of IV drug use he was tested for Hepatitis C. Viral load was 1,270,000.
# Thrombocytopenia: He had an admission PLT of 65, however this quickly normalized and his platelets were prior to discharge.
Urine drug screen at the OSH showed cocaine however the patient denies using cocaine.
# Labs pending at the time of transfer: HepBcAb, Daily Blood Cultures from [**6-24**] - [**6-29**].
