Cardiac Cath [**2110-10-4**]: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal LVEDP of 11 mmHg and normal systolic arterial pressure.
EKG [**2110-10-5**]: Sinus rhythm and significant Q waves in leads II, III and aVF and continued ST segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF and V5-V6 with now biphasic T waves in leads III and aVF.
Cardiac Cath [**2110-10-6**]: Findings ESTIMATED blood loss: <100 cc Hemodynamics (see above): Coronary angiography:  right dominant LMCA:  No angiographically apparent CAD LAD:  mid vessel in-stent restenosis and disease between prior stents 80% LCX:  Mild luminal irregularities RCA:  Not injected  Interventional details Change for 6 French XB3.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis.
ECHO [**2110-10-7**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-7-18**], the findings are similar.
