Admission Date:  [**2159-3-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-4-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-5-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cerebral Angiogram [**2159-3-20**] Cerebral angiogram [**2159-3-26**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 48 year old white male who was transferred from an OSH for SAH.
No pronator drift  sensation grossly intact  On Discharge NON FOCAL  Pertinent Results: CTA head [**3-19**]: prelim CT Head: SAH in the left Sylvian fissure, along the anterior falx, perimesencephalic and premedullary cisterns with effacement of sulci in left cerebral convexity.
Cerebral Angiogram [**3-19**]: FINDINGS: Right vertebral artery arteriogram shows fairly large caliber right vertebral artery with normal filling of the right PICA.
Left external carotid artery arteriogram shows no evidence of dural AV fistula or AVMs.
Left vertebral artery arteriogram shows normal filling of the left vertebral artery.
CT BRAIN PERFUSION Study Date of [**2159-3-28**] 11:30 AM  Final Report HISTORY: 48-year-old male with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
COMPARISON: CT perfusion, [**2159-3-23**] and cerebral angiograms, [**2159-3-26**] and [**2159-3-19**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast imaging was performed from the foramen magnum to the cranial vertex.
Following the uneventful administration of IV contrast, CTA was performed through the head, and CT perfusion was also performed.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: As expected, there has been progressive decrease in the conspicuity and quantity of subarachnoid hemorrhage, with small foci of persistent blood products seen interdigitating in the sulci in the left frontoparietal region (2:21).
This is new since the CT perfusion study [**2159-3-23**], and increased since the cerebral angiogram of [**2159-3-26**] which demonstrated slight irregularity of the basilar artery, but essentially normal caliber at that time.
CT PERFUSION: There is no regional abnormality of mean transit time or cerebral blood flow, and the cerebral blood volume appears symmetric.
CT PERFUSION: CT perfusion demonstrates no territorial areas of abnormal perfusion.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD: CT angiography of the head again demonstrates diminished caliber of the basilar artery compared to the examination of [**2159-3-19**].
However, this has not significantly changed since the examination of [**2159-3-28**].
Head CT shows slight prominence of ventricles with a small amount of blood in the ventricles.
CT perfusion of the head demonstrates no evidence of asymmetric perfusion or large territorial area of perfusion abnormality.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates vasospasm involving the basilar artery which is unchanged from [**2159-3-28**] but new since [**2159-3-19**].
MRA brain, cspine, tspine was ordered to rule out AVM.
He will continue to be observed in the ICU for a week, then will have a repeat angiogram to rule out aneurysm.
He had a repeat angiogram on [**2159-3-26**] which was negative for aneurysm.
CTA showed vasospam of basilar and bilateral PCAs.
Exam remained stable through [**3-30**], and on [**3-31**], he was transferred out of the ICU to the floor.
His blood pressure parameters were liberalized to 160, and his fluids were brought down to 100cc/hour.
[**Date range (1) 25246**] he remained stable but continued to report headaches.
