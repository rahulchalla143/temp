CXR [**7-7**]: IMPRESSION: Significant worsening of the multifocal airspace opacities throughout the lungs with relative sparing of the apices is likely related to multifocal infection.
CT chest [**7-8**]: No pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 45 year old male with history of hypertension who presents after a couple weeks of malaise and acute onset of fevers, chills, and shortness of breath over 3 days with newly diagnosed HIV on [**7-8**] and worsening PNA seen on CT suggestive of PCP.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Patient with fevers, chills, nonproductive cough and CXR with left mid and upper lung field PNA.
His PORT score was 80 on admission and he has maintained a normal WBC count with a left shift throughout his hospital course.
Sexually active with men, HIV test negative 2 years ago and reports sex with condoms.
HIV antibody positive, viral load 61,600 copies on [**7-8**].
He was started empirically on [**Month/Day (4) **] (day 1 [**7-5**]) for a community acquired pneumonia; however, his oxygen requirement escalated [**7-7**] from 3 to 5 Liters to maintain his oxygen saturation in the low 90s.
Sputum induced on [**7-8**] was positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii), yeast, and normal oropharygeal flora and negative for Legionella.
Urine legionella was negative.
CT scan obtained on [**7-9**] showed diffuse ground glass opacities consistent with PCP.
Further work-up revealed a negative RPR and past exposure/current immunity to HBV and HAV.
However, sputum cultures from [**7-11**], [**7-12**], and [**7-15**] only grew sparse oropharyngeal flora and yeast.
Given persistent ARDS physiology and inability to wean him from vent, CT was performed on [**7-18**], which revealed new left lower lobe opacity not seen at admission.
However, sputum sample on [**7-18**] grew just few yeast, and mini-BAL on [**7-19**] grew only 10-100,000 yeast, with a negative viral culture.
CXR and clinical picture began to stablize/improve by [**7-27**].
An associated BAL revealed >100,000 yeast but no other microorganisms, although he had already received multiple abx doses by the time of the BAL.
CXR on [**8-5**] slight improvement in the atelectasis/airspace opacities in the LLL and with stable multifocal airspace opacities in the remaining lungs.
Sputum cultures from [**8-3**] grew sparse oropharyngeal flora, and cx from [**8-5**] was pending.
Given that the CXR opacities could also represent pulmonary edema, an echo was ordered for [**8-5**].
His anxiety was managed with Diazepam 7mg qHS/5mg q12hrs PRN, Fluoxetine 10mg daily, Seroquel 75mg qHS/25mg qHS PRN.
- Continue Diazepam 7mg qHS/5mg q12hrs PRN, Fluoxetine 10mg daily, Seroquel 75mg qHS/25mg qHS PRN .
# FEVER/TACHYCARDIA/LEUKOCYTOSIS: T102, HR 124, WBC 12.4 (WBC 21 on [**7-11**])meeting SIRS criteria on [**7-12**], as per above.
His abx coverage was decreased to just vancomycin after blood culture from [**7-12**] grew out 1 bottle of coag negative staph, but vanco was discontinued on [**7-18**] due to the low suspicion for CoNSA bacteremia in stable clinical setting.
WBC were within normal limits by [**7-15**], but he continued to spike intermittent fevers, including up to 104 on [**7-24**] resulting in extraction of PICC line, all associated with negative blood cultures.
Spike to T 101 on [**8-3**] prompted blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, and C. difficile (UCx negative, all others pending.)
CXR from [**8-5**] showed stable to improving parenchymal opacities.
Abdominal CT was also performed on [**8-5**] given elevated liver and pancreatic enzymes, and prelim read showed no acute abdominal processes.
Blood cultures were negative from [**2118-7-5**], [**7-15**], [**7-16**], [**7-17**], [**7-21**], [**7-24**], 8/17,[**7-30**] with BCx from [**8-3**] and [**8-5**] pending.
Blood culture for fungus and AFB were negative on [**7-21**].
Urine cultures performed with temp spikes were persistently negative, last on [**8-3**].
Stool samples have been consistently negative for C. difficile (last negative on [**9-16**] pending); microsporidium, cryptosporidium, giardia (last on [**7-23**]); salmonella, shigella, campylobacter (last on [**7-31**]).
Stool was negative for ova and parasites on [**7-23**] and for enteric gram negative rods on [**7-31**].
Cultures for extracted catheters were negative on [**7-24**] and [**7-29**].
Upon call out to the floor from the MICU, patient's foley was discontinued and urinalysis showed no signs of urinary tract infection.
# BP LABILITY: His outpatient regimen of Lisinopril and HCTZ were held due to the development of hypotension in the setting of SIRS by [**7-12**].
Head CT on [**7-25**] showed no acute intracranial process associated with his HTN.
Attempts to wean sedation resulted in intermittent spikes in BP and HR, which were somewhat improved after trach placement.
His blood pressure was subsequently maintained on Clonidine patch, started [**8-3**], and IVF boluses as needed for intermittent hypotension in the setting of extensive autodiuresis.
By the time patient was called out of the MICU, his blood pressure was stable on Clonidine patch.
On [**7-21**], his peripheral smear was notable for metamyelocytes typical of HIV, and hematology recommended that there was no need for bone marrow biopsy given these results.
On [**8-2**], his Hct dropped acutely from 22 to 19.7.
There were no signs of acute blood loss or end-organ failure or hemolysis (LDH and total bilirubin were within normal limits).
His Hct was 25.8 on [**2196-8-15**], which was stable since his call out from MICU.
Tylenol levels negative at admission.
Hep serologies show past exposure and current immunity to HBV and HAV.
PCR for CMV was negative on [**7-10**].
Transaminases peaked at ALT 108, AST 106, and alkaline phosphatase 267 on [**7-29**].
Liver and gallbladder ultrasound showed no focal liver abnormalities and a normal gallbladder on [**7-11**] but gallbladder wall irregularity at the level of the fundus, potentially respresenting HIV cholangiopathy, was noted on [**7-22**].
CT on [**7-18**] and [**7-25**] identified a small amount of sludge vs. small stones in the gallbladder, but by [**7-27**], there continued to be no convincing ultrasound evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary ductal dilatation.
Given elevated lipase, an abdominal CT was performed on [**8-5**] was (prelim read) negative as per above.
# ELEVATED LIPASE: Lipase was within normal limits at the time of admission but peaked at 389 on [**7-30**] following propofol use in the setting of extubation.
CT of the abdomen on [**7-18**] and [**7-25**] failed to appreciated pancreatitis.
To assess fevers and elevated lipase, an abdominal CT was performed on [**8-5**], which was (prelim read) negative, as per above.
Lipase levels were not checked.
Urine sodium noted on wasting with Na 163 on [**7-25**] during autodiuresis.
FeNA last 1.4 on [**8-4**], with associated UNa 169 and UOsm 485.
Creatinine WNL, good UOP.
Patient was continued on Diazepam 7mg qHS/5mg q12hrs PRN, Fluoxetine 10mg daily, Seroquel 75mg qHS/25mg qHS PRN while on the floor.
Tube feeds were resumed [**7-20**] but TF material was found coming from his mouth the same day, and NG suction revealed 450 cc residuals.
Imaging revealed that the Dobhoff was not post-pyloric and lipase increased, so TPN was started on [**7-23**] ending tube advancement.
Speech and Swallow evaluation on [**2196-8-16**] cleared patient for Thin Liquids, Regular Solids with re-evaluation by nutrition and speech/swallow as outpatient when patient can be weaned off his G-tube.
Glycemic control was discontinued due to glucose levels consistently <150.
