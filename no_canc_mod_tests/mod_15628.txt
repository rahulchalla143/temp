She was the unrestrained driver of the vehicle and was found at the scene with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Scale of 3.
She had a hypotensive episode of a systolic blood pressure down to 80 requiring four liters of Crystalloid and one unit of packed red blood cells.
A computer tomography scan of the head was performed at the outside hospital which demonstrated pneumocephalus with intracranial hemorrhage and occipital condyle fracture.
A computer tomography scan of the chest was also performed which showed no evidence of mediastinal pathology or pneumothorax.
A computer tomography scan of the pelvis had a small amount of left perinephric fluid collection and question of a small area of free air at the dome of the liver without evidence of splenic or hepatic injury.
Upon arrival in the Trauma Bay, her vital signs were temperature of 98.4 F.; heart rate of 84; blood pressure 110/palpable; saturation of 100%.
Her neurological examination was [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of 3P.
Her Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose and Throat examination was significant for equal and reactive pupils 3 to 2 millimeters bilaterally.
She had a scalp laceration; no facial lacerations.
Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence of crepitants.
Her cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm.
Her laboratory values on initial examination were a white blood cell count of 19, a hematocrit of 34 with platelet count of 299.
Her coagulation studies were an INR of 1.1 with a PTT of 21.3.
Her Chemistries demonstrated a potassium of 3.3, a BUN of 8, and a creatinine of 0.6 with a glucose of 154.
Her amylase was 62.
Her arterial blood gas upon arrival demonstrated a pH of 7.35, pCO2 of 34, pO2 of 108, bicarbonate of 20 and a base excess of minus five.
A CT scan of her head was obtained after a ventriculostomy drain had been placed and that demonstrated the following: Acute thalamic parenchymal hemorrhage on the right with mass effect and a leftward trans-falcine herniation as well as diffuse areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage in multiple sulci of both cerebral hemispheres and along the tentorium.
She had a DPL also performed in the Trauma Bay to rule out hollow viscus injury secondary to blunt force trauma.
She was admitted for intracranial pressure monitoring with ventriculostomy and treatment of this intracranial hypertension with Mannitol and sedation to maximize her cerebral perfusion pressure and minimize her ICP.
A pulmonary artery catheter was to be placed if close monitoring of her volume status would be required.
Given the fact that she had potential pulmonary contusions and a lung injury, she was to be kept with plateau pressures less than 30 on light protective ventilation.
From a Genitourinary standpoint, we were to monitor her urine output; her hematocrit was stable and to be kept greater than 30 to maximize the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood.
Fluids, Electrolytes were to be maintained.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Prior to transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a CT scan of the cervical spine which demonstrated a fracture through the right transverse process, inferior facet and right lamina of C7 with extensive skull base fractures.
On SICU day number two, her neurological examination was significant for what appeared to be decorticate posturing to painful stimulus.
A pulmonary artery catheter was placed and, on SICU day number three, the patient was placed in a Pentobarbital coma after sedation paralysis and Mannitol failed to control her intracranial pressures, which were intermittently up to 30 with compromised cerebral perfusion pressures.
She was continued on Mannitol and she was also started on Norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure such that her cerebral perfusion pressures would be greater than 70 in the face of elevated intracranial pressures.
An EEG was obtained to confirm burst suppression with the Pentobarb coma.
She was transfused packed red blood cells to maintain her hematocrit greater than 30.
She was continued on the Pentobarb coma for 24 hours but because her intracranial pressures remained elevated up to 40 to 50 despite burst suppression and a pentobarbital coma and continued therapy with Mannitol as well as vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressures, the pentobarbital was stopped.
A Xenon brain scan was obtained on SICU day number five, which was [**4-29**], and demonstrated normal flow to the brain despite this intractable intracranial hypertension.
Pentobarb levels were checked on a daily basis to allow us to make decisions about her neurological status.
We continued to support her both from a ventilatory and nutritional standpoint and by SICU day number eight, although she still had significant pentobarb on board, she was breathing spontaneously and her ICPs began to drift down wards to persistently below 20.
She also began to maintain her mean arterial pressures in the 100 range off of any vasopressors.
Her pentobarb levels came down to within normal range and a neurological examination at that point performed with the Neurosurgeons demonstrated that she opened her eyes to noxious stimuli and had a flexion response of all four extremities to noxious stimuli without crossing of the midline.
At this time, she had thoracic and lumbar spine films which demonstrated no evidence of fracture or dislocation of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Transcranial Dopplers were performed and demonstrated approximately eight embolic events per 15 minute period.
At this point, an MRI of her brain was obtained and the MRI demonstrated a moderate sized right thalamic hemorrhage with minimal mass effect and leftward shift of the normal midline structures, multiple bilateral tiny foci of susceptibility artifacts that suggest multiple small shear injuries and slight increased T2 signal within the pons of unclear etiology with flow present in all the major branches of the cerebral circulation.
Her current examination is that she opens her eyes to noxious stimulus.
From a hematologic standpoint, she has a hematocrit that has been stable in the 30s on Epogen.
