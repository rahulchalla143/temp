At that hospital, the patient underwent a colonoscopy which disclosed edema, redness, and necrotic mucosa in the sigmoid colon.
A noncontrast computed tomography showed nonspecific colonic thickening.
Her white blood cell count began to normalize, but within two days she complained of increased abdominal pain and spiked a temperature on [**1-8**].
Of note, [**6-8**] blood cultures were growing a yeast.
Following her stroke, the patient sustained a hypoxic brain injury.
Coronary artery disease; the patient noted to have anterior wall ischemia on a stress test done in [**2195-1-2**].
Her ejection fraction was 66%.
Vital signs revealed temperature was 104, heart rate was 140, blood pressure was 211/76, respiratory rate was 40, SaO2 was 96% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to light.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Rectal examination revealed stool guaiac-positive.
Neurologic examination was difficult to assess secondary to agitation.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data revealed white blood cell count was 23.8, hematocrit was 28.6, and platelets were 286.
Sodium was 134, potassium was 3.9, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen was 55, creatinine was 2.9, and blood glucose was 327.
Calcium was 7.9, magnesium was 1.3, phosphate was 2.6.
Prothrombin time was 20.7, partial thromboplastin time was 35.1, and INR was 2.8.
Fibrinogen was 657.
ALT was 15, AST was 15, total bilirubin was 0.3, albumin was 2.6, alkaline phosphatase was 93, and amylase was 40.
Microbiology data revealed 7/9 bottles from the outside hospital growing fungi.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 140 beats per minute.
A chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, a right Port-A-Cath in the subclavian vein, left tunnel dialysis catheter in internal jugular.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  On admission, the patient was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 36.
A bronchoscopy on [**1-18**] disclosed mild vocal cord edema.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  As noted above, [**6-8**] cultures from the outside hospital grew yeast.
Blood cultures from [**1-9**] and [**1-10**] done at this hospital grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
Due to persistent fevers, and an abdominal computed tomography was done on [**1-14**].
A transesophageal echocardiogram was done, and there was no evidence of vegetations.
The patient's blood cultures never grew an organism.
Over the course of her hospital stay, the patient defervesced and her white blood cell count decreased.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  On admission, the patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled.
She was noted to have an evaluated troponin of 5.9.
Her creatine kinase was 207 and MB was 6.
Her troponin trended down over the next few hours.
The elevation was attributed to a troponin leak due to demand ischemia, since the patient was tachycardic.
As noted above, a transthoracic echocardiogram done on admission did not disclose evidence of vegetations.
The transesophageal echocardiogram done on [**1-15**] also showed no evidence of valvular vegetations.
Cardiac output was 7 and systemic vascular resistance was 640; consistent with a septic picture.
The patient's blood pressure remained high during her hospital stay.
Her blood pressure has been treated with increasing doses of Lopressor and hydralazine as well as amlodipine.
A computed tomography of the abdomen done on [**1-9**] disclosed thickening of the colonic wall.
Three stool samples were sent to the laboratory during her hospitalization, and all were negative for Clostridium difficile.
A 24-hour urine collection was done which disclosed a creatinine clearance of 18.
The patient has maintained good urine output and responded well to Lasix.
Her creatinine has been stable.
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient was maintained on an insulin drip for maintenance of blood sugars of less than 120.
OPHTHALMOLOGIC ISSUES:  An ophthalmologic evaluation was done to rule out endophthalmitis.
