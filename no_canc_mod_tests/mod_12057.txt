The patient underwent cardiac catheterization at an outside hospital on [**2104-1-3**], which revealed left main coronary artery disease as well significant three vessel disease.
Pulse 71.
Blood pressure 179/76.
Respiratory rate 18.
Oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters per minute nasal cannula.
His coronary examination was S1 and S2 with a grade 1/6 systolic ejection murmur.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  Revealed a hematocrit 39%, potassium 4.9, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8.
Cardiac catheterization revealed a normal ejection fraction with left main and three vessel coronary artery disease.
The patient had lactate acidosis with a serum lactate in the 4 to 7 range.
The sputum initially grew out gram negative rods, which turned out to be Moraxella, which was resistant to Ampicillin Penicillin.
Postoperative day five the patient underwent echocardiogram, which revealed significant left ventricular hypokinesis as well as tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation.
The patient's chest x-ray over the next couple of days was consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome, which would correlate with this increased oxygen requirement as well as the need for increased PEEP.
The patient was continued to be tube fed at that time and the patient had also become febrile with a white blood cell count in the 20,000 range.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy on the [**2104-1-14**], which revealed clear watery secretions and no purulent drainage.
The patient received intermittent blood transfusion with the hope to get him off the pressors to help with blood pressure support.
Abdominal CT scan was essentially negative.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2104-2-2**] due to worsening respiratory status and increasing need for ventilator support, which he had previously been weaned a little bit in his support.
He was continuing to be treated with Levofloxacin and Vancomycin for MRSA in his sputum as well as gram negative for the sputum, which was previously identified at Moraxella.
He was placed on Levophed for blood pressure support and was able to have that weaned somewhat and ultimately was on 0.5 mics per kilo per minute.
He was also intermittently transfused packed red blood cells to help with his blood pressure support.
The family has indicated that it was their wish to have the patient moved to a facility closer to home, since he still remained dependent on vasopressors for blood pressure support, we were unable to have him transferred to a long term chronic ventilator facility or an acute rehabilitation facility with ventilator support and this required his remaining in the Intensive Care Unit.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature 98.7.
Heart rate 89 in atrial fibrillation.
Blood pressure 126/47.
Oxygen saturation is 100%.
The patient remains on the ventilator, SIMV, FIO2 50%, tidal volume is 500, respiratory rate is 20.
His PEEP is 7.5 and his pressure support is 5.
Most recent arterial blood gases 7.36, PCO2 36, PO2 90, bicarb 21, base excess 94.
Most laboratory values revealed a white blood cell count 13.9000, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 124,000, sodium 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 108, CO2 20, BUN 68, creatinine 1.1, glucose 128, calcium 1.2, magnesium 1.8, phosphate 4.9.
Most recent cultures from [**1-29**], coag negative staph in the blood.
Cardiac examination was irregular rate and rhythm.
through the ventilator circuit, Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers q 2 hours via ventilator circuit around the clock, Lasix 40 mg intravenous b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg through the G tube q.d., sliding scale regular insulin coverage for blood sugar of 130 to 160 equals 2 units, 161 to 200 equals 4 units, 201 to 250 equals 6 units, 251 to 300 equals 8 units, 301 to 350 equals 10 units and 351 to 400 equals 12 units, subcutaneously greater then 400 to resume on insulin drip.
He has been receiving varying doses of Coumadin to keep him on the low therapeutic side with an INR to 1.5 to 2.0.
