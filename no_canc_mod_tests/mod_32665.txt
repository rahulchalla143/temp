Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 48-year-old woman with a history of migraine headaches, hypertension, cervical and lumbar spondylosis, and depression who presented with headache.
Prior to admission, she had had a CT that showed small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A cerebral angiogram revealed no aneurysm, but concern for  foci of stenosis in both posterior cerebral arteries and their branches that could be related to vasculitis or focal spasm.
Her TCD on the day of discharge showed markedly improved velocities, suggesting improvement of her vasospasm.
Her headache persisted, although improved to the point that she was able to perform banking and other routine online chores from her hospital bed.
