A CTA of the chest was negative for PE, but had bilateral pleural effusions.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Of note, she was intubated during an MRI on [**10-29**].
Her SBP has been maintained in the 100-110s today.
An ultrasound revealed cirrhotic liver.
A paracentesis removed 2 L. Blood, urine, peritoneal cultures cxs are pending.
Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: [**2125-10-29**] WBC 16.6 / hct 33.3 / Plt 491 Na 144 / K 3.9 / Cl 109 / CO2 22 / BUN 26 / Cr 1.3 / BG 220 BNP [**Numeric Identifier 40151**]  DISCHARGE LABS: [**2125-11-4**] WBC 10.9 / Hct 27.1 / Plt 540 Na 143 / K 3.3 / Cl 111 / CO2 26 / BUN 17 / Cr 1.2 / BG 103  MICROBIOLOGY: [**2125-10-29**] Blood Cx negative [**2125-10-29**] Urine Cx yeast [**2125-10-30**] Urine Cx yeast [**2125-10-30**] Peritoneal Fluid Culture - negative [**2125-10-31**] Urine Cx yeast  STUDIES: ECHO ([**2125-10-29**])- The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-10-25**], basal septal and anterior function are improved, but apical dysfunction is now identified.
This lesion may be better evaluated with multiphasic CT or an MRI of the abdomen if clinically indicated  [**2125-10-29**] MRI L spine 1.
CT of this region may be helpful to better assess the surgical hardware and any enhancement.
[**2125-11-1**] CXR - Left lower lobe sizable atelectasis and pleural effusion.
ECHO ([**2125-11-5**])- The left atrium is elongated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-10-29**], left ventricular systolic dyfunction is more extensive and suggests multivessel CAD (or myocarditis).
She was found to have a left sided pleural effusion on chest x-ray and was on 2L NC (satting 97% on discharge).
We checked room air sats also and patient was satting 96% on RA.
Given stable condition and good saturation on room air, we did not pursue a thoracentesis.
Cultures did not grow anything so Zosyn was discontinued shortly thereafter.
She remained afebrile and her WBC trended down (was 10.9 on discharge- down from 16.6 on admission).
Acute Kidney Injury- Patient presented with creatinine of 1.7 and stopped responding to diuresis in the CCU.
She demonstrated signs of fluid overload on exam (3+ LLE pitting edema, elevated JVP) but labs represented more of a pre-renal etiology (urine sodium < 10, hypernatremia, elevated creatinine).
Her creatinine improved daily.
Creatinine was 1.2 on discharge.
Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure- Patient had ECHO on admission given concern for cardiogenic shock.
During previous admission, ECHO showed EF of 35-40% with new anterior and anteroseptal left ventricular systolic dysfunction with subtle inferior wall hypokinesis.
ECHO on this visit showed improved EF of 45% and basal septal and anterior function.
Repeat ECHO on [**11-5**] revealed "moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior wall and the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls, and the apex.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-10-29**], left ventricular systolic dyfunction is more extensive and suggests multivessel CAD (or myocarditis).
Cirrhosis- An ultrasound on [**10-29**] revealed cirrhotic liver with no portal vein thrombosis.
Blood, urine, peritoneal cultures did not show any SBP or signs of active infection.
Speech and swallow recommended a video study after which she was advanced to a ground and pureed (dysphagia) diet with supervision.
In addition, we ask that the patient gets a colonoscopy as an outpatient  12.
Hematocrit near baseline.
Hematocrit remained stable while here.
Your oxygen requirement decreased, blood pressures normalized and kidney function improved.
Please start taking pantoprazole 40mg by mouth daily  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
