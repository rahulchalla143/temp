History of Present Illness: Pt is a 82y/o F with PMH of CAD s/p two MIs in [**2125**], cardiac cath in [**1-/2154**], and stroke presenting with L-sided chest and axillary tightness, diaphoresis and right leg cramping for 1.5 hours.
Chest tightness was non-radiating, located mid-sternal and left axillary.
CXR demonstrated mild pulmonary edema.
D-dimer elevated at 1277 so CTA was performed which showed no PE, dissection or PNA.
Patient received aspirin and was admitted for further evaluation and management.
Past Medical History: # CAD - hx of MI x 2 (Shore [**Hospital 107**] Hospital in NJ), Cardiac cath in [**1-/2154**] (moderate disease in the distal left main and mid RCA with mild disease in the LAD and LCX.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.

Chemical stress/perfusion test (Persantine-MIBI) [**2154-9-24**] .
Stress: INTERPRETATION: 82 yo woman (h/o MI x 2; cardiac catheterization revealing moderate LM and RCA disease and mild LAD and LCx disease without intervention) was referred to evaluate an atypical chest discomfort.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a large area of moderate to severe and fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior and inferseptal walls and a large area of moderate to severe and fixed perfusion defect in the proximal and mid anterior and ateroseptal walls.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 34%.
Cardiac catherization [**2154-9-25**] COMMENTS: 1.
The LMCA tapered distally to a 60% stenosis, which by IVUS had a cross sectional area of 4.9 mm2.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided filling pressures, with a LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed hypokinesis of the anterior, apical and inferior walls, with a depressed ejection fraction of 45-50%.
Carotid U/S [**2154-9-26**] IMPRESSION: Less than 40% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Echo [**2154-9-27**] PRE CPB Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
The anterior, anterlateral, and lateral walls display low normal function.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %).
Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged when compared with preoperative film, and maybe slightly smaller.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2154-9-23**] for further management of her chest tightness.
As she complained of shortness of breath and leg pain, a CTA was performed which showed no pulmonary embolism.
An ultrasound of her right leg was negative for a deep vein thrombosis.
The CT scan did reveal and incidental finding of an air-fluid level in esophagus.
A proton pump inhibitor was continued and follow-up was recommended to for evaluation for possible esophageal dysmotility.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a Persantine-MIBI stress test which showed large areas of mod to severe perfusion defects in inferior, anterior and septal walls.
Given the evidence of large defects and her significant cardiac history, a cardiac catheterization was performed.
A carotid duplex ultrasound showed no significant carotid artery disease.
A biopsy was obtained from her left ventricle given the atypical (possible amyloid)appearance of her heart.
Due to profound swelling, her chest was left open and she was brought to the intensive care unit in critical condition.
She was resuscitated per ACLS protocol and maintained a blood pressure for 20 minutes.
