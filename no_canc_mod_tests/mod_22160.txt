Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system with severe single-vessel coronary disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics performed after angiography and intervention revealed normal right- and mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 5 mmHg, mean PCW 19 mmHg).
The cardiac index was normal at 2.5 L/min/m2.
Left ventriculography was deferred due to contrast load during PCI.

Echo ([**7-11**]): 1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressedl (LVEF 30-35%).

1) Anterior STEMI: Mr.B presented with persistent ST elevations after thrombolysis; his peak CK was 4651 and MB>500.
Cath revealed one vessel coronary artery disease and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
He was kept on a heparin drip for 48 hrs post-cath with goal PTT 50-70.
Serial EKGs showed no signnificant change and cardiac enzymes trended down, so he was transferred back to the floor [**7-12**].
Post-MI echo showed a mildly dilated LA, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with LVEF of 30-35%.
Because these wall motion abnormalities put him at risk for thrombus formation, he was started on coumadin 5mg QD with a goal INR of [**12-28**].
He is to follow-up with his PCP on the [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**] after discharge to check his INR and adjust coumadin dosing as needed.
This testing will be done on an outpatient basis, approximately one month after discharge.
Lipitor 80 mg daily was started and BP was well controlled on metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] and lisinopril 2.5mg daily.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor and return to the hospital for any chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, palpitations, or any other questions/concerns you may have.
