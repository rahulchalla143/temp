CT Pelvis Interval further osseous destruction of distal femoral stump and interval increase in size of surrounding soft tissue phlegmon and fluid collections   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 9427**] is a 38 year old male with PMH significant for paraplegic [**1-17**] gunshot wounds, bilateral BKA/AKA with history of recurrent osteomyelitis on Vanc/Flagyl with noncompliance now presents with increase pain & worsening ulcer on AKA stump.
He was evaluated by vascular surgery who took the patient to the OR and debrided the wound and performed a flap closure.
The patient's Hct dropped from 29-->24 post operatively, and the patient was given 2 U on [**7-8**].
On [**7-10**] his Hct was noted to be 21.8 but the patient refused ongoing Hct checks and blood transfusions.
Subsequently on [**7-11**] the patient triggered on the floor for HR 130s, SBP 88.
His Hct was found to be 20.8 and he was noted to have active bleeding from his stump site.
After his ligation he remained without bleeding from the site and his Hct increased to 30 on the day of discharge without requiring further transfusion.
