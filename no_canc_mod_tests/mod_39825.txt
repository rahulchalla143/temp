A chest tube was placed and her lung reexpanded 80% by CXR over night.
She has been sedated and mechanically ventilated (FiO2 .5 and airway pressures in high 20s, low 30s).
Family History: Brother - cystic fibrosis Mother - died age 87 [**1-13**] CHF (?
lung disease) Father - died age 64 colon cancer  Physical Exam: Vitals - HR 93 SBP 94/64 RR 8 O2100% on AC 350 x 14 100% FIO2 5 PEEP General - sedated, follows simple commands HEENT - PERRL Neck - supple, transtracheal catether in place; insertion site clean, dry, and intact CV - RRR Lungs - diffuse rhonchi Abdomen - soft, NT/ND Ext - 1+ edema bilateral lower extreities   Pertinent Results: [**2119-12-16**] ECHO: The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-9-27**], the right ventricule is more dilated and hypokinetic.
[**2119-12-16**] Liver U/S - 1.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
During the course of the next few hours, her shock progressed very rapidly, resulting in essentially two cardiac arrests (no CPR, but bolus epinephrine required for SBP > 50).
They expressed that, given the extremely high probability of death in this situation -- and her ongoing quality of life -- Ms. [**Known lastname 5444**] would not want to continue on life support in the present circumstances.
