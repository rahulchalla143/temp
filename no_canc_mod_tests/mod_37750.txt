HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year-old African American male with a very complicated past surgical in [**2151**] complicated by a large ventral hernia, which was repaired with a large prosthetic mesh.
The patient's hernia repair was complicated by a prolonged hospital stay with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tracheostomy and ultimately an enterocutaneous fistula, which was treated with multiple abdominal wound debridements and was definitively treated with an exploratory laparotomy with a small bowel patient's postoperative course was complicated by a deep venous thrombosis in which an IVC filter was placed.
The patient was evaluated in the Emergency Room and was aggressively resuscitated and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for serial hematocrits and hemodynamic monitoring.
A GI consult was obtained on [**2163-11-4**].
The patient underwent an upper endoscopy, which showed mild gastritis but no active bleeding and no obvious source for his large blood volume loss.
The patient continued to have gastrointestinal bleeding and was transfused 9 units of packed red blood cells as well as plasma and on [**2163-11-5**] underwent a bleeding scan, which demonstrated brisk positivity in the cecal region.
On [**2163-11-6**] the vasopressin was stopped in the evening and the patient was stable until the evening of [**2163-11-7**] when he began passing copious amounts of bright red blood per rectum again.
The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy through the previous mesh incision and a partial right colectomy with a primary anastomosis was performed.
A Cardiology consult was obtained and no requirement for intervention was necessary.
The patient was restarted on his preoperative medications with advance to a regular diet as he showed bowel function and on postoperative day five he was discharged to home with a stable hematocrit and no further bright red blood per rectum and no further ventricular ectopy by telemetry.
Difficult Blood Cross-Match  IMAGING STUDIES ON THIS ADMISSION:  Red blood cell scan, plain films and an angiogram.
