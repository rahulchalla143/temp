The patient had a stool sample taken [**5-13**] that was positive for C.difficile and her pcp referred her into the emergency department for persistent diarrhea.
In the ED she was febrile with a temperature of 102.3F, HR 87, BP 94/47, RR 18, and O2 sat of 95% (supplemental oxygen not recorded).
A CXR demonstrated increased interstitial opacities of the right lung with bilateral pleural effusions felt consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema.
CHF EF 45% on ventriculography on ccath [**1-11**] 3.

WBC 32K with a bandemia.
She was initially started on PO flagyl, and her WBC count increased to 40,000 on this therapy.
CT scan of the abdomen was obtained which showed thickening throughout the colon with some stranding, but no abscess, toxic megacolon, or perforation.
Now on exam there may be a component of left heart failure with bibasilar rales.
Patient is TBW overloaded with lower extremity edema (it is unusual for her to have LE edema and none noted on her admission exam last month).
She was given multiple fluid boluses without improvement in blood pressure (lasix held).
ARF: Creatinine at baseline was 1.3-1.6.
Her creatinine continued to rise and was 3.4 at time of transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (with minimal urine output).
Cause of this was thought to be a combination of prerenal azotemia (FeNa calculated as 0.3%) and secondary to dye nephropathy (got CT scan on [**5-16**] with IV contrast, did receive IVF prior to scan).
Creatinine continued to rise, and she expired from presumed sepsis as above (blood pressure without response to fluids and pressors).
LVEF from [**1-11**] is 45%, unclear if her systolic dysfunction has progressed.
CXR today with possible asymmetric right sided pulmonary edema.
Repeat TTE showed EF=60% with 1-2+ MR.  As above, CVP was somewhat elevated when measured in the ICU (?diastolic dysfunction).
She was initially monitored on telemetry with no events.
