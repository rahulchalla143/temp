PLEASE REFER TO THIS ADDENDUM FOR A MORE ACCURATE HOSPITAL COURSE AND FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE STUDIES PERFORMED DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16988**] IGM TITER         SEE BELOW           <1:16 TITER  endoscopy: Ulcer in the cardia; Erosion in the stomach body; Erythema and congestion in the stomach body and antrum compatible with gastritis; There was no blood or active bleeding noted.
CT left shoulder:  Limited examination due to lack of IV contrast.
Moderate joint effusion in the left shoulder and lymph nodes, as described above.
If peripheral IV axis is obtained, the patient can receive repeat examination as clinically indicated.
RUE U/S: Focused grayscale and color ultrasound of the right antecubital fossa was performed.
CT RUE: 7.4 x 2.3 x 2.2 cm multilobulated peripherally enhancing mass in the antecubital fossa, most consistent with necrotic lymph nodes given patient's history of cat scratch disease.
Although this peripherally enhancing mass is likely extracapsular in location, given the lack of posterior fat-pad displacement, an ultrasound examination is recommended to better exclude an infectious arthropathy.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are  normal (LVEF>55%).
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 yo woman with history of mitral valve repair (x3) on coumadin, tricuspid valave annuloplasty ring, atrial fibrillation, and recent cat scratch who presented with 4 days of melena and a hematocrit of 10.8, as well as INR of >88.
Her INR was reversed with vitamin K, and her hematocrit remained stable.
Her hematocrit stabilized and she continued to pass guaiac positive, although not melanotic, stool.
On her last two days of hospitalization she passed guaiac negative stool.
The patient was instructed to follow up with our GI department for a repeat endoscopy as an outpatient in [**6-20**] weeks.
Colonoscopy was not performed as an inpatient but this could be considered for more complete outpatient work up.
The patient's coumadin was initially held, she was given FFP as above, and after reversal of her INR with vitamin K, she was restarted on coumadin after her INR fell below 2.5.
She was dishcarged on this dose and instructed to have her INR checked 2d after discharge (on Monday) and twice per week subsequently.
She was found to grow [**4-16**] blood cultures bottles of pasteurella and was treated with ceftriaxone.
TTE and TEE were performed and no vegetation was visualized, however a paravalvular leak was noted around her mechanical mitral valve.
Plain films, CT scan, and bone scan were all negative for osteomyelitis.
Upper extremity ultrasounds showed no DVT, but did show some left antecubital necrotic lymph nodes.
CT of her left shoulder showed no sign of osteomyelitis or effusion.
Repeat bartonella studies were sent prior to discharge and will be followed up by infectious disease.
She will have an outpatient CT of her R shoulder and L arm one week prior to this appointment.
Her digoxin was discontinued during this admission, as it is a relatively poor rate-controlling [**Doctor Last Name 932**], and she was maintained on norpace and beta blocker as tolerated by her blood pressure.
A TEE performed during her hospitalization showed paravalvular leak.
Spot urine had an elevated protein/Cr ratio, however 24 hour urine collection showed protein in the normal range.
She was instructed to call her PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] follow up appointment in the next 1-2 weeks and to call our gastroenterology department for a follow up endoscopy in the next 6-8 weeks.
She was also instructed ot have her bloodwork drawn for INR check two days after d/c and twice per week after that, and faxed to her usual PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] well as to have labwork faxed to our infectious disease clinic once per week.
