In the Emergency Department, the patient collapsed in the bathroom, was intubated, and was noted to have fevers as well as shortness of breath, and was noted to have a systolic blood pressure in the 60s.
The patient was initially given intravenous fluids, resuscitated, and then started on dopamine which was eventually switched to Levophed to regulate her blood pressure.
First CT scan done without contrast showed concern for bowel ischemia of the semicolon as well as mild hydronephrosis of the left kidney, and a right kidney stone.
A second CT scan with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis was done and was shown to be within normal limits; this was done the day after the first CT was done.
The patient had an electrocardiogram that was done earlier in the Emergency Department which showed ST-T wave depressions in the lateral leads, but the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction per cardiac enzymes.
Also, there was concern for aortic dissection since the patient complained of right upper quadrant radiating to the back, but the CT scan results were negative for aortic dissection.
Before transfer, it was noted that there was a first set of stool cultures drawn that were negative for Clostridium difficile.
Congestive heart failure; cardiac catheterization done three weeks ago was within normal limits.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature was 98.6, blood pressure was 120/50, heart rate was 108, respiratory rate was 22, 91% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed right eye pupil was fixed at 4 mm; left eye pupil fixed at 2 mm.
Jugular venous pressure at approximately 7 cm.
Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds diffusely, but more decreased at the bases.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Distal pulses were palpable and 2+.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were normal.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   White blood cell count was 13.7, hemoglobin was 11.2, hematocrit was 34.3, platelets were 180.
Potassium was 4, chloride was 111, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was 17, creatinine was 1, glucose was 151.
Differential with neutrophils of 81.1, lymphocytes of 12.8, monocytes of 5.6, eosinophils of 0.2, basophils of 0.3.
PT was 12.9, PTT was 27.9, INR was 1.2.
Blood acetone level was negative.
Calcium was 7.6, magnesium was 1.6, phosphorous was 4.1.
In the meantime, incentive spirometry was provided at the bedside, daily weights were checked, ins-and-outs were started, and oxygen saturations were monitored, as well as clinical symptoms of shortness of breath.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's first set of Clostridium difficile toxin per stool culture was negative.
The patient's stool cultures were also negative for evidence of Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter.
Blood cultures done showed no growth to date times three days.
Urine cultures showed a result of 7000 organisms per milliliter which was noted to most likely be due to asymptomatic bacteruria.
The patient's white blood cell count steadily decreased (trended lower) to the day of discharge when it was 5.3.
RENAL:  The patient's creatinine as well as blood urea nitrogen was normal throughout the hospital stay, and therefore was monitored.
ANEMIA:  The patient had a hematocrit drop from 38.8 to 34.3 upon transfer, though it was stabilized on the day of discharge from a value of 34.1; therefore, the acute drop in hematocrit was most likely secondary to hemodilution due to aggressive intravenous fluid hydration in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
No further workup was done regarding anemia.
Fingerstick blood sugars were stable in the low 100s to high 90s throughout the hospital stay.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a lipid study done which were all within the normal range.
Triglycerides were 106, high-density lipoprotein was 31, cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein ratio was 35, low-density lipoprotein was 57.
NPH 75/regular 25; 50 units q.a.m.
