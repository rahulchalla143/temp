The study is nearly nondiagnostic as there is also respiratory motion.
IMPRESSION: Nearly nondiagnostic study due to massive body habitus and AP portable technique.
Pt uses BiPAP at night at with the following settings: IPAP 22 and EPAP 12.
- Will need electrolytes to monitor K and Creatinine twice a week - Will need to remain on 2L fluid restriction - Needs agressive physical therapy in order to improve respiratory status .
Serial blood cultures were negative although patient was intermittently febrile during stay.
Cardiac surgery was consulted who recommended finishing 6 week course of antibiotics as well as cardiac catheterization prior to evaluation for surgery.
Lastly given worsening aortic valve endocarditis, aggressive afterload reduction was implemented with goal Systolic BP < 160.

4) Morbid Obesity/Severe physical deconditioning: Patient is morbidly obese with BMI > 40.
