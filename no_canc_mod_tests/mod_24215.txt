While you were in the hospital, you were given insulin and intravenous fluids to help control your blood sugars.
It is very important to control your blood sugars at home.
You should check your blood sugars several times per day.
Please check your blood sugar before meals and before bed and use the new scale to determine how much Novolog insulin to use.
Until you see your primary care doctor to review your case, you should not drive as these high blood sugars and confusion pose a serious risk to your health.
