STD in V5 and V6.
CXR ([**12-1**]): There is a somewhat ill-defined, hazy airspace opacity in the left mid-lung zone, partially obscuring the left cardiac silhouette, suggesting consolidation in the lingula.
TTE ([**12-1**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
CXR ([**12-2**]): Since the previous study, there has been development of consolidation at left base.
TEE ([**12-2**]):  The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
CXR [**2142-12-4**] - Marked interval improvement in left pleural effusion, now tiny.
Followup chest x-ray to resolution.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 yo male with a history of MVP who presented with cough and L sided chest pain found to have PNA as well as chronic sever MR.  # Severe MR: The patient has a history of mitral valve proplase and was seen to have severe MR on a TTE with an elarged left atrium suggesting that this is a chronic process.
His had preserved systolic function w/ LVEF > 55%.
Blood cultures were negative at time of discharge.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed 40% mid LAD and D1 stenoses, non-flow limiting and clean RCA and LCX.
His Lipid panel was checked and was pending at time of discharge.
On HD4, CXR showed much improved L pleural effusion (likely improved from diuresis) and slightly improved L lingular infiltrate.
Given nl EF, no ICD evaluation was performed and this was deferred to OP setting once EF stabilized after MV repair.
He was placed on a CIWA scale w/ scocres consistently < 4, and diaphoresis as only sx.

You also underwent cardiac catheterization which showed some plaques, but no flow limiting plaques.
You should also obtain follow up laboratory tests by [**2142-12-7**], a prescription has been provided.
