The patient attends a physical therapy program every week, where she does note bilateral dull shoulder pain, which was different from her anginal pain, previously, which she experienced with mild physical activity.
Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in [**2115**] with cardiac catheterization and RC stent in [**2115-6-15**], [**8-/2119**] catheterization, RCA with 40% stenotic in the midportion, 30% distally, LAD 70% mid portion stenosis, D1 70% to 80% stenosis, left circumflex diffusely diseased and completely occluded beyond the first obtuse marginal branch.
Echocardiogram, [**3-/2121**] revealed ejection fraction of 20% to 25%.
Echocardiogram, [**2121-1-14**], EF 10% to 15%, moderate MR, left ventricular hypokinesis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination, upon presentation, revealed the vital signs of 112/44, heart rate 53, respirations 99% on two liters.
Respirations 22.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs upon admission revealed the following: White blood cell count 6.7, hematocrit 27.2, platelet count 230,000, PT 13.3, PTT 22.6, INR 1.2, sodium 134, potassium 6.2, which was hemolyzed.
Repeat potassium was 5.8.
Chloride 100, bicarbonate 20, BUN 37, creatinine 1.8, glucose 175, urinalysis negative.
CK 215, MB 12, troponin 47.7.
Chest x-ray revealed congestive heart failure, left ventricular enlargement.
CT of the head revealed no hemorrhage, no mass effect, no infarct.
EKG revealed old left bundle branch block, ST segment elevation only about 1  mm elevations in V2 through V5.
The patient was also held on her ACE inhibitor since the creatinine was high and potassium was high.
The patient was monitored on telemetry and did quite well.
The patient continued to remain on heparin drip, and the patient was scheduled for catheterization after the weekend.
On [**2121-9-30**], the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation, which is new.
The atrial fibrillation was accompanied by systolic blood pressure dropping into the 70s and heart rate jumping into the 120s.
The patient also noted an episode of right shoulder pain at that time and EKG revealing atrial fibrillation and rate-related ST segment changes.
The patient was given two fluid boluses of 250 normal saline, which resulted in systolic blood pressure coming up to 85 and decreased heart rate to 95.
While in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the patient underwent cardioversion, which resulted in temporary normal sinus rhythm.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, during which time RCA stent was placed.
The patient's hematocrit was low, and the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
Urine culture at that time was also found be positive as was the chest x-ray with a question of left lobe infiltrate.
The patient was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for a ten-day course due to the possibility of aspiration pneumonia with the intubation, as well as positive urine culture for E. coli.
It was suggested that the patient's ACE and beta blocker were to be restarted, but she remained in CHF and the beta blocker was deferred.
IV Vancomycin was also started, while she was in the coronary care unit for one out of four bottles positive for gram-positive cocci, which was possibly thought to be a contaminate, but secondary to the presence of central line.
Of note, on the day prior to discharge from coronary care unit, the patient had an echocardiogram done, which revealed severely depressed LV systolic function, ejection fraction of 20% to 25%, anteroseptal inferior hypokinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere.
Hemolysis labs were performed, which were not consistent with acute hemolysis, only an LDH, which had been elevated.
Iron stains were not performed since she had received three units of packed red blood cells and this would confound the results of iron studies.
Surveillance cultures were taken and pending results of the cultures, the patient was to have the Vancomycin discontinued or PICC line placed.
