[**8-17**] Head CT  No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
[**8-17**] CXR Partial collapse of the right middle lobe; no definite underlying pneumonia, but considering the clinical presentation and severe leukocytosis, a chest CT could be performed to exclude both pneumonia and an endobronchial lesion.
[**8-20**] CXR - improved pneumonia, No evidence of layering effusions on either side.
The previously noted right pleural effusion on the study of [**2136-8-19**] has resolved.
Patient presented with temp 101.9, HR 130s, lactate 6.3, WBC of 28.6, and 96% on RA (100% on NRB).
CXR showed partial collapse of the right middle lobe and recommended CT scan for better evaluation of what caused the collapse (likely a pneumonia).
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis identified a RLL pneumonia but no abscess or other foci of fever in pelvis.
Abdominal CT and urinalysis were negative for other fever sources and urine cx is negative at time of discharge.
Blood cultures x2 were obtained and are negative at time of discharge.
Pt complained of achiness all over, stiff neck, photophobia and a fever, so an LP was performed to r/o meningitis.
Gram stain of her CSF showed no microorganisms and only 1 WBC, 3 RBC on cell count.
CSF cx was negative at time of discharge.
CXray on [**8-20**] demonstrated improvement of her pneumonia and complete resolution of the pleural effusion.
No further imaging is required.
Psych/Benzo/EtOH withdrawal: Pt was placed on a CIWA scale with diazepam 5-10mg IV q2-4h prn for CIWA >10.
Hepatitis C. 3.
