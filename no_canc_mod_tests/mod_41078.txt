Had a left pleural effusion on chest x-ray and trauma placed an apical left chest tube.
The temperature decreased with Tylenol and she did not note a fever this morning.
In the Emergency Room got a Atomadate 20 intravenous times one, Succinyl choline one intravenous times one, Propofol for sedation (blood pressure decreased on the Propofol) also received Fentanyl 500 mg intravenous times five and 1 mg of Versed.
Gets CT scans every six months to evaluate.
ITP in [**2117**].
Congestive heart failure with last echo in [**2120-4-1**] revealing an EF of 35 to 40%  Mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy, mild LAE, lateral and posterior hypokinesis, 1 to 2+ MR, +2 Tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.5, heart rate 96, blood pressure 146/76 then 106/38, then an SPT in the 90's, respiratory rate 36, O2 sat 100%  General:  Elderly woman sedated and intubated.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Eyes are taped shut.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the left base, left chest tube is in place.
Extremities:  warm 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
DATA:  White blood count 5.6, hematocrit 33.3, platelets 130 with a differential of 13 polys, 0 bands and 60 lymphocytes.
135 sodium, potassium 4.4, chloride 95, bicarbonate 18, BUN 63, creatinine 2.2.
Glucose 76.
Anion gap of 22, a lactate of 5.2.
A Urinalysis revealed 100 protein, trace ketones, small bili, no leukocytes or nitrates.
3 to 5 red blood cells, 0 to 2 white blood cells, 0 to 2 epis.
T-wave inversions in V4, V5 and V6, 2, 3, L (old) and a flat T-wave in F.  2.
Pelvis CT was negative.
ASSESSMENT:  This is an 86-year-old woman with a one day history of fever, nausea, status post a fall this morning and later presented with increased short of breath, O2 desaturations requiring intubation with a left lower lobe pneumonia and effusion, status post a chest tube, and metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate likely secondary to sepsis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Room blood pressure had decreased to the 90's, however, this was attributed to recent sedation and the patient was stable otherwise.
Within hours of transfer to the floor the patient's blood pressure began to drop and a Neo-Synephrine drip was started.
Pleural fluid revealed an exudative effusion with a low glucose (2) likely representing a parapneumonic effusion.
Blood pressures continued to fall ultimately requiring four pressors (Neo-Synephrine, Dopamine, Dobutamine, and Vasopressor).
Respiratory rate and total volumes on the vent were increased in an attempt to decrease her pACO2.
She began to brady done and at one point her heart rate was in the 30's and then briefly in asystole which responded to compressions, Epinephrine, Atropine and bicarbonate.
Her Troponin returned at greater than 50 with negative CKs and a repeat Electrocardiogram showed more pronounced ST depression.
Cardiology was called and since there was no pericardial effusion on CT it was felt that depressed blood pressures were likely not cardiogenic however, she was obviously having an acute myocardial infarction in the setting of sepsis.
Because of the patient's rapid deterioration the family was called and came in.
