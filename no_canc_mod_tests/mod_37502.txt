Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 23 mmHg and PCWP of 36 mmHg.
The cardiac output and cardiac index were depressed at 3.38 L/min and 1.85 L/min/m2 respectively.
Final angiography revealed no residual in-stent stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
# CORONARIES: acute NSTEMI/UA given rise in Troponin after admission, No prior cath history or cardiac hx, EKG with old LBBB, sinus.
She had elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 23 and PCWP of 36.
The cardiac output and cardiac index were depressed at 3.38 L/min and 1.85 L/min/m2 respectively.
# PUMP: Old Echo EF 35-40% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] notes, symptoms (PND, DOE) suggestive of systolic CHF decompensation.
Exam positive for crackles and decreased breathsounds b/l suggestive of overload.
CXR here also suggestive of overload.
An Echo on [**7-23**] showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with severe global hypokinesis (EF 20%).
WBC at [**Hospital1 **] 14.4 on admission, 10.4 on transfer, afebrile while at [**Hospital1 **], afebrile here.
She had a negative swallow evaluation at OSH.
On transfer she was on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for possible CAP which could not be excluded on CXR from OSH d/t severe pulmonary edema.
However, repeat CXR did not show focal consolidation and abx were discontinued.
Due to her CHADS2 = 3, she was bridged from Heparin gtt to coumadin and d/c on lovenox until her INR is therapeutic with a goal INR of [**12-22**].
# SIRS (WBC > 12, RR > 20)- PNA suggested on CXR at [**Hospital1 **], on ABX which were d/c when once diuresed and there was no evidence of focal lung consolidation.
In addition, she was afebrile and WBC was down trending on day of discharge.
# HTN - chronic, currently normotensive 120s-130s, HR 70s-90s, At home on lasix, verap, lisinopril.
