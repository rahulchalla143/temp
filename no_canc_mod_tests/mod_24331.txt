Initially we thought it may have been from the stomach or duodenum beacuse of chronic high does NSAID use; however, the CT was more suggestive of diverticular perforation.
Since she was stable it was decided to admit her to  ICU and watch her closely, following serial abdominal exams and hemodynamics, NPO and PPIs and antibiotics.
The decision to approach this non-operatively initially was based on the history of the acute onset of pain (actually worse than her current pain) more than 24 hrs ago, and the finding on exam that she was stable and her exam was not particularly impressive.
Repeat CT abdomen on [**5-23**] showed :  1.
Repeat CT done on [**2141-5-30**]: 1.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7346**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], several times during this hospitalization to bring her up to date.
