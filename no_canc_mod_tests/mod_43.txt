Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2138-12-2**] which revealed a patent left internal mammary artery graft, occluded OM-1 and OM-2 graft, and a 90% occlusion in the in-stented segment of the PDA.
The last echocardiogram was performed in [**2137-5-21**] which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%.
The vital signs were stable.
The white count was 9.1, hematocrit 31.3, platelet count 147,000 with an unremarkable physical examination.
The plan was to continue to keep his blood pressure down on Nipride and to start the patient on his p.o.
He was still with a low-grade temperature of 100.1 in sinus rhythm at 88, mildly hypertensive at 170/88.
On physical examination, he had mild crackles bilaterally, otherwise his examination was benign.
The vital signs were stable, saturating at 94% on room air.
The physical examination was benign.
The plan was to go for a cardiac catheterization this morning with a possible PTCA with plus or minus stenting of the stenotic area.
He did undergo cardiac catheterization on [**2138-12-11**] which now revealed a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal patent and a saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery with a 90% distal stenosis with a 3 by 13 mm stent with distal protection and 0% residual with normal flow.
NPH 3 units at breakfast, 4 units at bedtime.
