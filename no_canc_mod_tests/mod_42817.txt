Non-contrast head CT showed no acute intracranial process.
Labs were significant for lactate 2.1, AST 161, ALT 241, normal WBC with slight left shift, troponin <0.01, Hgb/Hct 11.6/35.3 (stable), and urinalysis suggestive of infection (0 epis, mod leuk, mod bacteria, WBC 13).
CXR showed worsening CHF with moderate to severe pulmonary edema, increased size of bilateral pleural effusions (R>L), and bibasilar airspace opacities.
An EKG checked prior to transfer to the ICU showed afib with RVR @ 115.
VS on transfer were 99% 4L NC, 138/100, HR 120.

STUDY:  CT of the head without contrast; images were acquired in soft tissue and bone algorithms.
CXR PA/Lateral [**9-5**] HISTORY:  Chest pain.
Evaluation of the right lung apex is obscured due to the patient's chin projecting over this region.
CXR portable [**9-6**] Final Report REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with coronary artery disease, CVA, hypertension and atrial fibrillation.
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to [**9-5**].
Also reports increased shortness of breath for the 2 days prior to admission; CXR in the ED shows worsening CHF with moderate to severe pulmonary edema and increased size of bilateral pleural effusions (R>L).
She had a TTE on [**2121-8-25**] that showed new dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 30%.
HR 100s-140s since presentation.
After loading dose of digoxin, tachycardia resolved to HR in 60-90s, however, loading digoxin was elevated level (1.6, goal is 0.8), thus digoxin was stopped until digoxin levels were therapeutic (digoxin level 0.7 on [**2121-9-15**]).
Urinalysis suggestive of infection with 0 epis, moderate leuk, negative nitrite, moderate bacteria, WBC 13, RBC 1.
Follow up urine culture showed alpha-hemolytic organisms c/w lactobacillus and strep >100,000.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Patient has recently diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy with global hypokinesis and EF 30% on [**2121-8-25**] TTE.
Currently has evidence of volume overload with worsening pulmonary edema on CXR and hypoxia (92% 4L NC); likely related to afib with RVR.
Got lasix diuresis with good urine output and improvement in respiratory symptoms.
# Questionable pneumonia: CXR with RLL infiltrate; atelectasis vs. pleural effusion vs. pneumonia.
TFTs were TSH, T3, T4, free T4 were WNL TSH 0.56 T4 5.0 T3 71 Free T4 1.0.
She is scheduled for endocrinology follow-up, and will need repeat testing including thyroid function tests, spot urine iodine/Cr, and serum metanephrines for adrenal incidentaloma.
Troponin wnl x 2 .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Follow-up with endocrinology regarding thyroid and incidental adrenal mass from prior CT abdomen - The patient should undergo lab testing in 2 weeks for the following: [ ] TFTs [ ] spot urine iodine/cr [ ] consider blood work for adrenal incidentaloma such as pheochromocytoma screening at the same time [ ] follow-up digoxin levels on [**9-17**] or 4th [**2120**] for goal of 0.8 blood dig levels - consider anticoagulation with coumadin as outpatient for atrial fibrillation after risk/benefits discussion - consider addition of statin and ACEi for systolic CHF if liver function remains normal and BP room for lisinopril - repeat CXR in [**3-21**] weeks to establish clearance of pulmonary edema and any possible pneumonia  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
