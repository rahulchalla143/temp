Upon arrival a CT scan of the brain was obtained which showed significant IVH.
As a result of this she was transferred via DHART helicopter to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.
Neuro: Mental status: unresponsive No corneal reflexes, minimal cough/gag  Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils 1.5mm and NR III-XII: unable to assess secondary to clinical status  Motor: no response to noxious in upper extremities, RLE brisk withdrawl, LLE minimal withdrawl  Sensation: unable to asssess  Toes upgoing left, mute right  Coordination: unable to assess  Expired [**2142-7-30**] at 1620  Pertinent Results: [**2142-7-27**] CTA head 1.
CT head demonstrates developing hydrocephalus with extensive intraventricular hemorrhage, predominantly in the fourth ventricle but extending to the third and lateral ventricles.
CT angiography demonstrates slightly ectatic left distal vertebral artery in the V4 segment above the level of foramen magnum could be due to atherosclerotic disease but focal abnormalities such as aneurysm or dissection cannot be excluded given the suboptimal opacification of the vascular structures.
Further evaluation with cerebral angiography can be obtained as clinically indicated.
No other abnormalities on the CT angiography of the head.
