At the OSH they got a head CT which apparently was normal and then a CTA which showed an occlusion of the right vertebral artery, and an occlusion in the top of the basilar artery.

CXR [**2127-10-15**]: Appropriately positioned ET and NG tubes.
ECHO [**2127-10-18**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
MRI/MRA ([**2127-10-16**]): 1.
MRI/MRA ([**2127-10-19**]): Extensive acute infarctions in the bilateral pons, right superior vermis, and right superior and inferior cerebellum, and small acute infarction in the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere, with expected temporal evolution.
- He was plavix loaded in the interventional suite and while he was receiving both plavix and heparin, he was noted to have some oropharyngeal bleeding that was formally addressed by a bronchoscopic evaluation showing the presence of a traumatic lesion in the soft pharynx.
- On the days following his admission, we have noticed an improvement in his overall neurological examination.
- He had a repeat MRI on [**2127-10-19**] which showed completion of his stroke with extensive areas of infarcts in the region of the midbrain and right cerebellum as well as partial recanalization of his right vertebral and basilar artery - His family has remained at his bedside throughout his stay.
Cultures have eventually grown out Coag positive staph aureus for which he is currently receiving IV vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
His INR remained subtherapeutic in spite of three days of 5mg of warfarin QHS, and his dose was increased prior to discharge.
CV: Regular heart sounds, without murmurs or rubs Pulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: Soft without tenderness or distention Extremities: Without edema or clubbing  Neurological Examination: Mental Status: Eyes are open at baseline.
Lower extremities spontaneously extensor posture, also occasional triple flexion on painful stimulation of the lower extremities.
Reflexes are normal throughout, toes are up bilaterally Sensory: Difficult to assess Coordination/Gait: Not tested  Transitional Issues: - Please keep Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 90846**] on warfarin (he needs this for the indefinite future).
He can be on a lovenox bridge to a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
His vancomycin, aztreonam and ciprofloxacin can be safely discontinued on [**2127-11-3**].
6. heparin (porcine) in D5W 25,000 unit/500 mL Parenteral Solution Sig: 1700U/hr  Intravenous Continuous infusion: Until INR reaches a goal of 2.0-3.0.
This was switched over to a "tracheostomy", which is an artificial breathing tube that connects directly to your trachea.
- We initiated you on a medication called IV heparin to keep your blood thin and [**Hospital1 90846**] and prevent future clots.
- In addition to these, you will continue to take CITALOPRAM for depression WARFARIN for blood thinning LISINOPRIL for hypertension SIMVASTATIN for high cholesterol INSULIN as needed for high blood sugars FAMOTIDINE twice daily to prevent stress ulcers in your stomach   Followup Instructions: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 830**], [**Location (un) **], [**Numeric Identifier 718**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3445**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**] Date/Time:[**2127-12-24**] 1:00                                [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) 162**] MD [**MD Number(2) 2575**]  Completed by:[**2127-10-25**
