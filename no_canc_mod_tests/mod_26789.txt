CT scan was performed that demonstrated a large retroperitoneal abscess from a perforation, and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive treatment.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
[**2119-10-27**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
CT GUIDED DRAINAGE: Under CT fluoro guidance an 8-French pigtail catheter was localized and advanced into the right retroperitoneal collection.
Aspiration yielded 25 cc of bloody material, a sample was sent to analysis  [**2119-10-29**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis 1.
[**2119-11-4**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis 1.
Persistent fracture lucency is seen through the distal fibula; however, it appears somewhat less distinct on the current exam as compared with [**2119-10-29**].
[**2119-11-15**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis 1.
[**2119-11-16**] CT guided drainage of fluid collection   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the SICU and put on broad spectrum antibiotics and volume resuscitated.
He was taken emergently to the OR for exploratory laparotomy for surgical repair of a duodenal perforation.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**10-26**] which showed LVEF 70-80% with trivial MR. A CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on [**10-27**] showed fluid throughout the abdomen and bilateral pleural effusions in addition to a large right-sided retroperitoneal collection which was subsequently drained under CT guidance.
The JP drain had evidence of a bile leak at this point but it was well-drained.
A follow-up CT on [**10-29**] showed an interval decrease in the free fluid and in the size of the right retroperitoneal collection with the pigtail in place.
Culture data revealed VRE and the vanco was changed to Linezolid.
Cultures also grew klebsiella, MRSA, and yeast.
A follow-up C.diff was negative on [**11-10**].
Radiology performed a CT-guided drainage of the right retroperitoneum on [**11-16**] after a follow-up CT from [**11-15**] showed a persistent collection.
Follow-up C.Diff toxins have been negative and a follow-up JP drain culture is pending.
