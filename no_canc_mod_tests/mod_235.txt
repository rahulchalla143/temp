CXR was consistent with CHF and ECG showed signs of mild ST depression in I, aVL and poor R wave progression.
Pt ruled in for NSTEMI with CK peak of 207 and trop peak of 2.22 while in the MICU.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right-sided filling pressures (PCWP mean 28 mmHg), borderline pulmonary hypertension (PA mean 40 mmHg) 3.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial LAD with a 2.5 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent, which was post-dilated to 3.0 mm."
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 67yo female with CAD s/p MI, DMII with ESRD presents with acute onset SOB after dialysis who ruled in for NSTEMI with CK peak of 207 and troponin peak of 2.22.
SOB: The patient received a portable Echo in the MICU which showed new changes with "moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls" and an EF of 30%.
On the floor, the patient was monitored on telemetry for 48 hours without incident.
