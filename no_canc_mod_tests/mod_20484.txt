HISTORY:  This is a 32 week gestational age infant male born to a 28 year old G-1, para 0, mother with the following prenatal labs: Blood type is O positive, antibody negative, hep B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, GC and Chlamydia negative, HIV negative and GBS unknown.
Pregnancy was complicated by: 1.
Infant was born via C-section due to nonreassuring fetal heart rate on [**2157-10-4**], at 8:13 a.m.
Infant emerged with spontaneous cry but then noted to be apneic for 20 to 30 seconds and a heart rate down to 80.
Positive pressure ventilation was given for 1 minute with improved heart rate and respiratory effort and tone.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Birth weight was 1645 grams (50th percentile), length 42 cm (25th to 50th percentile and head circumference was 30 cm (50th to 75th percentile).
Temperature stable, heart rate 150, respiratory rate 52, blood pressure mean was over 40.
Distal pulses 2+.
Chest x- ray shows HMD versus TTN.
Cardiac: The patient was noted in the second week of life to have a murmur which on echocardiogram on [**10-20**], showed a small muscular VSD.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout admission without need for blood pressure support.
Initial hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin max of 19.9/0.7.
On [**10-28**], his hematocrit was 30.4 and he is receiving iron therapy.
ID:  Patient underwent sepsis evaluation at birth with negative cultures and 48 hours of antibiotics.
Repeat sepsis evaluation was performed on day 6 for hypothermia that was unremarkable.
Neurology:  Exam remained appropriate throughout.
Opthalmology exam and head ultrasounds were not indicated given advanced gestational age.
RHCM:  Hearing screen was passed on [**2157-11-14**].
Newborn screens were sent [**10-25**] and [**11-2**] and were within normal limits.
Hepatitis B vaccination was received on [**11-3**].
Finally, although this infant has appeared well throughout admission, some members of the care team questioned mildly dysmorphic features; given mother's developmental delays and dysmorphisms, a genetic evaluation of this family can be considered as an outpatient.
