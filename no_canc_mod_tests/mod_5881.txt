The patient underwent a stress test on [**7-29**] which was markedly positive.
The patient began experiencing angina and was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Preoperative physical examination revealed his heart rate was 70 ventricularly paced, his blood pressure was 130/88, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed atraumatic and within normal limits.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremity examination revealed extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Preoperative electrocardiogram showed a left bundle-branch block, a normal sinus rhythm, and nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
The cardiac catheterization showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction.
Angiography showed an 80% distal left main occlusion, proximal mild diffuse left anterior descending artery disease, with mild thrombotic total occlusion of the distal vessel, and an 80% right coronary artery lesion.
The patient's chest tubes were removed, and a subsequent chest x-ray was without pneumothorax or effusion.
It was decided to obtain an Ear/Nose/Throat consultation.
The Ear/Nose/Throat team performed a fiberoptic laryngoscopy at the bedside which showed the patient's left vocal cord was dysfunctional.
The bedside Speech and Swallow evaluation determined that the patient was probably aspirating while drinking thin liquids.
Subsequently, on postoperative day six, the patient underwent a videoscopic swallow evaluation which showed the patient was not aspirating thin liquids.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature maximum was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate was 99, blood pressure was 122/86, respiratory rate was 20, and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
Neurologic examination was grossly intact.
The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation and without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.
Extremity examination revealed the right lower extremity was without edema.
