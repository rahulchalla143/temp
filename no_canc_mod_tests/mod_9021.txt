She was noted on admission to the OSH to have worsening renal failure with BUN61 and Cr 4.7.
She underwent a swallow eval, at which time she choked, leading to respiratory distress, and was intubated.
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt had MRI/MRA and CT which showed a subacte infarct involving the R globus pallidus and internal capsule.
OSH CT - with small vessle ischemic changes.
NCHCT - Subacute infarct involving the right globus pallidus and internal capsule.
MRI - Diffusion and adc abnormalities in the area corresponding to the NCHCT.
Renal U/S - Limited study without evidence of hydronephrosis or large mass.
Foot XR - no areas of bony erosion are seen to suggest osteomyelitis.
ECHO - the left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to cooperate.
Carotid U/S - no significant stenosis .
Bone Scan - IMPRESSION:  Abnormal study with intense increased radiotracer uptake on all three phases in the right ankle region.
An indium labeled WBC scan may be obtained for further differentiation as clinically [**Name (NI) 9304**].
MICRO: OSH Wound Cx - group B strep, pseudomonas aeruginosa OSH BCx - No growth UCx - enterococcous, R to Amp, S to Vanco WCx - strep, coag neg BCx - NGTD .
Labs on admission: [**2144-1-17**] GLUCOSE-142* UREA N-58* CREAT-4.8* SODIUM-148* POTASSIUM-5.6* CHLORIDE-119* TOTAL CO2-19* ANION GAP-16  CALCIUM-8.4 PHOSPHATE-4.5 MAGNESIUM-2.0 .

URINE  BLOOD-MOD NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-100 GLUCOSE-TR KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-5.0 LEUK-SM  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 7563**] is a 54 year-old female with an extensive past medical history including DM, PVD, HTN, and nephropathy transferred for acute stroke and possible TPA.
Based on the imaging there was no vascular cutoff on which to intervene despite a subacute infarct in the right thalmus/internal capsule.
CT head ([**2144-1-17**]) revealed subacute infarct involving the right globus pallidus and internal capsule.
MRI brain ([**2144-1-17**]) revealed correlated increased signal intensity in the posterior limb of the internal capsule.
The patient's systolic blood pressue was targeted to 140-180 to maintain adequate watershed perfusion.
On carotid ultrasound the patient had no significant stenosis.
Lower extremity ultrasound did reveal bilateral tibial artery disease.
Echo on [**2144-1-20**] was a limited study though revealed no intracardiac source of embolus and no PFO.
# CV: The patient's EKG showed T wave flattening in I and aVL in the setting of negative serial cardiac enzymes.
A TTE showed and EF > 55%.
CXR [**1-19**] showed fluid overload, and she was given Lasix 20mg IV and 0.5 in nitropaste for hypertension.
She had a foot ulcer that probed to bone at that time and MRI revealed bony changes concerning for osteomyelitis.
The patient underwent podiatric debridement at the OSH at that time and cultures from that procedure grew group B strep and pseudomonas.
She underwent bone scan on [**2144-1-23**] with signs of abnormal tracer uptake in the ankle of unclear significance possibly consistent with osteo, fracture or chacot foot.
The patient had a repeat MRI while in the hospital at [**Hospital1 18**] revealing bony abnormalities consistent with osteomyelitis though also possibly consistent with charcot foot.
The patient also underwent lower extremity vascular studies revealing no clear intervenable vascular deficits.
Her prior baseline Cr was in the range of [**4-7**].
UA was consistent with significant proteinuria and infection.
Ueos were positive and microscopy revealed sheets of WBC's concerning for AIN.
Urine micoscopy also revealed muddy brown castst consistent with ATN possibly due to hypotension at the time of recent CVA.
HD was discontinued, she was given IVF bolus and blood cultures were sent.
She will follow-up in outpatient orthopedic clinic and should get repeat MRI in [**7-16**] months.
She will need outpatient hemodialysis to be continued on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday scheduled.
