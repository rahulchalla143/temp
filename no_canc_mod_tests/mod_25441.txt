At the OSH, she underwent a head CT which revealed a large, diffuse SAH and was subsequently Medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical management.
[**8-4**] CT head: IMPRESSION: 1.
The left lateral ventricle is smaller than on the study of [**2119-8-4**].
There is a small focus of hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, adjacent to the hematoma and coil, new since the study of [**2119-8-4**], and likely reflecting infarction.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[**8-11**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-8-9**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is higher.
[**8-14**] EEG This monitoring of cerebral function from [**Date range (1) 10831**]/[**2118**] showed a profoundly suppressed background at the beginning and throughout the recording.
[**2119-8-15**] CTA head 1.
Air-fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses.
[**2119-8-19**] CT head Overall unchanged appearance of the ventricles.
[**2119-8-20**] CT head 1.
No new intracranial hemorrhage  [**2119-8-22**]: CT head 1.
Review of prior studies suggests that there was prior hemorrhage into this lesion.
ECG [**2119-8-30**]: Sinus rhythm and frequent atrial ectopy in a trigeminal pattern.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2119-8-24**] no diagnostic interim change.
An external ventricular drain was placed for hydrocephalus and shortly thereafter her exam improved tremendously to the point that she became arrousable and was following all comands and moving all four extremities.
On [**8-5**] her neurological exam was good therefore [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] was raised to 20.
Continuous EEG monitoring was initiated per vasospasm protocol.
Her neurological exam remained stable.
Pt noted to have increase heart rate into 150's and EKG showed atrial fibrilation.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and they were negative.
She was febrile on this day and blood, urine, sputum and CSF cultures were sent.
[**8-8**] Upon examination she was noted to be more lethargic and oriented only to her self and not year or location.
A stat head ct showed no change from prior exam and no hydrocephalus or infarct.
Her SBP goal was increased to 140-160 and this did improve her mental status somewhat and she was following commands with all extremities and oriented to year.
On [**8-12**] a Head CT was performed and stable.
On [**8-13**] head CT was again stable.
neurological exam was hindered by sedation.
Continous EEG revealed ********  exam still hindered.
CSF was sent due to longevity of [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] catheter.
On [**8-19**] [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] was discontinued and a final set of CSF was sent after a successful clamping trial.
On [**8-26**] her nimodipine was discontinued, as she was past day 21.
On [**8-30**] she was noted to have some telemetry changes and cardiac enzymes were done which showed a Troponin of 0.02 which repeat Troponin was 0.08 then trended down [**Date range (1) 43500**].
ECG was unchanged.
Coumadin was started for a goal INR of [**12-27**].5.
[**8-31**] Coumadin was increased, Heparin gtt continued, PTT within range, INR not within goal.
Speech eval done and PMV placed.
[**9-1**] INR not within range.
4. heparin (porcine) in D5W 25,000 unit/250 mL Parenteral Solution [**Hospital1 **]: 1350 (1350) units/hr Intravenous ASDIR (AS DIRECTED): PTT 60-80 Keep until INR goal obtained.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
10. warfarin 5 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: Two (2) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: GOAL INR 2-2.5.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush Temporary Central Access-ICU: Flush with 10mL Normal Saline daily and PRN.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
