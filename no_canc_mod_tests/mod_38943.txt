CT Chest 1.
He was eventually transitioned to po bumetamide and discharged home with physical therapy as he was able maintained good oxygen saturation with ambulation on 3LNC.
# History of IPF: Patient's pulmonologist was on vacation when he was admitted, but OSH records showed that patient was initially admitted on [**4-/2148**] with bilateral pneumonia, and during this admission he was bronch'd and infectious etiologies were ruled out and he had a transthoracic biopsy which was used to get the diagnosis of IPF.
Patient's CT scan here was not consistent with IPF and it is not the usual standard here to diagnose IPF on transbronchial biopsy (typically transthoracic).
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient's creatinine 2.2 on admission, up from 1.6 recently.
Initially concerned for GI bleed still in ddx esp with INR of 3.5 but patient guiac negative and had no BRBPR.
Patient's iron studies showed iron deficiency.
INR supratherapeutic, so his warfarin was initially held which led to it being subtherapeutic.
Coumadin was increased to 7.5 mg to maintain goal INR [**3-13**].
Please check electrolytes and kidney function at the next visit and decide whether to decrease bumetamide to qdaily instead of [**Hospital1 **] based on volume status and kidney function.
Please check INR and adjust coumadin dose according.
CT scan revealed a multilobar pneumonia.
