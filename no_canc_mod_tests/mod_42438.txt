PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, blood pressure 159/72, pulse 73, temperature 37.2, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters.
Motor examination:  Normal tone, 4/5 strength in the left deltoid, 4+/5 in the left triceps, [**2-22**] in the left wrist extensors and finger extensors, 4-/5 in the left iliopsoas, [**2-22**] in the left hamstrings and tibialis anterior, 4-/5 in the left toe extensors.
Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch.
Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric, with downgoing toes bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Done at an outside hospital, with most of the records missing but by report, his INR was 0.95.
A chest x-ray showed a left upper lobe resection, with no infiltrates on the right.
Head CT showed a large right caudate and basal ganglia hemorrhage with extension into the right lateral ventricle, third ventricle and fourth ventricle, with minimal shift.
His blood pressure was controlled with intravenous labetalol.
Follow-up CT scans of his head showed increased blood in the ventricles, but without hydrocephalus and, at most, a minimal increase in the amounts of midline shift.
His white count increased to 20, but the following day decreased to 15, and remained stable at that point.
On Friday, [**9-6**], speech and swallow study was done which showed silent aspiration of thin liquids.
On Sunday, his blood pressure was noted to be high.
A post-void residual was done which showed over 400 cc of fluid, and a Foley was placed, with relief of his blood pressure.
A repeat straight catheterization again showed a large post-void residual, and the Foley was again placed.
The patient will need urologic workup at some time in the future to evaluate for benign prostatic hypertrophy or prostatic cancer.
