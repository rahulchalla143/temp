She became hypotensive and required a levophed drip for blood pressure maintanence.
A CT of her head and torso did not [**Doctor Last Name **] any pathology for her decompensation.
A liver ultrasound did not have signs of cholecystitis.
With her continued need for vasopressor support without objective culture data demonstrating sepsis and TTE was performed on [**2167-2-6**] which showed hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function, mild aortic stenosis and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Her hypotension continued to improve and the levophed was discontinued.
A postpyloric Dobhoff tube was placed by interventional radiology on [**2167-2-9**] and tube feeds were started.
She further underwent a cardiac cath following her elevation in cardiac enzymes which showed circumflex 80% mid vessel tubular stenosis.
She received a video swallow study which did not show aspiration risk, therefore her diet was advanced.
