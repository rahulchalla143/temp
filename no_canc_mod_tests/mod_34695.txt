Pt underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2129-8-25**], complicated by likely femoral artery lacteration.
Cath revealed 3 VD - 100% occlusion of proximal RCA, long 70% stenosis of mid LAD, and long 80% stenosis of mid-LCx.
CT scan as below (6x6 cm hematoma with no evidence of active extravasation).
Troponin peak at OSH 0.51 (MB 13.6 on [**8-25**]; patient had another bump in cardiac enzymes here peaking at troponin 9.45 with CKs 2429 (162).
Review of symptoms deferred [**1-22**] patient intubation/sedation; refer to prior admit note for further details.
Past Medical History: - Obesity - HTN - Diabetes type II x 15 years (patient has refused multiple treatments for this in the past) - Peripheral neuropathy - PVD (details unknown) - Hyperlipidemia   Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death  Physical Exam: On Transfer to CCU: VS: Tc 100.1, Tm 101.1, BP 127/60 (85-132), HR 78, RR 13, O2 97% on AC 0.5 FiO2, 700 x12 PEEP 8 Gen: obese female NAD, intubated and sedated HEENT: NCAT.
ETT in place Neck: Supple with JVP of at least 5 cm ASA.
Bilat DP and PT pulses palbable but R PT somewhat weak.
Pertinent Results: [**2129-9-5**] echo There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-8-30**], left ventricular function is similar.
[**2129-9-5**] CT torso 1.
Residual contrast in the kidneys from a recent cardiac catheterization suggesting acute renal failure.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 F with morbid obesity, DM II, HTN; transfer from OSH with 3VD on cath and RP bleed due to femoral artery laceration.
Recieved coronary catheterization which showed 3vd and no intervenable culprit lesion.
While being treated for her VAP she became hypotensive and an EKG showed new ST elevations, she was taken to the cath lab and recieved a BMS to the LCx and transfered back to CCU w/ balloon pump/pressors.
She appeared to be severely volume overloaded w/ edema and wet lung exam and needed to be diuresed several liters before she could be extubated.
She should continue to be monitored on telemetry at the acute rehab facility.
Although we believe that her risk of ventricular tachycardia is minimal now that the ischemic insult has been removed, she should continue to have close monitoring of her heart rhythm.
# VAP: CXR/chest CT was not impressive for PNA, but when Abx were stopped her WBC increased dramatically and she spiked fevers.
High dose unasyn was started and her fevers stopped, her hypotension began to resolve and her WBC's gradually decreased to normal.
Her septic shock initially prompted concern for abdominal source as she grimaced when pressure was applied to her RUQ and her labs were concerning for cholestasis.
RUQ u/s was negative and her labs were attributed to intrahepatic cholestasis secondary to systemic sepsis.
Her creatinine continued to trend downward until several days before d/c at which point it increased and it was decided that she had probably been overdiuresed.
# Hypertension: After extubation her blood pressure was elevated, even after uptitration of her BB and ACEI.
This resulted in excellent diuresis and blood pressure control.
