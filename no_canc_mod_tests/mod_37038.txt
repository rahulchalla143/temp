Later in the afternoon, she began to have a "burning" sensation from her epigastrium up into her mouth/jaw.
Pain was worse with lying down, associated with some dizziness and diaphoresis, but no shortness of breath, nausea, or palpitations.
ECG notable for SR @ 89 with ?ST-elevations and hyperacute T waves in anterolateral leads with Q waves that are new compared to last prior ECG in [**2107**].
Troponin was 0.04, MB (added on later) was 5, hct was decreased to 29 from previous baseline 35.
LFTs revealed bili 4.4 (4.1 indirect), so RUQ obtained and showed gallstones with no sign of obstruction.
CXR showed no acute abnormalities.
Bedside US showed small pericardial effusion but no evidence of aortic dissection (no comment on WMAs).
Shortly after her arrival, she began to have chest pain again, same in quality as her previous chest pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for: + chest pain, syncope and presyncope (most recently last week) - dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations  Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Rhematoid arthritis - Gallstones - s/p hysterectomy - s/p appendectomy  Social History: Lives with her sister (also in her 90s) in [**Location (un) 1468**], MA.

Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial blood pressure with a central aortic blood pressure of 109/49 mmHg.
Successful PTCA and stenting of distal LMCA into LAD origin with 3.0x18mm Integrity bare metal stent with proximal stent segment postdilated to 4.0mm.
Successful distal LMCA-LAD PCI with BMS 4.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-7-11**] pericardial effusion is slightly larger.
Right heart catheterization initially revealed low-normal right sided and minimally elevated left sided filling pressures.
The pulmonary arterial pressure was normal at 30/12 mmHg with a mean PA pressure of 18 mmHg.
The cardiac output and index were normal at 5.5 L/min and 3.5  L/min/m2.
Systemic vascular resistance was normal at 814 dyne-sec/cm5, and pulmonary vascular resistance was normal at 86 dyne-sec/cm5.
There was a 9% step up in oxygen saturation between the RA and PA, but a significant amount of time had ellapsed between these two measurements, and in the interim the patient's respiratory status was not stable.
Additional resting hemodynamics revealed a low-normal systemic arterial bloood pressure with a central aortic blood pressure of 96/40 mmHg.
[**2110-7-12**] TTE: This study is a series of images during pericardiocentesis.
The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-7-12**], no major change.
ECG showed evolving/worsening ST-elevations in the anteroseptal leads.
Next cardiac enzymes rose, overall trend:  trop 0.04-> 0.35-> 1.36 -> 2.13 and MB 5-> 41-> 103.
Bedside echo showed anterior wall hypokinesis with depressed EF of 25% (from 75%) prompting transfer to the cath lab.
Will follow up with Dr.[**Name8 (MD) 5103**] NP in clinic on [**2110-8-19**], and she should have a repeat echo in 1 month to determine if there has been any recovery in cardiac function with improvement of EF.
# Cardiac tamponade: On the floor post-cath, started to have episodes of hypotension, with blood pressures dropped from 121/58 to 58/38, after using bedpan for a bowel movement.
Bolused with 500 cc's NS x 2 with BP up to the 80's.
Physical exam concerning revealed elevated JVP and crackles on exam.
STAT bedside echo revealed large pericardial effusion causing early tamponade.
The drain output was low over the next day, so this was pulled the following day with no evidence of fluid reaccumulation.
Cause of her tamponade is not entirely clear-- no dye extravasation seen from coronary arteries on repeat cath during pericardiocentesis, however she may have had a small puncture that then clotted off.
# Acute kidney injury:  She was noted to be oliguric on [**7-13**] and her urine sediment showed muddy brown casts consistent with ATN from the setting of hypotension.
Baseline creatinine 0.6-0.8, rose to maximum of 1.7.
Creatinine downtrended to 1.0 on discharge.
# Anemia: no recent baseline, but hct was in 36-39 range in 11/[**2109**].
Received 4 units packed RBCs due to bleeding post-pericardiocentesis (see above) with improvement of hct to 30-36 range.
Her hematocrit then remained stable with no signs of hemolysis.
Hct 34 on discharge.
Should have hct rechecked at next visit with PCP to ensure it has remained stable.
Should have a repeat echo as an outpatient in 1 month to see if she has any improvement in systolic function.
Will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] and his NP [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2110-8-19**] for follow up.
She should have a repeat echo at that time to see if EF has improved.
Should start metoprolol and ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] once blood pressure allows and restart statin once LFTs have normalized - [**Last Name (un) **]:  should have BUN/Cr checked at next PCP visit to ensure renal function has remained normal - Transaminitis:  should recheck LFTs at next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
- Anemia: due to hemolysis (cause unknown) and acute blood loss, should have hct checked at next PCP follow up - FULL CODE (was DNR/DNI while in the CCU, however now wants "to live a little longer")  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from Patient.
Changes to your medications: START aspirin 162mg daily START plavix 75 mg daily STOP diltiazem temporarily, until your blood pressure and kidney function improves STOP lisinopril, temporarily, until your blood pressure and kidney function improves Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
