Cardiac catheterization revealed an aortic valve peak gradient of 80 with estimated valve surface area of 0.5 cm2 and severely elevated filling pressures with prominent V waves.
Cardiac catheterization showed 30% ostial left circumflex lesion with mild left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery luminal irregularities.
Left ventriculogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, 3+ mitral regurgitation and normal wall motion.
The patient underwent scheduled aortic valvuloplasty on day one of this admission, which showed a peak gradient of 60 mm of mercury and a valve area of 0.4 cm2.
After valvuloplasty the gradient was reduced to 30 mm of mercury and the valve surface area increased to 0.6 cm2.
A new left bundle branch block was noted on a post intervention electrocardiogram with a heart rate of 75.
A repeat electrocardiogram after this procedure showed atrial fibrillation without left bundle branch block.
The patient's pulmonary artery pressure was 61/22 with a mean of 40.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on transfer to the Coronary Care Unit, the patient had a pulse of 66, respiratory rate 24, blood pressure 108/49 and oxygen saturation 100% on two liters nasal cannula.
Pulmonary:  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally with bibasilar crackles.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 31.4, creatinine 1, and INR 1.2.
Blood cultures were obtained, a chest x-ray was obtained and the patient was held for a further 24 hours for observation.
She had no further temperature spikes, with blood cultures showing no growth at the time of discharge and a chest x-ray showing mild congestive heart failure.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow up Monday at the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic for an INR check and Coumadin adjustment.
Since she was having bursts of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on her current Lopressor dose, she may need an increase in the dose of this medication.
