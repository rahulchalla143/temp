On arrival, his vital signs were: T98.3, P118, BP200/94, R18, O2sat 92% on room air.
His O2 sat dropped to 83% on room air and he was placed on a non-rebreather-->O2 sats rebounded to the high 90's.
He was found to have elevated pancreatic enzymes and a cxr suggestive of CHF vs. pneumonia.

EKG: Supraventricular tachycardia with atrial rate 230, ventricular rate 116.
Echo [**1-20**] - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20 mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-10-3**], the pulmonary artery systolic pressure is increased.
Creatinine was at approximate baseline on admission, then doubled with minimal urine output likely due to ATN as muddy brown casts observed in sediment; possible compounded by cocaine and NSAID use.
Urine output improving and Cre returned to near baseline in the setting of HD.
An AV fistula was placed by the Transplant surgery team.
Blood cultures were NGTD.
Hct in low-mid 20's since [**2154-1-14**].
Iron studies [**2154-4-9**] showed iron deficiency and iron supplementation was started, which was then discontinued per renal and he was started on erythropoetin.
ECG was without signs of ischemia and cardiac enazymes with elevated trop of 0.17 likely due to renal failure +/- demand from decompensated heart failure.
ECG on presentation with SVT with 2:1 block atrial tachycardia.
