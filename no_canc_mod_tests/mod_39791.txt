He was initially managed at an OSH where he received CT scans of the head, c-spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis which revealed a sternal fracture at the manubrium with associated hematoma, right [**6-24**] rib fractures with pneumothorax, T6-10, T12 vertebral fractures, and subcutaneous air near the neck.
Patient was admitted to TSICU, and blood pressures remained low despite aggressive fluid rescucitation.
A hematoma slightly compressing the left atrium was visualized on ECHO and CTA, deemed to be likely slow venous bleed.
HEENT: Pupils: 1 and MR Resp: Intubated, coarse ventilator sounds, CTA anteriorly, unable to auscultate posteriorly due to precautions for spinal fractures.

Total fluoroscopy time was 81.8 seconds.
[**2198-12-20**] CXR Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no visible pneumothorax.
[**2197-12-23**] : The ET tube tip is 6.5 cm above the carina.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 92275**] was evaluated in our trauma bay with physical survey and imaging showing the following injuries: Sternal fx Mediastinal hematoma Pulmonary contusion R pneumothorax L hemothorax T-spine fx t6-10 & 12  By system:  Neuro: CT of the T-spine showed multiple T-spine fractures (T4,T6-T10,T12), with possible unstable T8 & T10 fractures.
This was followed with an MRI showing spinal cord contusion at T9 but stable ligaments throughout.
Patient's neurologic exam was within normal limits.
A bedside TTE on HD 2 showed a left pleural effusion with poor visulaization of the heart.
A TEE showed potential compression of the left atrium due to the hematoma with a CTA confirming decreased AP diameter due to hematoma as well as rib fractures.
These remained in place, serial radiographs demonstrated resolution and they were dc'd on HD 5 without complication.
His ventilator weans (see below for more information) were also equally challenging with very little respiratory reserve.
A CT scan was obtained on HD 12 to assess further and demonstrated a moderate to large amount of fluid, likely old blood, in his right chest cavity.
It was removed on HD 14 and post-pull CXR demonstrated a pneumothorax, prompting reinsertion of a chest tube on HD 15.
He failed a speech & swallow eval on HD 16 but then passed it on HD 18 at which point he was fitted for a PMV.
Patient had a swallow study on HD 18.
GU: Foley catheter was placed to record urine output.
Bronchoscopy did show secretions and BAL grew staph aureus 10-100K.
