Last [**Month (only) **] he underwent successful PTCA and stenting of his left anterior descending artery.
In addition, he has known severe mitral regurgitation which has been followed by serial echocardiograms which have demonstrated worsening mitral regurgitation and increased pulmonary pressures.
A repeat cardiac catheterization was performed [**2185-4-13**] which showed severe two vessel disease.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
There is a prosthetic valve in the mitral position with no MR and a mean gradient of 3 mmHg.

Initial attempt was made to repair his valve, however a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed systolic anterior motion and an eccentric jet of mitral regurgitation.
His laboratory values revealed acute kidney injury and likely hepatic shock immediately post-operatively, but these values trended toward normalization with time.
CXR will be followed as an outpatient.
