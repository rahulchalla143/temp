Head CT there was reported as negative (images unavailable at this time).
INR was 2.9.
After Vit K, LP showed clear and yellow (xanthochromic) CSF.
CSF showed 0 WBC in tubes 1 & 4, 765 RBC in tube 1 and 790 RBC in tube 4; CSF glucose was 58, CSF Protein 59.
CSF gram stain showed no WBC and no organisms; culture is pending at [**Hospital3 **].
Here, CTA head was preliminarily read as showing no aneurysms (final recons still pending) but showing generalized edema.
MRI was subsequently performed and showed diffuse subdural pachymeningeal enhancement and T2 hyperintensity but no blood on GRE, no edema, no DWI lesions.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
CT Head [**12-1**] 1:13 AM: 1.
Although the differential diagnosis based on CT findings alone would also include chronic subdural hematomas, the recent MRI from [**2108-11-30**] noted no evidence of blood products.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**12-1**]: IMPRESSION: Medullary sponge kidney.
CT Head [**12-1**], 11 pm 1.
Blood with dural patch in the spinal canal from Ll5-S2 levels as described above, encasing the roots and mildly reducing the potential space available in the canal.
If there is continued concern for dural tear, CT Myelogram can be considered.

When this seemed unlikley and his MRI showed bilateral subdural effusions, he was transferred to neurology.
The initial assessment suggested that he likely had an intracranial hypotension and a low-pressure headache aggravated by his recent LP.
He had a lumbar spine MRI which showed changes consistent with his recent LP and blood patch.
He had a CT Abd/pelivs which showed a 4 mm kindey stone in the left ureter.
GI was consulted & an EGD was performed which only showed small hiatal hernia and no source of bleed.
We urged him to follow up with his PCP to have his INR followed and gave him a prescription for bloodwork for INR as soon as possible.
Outpatient Lab Work Blood work for INR as soon as possible.
