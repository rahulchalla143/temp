# fever: etiology of pt's fever was initially felt [**3-4**] pneumonia, however retrocardiac density on CXR was not very impressive, particularly given lack of wbc and lack of findings on CXR.
Urine legionella, sputum, blood, and urine cultures were obtained which were unremarkable.
her acute increase in lethargy was felt most likely [**3-4**] infection versus CHF, although hypercarbia was possible (though beleive pt was not far off of baseline CO2 which is likely 53-55 based on previous serum HCO3 levels).
An ABG was obtained which showed pCO2 60s.
Serum B12, folate, TSH were obtained on admission which were unremarkable.
# hypoxia: pt with h/o OSA, with ?CHF +/- evidence of a component of pulmonary artery hypertension on CXR (increased calibre of pulmonary vasculature).
given her CXR, the sense was that CHF was the predominant etiology.
Cardiac enzymes obtained to evaluate causes for CHF exacerbation which were unremarkable.
cardiac enzymes unremarkable.
TTE obtained to evaluate LVEF showed normal EF, E/A 0.9. normal valves.
# Anemia: last hct at [**Hospital1 18**] was 32.5 in [**5-/2150**] and has now dropped to 24.3.  per report, HCT was been in mid 20s at nursing home.
Guaiac negative in ED, renal function OK.  Iron studies and hemolysis labs obtained which were low normal, and stools guaic performed.
discussed timeline of decline with PCP ([**Doctor Last Name **]), who feels this can be continued to workup as outpatient, where we can monitor her reticulocyte response to iron (retics here prior to iron therap 1.2%).
her lisinopril, aricept, and risperdal were discontinued, though aricept and risperdal may be restarted per PCP.
