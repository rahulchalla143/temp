His prior cardiac catheterization on [**10-21**] showed severe three vessel disease with a 40% left main distal stenosis, 70% LAD stenosis, 60% OM stenosis with diffuse distal in his circumflex and then total occlusion after the first OM and a totally occluded right coronary artery.
His cardiac surgery was planned, and his preoperative echocardiogram on [**10-6**] showed an ejection fraction of approximately 40-45% without any valvular disease.
Of note, no left ventriculogram was shot also at cardiac catheterization due to his renal insufficiency.
His carotid ultrasound also showed that his right internal carotid was occluded with a 40-60% left internal carotid stenosis.
He was also seen with a preoperative evaluation by Physical Therapy and continued to be followed by Psychiatry for some confusion as noted in the previous discharge summary.
Preoperative laboratory work as follows:  On the 29th showed a white count of 14.6, hematocrit 30.8.
PT 13.4, PTT 31.9.
Platelet count 424,000.
INR of 1.2.
BUN 35, creatinine 2.2, glucose 108, sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 105, bicarb 26, anion gap of 9.0, calcium 8.6, phosphate 2.9, magnesium 1.4.
Preoperative EKG on the 23rd showed inferior T-wave changes that were nonspecific.
The patient was in sinus rhythm at the time with a rate of 67.
He had a cardiac index of 2.3.
His white count rose to 30.7 with a hematocrit of 31 postoperatively.
His BUN was 20 and creatinine was 1.8, which was down from his baseline of 2.6.
His Swan was pulled to begin wean of his Neo-Synephrine, which he was at at 0.1 mcg/kg/minute.
Continued his Lasix, and cultures had been sent off.
His creatinine rose slightly to 20, and his white count dropped from the 30s to 18.
He was at 89 in sinus rhythm with a blood pressure of 114/56, increased his saturation to 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
At the time his cultures did not return any significant information.
His white count dropped to 14.5.
His creatinine rose slightly to 2.2.
He had decreased breath sounds at both bases, but otherwise his examination was unremarkable.
His white count remained stable at 13.6.
His creatinine also remained stable at 2.1 with a hematocrit of 29.6.
Patient continued to work with rehab, however, he did drop his blood pressure to the 70s and 80s supine throughout the day on the 4th, and so no ambulation was attempted at that time given the instability of his blood pressure.
He was slightly somnolent when this happened on the 4th at 5:45 p.m., and this happened after he came back from his CT scan.
A blood gas was drawn at that time.
His blood pressure rose, but he was a little bit somnolent.
His Lopressor was decreased pending his blood pressure changes.
White count dropped to 10.7.
He was in sinus rhythm in 80s with blood pressure of 99/54 and a planned MRA in the afternoon.
Patient was back on Neo-Synephrine drip at 1.5 in the unit for blood pressure support.
His examination was otherwise unremarkable.
His creatinine stabilized to 2.0, which is below his baseline.
With no final report from his EEG, the decision made to hold on his MRI given that his confusion cleared for assessment by the Neurology service.
He was satting 99% on room air, using incentive spirometer and coughing and deep breathing.
He had no ectopy and his blood pressure was stable, and his incisions were clean, dry, and intact, and he was transferred back out to the floor on the 8th off all drips.
His examination continued to be unremarkable.
His creatinine rose slightly to 2.9, which was above his baseline.
Remained in sinus rhythm with a blood pressure of 90/62 and a pulse of 85.
Patient had a chest x-ray, results were not back at the time, and they were waiting for the patient's daughter to arrive so they could speak to her.
On postoperative day 11, the [**11-4**], the patient was discharged to home in stable condition with a temperature of 98.4, sinus rhythm at 88, blood pressure 144/77, satting 96% on room air.
His abdominal exam was benign.
Final results for the CT of the head that was performed on [**10-28**] showed no intracranial pathology including no signs of intracranial hemorrhage.
