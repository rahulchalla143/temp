Urine output was ~30cc/hr.
He was seen by toxicology who recommended continued high dose insulin, intralipid gtt needed if hemodynamics worsened, and glucose checks every hour.
CXR showed no evidence of PNA, and Abdominal U/S showed cirrhosis with a patent portal vein and normal kidneys.
Of note, his hct and platelets dropped following aggressive fluid resuscitation, but his hct has remained stable at 29.
He also complained of new rash and pain in L antecubital region; ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT or fluid collection.

Brief Hospital Course: 51 y/o man with Hep C/EtOH cirrhosis, IVDA with history of epidural abscess, and chronic back pain, who presented after suspected calcium channel blocker overdose with bradycardia, hypotension and acute renal failure, transferred from the MICU with improved blood pressure and resolving [**Last Name (un) **].
Calcium channel blocker overdose: In the MICU the patient was treated for presumptive amlodipine overdose since OSH pharmacist identified the pills as such.
In the MICU the patient was treated with levophed for hypotension, and IVF to keep CVP 8-10.
His ionized calcium was monitored and repleted.
His blood pressure remained >100/50 and his heart rate ranged from 70s-90s.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine 5.3 on admission.
Patient's creatinine improved with IVF and was 2.2 when called out of ICU.
Creatinine on discharge was 1.7 and continuing to trend down.
He likely has some mild impaired synthetic function given INR 1.3 and platelets 67.
pH, bicarb, and lactate trended down and remained normal after he was transferred out of the MICU.
Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: During his MICU stay the patient's hct dropped from 38 -> 29 and platelets dropped from 155 -> 72 on day two of admission.
Trended CBC which remained stable thereafter.

You were admitted with low blood pressure and slow heart rate after accidentally taking a large dose of amlodipine, a blood pressure medication.
You were treated in the intensive care unit with medications to support your blood pressure and medications to reverse the bad effects of amlodipine.
