He was evaluated by neurosurgery and found to be a non-operative candidate and the decision was made to keep him in a [**Location (un) 2848**] J c-spine collar at least 6 weeks at which point an MRI will be repeated.
Although a CT angiogram of the chest was negative for PE at the time of admission (pt was 2 weeks postop from a Lt distal femur fracture repair and suspicion of pulmonary embolism as mechanism of presenting chest pain, SOB was highly suspected at time of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]), a CXR on [**11-4**] showed evidence of PE/infarction of the Lt lower lobe.
An IVC filter was placed on [**11-5**] to prevent further PE in a quadriplegic patient with traumatic contraindications for anticoagulation.
Per notes, he gradually regained the ability to move his toes ([**3-2**]), ankles ([**1-30**]), and knees ([**1-2**]), as well as use some grasp function of his hands bilaterally, although his exam waxed and waned.
His ABG at that time on FiO2 of 55% was 7.51/38/56.
In the emergency department, his initial vitals were T 98.4, BP 101/53, HR 72, RR 20, O2 sat 99% (unclear what initial vent settings were on presentation).
On exam, he was alert and oriented x 3, satting 97% on AC 550/16, PEEP 10, Fi02 60%.
Mucous membranes were significantly dry, lung exam with good air movement throughout but diffuse coarse rhonchi.
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, however the ED was concerned about possible patchy infiltrates.
EKG unchanged.
WBC noted to increase from 6 to 11.
Flu swab was sent (?).
Blood cx x 3 sent.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
BP=111/53 HR=68 RR=24 O2= 96% VENT: AC 600/12, PEEP 5, FiO2 60%, RR 12 (overbreathing at 24) .
JVP difficult to assess with [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar.

CHEST CT: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT AB/PELVIS: 1.

His only localizing symptom was hypoxia with subjective difficulty breathing, and a CXR was consistent with volume overload vs possible multifocal infiltrates/pneumonia.
Blood and urine cultures were no growth, urine legionella antigen and influenza DFA were negative.
His Picc line was removed out of concern for a possible line infection, and the tip sent for culture (also no growth to date).
He was treated for HAP with Vancomycin, Cefepime and Levofloxacin for a total 7 day course from [**Date range (1) 81836**], at which point all cultures and micro studies were negative.
Follow-up CXR showed improvement, and patient was not demonstrating signs of respiratory infection.
Other studies including MRI of C, L, T spine, CT ab/pelvis, viral studies including HIV and multiple blood, urine, stool and sputum cx were all negative.
CXR was read as moderate pulmonary edema and interval worsening of his bilateral pleural effusions, but could also possibly be consistent with multifocal infiltrates.
He will likely be able to wean off vent as strength and chest wall mechanics improve over time.
He is scheduled for repeat MRI and neurosurgery follow-up [**2139-1-15**].
