He has a long history of elevated blood pressures and he had deferred his blood pressure pills and he was found to have a significant left arm, face and leg weakness with a left visual field cut and left complete hemisensory loss.
A stat NCHCT showed the presence of a right basal ganglia hemorrhage with interventricular extension.
Initial vital signs were significant for elevated blood pressures to the 190s systolic.
A CTA head/neck was obtained in the ED which did not show any underlying vascular malformation.
An MRI of his C-spine did not show evidence of soft tissue or ligamentous injury, and subsequently his C-collar was discontinued.
Follow up CT scans did not show any hematoma expansion.
Following extubation, the patient's exam was such that he was abulic and mute but would follow simple midline and appendicular commands.
[**Name (NI) **] began spiking fevers and CXR showed evidence of a pneumonia.
Mr. [**Known lastname 101787**] was very awake and alert and his neuro exam was better than his recent baseline.
We repeated a head CT to ensure no acute findings.
This repeat CT showed only the evolution of the hemorrhage but no other findings of concern.
