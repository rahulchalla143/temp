This was originally thought to be cardiac ischemia and the patient was taken to cardiac catheterization and found to have patent vein grafts.
Laboratory studies then revealed that the patient had pancreatitis with an amylase of approximately 3300.
Sputum grew out Serratia which was sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Her liver function tests, amylase and lipase decreased to normal and the patient improved clinically an was extubated on [**2133-6-9**] and transferred that day to the general wards.
Miconazole cream 5.
PHYSICAL EXAM AT TRANSFER TO THE GENERAL FLOOR: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.8?????
?, pulse 90, blood pressure 169/84, respiratory rate 20s, pulse oximetry 98% to 99% on a shelf mask.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Dry oral mucosa, no oral lesions.
Breath sounds were decreased at the bases bilaterally.
IMAGING AND LABORATORY STUDIES ON [**2133-6-10**]:  White blood count 20.1, hematocrit 32.6, platelets 636.
INR 1.2, sodium 145, potassium 3.3, chloride 106, bicarbonate 26, BUN 32, creatinine 0.6, glucose 136.
The patient had a prior echocardiogram which showed a normal ejection fraction of 61% with posterobasal wall motion abnormalities, normal filling pressures on cardiac catheterization of [**2133-5-28**].
In addition to sputum culture on [**2133-6-6**] revealing Serratia sensitive to ceftriaxone, urine cultures on [**2133-6-8**] revealed greater than 100,000 organisms per ml of yeast.
Sputum cultures were positive for Serratia, sensitive to ceftriaxone for which the patient received a 14 day course of antibiotics.
CT of the sinuses did reveal some paranasal sinus thickening and partial opacification of the mastoid air cells.
Her amylase and liver function tests had essentially returned to baseline.
As she was unable to take po's, she relied on intravenous Lopressor and hydralazine for blood pressure control.
She underwent a cardiac catheterization when she was admitted thinking that her symptoms were related to cardiac ischemia.
This study revealed patent grafts.
She failed a swallowing study upon her return to the floor and was continued on TPN for several days.
A repeat swallowing study on [**2133-6-15**] revealed good tolerance of po's.
Pancreatitis 4.
