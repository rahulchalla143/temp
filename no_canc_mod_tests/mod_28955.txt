CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2189-3-29**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Bilateral renal lesions, the larger are consistent with cysts, several subcentimeter lesions are too small to characterize.
Further evaluation with ultrasound or MRI is recommended.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2189-3-31**] Conclusions: Technically suboptimal study.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2189-4-3**] Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% to 40% (nl >=55%) The left atrium is elongated.
Overall, the function and wall motion does not appear appreciably changed from the previous (limited) transthoracic study of [**2189-3-31**].
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
Wedge fracture of a single mid thoracic vertebral body.
Tranesophagel echocardiogram [**2189-4-4**] Conclusions: Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-3-31**], the right ventricular function is similar.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2189-4-15**]   *** Not Signed Out ***  BRIEF HISTORY:   73 year old male with coronary artery disease status post two remote myocardial infarction who presented with a hip fracture and NSTEMI.
Echocardiogram revealed an LVEF of 35% with wall motion abnormalities consistent with rPDA and mid-LAD disease.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections using a 5 French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast injections.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.

The patient's hematocrit was maintained >28 with blood transfusions as needed.
Once in the CCU, his phenylephrine was discontinued and he was started on peripheral dopamine for blood pressure support.
The Swan numbers showed elevated right-sided pressures and a narrow pulse pressure which was concerning for PE.
He was started on a heparin gtt, electively intubated, and underwent a CT angiography which showed no evidence of PE as above.
After hemodynamic stability, the patient was extubated without difficulty.
The patient completed a 7-day course of Zosyn and a 14-day course of vancomycin started [**2189-4-4**] for MRSA in the sputum and [**2-12**] blood cultures with S. faecium.
The patient's cardiac enzymes were stable and ischemia was not believed to be responsible for the patient's arrhythmia.
The patient was restarted on coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and should receive INR checks regularly at least twice weekly until stable to ensure that INR is at goal [**3-14**].
He should have follow-up imaging to reassess the probable renal cysts seen on CT abdomen as above.
The patient should have further management of COPD diagnosed on chest X-ray as needed.
Congestive heart failure, EF 30-40% .
Pacer placed post-MI for complete heart block, replaced x2 most recently [**2-/2188**] 2.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease per CXR 7.
INR 2.5.
- For your heart, you should take: -- Aspirin 325 mg once daily -- Plavix 75 mg once daily -- Metoprolol 25 mg twice daily -- Lisinopril 5 mg once daily -- Simvastatin  40 mg once daily -- Warfarin 3 mg once daily -- Please have INR checked every two to three days at rehab with goal INR [**3-14**] until stable values obtained .
