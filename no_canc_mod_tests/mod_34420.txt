Preoperative assessment.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Postbypass  The post bypass exam was performed while the patient was receiving 0.03 mcg/kg/min of epinephrine, 0.25 mcg/kg/min of milrinone, 1.5 mcg/kg/min of phenylephrine.
She remained in the intensive care unit on milirone which was weaned off post operative day 2 but remained in neosynephrine to augment her blood pressure.
On post operative day three she was pan cultured for elevated white blood cell count and the blood culture [**12-23**] bottles were positive for staph coag negative from aline, vancomycin was started, ID consulted, and repeat blood cultures obtained.
She remained in the intensive care unit to monitor her rhythm until POD# 7 when her rhythm showed stable recovery  and EP determined that a PPM was not warranted at this time and low dose Beta-Blocker could be used if necessary to rate control her atrial fibrillation.
She was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Vancomycin was continued for a 7 day course as per ID, to cover for blood culture believed to be a contaminant.
INR goal for Afib is [**12-22**] 2.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: dose will change daily for goal INR [**12-22**], [**First Name (STitle) **] to manage.
