In the ED, the patient's initial VS were T 98.6, BP 162/106, P 111, R 24-30, O2 83% on 5L (she normally wears 5L at home).
She had diffuse expiratory wheezes on physical exam but no peripheral edema.
CXR showed cardiomegaly, and EKG did not show evidence of ST-T wave abnormalities.
She was then started on a heparin gtt at 1200U/h for possible PE, given the fact that she was likely over the weight limit for the CT scanner.
She was then admitted to the MICU for further workup and evaluation.
At the time of transfer, her VS were BP 142/79, P 85, R 18, O2 97% on BiPAP.
Past Medical History: Morbid obesity Obstructive sleep apnea Reactive airway disease (COPD vs. Asthma) on 4L home O2 - no PFTs available for review Presumed PE in '[**12**] Pulmonary Hypertension ?
