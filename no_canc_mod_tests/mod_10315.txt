A chest xray was performed and was consistent with left-sided chest tube remains in unchanged position terminating in the apical area.
The hyponatremia resolving and the serum sodium was 140.
CT scan showed increased left subdural hematoma with early subfalcine herniation.
Post-operative CT showed post operative changes with pneumocephalus.
Screening lenies were performed and were negative.
On [**12-25**], Repeat CT demonstrated persistent cerebral edema with unchanged 5mm midline shift.
Post pull x-rays showed showed no PTX.
In the afternoon, she became less arousable and a head CT was ordered.
Her serum Na was 139 and she was started on NaCl tabs for goal Na greater than 140.
A CT scan showed slight increase in subdural fluid collection and mass effect.
A repeat ultrasound of the groin showed interval increase in size of the right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm to 2.3cm.
