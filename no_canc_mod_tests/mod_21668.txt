Coli bacteremia/UTI, peri-rectal abscess/enterococcal wound infection.
The patient was being treated with Gent/Levo/Flagyl (Day 4 treatment, day 1 post-op) when she developed SBP of 67, but was asymptomatic.
Given the patient's positive blood cultures and perirectal abscess, the most likely source is E. coli bacteremia, which was ultimately found to be resistant to quinolones.
ID was consulted and given quinolone resistance, the patient was placed on aztreonam/metronidazole/vancomycin with improvement in vital signs and negative surveillence cultures.
Once blood pressure was stable for a few days, she was re-started on half her home dose of lisinopril.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative for any new ischemia contributing to the hypotension.
A TTE was performed that demonstrated LVEF of 60% and minimal AV stenosis.
Patient had a [**Last Name (un) 104**] stym test that showed no adrenal insufficiency.
Of note, the patient at baseline is reported to have SBP that ranges from 90-100's.
The patient on the day of discharge has a SBP of 93/33, mentating well with good urine output.
On the day of discharge the patient was noted to have an INR of 2.7.
The patient previously was taking coumadin 1mg po qd, but developed an INR to 6.0, although in the setting of abx therapy.
the patient's INR will need to be carefully monitored and adjusted as needed.
DP pulses were intact, the patient's foot was warm and distal movement/sensation was intact.
Echo demonstrated preserved LVEF (60%).
Anemia: HCT was 25 post-op from baseline 29-31.
After transfusion of 2u PRBC, hct was stable.
Iron studies and B12 were normal.
Patient was guaiac negative throughout stay.
Yeast in the urine: Yeast was seen on urine cx.
