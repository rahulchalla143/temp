The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Hemodynamics demonstrate a low cardiac output with elevated biventricular filling pressures.
Final angiogram showed 0% residual stenosis in the stent, no dissection and normal flow.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
His CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema, but also had multifocal infiltrates.
His ACE-i was held until his creatinine returned to baseline and he was discharged home on 5 mg Lisinopril.
Due to the apical akinesis on his ECHO he was started on anti-coagulation with Warfarin.
His plan was to have his PCP follow his INR, and have a repeat echo in 6 weeks to 3 months to evaluate his cardiac function.
# HTN: After diuresis he was noted to have systolic blood pressures in the 130's-140's with diastolic blood pressures in the 90's.
If his echo continues to show a depressed EF he will need to start spironolactone as an outpatient.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: He had a mild bump in his CR while he was hospitalized and diuresed prior to discharge his Cr was 1.1. .
