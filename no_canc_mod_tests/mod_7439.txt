MR brain [**2157-2-25**]: There is a 1.3 cm cystic lesion in the 4th ventricle causing obstructing hydrocephalus.
These findings in combination with the bilateral calcification seen on CT are highly suspicious for neurocysticercosis.
Because of the high degree of obstructive hydrocephalus, lumbar puncture is contraindicated.
MR spine (C-,T-, and L-spine) [**2157-2-28**]: IMPRESSION:  1.
Shunt series [**2157-2-28**]: Views from the skull to the upper abdomen shows placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt that extends to the upper abdomen with the tube curled somewhat on itself so that the tip then goes to the mid portion of the abdomen on the right  CT abdomen2/5/12: No abnormality seen along the course of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
The tip of it is seen in the inferior right perihepatic region  NCHCT [**2157-3-7**]: 1.
Imaging revealed a large cyst in the 4th ventricle causing obstructive hydrocephalus.
The shunt was checked post-operative day 3 with a shunt series and was intact.
Also checked was a total spine MRI and ophthamologic exam for other cystircercosis.
However, due to continued pain, a CT abdomen was performed and showed the shunt lying in the right perihepatic region.
