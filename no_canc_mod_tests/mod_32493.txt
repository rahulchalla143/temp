He had a CT head done which showed a small 5mm left parietal subdural hematoma, INR 3.1 and was given Vit K and 2u FFP.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Repeat CT Head today showed stable SDH.
On exam on MICU admission, patient was alert and oriented.
Nicardipine gtt was titrated off at the time of my examination with SBP in 150s.

CT Head W/O Contrast ([**2127-9-29**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Ultrasound RUE ([**2127-10-2**]): IMPRESSION: Somewhat technically limited study, but no deep vein thrombosis seen in the right arm.
Recommend further evaluation with CT scan of the hip to exclude an underlying fracture.
Pelvic CT W/O Contrast ([**2127-10-6**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Further evaluation could be achieved with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] when appropriate.
The patient's SDH was found to be stable on repeat CT scan the day following admission.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an INR of 3.1 at presentation, anticoagulated on coumadin, which was reversed with 1 unit FFP and 10 mg of Vitamin K.  Neurologic exam was unremarkable and stable throughout hospital stay.
Per Neurosurgery recommendations, he will remain off his Coumadin for 4 weeks and will follow-up in [**Hospital 4695**] clinic for repeat CT scan to assess for resolution of his bleed.
His blood pressure finally came down treated w/ Nicardipine and -3.5L HD.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.
His metoprolol was uptitrated, and diltiazam 30 TID was added due to persistent elevation of BPs.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient's blood pressure was periodically elevated in the SBPs 180s.
His electrolytes and renal function were otherwise at baseline throughout his hospital stay.
On [**2127-10-2**], in the MICU, the patient was found to be drowsy with a blood sugar of 47.
He continued on this sliding scale with fair control of blood glucose levels (<200).
A RUE ultrasound showed no thrombi and the RUE continued to have strong pulses.
The patient's hip was imaged with a left pelvic xray which showed degenerative changes of the hip bilaterally as well as lucency in the left femoral neck, but low suspicion of fracture.
A left pelvic CT w/o contrast was then performed which demonstrated a "Large lucent lesion of the left femoral head with a scalloped contour suggests the possibility of a joint-based process, possibly bilateral given the slightly abnormal contour of the inferior right femoral head.
You also underwent several studies for left hip pain.
