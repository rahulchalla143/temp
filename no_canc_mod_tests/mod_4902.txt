Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-5-13**], sinus rhythm is absent.
Morphology of the paced QRS complex is different in leads V1-V2, with now upright R waves rather than RS complex - question markedly different electrode placement versus interval change in location of the ventricular pacing lead.
CXR [**2115-6-20**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
CT C-Spine: [**2115-6-20**] 1.
In the setting of canal narrowing, correlation with clinical symptoms is recommended and cervical spine MR can be obtained if cord injury is suspected  CT Head [**2115-6-20**] Preliminary Report !!
X-Ray Pelvis [**2115-6-20**] No fracture or malalignment.
CT Angiography [**2115-6-21**]: No pulmonary embolism  Nodular consolidation in the middle lobe.
Followup CT is recommended in 3 months to look for its resolution and ensure that its consolidation.
RUQ US [**2115-6-22**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**2115-6-25**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %) with akinesis of the mid to apical septum, lateral hypokinesis/akinesis, apical akinesis, and anterior hypokinesis/akinesis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-5-14**], mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are now more prmoinent.
Right ventricular systolic function appears similar.
CT SCAN Abdomen and Pelvis with Contrast [**2115-7-9**]: The lung bases are notable for a large right and moderate left pleural effusion, with expected overlying atelectasis.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, prostate, seminal vesicles, rectum and colon are normal.
Distended gallbladder, which may be the result of the fasting state in the appropriate setting.
Slight wall thickening could be explained by fluid overload (also suggesting by other findings) but if there are any acute symptoms which may related to gallbladder pathology, ultrasound could be given consideration.
Troponins were trended and flat at 0.03.
CT angio [**2115-6-21**] ruled out Pulmonary embolism.
On the early morning of the [**6-23**], 3rd hospital day, the patient was found to have hemodynamicaly unstable atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with SBP in the 80s and HR in the 140s.
On morning of [**2115-6-25**], HD 5, patient with continued dyspnea, with saturations of 94% on 2L NC, positive pulsus paradoxus of 14mmHg.
Stat echo did not show pericardial effusion, but did demonstrate increased TR, MR, Pulmonary arterial HTN and Low EF (was 15% on [**4-27**]).
Stat CXR showed increasing right plural effusion/ pulmonary edema.
Surgery was consulted who recommended keeping the patient NPO until at least [**7-14**] with potential repeat PEG placement at that time pending goals of care and repeat swallow eval.
Per his friends/HCP - this is his baseline status.
#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH INR OF 1.5 EVOLVING INTO AFIB WITH RVR DURING HOSPITALIZATION:  Patient was admitted in atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
Followup CT is recommended in 3 months to look for its resolution and ensure that its consolidation ([**9-27**]).
He is discharged on TPN and needs repeat swallow eval after [**7-14**].

Weight at discharge: 180.6lbs   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**].
We looked for concerning causes of loss of consciousness including a pulmonary embolism, as well as interrogating your pacemaker for an episode of unstable heart rates, but the studies were negative.
Please weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
Followup Instructions: Repeat speech and swallow evaluation in 1 week's time.
