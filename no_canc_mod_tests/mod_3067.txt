CXR showed cardiomegaly and an ECHO revealed a large pericardial effusion as well as intramural hematoma in aorta.
Emergent CTA of the chest showed a likely type A aortic dissection.
Of note, patient's initial INR was elevated at 1.8 and PTT was elevated at 45 which was of unclear etiology, thought potentially due to loss of bowel flora.
CXR showed L pleural effusion and loculated fluid in the L fissure.
CT and LP were both negative.
WBC continued to be elevated and low grade fever persisted.
All blood and stool cultures have been negative.
RPR was negative.
Likely hypopituitary but not panhypopit b/c FSH/LH levels were normal.
An U/S was ordered and found a thrombus occluding L IJ and a thrombus in the R cephalic vein.
Continued to be CVP10 PA27/17, thermodilution CI 1.8, SVO2 61.

On CXR she was found to have large pericardial effusion, confirmed by echo.
Rheumatology and infectious disease were both consulted to help in the evaluation of this finding.
MRA showed thickening and inflammation of the ascending and descending aorta as well as SMA.
Hypercoagulable w/u showed one positive lupus anticoagulant so pt may have antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
She was seen by [**Doctor First Name 1978**] who was felt further repeat Ab testing would need to be done as outpt to diagnose APS.
