ECG ([**11-14**]): sinus.
LVH with isolated STE V3 and TWI V5-6, not significantly changed from prior.
CXR, 2-view ([**11-17**]):Compared with [**2173-11-15**], post-extubation with partial interval clearing of the CHF and effusions.
RUQ ultrasound ([**11-19**]): 1.
Cath ([**11-16**]): COMMENTS: 1.
The right sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 12mmHg and RVEDP was 14mmHg).
The left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (mean PCW pressure was 12mmHg).
The systemic arterial pressure was mildly elevated measuring 142/76mmHg.
The cardiac index was within normal range measuring 2.8l/min/m2.
Selective renal aniography demonstrated no renal artery stenosis.
CT head ([**11-20**]): Significantly motion limited study.
Allowing for these limitations, no obvious intracranial hemorrhage or large major vascular territorial infarction, though if suspicion remains high for the latter, MRI would be more sensitive to assess.
MRA of the neck and circle [**Location (un) 431**] are significantly degraded by motion.
CTA head and neck ([**11-22**]): 1.
CTA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] is otherwise unremarkable.
Prior studies - .
ETT ([**8-/2165**]): [**Doctor First Name **] 4.5 min.
will need long-term outpatient titration of BP meds.
cath revealed CAD but no intervention performed.
prior excercise test stopped due to hypertension.
ROMI with cardiac biomarkers negative x 3. discharge on ASA/statin/BB/ACEi.
MRI/MRA brain suggests acute CVA, likely watershed from hypotensive episode per neurology consult however radiology suggests more consistent with embolic.
iron studies c/w ACD.
retic count 4.9. no evidence active bleeding.
Hct low but stable @ 27-29.
Hct goal >27.
will need Hct check at rehab on Friday [**2173-11-26**] and PCP f/u to discuss colonoscopy and further work-up for anemia.
