He was urgently intubated to perform CT scans of the chest and abdomen.
CT scan showed a 6.7x6.5 infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with no suggestion of acute leakage or bleed and bibasilar atelectasis vs airway disease.
ECG showed ST depression in V2 & V3 and prominent T-waves diffusely, RBBB, 1st degree AV block.
His cultures were reportedly unremarkable.
He was evaluated by surgery for the newly discovered abdominal aortic aneurysm, which he was recommened to have endovascular repair.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization and management of AAA repair evaluation.

TTE [**5-25**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
CXR [**5-25**]: Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged.
CTA [**5-29**]: IMPRESSION:  1.
Imaging surveillance is recommended if other intervention is not performed.
2.0 x0.8 cm cystic lesion within the tail of the pancreas, with a second in the pancreatic head which should be further evaluated with MRI on a non-emergent basis, which will also evaluate the renal lesions.
OSH workup: DATE: Echocardiogram done [**2134-5-18**]: This was a technically difficult study.
Left ventricular systolic function was normal and there were no obvious wall motion abnormalities.
Persantine Myoview stress test [**2134-5-17**]: The test was negative for symptoms and EKG changes.
The Myoview perfusion scan showed a moderate sized perfusion defect in the inferior and infra-apical walls.
Cardiac catheterization [**2134-5-18**]: There was severe coronary artery disease with obstruction of the left main coronary artery.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yom who presented to OSH with epigastric pain, shortness of breath, cough and chills, s/p fall on his right chest with ecchymosis, at OSH found to have elevated trop and BNP, fever, leukocytosis, CHF with EF of 25%, and AAA (6.7x6.5 cm), was treated with broad spectrum abx and diureses and transfered here for consideration of surgical intervention for AAA.
His blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.
Had modest trop levels to 0.13 in the setting of CHF exacerbation , echo here showed focal LV wall hypokinesis consistent with CAD , these findings are unchanged from those on MIBI in [**2134**] which showed akinesia and severe perfusion defects in LAD territory.
# CHF:  echo here: mild symmetric LVH, LV is top normal/borderline dilated,  mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid-distal anterior wall, apex, and distal anterior septum (LVEF 35-40%).
LOS fluid balance at tramsfer was -1600 -  holding home lasix, goal I/O even for now - restarted Acei once renal function improved - restarted home carvedilol - salt restrict to Na 2g/daily On Discharge: Continue to monitor I&Os - goal net- even daily.
Monitor Creatinine if restarting home lasix.
Also on phys exam susp politeal aneurysms.
# HTN: Blood pressures currently holding well - Continued lisinopril as above - restarted home carvedilol on half home dose 6.25 On DISCHAREG:- Hold anti-hypertensives if SBP <100 .
# Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia - Continued Proscar - Foley ON DISCHARGE: Trial of Void in 2 days.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: #Pancreas Lesions - on CTA [**5-29**] -  2.0 x 0.8 cm cystic lesion within the tail of the pancreas, with a second in the pancreatic head which should be further evaluated with MRI on a non-emergent basis, which will also evaluate the renal lesions.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 4542**] Rehabilitation and Nursing of [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: 1)COPD exacerbation 2)Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Secondary Diagnosis: - CABG: emergency procedure at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2123**]) - Obstructive Sleep Apnea not on CPAP - Asthma - Asbestosis - Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
START Sodium-chloride Nasal Spray - twice a day as needed START Ipratropium-bromide Nebulizer treatments every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath.
