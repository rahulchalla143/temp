She was taken to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where a head CT revealed a cerebellar hemorrhage.
Vitals in the ED were [**Telephone/Fax (2) 96258**]% on RA.
Her INR was 3.3.
Her neurologic exam has remained stable and, as of this morning, was noted to have some confusion, left sided dysmetria, left lateral gaze palsy (left eye did not move past midline, right eye unable to fully adduct).

IMAGING CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2128-12-18**] 5:59 PM FINDINGS: There is interval development of a large left cerebellar intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
CT [**12-18**]: Large left cerebellar intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2128-12-19**] 10:26 AM FINDINGS: Again seen is a large left cerebellar hemorrhage which extends into the fourth ventricle, and is essentially unchanged compared to one day earlier.
Please note the study is limited due to patient motion artifact.
A head CT showed a large L cerebellar acute hemorrhage, with blood in the 4th ventricle, and mild mass effect on pons.
Her INR was upon admission was 3.3 and she was given Factor IX concentrate in ED, as well as Vit K. The etiology of her hemorrhage is likely to be due to hypertension though hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke, unwitnessed trauma, bleed into underlying mass, or amyloid (usually cortically based) are also possible.
A follow up CT [**12-19**] showed a stable picture.
Her exam improved.
INR 1.2 on [**12-21**].
Endo: The patient's blood sugars were regulated with a ISS based on FSBS.
If her heart rate continues to be above 90, lopressor may be increased.
If her heart rate is well controled (<80) and her blood pressure remains elevated (>140), lisinopril should be increased.
Supportive O2 was given to keep her sO2 >94%.
An ECHO showed a dilated LA, LVEF 55%, mild MR and pulmonary hypertension.
FEN: -Please continue to monitor her i/o's closely and diurese as needed.
Lisinopril 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): please titrate up if heart rate is well controled, but blood pressure continues to stay >140.
Diltiazem HCl 60 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QID (4 times a day): please titrate down if heart rate allows.
