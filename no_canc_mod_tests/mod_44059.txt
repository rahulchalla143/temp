IMAGING: CXR [**2132-12-12**]: IMPRESSION: Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to trace pleural effusion.
Streaky left base retrocardiac opacity most likely relates to atelectasis/scarring and was also seen on the prior study .
ECHO [**2132-12-13**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CTA [**2132-12-14**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, slightly increased from the prior CT of [**2132-10-8**].
