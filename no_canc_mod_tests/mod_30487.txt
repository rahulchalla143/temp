SBP 120 with P 60-80 in ED.
Hct noted to be 18.9 from baseline 33.
SBP did decline, at one point, to 100--this was responsive to fluids with SBP to 120.
Underwent upper endoscopy which visualized minimal oozing and no blood.
History of esophageal varices seen on EGD ([**2115**]), though most recent EGD ([**1-29**]) showed gastropathy and duodenitis, no varices.
Patient reports that biopsy showed fibrosis/cirrhosis.
Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.

EGD: [**2121-12-2**] Impression: Varices at the fundus Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: 1) Continue octreotide and antibiotics 2) Prep for colonoscopy tomorrow 3) If no bleeding source on colonoscopy, may need TIPS .
Colonoscopy [**2121-12-3**] Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum .

Apparent interval development of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.Formal Chest CT recommended 4.

RUQ doppler [**12-4**] IMPRESSION:  Echogenic liver without focal lesion.
Hospital Course by Problem:  GI Bleed: Pt was admitted to the MICU with a hct of 18, and was transfused a total of 3 units PRBCs.
His HCt was initially checked TID, then [**Hospital1 **], and eventually daily.
The Hct continued to be stable for the rest of the hospitalization.
He had a colonoscopy to rule out any colonic sources of bleed.
You had an upper endoscopy and a colonscopy, and the most likely cause of the repeat episodes of anemia are the varicies around your esophagus.
