She was seen by her primary care physician that day who sent her to [**Hospital1 69**] for an abdominal CT scan which was read as negative.
The patient was admitted for work-up of right upper quadrant pain and pain control.
LABORATORY:  On admission, the patient had a white blood cell count of 6.5, hematocrit of 41.6 with an MCV of 89 and platelets of 207.
Sodium was 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 15, creatinine 1.2, glucose of 84.
She had an AST of 32, ALT of 35, amylase of 93, lipase 49.
Total bilirubin of 0.6, and alkaline phosphatase of 89.
On admission, a chest x-ray revealed surgical clips in the right upper quadrant with no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
She also had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed a dilated common bile duct at 7 to 8 millimeters; no intrahepatic ductal dilatation; no obvious stone.
CT scan findings from [**9-28**] showed no acute appendicitis or pancreatitis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, the patient had a temperature of 98.6 F.; blood pressure of 120/80; heart rate of 74; respiratory rate of 18 and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart examination was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops and a normal S1 and S2.
Tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant; negative [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service for further evaluation of her right upper quadrant abdominal pain.
Given the normal findings on right upper quadrant ultrasound and abdominal CT scan, an MRCP was performed which showed two small cysts in the tail of the pancreas, a prominent common bile duct, most likely status post cholecystectomy with no evidence of common bile duct sludge and no evidence of choledocholithiasis.
The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on Tuesday, [**10-3**]; mild biliary dilatation consistent with previous cholecystectomy.
On examination she was found to be unresponsive to voice with her pupils equal, round and reactive to light with no vestibular ocular reflex.
Her tone was decreased in all four extremities.
Reflexes were one plus and symmetrical with downgoing toes bilaterally.
In summary, the Neurology consultation felt that the patient was slow to recover following sedation for the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and thought that there was a possibility of seizure activity, but that she was recovering from the sedation.
They recommended an EEG the next day, which was normal and showed no evidence of seizure activity.
When the patient was taken down the next morning to have this study done, scout films revealed that her transverse and descending colon were full of contrast from the prior CT scan, therefore, we were unable to complete the upper gastrointestinal small bowel follow through.
The patient was seen by Infectious Disease who reviewed the biopsy results done by her dermatologist.
All of her imaging studies were within normal limits with no obvious etiology for abdominal pain.
Her AST and ALT were elevated after her endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography but were trending down, and she was able to tolerate liquids without any problem.
