STUDIES: ========= EKG [**2159-12-3**] Baseline artifact Sinus tachycardia Q-Tc interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2159-2-10**], sinus tachycardia now present but otherwise baseline artifact on both tracing makes comparison difficult .
LINE PLACEMENT  [**2159-12-6**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2158-4-27**], there is no change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
