TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial and MP-RAGE sagittal images acquired following gadolinium.
Comparison was made with the previous study of [**2097-7-28**].
Following gadolinium no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement seen.
FS at OSH was 126.
CT head negative for acute process.
MRI was normal.
EKG unchanged and CE negative x1 so less likely primary cardiac event.
LFTs, lipase, with the exception that alk phos was 131, and amylase was 148.
His HSV PCR returned the day following discharge as "detected."
Last CD4 count 394 and VL <48 in [**2-5**].
ATRIPLA [**Telephone/Fax (3) 567**] mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
The tests performed did not show any infection that could have caused your problems.
