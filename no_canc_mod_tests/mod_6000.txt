He had had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing mild gastritis and esophagitis and then he was discharged on [**2135-2-15**].
In the Emergency Department he was found to have glucose greater than 500, anion gap of 20 and a bicarbonate of 80.
He also had an EKG with sinus tachycardia at 102, normal axis, ST depression in the lateral leads which resolved with treating his tachycardia.
His troponin peaked at 7 at 1 PM on the 27th.
His last catheterization in [**2127**] revealed proximal left anterior descending coronary artery 30-40% stenosis, diffuse 50% right coronary artery, left circumflex coronary artery clean, D1 30-40%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer from the medical intensive care unit to the floor his heart rate was 70-75, blood pressure 174/83, breathing at 12, 90% on room air, weight 84 kg.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation except for minor crackles at the bases.
Extremities:  He had [**1-23**] dorsalis pedis pulses, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
The patient had an ECG on the [**2-16**] showing sinus tachycardia at 102, normal axis, ST depressions in 1, 2, V5 to V5.
We also repeated the EKG when the patient was experiencing nausea and vomiting to make sure this wasn't an anginal equivalent and the patient similarly had a normal sinus rhythm with normal axis and no EKG changes, peaked Q's or T wave inversions.
LABORATORY DATA:  On the day of admission the patient's hematocrit was 41.9, hemoglobin 13.7.
On the day of discharge hemoglobin was 13.1, hematocrit 37.9.
White count was 9.9 on the day of admission, 7 on the day of discharge.
Platelet count was 180.
Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase, negative for nitrite, negative for white blood cells and no bacteria.
At presentation his chem-7 was glucose 431, urea 33, creatinine 1.2, sodium 143, potassium 4.7, chloride 111, total bicarbonate 6 and anion gap of 26.
On the day of discharge sodium was 136, urea 13, creatinine 0.9, chloride 97, bicarbonate 29, potassium 4.1.
On the 26th, on the day of admission the patient had a chest x-ray.
Heart size was slightly enlarged, no evidence of congestive heart failure, flattening of diaphragms consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, minimal bibasilar atelectasis, no pulmonary consolidation or pleural effusion.
He was treated for the diabetic ketoacidosis in the medical intensive care unit and soon after ruled in with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with peak troponin of 7.
CK was never higher than 80s.
The patient's metoprolol was 25 b.i.d.
Heart rate was in the low 70s.
Cholesterol panel was checked with triglycerides 124, HDL 38, LDL 65, cholesterol:HDL ratio of 3.4.
The patient is to have a stress test on Thursday, [**2-24**] as an outpatient.
The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] early the following week after the stress test or earlier if there is an abnormal result.
Congestive heart failure:  No evidence on examination throughout his whole stay despite vigorous hydration for diabetic ketoacidosis.
Creatinine was stable.
Random level was 83.
The covering attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1726**], was to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding this matter and see if the patient would need a follow-up emptying study at a future date.
Hematology:  Hematocrit was stable.
He was guaiac positive, possibly reflecting his old gastritis, but his hematocrit and hemoglobin were very stable during the hospital course.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to have a stress test on Thursday, [**2-24**]; an ETT MIBI, and this has been scheduled.
