He recently presented back to an outside hospital with room air, oxygen saturations of 80% and had chest x-ray consistent with pulmonary edema, intubated and received Lasix 40 times one and another 80 times two upon transfer to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.
History of coronary artery disease, P-MIBI in [**2127**] showed large inferior reversible defect.
Echocardiogram in [**2129-9-12**] showed left atrial mildly dilated left wall thickness, normal ejection fraction of 40 to 50%, secondary to severe hypokinesis, inferior free wall and moderate hypokinesis of posterior wall, mild to 1+ mitral regurgitation.
; NPH 26 in AM, 8 in PM; Tylenol prn  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed temperature 102.0, heartrate 92, blood pressure 135/55, respiratory rate 11.
His ventilator settings were SIMV with pressure support, title volume of 800, rate 10, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 and FIO2 60%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Intubated, moist membrane mucosal, pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed white blood count 12.8, hemoglobin and hematocrit 11 and 33.3, platelets 462, MCV 90, sodium 142, potassium 4.9, chloride 106, bicarbonate 24, BUN 61, creatinine 2.8, glucose 105.

Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and no major changes noted.
Cardiac - Coronaries, cycled enzymes were negative and he was ruled out.

Blood pressure - He is normal sinus rhythm, he has history of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
He had a temperature of 102 but has not had one since.
His baseline creatinine is about mid 2s to .5, now he is bumped up to 4s and this is most likely secondary to Lasix, possibly decreased volume to his kidneys.
Will continue to follow his creatinine closely.
