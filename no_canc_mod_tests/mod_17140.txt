Her SBP then decreased to the low 90s, and she was started on aspirin, heparin gtt, dopamine and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, SBP in the low 90s with HR 130s on dopamine 10 mcg/kg/min.
Troponin-T here was 1.51, CK 368, CKMB 45.
Creatine was 1.8, from baseline 1.3.
On arrival to the CCU, patient was chest pain-free, conversant.
SBP 90s, HR 130s, sating well on room air.
Of note, patient was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital 5871**] hospital from [**2133-1-27**] to [**2133-1-31**] for heart failure with BNP 2657.
Her echo at that time reportedly showed EF 45-50%.

Echo [**2133-2-11**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with global hypokinesis and inferior/infero-lateral akinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-12-14**], overall LVEF has decreased.
Several minutes later returned to asystole, was given epi 1mg x 1 and had brief compressions, returned to tachycardia rhythm.
EKG significant for new LBBB.
CK was trended and peaked at 792. .
Echocardiogram showed EF 20% with moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
