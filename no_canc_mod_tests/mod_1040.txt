Patient reports subsquent improvement in symptoms, and was seen by his PCP [**2163-12-22**], who ruled him out for a PE with a CT contrast given his persistant tachycardia, and performed a TTE [**2163-12-23**] that showed small circumferential pericardial effusion with slight right ventricular diastolic invagination c/w increased pericardial pressure.
Patient was [**Last Name (LF) 7319**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] plan was to repeat TTE in 1wk to observe for change.
On initial presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] initial vital signs were 77 103/62 20 98%RA.
Exam was significant for clear lung fields, elevated JVD.
A bedside ultrasound performed by the ED staff reportedly demonstrated moderate-large pericardial effusion.
Labs were significant for WBC 11.5 (N80%), Hct 31.5 (39.7 at discharge), platelets 554 (from 354), Cr 0.9.
Official echo demonstrated enlarged pericardial effusion, RV cavity appearing smaller but without collapse, suggestive of impending (early) tamponade.
Patient was transferred to cath lab for urgent pericardiocentesis which was performed with opening pressure 24 mmHg, 320 cc bloody fluid taken off with resolution of symptoms and return of normal hemodynamics.

TTE [**12-25**]: The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-12-25**], the pericardail effusion is [**Last Name (un) 7322**] smaller (now post pericardiocentesis) without evidence of tamponade.
