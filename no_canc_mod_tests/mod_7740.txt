An echo was performed to further evaluate her new DOE and revealed new LV dysfunction.
In addition, at her PCP's office, she reportedly had an EKG with TWI in the inferior distribution.
She was then scheduled for a stress test in the near future.
In the ED, EKG showed T wave inversions in inferior-lateral leads.
She was started on Aspirin, and first set of cardiac enzymes were negative.
She admitted for further evaluation and treatment.

5) Ejection fraction is 48%.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated an LAD with a 99% midvessel stenosis; the major diagonal had a 60% lesion.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertension and markedly elevated LV filling pressures.
Left ventriculography showed depressed LV function with 45% LVEF.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal inferior wall and hypkinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral wall.
Stress test on [**2132-8-18**] demonstrated ischemic EKG changes, and MIBI demonstrated a irreversible defect inferiorly, and a significant reversible area in the apical-septal/septal area.
Her enzymes remained negative but she was started on a Heparin drip and loaded with Plavix.
Cardiac catheterization revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Cardiac surgery was therefore consulted and further evaluation was performed.
