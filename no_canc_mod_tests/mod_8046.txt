She was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic [**4-3**] and underwent an pelvic MRI, later read as a right sacral insufficiency fracture.
In the ED, she had a temp to 101.6, and was noted to be hypotensive sbp 80s (baseline 90s-100s)in the setting of a HCT 24 (baseline 34-36).

Shotty mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged by CT criteria.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Lumbar spine: Sagital and axial images of the lumbar spine after gadolinium administration demonstrate enhancement of the left paraspinal muscles from L2 to L5 extending into the subcutaneous soft tissues.
IMPRESSION: L2 to L5 left paraspinal muscle enhancement extending into the subcutaneous tissues.
[**4-8**] MRI T spine without contrast: There is mild compression of the superior endplate of T11 identified without increased signal on inversion recovery images indicating chronic compression.
[**4-7**] CT Abd/pelvis w/o contrast: No retroperitoneal bleed or intra-abdominal collections.
A repeat MRI of the L-spine was obtained on [**4-16**] which showed no significant interval change in the enhancement of the left paraspinal muscle tissues compared to [**2121-4-9**].
She underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the left paraspinal muscle on [**4-18**], the cultures of which were negative.
The biopsy showed nodular fibroblastic proliferation with associated dense fibrosis and focal chronic inflammation; adjacent skeleton muscle with atrophic and reactive changes; no active inflammation was present.
In terms of other infectious work-up, blood cultures had no growth to date, TTE was without evidence of endocarditis, and urine culture was negative.
Lyme antibody was pending at time of discharge.
[**Doctor First Name **] was negative and RF was not elevated; SPEP and UPEP were without monoclonal bands.
She has a torso CT which showed left apical lung calcific focus, shotty, non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal/hilar LAD, fatty liver, right ischial bursitis, and bilateral hip effusions, but no evidence of malignancy.
The patient underwent a temporal artery biopsy to evaluate for giant cell arteritis on [**4-22**], which was without evidence of arteritis.
She remained afebrile and, at time of discharge, her ESR and CRP were trending down (85 and 119.7, respectively).
Her platelets were also trending down, 318 on discharge from a maximum of 1069.
She should also follow-up with her gastroenterologist for EGD/colonoscopy (given risk of lymphoma with celiac sprue) and have age-appropriate outpatient cancer screening (mammogram - last [**2118**] BIRADS 1, pap smear).
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease (due to celiac sprue vs above inflammatory process), vitamin B12 was elevated, folate wnl, and UPEP/SPEP without monoclonal bands (has had abnormal tests in the past).
Her hematocrit remained stable at 28 following 2 units of PRBC.
6) Hyponatremia: The patient was gently hydrated following admission, given she appeared intravascularly dry, but her sodium continued to trend down to 128.
The nephrology team was consulted, who felt this was secondary to SIADH (possibly related to pain, chest CT/head CT without abnormalities) and recommended fluid restriction (2L/day) and salt tabs.
Her sodium improved to 137 on discharge.
An ultrasound revealed a catheter-associated right cephalic vein clot.
