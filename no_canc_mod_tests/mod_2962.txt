# SYNCOPE - likely due to arrhythmia septal disease in the area involving the bundle of His, potentially exacerbated by increased albuterol use (increased heart rate inducing prolonged pausing at AV node).
We continued losartan 50mg po daily, added metop 25mg PO Q8H for control of arrhythmia.
# AV Replacement: Mechanical AVR in [**2175**] for bicuspid AV, recent Echo ([**6-/2185**]) showed that valve with well seated with no evidence of dehiscence.
