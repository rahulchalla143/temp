Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.
Postero basal -   normal Other findings: Mitral valve was normal.
Arterial time = 0 hour22 minutes.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 3 vessel coronary disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systemic arterial pressure with an SBP of 141 mm Hg.
