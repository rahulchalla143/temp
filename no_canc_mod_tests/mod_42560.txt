A chest xray was performed that revealed bronchiectasis in the upper lobe lesions, with no areas of consolidation.
Troponin was 0.01.
EKG showed LBBB pattern.
She has been receiving nebulizers and sputum cultures were positive for MRSA.
Her oxygen saturations were 94% on 3 liters nasal canula.
FVC 66% of predicted; FEV1 68% of predicted; FVC/FEV1 1.03.
--Bronchiectasis: history of atypical mycobacteria on sputum culture in [**2191**]- followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21848**].
--Aortic stenosis: ECHO in [**2195-4-10**]-The left atrium is mildly  dilated, left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the findings of  the prior study of [**2193-11-28**], there has been no significant change.
Physical Exam: (on transfer): VS: T 96.8, HR 57-77, BP 128-163/46, RR 18-29, O2sat: 92-97% on 3L nasal canula; I/O: 580/965, net:-385 GENERAL: Pleasant elderly Caucasian female who is quite anxious.
Pertinent Results: Imaging: CXR ([**2197-2-4**]):  Mild vascular congestion developed between [**1-31**] and 24, unchanged.
CTA ([**2197-1-31**]):  1.
ECHO ([**2197-1-31**]):  EF 60-70%.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-2-1**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are higher.
cxr [**2-7**]: PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY: The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal and stable.

She had a cta and VQ scan and was ruled out for PE.
The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin, and with MRSA sputum cultures positive, vancomycin was added.
As her blood pressure improved she was started on imdur, hydral, metoprolol, and nifedipine, given the difficulty in controlling her pressure with single agents.
Her pressures continued to be elevated and she was given increased doses of nifedipine and hydral.
At discharge her blood pressure was well-controlled on multiple agents and she will continue imdur, hyral, metoprolol and nifedipine.
She will have close outpatient follow-up and her blood pressure should be monitored then.
3) CHF: The patient had an EF between 60-70% on cardiac ECHO on [**2197-2-3**], with moderate AR and AS, with prolonged mitral deceleration time.
4) Decreased renal function:  The patient presented with a creatinine of 1.4, increased from her baseline of 0.9.
Her blood and urine cultures were negative and the patient was afebrile.
Her white count continued to trend down by discharge.
The patient had some abdominal discomfort during her course, mostly in right upper quadrant, though this remained stable and her LFT's were unremarkable.
The diagnosis and duration of these lesions is unclear, though the patient may need a biopsy as an outpatient.
8. atypical chest pain: The patient developed some chest pain, that was reproducible on exam and seemed not to be acs.
Her enzymes were slighty increased, but trended down and were never positive.
Her lipase trended down and she had no further issues prior to discharge.
