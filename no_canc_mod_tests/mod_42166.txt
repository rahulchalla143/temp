CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2123-12-22**] 3:36 PM No evidence of acute intracranial pathology including no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2123-12-22**] 1:43 PM No evidence of pneumonia.
ECG Study Date of [**2123-12-22**]  11:34:12 AM Baseline artifact.
ECHO Study Date of [**2123-12-23**] The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-3-23**], the right heart [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] are dilated, and the right ventricle is hypokinetic.
PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2123-12-28**] Mild reversible perfusion defect involving the distal anterior wall and septum (LAD territory).
STRESS Study Date of [**2123-12-28**] No angina or ischemic EKG changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 58yo female with who was found down with hyperglycemia, ARF, EKG changes and metabolic abnormalities, altered mental status.
Given significant atrophy on head CT in a 58 year old, acute delerium overlying early onset dementia is likely possibility.
Anion gap likely from starvation ketosis, less likely DKA, or toxic ingestion.
After 4L IVF (mostly 1/2NS) patient's sodium decreased to 157.
Na now 148 with PO and IV free water.
Urine Na and urine osmolality not concerning for diabetes insipidus.
TTE demonstrating RA and RV dilatation, but suggesting relatively normal right sided filling pressures.
# NSTEMI: In ICU, patient noted to have ST depressions laterally, with elevated troponin and CK CK 520, MB 13, Trop 0.16, has trended down.
TTE showed new RV dysfunction and dilated right atrium and ventricle.
MIBI stress negative for ST changes or anginal symptoms.
Nuclear portion with mild reversible perfusion defect involving the distal anterior wall and septum (LAD territory), more apparent compared to previous study in [**2117**].
He thought it was a difficult study to interpret because of the large amount of attenuation that is present in this large woman, but he could not identify any ischemia.
-continue to monitor -held statin due to transaminitis, restarted on discharge  .
# ARF: Admitted with acute on chronic renal failure with Cr 2.0, while baseline .9- 1.1.
Cr 1.2 at discharge.
Initial urine lytes suggested prerenal etiology and renal function improved with IVF.
- restarted ACEi given improvement in renal function - renally dosed meds - trend renal function outpatient - monitor urine output .
# DM Now titrated back to home dose of NPH (34U/29U) with sliding scale.
