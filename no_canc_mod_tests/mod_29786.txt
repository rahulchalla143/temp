[**2135-11-22**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-21**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
The possibility of supervening pneumonia in this region or in the retrocardiac area cannot be excluded, and a lateral view would be most helpful if clinically possible.

Hypoxemia/Acute systolic heart failure:  On initial presentation, CXR demonstrated possible right lower lobe pneumonia, so patient was started on levofloxacin.
However, symptoms did not improve x 2 days, and crackles were heard on exam, so repeat CXR was performed and demonstrated volume overload.
Due to this, an echocardiogram was obtained that demonstrated systolic dysfunction, with an EF of 30-40%, global hypokinesis.
For work up, EKG demonstrated non-specific changes, cardiac enzymes demonstrated a normal CK, but slightly elevated troponin (peak 0.3), and elevated BNP at >3000.
Initial evaluation by respiratory demonstrated very low vital capacity (at 750cc) with normal NIF test, and the patient was therefore temporarily transferred to the intensive care unit for monitering.
However, formal PFTs were performed and demonstrated low vital capacity.
Your pulmonary function tests showed decreased vital capacity and you will need to use BiPap at night.
