Admission Date:  [**2116-9-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-9-23**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension and transfer from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital for cardiac catheterization  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with placement of stent in LAD.
He was transferred back to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**9-2**], where he was reportedly doing well until the morning of transfer, when he was noted to be hypotensive to systolic of 60s.
He was taken to [**Hospital1 882**] ED where initial vitals were T 96.4, BP 76/48, HR 80, 98% on RA.
An EKG reportedly revealed ST depressions with TWI in V2-V3.
A CXR showed CHF.
Troponin T was 0.34 which is actually decreased from 1.74 on discharge.
Labs were notable for mildly elevated creatinine of 1.2, hct 28.9, mild leukocytosis at 11.
A UA was positive and he was given unasyn as well as gentamicin due to concern for urosepsis.
Catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] on the day of transfer revealed markedly elevated right and left sided filling pressures (PCWP 32, PA 60/28), as well as new 100% in stent stenosis of the LAD.
The patient was given 40 mg IV lasix in the cath lab, and another 40 mg IV lasix on arrival to the CCU, with almost 2 L urine output within 2 hours of CCU arrival.

CXR: [**2116-9-10**] FINDINGS:  Heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
Cardiac Cath [**2116-9-10**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Arterial conduit arteriography was not performed as the LIMA-LAD graft was known to be atretic and occluded at the site of anastomosis.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated right and left heart filling pressures (RVEDP = 18 mmHG and LVEDP = 29 mmHg).
LV ventriculography was deferred.
Cardiac Cath [**2116-9-11**]: COMMENTS:     Successful angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery with a 1.5mm balloon and a 2.5mm balloon followed by stenting with a 2.5x8mm MicroDriver (bare metal stent) deployed at 12 atm.
Echo [**2116-9-12**]  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-8-25**], there is probably no significant change.
[**2116-9-14**] 10:42 AM  ART DUP EXT LO UNI;F/U  FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of right lower extremity bypass.
At [**Hospital1 18**], catheterization on [**9-10**] showed 100% in stent restenosis of the LAD stent, which could not be easily passed by balloon.
On the repeat attempt, balloon was passed and stent was placed in the LAD.
Hypotension: Patient had low blood pressures during hospital stay with systolic dipping below 80s during sleep.
Oxygen saturation and urine output remained adequate.
The patient's BB and ACEI may be re-started if his BP continues to rise after discharge.
He was discharged on Lovenox until INR therapeutic and Coumadin will be continued for at least 6 months until repeat echo.
His INR values will need to be followed upon discharge.
T2DM The patient's blood sugars were well controlled during this hospitalization on an ISS.
