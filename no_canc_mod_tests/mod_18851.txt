Cardiac catheterization done on [**2130-11-28**], showed left main at 60-70%, left anterior descending 60%, circumflex 100%, right coronary artery 30%, ejection fraction of 70%.
Echocardiogram on [**11-18**] showed an ejection fraction of 50-55%, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy, inferior hypokinesis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On preadmission testing, his heart rate was 56 and regular, blood pressure 148/90, respirations 20, height 5 ft 6 in, weight 212 lbs.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis 2+ on the right and left.
Radials 1+ bilaterally.
Chest x-ray pending.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus at a rate of 55, with occasional premature ventricular contractions, T-wave inversions in lead III and AVF, normal intervals.
At the time of transfer, the patient was in sinus rhythm with a mean arterial pressure of 80, PA of 25/15.
His anesthesia was reversed, and he was successfully extubated.
His chest tubes remained in place on postoperative day #1, as he had a significant amount of drainage.
On postoperative day #2, the patient was noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 140-160 and a blood pressure ranging from 90-110, not associated with any dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99?????
?, heart rate 68 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 116/50, respirations 20, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
Weight preoperatively 220 lbs, on discharge 100 kg.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 106, CO2 29, BUN 12, creatinine 0.9, glucose 102; white count 8.1, hematocrit 23.5, platelet count 197; PT 13.7, PTT 68, on 1400 U Heparin, INR 1.3.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm reported as 3.5 cm.
Additionally, the patient is to have his INR checked on [**1-17**] in Dr.[**Name (NI) 53002**] office.
He is to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1159**] for an appointment prior to Wednesday morning to schedule a time for his INR check.
