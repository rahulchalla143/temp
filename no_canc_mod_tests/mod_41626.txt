CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**Numeric Identifier 111553**] - CCC *** PRELIMINARY *** PROCEDURE DATE: [**2139-1-3**] INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: STEMI, FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mild elevation of right and left filling pressures with RA of 10 and PCWP of 15mmHG.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.56.
The systemic blood pressure was normal at 118/59.
Successful predilation using 2.0 X 08mm Voyager balloon and stenting using a 2.5 X 08mm Cypher stent of the mid LAD with lesion reduction from 90% to 0%.
4. successful predilation using 2.0 X 08mm Voyager balloon and stenting using 2.5 X 08mm Cypher stent of the proximal D1 with lesion reduction from 90% to 0%.
Successful predilation using 2.0 X 15mm sprinter balloon, stenting using 2.5 X 28mm Cypher stent and post dilation using 3.0 X 20mm Maverick balloon with lesion reuduction from 99% to 0%.

STUDY: AP chest performed on [**2139-1-4**].
Echo [**2139-1-6**]: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed, EF 40%.
Distal anterior, distal septal, and apical hypokinesis to akinesis is present.
A followup ultrasound in [**4-8**] days' time is recommended to confirm continued resolution of this pseudoaneurysm.
s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] to mid-LAD, D-1, and LCx.
Cardiac enzymes trended down post-cath.
Hct stable, s/p 1U transfusion of pRBC on [**1-3**].
- echo to assess LV function and EF post MI was performed.
# Groin Hematoma: U/S showed a partially thrombosed pseudoaneurism [**2139-1-7**].
Creatinine increased from 1.6 to 1.8 on [**2139-1-6**].
creatinine 1.7 on discharge.
Patient will need PT/INR checked every couple of days until INR therapeutic so Lovenox can be stopped.
Lovenox should continue until INR therpeutic.
You were treated for a heart attack with 3 stents that were placed into the blood vessels that supply your heart, in order to prevent them from becoming blocked.
