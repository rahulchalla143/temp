She was GCS of 6 at scene with multiple attempts of intubation in route to [**Location (un) 8641**].
CT of head showed large R SDH, IPH, and frontal skull fracture.
CT of c-spine and torso were also done with no abnormal findings.

MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2164-7-14**] 9:49 PM FINDINGS: There is no disc or vertebral abnormality.
No pathology is seen in the area of the foramen magnum, except for the question of possible small area of hemorrhage along the left posterolateral aspect, suspected on prior head CT scan.
CONCLUSION: Negative cervical spine scan except for questionable finding at the level of the foramen magnum.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2164-7-15**] 4:57 AM Essentially unchanged picture of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with the minimal leftward-shift of midline structure.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2164-7-17**] 7:55 AM Lateral ventricles less prominent than on study from two days prior may represent increasing ICP or cerebral edema.
Intraventricular hemorrhage seen on prior study is less apparent on this current study  CT Head w/o contrast [**2164-7-20**] Parafalcine, small left subdural, and residual right subdural hematomas display no significant interval change with stable appearance to hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic bifrontal contusions with stable post-surgical changes from prior right frontal and temporal lobectomies.
The ventricles appear increased in size compared to the prior exam which likely reflects decreased cerebral edema, as there is also improvement of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are unchanged.
Diastasis of the coronal suture is stable.
There is no CT evidence of an acute pulmonary embolus.
CT of the abdomen could be performed if clinically indicated to further evaluate.
MRI Head [**7-25**]: FINDINGS: Evidence of right frontal/parietal/temporal craniectomy is again seen.
There is dural enhancement at the level of the craniectomy and at the level of the blood products, which is expected in the immediate postoperative and trauma setting.
A small focus of extra-axial, probably subarachnoid blood products is also seen along the floor of the left anterior cranial fossa (series 3, image 16, and series 9, image 64).
Extensive blood products are again seen along the right anterior/inferior frontal and right temporal resection sites.
There is no evidence of parenchymal contrast enhancement outside of the blood products to suggest cerebritis or cerebral abscess.
There is mild rightward shift of the anterior falx and septum pellucidum, which is either stable or minimally decreased compared to [**7-23**], allowing for differences in modalities and the patient positioning.
Dural enhancement at the craniectomy site and in the region of the blood products is expected given the recent surgery and trauma.
If there is a clinical suspicion for a leptomeningeal infection, correlation with a lumbar puncture is suggested.
Chest X-ray [**7-25**]: Tracheostomy tube tip is 3.2 cm above the carina.
An air- fluid level is noted in the stomach.
KUB [**7-27**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-26**], there is a large amount of fecal material throughout the colon as on the prior study.
On [**7-16**], her exam was improved with brisk movements, spontaneous movements in the RUE and localization to noxious stimuli, left upper exteremity was extension to noxious stimuli.
A head CT revealed that the EVD was no longer positioned in the lateral ventricle.
The patient was transferred to the neuro stepdown unit on [**7-22**], where her exam was stable.
On [**7-24**], the patient developed respiratory issues where her O2 saturation was in the 80s and was not cleared with suction.
CXR was performed and a consolidation was identified and antibiotics were started.
Cultures ultimately grew out ACINETOBACTER and STENOTROPHOMONAS.
KUB was performed and negative for any intraabdominal air, but noted to have a significant amount of fecal material present.
She was determined to have SIADH but her sodium was trending up by that day.
Her sodium tablets were stopped and her free water flushes were to be titrated based on her daily levels.
Her exam was much improved with spontaneous movements in the upper extremities and withdrawing to noxious stimuli and able to wiggle toes to stimuli.

?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
* you will need repeat TSH level repeated in [**4-16**] weeks.
