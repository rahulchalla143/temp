CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS  There is no comparison exam.
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis obtained after pre and post-IV contrast enhancement.
Multiplanar volume reformatted images were generated, which were essential in the evaluation of the abdomen and pelvis.
CT ABDOMEN FINDINGS: Images of the lower thorax demonstrate a small right pleural effusion and a chest tube.
Close attention to this area should be paid on further follow-up studies to exclude early/small abscess.

Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology in this case  IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and treatment of pancreatic pseudocyst and pleural effusion.
A CT was placed on HD2, kept to sux until HD7, the placed on water seal until HD9.
After CT scans and monitoring patient's clinical picture, it was decided to take the patient to the OR on HD9.
Blood & urince cultures were sent as well as a cxr.
Patient was discovered to have phlebitis at his picc site with some pus drainage as well as positive blood cultures.
Again spiked a temp on POD3, cultures sent and cxr showed atelectasis vs aspiration and levoquin was started.
serial hcts were done which were all stable.
