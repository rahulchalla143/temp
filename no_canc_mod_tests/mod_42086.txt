On admission the patient had an abdominal CT performed showing: 1.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
Fluoroscopy on the biliary tree showed the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts, biliary radicles, cystic duct, and gallbladder were filled with contrast and well visualized, and there was no evidence of bile leak.
The intra-hepatic  collection has not had any intervention with this hospitalization.
Initially, the patient was kept NPO overnight per protocol following the sphincterotomy, and on the following day, as the day progressed, the patient was having increased abdominal and back pain, and urine output decreased significantly.
A mild elevation in the lipase was noted, and temp to 100.5 was noted and blood cultures were obtained.
On [**9-2**], due to continued decreased urine output, abdominal pain and tachycardia, and fever, the patient was transferred to the SICU.
Lipase peaked at 363 and then started to trend down, however his abdominal exam still revealed pain and still with significant back pain.
Blood cultures have remained negative throughout.
Urine output improved, he was afebrile, and so was transferred back to the surgical floor.
He received 2 units of RBCs for symptomatic Hct 22.9 with appropriate response.
On [**9-3**] he underwent an abdominal CT, assessing the severity of the pancreatitis.
On [**9-7**] he was sent to CT for another drain upsize to a 12 Fr drain.
At the time of the surveillance CT, it was noted that there is oral contrast from the previous CT scan layering in the abscess cavity, suggestive of a fistulous tract to the bowel.
He underwent a fluoro study with Optiray injected through the new 12Fr catheter.
Prior to discontinuation of the TPN, Mr. [**Known lastname 9450**] received a CT scan with injection of contrast through his pigtail catheter to further elucidate the anatomy.
However, the CT did not identify fistula.
Information was obtained from Patient.
