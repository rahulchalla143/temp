He underwent echocardiography which demonstrated severe AS with peak gradient of 119 mmHg, mean gradient of 77 mmHg, and aortic valve area of 0.5 cm square as well as 3+ AI.
The mitral valve was also found to be calcified and restricted with mitral stenosis, a mean gradient of 4, peak gradient of 10, and a calculated mitral valve area of 1.5 cm square along with 2+ MR and 1+ tricuspid insufficiency.
His EF was 70% at that time.
Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] then underwent cardiac catheterization which showed normal left main, normal LAD, normal circumflex and RCA with 50% ostial PDA lesion and 90% focal concentric distal PDA stenosis.
Following cardiac catheterization, the patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, and CABG times one.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 59, blood pressure 159/74, respiratory rate 18, 02 saturation 99% on room air.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA: White count 5.3, hematocrit 43, platelets 131,000.
PT 12, PTT 32, INR 1.
Sodium 142, potassium 4.2, chloride 105, C02 31, BUN 14, creatinine 0.7, glucose 73.
ALT 44, AST 36, alkaline phosphatase 144, total bilirubin 1.8, albumin 4.6.
Chest x-ray is without acute cardiopulmonary changes.
His cross clamp time was 151 minutes.
At the time of transfer, the patient was in normal sinus rhythm at 76 beats per minute with a CVP of 9 and a mean arterial pressure of 74.
The doses then fluctuated between 5 and 7.5 mg and finally on postoperative day number seven, the patient had an INR of 3.3 and it was felt that he was stable and ready to be discharged to home.
At the time of discharge, the patient's physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.3, heart rate 86, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 110/76, respiratory rate 18, 02 saturation 97% on room air.
Weight preoperatively 61 kilograms, at discharge 58.3 kilograms.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The laboratory data revealed a white count of 8.5, hematocrit 32.1, platelets 299,000.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.3, chloride 103, C02 28, BUN 11, creatinine 0.6, glucose 125.
On the day of discharge, the patient is to take 5 mg.  His goal INR was 3 to 3.5.
His INR is to be checked by visiting nurses on [**2159-3-21**], the day following discharge, and the results are to be called into Dr.[**Name (NI) 55126**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3183**].
