His liver function tests were elevated with a total bilirubin of 4.
There was concern for ascending cholangitis and he was started on Ampicillin and Gentamycin and then Timentin and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for an ultrasound and possible endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

Chem 7 142, 3.7, 104, 26, 17, 1.2, 95, INR 1.4, amylase 100.
Urinalysis specific gravity 1.034, positive bilirubin, 30 protein, positive nitrites, small leukocyte esterase, 5 to 9 white blood cells, 1+ bacteria, 0 to 2 red blood cells.
Chest x-ray no abnormalities.
Electrocardiogram sinus bradycardia at 58 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST T wave changes.
Blood cultures were obtained and were negative.
Chest x-ray and KUB were obtained as above.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed demonstrating no son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign, no cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, dilated common bile duct without evaluation of the distal common bile duct secondary to overlying bowel gas, hypoechoic right lobe of the liver.
CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no free air in the abdomen, no obstruction, evidence of diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
MRCP on [**2-23**] demonstrated acute cholecystitis with stones in the distal common bile duct causing dilatation of the common bile duct.
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed on [**2115-2-24**] demonstrating stones of the distal common bile duct, successful biliary sphincterotomy, successful stone and sludge extraction.
On the day of discharge the patient's ALT had gone down to 227, AST 78, total bilirubin 2.6 with an alkaline phosphatase of 199.
However, during his hospital stay his blood pressure remained within normal limits.
He was not tachycardic and his temperature was never above 100.0.
A blood culture obtained from the date of admission on [**2115-2-23**] did, whoever, grow out Klebsiella pneumoniae in one out of four bottles that was pan sensitive.
He was informed to let his doctor know of any fevers or abdominal pain and to avoid aspirins or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs until one week following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
