On initial evaluation at outside hospital, he was noted to have "melanotic" stools, that turned to hematochezia.
On [**7-27**] he had an EGD which showed normal esophagus, stomach and duodenum and then underwent a Pouchoscopy/enetorscopy which showed large amount of fresh bright blood with blold clots, including J pouch and throughout the entire small bowel examined (~ 70cm).
Since the last scope, he was transufsed another 5U of PRBCs and his HCT remained at 22.
He was reported to be hemodynamically "stable", BP 100/50 and HR in 120s.
Past Medical History: Ulcerative colitis - [**7-/2094**] - Ileoanal pouch w/ ileostomy - [**10/2094**] - Laparotomy, resection of small bowel including ileostomy, reanastomosis and dilatation of the anorectal stricture - Aortic valve stenosis, mild per outside hospital records, no documentation at [**Hospital1 18**].
- No bleeding diseases - Brother with coronary artery disease died in 60s - Uncle died of myocardial infarction at 45 - No h/o sudden cardiac deaths or arryhthmia  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97F BP: 135/57 P:90s R: 22 O2: 95%RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera pale, dMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, flat JVP Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally CV: RR, normal S1 + S2, [**3-27**] syst.

[**2100-7-28**] : Transthoracic Echo: IMPRESSION: hyperdynamic left ventricle with severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet; no vegetations seen .
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further intervention.
2 additional pRBCs were administered with target Hct above 30.
On HD3 after another episode of [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] GI bleed, a repeat CT-A demonstrated again no active bleed - 2 more units of pRBC were transfused after a Hct drop below 30.
An upper and lower endoscopy on HD 2 revealed mild duodenitis, old blood, some mild ulcerations of small bowel and mild proctitis.
A push through enteroscopy was performed on HD 3.
The patient was scheduled for an outpatient swallow endoscopy with GI, and observed for 24 more hours for active bleeding and Hct drops below 30.
An echo from an outside hosptial in [**12/2099**] reported a normal LV systolic function with high velocity flow consistent with mild aortic stenosis or high cardiac output and mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
A transthoracic echo on HD 3--requested to investigate the patient's dyspnea on exertion and possible endocarditis with emboli to bowel--reported severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet; no vegetations seen.
ESR of 3 and CRP of 3.1 not concerning for active UC flare.
Cardiac exam notable for III/VI holosystolic murmur loudest at 2 LICS and lightheadedness with ambulation.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital for further evaluation of your gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.
You received multiple blood transfusions and your blood levels stabilized but you had significant amounts of blood in your stool.
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 25350**] within one week of discharge from the hospital.
