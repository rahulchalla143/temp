An ultrasound was done to evaluate the effusion but it appeared to be too small to tap.
Bacteremia:  She grew pseudomonas from her blood at [**Hospital1 **], and the most likely source was felt to be her Quinton catheter given that it had been in for over 6 months.
This was removed by surgery on [**8-5**], although the tip culture was negative.
Her blood pressure remained elevated throughout her hospital course.
Renal failure: Had extensive w/u in the past, biopsy consistent with glomerulonephritis, treated with prednisone and cytoxan.
Her creatinine was elevated on admission but trended down to 1.1 by discharge.
She was transfused here twice, (one unit PRBCs each time) for Hct 25 and 26 respectively.
ECG changes:  Most likely demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia and sepsis, with new lateral TWI's.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Her outpt regimen of labetalol and amlodipine were reinstated, but she remained hypertensive.
Her original regimen was doubled, and hydralazine 20 q6h was added to keep her BP under control.
