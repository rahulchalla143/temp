========================================== MICROBIOLOGY [**2185-10-8**] Blood culture 1/2 bottles positive for coag negative staph [**2185-10-11**] Blood culture no growth to date  Brief Hospital Course: TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [] Blood pressure control, patient on multiple medications.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is 57yo RHW with PMH of HLD and borderline HTN who presented to OSH after her husband found her lying on the floor in their living room window and and CT scan there demonstrated a large R parietal/occipital IPH and R parietal SAH with posterior white matter changes, consistent with PRES.
Her hospital course complicated by difficult to control blood pressure and catheter associated LUE DVT.
Patient also complained of headaches while in the ICU, which improved with blood pressure control.
Her blood pressure goal was SBP 110-160, and she required nicardipine gtt in the ICU.
Patient reports that her blood pressure has been "normal" prior to this.
TTE with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal LVEF (65%).
Her blood pressure was controlled with medications as above and her creatinine improved.
Her CBC was monitored and leukocytosis resolved as above.
Further systemic anticoagulation was not started given her recent multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages.
Amlodipine 10 mg PO DAILY hold for SBP <100 3.
CloniDINE 0.1 mg PO TID hold if SBP <100 4.
HydrALAzine 10 mg IV Q6H:PRN SBP > 160 5.
Labetalol 200 mg PO TID hold for SBP <100, HR <60 6.
Lisinopril 20 mg PO HS hold if SBP <100 7.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush PICC, non-heparin dependent: Flush with 10 mL Normal Saline daily and PRN per lumen.
We placed you on multiple blood pressure medications to help control your blood pressure.
