PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Blood pressure 217/97, heart rate 119, 100% on room air.
Rectal temperature of 100.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had basic laboratories with a white blood cell count of 15.8, a hematocrit of 32.2.
Normal electrolytes except for her blood glucose which was 336.
PT, PTT, and INR were normal.
Her urinalysis showed 0 to 2 white blood cells, and rare bacteria.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Head CT done at the time showed only chronic microvascular changes.
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe opacity, a question of atelectasis.
Blood pressure was controlled.
Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive encephalomalacia change in atrophy from multiple old infarct.
Prior to that a workup for the seizure included a lumbar puncture which was unrevealing with 1 white blood cell, no red blood cells, and a differential of 65% lymphocytes, 30% monocytes, and 5% polys.
Glucose was 126.
Her serum glucose was controlled.
In addition, she had an electroencephalogram on [**12-20**] which showed very low voltage background with beta in most areas, not epileptiform.
Her PTT was kept between 60 and 80.
Her blood pressure was watched carefully.
Her Dilantin levels were followed and on [**12-22**] it was 9.3.
During her stay, her hematocrit fell to 28.
Because of her diabetes and risk factors for coronary artery disease, she was transfused 2 units with a repeat hematocrit of 34 on [**2135-12-25**].
We continued to follow her hematocrit, and again it dipped down to 28, and she needed to receive another transfusion.
Her urine grew out Staphylococcus aureus and group B strep.
The sensitivities studies showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed for a prolonged course of vancomycin.
Vancomycin peak and trough was checked on [**2135-12-29**] which showed a peak of 22 and a trough of 10.9, which seemed adequate and continued on the vancomycin dose 500 mg q.24h.
The patient's neurologic examination improved with her able to have antigravity movement with her left hand.
Her heparin was discontinued after the second hematocrit drop, and Gastrointestinal was consulted.
They had originally planned to take her for upper and lower endoscopy; however, her daughter did not want any intervention unless the patient had life threatening problems, and after the discontinuation of the heparin, her hematocrit remained stable.
Her stools were consistent guaiac-positive through the hematocrit drops, and thus we thought that the source was gastrointestinal.
(hold for a blood pressure of less than 160 and heart rate less than 40).
