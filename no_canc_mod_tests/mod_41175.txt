He was taken to [**Hospital6 3105**], where he received an NIHSS of 9 (breakdown not available on the provided notes) and his head CT did not show acute infarcts by report.
His INR yesterday was 2.6, and today's was 2.7 at the OSH.
Exam was notable for dense L flaccid plegia, nosoagnosia, visual extinction on the L, R gaze preference, impaired body position sensation on the L. Patient immediately was sent for CTA for further characterization of his stroke.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch with no extinction on double simultaneous stimulation.

NONCONTRAST HEAD CT ([**7-28**]): There is a hyperdense middle cerebral artery on the right with obscuration of the lentiform nucleus on the right consistent with infarction.
CT PERFUSION ([**7-28**]): There is a matched perfusion defect in the right MCA territory with delayed transit time and reduced blood flow and blood volume.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
CHEST X-RAY ([**7-28**]): No focal infiltrate.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT ([**8-1**], our read): expected evolution of right MCA infarct with known hemorrhagic conversion.
His exam was concerning for a dense right MCA infarct.
Repeat head CT in our ED showed the right MCA infarct.
CTA revealed a right M2 superior division cutoff.
Mr. [**Known lastname 111885**] was initially admitted to the neurology ICU because his systolic blood pressures were in the low 100s and it was thought he may need vasopressors to attain adequate cerebral perfusion.
In ICU he underwent stroke risk factor workup including TTE (showed no PFO/ASD), full lipid panel (showed LDL 66) and A1C (mildly elevated to 6.4%).
MRI was performed, confirming presence of right MCA infarct.
Of note, the MRI also showed some hemorrhagic conversion of the stroke, but regardless it was decided to continue anticoagulating patient as his neuro exam was stable.
Repeat head CT on day of discharge showed no increase in hemorrhage.
Once his INR drifted below 2, he was started on therapeutic Lovenox 70mg SC BID.
Plan is for him to stay on Lovenox until INR <1.5, and then switch to Pradaxa 150mg [**Hospital1 **].
INR on day of discharge was 1.7.
On discharge, neuro exam was stable to mildly improved from admission: patient AAOx3 with abullic affect, and dense left face/arm/leg hemiplegia.
===================== TRANSITIONS OF CARE: - please D/C Foley when pt arrives to rehab facility, and check post-void residuals - please HOLD morning dose of Lovenox until INR is checked on [**2186-8-2**].
If INR is >1.5, give AM dose of Lovenox and recheck INR on [**2186-8-3**].
If INR is <1.5, STOP Lovenox and START Dabigatran.
(for LDL > 100) () Yes - (x) No (if LDL >100, Reason Not Given: ) 6.
(x) Yes - () No (if LDL >100, Reason Not Given: ) 10.
Enoxaparin Sodium 70 mg SC BID Please STOP enoxaparin once INR is <1.5.
Dabigatran Etexilate 150 mg PO BID To be started AFTER INR is <1.5 (pt should remain on Enoxaparin until then).
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on [**2186-8-2**]:  ---If INR is <1.5, please STOP enoxaparin and START dabigatran (Pradaxa).
---If INR is >1.5, please CONTINUE enoxaparin and recheck INR daily until INR <1.5.
Neuro exam on discharge: dense hemiplegia affecting left face, left arm, and left leg.
We made some changes to your blood thinner medications to help prevent another blood clot from forming and leading to a stroke in the future.
