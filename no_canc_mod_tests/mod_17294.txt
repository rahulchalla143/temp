ENT was emergently consulted and an upper airway bleed was not identified as the nasal passages were packed and blood was still coming from the oropharynx.
The endoscope was passed down to the jejuno-jejunal anastomosis and no blood or bleeding was identified.
On POD2 he passed his barium swallow as no leak or obstruction was noted.
An arterial blood gas was obtained and his pO2 was 54.
He was emergently taken to radiology for a CT angio of his chest and due to the fact that he received barium earlier in the day it was decided to scan his abdomen and pelvis to further evaluate for an anastomotic leak.
His hematocrit had dropped to 24, but he remained hemodynamically stable and his urine output was adequate.
His saturations on room air have been stable and his diet was advanced to stage II.
His hematocrit has been rechecked and it is stable at 27.
He oxygen saturations are now in the high 90's on room air and he is out of bed frequently.
