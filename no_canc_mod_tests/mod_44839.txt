Peak CK 2200, and troponin T 5.21 (baseline Cr 1.5), with troponin on discharge 3.21.
Patient had post-procedure echocardiogram on [**2157-12-27**], which demonstrated no new MR with LV ejection fraction 35% (depressed from [**5-29**] EF 45%).
He presented to [**Hospital 8050**] hospital on [**1-3**] in heart failure, and was given 80 mg 80 IV lasix, morphine.
Here, heparin drip was discontinued (as cardiac enzymes were decreased from prior) and he was given another 80 mg IV lasix and placed on nitroglycerin drip transiently for pulmonary edema.
Chest x-ray here was consistent with heart failure.

CXR [**2157-1-3**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions with prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated native three vessel coronary artery disease in this right dominant circulation.
Graft angiography demonstrated that the SVG-D2 was occluded distally at the previously placed stent.
Right and left heart catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP=15mmHG, mean PCWP=35mmHg, LVEDP=35mmHg).
Cardiac output and index were 4.5 L/min and 2.2/ L/min/m2 respectively.
Left ventriculography was not performed to reduce contrast volume   Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, CABG, CHF, CRI, PAF p/w CHF exacerbation .
His cardiac enzymes were elevated but down-trending from previous admission.
Had cardiac catheterization showing elevated right and left sided pressures with PCWP of 35.
His cardiomyopathy is ischemic judging by wall motion abnormalities and his EF is 35% by echo this admission.
His Cr was Cr 2.0 on admission and 1.7 on discharge.
He will need his Cr checked on his next office visit to see if he is trending down.
CXR infiltrate: He had recently completed course of levoflox for PNA.
