A preoperative echocardiogram also showed moderate mitral regurgitation.
Plan was to do coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve repair, but intraoperatively a transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated severe aortic disease and on opening the pericardium the aorta was found to be heavily calcified and hence decision was made to proceed with off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and leave the mitral valve alone given her high risk for stroke.
