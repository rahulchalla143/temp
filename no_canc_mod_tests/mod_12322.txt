He was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 39783**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for shortness of breath and found to have a new cardiomyopathy with EF 30% and global hypokinesis with some akinesis of the inferior wall.
Stress testing with additional vascular imaging was planned.
The patient underwent pharmacologic stress testing this morning with development of ischemic ECG changes (worsening global ST depression) along with hypotension.
Cardiac catheterization was performed.

Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor native endocardial border definition.
The RA pressure could not be estimated.
Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal with moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF= 25-30 %).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Small echo-dense pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-3-29**], the pericardial effusion is slightly smaller and the heart rate is slower.

Nuclear imaging showed areas of reversibility concerning for Left main disease.
He underwent catheterization which revealed triple vessel disease, severe aortic stenosis and both systolic and diastolic dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30-35%.
Cardiac surgical evaluation was undertaken and surgery was scheduled.
A surface echo was negative preliminarily, however, a TEE demonstrated a significant pericardial effusion with tamponade.
A prolong trial of 0 PEEP was well tolerated and he was again extubated on [**4-9**].
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Potassium Chloride 20 mEq/50 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1) Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for K<4.4 and CR<2.0.
