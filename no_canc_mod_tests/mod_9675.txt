A preoperative computed tomography scan showed a 5-cm X 8-cm mass.
Biopsy revealed high-grade lymphoma consistent with [**Year (4 digits) **] lymphoma.
The patient had a negative positron emission tomography scan, and bone marrow results were negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On admission, the patient's temperature was 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 138/100, his heart rate was 100, and his oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.
Cardiovascular examination was notable for tachycardia; otherwise no murmurs.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission were notable for a white blood cell count of 1.1, with an absolute neutrophil count of 560, his hematocrit was 38.6, and his platelets were 104.
Sodium was 136, potassium was 2.9, chloride was 97, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 13, and his creatinine was 09.
The patient's liver function tests were notable for an AST of 40, ALT was 23, alkaline phosphatase was 106, and total bilirubin was 0.8.
Thus, the patient underwent urine alkalinization to attempt to clear methotrexate.
The patient's methotrexate levels eventually became close to undetectable, and his white blood cell count returned to within normal limits by the time of discharge.
The patient's white blood cell count began to rise, and he was no longer neutropenic.
At this time, the patient had platelets of 39.
A head computed tomography revealed that the patient had a subdural hematoma.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring, neurologic checks, and Neurosurgery was consulted.
The patient had a follow-up head computed tomography which showed that his hematoma was stable.
The patient's platelets were aggressively repleted during this time to keep his platelet count above 100.
The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed evidence of gastritis.
