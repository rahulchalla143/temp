Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-10-13**] atrial fibrillation is new.
Pulmonary vascularity is indistinct which may be in part due to respiratory motion, although mild element of underlying edema cannot be excluded.
[**2114-2-3**] CXR (PA & lat): Frontal and lateral views of the chest again demonstrate severe cardiomegaly.
CXR ([**2114-2-5**]): Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, worsening upper zone vascular redistribution.
ECHO ([**2114-2-5**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
ECHO ([**2114-2-6**]): There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
LV systolic function appears depressed with inferior akinesis, inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere (LV ejection fraction ?35%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
ECHO ([**2114-2-9**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CYTOLOGY: [**2-6**] pleural fluid: 1+ PMLs, G stain/ culture neg, cytology neg for malignant cells  CARDIAC CATH [**2114-2-12**]:  (preliminary results) 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed flow limiting disease in one coronary artery and mild, non-obstructive diseaese of 2 other coronary arteries.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided and elevated left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 9 mm Hg and LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.
PA systolic pressure was normal at 28 mm Hg.
Mean PCWP was top normal at 12 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressures were normal with aortic systolic pressure of 116 mm Hg.
Cardiac index was depressed at 1.93 l/min/m2.
Left ventriculography revealed 2+ mitral regurgitation and LVEF=25% with global hypokinesis.
The patient was started on azithromycin/ ceftriaxone/ and vancomycin (given + blood culture on day of admission) for broad coverage.
Brief MICU course: Upon arrival to the ICU, echo results returned showing moderate LV systolic dysfunction with severe inferolateral hypokinesis and EF 30-35% (EF 55% in [**2110**]), 4+ mitral regurgitation, elevated right-sided pressures, and mild LVH.
The patient underwent diagnostic L thoracentesis, which showed transudative properties with cultures and cytology negative.
Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVTs.
Upon discharge, the patient was continued on cardiac medications, as below, as well as Advair inhaler.
There was no evidence of MI with negative cardiac biomarkers x 3 and no ST-T wave changes suggestive of ischemia.
# Congestive heart failure, acute, systolic and diastolic, EF 25%: As mentioned above, the patient was found to have [**3-6**]+ mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, elevated R-sided pressures, and systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments with EF 35% on [**2-5**] echo.
Cath confirmed severe systolic LV dysfunction (global HK), mild diastolic biventricular dysfunction, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and LVEF 25%.
He was continued on beta-blocker, ACE-I, and CCB for BP and HR control.
# Decompensated Mitral Valve Disease: [**2-5**] echo revealed 4+ mitral regurgitation of unclear etiology.
# Pericardial effusion: The patient presented with an enlarged cardiac silhouette on admission CXR, with 2/4 echo revealing moderate sized effusion with mixed echogenic material.
There were no echocardiographic signs of tamponade, no pulsus paradoxus on exam, and no evidence of tamponade on catheterization.
Creatinine remained stable throughout hospital course, near baseline of 1.0-1.2.
He was discharged with a glucometer to check finger sticks regularly.
# Code: FULL (confirmed with patient and HCP - [**Name (NI) 20806**].
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: - Atrial fibrillation - Hypertension - Diabetes mellitius II - Coronary artery disease - Congestive left heart failure, acute, systolic and diastolic - Mitral valve regurgitation - Benign prostatic hypertrophy - History of renal cell carcinoma status post partial nephrectomy - Corneal injection s/p right corneal transplant - Pericardial effusion - Hematuria due to Foley catheter trauma  Discharge Condition: Good, afebrile and VSS, ambulating well  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath that, upon further workup, was thought to be due to heart failure.
You had several echocardiograms (ultrasounds of the heart), and a cardiac catheterization which confirmed heart valve disease and poor pumping function of the heart (EF ~25%).
If you experience any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, wheezing, dizziness, swelling in the extremities, or any other concerning symptoms please contact your PCP or go to the ER for further evaluation.
