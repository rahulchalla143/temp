[**1-17**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.
Initial urinalysis with 151 WBC, but urine culture grew only yeast.
The patient's white count subsequently trended down, so linezolid was discontinued.
He was continued on just meropenem and his mental status and blood pressure improved.
He had a subsequent urine culture that grew GPCs, likely alpha hemolytic strep or lactobacillus.
He will plan to see him after this acute illness resolves and pull his foley, have him fitted for a condom cath, and recieve botox injections to the bladder.
# Pancytopenia:  Has had pancytopenic reaction to vancomycin in the past, noted to have downtrending WBC count during this stay while on linezolid.
His statin was held as a precautionary measure, and his liver enzymes trended back down to normal as his clinical status improved.
