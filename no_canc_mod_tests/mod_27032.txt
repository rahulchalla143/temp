Radiology: =========== Head CT [**2167-7-28**]: no acute pathology  Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Course: 58 y/o female with recent ambien overdose, down for 2 days, complicated by rhabdo, ARF, b/l compartment syndrome  # Acute Renal Failure - Secondary to rhabdomyolysis.
Given aggressive IVF hydration with normal saline to maintain urine output greater than 100cc/hr.
CK's trended down over her hospital course (peak CK at OSH of 120,000) however creatinine continued to rise from 3.2 on admission to 5.5 over first 24 hours.
Bicarbonate fluids were attempted transiently to maintain hydration and promote urine alkanalization, however this was subsequently discontinued.
Creatinine increased to a peak of 7.7 on [**8-4**], however of note, she remained non-oliguric throughout and did not require dialysis.
Of note, bloody drainage and oozing with hematocrit down to 19-20.
Blood transfusions given to maintain hematocrit greater than 21.
Serum/Urine tox negative on admission.
# ETOH abuse- Monitored for signs/symptoms of withdrawl.
Upon re-starting the coumadin she will need close monitoring of her hemtocrit to monitor for re-bleeding.
