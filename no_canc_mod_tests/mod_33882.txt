Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
He had a b/l carotid ultrasounds to start the potential CABG workup while here.
Echo the day after MI showed EF 35-40% with Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
The peak systolic velocity in the right common carotid artery was 72 cm/sec, in the right ICA proximally was 38 cm/sec, in the mid portion 41 cm/sec and in the distal portion 52 cm/sec.
Peak systolic velocity was 81 cm/sec in the left common carotid [**Last Name (un) **], the left ICA proximally had a peak velocity of 74 cm/sec, 56 cm/sec in the mid portion and 51 cm/sec distally.
Nitro drip was weaned and while in CCU his pressures were within normal limits  # PUMP: After MI pt got an echo which showed LVEF 35-40%.
He can have an outpatient echocardiogram in follow-up.
