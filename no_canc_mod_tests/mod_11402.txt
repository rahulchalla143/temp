CT abdomen pelvis showed no colitis or acute process.
Stool Cx's negative and pt was treated and discharged on Imodium.
He c/o cough on that admission but CXR reportedly negative.
EKG showed sinus at 74 bpm, 1st degree AV block, no change from prior.
Bedside u/s showed minimal effusion visible, no evidence of tamponade.
CXR showed fluid overload, so pt is admitted for HD to remove fluid.

[**3-7**] CXR FINDINGS: AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.
[**3-8**] CXR MPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-7**]: Mild pulmonary edema has improved, severe cardiomegaly has not.
[**3-10**] TTE Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
[**3-19**] TTE Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-3-10**], the left and right ventricular cavities are probably slightly smaller.
Agitated saline was given on the current study and demonstrated shunting, likely through a stretched PFO.
Evaluation of the intra-abdominal viscera is limited by lack of IV contrast.
These are unchanged from previous CT (2:27).
CT PELVIS: The rectum, sigmoid are normal in appearance.
Grossly volume overloaded on exam & by CXR, likely the result of dietary indiscretion coupled with dialysis-dependent ESRD and chronic systolic HF (EF 15-20%) as below.
Cardiology consult service recommend adjusting medications as follows: - transition from lasix to torsemide 40 mg QD - transition from metoprolol to carvedilol 25 [**Hospital1 **] - start spironolactone 25 QD - start metolazone 5 QD - increase lisinopril 20 QD He continued to require regular dialysis for 3L fluid removal per session, but weights, volume status, HR and BP were stable on this new medication regimen for several days prior to discharge, even through 2-day weekend HD "holiday."
Cr was [**5-1**] at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**Month (only) **] [**2183**], then 10 here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) 1096**] - he was convinced to start regular HD here at that time, but continues to believe his renal failure is reversible and refuses fistula placement.
UA showed pyuria as before; this was not treated.
At time of anticipated discharge on HD 10, he suffered large-volume urethral bleed after foley catheter removal (9 pt Hct drop over the subsequent 6 hours).
Ongoing hematuria for 3-4 days, until the day of discharge, when urine was yellow, clear of frank blood and clots.
# UNEXPLAINED HCT DROP On HD5, labs checked at HD reflected 9-pt Hct drop since last check 24h prior.
Curiously, stool guaiac was negative x2 and he was HD stable.
CT abd/pelvis showed no evidence of RP or other intra-abdominal bleeding.
Hct stabilized within 24h and remained stable for several days, until it fell 9 pts a second time in the setting of traumatic foley removal (as above).
