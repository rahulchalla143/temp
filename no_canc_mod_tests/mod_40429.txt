In the ED her initial vital signs were 220/110 120 RR 40 and 100% on BIPAP.
An EKG was interpreted as unchanged from prior.
Nitro-paste was administered for blood pressure control.

# CAD: Although patient has with multiple CAD risk factors, prior non-invasive and invasive testing showed no significant obstructive coronary disease.
A troponin of 0.04 in the context of normal CK and EKG with no ST-T changes was likely demand ischemia secondary to hypertensive heart disease.
Admission EKG did not show signs of active ischemia and the patient was monitored on telemetry and continued on aspirin and statin.
There are no PFT's to support the diagnosis of COPD, but marked hyperinflation on CXR and notable smoking history indicated strong possibility of COPD contributing to patient's symptoms so patient was treated with home dose of spiriva and albuterol as needed.
Her electrolytes were monitored closely with subsequent K between 4.1 and 5.0.
Prior evaluations had not shown renal mass that could contribute to over production of erythropoietin and on [**2163-5-30**] the epo level was low normal which would suggest a MPD such as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
