Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Distal pulses were preserved and there was no evidence of pseudoaneurysm on imaging.
Hematocrit remained stable.
1) Cardiovascular a) Ischemia: Post-lytic, diagnosistic cardiac catheterization demonstrated R-dominant heart with likley culprit D1 lesion with 80% tubular obstruction, and TIMI-3 flow.
CK peak 1766, MB 291, Peak Trop 11.83.
b) Pump: On diagnostic cath, PCWP elevated to 29.
Post-MI TTE was poor quality, but demonstrated EF 70%, mild symmetric LVH, 1+ MR. As above, was maintained on metoprolol, captopril, and spironolactone.
-will need repeat echo 1 month post discharge.
-recheck INR 1-2 days after discharge.

You should go to his office on [**2156-5-6**] to have your labs drawn - you will need to have your INR checked so that your coumadin level can be adjusted.
* Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5310**] from cardiology in 2 weeks -- you will need to call his office for an appointment ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 32399**].
