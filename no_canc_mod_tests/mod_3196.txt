Our goal for transfusion Hct >30, INR <2.0, Plt >50.
A CTA was done early on [**2160-7-20**], which showed no obvious bleed, and IR deferred intervention.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled.
Her Hct was 28 from 30, and her coags were INR 1.2 and PTT 32.4 (improved from previous).
The pt had gone into PEA arrest, a dose of epi was given and chest compressions started at 12:30 am.
