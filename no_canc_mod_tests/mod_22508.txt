CXR [**2-7**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal decrease in extent of the pre-existing multifocal bilateral parenchymal opacities.
CT chest [**2-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Distended gallbladder, correlate clinically, and if necessary, an ultrasound could be performed.
Brief Hospital Course: 83F with PMH dyslipidemia and prior CVA presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED from [**Location (un) 620**] with the complaint of shortness of breath.
A Urinalysis was positive for a urinary tract infection.
Active Issues for her hospitalization include:  # Elevated Troponin: No history of CAD but with 3 risk factors - OSH value of 0.29, reached a peak of 1.09 on HD5 - No specific ST segment abnormalities on presentation - TTE performed on [**2-7**] showed worsened EF to 25% but with global hypokinesis, less concerning for a focal ischemic insult - Pt and her daughter (the HCP) and think the conservative route is best for now - For this reason we treated medically with a heparin gtt, 325 ASA, and afterload reduction with 12.5 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] to minimize strain on the failing LV   - If within the family's care goals, an outpatient workup would include performing an outpatient stress to assess amount of myocardium at risk   - Would then revisit the potential for cath/angioplasty based on those findings .
# New Onset Heart Failure: Previous EF 55%, EF now 20%, global hypokinesis on TTE - We began afterload reduction with low dose Metoprolol, and optimized forward flow and respiratory fluid overload with IV lasix - Discharged on 20 PO lasix, Metop 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], and Lisinopril 1.25QD .
# Hypotension - BP found to be 75/45 on HD3 in the setting of aggressive diuresis - BP on admission noted to be 99/60 - Improved intially to SBP in the mid 80's with gentle fluid boluses totalling 1.5L over 16 hours - On HD4, pt's remained with higher BP's but UOP noted to be marginal, improved with 20 IV lasix - On DOD BP noted to be in the low 100's systolic, with 1.5L of urine made within the last 24hrs .
- Initial treatment was begun with Ciprofloxacin, and was transitioned to Levaquin after a CXR done on HD 2 was notable for a RUL infiltrate - Final UCx showed >100,000 Halfnia Alvei - Treated for a total of 7 days.
#RUL infiltrate: seen on Pa/Lat on [**2-6**] - pt's son noted that she has had a cough over the last week - Treated for 5 days with Levaquin - nurse in am [**2-6**] noted she had trouble swallowing pills, concerning for possible aspiration - Speech and swallow eval recommended ground solids w cup sips .
#[**Last Name (un) **]: - Creatinine on presentation 1.1, rose to 2.0 on HD4 - Likely due to a combination of aggressive diuresis and hypotension - Decreased to 1.5 on DOD .
