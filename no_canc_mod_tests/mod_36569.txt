CT Head [**2152-1-20**]: Stable size of left hemispheric extra-axial collection.
CT Head [**2152-1-21**]: Slight increase in size of acute on chronic left subdural hematoma along frontal and parietal lobe without increase in associated mass effect.
Colonoscopy [**2152-1-24**]: Findings:  	 Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen throught the colon.
In the emergecy department and in the ICU, the patient received a total of 6 units of blood, and his hematocrit increased to 31.2.
