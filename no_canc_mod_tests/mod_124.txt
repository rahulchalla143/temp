Seizures occurred on evening [**2146-1-13**], lasted 30 seconds - 1 minute,  resolved spontaneously.
First seizure occured while he was being cleaned up, second seizure occured while family member (mother?)
Afebrile, T max 99.8, BP 116-120's/86-106, HR 78-129, O2 sat96% on 2L.
VS 98.5, HR 97, PB 134/89, RR 16, 02 sat 100% on 2L.
After arrival to the ICU, it was discovered that he had a urine culture positive for acinetobacter at rehab and was started on imipenem.
Also with rhabdomylosis - CK peaked at 3996, and improved to normal with IVFs, renal failure also resolved.
Last viral load [**8-14**] was 5,860,000.
Asthma 4. h/o Tuberculosis ([**2129**], now resolved) 5. h/o PCP x 2 6. h/o pericarditis ([**2139**]) 7. h/o pneumococcal pneumonia with bacteremia ([**11-10**]) 8. h/o LLL pneumonia ([**12-11**]) 9. h/o MAC on BAL ([**5-11**]) 10. h/o Neuropathy, thought [**1-8**] HIV 11.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 98.1 BP: 142/100 HR: 112 RR: 20 O2sat 100% 2L GEN: agitated, crying out, not oriented, cachectic HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MM dry, thrush on tongue NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout CV: tachy, RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, initially with voluntary guarding but later without EXT: no c/c/e, warm, good pulses SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice NEURO: AAOx0, unable to cooperate with neuro exam  At discharge, vitals were stable.
The remained of his exam was unchanged.
Pertinent Results: CXR ([**2146-1-23**]): Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-12-9**] QS complexes in leads V1-V2 are less prominent and there is less suggestion of possible left ventricular hypertrophy.
CT Head ([**2146-1-13**]): FINDINGS: Multiple acquisitions were performed due to patient compliance.
Despite this, there is motion artifact on the study acquired limiting the evaluation.
IMPRESSION: Stable head CT examination, although the current examination is limited as above.
This finding is new compared to the CT chest on [**2145-12-16**], with interval removal of the nasogastric tube.
There are a few surgical clips, noted lateral to the left side of the thyroid, unchanged in position, compared to the prior CT chest on [**2145-12-16**].
There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present study.
However, the chest is not completely evaluated on the present study.
There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present study.
The most likely etiology for patient's seizures is imipenem which was used to treat his urine culture positive for acinetobacter and elavil which was given at high doses for neuropathy.
Infectious etiology or mass effect were ruled out by [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, benign appearance of CSF, and head CT; however, initially the patient was given empiric IV acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin because of suspicion of viral or bacterial central nervous system infection.
CT showed no CNS mass effect and no acute CNS infectious etiology found.
Please recheck a UA and culture tomorrow ([**2146-1-29**]) to confirm his urine has cleared appropriately.
Neck CT without contrast obtained (could not use contrast as could not obtain peripheral IV access necessary) but study was inconclusive due to patient positioning and lack of contrast.
# Hypokalemia/hypomagnesmia:  On admission, the patient was hypokalemic (K of 3.0) and hypomagnesemic (1.1).
Once discontinued, the patient will not need his electrolytes monitored daily.
Rate was increased by 10 ml/hr every 12 hours with a goal rate of 50 ml/hour acheived at midnight on Sunday [**2146-1-23**].
Trace Elements will be added daily Standard Adult Multivitamins NaCL = 30;  NaAc = 0; NaPO4 = 40; KCl = 10; KAc = 0; KPO4 = 0; MgS04 = 15; CaGluc = 5.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check a urinanalysis and culture on [**2146-1-29**] to ensure the patient has cleared his urinary infection.
