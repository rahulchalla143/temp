History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old WF with a history of hypertension and sepsis [**2-2**] urinary tract infection, who originally presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with altered mental status, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2196-1-10**] for further management of sepsis [**2-2**] urinary tract infection.
Her MICU course has been complicated by new atrial fibrillation with RVR, for which she was initially given dilt IV and dilt PO without improvement in her rate (100s-110s).
Of note, she had presented with [**Last Name (un) **] with baseline creatinine of 1.0, but her creatinine has increased to 2.0 in the MICU.
BP: 136/100 (124-136/88-100) GEN: elderly woman, NAD, very pleasant.

Urine Culture [**2196-1-19**]:  No growth to date.
ECG [**2196-1-10**]:  Artifact is present.
ECG [**2196-1-10**]:  Sinus bradycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing sinus rhythm is now apparent and the P-R interval is prolonged.
ECG [**2196-1-10**]:  Sinus rhythm.
Chest Radiograph [**2196-1-10**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**2196-1-12**]:  The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Chest Radiography [**2196-1-19**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**1-13**], the monitoring and support devices have been removed.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis [**2196-1-21**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
Renal Ultrasound [**2196-1-21**]:  Very limited study as the patient can not hold their breath.
CXR [**1-25**] Lung volumes are much lower, probably due to atelectasis, and a contribution of small subpulmonic pleural effusions, greater today than on [**1-19**].
Right upper lung shows vascular congestion but pulmonary edema if present, is mild.
Discharge labs: 2.9>32.2<244 PT 40.6, PTT 37.8, INR 4.3 147/3.6/107/32/24/1.6<94 Ca 8.8, Mg 2.4, Phos 3.3   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old Caucasian female with history of hypertension and urosepsis, admitted to the MICU with sepsis secondary to URI, with hospital course complicated by new atrial fibrillation with RVR in setting of pressors, ARF, pulmonary edema attributed to volume resuscitation, and c. diff colitis.
She had a RIJ cordis placed at [**Hospital1 **] for access.
Surveillance culture data has been negative thus far.
With uptitration of diltiazem gtt, blood pressure found to drop to the 80s-90s.
Heart rate was still in the low 100s.
She was anticoagulated with and INR >4 at discharge with coumadin being held X1 dose on [**1-28**].
It should be held and restarted once her daily INR is <3.0.
Echo demonstrated moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension, preserved LV function and cavity size, and a moderately dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Upon reaching the floor, repeat chest radiograph demonstrated mild fullness of pulmonary vessels.
While baseline appeared to be approximately 1.0, creatinine was found to be 2.6 on admission, likely due to volume depletion or hypotension in the setting of sepsis.
Creatinine at the time of discharge was 1.6.
Sodium at the time of discharge was 147.
Will need daily sodium checks and should encourage PO free water, and should consider D5W if continues to rise with the addition of lasix due to volume overload.
Upon reaching the general medicine floor, foley was discontinued, but failed voiding trial with bladder scan showing >500cc's.
Patient underwent straight catheterization with post void residual >500cc's.
CT abdomen and pelvis was performed and demonstrated bilateral hydroureter with shaggy appearance of the ureteral lining without a focal point of narrowing to suggest obstruction that is most likely related to her infection from known urosepsis.
Renal ultrasound was performed but was of poor quality.
Will continue outpatient workup with urology as an outpatient.
Potassium stable at the time of discharge.
Hematocrit was closely followed and has been stable.
MEDS ON TRANSFER FROM MICU TO GENERAL MEDICINE FLOOR: Flagyl 500mg IV Q8hrs Neutra-Phos 1pkt [**Hospital1 **] Heparin SQ Miconazole powder 2% topical QID PRN skin breakdown IVF: 1000ml D5W @ 125ml/hr  Discharge Medications: 1.
You needed medications to sustain your blood pressure and needed to be placed on a breathing machine when you first arrived.
You had an irregular heart rate called atrial fibrillation.
You had to start on a medication called Coumadin to keep your blood thin.
We have made the following changes to your medications: - STOPPED lisinopril.
- STOPPED atenolol - STOPPED potassium chloride - STARTED flagyl three times a day.
You were taking 2mg daily and your INR was high, so you will have to have this closely monitored and you will likely need a lower dose when you restart it when your INR is less than 3.0 - START Amiodarone 400mg twice a day through [**2-2**].
Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8058**].
Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4537**].
You should have outpatient pulmonary function tests to check your lung function as an outpatient.
You will need to have your INR checked daily until your INR is less than 3.0, then restart coumadin and continue to have your INR checked regularly.
You will need daily sodium checks and should drink free water, and should consider D5W if continues to rise with the addition of lasix due to volume overload.
Your sodium was 147 at discharge.
