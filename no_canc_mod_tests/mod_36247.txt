CXR was consistent with CHF exacerbation and BNP was >15,000.
U/S of the abdomen was performed that was unremarkable and LENI were negative for DVT.
The patient also received 1U pRBC for Hb 8.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM (per admission note [**2125-2-20**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**]: V/S: T:96.1 BP:160/62 HR:61 RR:10 O2 98% 4L Gen: NAD/ pt somnolent, slow to respond to questions, difficulty concentrating, orient x3.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2122-9-8**] no change.
Color Doppler evaluation of the transplant renal vasculature shows normal flow and waveforms, with resistive indices ranging from 0.7 to 0.75 in the segmental arterial branches.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-9-10**], wall motion abnormalities are probably new (prior echo images were suboptimal).
[**2125-2-23**] CXR AP PORTABLE CHEST: The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.
[**2125-3-3**] LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER U/S FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler images of the left and right common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and peroneal veins were performed.
There is absence of color flow and non-compressibility of the left peroneal vein, otherwise, there is normal color flow, compressibility and augmentation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-2-21**], the estimated pulmonary artery pressures are now indeterminate.
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images were obtained.
Brief Hospital Course: #DVT/PE - Lower extremity doppler U/S on [**2125-3-3**] revealed thrombus in the left peroneal vein.
V/Q scan was deferred due to underlying COPD and a baseline abnormal CXR, and CTA chest was deferred due to renal insufficiency.
Repeat U/S [**3-9**] showed resolution of DVT.
Coumadin was started [**3-9**] after hematocrit had remained stable (goal INR 2-2.5).
Goal INR is at the lower end of the therapeutic range due to his GI AVM's, prior bleeding and risk for re-bleeding.
#Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure - Attributed to a combination of discontinuation of diuretic medication, alterations in the antihypertensive regimen, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
TTE [**2-21**] revealed LVEF 35-40%, moderate septal hypokinesis, and mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior segments.
An ACEi was not prescribed due to allergy.
Initial renal ultrasound was unremarkable, but repeat exam on [**3-9**] revealed evidence of rejection.
#Acute blood loss anemia - The patient had guaiac positive stools without overt evidence of bleeding.
#Toxic encephalopathy - Attributed to effects of medications, as mental status improved after the discontinuation of prednisone and oral narcotics.
ABG was not suggestive of profound hypercarbia or hypoxia.
EKG did not reveal evidence of new ischemia or arrhythmia.
Aspirin, betablocker, and statin were continued, as above.
#Hypertension - Blood pressure was well-controlled on a regimen of metoprolol and isosorbide mononitrate.
