CT Abd: IMPRESSION: 1) Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Repeat CXR 12:15 am: increase in size of (B) pleural effusions and new development of CHF   Brief Hospital Course:    1) Hypotension: Sepsis was not likely initially, however patient was spiking fevers with white count.
2) Abd pain:  Meserentic ischemia less likely as no evidence of pneumatosis on CT abd; no abnormal bowel loops seen.
Changes on RUQ U/S likely related to volume overload 2) Respiratory: patient was vented 3) [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**]: Ct angio revealed 1.6 cm [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**] clot, was on on heparin drip, dc'ed secondary to hempotysis 4) afib: continue on amiodarone 6) DM: blood sugar under good control  Patient clinical status continued to decline, the patients family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and her code status was changed.
