As he did manage to stand up with his IABP in place, a CT scan was performed which was negative for dissection or aneurysm.
A CT of his head was negative, this done due to his combativeness.
Pacing wires and CTs were removed according to protocols and beta blockers and diuretics were begun.
Discharge medications, followup and limitations were discussed with the patient prior to discharge.
