His sputum culture grew 2 types of GNR that were not speciated.
In the ED initial vital signs were 97.6 123 145/72 24 95% 3L.
He underwent CTA that showed RLL segmental PE with associated RLL infarct.
Leukocytosis of 22.0 and lactate of 2.9.
The patient continued to be tachycardic with rates 105-110, SBP stable ranging 120-140, and O2 sats 100% on 3L.
AAA has area of calification/hyperdensity likely represents thrombus, but would recommend non-con CT to better evaluated for possible leak.
BUE [**3-26**], and BLE [**3-26**] both proximally and distally.
Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: WBC 22.0, HGB/HCT 13.1/39.8, PLT 321 .
Discharge Labs: WBC 11.5, HGB/HCT 9.9/31.2, PLT 280 PTT 45.1 (subtherapeutic and increased), INR 1.5 140 / 102 / 8 /  100 4.2 / 33 / 0.5\ Ca 8.4, Mg 1.8, Ph 2.5 Vanco Trough 27.2 Anemia labs [**2132-1-1**]: combined anemia from iron deficiency and chronic disease Vit B12 828 (nl) and Folate 7.1 (nl) Ferritin normal at 313 TIBC low at 163 Iron low at 12 .
MICROBIOLOGY: Urine Culture [**2131-12-30**]:  Legionella Urine Ag Negative Blood Culture [**2131-12-29**] and [**2131-12-30**]: No growth to date (not finalized at discharge) Sputum Cx [**2131-12-30**]: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2131-12-30**]):       <10 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper respiratory       secretions.
Bacterial culture results are invalid.
Urine Culture [**2131-12-29**]:  ESCHERICHIA COLI.
IMAGING/STUDIES: CXR Portable [**2131-12-29**]: The lungs again are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and prominence of the interstitial markings with relative lucency of the upper lobes, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
CT Abd/Pelvis w/o Contrast and CTA [**2131-12-29**]: 1.
Noncontrast CT scan of this area is recommended to confirm.
CXR for line placement of 42 cm PICC [**2131-12-31**]: The cardiac, mediastinal and hila contours are normal and unchanged from [**2131-12-30**].
Lung opacity is worsened since [**2131-12-30**].
MRCP [**2132-1-1**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
If concern persists, ERCP could be performed for further evaluation.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is partially thrombosed, and unchanged in appearance when compared to the recent CT, and better evaluated on that CT. 5.
# PNA: Patient noted to have cough and leukocytosis as well as LLL consodiation on CT scan.
Sputum culture was obtained, but showed only upper respiratory flora.
He should have a follow-up CT chest in [**2-26**] weeks to ensure resolution of LLL consolidation.
Vancomycin dosing was decreased from 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 750 mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Weight Loss: Pt with recent significant weight loss over the past few months, as well as multiple abnormalities on CT suggestive of possible malignancy.
Results show similar findings to CT scan; moderate dilation of common bile duct and pancreatic duct, most likely due to papillary stenosis vs. Sphincter of Oddi dysfuncion, but no evidence of malignancy.
In addition, he will need a follow-up CT of chest to re-evaluate the LLL infiltrate, ensure resolution and no underlying malignancy.
#Anemia:  Hemoglobin and Hematocrit lower compared to patient's baseline.
Guaiac negative stool.
Will also need outpatient colonoscopy as above.
His Hct should be checked [**12-26**] days after discharge to ensure it has not dropped further.
Hct on the day of discharge was 31.2.
He has had multiple hospitalizations and a recent intubation in [**2131-9-23**] for COPD exacerbation and pneumonia.
AAA: Pt with increase in AAA since [**2125**], but stable on this admission compared to recent ultrasound [**2131-12-18**].
CT scans were reviewed by vascular surgery, who felt there was no evidence of leak and no current indication for surgical intervention.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Increase as approprate for goal INR [**12-26**].
Sodium Chloride 0.9 % 0.9 % Piggyback Sig: Three (3) ML Intravenous Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for line flush.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check CBC on [**2132-1-6**] to ensure Hct stable.
