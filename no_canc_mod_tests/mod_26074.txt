Most recent echocardiogram has shown progression of his mitral regurgitation to moderate/severe with a flail posterior leaflet.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is a mean transmitral pressure gradient of 3 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 6.3 L/min.
