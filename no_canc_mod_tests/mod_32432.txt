WBC was 13.8, K 2.8, Bili 7.7, AST 324, ALT 370, alk phos 251, lipast 4877.
CT of the abdomen revealed enlarged indistinct pancreas, extensive peripancreatic fluid consistent with severe pancreatitis and pancreatic necrosis, no loculated or drainable fluid collections or evidence of perforation.

Note is made  CT Head [**10-16**] There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhages, edema, masses, mass effect, or large area of infarction.
EEG [**10-17**] Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the moderately severe suppression of the background throughout.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**10-18**] No intracranial abnormalities detected.
CT A/p [**10-19**] IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE [**10-19**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Moderate pulmonary hypertension  CT Chest [**10-23**] 1.
CT Chest [**10-26**] IMPRESSION: 1.
A chest CT following resolution of patient's acute symptoms is again advised.

OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis.
There, she had PT/OT, blood transfusion for anemia from hemorrhagic pancreatitis, and diuresis.
She underwent repeat CT of the chest on [**2164-11-2**] which showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions and anterior loculated left pleural effusion.
Head imaging was negative (CT and MRI)including EEG.
CT chest on [**10-26**] was concerning for worsening multifocal pneumonia, so her antibiotics were changed from Imipenem to Vanco/Zosyn.
She underwent repeat CT of the chest on [**2164-11-2**] which showed left anterior loculated effusion.
CT chest showed interstitial changes and pleural effusions.
Bronchoscopy on [**10-17**] was WNL, and samples significant only for 2+ polys and staph aureus.
CTA was negative for PE.
we found a small lung lesion that needs to be followed up with repeat CT of the chest once you recover.
