Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-1-24**] left bundle-branch block is new.
CXR [**1-16**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Bilaterally small kidneys consistent with chronic renal disease  Cath [**1-18**] COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel branch CAD with diffuse atherosclerosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 10 mm Hg.
Left sided filling pressures were severely elevated with LVEDP of 37 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressures were elevated with aortic systolic pressure of 155 mm Hg.
Cardiac index was preserved at 3.1 l/min/m2.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
TTE [**1-19**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-1-23**], left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced, the left ventricular cavity size is larger and the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed.
