Here his initial ABG demonstrating ARDS by P/F ratio of 100 and CXR with b/l lower lobe infiltrates.
His Ht is 5'8" so 6cc/kg of IBW would be ~400 ccs, his HOB was elevated, his PIPs and Plateau pressures were closely monitored.
An Echo with bubble study was performed to assess for shunt showed no shunt.
However as he continued to be hypoxic he was started on Heparin drip for possible PE given new RV dilation and Pulm HTN on Echo [**2181-11-12**].
CTA was not performed due to renal failure.
His blood pressure required pressor support.
Sepsis - He completed 7 day course of inhaled tobramycin for Acinetobacter VAP.
