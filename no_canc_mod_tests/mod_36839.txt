Please note that radiographic examination cannot address the site of catheter insertion.
Serial venograms were performed at the level of the arm, shoulder and chest, for possible venous outflow stenosis.
Diagnostic venograms demonstrate two areas of narrowing, one within the fistula in the proximal cephalic vein, and proximal to the level of the junction of the cephalic vein with the axillary vein.
A roadmap venogram was obtained, and a 6 mm balloon was advanced over the wire up to the level of the narrowings, and several balloon dilations were performed at dilations up to 15 ATM.
A second area of narrowing was dilated with a 7 mm balloon up to 10 ATM.
Followup venogram demonstrated partial angiographic improvement of venous outflow after dilation.
Films were also obtained for evaluation of the arterial anastomosis without any significant stenosis seen.
Left AV fistulogram demonstrates two areas of venous narrowing at the level of the proximal cephalic vein near the fistula and near the junction of the cephalic vein with the axillary vein.
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color and spectral Doppler ultrasound images of right upper extremity veins were obtained.
The right axillary, subclavian, brachial, and basilic veins demonstrate normal respiratory phasicity and response to distal augmentation.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
His Hct was intially 15 but after 7 Units of prbcs, patients HCt had improved to 30 and remained stable.
An AV fistulogram was done which showed stenosis at the venous anastomosis and angioplasty was done x4 with partial resolution.
#CAD: s/p MI - Pt has ruled out x3.
You were admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring and treatment.
You received 7 units of blood to improve your blood levels.
In addition, you had some blood tests to rule out any evidence of ischemia to your heart.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
You should return to the ED with fatigue, dizziness, black or bloody stools, recurrent chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or for any other problems that concern you.
