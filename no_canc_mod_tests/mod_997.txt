Imaging: Cardiac Catheterization [**2185-3-5**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Right heart catheterization revealed normal right and left sided filling pressures.
Cardiac output and cardiac index were normal.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis in the stented segment with no embolisation or dissection.
ECHO [**2185-3-5**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis (focused views only) estimated LVEF ?50%.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2185-3-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**2185-3-7**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure.
Upon presentation to the ED, the patient was noted to have ST elevations in the inferior leads on EKG (II, III, aVF) and right-sided EKG demonstrated ST elevation in the Right sided precordial leads, including lead rV4.
The cardiac catheterization demonstrated proximal RCA total occlusion, that was rescued by wire stent placement.
The catheterization also demonstrated evidence of diffuse disease, with left main coronary artery with a distal 40-50% lesion, the left anterior descending artery noted to be a small vessel with diffuse disease (50-60% stenoses), the first diagonal branch (2.0 mm vessel) with a tubular 90% lesion, and the OM1 has a 60% ostial stenosis.
Following cardiac cath, patient was started on plavix 75mg qd, aspirin 325mg qd, lipitor 80mg qd, metoprolol which was titrated up and changed to toprol xl on discharge.
In terms of other ischemic management, patient's cardiac enzymes were trended, demonstrating a CK peak of [**2191**].
Therefore a chest/abd/pelvis CT was obtained to rule out a bleed which was negative.
Patient underwent post-cath ECHO that demonstrated EF > 55%, mildly depressed LV function, resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior hypokinesis and basal inferoseptal hypokinesis, nl RV function, trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
