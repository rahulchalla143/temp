EKG showed inferior STE.
Labs were notable for hyperkalemia of 6.5, troponin of 0.06.
In ED EKG showed STE in inferior leads, U/S showed paradoxical septal wall motion and overall hypokinesis, worsened by dopamine.

IMAGING [**2122-9-27**] Cardiac cath 1.
Limited resting hemodyanmics revealed elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with PASP of 54mmHG and mean PCWP of 35mmHg.
Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with an estimated LV ejection fraction of less than 30%.
Cardiac index was preserved at 4.5 L/min/m2 using a pulmonary arterial saturation of 85% in the Fick equation.
Compared to [**2122-9-27**], left ventricular function appears less depressed but views are suboptimal for comparison.
[**2122-10-1**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Scattered air-fluid levels are seen within left mastoid air cells.
A mucus retention cyst is seen within the left maxillary sinus.
Etiology of arrest is most likely secondary to ischemia, given pt also presented with STEMI and cath lab revealed large circ lesion, as described below.
#Cardiogenic shock: Pt has no known history of CHF, but cath lab shows evidence of severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of 30% with global hypokinesis.
Only unexplained factor is elevated mixed venous sats, which would raise concern for sepsis and a RLL opacity was shown on CXR, concerning for pneumonia (HAP v. aspiration).
He was initially put on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl but as his sputum culture grew MSSA, he was only continued on cefepime and then PO cefpodoxime for a total 8 day course of antibiotics.
Cath revealed two vessel disease, stenosed LCx and there was successful PCI of the proximal LCx with a 2.75 x 12 mm Integrity BMS.
#RLL pneumonia: Pt had a WBC up to 20.2 with a left shift and RLL pneumonia became apparent on chest x-ray from [**9-28**] and pt was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl but as his sputum culture grew MSSA, he was only continued on cefepime and then PO cefpodoxime for a total 8 day course of antibiotics.
WBC normalized throughout the hospital course, and was 13.0 the day of discharge.
Labs from OSH showed negative serum tox for alcohol.
Urine tox screen was negative for other substances.
CIWA protocol was not intitiated because during the period of expected withdrawal, pt was receiving benzodiazepines while he was intubated and sedated.
Your memory is only slightly impaired during the evaluation by occupational therapy.
