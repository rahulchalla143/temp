MICROBIOLOGY: Urine Culture [**11-14**] No growth Blood Culture [**11-13**] No growth .
PERTINENT STUDIES CXR [**11-14**] Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
EEG [**11-14**] EEG: Limited study because of frequent bursts of EMG activity from jaw clenching.
If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sedation may be helpful.
CT spine [**11-13**] IMPRESSION: No fracture or subluxation within the cervical spine.
CT head [**11-13**] IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial findings.
CXR [**2139-11-18**]: FINDINGS: Frontal view of the chest.
CT showed no acute intracranial process.
Infection was considered given initial leukocytosis, but urine and blood cultures were negative and leukocytosis resolved on its own by [**2139-11-19**].
Atrial fibrillation: During this admission, the patient had episodes of rapid ventricular rate with an ECG showing strain on [**2139-11-18**].
Labs showed a small troponin leak and cardiology was consulted; they felt the elevated troponin represented strain secondary to increased rate.
Imaging was obtained to make sure you did not have any damage to your brain, which you did not.
