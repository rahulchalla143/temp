She became hypertensive to the 210s systolic, so IV nicardipine gtt was started along with nimodipine A stat head CT showed diffuse SAH ([**Doctor Last Name **] III).
Discharge: Expired   Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2150-3-28**]: HEAD CT: There is diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage predominantly in the posterior fossa also in the suprasellar cistern and extending predominantly to the right sylvian fissure and interhemispheric fissure as well as convexity sulci.
Head CTA [**2150-3-28**]: CT angiography of the head demonstrates a calcified and thrombosed aneurysm at the basilar artery with possible filling of the small portion of the aneurysm and its medial portion.
Neck CTA [**2150-3-28**]: Negative for vascular anomalies.
Head CT [**2150-3-28**]: IMPRESSION: Left frontal approach EVD ends in the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Head CT [**2150-4-1**]: IMPRESSION: Status post coiling of right basilar tip aneurysm and left frontal ventriculostomy catheter insertion.
Slight reduction in the size of lateral and third ventricles and stable appearance of the dilated temporal horns.
Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, predominantly right-sided, and no evidence of a new hemorrhage in the brain parenchyma.
Blood also seen within third and fourth ventricles.
CTA read- pending re-cons, but pre-lim negative for further aneurysms.
A CTA was suggestive of possible small aneurysms at the basilar tip (around a previously thrombosed aneurysm) and possibly at the R PCA.
A four vessel angio revealed one aneurysm at the basilar tip which was secured with two coils on [**3-28**].
On [**3-30**], her HCT dropped to 25.9 thus to maintain consistent cerebral perfusion she was transfused 2 units.
Post transfusion HCT was 32.7.
On [**3-31**], her HCT remained stable.
A non contrast head CT was ordered which showed a new left ventricular hemorrhage, we initiated TPA flushes thru her ventriculostomy with little effect.
