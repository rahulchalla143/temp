Given her history of hepatic sarcoidsis, the patient underwent CT of abd/pelvis revealing a transition point in RLQ pelvis with fecalization of SB proximal to this pt.
Of note, prior CT on [**12-10**] had revealed cirrhosis and portal HTN with TIPS shunt occluded.
The patient was thus taken to the OR on [**12-25**] where she underwent exploratory laparotomy with enterotomy and lysis of adhesions.
Esophageal Varices/Anemia/Portal Gastropathy She also had an EGD on [**12-28**] that revealed 3 nonbleeding grade 2 varices in distal esophagus and portal hypertension gastritis w small blood clot in stomach; no active bleeding.
Acute Renal Failure    While on surgical service, the patient was also noted to have an increase in her creatinine from 1.3 to 2.2; this was thought secondary to large fluid losses from her JP drain in her abdomen; she was started on replacements 1/2 cc/cc with improvement in her creatinine to 1.2 on [**1-1**].
She again developed a rise in her creatinine on [**1-18**].
Urine microscopy showed granular and hyaline cast.
Urine lytes were not consistent with pre-renal but renal felt this was a pre-renal/evolving ATN picture.
Creatinine trended down prior to discharge.
Unfortunately, she then developed increasing abdominal pain; on [**1-5**] she underwent repeat CT scan of abd/pelvis that revealed persistent dilation of multiple loops of small bowel with wall thickening and mesenteric edema without a definitive transition point concerning for a mixed mechanical and functional obstruction, a cirrhotic liver with TIPS and portal hypertension, such as splenomegaly, and diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
The JP drain fluid was sent for analysis; Klebsiella oxytoca and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] grew out from the fluid both on [**1-5**] and [**1-6**].
Serial paracenteses were performed until pt no longer had evidence of bacterial peritonitis with <250 polys in ascitic fluid.
The patient's abdominal exam gradually improved, her NGT was discontinued on [**1-8**], and she was started on a regular diet given that she was passing gas and having bowel movements.
Because of her improved exam, decreased output from her JP and the thought that her fluid status could be better managed with the drain out, her JP drain was removed.
She did have some tenederness on abdominal exam on [**1-15**], and so she underwent another CT scan that revealed increased ascites compared to prior study but no focal fluid collection to suggest abscess formation.
She underwent an abd U/S on [**1-13**] that revealed scant ascites, patent vasculature, and biliary dilatation.
Her EEG on [**1-15**] was consistent with this and negative for seizure per neurology although there was a questionable focus in the frontal lobe.
Her glucose and electrolytes were wnl.
EKG and cxr were wnl during this episode.
