A chest CT performed on admission revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
On [**3-19**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy which yielded an aspirate that was negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] biopsy that has remained negative to date.
Over the course of the following three days, serial chest x-rays revealed a progression of the infiltrative process, and the patient's antibiotic coverage was changed to Levaquin.
In addition, on [**3-21**], his respiratory status continued to deteriorate with a decline in oxygen saturation of 89% on 3 liters to 91% on 4 liters.
On [**3-22**], he was satting 87% on 3 liters and 90% to 92% on a nonrebreather.
A chest x-ray at that time revealed a worsening interstitial process (congestive heart failure versus acute respiratory distress syndrome), and the patient was given Lasix 40 mg IV and transferred to the medical intensive care unit for closer monitoring.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination upon transfer, his vitals were as follows.
He had temperature current of 100.1, a heart rate of 104, a respiratory rate of 24, a blood pressure of 180/90.
He was satting 91% on room air, 3 liters nasal cannula.
His head, ears, nose, eyes and throat examination was notable for ptosis of the left eye; however, his pupils were equal, round and reactive to light.
His skin examination revealed multiple raised red papules with dry serous discharge and hemorrhagic crust.
Cardiac examination was notable for a normal S1 and S2.
Pulmonary examination revealed positive bowel sounds, mild crackles at the bases.
His extremity examination was normal with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, and no calf tenderness.
LABORATORY:  His laboratory values were notable for a hematocrit of 26.4, a chloride level of 15, and a BUN of 71, and a creatinine of 2.5 with a glucose of 181.
To date, on admission, microbiology work revealed negative blood cultures, negative urine, negative cryptococcal antigen, and a negative toxoplasma serology.
Pathology revealed no anaerobes, and the AFB smear was negative, and so were fungal cultures.
His urine revealed no eosinophils.
He had an echocardiogram done on [**3-23**] which revealed left atrial left atrial enlargement, 5, and mild-to-moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40%.
His echocardiogram also revealed anteroseptal akinesis and apical akinesis as well.
Trivial mitral regurgitation and a small pericardial effusion were also noted on the echocardiogram performed on [**3-23**].
Chest x-ray revealed no changes in the infiltrative process noted on his admission films.
CARDIAC:  The patient's blood pressure was managed effectively with Procardia and Pravachol.
On admission, given the abnormalities noted on the patient's echocardiogram, he was scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] for further cardiac management given the findings consistent with mild congestive heart failure on chest x-ray in addition to the abnormal findings on echocardiogram.
Although [**Female First Name (un) **] was noted on a bronchoalveolar lavage performed earlier in the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, it was infectious disease's belief that it simply reflected a contaminant and was not a primary source for the patient's condition; and thus, there was no treatment necessary for this positive finding of [**Female First Name (un) **].
Although an elevated BUN and creatinine were noted earlier in the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, it continued to improve during the latter part of his hospitalization; more specifically, upon transfer to the medical floor.
times 10 to 14 days.
NPH 32 units in the a.m., 13 units in the p.m. 11.
