In the ED, he was found to have a BP of 50/40, with a lactate of 8.1, with guaiac positive stool and acute renal failure (baseline Cr 0.4, Cr on admission 3.9).
In addition, his WBC count was 12.9.
As there was concern for intraabdominal infection as source of sepsis, pt was taken for an exploratory laparotomy.

Evaluation of the bowel for ischemia or other pathologic process is particularly limited.
If there are no outside prior studies to document stability, further evaluation may be performed by ultrasound.

Right ventricular systolic function is normal.

Lactate decreased over 4 hours to 2.
Concern was for peritonitis, and pt was emergently taken to OR on [**6-3**] for an exploratory laparotomy.
No source of peritonitis was found; there was some purulent peritoneal fluid, which did not grow any microorganisms, and dusky-appearing, but viable, bowel; the duskiness was thought to be due to hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis.
Sputum cultures were unrevealing.
Urine and serum osms were sent, the results of which were consistent with SIADH.
Pt was free water restricted, and sodium was monitored.
5.  anemia - Pt's Hct remained stable without evidence of GI bleed or other source of bleed.
Hct was monitored, and remained stable.
6.  panhypopituitarism - pt was maintained on low dose prednisone, per outpatient regimen, of 5mg po bid.
Pt had repeat TSH checked just prior to discharge but this was still pending; this level will need to be followed up while pt is at rehab.
7.  acute renal failure - Pt's Cr on admission was 3.9.
