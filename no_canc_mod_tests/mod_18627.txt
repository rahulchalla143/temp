GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Based on mean mitral valve gradients of [**7-26**], there is likely at least moderate mitral stenosis.
Remaining exam is unchanged.
Carotid u/s and echo were performed.
She was cultured for a white count of 25, no growth to date, cxr showed small bilat effusions.
