On initial eval his GCS was 15 then shortly after 14,  later that night it dropped to 11 and there was question of whether or not he would require intubation for some periods of apnea and altered resp pattern.
A stat head CT was done which showed blossoming of bifrontal contusions.
The following morning his mental exam greatly improved.
On initial CT he was noted to have an occipital fracture that extended to the jugular foramen on the right.
An MRI MRA ruled out dissection.
He later was started on keppra as his dilantin levels were very difficult to maintain in therapeutic levels.
Blood cultures are still pending but the fever is no longer.
He should remain on keppra till follow up in 6weeks with CT scan with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
