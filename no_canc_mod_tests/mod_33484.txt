Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2108-8-4**] 4:17 AM Final Report SUPINE CHEST X-RAY PERFORMED AT 5:00 A.M.: Tracheostomy tube is seen in the upper mediastinum 4.4 cm above the carina.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-4**]:  Interval increase in caliber of mediastinal vasculature suggests that some of the new interstitial abnormality in the left lower lung is asymmetric edema, but there is more consolidation at the left lung base and was present previously, concerning for new pneumonia.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and pulsed Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed on the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins.

His Head CT showed large IPH right deep basal ganglia.
On [**7-29**], his Head CT revealed no progression of right basal ganglia hematoma with preexisting 6 mm left midline shift and new small subarachnoid hemorrhage in a left paramedian frontal sulcus.He unserwent an angiogram which was negative.
On [**7-31**], He went to the OR for a Decompressive right hemi-craniectomy for his intracranial hemorrhage, post-operatively he was given Mannitol 25 mg q 8 hours, his post-operative Head CT was consistent with improvement in leftward midline shift and decreased dilation of the left lateral ventricle.
On [**8-1**], the patients Head Ct was consistent with no significant change since the prior examination, persistent midline shift with approximately 5 mm of deviation towards the left, stable intracranial and intraventricular hemorrhage and unchanged edema surrounding the area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
He spiked a temperature of 102.3.
On [**8-6**], overnight pt spike a temperature of 102.3 and was pancultured and a chest x-ray revealed increased opacities in the lower lobes r>l.
A sputum culture was obtained and sent for culture.
Urine cx was negative.
Formal video swallow was not performed as of this time.
