A prior echocardiogram showed an EF of 30 to 35% with moderate LV systolic dysfunction with 3+ MR and 2+ AR.
In the Emergency Department and EKG was taken, which showed ST elevation in the septal anterior leads.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities:  No edema and dorsalis pedis are palpable bilaterally.
EKG:  In atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 127, normal axis, and normal intervals.
LABORATORY:  WBC 9.5; hematocrit 44.2, platelets 198.
Chem-7: Sodium 136; potassium 3.7; chloride 98; bicarb 27; BUN 13, creatinine 0.9; glucose 177; LDL 114; CK 326; troponin 20; MB 40; INR 3.4.
LAD 99% after D-1.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 107933**] is an 87 year-old woman with a prior history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with no prior coronary artery disease presenting with angina, EKG changes and troponin higher than 2.0 consistent with septal anterior acute myocardial infarction.
She could not be taken to cardiac catheterization immediately because of her elevated INR.
She was initially treated with Vitamin K po and subcutaneous to bring down her INR to a point where cardiac catheterization could be safely performed.
Events of unstable angina prompted the team to take the patient to cardiac catheterization even though the INR had not yet achieved the goal value of 1.6.
After cardiac catheterization the patient underwent successful cardioversion and normal sinus rhythm.
A chest x-ray was taken which showed increased vascular marking and encephalization consistent with pulmonary edema.
The patient was treated with morphine nitro drip and lasix to which she responded with an urine output of 1200 cc in four hours with complete resolution of the shortness of breath.
Her oxygen saturation never dropped lower than 97% on six liters of oxygen.
At the time of presentation her INR was excessively elevated at 3.4.
On the day of discharge her INR level was higher than 2.0.
