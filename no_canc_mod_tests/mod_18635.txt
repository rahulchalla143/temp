Given the lobar location of the hemorrhage, an underlying lesion is strongly suspected but not demonstrated on the current study and therefore a followup study is recommended.
Followup study is recommended.
Otherwise no evidence of acute intrathoracic process  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 39 yo man with history of DM, HTN, unknown other PMHx, who presents from work with acute onset HA and aphasia, found on head CT OSH to have left temporal lobar hemorrhage (about 2cm x 2cm x 1.5cm, but cannot fully measure given quality of OSH films), transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up.
Patient was managed conservatory, with close monitoring/neuro checks and tight BP control.
#1 Left temporal lobe hemorrhage Repeat head CT [**11-30**] was unchanged.
MRI with contrast with hemorrhage revealed similar to the CT findings and additionally, showed faint enhancement in right basal ganglia, left cerebral penduncle consistent with developmental venous anomalies.
At these studies, we could not identify underline pathology of this current hemorrhage.
Cardiac enzymes x3 were negative.
Lipid panel showed high TG 183 (LDL47, TC 120).
