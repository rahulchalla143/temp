CT C-spine [**2155-9-28**]: 1.
Evaluation of the ligaments and the cord is better obtained with an MRI.
Sclerotic appearance of C5 and C6 vertebral bodies, with slight anterior wedging of C5, likely degenerative in nature.
CT Head [**2155-9-28**]: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or abnormality of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter differentiation.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2155-9-28**]: 1.

CT Chest [**2155-9-29**]: 1)Small pockets of subcutaneous air in the anterior thoracic wall bilaterally of indeterminate origin with no obvious esophageal or tracheal perforation and a patulous esophagus which contains fluid.
5)T1 sclerosis with deformity of the superior endplate is of undetermined chronicity, reference to the CT spine [**9-28**] recommended.
Esophagram [**2155-9-29**]: There is no evidence of leak or stricture in the evaluated part of the esophagus (from the thoracic inlet to the GE junction).
Microbiology: Blood cultures [**2155-9-29**] - no growth to date  Sputum culture [**2155-10-1**]: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2155-10-1**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.

Sputum cultures were negative.
