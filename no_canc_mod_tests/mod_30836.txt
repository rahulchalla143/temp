LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
GENERAL CMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 1 iv injection of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline at rest.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 931**] is an 87 year old gentleman with afib, history of stroke (CVA), GI bleed, aortic stenosis, iron deficiency anemia who presented to an OSH status post fall and was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for aortic valve replacement.
# AORTIC STENOSIS: Severe aortic stenosis with valve area 0.8 and peak gradient 4.2 m/s.
With diuresis, the patient's breathing improved, and his oxygen was gradually weaned to 2L (home requirement for years).
# Hypernatremia: When he was NPO for one day, his sodium increased from 144 to 151.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # ANEMIA: Blood work prior to transfer reveals hematocrit of 27.4 and remained stable during admission.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please continue to provide ongoing care focused on comfort to include: oral care and observed feedings, possible antibiotics as needed for symptomatic pneumonias, pain control, symptom control such as diuresis, secretion management or nausea/constipation.
