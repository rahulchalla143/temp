CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis ([**8-24**]):  CHEST: There is extensive consolidation of the bilateral lower lobes, markedly progressed when compared with [**2188-4-17**] consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.
ABDOMEN: Evaluation of abdominal viscera is limited by lack of intravenous contrast.
CT Head ([**8-24**]): FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
Chest xray [**2188-8-24**]: 6 am FINDINGS: Single portable chest radiograph excluding left lung base from view demonstrates endotracheal tube with tip positioned 5 cm above the carina.
Diffuse multifocal patchy opacities and Kerley B lines are identified throughout both lungs in presence of enlarged cardiac silhouette and small left pleural effusion.
Chest xray [**2188-8-24**]: 6 pm IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2188-8-24**] at 6:10 a.m.:   Pulmonary edema has improved since [**8-24**]; residual consolidation as show on yesterday's Torso CT is probably widespread aspiration pneumonia.
The CT did not show cavities or bronchiectasis.
Chest xray [**2188-8-25**]: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient after extubation.
Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to [**2188-8-24**].

Aspiration pneumonitis:  Patient had a history of emesis, likely associated with acute food poisoning/viral gastritis that has since self-resolved, with evidence of lung consolidation on CT chest.
Serial chest x-rays showed interval improvements in parenchymal consolidations.
Urine Legionella Ag was negative, endotracheal sputum gram stain and cultures from admission showed >25 polys and <10 epithelial cells per field with 1+ yeast, and grew rare commensal respiratory flora.
Blood cultures remain pending but have shown no growth to date.
CXR and chest CT showed mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
BNP was elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 28490**], and he had signs of pitting edema (per MICU notes, pt was 25 lbs over dry weight).
Renal consult recommended to continue holding valsartan since his SBPs were 100s-110s, and recommended PCP to restart valsartan once his SBPs have stabilized to baseline.
# Anemia: Pt's hematocrit dropped from 34 on admission (baseline 31-35) to 25-27 on [**2188-8-25**] and was stable ever since (29 on discharge).
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Reticulocyte index was <2% suggesting an additional chronic hypoproliferative component.
His tacrolimus level was low at 3.1 on admission, and his dosing was adjusted per Renal Transplant recommendations, to 1 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1-2 days.
#) Hyperkalemia: On admission pt's K was 5.4, normalizing to 4.8 one day later, but increased back to 5.4 on discharge.
His INR on admission was 1.4.
Coumadin was re-started at 1.5 mg daily when his hct remained stable on [**2188-8-26**].
His INR rose to 2.2 but was 1.5 on discharge, so his warfarin was increased to 3 mg daily.
His EKGs throughout hospital course were unchanged from baseline, and his cardiac enzymes were negative x3.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ***Voice message left with pt's wife [**Doctor First Name **] for him to report on Friday [**2188-8-29**] for INR check.
Please follow-up INR and modify pt's warfarin regimen accordingly.
***Voice message left with pt's wife [**Doctor First Name **] for him to report on Friday [**2188-8-29**] for CBC check.
***Please recheck blood pressure and consider re-starting valsartan for pt's heart failure.
***Please continue to monitor pt's electrolytes (in particular, potassium and Cre).
