His skin was noted to be warm and his BP was low at 78/palp.
On arrival to the ED, his BP was 78/42 and his O2 sats were 86% on 2L nc and 100% on NRB.
Cx (blood and urine) were drawn, CXR was performed, and he was then given CTX, vanco and flagyl.
Despite the IVF, his BP dropped to 74/49 and attempts at a central line were made.
Levophed was titrated up to keep MAP >60.
He went for a CT a/p with contrast which did not show a source of infection (showed fecal impaction, cholelithiasis w/o cholecystitis, and degenerative disease of his hip).
He was disimpacted and had a BM, which was noted to be brown but guaiac positive.
He had a bedside cardiac U/S performed which did not show any appreciable pericardial effusion.

CT CHEST ANGIO: There are aortic vascular calcifications; however, the aorta is not dilated.
CT CHEST BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: There is a small right thyroid lobe nodule.
Limited views of the abdomen are notable for markedly arthrosclerotic splenic artery.
Large dilated gallbladder filled with high-density material consistent in appearance with the ultrasound examination of the same day.
5mm left upper lobe lung nodule; in the absence of known malignancy, noncontrast chest CT can be obtained in 12 months to ensure stability.
RUQ ultrasound: [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 73 year old man adm with sepsis, with abdominal pain, with gallstones on abd CT REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: pls evaluate for cholecystitis.
Further evaluation when clinically warranted is recommended.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2186-10-7**] 2:02 AM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: RP bleed?
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with multiplanar reformations was reviewed.
Evaluation of the upper abdomen is limited secondary to arm overlying the abdomen.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is marked fecal impaction with the rectum distended with stool measuring 15 x 13 cm in axial cross section.
Bilateral renal hypodensities, not fully characterized, including a 1.5cm lesion in the right lower pole.
[**10-7**] Echo Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2186-10-7**]    PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Congestive heart failure.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 75% (nl >=55%)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Other causes of tachycardia considered included cardiac related (no prior EKG here, has RBBB), adrenal insufficiency, and hypovolemia.
He required levophed for his first several hours of stay in order to keep his blood pressure up.
The patient had one UA that appeared to show infection in the ED, but his follow-up urine cultures were negative for growth.
Blood cultures showed no growth.
As part of the patient's workup he received a CT scan of his torso which demonstrated no obvious source of infection.
Lung nodule: CT of the torso demonstrated a 5mm left upper lobe lung nodule, which could be followed up with a repeat CT in 12 months.
