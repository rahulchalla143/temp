The patient had been found by [**Hospital6 407**] on the morning of admission confused, with shortness of breath, and an oxygen saturation of 79% on room air.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had recently been admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] a few days before with a workup for subacute renal failure.
The patient's creatinine peaked around 4.1, and at discharge was 2.9.
This was in response to a white blood cell count of 8.4, potassium of 6.1, and a blood urea nitrogen of 54, and creatinine of 2.6.
Morbid obesity, weight of greater than 400 pounds.
Cor pulmonale; echocardiogram in [**2188-1-12**] showed an ejection fraction of greater than 50%.
Dobutamine MIBI on [**2187-3-30**] showed no defects.
Renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 0.7 up until [**2187-9-12**], and since then has been 2 to 4.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed a temperature of 98, pulse of 100, blood pressure of 164/90, respiratory rate of 20, satting 96% on 50% face mask.
On neck examination unable to assess.
Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission with a complete blood count that showed a white blood cell count of 8.4, hematocrit of 31.2, platelets of 187 (with 78% neutrophils, 1% basophils, 12% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, and 5% eosinophils).
Chem-7 revealed the following:  Sodium of 143, potassium of 6.1, chloride of 105, bicarbonate of 30, blood urea nitrogen of 64, creatinine of 2.6, blood sugar of 95.
Digoxin level of 2.3.
Urinalysis showed the following:  Specific gravity of 1.025, large blood, 30 protein, moderate leukocyte esterase, negative nitrites, 6 to 10 white blood cells, many bacteria.
Lactate of 1.1, A-gradient of 15.5.
Arterial blood gas on 50% face mask was the following:  pH of 7.18, PCO2 of 88, PO2 of 231.
Urine culture from [**2188-4-4**] showed Klebsiella sensitive only to imipenem with 10,000 colony-forming units.
Urine culture from [**4-8**] was pending.
Sputum from [**3-29**] showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in rare colonies.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray was limited, but no definite congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram showed low voltages, rate of 110, with atrial abnormalities, far right axis deviation.
This was compared to an electrocardiogram from [**2188-3-23**].
CT of the abdomen and pelvis in [**3-15**] showed moderate ascites.
She underwent paracentesis on [**2188-3-25**] which showed no spontaneous bacterial peritonitis by white blood cells or culture.
Chest x-ray, lack of fever, and lack of leukocytosis suggested that there was not an infectious component.
At that time DC cardioversion was considered, but Ms. [**Known lastname 34727**] blood pressure improved.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER:  Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 6.5, hematocrit of 28.7, platelets of 171.
Chem-7 showed the following:  Sodium of 142, potassium of 5.2, chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 30, blood urea nitrogen of 67, creatinine of 2.7, blood sugar of 110.
Calcium of 8.3, phosphate of 5.8, magnesium of 1.9.
Urine culture from [**4-9**] did eventually grow out 100,000 Klebsiella pneumoniae which was sensitive only to imipenem.
Nasal swab from [**2188-3-25**], showed positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Temperature of 96.3, pulse of 89 (in atrial flutter), blood pressure of 104/62, respiratory rate of 27, satting 88% to 97% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Cardiovascular examination showed a regular rate, irregularly rhythm.
The goal at that time was for an INR of greater than 2.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone and liver function tests were recently checked and were within normal limits with the exception of a subclinical hypothyroidism.
Strict ins-and-outs were requested, and oxygen was weaned as tolerated.
In the intervening days after being transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, her creatinine and blood urea nitrogen continued to rise; likely secondary to prerenal picture including hypovolemia and possible congestive heart failure.
Urine electrolytes had been obtained prior to a Renal consultation which showed a urea of 26, which likely indicated prerenal state.
Urinalysis was also obtained which showed many bloody/brown casts.
She will require placement of a hemodialysis catheter and transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for hemodynamic monitoring and continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was treated for hyperkalemia on admission with a potassium of 6.1.
Potassium was carefully monitored over the next few days.
On [**2188-4-17**], potassium was found to be 5.5, and she was given Kayexalate 30 g with good affect.
HEMATOLOGY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 34727**] hematocrit on admission was 30.2, and trended down to 28.7.
Transfusion parameters were for a hematocrit of less than 27.
Cultures from [**2188-4-4**] and [**2188-4-9**] showed two strains of Klebsiella which were imipenem sensitive.
She will be transferred at this time to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring and continuous venovenous hemofiltration/hemodialysis.
