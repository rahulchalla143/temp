She had encouraged her husband to seek and evaluation for his shortness of breath earlier, but the patient refused.
In the Emergency Department, his vital signs revealed a temperature of 100.2, heart rate was 128, respiratory rate was 40, and blood pressure was 146/86.
A chest x-ray was done and showed no evidence of pneumonia of congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiograms were done showing no evidence of active ischemia.
Initial blood gas at that time was 7.2/67/93.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (with the last pulmonary function tests in [**2184-6-3**] revealing an FEV1 of 0.64 (which is 21% of predicted value), an FVC of 2.27 (which is 48% of predicted value), and an FEV1:FVC ratio of 28 (which is 43% of predicted value).
His last echocardiogram in [**2182-3-7**] revealed a normal ejection fraction of greater than 55%, right ventricular hypertrophy, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination, his vital signs revealed temperature was 100.2, heart rate was 138, blood pressure was 148/64, respiratory rate was 36, and oxygen saturation was 100% on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure.
His head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination was notable for pupils which were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Pulmonary examination was notable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination was notable for tachycardia with an irregular rhythm.
Abdominal examination showed a nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory values in the Emergency Department revealed his white blood cell count was 7.8, his hematocrit was 39.9, and platelets were 222.
His Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 130, potassium was 5.1, chloride was 95, bicarbonate was 24, blood urea nitrogen was 22, creatinine was 1.7, and blood glucose was 135.
Coagulations revealed prothrombin time was 20.8, partial thromboplastin time was 35.1, and INR was 2.9.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed hyperinflation with no focal infiltrates and no pleural effusions.
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 115 with left axis deviation.
Blood gas again revealed hypercarbia, and the patient was reintubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to increasing oral secretions in the setting of progressive sedation.
His rate was initially managed with intravenous Lopressor with good control.
HYPERTENSIVE ISSUES:  The patient's blood pressure was initially managed with beta blockade alone; however, several days into the admission, the patient remained persistently hypertensive with systolic blood pressures ranging in the 160s to 170s and was subsequently started on captopril with improvement of his systolic blood pressures.
RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was admitted in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.7 (with his baseline being 1.1 to 1.4).
Additionally, the patient had hyperkalemia with a potassium of 5.1.
