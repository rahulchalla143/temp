Blood Culture: [**3-24**]  Staph, coag negative [**3-26**]  Staph, coag negative; gram positive rods (thought most likely contaminant and not treated).
Images: EKG ([**2126-3-24**]): sinus rhythm, normal EKG, rate 83, PR 142, QRS 96, QT/QTc 354/393 .
CTA Chest w&w/o recon ([**2126-3-24**]): No evidence of acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
CT Head w/o contrast ([**2126-3-24**]): No hemorrhage or mass effect.
Portable CXR ([**2126-3-24**]):  No acute pulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course/Assessment/Plan: Patient is a 50 year old woman with a history of SLE, PUD, and recently diagnosed diabetes, but on no medical therapy, who presented to the ED with a blood sugar of 700 and an anion gap acidosis of 22.
1) Diabetic ketoacidosis: Patient presented with an anion gap acidosis of 22 and qa finger stick of 700.
She had no elevation of cardiac enzymes and no EKG changes.
-Infection was the most likely trigger, considering she did have a urine culture positive for E.coli.
CXR did not reveal any evidence of pneumonia.
2) Urinary Tract Infection and questionable bacteremia: Initially, the patient had no signs or symptoms to suggest infection; however, blood cultures on [**2126-3-24**] grew 1/2 bottles of coag neg staph and urine cx revealed E.coli >100,000.
She was afebrile with WBC 6.4.
Both blood cx and urine cx were repeated on [**2126-3-26**].
Urine culture remained positive for E.coli 10,000-100,000.
The blood culture again grew coag negative staph and gm positive rods.
There was concern for bacteremia, so sensitivities were sent for this culture and the previously positive culture to see if they were of the same morphology, with the plan to treat as if bacteremia if they had the same sensitivities.
She continued to remain afebrile and with WBC <6 for remainder of hospital stay.
Repeat cultures were sent every day.
By [**3-30**], all subsequent cultures had been negative, and the original cultures were growing too slowly to do sensitivities.
It was felt that the low virulence of the original bacteria and lack of subsequent positive cultures indicated that both positive blood cultures were contaminants, and she was not felt to need TTE to rule out endocarditis.
3) Diabetes: Her picture was in some ways atypical for DKA because of older age of this patient and lack of serum ketones.
Anti-GAD and anti-islet cell antibody tests were sent to clarify type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
-She received bed-side teaching about how to take her blood sugars and give herself insulin injections.
She was adept at measuring her blood sugar, injecting the insulin, and using the insulin sliding scale.
5) Hypertension: Patient was prehypertensive in the ED, and her blood pressure remained in the 130-140s here.
Lancets & Blood Glucose Strips     Combo Pack Sig: One (1) lancets Miscellaneous four times a day: Use to check finger sticks before every meal.

Your blood sugar was 700, and you were admitted to the ICU.
-Your blood pressure was elevated, and you have been started on a new medication, Lisinopril 5mg, which you need to take once every day.
You will need to check your blood sugars before each meal and give yourself insulin shots according to the scale you have been given before each meal.
-You also have an dermatology appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on Februar 14, [**2126**] at 10:15am.
