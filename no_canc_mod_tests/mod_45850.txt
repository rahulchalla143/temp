He was then found to be in asystole which converted spontaneously to atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate of 150.
Patient was found to have a pulse and was started on lidocaine and Lopressor.
A STAT echocardiogram was performed and showed an ejection fraction of 20% with global hypokinesis.
A repeat echocardiogram revealed global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 15%.
Chest x-ray done showed question of a right upper lobe density.
Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital6 5442**] for further evaluation and management.
On further interview, the patient revealed that he had been in his usual state of health although had noted indigestion the night before presentation.
Of note, the patient had a PA catheter placed in the outside hospital Intensive Care Unit which showed a central venous pressure of 23 and right ventricular pressure of 46/23, a PA pressure of 52/30 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 28.
His cardiac output was 5.4.
He had an SVR of 1007.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient had a pulse of 94.
Blood pressure of 113/69.
Respiratory rate of 15 and an oxygen saturation of 100% on pressure support ventilation of [**9-9**] breathing at a rate of 15, taking volumes of 600 and 50% FIO2.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination revealed extraocular movements intact.
Neck examination revealed no lymphadenopathy and jugular venous distention that was hard to assess.
Cardiac exam revealed regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 and no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary exam revealed lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal exam revealed a belly that was soft, nontender, nondistended with normal bowel sounds.
Extremity exam revealed 1+ pitting edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY FINDINGS:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 12.1 with a hematocrit of 44.9 and platelets of 265,000.
His creatinine was 1.4.
Patient had an ALT of 114 and an AST of 100.
TSH was 2.79.
Initial CK was 106 with a troponin I of 0.
Another electrocardiogram from the outside hospital revealed normal sinus rhythm at 75, normal axis, [**Doctor Last Name 7491**], and T wave flattening in III and aVL.
His electrocardiogram post cardioversion was quite unremarkable and did not suggest structural heart disease, however, the patient did undergo coronary catheterization which revealed elevated left-sided pressures but clean coronary arteries.
From a myocardium standpoint, the patient had globally depressed ejection fraction at the outside hospital initially requiring inotropic support for cardiogenic shock.
Dopamine was easily weaned off and the patient was diuresed to lower his left-sided filling pressures with a goal PAD of less than 18.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed to reevaluate the patient's function.
Cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronaries, elevated right and left-sided pressures, right atrium pressure of 17, PA systolic of 49, pulmonary capillary wedge of 31, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 35 and cardiac output of 7.5.
He will need pulmonary function tests checked as an outpatient.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as an outpatient for INR checks and for continued management of his dilated cardiomyopathy.
Hepatitis serologies were sent off at the outside hospital.
Review of these results revealed negative serologies for hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.  Repeat of the patient's LFTs on the day of discharge showed no abnormal.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged with follow-up appointments with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on [**Last Name (LF) 3032**], [**4-28**] at 4:30 p.m. at which point he will have his INR checked.
