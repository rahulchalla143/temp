HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old man who has no prior history of coronary artery disease who had an abnormal EKG during a routine physical exam prompting a further workup echo that revealed an ejection fraction of 40 percent.
An ETT done on [**2161-9-25**] was stopped secondary to EKG changes with ST depressions in the inferior leads and inferoseptal hypokinesis as well as chest heaviness.
MIBI at that time showed an ejection fraction of 36 percent.
Catheterization done on [**2161-10-2**] showed an ejection fraction of 43 percent with inferior hypokinesis and mid right coronary artery 100 percent lesion, proximal left anterior descending 85 percent lesion, diagonal with an 85 percent lesion, and obtuse marginal with an 80 percent lesion.
Vital signs:  Heart rate 76, blood pressure 140/82, respiratory rate 20.
Pulses:  2 plus radials bilaterally, 2 plus dorsalis pedis, 1 plus posterior tibial bilaterally, right femoral 1 plus, left femoral 2 plus.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6, hematocrit 37, platelets 185, PT is 13.8, PTT 33.7, INR 1.2, sodium 130, potassium 4.0, chloride 100, CO2 22, BUN 21, creatinine 0.9, glucose 135, ALT 21, AST 17, alkaline phosphatase 57, amylase 100, total bilirubin 0.6, albumin 4.0.
Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Urinalysis at that time was negative.
EKG:  Sinus rhythm at a rate of 80, Q waves in II, III, and F, flipped Ts in II, III, F, V5 and 6.
He had a mean arterial pressure of 74 with a CVP of 5.
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his operative day only requiring Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support.
At this time the patient's physical exam is as follows:  Temperature 97, heart rate 83 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 100/60, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 96 percent on room air, weight today 74.9, preoperatively 75.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 9, hematocrit 26.7, platelets 179, sodium 138, potassium 3.9, chloride 100, CO2 29, BUN 25, creatinine 1.1, glucose 104.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
