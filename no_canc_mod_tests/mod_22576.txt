Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: multiple bilateral EVD placements and removals  History of Present Illness: 82yo M usually mentally sharp arrived at ED OSH w/ son and daughter who reported increasing confusion today.Initial INR 2.2 patient received FFP& Vitamin K to reverse.Patient intubated in OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
GCS 10 intially then 3.Head CT showed intraventricular bleed in 3rd, 4th, and right lateral ventricles.

EKG showed pt was in atrial fibrillation.
CTA showed 1.
Follow-up CT showed Interval placement of left frontal approach intraventricular catheter, which terminates in the left lateral ventricle, near the intraventricular foramen.
AM CT showed Interval mild increase in degree of ventricular dilatation compared to the study of one day prior.
Bilateral EVD's were placed (after removing the previous right EVD).
Follow- up CT showed 1.
HD3 Head CT showed 1) Stable appearance of bifrontal approach intraventricular catheters with interval decrease in size of left lateral ventricle.
Neuro exam remained unchanged.
HD4 CTA showed 1.
CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Sputum and blood cx showed no growth.
Blood cultures grew staph coag neg.
HD5 Head CT showed No significant interval change compared to the study of one day prior.
BIlateral CSF cultures were sent showing no growth.
Sputum cs grew GNR (Non-pseudomonas).
Urine and blood cultures were negative.
Catheter tip and bilateral CSF cx were negative.
CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Sodium was noted to be falling from 137 to 132.
Bilateral lower extremity dopplers showed no evidence of DVT.
Blood culture cont to grow staph coag neg, and sputum cx cont to grow non-pseudomonal GNR.
HD9 Neuro exam continued to deteriorate.
MRI showed Normal MRA of the skull base/circle of [**Location (un) 431**] levels.
The left EVD was then left open to drainage at 20cm above the tragus overnight, while the right EVD remained clamped.
HD11 Pt continued to spike fever 102.4, wbc decreased to 7.0.
Blood, urine, catheter and CSF cx were negative.
Head CT showed Increased size of the lateral and third ventricles since the CT scan of [**2166-10-5**], and possibly slightly increased lateral ventricular size since [**2166-10-8**].
Head CT showed Increased size of the ventricles, compared to recent previous studies.
HD14 Neuro exam improved.
Transfused 1 unit pRBCs for Hct 27.7.
Sodium was improved on 3%NaCl drip.
CXR showed Improving left lower lobe atelectasis.
Head CT showed Both studies show extensive quantities of fluid within the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses with additional opacification seen within the mastoid sinuses, along with tiny air fluid levels in the latter locale.
Head CT showed No interval change in the size of the bifrontal intraparenchymal hemorrhages or the degree of hydrocephalus.
EVD was placed for worsening hydrocephalus seen on previous CTs and to evaluate patients response.
