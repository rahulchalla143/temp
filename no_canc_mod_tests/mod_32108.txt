He was being treated for his cellulitis at [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital when he was found down in his urine and stool, and had a temp of 106.
An LP showed 300 RBC, no WBC.
An EEG was performed (read still pending).
Blood cultures at OSH grew [**12-19**] + GPC (staph epidermidis), and he was therefore switched to vanco/zosyn on [**1-20**].
OSH cultures were negative for CSF growth from LP, HSV PCR was negative.
HIV viral load was negative, EBV/CMV IgG +, IgM -.
His fevers and leukocytosis resolved on antibiotics.
He also had diarrhea, and stool studies were sent.
Physical Exam: Tc: 97.1, Tm: 98.7, BP: 120/80 (120-126/70-80), P: 68 (68-74), RR: 18, O2 sats: 98% RA, FS 111-132 Gen: Morbidly obese, alert, talkative, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, anicteric sclera Neck: thick, difficult anatomy, RIJ intact CV: RRR, nl S1 S1 no M/G/R Resp: CTAB Abd: + BS, obese, soft, NT Ext: RLE with diffuse erythema, swelling, mild skin breakdown, however looks improved from original line drawing of borders on skin.
Pertinent Results: IMAGING  CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**2151-1-20**]: The consolidation noted in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe does not have the typical appearance of atelectasis and might represent superimposed aspiration/pneumonia.
LENIS [**2151-1-20**]: Neg for DVT  EEG [**2151-1-21**]: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the marked suppression of the background with bursts of generalized slowing and prominent beta activity.
CXR [**2151-1-23**]: Has been placement of a right IJ central venous catheter with its lead tip in the mid to distal SVC.
Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
CXR [**2151-1-25**]: The right internal jugular line was removed.
ECHO [**2151-1-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CXR Portable AP [**2151-2-1**]: The right PICC line tip is at the junction of the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
There is a faint opacity in the right lower lung which appears new compared to the prior study and may represent developing pneumonia, although note is made that the technique of the exam is suboptimal, thus reevaluation with PA and lateral radiograph is recommended for precise evaluation of this area.
CXR AP and Lateral [**2151-2-1**]:  In comparison with the study of [**2-1**], there is no change.
Initially he received antibiotics for suspected meningitis (ceftriaxone, vanc, ampicillin, acyclovir), however the CSF from the OSH showed WBC=0, cultures negative including negative HSV PCR of the CSF.
His antibiotics were then changed to vancomycin & zosyn on [**1-20**], with resolution of his leukocytosis and clinical improvement - his mental status quickly returned to baseline and his fever resolved after the abx were started.
Blood cultures at OSH grew [**12-19**] + GPC (staph epidermidis).
His EEG showed no signs of epileptic activity.
There was no further growth from blood cultures.
A TTE Echo was done and no valvular vegetations suggestive of endocarditis were seen (results above).
A CXR (PA & LAT) showed no evidence of PNA.
His blood cx remained NGTD, and were sampled from both his PICC and his peripheral IV.
A UA on [**2-1**] showed moderate blood, 38 RBCs, trace protein, and no evidence of infection (no elevated WBC, no bacteria/yeast).
A rectal exam was done [**2-1**] to r/o prostatitis, and his prostate was not  tender on exam.
Follow-up CXRs showed no signs of pneumonia.
# RLE Cellulitis/Bacteremia: Blood cultures from [**Hospital 11373**] grew Staph epidermidis; its most likely source was his RLE cellulitis.
His cellulitis continued to improve and he completed a 14 day course of vancomycin in the hospital, as insurance would not cover outpatient iv antibiotics.
# Hyperglycemia: During the patient's stay in the ICU, his blood glucose was very difficult to control, likely due to the steroids he initially received, his bacteremia, and underlying insulin resistance.
Once his infection improved, he remained off insulin with well-controlled blood sugars < 150.
Pt refused starting HCTZ 25 mg QD, and will instead have his BPs followed by his PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) **].
A peripheral blood smear reviewed by hematopathology showed mature PMNs and normal lymphocytes, with no immature forms.
His EBV & CMV serologies were c/w a prior infection, however his IgM was negative for both & his CMV VL was negative.
Follow-up  was arranged for pt to see his PCP and consider repeat CT in [**2-21**] weeks as an outpatient.
# Transaminitis: CT scan showed fatty liver.
Pt had outpatient f/u arranged for evaluation of ?NASH with his PCP in [**State 5887**].
Please call your primary care physician or seek immediate medical attention if you notice any of the following: loss of consciousness, loss of bladder/bowel control, dizziness, fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, chest pain/pressure, palpitations, confusion, abdominal pain, weakness, or any other concerning symptoms.
Followup Instructions: Please be sure to follow-up with your [**State 5887**] primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1787**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16008**], on Friday, [**2-5**], at 2:45 pm (office number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77721**]).
Elevated liver function tests and fatty liver seen on CT scan 3.
Follow-up outpatient CT scan of abdomen to re-evaluate lymphadenopathy in [**2-21**] weeks 4.
Follow-up on your blood pressure, which was elevated during your hospitalization (consider starting a medication for this) 5.
