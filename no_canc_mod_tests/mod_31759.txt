-[**2149-9-30**] CT Pelvis: 1.
Consider chest CT followup in 12 months.
Relative paucity of bowel gas distally is seen with thin rim of air consistent with the compressed sigmoid colon from the ascites as was demonstrated on the recent CT scan of [**2149-9-30**].
-[**2149-10-11**] KUB: Severe distention of the colon, not significantly changed compared to prior examinations, most suggestive of ileus.
-[**2149-10-19**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
Consolidation in the middle lobe is slightly worse than on the previous chest radiograph from [**2149-9-9**] and there is new left lower lobe atelectasis.

At admission, a diagnostic paracentesis was performed by the ED which was not suggestive of infection.
A RUQ US was also performed which did not show any acute biliary pathology.
Serum and urine toxicologies were negative.
A CT head without contrast was performed but was substantially hampered by motion artifact.
Stool output began to pick up on lactulose regimen and mental status substantially improved.
The patient had an acute decline in mental status on the morning of [**2149-10-18**], with physical exam findings suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy, including asterixis.
With his liver and kidney functioning worsening daily, both encephalopathy and uremia became an etiologic factor in his altered mental status.
# Acute Renal Failure: Initially, the patient presented with Cr 1.9 elevated from a baseline value of 0.8.
On clinical exam the patient appeared itravascullary depleted supported by a lactate of 4.3 with decreased to 3.8 after initial fluid bolus.
Renal function was reponsive to initial fluid boluses suggesting that this was pre-renal in etiology.
Creatinine continued to trend down with fluids reaching at nadir at his baseline of 0.9 on [**9-26**].
Additionally, the differential for renal failure included abdominal compartment syndrome, given the patient's significant ascites and colonic distension.
A bladder pressure was transduced at 14-17 mmHg; elevated but nondiagnostic for compartment syndrome.
On [**11-5**], the decision was made to keep checking daily BUN and creatinine levels, to help the family know how much of the patient's mental status they could attribute to his uremia.
CT A/P was consistent with large bowel ileus with megacolon (9 cm loops) that were filled with air (see pseudoobstruction below).
# Colonic Ileus - Abdomen with tympany to percussion on exam and diarrhea concerning for obstruction.
CT A/P with megacolon (9cm) with repeat KUBs stable with possible 14cm loop of bowel.
Out of concern for partial obstruction, flex sigmoidoscopy was performed on [**10-6**]; the bowel was decompressed and reaccumulated air within several hours.
He was closely monitored with serial abdominal exams and KUBs over several weeks, with no significant change in colonic distention.
# Traumatic foley placement: As above, abdominal compartment syndome was considered on the differential for renal failure.
Large chest wall hematoma with CT suggesting component of rebleed.
The patient was guaiac negative and subsequently had a formed brown stool so it is believed that the blood was actually pooled blood from his penis that had collected in his perineum.
His coagulation studies did not show any significant change, and his hematocrit did not stabilize.
A subsequent blood transfusion caused low grade temperatures and increased work of breathing, and was stopped early.
# UTI - yeast on urine culture.
Additionally, the patient underwent several diagnostic paracenteses, which showed no evidence of any infection.
Initial HCT of 26.5 in ED which appears to be at baseline with prior levels.
Serial hematocrits were followed with a tendency to drift down and require periodic transfusions.
