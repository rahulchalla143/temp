Thalassemic trait 4.
At that time, it was decided to transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
He had a second seizure en- route and a third in [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Room.
His magnesioum level was 1.1 mg/dl.
His head CT was normal.
A CSF sample obtained by lumbar puncture showed three white blood cells, 1500 red blood cells.
Blood cultures from [**1-19**] showed coagulase negative Staphylococcus as well as coagulase negative Staphylococcus which was resistant to Cephalin.
8, hold for systolic blood pressure of less than 110 3.
Tube feeds at 50 cc/hr  ALLERGIES:  Penicillin  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission on [**1-19**], general examination revealed temperature 101.2, his temperature reached maximum of 104.1.
Blood pressure was 130/64, heart rate 131, respirations 18.
Cardiac examination was notable for regular rate and rhythm, tachycardiac to auscultation.
Neurological examination: On mental status examination the patient was drowsy, but arousable, moved eyes to name, grunting, could not tell the examiner where he was, his name or the date.
Motor examination persistent.
Reflexes, reflexes were 2+ bilaterally at biceps, triceps and brachioradialis, patella, ankle and toes downgoing on both sides.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values showed an INR of 1.5, chest x-ray showed a questionable left lower lobe atelectasis or infiltrate.
Computerized tomography scan did not show any obvious infarct or hemorrhage.
Generalized tonic clonic seizure assessment and management: -The patient was initially treated with 350 mg/die of Dilantin however, his PTN levels were repeatedly below the expected range.
On [**1-25**], he had a PTN level of 4.9 ug/dl and therfore he received an additional 600 mg bolus.
A MRI scan showed very small hemorrhages in the right frontotemporal and left parietal lobes consistent with his history of head injury.
Aortic graft/repair -Because of the  central lines infection with coagulase negative Staphylococcus and his initial fevers, the patient was started on Vancomycin and the Infectious Disease service was consulted.
On [**1-24**], his Vancomycin peak was elevated.
As per Infectious Disease recommendation, he needs to get three independent sets of blood cultures after he finishes his course of Vancomycin and will need close follow-ups because of the possibility of the aortic graft being infected is real and is of concern.
The patient is to continue to meet a target systolic blood pressure of less than 150 systolic.
Until then, the dose of Vancomycin will be adjusted according to his blood levels.
His motor exam showed Deltoids 4- on the left, 4 on the right; biceps 4 bilaterally; triceps 4 bilaterally; wrist extensors 4 bilaterally; finger extensors were 4 bilaterally; iliopsoas was 4+ bilaterally; hamstring 4 bilaterally; quadriceps 4 bilaterally; anterior tibialis was 3+ on left, none on the right; gastrocnemius was 4- on the left, none on the right; EM could not be elicited bilaterally.
All of his blood cultures subsequent to the intial positive ones are pending at this time.
His PT was 13.2, PTT was 39.0, INR was 1.2.
Magnesium was 1.6.
TIBC was 222.
Reticulocyte count 0.2, haptoglobin 266, ferritin was pending, transferrin was 171, LDH was 201, total bilirubin 0.3, iron 49.
Vancomycin peak was 57.
Blood cultures were pending.
8, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 110 3.
prn to keep blood pressure less than 150 systolic  FOLLOW UP: 1.
