Cultures were pending at the time of transfer, but the pH was noted to be 7.08.
Blood pressure has also been decreased over the last several days, requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 100.2, blood pressure 94/65, pulse 140, respiratory rate 20, pulse oximetry 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light, conjunctivae injected, sclerae anicteric.
LABORATORY DATA:   White blood count 14.6, hematocrit 26.6, platelets 277.
Sodium 143, potassium 4.6, chloride 106, bicarbonate 29, BUN 33, creatinine 0.5, glucose 148.
INR 1.3.
Calcium 7.5, phosphate 3.4, magnesium 1.8.
Right pleural effusion was notable for the following laboratory findings: 56 white blood cells, 33,625 red blood cells, protein of 3.2, glucose of 44, LDH of [**2046**], pH of 7.94, Gram stain revealing 1+ polys.
Left-sided pleural effusion notable for 384,000 red blood cells, 378 white blood cells, 55% polys, protein of 2.9, glucose of 63, LDH of 630, amylase of 11, pH of 7.50, Gram stain revealed 2+ polys.
Ultimately pleural fluid culture did grow out vancomycin-resistant enterococcus from one bottle, which was thought to be a colonizer.
The patient did not, however, present with frank evidence of congestive heart failure during this hospitalization, though with an echocardiogram that showed no change from prior.
Regarding other Infectious Disease issues, the patient's stool was sent for C. difficile, which was negative.
Blood was positive for cryptococcal antigen, and the patient was continued on his fluconazole.
Blood cultures, both bacterial and mycolytic cultures, were negative.
Sputum cultures taken early in this hospitalization grew out multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas, as has been colonized in the past.
The organism was not cultured from the pleural fluid, and the pleural fluid analysis was not entirely consistent with an infectious etiology.
The patient's chest x-ray revealed pulmonary infiltrates thought to reflect prior amiodarone toxicity vs. new ventilator associated or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
These cultures remained negative.
The patient was initiated on an ACE inhibitor, which he seemed to tolerate well.
Regarding his history of congestive heart failure, the patient had a recent echocardiogram revealing ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
The patient had a repeat echocardiogram during this hospitalization, which again showed ejection fraction greater than 55%, abnormal septal motion consistent with a right ventricular pressure overload, 1+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient, however, did not have any clear evidence of acute congestive heart failure compromising his oxygenation during this hospitalization.
He did receive a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit bumped appropriately and remained relatively stable.
Given the fact that he had been revascularized, it was considered essential to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 for cardio-protective reasons.
He was noted to have persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase  and elevated GGT, although the rest of his liver function tests were within normal limits.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient remained largely euvolemic.
These effusions, however, were evaluated toward the end of his hospitalization and found to be stable.
His electrolytes were aggressively repleted during this hospitalization.
He remained on tube feeds per his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, and these were at goal.
Ventilatory dependence 6.
Increased alkaline phosphatase 8.
Captopril 6.25 mg per gastrostomy tube three times a day; hold for systolic blood pressure less than 90 13.
