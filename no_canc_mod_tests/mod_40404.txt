A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.

CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2124-2-29**]):       NEGATIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
IMAGING: CT NECK [**2-23**]: 1.
If further characterization is needed, an MRI with contrast can be performed.
CXR [**2-23**]: There is a right lower lobe faint opacity, likely representing atelectasis.
CT CHEST: 1.
Mediastinal and lower neck fluid appears similar compared to prior study of 1 day earlier without evidence for new large fluid collection.
CT NECK: 1.
CT NECK: 1.
Overall, there has been little interval change in comparison to prior study with stable retropharyngeal fluid and stable edema of the epiglottis, left aryepiglottic fold, and supraglottic soft tissues, narrowing the airway.
MRV/MRA NECK:  In comparison with the prior neck CT dated [**2-28**], [**2123**], there are relatively stable diffuse fluid collections on the left side of the neck, with tissue enhancement in the left carotid space and posterior cervical and paraspinal spaces as described in detail above.
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY PRIOR TO FLOOR TRANSFER PER MEDICINE TEAM (NO SUMMARY AVAILABLE FROM TICU): 29 yo F with PMH idiopathic neutropenia who presented with neck swelling and pain after sore throat and constitutional symptoms, found to have infection and fluid collections in deep neck spaces (retropharyngeal and carotid sheath spaces).
repeat imaging the evening [**2124-2-28**] showed significant improvement in fluid collections and ENT thought pt could continue to be managed with drains and abx (no further OR) unless clinical picture changed.
Her WBC count ranged 0.6 - 1.6 during TICU course.
u/a neg and blood cx neg at the time of spike.
MRI obtained to try to eval for jugular venous clot in setting of fever noted above but only showed sluggish flow and could not definitely rule it out.
Pt had also had previous CT's of neck that did not show clot.
