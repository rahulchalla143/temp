EKG was unchanged compared to baseline and without ischemic changes.
Labs were significant for BNP 3077 (baseline 800), INR 9.5, Cr 1.2 (baseline), lactate 4.0.
CXR showed interstitial edema and bilateral pleural effusions.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-12-20**], the degree of AR and pulmonary hypertension detected has decreased   Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old woman with history of MVR on coumadin, dCHF (EF 55%), and COPD on 3L NC who presents to the ED from pulmonology clinic with significant hypoxia with exertion (73% on 3L NC).
Echo was performed which showed well positioned mitral valve and a small decrease in her pulmonary hypertension.
Systolic fraction at 55%, suggesting her sx are still from diastolic dysfunction with perhaps some right sided heart failure as well.
Her weight on day of discharge was 291 lbs, after having received only lasix 120 mg po daily; if patient watches her salt and water intake, this dose of lasix appears to be sufficient for her.
creatinine 1.2 on discharge  # MVR/Supratherapeutic INR: Patient s/p MVR [**Hospital3 9642**] [**2182**] for severe MR. INR 9.5 on presentation.
She will have INR checked in a few days by [**Year (4 digits) 269**].
# HTN:  Her blood pressures were markedly elevated when she arrived, and this was likely secondary to her volume overload.
Her bps on last day of hospitalization were well controlled on her home toprol dose.
Most recent cardiac catheterization [**2186-12-19**] with no evidence of flow limiting lesions and patent RCA stents.
# Self neglect - Patient has missed various medical appointments, and was admitted after missing doses of lasix and having INR of 9.
In addition, you had a sleep study during this admission.
