On exam she has neglect of the left and is flacid on the left.
Her INR was 2.7 so she was reversed with factor 9 in the ED.
Her exam remained stable during this hospitalization despite her CT scans showing some expansion of her ICH from the OSH to her scan here.
# Cardiovascular: we maintained an SBP < 160 with PRN hydralazine as needed, however, pt was able to maintain these blood pressures without any intervention and did not require hydralazine.
We stopped her premarin to prevent any future clotting risk.
# Pulmonary: pt's CXR showed a possibly enlarged mediastinum so we got a CT of her chest, which did not show any abnormalities, and therefore was likely related to the positioning of her CXR.
# FEN: Pt was initially NPO, and on S&S exam she passed for regular diet so we allowed her to eat with 1:1 supervision given her inattention to her L side.
MRI scheduled for pt in 8 weeks ([**2105-4-8**]) to better determine source of the bleed.
