CT Torso ([**2191-3-3**])- IMPRESSION: 1.
2.8 cm right ovarian cyst, abnormal in postmenopausal female, and not seen on prior CT from [**2179**].
RUQ U/S- 1.
1.9 cm measuring echogenic lesion in the posterior right lobe of the liver which was not visualized on the CT of [**2191-3-3**].
This likely represents a hemangioma, however, MRI of the liver is warranted for further workup.
Knee X-ray ([**2191-3-5**])- Three views of the left knee demonstrate mild medial and lateral compartmental osteoarthritis with chondrocalcinosis.
MRCP ([**2191-3-7**])- 1.
Incomplete study prematurely terminated at the patient's request.
Clinical correlation with symptoms and LFT values recommended, and an ERCP can be obtained for further evaluation.
No correlate identified to suspected echogenic lesion of the right hepatic lobe on ultrasound [**2191-3-4**].
C diff negative x1.
Stool cultures were negative.
GI initially recommended MRCP but study was limited by pain.
A cardiac etiology was thought unlikely, given normal EKG, no tele events, no murmurs on exam, no signs of LV dysfunction on stress MIBI from [**2181**].
We ask that her PCP recheck [**Name Initial (PRE) **] BP and HR on [**2191-3-18**].
Infectious work-up was unrevealing.
#) Anemia with macrocytosis: HCT down to 28 on ICU Day 1, down from baseline 32 on admission.
[**Month (only) 116**] be [**2-1**] folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiency, given history of nightly, if moderate, EtOH intake and possibly poor diet, though pt has had normal B12 and folate in past.
MCV of 98 on discharge.
#) Pancreatic mass: Bile duct dilatation seen on CT but LFTs normal.
Aspirate taken- did not show signs of infection or crystal arthritis.
X-rays showed osteoarthritis.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 400 unit Capsule Sig: 2.5 Capsules PO once a day.
Calcium 600 + D(3) 600-400 mg-unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
The gastroenterologist team evaluated you and performed an MRCP followed by an endoscopic ultrasound, which did not show any pancreatic mass.
Your symptoms improved while here and your remained hemodynamically stable.
