Other past medical history is abbreviated due to the fact that the patient presented acutely ill.  On Emergency Room arrival his temperature was 99.3, blood pressure 82/42, heart rate 133, breathing 96% on room air and overall he was sluggish.
He, however, denied chest pain, abdominal pain, pelvic pain as well as any nausea.
He spiked to 104.2 and initial ABG was done and was 7.29/39/132 on a non rebreather.
Last catheterization in [**2171**] revealed two vessel disease.
Temperature 103.4, heart rate 131, blood pressure 79/49.
EKG tachycardic, likely sinus tachycardia at 133, normal axis, right bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray with bibasilar infiltrate vs atelectasis.
LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory data, white count 3.3, hematocrit 44.7, platelet count 258,000, differential 41% polys, 22% bands, 10% monos, 1% basophils, 2 metas.
Urinalysis was greater than 300 protein, trace ketones, otherwise negative.
Chemistries, sodium 143, potassium 5.6, hemolyzed repeat 3.5, chloride 105, CO2 18, BUN 31, creatinine 2.6, glucose 150, anion gap 21.
First CK 331, troponin negative.
Serum tox and urine tox negative.
His respiratory status worsened and he was intubated on [**2185-7-21**] and abdominal CT was obtained that revealed an SBO, right middle lobe, right lower lobe and left lower lobe consolidation.
In Intensive Care Unit he required four pressors to maintain his blood pressure including Neo, Levo, Dopa and Vasopressin.
He had an exploratory laparotomy on [**2185-7-22**] after serial CT showed evidence of an SBO.
Perioperatively the patient had a troponin leak with a CK bump thought to be related to demand ischemia in the setting of overwhelming sepsis and causing him to have an MI.
His lines were changed and coag negative staph grew from his right IJ line on [**2185-7-26**].
However, they returned a couple of days later and A line was pulled on [**2185-7-31**] and sent for culture as a potential source of his persistent fevers.
An MRI of the spine was done and was normal.
Repeat abdominal CT was negative.
Pulmonary:  He was extubated as mentioned on [**2185-7-29**] and he was able to be weaned to room air by [**2185-8-3**] with oxygen saturations in the high 90's.
An abdominal CT showed moderate right and small left pleural effusions with collapse of the left lower lobe.
This was treating an A line tip which grew out gram positive bacteria.
Echocardiogram done on [**2185-7-29**] was negative for any evidence of endocarditis.
Sputum gram stain [**7-31**] grew out gram positive cocci in pairs and [**7-31**] A line tip grew out gram positive bacteria, not speciated.
All other urine cultures and blood cultures are negative at the time of this dictation.
He had a head CT that was negative for any acute process.
An MR of his spine was negative for any epidural abscess.
Based on his own Effexor, Trazodone and Risperdal for depression, none of those psychiatric medications were started while the patient was in the hospital.
As mentioned, his echocardiogram was negative except for mild LVH.
Ejection fraction of 55%.
His troponin leak represented likely demand ischemia leading to an MI in the setting of severe sepsis and a known reversible ischemic lesion from outpatient ETT performed prior to his admission.
His CKs were elevated but then were trending down.
He will need to have an ETT done in approximately 4-6 weeks following his discharge from the hospital.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  The patient was tolerating po well and his electrolytes remained within normal limits.
Exploratory laparotomy was negative.
Stool cultures were sent for C. diff, those results are not back at the time of this dictation.
At this time there is a question of whether the diarrhea is due to Vancomycin or C. diff.
Those culture results are as mentioned, still pending.
The patient had a swallowing study evaluation due to concern over future aspiration risk.
That study was interpreted as normal and the patient was determined to be able to tolerate a regular diet including clears.
In terms of disposition, PT and OT consults were done and the patient was screened for rehabilitation.
