Normal sensory exam to light touch throughout.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed, but appears to be at least mildly reduced, with inferior-posterior hypokinesis.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-7-1**], no major change is evident, but the technically suboptimal nature of the present study precludes definitive comparison.

Initially, CVL placed in ED and CVP >20 in ED.
Urine cultures grew enterococus and e.coli.
Furthermore, her INR rose steadily and was felt also to be multifactorial from poor PO intake, worsening liver synthetic capabilities.
