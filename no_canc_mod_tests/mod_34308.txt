Placed AED-->V-Fib arrest--> defibrillated him x 1.
SBP low at 80, dopamine gtt started.
Head CT negative for bleed, chest CT negative for PE.
His cardiac enzymes were positive (trop 712, CPK 466, MBI 6.5, ALT 271, ALT 195, ABG: 7.37/36/231).
Initial EKG with Afib at 98, Lateral ST depressions, inferior Q waves; then converted to sinus rhythm 117, lateral ST depression, inferior Q waves.
BP increased to 210/140, dopamine and lidocaine discontinued.
Cardiac cath performed on the day of transfer; found to have 100% occluded RCA with collaterals, Left Main: 20% at ostium, LAD: clean, D1 50% ostial stenosis, LCx: 30% stenosis.
V gram: EF 40%, inferior wall hypo/akinesis, normal mitral valve, normal aortic root.
Vitals at OSH: HR in 60's afebrile, SBP 9o's.

Cath: [**12-24**] 1.
Limited coronary angiography demonstrated single (1) vessel coronary artery disease.
The left system was not engaged - outside hospital angiography demonstrated no severe stenosis with the distal left supplying collaterals to the right.
Final angiography  demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
TTE [**12-25**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
M with a PMH of HTN and hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH after VFib arrest and diagnostic cath demonstrated TO of RCA.
Diagnostic cath at OSH demonstrated no stenosis of LAD, 50% ostial D1, mild stenosis of mid LCx and prox occlusion of RCA.
LVgram EF 40%.
Peak CK 1700.
# Pump: LV gram as OSH demonstrated EF of 40%.
ECHO showed EF of 45% with akinesis of inferior wall and no RV involvement.
Patient to be continued on metoprolol and lisinopril as an outpatient, and should also have an echocardiogram done within 2 months time to assess his heart function.
His QT-interval have been monitored on morning ECGs and are not concerning.
Per report CT head negative for evidence of CVA.
He will need further neuro-rehabilitation.
PA and lateral CXR with RUL opacity, and sputum culture positive for heavy growth of MSSA.
Blood cultures NGTD and patient will need to finish a 10-day course of Doxycycline.
Hematocrit has remained stable with no further evidence of bleed.
# Elevated LFTs - At OSH AST 271, ALT 197.
You had a cardiac catheterization and with removal of a clot and subsequent placement of a bare metal stent in your right coronary artery.
