Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart rate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His reflexes were minimal throughout.
Coordination and gait examination was not tested.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45, platelets 258,000.
PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.
The EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and intervals.
Serum and urine toxicology was negative.
ESR was 18.
CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55 by 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to the right.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.
The patient's blood pressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep the cephalic pressure between 130-160.
The Nipride drip was then weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a nicardipine drip.
Considerations for a CTA and angiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but the patient's renal function and health status did not allow such studies to be done at the current time.
Repeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in the bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral edema with some pressure onto the brain stem.
The patient's neurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he only had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal reflexes.
Despite clinical examination that the patient is clinically brain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive treatment.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was initially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood pressure between 130-160.
He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia on the chest x-ray.
Vancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization due to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.
The patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued to rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.
Urine electrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1 which is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and prerenal.
He was subsequently given IV fluids and his creatinine improved to 1.6.
A renal ultrasound was done which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Blood cultures were obtained.
The first two sets showed one out of four blood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.
However, on day number four of hospitalization, his sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus coagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.
More blood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.
