Following initiation of imipenem, cultures cleared by [**2124-8-28**] (imipenem was continued for an estimated [**8-1**] days).
She developed post-op anemia with a nadir of Hct 24.7.
Her post-op course was complicated by acute on chronic renal failure (Cr peaking 3.0) thought [**2-26**] oliguric ATN that resolved with IVF resuscitation; post-op possible ileus vs. obstruction (documented on plain film on [**2124-9-6**]), and bile leak confirmed by subsequent CT scan and HIDA scan on 08.15-16.08.
An ERCP attempted on [**2124-9-11**] at OSH was aborted due to failure to access and repair the biliary tree.
Chest compressions were initiated, and 1mg atropine x2 and 1mg epinephrine were administered leading to return of spontaneous, palpable pulse at a rate of 160 with hypotension to the systolics 70-80's.
SBP were maintained with a neosynephrine continuous infusion.

# Cholecystectomy c/b Bile Leak: RUQ ultrasound and CT - contrast demonstrated extensive biloma.
Stenting was performed [**2124-9-15**], and the pancreatic stent was to stay in place for 1 week, and the biliary stent for 8 weeks.
Once biliary drainage dropped  to less than 10 cc/day and CT abdomen showed the biloma was much decreased in size, the biloma drain was removed (on [**9-28**]) by IR.
S/p cardiac arrest Pt was intubated and placed on AC ventilation with phenylephrine.
Repeat ECHO did not reveal R heart strain.
# Leukocytosis: This was persistent despite being on 9 days of meropenem since admission for urosepsis at OSH; sources included urine (UA+) with [**Female First Name (un) **] given her risk factors of indwelling lines/tubes; Gi processes, ARF, and long term broad spectrum antibiotics.
Repeat UA and Ucx X2 grew yeast despite being on meropenem and foley changes as well as Sputum cx and miniBAL with + yeast as well.
She had a negative CXR and urinalysis prior to discharge.
# Oliguria/acute on chronic kidney failure: Pt presented with a prerenal ARF picture with Cr 3 (from baseline 1.5) with reported ATN prior to transfer from OSH; with a high likelihood of ATN recurrence in the setting of post-op volume loss and hypotension, hypovolemia related to CHF exacerbation, and 3rd spacing [**2-26**] intraabdominal infection.
Finished r/o MI and repeat ECHO demonstrated hyperdynamic function with EF 75% and BNP elevated from transfer levels (998) to >[**Numeric Identifier 3301**].
Her magnesium and potassium levels will need to be followed as these did require some repletion.
OSH KUB raised question of SBO vs ileus and showed air fluid levels.
Repeat KUB showed no sign of obstruction.
#Sepsis due to UTI: positive blood cultures and Ucx dating from [**2124-8-23**], but remained negative here, without growth from OSH cx as of [**2124-8-28**] and without growth on cultures drawn here.
A repeat UA [**2124-9-17**] was positive with a positive yeast culture.
Orthopedic surgery was consulted, and repeat AP/lateral x-ray of right femoral head was performed.
# Anemia of chronic disease: transfused 1 unit for HCt 24- bumped to HCt on ICU day 3.
Her hematocrit remained stable at 26-30. .
She was started on verapamil for rate control and her blood pressure was well controlled on this.
CXR was negative.
Her urinalysis was positive, and she was started on ciprofloxacin on day of discharge.
Calcium 600 + D 600-400 mg-unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day.
You were started on verapamil for your blood pressure.
Weight yourself daily and if you gain greater than 3 pounds, call your doctor.
