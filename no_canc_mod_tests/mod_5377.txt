BNP and signs of volume overload were not marked, and venous pressure was slightly up.
Pulmonary hypertension, slight fluid overload were most likely, while we were mindful of unlikely pulmonary embolism (given rapid recovery and likely little reserve given his underlying physiology).
Flu swab was negative and there was little concern for CAP.
After transfer to the floor, the patient was easily transitioned back to room air with a resting oxygen saturation of 94-96%.
His dyspnea most significantly responded to diuresis, and patient was maintained on Lasix 40mg PO BID.
Repeat echo demonstrated moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
On admission his potassium was elevated and reached a peak of 8.5 despite receiving calcium and Kayexelate in the ED with no ECG changes.
He will have repeat laboratory studies on either [**2184-1-23**] or [**2184-1-24**] to evaluate his potassium level.
# dCHF: The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure based on echocardiogram and right heart cath.
It was unclear if his CHF was worse given normal BNP and lack of true desaturation.
Nonetheless, weight gain was likely fluid.
Repeat CD4 count was repeated and was found to be 588.
# Anemia: Anemia, near-leukopenia, stable and likely attributable to HIV and his other multiple medical co-morbidities.
He did reach a nadir of 24.4 though repeat HCT testing returned at 27.4.
The patient had a digital rectal exam that was hemeoccult negative.
The patient was found to have a microcytic anemia and examination of iron studies releaved the patient to be iron deficient.
He will have a repeat CBC and electrolytes on [**2184-1-23**] or [**2184-1-24**] and will be followed up by his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
The patient's creatinine was 1.5 at the time of discharge and will be checked on [**1-31**].
Outpatient Lab Work Please perform CBC and chem 7 on [**2184-1-23**] or [**2184-1-24**] and fax results to primary care physician ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3382**]).
Your hematocrit (or concentration of red blood cells in your veins) was found to be low.
You will need to have another lab test drawn on [**2184-1-23**] in order to ensure this is stable.
