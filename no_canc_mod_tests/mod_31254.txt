She was BIBA to an OSH boarded and collared where CT of the c-spine demonstrated a C1 fracture.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

IMAGING: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] ([**5-28**]): Type 2 odontoid fracture with mild anterior displacement of the C2 vertebral body in relation with the odontoid process and malalignment at the fracture site.
Fluid level noted within the sphenoid sinus.
CTA Neck ([**5-29**]): 1.
Fractures through the anterior and posterior arches of C1 as well as a type 2 dens fracture with posterior angulation of the fracture fragment and mild canal narrowing.
Continued imaging for evaluation of this region is recommended.
CT Sinus [**5-28**]: 1.
Fractures of the dens and C1 with retrolisthesis of C1 on C2 as described above.
TTE [**5-29**]:  poor technical quality.
Imaging was obtained in emergency department showing cervical spine fractures.
CT Head from OSH was negative for intracranial bleed.
Custom collar obtained [**6-5**] and this was further customized to accommodate patient's tracheostomy.
A CT Head was obtained at this time to assess for intracranial process and was again negative.
Her neuro exam was non-focal throughout admission.
ICU day 4 she was found to be anemic with no clear bleeding source, but she was transfused to a hematocrit of 30 to optimize oxygen delivery.
Her trach showed minor sanguinous secretions until discharge, easily managed with intermittent suction.
ID: Given concern for pneumonia on CT chest, she was started on Vanc/Cefepime ICU day 3.
After BAL and cultures were all negative, her antibiotics were DC'd on day 6.
Medications on Admission: prilosec 40, pravastatin 40, diovan 80, hctz 25, temazepam 30 qhs prn     Discharge Medications: 1. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution [**Month/Day/Year **]: One (1) Injection TID (3 times a day).
