Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted one day prior to surgery for further work-up do to his extensive past medical and surgical history.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
Liver/GB US showed Cholelithiasis with a stone identified in the neck.
General surgery was consulted for the cholelithiasis and following day a chest CT was performed to further evaluate hemothorax and drop in hematocrit.
CT showed a large right hemothorax and Heparin was immediately stopped.
He did have rise in his creatinine over next several days (over 3.2), evident of acute renal failure, but he kidney function improved and creatinine trended down.
H. Pylori serologies were positive and he was appropriately treated.
Repeat GB US and ABD CT on [**8-6**] and [**8-7**] showed mildly enlarged pancreas, which can be seen with early pancreatitis and cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
A ERCP was recommended to further assess the cholelithiasis with possible stone but patient refused.
Over the following week he remained stable while receiving TPN and medical management and his LFT's and Amylase and Lipase were closely watched.
