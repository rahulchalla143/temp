The patient was immediately taken for CT scan of his head which revealed no acute injury and no bleed.
CT of his cervical spine revealed fractures at C4, C6, T2, and T12, and also most significantly was his C7 fracture which appeared to be the worst which showed the vertebral body had been burst into many pieces.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis was negative.
The patient was kept on strict C-spine logroll precautions and required pressor support to keep his systolics greater than 100.
MRI of the cervical spine showed findings consistent with that of his CT scan along with significant cord damage in that area.
He slowly became more awake, and his pressure support wean continued slowly which he was tolerating well.
The patient underwent speech and swallow study which revealed that his swallowing mechanism was intact.
Due to continued spiking temperatures, the patient underwent a cardiac echocardiogram which revealed no evidence of valve vegetation.
The patient also grew one blood culture of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis; however, this presumably was the only source of infection, so a course of Vancomycin was started and completed.
For this reason, he underwent an additional bronchoscopy which revealed secretions but non-occluded airway.
He was taking tidal volumes of 650, breathing 22 times a minute.
Pulmonary exam showed coarse breath sounds bilaterally but was oxygenating well, and he was in no distress.
Extremities were edematous but warm and dry with triphasic Doppler signals and bilateral dorsalis pedis posterior tibial   pulses.
