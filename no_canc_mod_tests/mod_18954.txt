CT of head on admission showed no acute event, + for marked microvascular disease.
As part of syncope w/u he underwent cardiac cath which revealed 3VD.
During the procedure, pt developed R extremity weakness and dysarthria, MRI demonstrated multiple small cerebral and cerebeallar emboli without hemorrhage.
Repeat MRI performed on [**7-17**], heparin stopped, and placed on ASA 650mg daily.
MRI repeated [**7-22**] with progression of infarct in L frontal lobe.
Afebrile, BP 162/82, HR 104, RR 22, O2 94% on RA, 100% on 3L NC.
Physical Exam: per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1193**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6812**] VS: T 95.0 BP 150/72 HR 88 RR 12 O2 100% on 3L NC Gen: elderly white male in NAD, oriented x3.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Pulses: Right: Carotid R with old scar 2+, Femoral 1+ Popliteal 1+ DP dopplerable PT dopplerable Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 1+ Popliteal 1+ DP dopplerable PT dopplerable   Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm at 79, nl axis, borderline PR, + IVCD, + LVH, T wave inversions I, aVL.
TEE [**2183-7-17**]: mild LV dilation with evidence of inferior, inferolateral and anterolateral apical infarction, EF 25%, mild MR. .
CARDIAC CATH [**7-17**] demonstrated: LMCA - large, slightly ectacic, non-obstructive LAD - very large, wraps around apex.
LCx - a large vessel totalle occluded after OM1.
LABORATORY DATA Oupt labs [**7-30**]: WBC 10.6, HCT 32.6, Plt 253 Na 142, K 4.4, Cl 92, Co2 34, BUN 37, Cr 7.9 Gluc 226, Ca 8.4 CK 145, Trop I 2.19 -> 2.43 LDH 268, HDL 25.
ABG: 7.47/47/82 BNP > 5000 .
PT: 12.0  PTT: 22.2  INR: 1.0 .
[**7-31**]: CXR no evidence of failure .
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**8-2**] MRI/A: FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI: IMPRESSION: Foci of hyperintense signal within left centrum semiovale and in the anterior portion of the right centrum semiovale on diffusion images with corresponding T2 and FLAIR abnormalities.
Repeat diffusion study with ADC map would help for further assessment if clinically indicated.
Gadolinium-enhanced MRA or CTA would help for further assessment of the stenosis if clinically indicated.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection, no perforation and no embolisation.
He was mildly overloaded on exam and improved with HD the following morning.
CAD: pt evaluated with cardiac cath recently although no clear evidence of ischemia at that time.
We obtained baseline CE and an echo which showed function impaired by 3VD.
EKG was unchanged from prior with anterolateral persistent ST depressions and T wave inversions.
After neurology evaluated patient's MRI/A and taking into consideration patient's comorbidities and witnessed recurrence of CVA symptoms with decreased blood pressure, patient was determined by CT Surgery to be high risk for open heart surgery and the decision was made to undergo PCI.
A TEE was obtained to determine location/severity of aortic atheroma so as to guide PCI approach.
Pt was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a HCT of 29.5 before the procedure.
[**8-6**] cath revealed a mid LAD lesion of 80% and a 70% instent restenosis distal to this lesion.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection, no perforation and no embolization.
CVA: outpatient MRI showed evidence of multiple emoblic strokes.
We obtained echo and carotid ultrasounds as above.

You were taken for cardiac catheterization with revealed blockages in your major arteries.
