He had no EKG changes, but he did have an elevated Trop I at 0.88 and a BNP of 1,000.
While there he was noted to have positive cardiac enzymes, and there was concern for ACS, however he was told he was a poor catheterization candidate due to his poor kidney function (Cr 1.7).
He also had a chest CT which per his family's report was concerning for possible emphysema or intrinsic lung disease.
His CXR here again shows bilateral lower lobe patchy infiltrates and some slight suggestion of CHF.

ECHO [**3-21**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
CT chest w/o contrast also revealed CHF w/ bilateral effusions and evidence of severe emphysema.
His oxygen saturation improved to 96% on 3L NC and was breathing comfortably after diuresis.
Urine and blood cultures were both negative, and he had no evidence of pulmonary infection.
