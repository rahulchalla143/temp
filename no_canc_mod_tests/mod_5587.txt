Her anion gap closed rapidly with fluids and insulin, and she was transitioned to SQ insulin by the following morning.
She had intermittently refused fingersticks and insulin, citing that her FSG were "satisfactory."
# Sepsis from a urinary source with E. coli bacteremia Urinalysis indicative of urinary tract infection with risk factors including diabetes and straight catheterization in setting of probable neurogenic bladder.
She subsequently was afebrile with negative surveillance cultures for at least 48 hours.
Consider outpatient sleep study for OSA.
Her baseline creatinine is around 0.9 with elevation to 1.5 during hospitalization likely consistent with intrinsic process including urinary tract infection and ATN in setting of sepsis given many WBC and granular casts.
Discharge Cr was 1.2.
She will need careful monitoring of area as high risk for infection.
