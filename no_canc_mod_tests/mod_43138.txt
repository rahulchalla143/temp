Although no definitive etiology was identified, an enterococcus UTI and hepatotoxic drugs were felt to be partially responsible.
In ED, initial VS were T 98, BP 126/44, HR 72, RR 18, SpO2 98% on RA.
Initial labs were remarkable for Hct at baseline of 26, platelets of 11,000 and worsening hyponatremia to 121 from baseline of 130s.

[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21496**]/vf FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD19, CD20, FMC7, HLA-DR, Kappa, Lambda, CD45, CD23.
Further evaluation for HIT was not pursued.
Her H pylori antibody testing was positive.
Her Plt count increased to the mid 60s after receiving IVIg, and had risen to the 70s by discharge.
Variceal bleeding, portal gastropathy, and PUD were also possible.
The patient's daughter reported that she had a recent EGD that was negative for varices, but documentation of this was not obtained during the MICU stay.
Her Hct slowly trended down in the MICU, requiring multiple RBC transfusions.
An EGD was performed on [**2120-9-10**] which showed only mild esophagitis and gastritis.
# Helicobacter pylori:  Her H pylori serology was found to be positive and her EGD showed patchy gastritis and gastropathy.
Amoxicillin was avoided given the possible relationship of Augmentin with her recent thrombocytopenia.
# ESLD: Diagnostic paracentesis was negative for SBP.
She had a therapeutic tap for 4L on [**2120-9-9**] which had [**Numeric Identifier 54848**] RBCs, but only 250 WBCs and 48% polys.
# Hypertension: Her BP remained stable in 130s-140s.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw blood on [**2120-9-16**] and check CBC/diff, Chem10, PT, PTT, INR, AST, ALT, and TBili.
Your blood pressure and other vital signs remained stable, and you were transferred to the Liver service.
You received additional platelet transfusions and evaluation of your liver disease.
The bleeding stopped, and your blood counts also started increasing.
While on the Liver service, you had a therapeutic paracentesis to remove ascites fluid from your abdomen and help make you more comfortable.
You also had an upper endoscopy (EGD) to check for possible sources of bleeding in your esophagus, stomach, and the first part of the small intestine.
The endoscopy showed some inflammation of the esophagus and stomach, but no major source of bleeding.
A blood test was also sent which showed possible infection with bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, which can lead to ulcers and inflammation in the stomach.
You will need to have blood drawn for lab work prior to your visit with your PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**].
