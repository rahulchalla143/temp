In the ED, initial VS: 98.2 F, BP 131/83, HR 108, R 21, O2-sat 98% RA.
Given the visual changes, patient had an initial head CT which was negative.
Blood cultures were drawn and pending.
Neurology recommended a repeat head CT while he was in the ED, which was performed prior to transfer.
LENI's were also ordered in the ED given his h/o of R to L shunt on prior ECHO with bubble study and were negative for DVT.
An ECHO was also ordered, but not done prior to transfer.

The wide, inter-territorial distribution and uniform temporal appearance of the lesions, in this clinical context, are strongly suggestive of "watershed" infarction; an embolic etiology is less likely.
Normal MRA and MRV of the brain and MRA neck.
Repeat MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: IMPRESSION: Evolution of previously seen foci of decreased diffusion.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infections are common causes.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
EEG was negative for epileptiform activity.
He was transferred to the floor where repeat EEG again was non-epileptiform although showing nonspecific activity in the occipital area.
An MRI showed evidence for embolization; septic emboli was a possibility, however other embolic phenomena were also a possibility, given that embolization could have occured at the moment of displacement of his HD line.
Chest x-ray was unremarkable.
MRI of L spine given prior fluid collection was not suspicious for infection.
Peritoneal fluid was negative for SBP.
Repeat MRI showed continued presence of previously seen MRI but again was not necessarily consistent with septic phenomena.
