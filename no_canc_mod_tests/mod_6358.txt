On the morning of admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit ([**7-18**]), the patient became acutely short of breath with her oxygen saturation decreasing down to 55%.
An arterial blood gas was done that showed a pH of 7.17, a PCO2 of 106, and a PO2 of 108 while on nasal cannula oxygen.
An electrocardiogram at the time of this incident showed ST depressions in the inferolateral leads along with tachycardia.
Congestive heart failure (with a recent echocardiogram in [**2163-1-29**] which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 60%, 3+ mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension).
Asthma; pulmonary function tests in [**2163-5-31**] revealed an FEV1 of 35%, FVC of 34%, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of 101%; consistent with a restrictive lung pattern.
A brain computed tomography was also negative for metastasis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 72, her blood pressure was 134/60, her respiratory rate was 14, and her pulse oximetry was 98% (assist control tidal volume 400, respiratory rate 13, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, 30% FIO2).
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Neck examination revealed no jugular venous distention.
Lung examination revealed diffuse rales, soft wheezes, and good air movement throughout.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a 4/6 systolic murmur at the apex radiating to the precordium.
Extremity examination revealed 2+ edema at the ankles bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratory data on admission revealed electrolytes with a sodium of 141, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 97, bicarbonate was 39, and her blood glucose was 297.
Free calcium was 1.31.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone was 2.
Blood urea nitrogen was 22.
Creatinine was 0.5.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute, normal axis, and normal intervals.
A chest x-ray revealed severe kyphoscoliosis.
A chest x-ray showed minimal evidence of congestive heart failure.
Cardiac enzymes were checked every eight hours times three following the respiratory decompensation.
Creatine phosphokinase levels were found not to be elevated.
A Cardiology consultation was obtained, and an echocardiogram was done.
The patient was found to have no focal wall motion abnormalities, left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%, and severe 4+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient's blood pressure was controlled initially with a nitroglycerin drip during extubation on [**7-20**].
Overnight, the patient was weaned off the nitroglycerin drip and started on a course of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine as needed for blood pressure control.
As the patient is a chronic CO2 retainer, her oxygen saturations were kept in the low 90s for the remainder of her hospital stay.
Of note, on her computerized axial tomography two stable pulmonary nodules with some surrounding lymphadenopathy were noted.
All psychiatric medications; including citalopram, Ativan, and Risperdal were continued as previously prescribed to control her anxiety and fluctuating mood.
