On the morning of transfer the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 160s to 170s.
He had blood loss anemia with an hematocrit of 19 and he was in shock with a picture most consistent with sepsis.

Lungs had breath sounds somewhat coarse, clear with suctioning.
On neurological examination he moved all extremities.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count was 1.1, hematocrit 23.4, decreased from 27.4 on [**2166-6-1**].
Platelet count was 100.
Neutrophils 83.8, eosinophils 2, basos none.
Sodium was 127, potassium 5.2 hemolyzed, chloride 95, bicarbonate 18, BUN 60, creatinine 2.5, baseline 1.8, glucose 298, calcium 7.7, magnesium 1.9, phosphorous 5.5.
PT 20, PTT 72.5, INR 2.7.
Vancomycin level was 25.1.
Cardiac enzymes were CK 80, troponin less than 0.3.
Arterial blood gases were 7.45, 29, 114, 21.
Chest x-ray showed a Swan-Ganz catheter tip seen in the right main pulmonary artery.
ETT 2 cm above the carina.
Echocardiogram from [**4-10**] showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, AK anterior septum, anterior free wall, apex, moderate HK inferior septum and lateral free wall.
Catheterization on [**2166-4-9**] showed three-vessel disease with left anterior descending coronary artery 70% proximal lesion, 100% mid with collaterals from PDA.
LCX 60% lesion, RCA 80% x 2 with stent x 2 with good flow.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, rate 105, prolonged PR, left axis, poor R wave progression, less than [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression noted in the inferior leads.
AVL with Q waves, T wave inversion, new when compared to the EKG from [**2166-4-17**].
Shock:  On admission the patient had a blood pressure of 70s/30s with a temperature of 103 consistent with septic shock.
After initiation of antibiotics as well as volume repletion with blood products, he was weaned successfully off of his Levophed.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient had an ejection fraction of 25% consistent per repeat echocardiogram done.
He was started on a nitroglycerin drip with hydralazine for preload and afterload reduction.
His oxygen saturation continued to improve.
Both vancomycin and Levaquin were continued for a 14-day course with interval improvement on his chest x-ray and decreased leukocytosis.
Blood cultures remained negative while in house.
Sputum culture did grow MRSA for which he was placed on precautions.
While in house a swallow study was done and he was determined to be at a high risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Blood loss anemia:  On admission the patient's hematocrit was 24.6 and rapidly decreased to 19.6 without clear source of bleed.
He was transfused to an hematocrit greater than 30.
Hematocrit remained stable at the time of discharge.
On standing Lopressor the patient remained in sinus rhythm with a heart rate between 80 and 100.
His creatinine should be followed closely.
His sugars should be followed closely and after his new insulin requirement is determined, he should be switched to a long-acting insulin.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  As noted the patient failed video swallow study and is noted to be at a high aspiration risk.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was done which showed thickening of the gallbladder wall as well as a stone in the cystic duct.
Tube feeds - Nepro solution at 35 cc goal.
Two-liter nasal cannula titrated to oxygen saturation greater than 92%.
