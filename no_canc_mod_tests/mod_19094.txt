Additionally, on admission to OSH, he was noted to have increasing LE edema & ascites (which he has had in "moderate" amounts in past, as documented by US & CT at OSH).
His LFTs were WNL (ALT 20, AST 29, alk phos 130) as they have been in past.
Pt was transferred for further evaluation of this.
His VS were 95/52, 94, 16, 98% on 4L nasal cannula.
His most recent labs from OSH were reviewed, with INR of 1.95, plt 180, crt 2.3 and normal LFTs.
The patient underwent a 4.3L paracentesis with fluid sent for diagnostic studies (serosanguinous fluid removed).
Last cath in [**12-4**]-->stent to RPL1 and right PDA.
- Atrial fibrillation/flutter s/p ablation of flutter in [**4-1**] - s/p full EP study at oSH w/ no inducible V tach (done after pt had NSVT) -CHF w/ EF 40-45%, nml RV function (per OSH note) - H/o ascites (confirmed on prior abd u/s & CT scan per OSH notes: pt hospitalized in [**12-4**] w/ mod ascites, mod L sided effusion & small R pl effusion.
Reportedly no evidence of cirrhosis on imaging & no splenomegaly) - H/o LE edema - H/o Diabetes Mellitus - Hyperlipdemia - Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP - GERD-->reportedly confirmed w/ EGD - Lumbar disc disease - L ear hearing loss - L sided retinal vein occlusion in [**2126**] - Chronic adnemia (has had endocsopy in past--unclear results) - S/p Abd hernia repair  Social History: Married lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 3844**].
Physical Exam: VS - 98.8, 95/52, 94, 12, 97% on 4L (manual BP: L arm 94/50 & R arm 92/55; pulsus of 10mmhg) Gen: obese man, appears to be in mild distress, though answering all questions appropriately & a&o x3.
Skin: warm, dry  Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated low voltages, afib w/ average ventric response of 100bpm, LAD, poor R wave progression, TWI in aVL & flattening in I.
Stress MIBI performed on [**6-1**] at [**Hospital3 17921**] Center demonstrated: mild global hypokinesis, EF 45%, and no evidence of ischemia .
CXR (portable) [**2136-9-25**]) -- Two frontal views of the chest were obtained.
Consider CT for further evaluation.
Again this can be further characterized with a chest CT. .
TTE Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with patent LMCA.
Left vetriculography was deferred given renal insufficiency.
Hemodynamic assessment revealed near equalization of the right and left sided filling pressures.
There was discordance with respirations between RV and LV pressures consistent with contriction.

Left vetriculography was deferred given renal insufficiency.
Hemodynamic assessment revealed near equalization of the right and left sided filling pressures.
There was discordance with respirations between RV and LV pressures consistent with constriction.
Echocardiography was suggestive of infiltration and there was concern for an infiltrative process but a Heme-onc consult did not feel this was consistent with amyloidosis.
Further workup as below.
Serosanguinous ascitic fluid likely from traumatic tap, cytology was negative for malignant cells and pathology shows inflammatory cells and histiocytes.
An abdominal fat pad biopsy was not performed, and may be reconsidered as an outpatient workup.
# NSVT: pt has had long h/o this, including EP study at OSH w/o inducible VT.  No h/o syncope.
Urine lytes (fe-urea<35%) suggest pre-renal process.
Creatinine improved with diuresis, and at discharge was 1.6. .
He was not discharged on any medications since his glucose levels were near normal.
Hct in low 30s at OSH.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
