The patient had a slight bump in her cardiac enzymes from a CK of 194-293 after placement of her pacemaker, which again came down the next morning.

Her chest x-ray initially showed some opacities at bilateral bases, which may be consistent with aspiration.
Her blood pressure is now well-controlled on Lopressor 50 [**Hospital1 **], captopril 6.25 tid.
