Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
POST-CPB: On infusions of phenylephrine and epinephrine, AV pacing, preserved biventricular systlic function compared with pre-bypass, LVEF = 35-40%, MR remains mild, aortic contour normal post decannulation, no evidence of hematoma or dissection of aortic wall.
========================================= [**2129-7-8**] Head CT Scan: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, edema, mass effect, or evidence of acute infarct.
