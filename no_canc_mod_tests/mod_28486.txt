Wet Read: DXAe FRI [**2189-7-3**] 11:04 PM Thick (19 mm) rind of soft tissue around the descending aorta graft with locules of air is very worrisome for graft infection.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired images were obtained through the torso before and then immediately after the uneventful administration of 80 cc of IV Optiray contrast.
CT ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, and adrenals are grossly unremarkable.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-4-11**], the findings are similar.
The prior echo measured the ascending aorta as 4.5cm but this was likely an OVERestimation.
CTA showed 19 mm rind of soft tissue around descending aorta graft with locules of air that were worrisome for infection.
CTA: 8 weeks post-op from repeat thoracic aortic stent graft with increase in the peri- aortic soft tissue rind and perigraft pockets of air suggestive of infection  [**2189-7-4**] CT surgery-arranged for bronchoscopy and EGD to be done on [**2189-7-6**] [**7-5**] No acute events, NPO for bronchoscopy in am.
[**7-15**]: CT placed to Water seal, NTG drip weaned to off with ACE-I initiated.
The patient was discharged to rehab on POD 18 with plans to follow up with cardiology for an internal pacer, and with thoracics for a barium swallow study, and infectious disease for further anti-microbial management.
