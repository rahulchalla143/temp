On CT imaging of his abdomen, however, he was reported to have "specks" of air within his portal venous system, as well as emphysematous gastritis and inflammation of his sigmoid and descending colon.
They planned for an EGD to evaluate possible emphysematous gsatritis, though they felt he was too hypotensive (SBP still in the 80s) to tolerate this, and he is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Physical Exam: T 96.4  BP 88/44  HR 61  RR 18  Sat 100% on room air General: well-appearing, maneuvering around bed without difficulty HEENT: no scleral icterus, moist mucous membranes Neck: supple, JVP 6cm Chest: clear to auscultation throughout, though poor cooperation with exam; no wheezes/rales/ronchi CV: regular rate/rhythm, normal s1s2, II/VI systolic murmur loudest at apex Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended, normal bowel sounds, no HSM; well-healed vertical midline scar, and well-healed scar along right costal margin Extr: no edema, warm, 2+ PT pulses Neuro: alert, intermittently cooperative with exam, CN 2-12 intact Skin: no rashes or jaundice   Pertinent Results: From [**Hospital **] Hospital: WBC 4.5 (81% PMN, 11% L, 8% Mono), Hgb 15.3, Hct 43.5, MCV 96.9, Plts 105 Na 138, K 3.7, Cl 108, HCO3 21, BUN 14, Cr 1.0, Gluc 90, Ca 7.3 AST 31, ALT 33, TBili 0.6, DBili 0.2, Alk Phos 66, amylase 55, lipase 24, albumin 4.2, TProt 7.9 CK 54, TnI <0.02 PT 13.7, INR 1.32, PTT 28.1 Urinalysis: negative .
Studies: CT Abdomen ([**9-19**] at [**Hospital **] Hospital): Dependent changes in the lung bases.
Other diagnostic considerations include inflammatory bowel disease, infectious colitis and pseudomembranous colitis (under appropriate clinical setting).
If this one finding is to be confirmed without delaying overall treatment of the patient, further evaluation can be made with additional CT imaging with optimal intraluminal contrast opacification in the stomach, taken in supine (and prone) position.
ECG: Sinus rhythm at 61 bpm, left axis deviation, RBBB and LAFB, TWIs in V3.
CT Abdomen at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2142-9-20**]: Intralobar air trapping consistent with possible airways disease and/or CHF.
Recommend clinical correlation and CT chest if concern.

Surgery was consulted and felt abdominal exam and labs were un-concerning for serious abdominal pathology but repeat CT was ordered to ensure no free air, etc.
The repeat CT was essentially normal with mild colitis likely [**3-3**] gastroenteritis.
stool culture, C Diff toxin, O&P, Giardia were sent.
Given empiric antibiotics until results of CT came back and then were d/c'd.
