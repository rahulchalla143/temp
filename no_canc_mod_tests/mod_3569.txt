Head CT showed no bleed, but while in the scanner she developed afib with RVR into the 180s and then developed respiratory distress.
Her blood pressure remained consistently >170 systolic.
VS prior to transfer: HR 90s, 188/84, 26, O2 Sat 100% on [**10-31**] with 100% FiO2  On evaluation in the ICU, the patient is on BiPap.
Physical Exam: VS T 98 HR 94, RR 20, BP 176/74, 100% on bipap 10/5 Gen: Lying in bed, Bipap mask in place HEENT: Pupils round and reactive Neck: Supple, no carotid bruit CV: Irregular, faint heart sounds Lung: Clear Abd: Soft, nontender, nondistended.
Pertinent Results: [**2169-12-12**] 06:25AM BLOOD PT-21.8* PTT-33.3 INR(PT)-2.0* [**2169-12-8**] 05:50PM BLOOD proBNP-1799* [**2169-12-9**] 04:04AM BLOOD VitB12-317 Folate-17.3 [**2169-12-9**] 04:04AM BLOOD %HbA1c-5.5 eAG-111 [**2169-12-9**] 04:04AM BLOOD Triglyc-48 HDL-52 CHOL/HD-3.3 LDLcalc-108  Echocardiogram [**12-11**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
MRI of head [**12-10**]: Likely subacute infarction within the left frontal and parietal lobes, with the parietal infarcts having a small hemorrhagic component  CTA of head and neck: 1.
CT head demonstrates hypodensity in the right occipital lobe due to infarct of undetermined age.
CT perfusion does not demonstrate a definite territorial area of abnormality.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates some tortuosity of the left vertebral artery which is small in size and could be due to cervical spondylosis.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
MRI can help for further assessment to assess for acute infarct.
Transferred to neurology when MRI showed acute stroke of L frontal/parietal lobe most likely embolic given her atrial fibrillation and subtherapeutic INR.
Echocardiogram showed no evidence of thrombus or ASD/PFO.
She was initially bridged with heparin and INR was therapeutic (2.0) on the day of her discharge.
Patient needs to continue Coumadin given her Afib with goal INR between 2~3.0.
Lipid panel obtained and LDL 103 hence patient started on 20mg of Simvastatin.
TTE showed LVEF ~50%.
Hypertension: She remained with systolic blood pressure mostly 160-180, consistent with neurology recommendations.
TSH was 4.2 and the dose was not altered.
Outpatient Lab Work INR every Thursday and Monday until INR stable to titrate Coumadin dosing.
Goal INR 2~3 4.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
You arrived as code stroke but because your last well known time was unclear, you were not a candidate for blood clot [**Male First Name (un) 18701**].
You were admitted to the stroke service and MRI of head showed that you have a new left subcortical stroke (posterior limb of internal capsule) likely embolic stroke due to atrial fibrillation.
You reported that you were not taking your Coumadin because you ran out of the medication and your INR was subtherapeutic on admission.
Your ASA was also stopped on the day of your discharge to rehab because your INR was therapeutic 2.0.
You need to continue Coumadin with goal INR 2~3.
Please follow-up with your PCP and you need frequent INR monitoring to ensure that your Coumadin dose is optimal.
However, you will need frequent blood checks (INR) to ensure that your Coumadin dose is optimized.
