Hepatology also consulted, recommending preoperative ultrasound and abdominal CT scan.
The RUQ ultrasound showed normal portal venous flow and two small gallbladder polyps.
The abdominal scan was essentially unremarkable - there was no focal liver lesions, with only a small amount of perihepatic ascites.
Postoperative echo was notable for a LVEF of 20% with no mitral regurgitation or aortic insufficiency.
Bedside swallow examination showed bilateral vocal cord paralysis, diffuse pharyngeal weakness and silent aspiration.
Over several days, his native heart rate improved to the 80's.
At discharge, his oxygen saturations were 99% on room air.
Repeat bedside swallow examination showed no signs of aspiration with pureed diet.
Videofluroscopic evaluation on [**7-24**] confirmed aspiration but functional swallow was achieved with pureed/ground solids and honey thick liquids.
