HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 39 year-old gentleman with a past medical history of pulmonary sarcoidosis recently diagnosed congestive heart failure who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac hesitation due to recent symptomatic exacerbation.
TTE revealed mild right ventricle dilatation with preserved function, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, inferior and posterior wall akinesis with an EF of 20%, moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] PA systolic pressure around 15 mmHg.
On [**7-21**] the Holter showed recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia for which he had an electrophysiology study done, which was noninducible for ventricular tachycardia.
He had a cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 216**], which revealed severe biventricular failure with mild pulmonary hypertension, 2+ mitral regurgitation and normal coronary arteries.
An RV endomyocardial biopsy was negative for sarcoidosis.
He had a stress test on [**2185-2-8**] to evaluate exercise tolerance where he exercised for fifteen minutes on the Dobutamine protocol, which was then stopped for hypertension at peak exercise.
His blood pressures decreased from 112/60 to 90/64.
He was taken for a cardiac catheterization on [**2185-2-9**], which showed a PA sat prior to dobutamine was 59%.
Before Dobutamine his pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 32, PA of 41, right atrial pressure of HRV pressure 55/8, PA pressures of 55/29 with a mean of 39.
After the Dobutamine his PA pressures were 58/20 with a mean of 38.
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 25 with V wave of 40.
Pulmonary sarcoidosis diagnosed in [**2179**].
ESR was 5, base was 16.
Chest x-ray revealed stable perihilar parenchymal changes.
His last pulmonary function tests from [**2185-1-27**] was FVC 53%, FEV1 1.85, FEV1 was 1.85, FEV/FVC was 86%, total lung capacity 55%, forced 0 capacity 44%.
The patient's biopsy was negative for sarcoidosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, temperature 98.
Heart rate 97.
Blood pressure 110/70.
Respiratory rate 19.
Oxygen saturation was 93%.
Pulmonary pressure was 50/26.
Mean PA pressure was 38.
Cardiac output 5.3.
Cardiac index 2.45 on 8 mics per kilogram per minute of Dobutamine.
Weight was 90 kilograms.
Chest clear to auscultation anteriorly.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 4.4, hematocrit 39.8, platelets 303, sodium 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 101, bicarb 20, BUN 21, creatinine 0.9, PT 13.8, PTT 31.4, INR 1.3, ALT 21, AST 18, alkaline phosphatase 107, total bili 0.9.
Arterial blood gas pH 7.4, PCO2 35, PAO2 84%.
Chest x-ray revealed that he was in congestive heart failure.
He was fully diuresed to keep his PA diastolic pressure to 17 mmHg and his Dobutamine drip was fully weaned off.
Because his cardiac index remained above 2.20 and his systolic blood pressure was greater then 90 mmHg for two days a Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued.
Later on his systolic blood pressure while sitting in a chair was found to be consistently above 80 mmHg.
On the floor he did exceptionally well with stable systolic blood pressures above 80 with absolutely no shortness of breath on ambulation.
During his admission he was evaluated as stated for a cardiac transplant by the [**Hospital 4415**] congestive heart failure team, a carotid ultrasound, ankle brachial indices and 24 hour urine collection for creatinine clearance and protein were obtained for a preop workup.
Upon discharge the patient was issued a CT of his chest.
A CT scan of his chest done on [**7-21**] for evaluation by the [**Hospital1 336**] transplant team.
They also examined his recent pulmonary function tests and determined that the patient would tolerate any surgery well.
His O2 sats were well above 93% on room air by the time of discharge.
