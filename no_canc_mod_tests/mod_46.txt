Father had a history of hypertension  Physical Exam: temperature 100.8, pulse 81, blood pressure 109/71, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 100% on room air General: patient was in moderate distress, appeared acutely ill Head and neck: head atraumatic/normocephalic.
Minimal thin white discharge, right adnexal and fundal tenderness consistent with peritonitis  On discharge the patient had a well healing midline incision, as well as ostomy sites that were pink and healthy.
Her abdoment was soft and nondistended  Pertinent Results: Blood cultures negative, CMV IgG positive, CMV IgM negative, CMV DNA negative, RPR negative, Fungal culture negative, Stool negative for (camplobacter, salmonella, shigella, vibrio, yersina, ecoli 0157:H7, Cdificile, virus), HSVI/II negative, Hep B SAb positive, Hep BSAg negative, Cervical cultures negative for GC and chlamidyia, Rheumatoid factor negative, HIT negative, Cystic fibrosis negative, sickle negative, lupus anticoagulant negative, cryoglobulin negative, [**Doctor First Name **] 1:40, ANCA negative, HCG negative.
Pelvic Ultrasound [**2103-7-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Abdominal CT [**2103-7-25**]: ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a trace right pleural effusion and slight atelectasis at the right lung base.
PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST: The uterus is enlarged with multiple fibroids, some of which demonstrate calcified rims.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in evaluating bowel anatomy.
Peritoneal fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
No 2D echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis identified.+   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was initially taken emergently to the operating room for exploratory laparascopy with general surgery back up.
Despite this the patients Hematocrit rose from 41.3 to 52, and her WBC rose form 12.9 to 39.7.
On post op day 2, the patient was taken back for a reexploration given that the patient had the hemodynamics above, and the patients abdominal exam worsened.
The infectious disease and rheumatology services were consulted and were intimately involved, and the results of the studies they suggested are listed above.
The patients hemodynamic status improved, although the patient remained tachycardic and intermittently febrile, although cultures remained negative and the patient remained on broad spectrum antibiotics.
On post operative days 5 and 3, the patient had an echocardiogram to rule out an embolic source for possible mesenteric ischemia, and a HIT panel was sent for decreased platelets.
