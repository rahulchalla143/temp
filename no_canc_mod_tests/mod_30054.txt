She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for asa desensitization and cath here showed resolution of the RCA clot.
Her discharge weight was 137 pounds.
She took her BP and it was in the 70's.
The blood pressure was thought to be an error since her BP was in the 60s and 70's when she was evaluated.
EKG had some deeper STD laterally but cardiac markers were not significantly elevated.
She reports that her weight was about 135 pounds at home.

Hypodensities in the right corona radiata are non-specific, but could be due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
CT SINUS IMPRESSION: 1.
[**3-22**] CT TORSO IMPRESSION: 1.
Right renal hypodensity, which is incompletely characterized, but cystic.
Further imaging with renal ultrasound is recommended.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-3-17**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced.
CXR [**2105-3-24**] IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of left pleural effusion with complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Renal U/S [**2105-3-25**] IMPRESSION: 1.6-cm mid right renal cyst corresponds to hypodensity seen on CT.  CXR [**2105-3-26**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a new ICD extending to the general area of the apex of the right ventricle.

Baseline SBP 80s-90s.
EKG on admission showed lateral STD consistent with strain in setting of hypotension.
Cardiac markers were not significantly elevated and were flat.
Chronic systolic CHF: Pt has severe systolic CHF with EF 20% with severe LV dilation, severe MR, and pulm htn.
They initially recommended repeat echo in 3 months but then recommended ICD as discussed below given development of complete heart block.
Complete Heart Block: Pt developed complete heart block on [**3-26**] with hypotension SBPs 60s and HR 50s.
Block resolved spontaneously after approximately 10-15 minutes and BP subsequently improved to SBPs 90s.
UTI: Pt had complaints of dysuria with enteroccocus on urine cx sensitive to vanco and macrobid and ampicillin.
repeat CBC with diff should be checked as outpatient and workup could be further pursued as outpt.

Your blood pressure was low and your kidneys were dehydrated.
We stopped your heart medicines and diuretics and your blood pressure and kidney function improved.
