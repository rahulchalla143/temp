She was intubated w/o event (ABG 7.44/44/431/31) and received epinephrine x2, atropine x2, and bicarb x1 with establishment of a palpable pulse.
12 lead EKG was obtained and revealed ST elevations in aVR and V1-V3 with reciprocal ST depressions in V5 and V6.
Repeat EKGs revealed persistence of ST elevations and plans were made to take her to cath.
Stat CXR revealed improvement in her pleural effusions from earlier today, but still showed persistent hilar fullness.
Labs were drawn and showed elevated cardiac enzymes.
Pt is a poor surgical candidate currently and with this in mind, and with the knowledge of the patient's wishes, the family did not want to proceed with cardiac catheterization.
