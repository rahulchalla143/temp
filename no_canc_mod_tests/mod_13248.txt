Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination with bilateral carotid bruits.
Abdominal examination is soft, nontender, nondistended.
Peripheral vascular pulses show left foot with rubrous cyanotic changes the toes to the ankle.
Pulse examination shows on the right a Dopplerable femoral with absent pulses below the femoral artery.
He had serial coagulations monitored for goal PTT of 60 to 80.
The patient underwent on [**2164-1-31**] an arteriogram which showed a patent right femoral anterior tibial bypass graft with a proximal common femoral artery 90% stenosis.
His beta blockade was increased to maintain a goal heart rate between 60 and 70.
A PMIBI was done which showed moderate fixed deficit with global hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 27%.
His CKs and troponins were cycled.
Initial CK was 312 with an MB of 11.
TSH was done which was normal at 4.4 with free thyroid T4 of 0.9.
An echocardiogram was repeated.
The patient had a poor response of his hematocrit post transfusion.
An upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done which demonstrated esophageal erosions with duodenitis and gastritis.
The patient was then transferred to the VICU for continued care and serial hematocrits were monitored with stabilization of his hematocrit.
The outside cardiac catheterization studies were reviewed and they felt the patient was not a candidate for any cardiac intervention.
His total CK was 194 with an MB of 17 and a troponin of .51.
The second set showed a total CK of 1553 with a troponin of 22.
On [**2-22**] the patient's INR was noted to be 7.7.
A repeat showed progressive elevation in his INR.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin for a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
Patient's INR should be monitored on a daily basis until he in a steady therapeutic state with a INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
If patient's INR drops below 2 IV heparin should be begun for a total PTT 60 to 80.
