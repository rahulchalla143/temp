Micro: Urine culture ([**2120-12-27**]): 1000 CFU gram negative rods Blood cultures ([**2120-12-27**] x2, [**2120-12-28**]): No growth to date.
EKG ([**2120-12-27**]): Sinus bradycardia with a single atrial premature beat.
CXR ([**2120-12-27**]): Markedly limited study.
CT head ([**2120-12-27**]): Prelim read, no intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
CT chest non-contrast ([**2120-12-27**]): Prelim read, no pericardial effusion, no caliber change of aorta or intramural hematoma to suggest dissection.
Renal ultrasound ([**2120-12-27**]): No hydronephrosis.
TTE ([**2120-12-28**]): The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Dilated and hypokinetic RV with at least moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-8-22**], the findings are similar.
The right ventricular size was described as normal on the prior study but it was dilated then also.
Due to desaturation to 76% with respiratory rate = of 33 and findings of hypercarbia to pCO2 76, the patient was intubated by fiberoptic bronchoscope.
The patient was noted to have stable massive cardiomegaly on CXR with possible volume overload.
Initial [**Year (4 digits) **] were remarkable for ARF (Cr 4.2), BNP >6000 and 2 sets of negative cardiac enzymes (trop 0.02 and unchanged).
UA was noteworthy only for some blood in the setting of foley placement and blood and urine cultures were sent and without significant growth.
Head and chest CT without contrast were largely unremarkable with some bibasilar atelectasis and an ill-defined lingular opacity.
Echocardiogram confirmed severe right heart failure with associated mitral and tricuspid regurg.
Due to the profound, life-threatening and recurrent nature of [**Last Name **] problem she was evaluated by thoracic surgery team for consideration of surgical tracheostomy.
The patient was scheduled for short-term outpatient pulm follow-up for further evaluation of her problems and for further consideration on the utility of a trach.
Subsequent telemetry monitoring revealed no further bradycardic episodes.
The patient maintained good blood pressure control off of these agents.
The patient had a BNP of >6000 up from past measurements in the 4000 range on a recent admission.
Acute renal failure with a Cr of 4.3 was noted on admission.
Renal ultrasound was negative for hydronephrosis.
