A head CT was done at this time revealing a new left cerebellar bleed.
The patient rapidly deteriorated at [**Hospital3 417**] with posturing on examination and he was immediately intubated to maintain airway support and sent via [**Location (un) **] to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Room.
The patient was seen by Neurosurgery in the Emergency Room where a repeat head CT showed a large left cerebellar hemorrhage with rupture into the subdural space and upward herniation of the vermis resulting in effacement of the fourth ventricle.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.7, pulse 70, pressure 100/43, respiratory rate 12, saturating 100 percent on the ventilator.
Right corneal reflex greater than left corneal reflex.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 7.1, crit 30.6, platelets 222,000.
Chemistry panel revealed a sodium of 140, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, bicarbonate 24, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6, glucose 126, calcium 9.3, phosphorus 3.4, magnesium 1.7.
Coagulations:  INR of 2.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Head CT on admission revealed a large left cerebellar bleed with upper herniation of the vermis and effacement of the fourth ventricle.
Additionally, the patient was on Coumadin for DVT and PE and was found to have an INR of 2.4 on admission.
The decision after discussion with the chief resident and attending was to take the patient immediately to the Operating Room for decompression of the cerebellar bleed and he was started on an A-line, transfused FFP to reduce his INR and he was given factor VII preoperatively for stabilization of his anticoagulative state.
The patient's neurologic examination after the surgery off sedation was minimally improved from his preoperative examination with minimal responsiveness, and a small amount of flexion of the left upper extremity and lower extremities withdrawal to pain.
On postoperative day number one, the patient received a CTA of his head which revealed no aneurysm or subdural bleed.
On postoperative day number two, the patient was found to be less responsive than his previous examination and was found to have pinpoint pupils.
He was given Narcan without any success and he was sent for a stat head CT which showed no interval change in the size of his cerebellar hemorrhage.
His medical management was optimized and he was given FFP as necessary to keep his INR less than 1.3, his crit was maintained above 30 and his platelets were maintained above 100.
On postoperative day number four, the patient's neurologic status was found to be unchanged and he was sent for an MRI which revealed no change in the prior cerebellar hemorrhage and upward tentorial herniation, without any evidence of new infarctions or hemorrhage.
On postoperative day number five, the patient received an EEG which revealed no evidence of seizures and diffuse slowing, left greater than right.
At this time, it was clear that on the patient's neurological examination, the patient was largely unresponsive without following commands, and that he would intermittently demonstrate the ability to flex his left upper extremity to 45 degrees during painful stimulus as well as intermittent withdrawal to pain, left greater than right in the lower extremities.
