STUDIES CTA chest [**2117-10-22**] CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Coronary artery calcifications are noted.
Limited views of the upper abdomen reveal bilateral renal cysts, with a right renal cyst measuring up to 2.8 cm and a left renal cyst measuring up to 2.5 cm.
A close interval follow-up Chest CT in 3 months is recommended given a history of prostate cancer, as these nodules may reflect metastases.
TEE [**10-23**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Emergency study by fellow.
TEE/cardioversion [**10-25**] The left atrium is dilated.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
Cardiac Catheterization [**10-25**] 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated central aortic pressures 141/83 with a mean of 100 mmHg.
Chest Xray pa and lateral [**10-26**] INDICATION: Recent NSTEMI, evaluation before CABG surgery.
Carotid Series [**10-26**] Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 57/15, 60/12, 62/23, cm/sec.
CCA peak systolic velocity is 65 cm/sec.
ECA peak systolic velocity is 91 cm/sec.
On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 76/17, 56/18, 42/17, cm/sec.
CCA peak systolic velocity is 92 cm/sec.
ECA peak systolic velocity is 76 cm/sec.
Venous Duplex [**10-26**] Preop Patent bilateral greater saphenous veins.
Cardiac MRI [**10-26**] CMR demonstrated 20% likelihood of recovery of function of anterolateral wall and 60% likelihood of recovery of anterior wall.
A CTA upon admission was negative for a pulmonary embolism however numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules were discovered.
A repeat CT scan was recommended in 3 months for further evaluation.
A cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
A viability study demonstrated 20% likelihood of recovery of function of anterolateral wall and 60% likelihood of recovery of anterior wall.
He was worked-up by the ccradiac surgical service in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid ultrasound which showed less then 40% stenosis bilaterally.
