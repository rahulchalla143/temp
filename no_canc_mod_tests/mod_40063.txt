CT scan performed there reportedly showed hyperdense R MCA and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Sensory: 1 9.
Language: 0 10.
Dysarthria: 1 11.
Left visual and sensory hemineglect- he could not identify his own hand; however he is aware that he has no feeling in his left arm.
Sensory: Absent light touch LUE.
There was light touch sensation present in LLE, but this extinguished.
His SBPs ranged 140s-160s.

CT PERFUSION: There is a large area of increased transit time in the right MCA distribution, extending into the anterior cerebral and posterior cerebral distributions.
Initial exam was notable for left neglect (visual and sensory), right gaze preference (but full EOMs), left facial weakness, left hemiplegia, and left sensory defecits greater in upper than lower extremity.
CTA showed complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at the bifurcation with reconstitution distally as well as an occluded right middle cerebral artery.
His nausea was aggressively managed and he was encouraged to eat.
We assessed his treatable stroke risk factors: LDL 127, HbA1C 6.1%.
His systolic BP goal should be 140-160 for one week (until [**2175-11-27**]), then decreased to <140 systolic likely with the aid of further BP medications.
