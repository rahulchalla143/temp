Slight prominence of the ventricles and temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], unchanged since prior examination may reflect mild degree of hydrocephalus.
MRI Head [**7-3**]  IMPRESSION:  1.
Blood products noted in the left lateral ventricle, in close proximity to the region of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
Consider close followup CT study to evaluate interval change or progression.
Close followup MRI study can be considered, to assess interval change, as these are very tiny in size limiting more accurate assessment.
These were not as pronounced on previous study and may represent areas of ischemia/infarct.
She did show signs of clinical vasospasm although radiographic studies were negative.
Remained on Nimodipine for vasospasm prophylaxis, she did require multiple pressors to sustain SBP and Nimodipine was d/c'd overnight.
On [**6-28**] her exam was non-focal and her nimodipine was restarted and HHH therapy was liberalized.
Her exam would wax and wane and all radiographic studys were negative for spasm and infarct.
EEG was negative for seizure.
On [**7-7**] she was noted to have new L sided weakness in whcih studies were negative for cause although strength appears symmetrical at this time.
