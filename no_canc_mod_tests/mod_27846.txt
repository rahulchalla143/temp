Visualized portions of the hip and sacroiliac joint spaces are unremarkable.
Curvilinear calcific density projecting over the left lower quadrant is not readily identified on subsequent pelvic and hip radiographs and is of uncertain clinical significance.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-7**], there is still substantial opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis and pleural effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-9-30**], the left ventricular regional dysfunction is more evident and the left ventricular systolic function is worse.
She was found to be in complete heart block with an escape of 40.
She had a permenant pacemaker ([**Company 1543**]) placed on [**11-10**], and her epicardial wires were pulled.
She was seen by ortho for a fall while in the ICU, and plain films of her hips and L-spine were taken, there was no evidence of fracture.
