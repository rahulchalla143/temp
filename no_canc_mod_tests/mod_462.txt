CT scan of chest demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli, he was oxygenating well on nasal cannula, an intravenous Heparin drip was started and he was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring.
No IV drug use   Family History: HTN and DM  Physical Exam: Upon admission:  98.2  102  137/89  19  98% room air  Gen: No active distress Head/Eyes: Pupils equal and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact ENT: Oropharynx clear, no jugular venous distention Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally CV: Regular rate, tachycardic Abd: Soft, non-distended, +colostomy with yellow/green output, no cellulitis, drain at right lower quadrant MSK: Full range of motion 5/5 strength upper and lower extremities, deep tendon reflexes 2+ bilateral, senstations intact Neuro: CN's III-XII intact Psych: Alert and oriented to time, place, and person  Pertinent Results: Abdominal and Pelvic CT scan [**3-29**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT chest [**3-29**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Chest X-ray [**3-29**]: IMPRESSION: New focal airspace process at the left lung base, associated with low lung volumes and prominence of the central pulmonary arteries, which may reflect pulmonary hypertension.
This likely at least in part, corresponds to the organized pulmonary infarct in the left lower lobe, in the setting of massive acute pulmonary embolism  Echo [**3-29**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
CT abscessogram [**3-31**]: FINDINGS: The contrast appears to have filled some of the small bowel indicating communication of the pigtail with the small bowel.

An echo demonstrated his EF > 75% with hyperdynamic left ventricular function and normal right ventricular size and motion, bilateral lower extremity ultrasound was negative for a thrombus.
HD 3, his chest pain and shortness of breath had improved, he was transferred to an in-patient nursing unit, his diet was advanced, he had good pain control with oral Dilaudid, the Heparin drip was adjusted with serial PTT's goal between 60 and 80; an abscessogram demonstrated the catheter to be in communication with the small bowel with resolution of fluid collections.
HD 5, he was made NPO for 48 hrs, Octreotide was started, and the drain was removed.
HD 13, his INR was therapeutic at 2.1, the Heparin drip was discontinued, he was tolerating a regular diet, remained afebrile, ambulating independently, and oxygenating well on room air.
He was discharged home in good condition on [**4-10**], with instructions to have his PT and INR checked twice a week starting [**4-11**], and close follow-up with a PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3380**] [**4-12**].
