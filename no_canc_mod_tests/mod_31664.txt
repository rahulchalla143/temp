Echocardiogram recently showing 1+ MR.  EKG with incomplete right bundle branch block.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.7, pulse 106, blood pressure 112/66, respiratory rate 24, saturations 97% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  When transferred to the [**Hospital1 139**] Service, white blood cell count was 19.3, hematocrit 32.5, platelet count 179,000, sodium 141, potassium 4.7, chloride 111, bicarbonate 20, BUN 18, creatinine 0.6, glucose 122.
Radiographic data:  CT angiogram showed no evidence of PE, three nodules noted in the right apex, and some colonic diverticulosis.
The patient's white blood cell count was elevated likely secondary to Prednisone.
Additionally, the patient's EKG showed T-wave inversions in V1 through V6.
The stress echocardiogram showed anterior abnormalities (please see stress report for further details).
Due to this atrial abnormality, the patient had cardiac catheterization, which showed mild-to-moderate CAD with no flow-limiting lesions; normal filling pressures, left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%.
