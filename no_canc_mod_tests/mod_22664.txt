[**4-12**] abdominal u/s: 1.
[**2186-4-14**] Transjugular Liver Biopsy:  [**2186-4-14**] Therapeutic paracentesis (IR): IMPRESSION: Successful diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound-guided paracentesis yielding 3 liters of ascites.
[**2186-4-17**] Portable abdominal x-ray: IMPRESSION: A single view of the abdomen is marked as having been obtained with the patient upright.
[**2186-4-19**] Portable CXR for PICC placement: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-18**], there has been placement of a right subclavian PICC line that appears to extend to the cavoatrial junction or slightly further into the right atrium.
EGD [**4-16**]: Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions 3 cords of grade III varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
Discharge labs: Notable for: WBC 14.3 Hct 27.1 Plt 85 INR 2.1 Fibrino 155 (on [**4-21**]) Cr 0.6 Na 133 K 3.1 AST 147 ALT 61 LDH 296 Alk Phos 121 TBili 9.1 Albumin 2.9 .
Iron stain shows no iron deposition.
Viral causes are a concern as well, including hepatitis A (ate oysters), B, C; these viral studies were all negative.
To try to differentiate, primarily between auto-immune hepatitis and etoh cirrhosis, a transjugular liver biopsy was performed by radiology on [**4-14**] after FFP was given.
Patient had been set to have 1 unit of blood transfused due to lower Hct post liver biopsy (slowly drifted down so was 5 points lower than prior to liver biopsy), so transfusion was given as scheduled.
Repeat Hct check was scheduled.
Also has diarrhea, c.diff & stool culture negative, u/a negative, CXR clear.
Repeat u/a with only 2 RBC.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with liver disease = hepatitis; studies performed to determine the cause (including lab tests, imaging, and liver biopsy) found the liver disease to be due to alcoholic cirrhosis and alcoholic liver disease / hepatitis.
Afterwards, your bleeding stopped and your blood levels stabilized.
He will need to check your blood levels (CBC), sodium level, chemistry panel, kidney function, and liver function.
You also will need a repeat endoscopy (EGD) by your gastroenterologist within the next week, to examine the esophageal blood vessels that bled while you were hospitalized, and to likely band the blood vessels again to prevent further bleeding.
You should also attend the following appointment with a new liver doctor (hepatologist) at [**Hospital1 18**]: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2424**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2422**] Date/Time:[**2186-8-1**] at 9:30 AM.
