She has had progressive worsening of her mixed outflow gradient plus valvular aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation over the past few years with a peak aortic gradient of 105, a mean of 48, on transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2153-5-1**], and left ventricular outflow gradient of 74 by catheterization on [**2153-5-23**].
Her cardiac history includes a catheterization in [**2146**] which showed no significant coronary artery disease outside of a 50% lesion at the origin of D1 and mild narrowing of the left circumflex at its origin.
A repeat catheterization in [**2152-11-28**], showed  a peak to peak left ventricular outflow gradient of 53 at rest and 70 with Valsalva maneuver.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2153-5-1**], showed an ejection fraction of 65% along with moderate to severe aortic stenosis, one plus aortic regurgitation, four plus mitral regurgitation and three plus tricuspid regurgitation with a gradient across the aortic valve of 48.
Catheterization on [**2153-5-23**], showed severe resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 74; the gradient increased to 166 with Dobutamine.
Aortic valve stenosis itself was mild with a peak gradient of 28, a mean of 23.
Post-procedure, the left ventricular outflow gradient at rest and with provocation decreased markedlyto 20 with an aortic valve gradient unchanged at 25 mmHg, compared with pre- procedure.
There were no complications of the procedure and the patient was transferred to Cardiac Care Unit for close hemodynamic monitoring and post myocardial infarction precautions.
Benign breast biopsy times two.
ALLERGIES:   Vancomycin which causes itching and a rash; cephalosporins which cause GI upset; Clindamycin which causes a rash as well as lip swelling and penicillin which causes swelling.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her physical examination on admission to the Cardiac Care Unit was temperature 96.9 F.; blood pressure 135/70; heart rate 70 which was ventricular paced; respiratory rate 17; oxygen saturation was 99% on two liters nasal cannula.
Her jugular venous pressure was not elevated.
On chest examination, her lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly (the patient was laying flat due to femoral catheter in place).
On extremity examination, her right groin site was without oozing, hematoma or bruits.
She had two plus dorsalis pedis and posterior pulses bilaterally.
On neurological examination she was alert and oriented times three.
LABORATORY VALUES:  Her white blood cell count was 7.8, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 30, and platelets were 222.
Her sodium was 127, potassium 3.2, chloride 92, bicarbonate 28, BUN 17, creatinine 0.6 and glucose of 150.
EKG done pre-procedure showed ventricular paced with a rate of 70 beats per minute and a left bundle branch block morphology.
Post-procedure, the EKG showed again ventricular pacing with a rate at 76 beats per minute and left bundle branch block.
Surveillance cardiac enzymes showed a peak CPK of 2240 on [**6-6**], at 04:00 p.m., a few hours after the procedure.
The peak index was 19.2.
Cardiac enzymes trended downward for the remainder of the hospital course.
She was restarted on her outpatient anti-hypertensives which included Cozaar, Verapamil and Hydrochlorothiazide.
Her DDD pacemaker was capturing well with a heart rate of 70.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:   On presentation, the patient was hyponatremic and hyperkalemic, which was partly at baseline, but additionally attributed to a large amount of intravenous fluids received in the catheterization laboratory.
She was switched to normal saline with supplementation of potassium and her electrolytes normalized.
Hematocrits remained stable at 33.0 throughout hospital course which was at patient's baseline.
A fasting lipid panel was run on the day of discharge which showed a triglyceride of 93, HDL 63, LDL 64, for which the patient will follow-up with primary care physician.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy status post alcohol ablation, AND stable mild valvular aortic stenosis.
