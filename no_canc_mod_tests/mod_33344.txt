She has recently been complaining of increasing shortness of breath and therefore was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on heparin for a cardiac catheterization which was negative and a fat pad biopsy to rule out amyloid secondary to a speckled appearance of the myocardium on echo.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 1535**] for surgical evaluation of her mitral regurgitation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
LV EF is hyperdynamic, approximately 75%.
MV area by pressure half-time is 3.9 cm2 with a peak gradient of 14 mmHg and a mean gradient of 5 mmHg.
