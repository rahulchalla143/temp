Recently, she was diagnosed with a DVT in her right upper extremity; she has been on coumadin and lovenox bridge - however it seems according to the last pulmonary note coumadin is being held until tracheostomy tube is changed in early [**Month (only) 116**].

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-12-3**], the estimated PA systolic pressure is now lower (may not reflect a true change due to suboptimal technical quality of the current study acquired with the patient sitting up in a chair).
CT abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
It will also be VERY important to maintain her O2 sats between 88-92%, as the patient is a chronic CO2 retainer and O2 saturations that are too high can lead to hypercarbia.
The patient will have a repeat outpatient sleep study as well (see transitional issues).
Given her severe pulmonary hypertension, we repeated her echo with bubble study to look for shunt; no shunt was visualized.
Her sats remained in the low 90s.
An ultrasound of the upper back showed a hematoma.
She was noted to have GNRs in culture, likely colonization  # Cor pulmonale/right sided heart failure: Most recent ECHO shows EF >60% with right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis, consistent with her known R sided heart failure in the setting of OSA and pulmonary HTN.
Transitional Issues: - sleep follow up: The patient has a sleep study on [**2127-6-14**] with the sleep doctors; if there are cancellations, the sleep doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] contact the patient with a sooner appt for sleep study.
