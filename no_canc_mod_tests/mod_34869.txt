The patient's blood pressure dropped to 107/47, and her oxygenation was in the 80s.
Sensation: No response to noxious stimuli throughout.
On admission to MICU: PE: VS: temp 99.1 BP 128/57, HR 104, RR 25 intubated AC 16*350, 40% FiO2, O2 sat 99%.
Head CT([**7-14**])->Post-evac NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been interval right frontal craniotomy with evacuation of the previously seen right subdural hematoma.
Extensive periventricular hypoattenuation consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease is unchanged.
Head CT [**7-15**]: 1.
Head CT [**7-27**] 1.
X-rays Lt Wrist([**7-13**]) FINDINGS: There is soft tissue irregularity and gas seen along the dorsum of the hand.
CT sinus/max/[**Last Name (un) **]: 1.
CT abd: 1.
CXR [**7-30**] - There are low inspiratory volumes, lower than on [**2153-7-28**].
CXRs showed LLL opacification that improved over time, consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Labs: [**2153-7-13**] 09:26PM   PT-13.6* PTT-28.1 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2153-7-13**] 09:26PM   WBC-15.0* RBC-3.13* HGB-10.5* HCT-29.6* MCV-95 MCH-33.5* MCHC-35.4* RDW-13.6 [**2153-7-13**] 09:26PM   cTropnT-0.09* [**2153-7-13**] 09:26PM   GLUCOSE-105 UREA N-6 CREAT-0.4 SODIUM-129* POTASSIUM-2.8* CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-18* ANION GAP-12 [**2153-7-14**] 04:28AM   PHENYTOIN-11.5 [**2153-7-16**] transferrin 176 .
Labs on discharge: WBC 10.4, HB 8.6, Hct 22.9, Plt 496 Na 143, K 3.3, Cl 110, HCO 25, BUN 20, Cr 0.6, Gluc 126 AST 43, AST 48, AP 106, T bili 0.2 .
WBC peaked at 18 when pneumonia was diagnosed, has steadily gone down since treatment started.
Transaminitis peaked with AST 86, ALT 63.
A post-op CT showed typical post-operative changes with decreased mass effect.
Her neuro exam continued to improve and she was consistently following commands, although her left side remained plegic.
Hyponatremia: She was initially fluid restricted for a sodium nadir of 120, which gradual increased to 135 without the need of hypertonic saline or further fluid restriction.
On [**7-17**] she had an abd CT which showed a large hiatal hernia.
A nutrition consult recommended probalance TFs at a goal rate of 50cc/hr.
Her respiratory distress was also likely complicated by layering pleural effusions, followed by CXR and treated w/ intermittent Lasix diuresis.
Her BPs were stable to hypertensive and she did not require pressors.
her differential showed an elevated Eosinophil count, that trended down w/ d/c of Vanc/Zosyn.
Initial c/f ACCY given elevated LFTs, but no evidence of acute cholecystitis on RUQ U/S.
# Anemia: Pt had a hct drop on 7.21 down to 20.1, and PTT was elevated.
She had some tenderness on abdominal exam c/f a rectus sheath hematoma, but her Abd CT was neg for internal bleeding.
Her Hct and coags was checked frequently and stablized ~24-25 for the remainder of her ICU admission.
# Sinus Tachycardia: Likely hypovolemia (CVP low, Echo shows LVH, hyperdynamic systolic function w/ EF > 75%, TropT < 0.01) vs. respiratory distress vs pain (post-op) vs infection vs. agitation.
Pt was found to have a TSH of 6.7 and free T4 of 0.84, left untreated giving the likelihood of sick euthyroid syndrome.
Rpt Head Ct on 7.21 stable.
Rpt Head Ct on 7.25 showed diminishing SDH and decrease in mass effect.
Her LFTs trended down prior to her d/c from the ICU.
Her post-extubation ABGs were normal/slightly alkalotic, and her HCO3 levels returned to baseline.
They recommend repeat CT scan which showed stable resolution of the subdural bleeds.
Trended her transaminitis which were closer to normal.
