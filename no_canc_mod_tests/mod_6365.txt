He was placed on LTM EEG on [**3-22**] after transfer to the NeuroICU.
CT head without acute changes.
He currently is on depakote 1500mg [**Hospital1 **], Lamictal 200mg [**Hospital1 **], Carbamazepine 400mg/600mg.
#COAGULOPATHY / BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA: He was then noted to have a slow HCT decrease to a nadir of 25.5 on [**3-28**] from 44 over 10 days.
He had no obvious bleeding source and a CT torso on [**3-29**] revealed no hematoma.
His coags revealed PT: 150 PTT: 140.8 INR: 15.7 (highest reportable- stable on recheck).
He remained hemodynamically stable for the course of his MICU stay and his hct was trended and stable around 31 with no further noted bleeding.
Factor VII, X and II levels were added on to further evaluate this hypothesis and were pending discharge.
His INR was 1.2 at discharge and had been within the normal range since [**4-3**].
#ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: His creatinine increased on [**2178-3-29**] from baseline of 0.7 up to 1.6, which was tought to be due to vancomycin.
Would recommend checking creatinine within five days to ensure it is stable.
#HYPERTENSION: He was started on amlodipine for blood pressures ranging from 130- 150.
Would continue to monitor BP and consider d/c this medication if BP range 110s-130s.
TRANSITION ISSUES: -Acute kidney injury: Trend creatinine moving forward to ensure that continues to improve.
-Coagulopathy: Trend coags and follow up with hematology regarding pending factor studies -staple removal at surgical site  Medications on Admission: 1. carbamazepine 400mg / 600mg 2. divalproex DELAYED release 500mg [**Hospital1 **] 3. lamotrigine 200mg [**Hospital1 **] 4. simvastatin 20mg daily 5.
Your blood count declined and your blood was found to not be clotting correctly.
