On [**3-22**] overnight she spiked a temperature to 105.6.
A subclavian CVL was placed.
She was started on norepinephrine drip and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], vitals were: T 102.5, HR 108, BP 108/51, RR 18, SaO2 100% RA.
She was briefly taken off Levophed but systolic blood pressure dropped and levophed restarted.
A CT Torso was ordered and was unrevealing.
While in the ICU, labs drawn demonstrated a marked pancytopenia, abnormal diff (elevated monocytes, atypical cells) a transaminitis with elevated alkaline phosphatase, coagulopathy (high INR, PT and PTT), low AM cortisol (2.4) and modestly elevated lipase (73).
Cosyntropin stimulation test revealed appropriate response.

CXR was without evidence of consolidation.
Her abdominal exam was initially concerning although no evidence of free air was found on imaging and CT torso without evidence of acute infectious process.
ID was consulted and recommended checking CMV VL, HSV, EBV and HIV serologies which were sent.
Her monospot test was negative, and EBV serology was consistent with past EBV infection but no acute infection.
HIV and CMV testing were negative.
At the time of discharge, blood, urine, and mycolytic cultures were all negative.
Parvovirus and herpes virus studies were pending at the time of discharge.
The patient also had a cortisol-stim test, which was normal.
CT Torso did not reveal any other significant pathology.
# Pancytopenia: The patient initially demonstrated pancytopenia with WBC count of 1.0, Hct of 21.2 and ANC of 400-600.
Her WBC count slowly improved.
# Nutrition: The patient was malnourished with a low serum albumin of 2.7, as well as coaguloapathy (elevated PT/PTT/INR) that responded to Vitamin K administration.
