On admission a right femoral HD catheter was placed in case dialysis was needed, but her electrolytes and renal function remained normal and she continued to have good UOP throughout her stay.
She was continued on folate and pyridoxine for ethylene glycol metabolite elmination and [**7-23**] her ethylene glycol level was <10.
She was monitored on a valium CIWA scale ut did not require any doses.
You are now medically stable and your levels of ethylene glycol are undetectable.
