Head CT with no acute findings.
Final sensativities showed the organism was sensative to bactrim and not ciprofloxacin so the antibiotics were changed on [**3-30**] and a 7 day treatment course should be continued until [**2187-4-6**].
He was also noted to have a transaminase and bilirubin elevation on [**2187-3-29**] and underwent a RUQ U/S which showed cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
ALT/AST/Tbili trended down over next 2 days, although Alk Phos remained very mildly elevated.
Previously during the hospitalization he had failed a bedside and video speech and swallow study while delerious.
When his delerium cleared a repeat speech and swallow study evaluated him and he pased with some difficulty.
[ ] He will need f/u LFTs and CBC on [**2187-4-6**] to make sure his LFTs and CBC were not worsened by the addition of bactrim.
