Interval increase in size of large hematoma in the left thigh adductor muscle compartments since prior CT of [**2195-3-9**], with internal hematocrit effect.
Initially his INR was 3.1, so heparin drip was discontinued.
Repeat INR the morning of [**2195-3-6**] was 2.1, so patient was taken to cath lab for procedure.
On [**3-8**] he was also started on Vanc/Levofloxacin for concern for CAP and GPC in sputum & CXR concerning for left lung process.
His cough was not overly strong initially and he did require frequent suctioning but was able to protect his airway.
On [**3-20**] his sputum culture revealed ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES and his antibiotics were narrowed to cefepime.
** Pt was also found to have small lung nodules on CT scan of your chest.
Thus, on [**3-16**] he went to the OR were evaluation revealed no active extravasation but old, liquified hematoma.
A JP was placed and monitored for several days until ultimately pulled on [**3-21**].
Repeat CT / MRI imaging was unrevealing.
Thyroid studies checked and normal.
His TSH was mildy elevated but FT4 was normal, and LFTs were mildly elevated.
Pt should have PFTs as outpatient as a baseline, and be followed every 6 months.
TTE was neg [**3-23**] but not optimal for evaluation of valve but pt not stable enough for TEE.
The cultures were reviewed by Infectious disease who believed that the bactermia was contiminant and vancomycin was discontinued.
Pt did also have VRE in one bottle on [**4-1**] from PICc which was removed and pt remined afebrile, w nl wbc, continued clinical improvement, also future blood cultures remained negative, and again this was not treated.
