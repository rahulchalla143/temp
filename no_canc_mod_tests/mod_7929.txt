HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve prosthetic replacement, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presents with shortness of breath progressive over the past four days after undergoing a transesophageal echocardiogram several days prior to admission.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.5.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, Vancomycin, Ancef, Procainamide, which dropped his platelets.
Blood pressure 122/54.
Heart rate 60.
Respiratory rate 26.
Oxygen saturation 99% on 2 liters.
JVP 8 to 9 cm.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 7.4, hematocrit 33.1, platelets 100, sodium 142, potassium 5.0, which was hemolyzed, BUN 25, creatinine 1.5, glucose 183.
Chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion unchanged, possibly a small left pleural effusion.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with frequent premature atrial contractions, left axis deviation of the right bundle branch block and a left anterior vesicular block.
On [**2193-4-10**] the patient developed the acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath with oxygen saturations in the 70s.
Anemia and blood loss:  As noted the patient had a history of gastrointestinal bleed on anticoagulation in the past and had a slew of heme positive stools, melena and hematocrit drop, which required approximately one unit of packed red blood cells per day for several days to maintain his hematocrit above 28.
His stools became heme negative and his blood count stabilized at approximately 32.
At the time of discharge his hematocrit was stable at 32 and he had a guaiac negative stool.
Thrombocytopenia:  Stopping the Linezolid correlated with improvement in the patient's platelet count up to 69 on the day of discharge.
Status post MRSA pneumonia:  The patient remained afebrile with a normal white blood cell count at this time.
Congestive heart failure with an EF of 35% on his echocardiogram on [**2193-4-10**]:  The patient was diuresed with Lasix 40 mg intravenously b.i.d.
Diuresis was slowed just because his bicarbonate had creeped up to 38 though his BUN and creatinine had remained relatively stable at 34 and 1.1.
Chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient's creatinine has actually improved over his baseline in the mid 1s with a creatinine of 1.1 on discharge.
Ideally he wold be on [**Month/Day/Year **], but again this is being held given his recent gastrointestinal bleeding and hematocrit drops.
You should have your hematocrit and platelets checked in three days.
If your hematocrit remained stable for a week you could consider adding back aspirin to your regimen.
