The cultures grew out methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus.
On repeat ultrasound, was found to have  7- cm x 2-cm fluid collection at the site, not appearing loculated or rim-enhancing.
Family History: Mom with an intra-abdominal cancer, unknown type.
-although F waves were impersistent in the ulnar nerve and absent in the peroneal and tibial nerves, as may be seen in early [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome (<1 week), normal recruitment argues against GBS -no evidence for a presynaptic or postsynaptic disorder of neuromuscular junction transmission (as in Botulism and myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] respectively) -no evidence for a generalized myopathy  Radiologic Data:  MRI Brain w/Contrast: Few scattered non-specific foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensities.
Otherwise, no significant abnormalities on MRI without Gadolinium.
MRI C-Spine w/o Contrast: mild degenerative changes of C-spine in the form of mild discrete disc bulging (C5-C6, C6-C7), no significant spinal stenosis or evidence of cord compression  CT Chest:  Foci of subcutaneous air and fluid collection measuring up to 7.5 cm within the right mastectomy site, likely post-surgical.

Neurolgy was consulted and she underwent various neurological studies none of which showed any clear cut diagnosis.
Vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulse oximetry was monitored closely and the patient maintained adequate oxygenations.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely.
