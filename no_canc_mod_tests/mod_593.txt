EKG showed a sinus tachycardia, rate 112, P-R of 150,    normal axis, T-wave inversions in III and F, unchanged    when compared with EKG dated [**2104-5-29**].
Around 8 p.m., patient's condition had deteriorated enough that he was extremely delirious and his respiratory rate had increased to approximately 40, and he was taking short and shallow breaths.
After intubation, an arterial blood gas was performed, which showed a pH of 7.14, pCO2 of 36, and a lactate of 8.0.
Followup chest x-ray after central line placement showed a moderate sized pneumothorax on the left, which was decompressed with a chest tube placed by Cardiothoracic Surgery.
Around midnight that evening, approximately six hours after admission to the Intensive Care Unit, patient's blood pressure had progressively fallen and now required intravenous pressors.
Serial blood gases showed progressive worsening of his acidosis, and by 10 a.m. the next morning, 16 hours after admission, his blood gas showed a pH of 6.92 and a lactate of 11.8.
His potassium continued to rise throughout a few short hours in the Intensive Care Unit, and reached a level of 9.1 the following morning at 11 a.m.
Blood pressures despite maximum dose of three vasopressive medications remained with the systolics in the 80s to 90s and heart rate in the 50s to 60s.
Blood cultures drawn from time of admission in the Emergency Department later grew out methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus in four blood culture bottles.
Further investigation and discussion with wife revealed that patient had a dental procedure approximately three weeks prior to admission.
After discussion with his wife, an autopsy was performed (which report is not available at this time), which was consistent with septic emboli to multiple organs including his kidneys.
