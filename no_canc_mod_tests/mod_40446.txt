Admission Date:  [**2159-11-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-6-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5868**] Chief Complaint: Acute Stroke, s/p IV t-PA   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IV TPA  History of Present Illness: 74 year old man with hx of CAD (s/p MI, s/p CABG), HTN, Right carotid stenosis (s/p carotid stent [**10-5**]), and arthritis who presented to the ED on [**11-25**] complaining of left sided weakness.
CT/CTA was done and was negative for early signs of infarction, but did show a paucity of vessels in the right MCA territory.
NIHSS=8 (see exam below).
Registers [**2-1**], recalls [**2-1**] in 5 minutes.
Gait/Romberg: Unable to assess  Pertinent Results: 7.1>37.8<197  73N 17L 5E Na 143  K 4.0  Cl 106  CO2 25  BUN 20  Cr 1.1  Glu 112 Ca 9.4  Mg 1.7  Ph 3.6 Lip 43 PT 12.8  PTT 23.3  INR 1.1 A1C 5.2 Chol 155  TG 110  HDL 69  LDL 64 U/A neg  Head CT [**11-25**] - Abrupt cut-off of the anterior division of the right middle cerebral artery (M3), consistent with acute occlusive thrombus or embolus.
Head CT [**11-26**] and [**12-3**] - Stable head CT with evidence of evolving right middle cerebral artery territory infarct, without definite hemorrhage.
MRI head [**11-25**] - Large area of restricted diffusion in the right middle cerebral artery territory in the right frontal and temporal lobes, consistent with acute infarct.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 4058**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4579**]s significantly decreased flow in the right mid cerebral artery branches  Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**11-26**] - Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Initial exam notable for left sided inattention, dysarthria, left facial, left sided weakness (primarily in arm with cortical hand), left sided sensory deficit to all modalities, left sided cortical sensory loss.
Serial head CTs stable, but more dense weakness beginning on HD#2.
Exam remains most notable for dysarthria, L hemiplegia and L extinction to double simultaneous stimulation.
Blood pressure was initially allowed to autoregulate.
Heme - Should start Coumadin 2.5mg QHS on [**12-5**], goal INR ~2 (low therapeutic goal as Pt will also be on Aspirin and Plavix and would be at high risk for bleeding with higher INR).
Check INR twice weekly.
Tox - For significant alcohol history, Pt was started on Thiamine, Folate.
Medications on Admission: Plavix ASA 325 Lipitor NTG Fluticasone Atneolol Lisinopril Folate Elavil Pletal Folate Temazepam   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right MCA stroke   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please do not load with coumadin, just start coumadin gently and allow inr to trend slowing to goal INR of 2.
