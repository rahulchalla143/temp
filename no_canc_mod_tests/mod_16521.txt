Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 84M with h/o CVA, afib, h/o PE, recurrent aspiration PNA, recent admission for abdominal distension presenting from [**Hospital 7137**] with an O2 sat of 65%, HTN to 192/130, HR 150s.
Labs showed WBC 16, subtherapeutic INR of 1.4 -> given enoxaparin.
UA dirty, initial CXR not too impressive with mild pulmonary edema and a possible left lower lobe process.
EKG with Afib and RVR.
With the decline in hsis O2 sat, the patient was put on BiPap and subsequently vomited and dropped his sats further.
For his vomiting the patient was given one dose of zofran and a repeat chest x-ray was performed that showed substantial incease in bilateral opacties and mild pulmonary edema.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation with RVR at a rate in the 150s with similar morphology to his baseline.
His vitals prior to transfer were: 113/70 130 fib 30s, 98% NRB.

CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-16**], there may be slight decrease in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications, predominantly involving the mid and lower lung zones.
Again, the possibilities of extensive aspiration versus some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure must be considered.
AXR: Again seen is marked diffuse colonic dilatation, similar in appearance as compared to prior CT from [**2190-9-6**].
Brief Hospital Course: 84M with h/o CVA, afib, h/o PE, recurrent aspiration PNA, recent admission for abdominal distension presenting from [**Hospital 7137**] with an O2 sat of 65%.
Unfortunately, there was no urine culture sent prior to receiving abx.
The Initial CXR showed some evidence of left lower lobe process.
BNP was >[**2181**].
