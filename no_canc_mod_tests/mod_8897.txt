Imaging: CXR [**2193-7-23**]: Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam from [**2193-3-11**].
TTE [**2193-7-24**]: The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2193-7-25**]: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertension.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: # NSTEMI: Patient came in with NSTEMI with no obvious changes on her EKG, but had chest pain x 6 weeks and her troponin increased from 0.02-->0.11 in the ED.
On [**7-24**] she had a TTE which showed normal biventricular systolic function.
She went to the cath lab and underwent a left heart cath which showed 90% occlusion of the proximal LAD, RCA total occlusion and OM disease.
A repeat TTE showed normal biventricular systolic function as well.
