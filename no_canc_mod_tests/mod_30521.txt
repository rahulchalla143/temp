According to our records, the patient has a history of stable angina- chest pressure and dyspnea occurring with exertion, never rest, for which she underwent a stress MIBI in 09, which was negative for symptoms or ischemic EKG changes, but nuclear study revealed mild reversible inferior wall  defect.
Vitals on presentation to ED were pain 0, 99.4, 92, 159/86, 20, 99% on ?
EKG revealed Q waves in II, III and ST segment elevations in II, III, avF, V5, V6.
Troponin was elevated at 5 (CK and CKMB flat).
CXR had a small L-sided pleural effusion, but no evidence of PNA.
Became dyspneic and hypertensive- repeat EKG showed improvement in V5/V6 STE, but new TWI in V2/3.
Repeat CXR unchanged and without evidence of volume overload.
Vitals prior to transfer 83, 134/82, 24, 98% 4LNC.
STUDIES: CXR [**2157-2-27**]: IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema.
Atelectasis and retrocardiac distribution is stable compared with prior with a possible small left pleural effusion.
TTE [**2157-2-28**]: Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.

URINE CX [**2157-2-27**]: [**2157-2-27**] 11:45 am URINE     Site: CATHETER     URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
Exercise MIBI in [**7-16**] was without symptoms or ischemic changes on EKG (performed 6 mins on mod [**Doctor Last Name 4001**]), but nuclear portion revealed a mild reversible inferior wall defect.
EKG on presentation revealed Q waves & ST segment elevations in Inferior/Lateral leads.
Given her age and documented history of medication non-compliance, it was decided not to pursue cardiac catheterization.
She was started on a nitro gtt for dyspnea and hypertension, which was weaned once her enzymes peaked.
Given her kidney function we did not begin an ace inhibitor.
# ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY: The patient had no echocardiogram prior to this admission.
Post-infarct TTE demonstrated EF 30-35%, moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with inferior ischemia/infarction in addition to dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, suggestive of RV ischemia/infarction.
# RHYTHM: Monitored on telemetry and remained in sinus rhythm.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine of 1.7 on admission.
Creatinine 1.5 on presentation to ED two weeks prior for viral gastroenteritis.
Delerium labs (TSH, B12/folate, LFTs) were within normal limits.
