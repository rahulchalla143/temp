IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2157-1-12**] through [**2158-10-30**].
Now with dropping HCT and increased heart rate suggestive of hemodynamic instability.
After transfusion, her HCT stabilized and she showed no further signs of bleeding/melena.
Her pantoprazole was eventually changed to a PO formulation and she was advanced to purree diet with nectar thick liquids with no complications.
# Myocardial ischemia - The patient presented with significant ST depressions in V2-V6 during her acute bleed which resolved after fluid and blood administration.
Her cardiac enzymes did increase to a peak troponin of >0.5, likely demand ischemia.
She was tachycardic and hypertensive after blood administration which was initially controlled with an esmolol drip but was eventually transitioned to PO lopressor.
