Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2158-3-15**], the LVEF may have improved.
If indicated, a cardiac MRI may better assess LVEF.
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 8.6 cm.
L4-L5: A diffuse disc bulge is present which along with facet arthrosis and ligamentum flavum infolding result in moderate to severe spinal canal narrowing and moderate crowding of the nerve roots.
L5-S1: A broad-based central disc protrusion is present without significant spinal canal narrowing.
If clinically indicated, post-contrast imaging can be repeated with patient co-operation.

Transition Issues: - CBC and Chem 7 need to be monitored closely - Anti-hypertensives and diuretics were held at discharge and need to be restarted carefully pending improvement of blood pressure and creatinine .
She had an echo which demonstrated a preserved EF.
2) Sepsis [**1-24**] UTI: The patient had profound WBC count on her UA and has a positve Urine culture with gram negative rods.
When her cultures returned with the aforementioned speciation, her antibiotics were narrowed to PO cipro.
4) [**Last Name (un) **]: The patient has an eosinophilia, and rare eos on her microscopic exam.
She also had repeated urine lytes which were not suggestive of a pre-renal etiology.
6) Mild Elevation in Gap in the setting of ARF with CR 1.7, baseline 1.0.
9) Hyponatremia: The patient had a low serum NA with a urine osm and serum osm to suggest that she had SIADH, that was secondary to a chronic left sided effusion.
Her MRI shows dejenerative changes of the L/T spine, and crowding of the cauda equiana.
She did not have evidence of a retroperitoneal bleed or fluid, but her MRI study was limited since she was not given contrast.
Her strength was intact symmetrically, and her sensation and reflexes were intact.
