He initially required a NRB with improvement in his oxygen saturation so that he was able to be weaned to 5LNC with sats in the high 90's.
A CXR was done that showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with a small RLL consolidation that was read as atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
EKG was v-paced that was reportedly unchanged from prior.
Labs were notable for a white count of 11.2 with 88.6% neutrophils, a BNP of [**Numeric Identifier **], which was up from 5487 on [**2128-4-22**], a Cr of 2.2 (near baseline) and a lactate of 3.0.
VS on transfer were: 98.8, 79, 101/63, 26, 100% on 5LNC.
Systolic and diastolic heart failure with LVEF of 45-50%.
NECK: Supple with JVP at earlobe.

Blood cultures 5/16 pending Sputum: Gram stain and culture - contaminated, multiple mixed flora .
Rapid viral swab - not enough epithelial cells .
CXR on admission: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.
ECHO The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) due primarily to right ventricular predominance and interventricular dependence resulting in dyssynergic interventricular septal displacement, rather than actual contractile dysfunction of the left ventricular myocardium.
Labs at discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: 68 y/o M with a complicated cardiac past medical history who presents with dyspnea, rigors and chills after a week of cold symptoms, found to have a possible RLL PNA on CXR.
#) Hypoxia: CXR with possible RLL infiltrate, patient has clinical symptoms of pneumonia including cough and fever so was presumptively treated for CAP with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for 5 day course (completed in hospital and patient did not have fevers for 4 days prior to discharge) However, CXR findings and elevated BNP also concerning for pulmonary vascular congestion, which could have been exacerbated by the 2L of IVF given in the ER and dietary indiscretions recently.
Sputum cultures were contaminated as were repeat DFAs and patient diuresed well with 80mg IV lasix twice daily on the day of admission.
His weights showed a decrease from admission weight of 237 --> 235 on discharge (likely error due to different scales as patient was diuresed net 5L on this admission).
Appeared hypervolemic on exam with significant ascites and some lower extremity edema.
BNP elevated above any prior measurements in our system and CXR with mild pulmonary congestion are both consistent with heart failure.
Coumadin was restarted in house and INR was 1.6 on discharged but his coumadin was held on discharge until Right heart cath on monday afternoon.
Creatinine also improved during hospitalization with diuresis, suggestive of passive congestion component to his impaired renal function.
His creatinine was 1.9 on discharge.
