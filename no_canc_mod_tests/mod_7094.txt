IMAGING: [**12-6**] Renal U/S showed heterogeneous echogenecity in the upper pole of L kidney which could correspond to hydronephrosis.
[**12-6**] Abd CT showed: 1) Striated nephrogram on the left, with perinephric stranding, findings consistent with pyelonephritis.
2) Trace free fluid within abdomen and pelvis  [**12-8**] CXR showed interval development of left lower lobe consolidation which could represent pneumonia  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
Pyelonephritis/UTI The patient arrived in the ED on [**12-5**] with the following VS: T102.1, P119, BP 113/60, RR 20, Sat 100%.
Three hours later her BP dropped to 91/34, then 75/54.
A renal U/S and an abdominal CT were consistent with pyelonephritis.
The pt was transferred to the MICU and her BP stabilized without pressors.
A urine culture grew E. coli which was resistant to Bactrim and Ampicillin, and sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin, and Nitrofurantoin (with intermediate sensitivity to Unasyn).
Her R IJ catheter was removed and a CXR showed a new left lower lobe consolidation which "could represent pneumonia."
Her PO intake was poor secondary to her nausea, which was treated with Compazine and Anzemet.
