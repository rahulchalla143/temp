The patient says that his blood sugars have been running between 150 and 200.
An echocardiogram in [**2181-11-13**] showed an ejection fraction of greater than 70%, with no focal wall motion abnormalities.
Hypertension, labile with systolic blood pressures running between 100 and 240.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.3, blood pressure 191/103, heart rate 104, respiratory rate 15, saturating 99% on room air.
Otherwise, the head and neck examination was unremarkable.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.

This achieved somewhat adequate blood pressure control with systolic blood pressures running in the 180s.
A urine culture was negative.
Echocardiogram in [**2181-11-13**] showing an ejection fraction of greater than 70%.
He was scheduled for a follow-up gastric emptying study on [**2182-1-8**] at 8:30 in the morning.
