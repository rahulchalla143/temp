Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Soon after birth the patient was diagnosed with profound hypoglycemia requiring aggressive intervention with dextrose infusion up to D20.

She was started on diazoxide with stabilization of her blood glucoses and was able to be transitioned off concentrated IV dextrose-containing fluid to normal enteral feedings.
The patient had an MRI of the brain as part of the evaluation for the hypoglycemia and that MRI was normal.

A brain MRI was within normal limits.
