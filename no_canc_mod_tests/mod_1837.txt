Head CT showed a linear hyperintense region in the left central temporal lobe but also other lesions in the left posterior parietal hyperintensity spanning 10 images and slight surrounding hypointensity and a left frontal cortical hypointensity with a small surrounding region of hyperintensity.
His blood pressure was 188/69 and was treated with labetalol 40 intravenously.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure was 97/44 on admission.
Heart rate of 57.
Respirations 13, saturating at 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His cardiovascular exam showed a regular rate and rhythm, distant with a soft S1, S2, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur to the left upper sternal borders.
Began to follow a three step command, but touched his tongue instead of his nose on finger to nose and performed heel to shin in the air without touching his shin.
His [**Location (un) 1131**] was intact, he had difficulty describing the meaning of words, barn, swallow, he laughed as though the barn swallowed and then could not explain the meaning of the sentence.
Funduscopic exam revealed normal vasculature with sharp optic discs.
Reflex testing revealed symmetric reflexes throughout with an upgoing toe on Babinski testing on the right.
Sensory examination, pinprick, temperature, crude touch were intact.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION AT THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  Glucose of 128, BUN 21, creatinine 1.5, white blood cell count 17 with a differential of 78% neutrophils, 15% lymphocytes.
An MRI showed left MCA/ACA and left MCA/PCA watershed strokes with acute and subacute hemorrhagic conversions.
His Intensive Care Unit course was notable for labile blood pressure requiring labetalol, other times requiring Neo-Synephrine to achieve a blood pressure in the range of 120-150.
His blood pressures from the arm were unreliable requiring a thigh cuff and arterial line.
His blood pressure settled in this range without pressors or labetalol by [**3-18**].
Given that his blood pressures were under better control, he was transferred to the Neurology [**Hospital1 **] Service, however, he developed intermittent episodes of atrial flutter which might have been old or related to underlying coronary artery disease.
He was placed on a low dose of Lopressor and maintained a blood pressure range of 120-140.
