Both catheterization and echocardiogram in [**2118**] showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral regurgitation.
The patient was referred today from the clinic to the CCU for an elective Swan-Ganz to help assess her intracardiac pressures and adjust her medications accordingly to see if we can prevent her recurrent admissions for congestive heart failure.
The patient on admission was also noted to have a hematocrit of 19, but she denied melena and hematemesis.
Last echocardiogram was [**2119-9-21**], which showed an ejection fraction of 60-65%, left atrial enlargement, right atrial enlargement, trace aortic insufficiency, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, with severe pulmonary hypertension.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.9?????
?, pulse 51, blood pressure 84/25, respirations 10, oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 6.4, hematocrit 19.8, platelet count 221,000; INR 4.0, PT 24.6, PTT 45.0; sodium 128, potassium 4.8, bicarb 88, chloride 26, BUN 149, creatinine 2.7, glucose 154.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  She was a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure, with multiple admissions, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and Amiodarone, diabetes type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and hyperthyroidism, presenting with worsening congestive heart failure symptoms and anemia, as well as elevated BUN and creatinine ratio, and anemia with a hematocrit of 19.8.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had an exam consistent with congestive heart failure.
Hematocrit:  The patient has had over a ten-point hematocrit drop with negative guaiac positive stool.
GI:  We will reverse her INR with Vitamin K and start Protonix at 40 mg IV q.d.
Echocardiogram was done which showed an ejection fraction of 55%.
Her pulse was in the 50s and 60s throughout but stable.
Pulmonary:  The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram but has a history of PE.
At the time of discharge, the patient had good oxygen saturations on room air.
Creatinine returned to baseline of 1.1.
The patient later had a barium study with small bowel follow through which was a unremarkable small bowel study; barium passed freely through the small bowel reaching the cecum within 45 min.
Hematocrit eventually stabilized around 31 with no evidence of further bleeding.
