Admission Date:  [**2132-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-2-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-11-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5606**] Chief Complaint: anemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD Flex Sig Capsule study   History of Present Illness: 57 yo F with chronic anemia of unkown etiology, RA and MGUS, referred to the ED for a Hct of 16.
A capsule study was unsuccsesful when the capsule did not pass through her stomach.
CXR with Right base opacity, given levofloxacin.
Vitals prior to transfer: HR 100, BP 101/55, RR 16, 99%2L, 98.1 T.  On arrival to the ICU, patient is getting 3rd Unit of PRBCs and a liter of normal saline.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 F with RA, chronic anemia (baseline Hct 27-30) presented to the ED with a Hct of 17 found on routine labs.
She was initially admitted to the ICU where she underwent a GI workup.
Patient had had a thorough GI workup including endoscopy and colonoscopy [**12-7**] for evaluation of anemia.
Capsule study performed but capsule did not pass the stomach (not visualized on surveliance x-ray here).
GI was consulted and patient underwent bowel prep and upper and lower endoscopy which demonstrated gastritis but no significant bleeding source.
Additional concerns of poor production given high WBC count and may suggest heme malignancy (reticulocyte count of 7.9, RI of 1.3).
On admission, patient was transfused 3 units PRBCs with appropriate response of Hct from 17.7 to 28.1.
The ICU team documented that there was no concern for active ischemia as EKG ST depression resolved with 3 units of blood however, her cardiologist called it an NSTEMI.
An echo done [**2132-2-27**] demonstrated an EF of 25-30% with regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Outside lipids from [**2-7**] demonstrated an LDL of 132 and HDL 63.
Given that her BP was 100s, lisinopril was not started prior to discharge but the patient was advised to follow up with her cardiologist as scheduled on [**3-12**] and discuss restarting it.
She will also discuss getting a stress test as her ECHO showed a LV systolic dysfunction concerning for an ischemic etiology.
# Infiltrate on CXR with increased WBC.
# Question Sleep apnea:  Patient was noted to be snoring with desaturations to the mid 80s while on continuous O2 monitoring.
She would recover her saturations promptly without any intervention but likely needs to follow up with an outpatient sleep study with consideration of CPAP.
