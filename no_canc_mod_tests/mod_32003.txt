**FINAL REPORT [**2198-3-29**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2198-3-29**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2198-4-1**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2198-4-4**]):    NO GROWTH.
**FINAL REPORT [**2198-3-30**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2198-3-30**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2198-3-28**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac opacity may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
[**2198-3-28**] CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube that has its tip at the top of the clavicles, approximately 7 cm above the carina.
[**2198-3-28**] Abdominal ultrasound - IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited study due to respiratory motion.
[**2198-3-28**] CXR - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
[**2198-3-29**] Cardiac Cath - COMMENTS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right-sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 16 mmHg, mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 35/19 mmHg, and elevated left ventricular filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 20 mmHg.
Assuming an oxygen consumption of 125 ml/min/m2, and assuming a pulmonary venous saturation of 98%, the calculated Qp was 8.0 L/min and Qs was 10.6 L/min.
However, inability to directly measure a PV saturation and the clinical suspicion for intrapulmonary shunting challenges these calculations.
[**2198-3-29**] CT head w/o contrast - CONCLUSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
[**2198-3-29**] CTA chest - IMPRESSION: 1.
If clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism is high, a V/Q scan should be obtained.
Coronary artery, aortic annulus, and aortic valve calcifications, of unknown hemodynamic significance.
[**2198-3-30**] Shunt study - IMPRESSION: Study is consistent with the presence of a right-to-left shunt.
[**2198-3-30**] CT abdomen/pelvis w/o contrast - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2198-3-31**] CXR - FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube terminates 6.4 cm above carina and could be advanced slightly for standard positioning.
[**2198-3-31**] CXR - Widespread pulmonary opacification developed in both lungs in addition to the previous consolidation in the left lower.
[**2198-4-1**] CXR - Generalized pulmonary opacification probably combination of edema and pneumonia, particularly in the left lower lobe has worsened since [**3-31**].
[**2198-4-1**] CXR - Sequence of pulmonary abnormalities on chest radiographs since [**3-28**], suggests the development of pneumonia, particularly in left lower lobe, followed by evidence of volume overload and most recently worsening generalized pulmonary opacification which could be due to a combination of edema and hemorrhage, showing particular worsening over the past five hours.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 80664**] is a 65 year old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD admitted to an OSH with SOB who was transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia.
The patient also had a LLL infiltrate on his admission CXR and was treated with vancomycin and zosyn for HAP following arrival for the duration of his MICU course.
CTA showed no central large PE, but was a limited study.
There was concern raised at the OSH for intrinsic lung disease and history of IPF, however, the patient's CXR did not show evidence of significant IPF.
Following intubation, O2 sats >90% were achieved by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.
MAPs improved with platelets and FFP infusion, suggesting that shunting was playing a significant role.
Oxygen saturations improved briefly, however, they could not be maintained, even with blood pressure support.
On the day prior to the patient's death his oxygen sats dropped to the mid 80s on an FiO2 of 100%.
CPR was not begun as it was felt to be medically futile given the severity of the patient's illness.
The patient was HIT antibody negative both at this hospital and at the outside hospital.
Peripheral smear was unremarkable and DIC labs were negative.
His hematocrit was 42 on initial presentation to the OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].
DIC labs were negative and peripheral smear was not suggestive.
He had a head CT that was negative for any acute process.
His creatinine peaked at 1.4 shortly after admission and then trended back downward.
