IMAGING:  CT Abd/pelvis [**4-21**] 1.
Renal ultrasound [**4-21**]: Limited study.
CXR [**4-26**] Frontal view of the chest demonstrates tracheostomy in midline.
CXR [**5-30**] As compared to the prior study, tracheostomy is in place, right PICC line tip is at the level of mid low SVC.
Liver/gallbladder ultrasound [**6-16**] The gallbladder wall is mildly thickened however this is likely related to it being partially collapsed.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**6-17**] 1.
Findings have progressed when compared to the chest images from the abdominal CT of [**2189-4-21**].
CXR [**6-23**] Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has increased, obscuring much of the left lung where there could be either asymmetric edema or pneumonia, both worsened since the previous examination.
# Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: Patient p/w leukocytosis, CXR demonstrating bilateral pneumonia, cultures growing pseudomonas.
# Acute Renal Failure/Electrolyte disturbance: Patient was admitted with Creatinine of 5.5 ([**Month/Day (2) 5348**] of 1.8) and a significant acidemia (pH 7.04), thought to be [**2-11**] [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting of sepsis complicated by ATN.
His Cr rose to 8.4.
He was started on phosphate binders and his potassium began to rise slowly.
Blood, urine and sputum cultures were unrevealing, except for gram negative rods in the sputum.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**2189-6-16**] showed a normal appearing liver and gallbladder.
CT abd/pelvis did not show any infectious source.
His HCT trended down gradually over time probably from frequent phlebotomy and decreased production given worsened renal failure.
Urine cx and UA rechecked on [**5-24**] for concern for appearance of urine and mild leukocytosis, he was started on meropenem on [**5-25**] considering a urine cx concerning for ESBL earlier during admission.
Final bacterial urine cx showed no growth so meropenem was discontinued.
Fungal cx grew out [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10577**] so pt was continued on fluconazole for 14 day course.

Your kidneys have started producing urine again, however, your creatinine is still elevated but has improved during this admission.
We also made some changes in your blood pressure medications, which should also help control your heart rate.
During your admission, your blood pressure and heart rate were well controlled on prazosin and diltiazem, and these should be continued as directed below.
Medications: - START taking Prazosin 1 mg twice a day - START taking Diltiazem 45 mg four times a day - START taking Famotidine 20 mg daily - START taking Darbopoietin 40 mcg injected once a week - START taking hydrocortisone 2.5% rectal cream 1 application twice a day to hemorrhoids - START taking lactulose 30 mL up to every 8 hours as needed for constipation - START taking probiotic three times a day - START taking senna up to twice a day as needed for constipation - START taking bisacodyl up to every night as needed for constipation - START taking potassium chloride 10 mEq daily  - CONTINUE taking levothyroxine 25 mcg daily - CONTINUE taking glipizide 5 mg daily - CONTINUE using artificial tears as needed for eye dryness - CONTINUE using albuterol-ipratroprium inhalers every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing - CONTINUE insulin as needed according to sliding scale  Followup Instructions: Please arrange follow-up with your outpatient physician.
