Blood pressure was 222/75, initial pulse oximetry 85 percent in room air.
The CT/CT angiogram was normal without evidence of bleed or early infarct.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, her blood pressure was 222/75, pulse 90, respirations 20, oxygen saturation 96 percent on six liters.
General exam revealed lungs with rhonchi bilaterally, heart regular rate and rhythm, abdomen soft and nontender.
Neurological exam revealed she was awake, alert with her eyes open and no verbal output, not following any commands.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, complete blood count was unremarkable.
CK and troponin were negative.
BUN and creatinine was 29/1.6.
Glucose 189.
Chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure.
Her blood pressure ranged 150s.
Her blood pressure was controlled with Hydralazine and Lopressor.
She was noted at one point to have some abdominal distension with possible tenderness on exam and had further two episodes of bilious vomiting.
Electroencephalogram was done on [**2130-10-31**] which showed slow background without epileptiform activity consistent with encephalopathy.
The electroencephalogram did show some focal slowing in the right anterior quadrant and the loss of cortical rhythms broadly on the left, both suggesting additional focal abnormalities beyond the encephalopathy.
Repeat head CT was done on [**2130-11-2**] to evaluate for any sign of infarct.
The head CT showed a possible sign of left middle cerebral artery region infarct with subtle sulcal loss of definition.
Surface echocardiogram was done for embolic workup for the possible stroke.
Echocardiogram showed mildly dilated left atrium, borderline to mildly hypertrophied left ventricle, overall preserved left ventricular systolic function.
Right ventricular function could not be adequately assessed.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] blood pressure medications are currently being held with blood pressure running 150s-160s.
