Her urine was -ve for UTI but CT abdomen demonstrated multiple wedge-shaped/rounded areas of hypo-attenuation within a  mildly enlarged left kidney consistent with pyelonephritis/lobar nephronia.
Patient also underwent LP which was negative for meningitis.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling  pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
CT CHEST: 1) Bilateral lower lobe predominant dependent areas of consolidation accompanied by ground glass attenuation and small centrilobular opacities.
CT ABD: IMPRESSION: Multiple rounded or slightly wedge-shaped areas of mixed hypoattenuation within a slightly enlarged left kidney, in this context, strongly suggestive of acute focal bacteria nephritis (old term "acute lobar nephronia").
Due to her hypoxia a chest x-ray was obtained which was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
Echocardiogram done the following morning showed normal cardiac function.
A repeat chest x-ray showed pulmonary effusions, so a non-contrast high-res CT was obtained to evaluate the lungs, which demonstrated a superimposed bilateral severe aspiration pneumonia.
