The patient was found to have an elevated blood pressure of 200/100 and inconclusive chest x-ray with a questionable widened mediastinum.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation and for possible aortic dissection.
A CAT confirmed the presence of a thoracic aortic dissection.
An MRA was also performed, which showed the aortic dissection starting just distal to the left subclavian and extending down to the bilateral iliacs.
Blood pressure 160s/80s.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities pulses 2+, dorsalis pedis pulse, posterior tibial pulse, radial, femoral and carotids.
INITIAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count of 18.7, hematocrit 46.5, platelets 291, 78% neutrophils, 3 bands, 10 lymphocytes.
Chem 7 was sodium 142, potassium 2.6, chloride 104, bicarb 21, BUN 14, creatinine .8, glucose 189, anion gap of 17.
Magnesium was 1.8, INR 1.0, AST 65, ALT 77, alkaline phosphatase 99, T bilirubin .3, amylase 66, CK 170, MB 3.
Urinalysis was clear.
Arterial blood gas performed was pH 7.21, carbon dioxide of 47 and oxygen of 224.
Lactate level was 8.4.
CTA showed thoracic aortic dissection from take off of left subclavian to the both common iliac arteries, avulsed origin of the ciliac SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
MRI was consistent with CTA.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 50 year-old male found to have a thoracic aortic dissection with wide involvement and hypertension with systolic blood pressure in the 200s.
The patient was taken for a mesenteric angiogram, which showed good filling of the blood vessels.
Lactate levels were followed as well as chemistries quite closely initially q two hours and then q four hours and then b.i.d., which revealed a gradual decrease of the lactate to normal levels.
Due to his abnormal blood gas the patient was hyperventilated to rectify his blood pH.
The patient had a esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed by the gastrointestinal team while he was intubated, which showed multiple stress ulcers in the stomach as well as the duodenum, which was consistent with his heme positive stools and gradually falling hematocrit.
Hematocrits were followed.
The patient did require a blood transfusion after which hematocrits did stop rising day by day until normal levels.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was initially kept NPO in the beginning of his hospital course.
Magnesium and other electrolytes were replaced prn.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to follow up with Vascular Surgery in one month to have a repeat CTA prior to a vascular surgery appointment at which point he will be evaluated for stent placement or further medical management.
