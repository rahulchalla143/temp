Bedside evaluation by the resident and attending was performed and it was deemed that he was A&Ox3 and understood the risks and benefits of leaving the hospital, including imminent death.
He initially had a pulse and was breathing spontaneously and so he was transported to the ED.
CXR revealed a right pneumothorax and a tube thoracostomy was performed.
Labs notable for lactate 8.3, K 6.0, ABG 7.29/36/129.

Prolonged Q-T interval compared to the previous tracing of [**2104-3-30**].
This examination was read in conjunction with the followup study performed 20 minutes after this, and in the followup study, there is a chest tube in the left chest with almost complete re-expansion of the left lung.
[**2104-12-6**] Head CT without contrast - IMPRESSION: 1.
Final internal length is 43 cm, with the tip positioned in the SVC.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2104-12-25**] CT Chest without contrast - IMPRESSION: 1.
Cuff of the ETT might be slightly hyperinflated.
[**2104-12-27**] EEG - IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a drowsy or mildly encephalopathic background with no areas of prominent focal slowing and no clear epileptiform features.
[**2104-12-28**] EEG - IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed some left hemisphere slowing but no clear epileptiform features.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-12-22**], the right ventricular cavity is slightly larger.
Urine tox was negative in ED.
Serum tox initially with elevated  EtOH but then decreased to mid-20s prior to leaving AMA.
# Sepsis from endovascular Coagulase negative staphylococcus infection: The patient had Coagulase negative Staph aureus in cultures from [**12-15**], [**12-17**], [**12-20**] (1 of 2 bottles ??????
Transthoracic echocardiograms on [**12-22**] and [**12-29**] were negative for vegetation.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] and spine plain films to assess for possible osteomyelitis/abscess were negative.
# Altered Mental Status / Bipolar disorder: Combination of anoxic insult from cardiac arrest, underlying schizoaffective and bipolar disoder, history of alcohol abuse and possible Wernicke's, and sepsis.
He had 3 EEG studies during his ICU stay, none of which showed any evidence of seizure activity.
During this admission, regimen required several adjustments, and once agitation improved, his anti-hypertensives were able to be discontinued, since his blood pressure also improved.
EEG studies and c-spine imaging were performed but were negative for seizures or C-spine cord compression respectively.
His upper extremity deficits improved as mental status also improved as above.
Iron studies, B12, and folate levels were checked and showed normal ferritin (63) but decreased Iron/TIBC ratio.
He will need outpatient colonoscopy for workup of guaiac positive stools.
