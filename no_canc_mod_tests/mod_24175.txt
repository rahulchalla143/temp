ECG Study Date of [**2156-6-24**]  11:17:02 PM Possible atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and 2:1 block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2156-6-15**] the ventricular rate is faster.
Imaging: CXR [**2156-6-24**]:  A dual-lead cardiac pacing device is unchanged with leads in appropriate atrial and ventricular positions.
Multiple median sternotomy wires are stable as are vascular clips from coronary arterial bypass grafting.
Heart size is stable as are mediastinal and hilar contours.
Tagged RBC scan [**2156-6-25**]:  No active GI bleeding through 101 minutes.
TTE [**2156-6-28**]: Suboptimal image quality.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-6-10**], biventricular systolic function is now depressed.
LVEF = 30% .
U/S of b/l UE's and LE's [**2156-6-29**]: 1.
DVT of the right common femoral vein and superficial veins.
[**7-4**] Head CT: WNL  Micro: [**6-30**] Blood culture x 2: enterobacter cloacae (sensitive to ciprofloxacin) [**6-26**], [**6-30**] blood cx x 2: negative [**6-26**] stool culture: C.diff negative   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old woman with PMH s/f UGI bleeding, multiple DVTs, CAD s/p CABG, Afib/flutter, COPD, DM, s/p aortobifem bypass, ischemic colitis s/p colectomy, who was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 35589**] for UGI bleed and RUE DVT, presented on [**6-25**] with recurrent upper GI bleed, and whose hospital course has included Afib/flutter, persistent tachycardia, RUE and RLE DVT and LUE and LLE superficial thrombophlebitis, worsening CHF, UTI, delirium and diarrhea.
An EGD showed no active bleeding and 2 healing duodenal ulcers.
A tagged red cell scan was negative for active bleeding.
She intitially had a hematocrit of 31 and received 4U of PRBCs upon admission.
Her hematocrit was stable from [**6-26**] until the day of discharge, when it was 42.7.
Her anticoagulation was stopped and should be restarted in 4 weeks to treat her R UE DVT, R LE DVT, and likely PE.
Head CT was negative.
EKG and telemetry showed atrial flutter.
Her metoprolol was increased to 100 mg QID, which was tolerated by her blood pressure.
She did not have diarrhea after transfer to the floor and her C.diff toxin was negative.
DVTS/PE: Confirmed DVT in 3 of 4 limbs on doppler scan; pt likely with DVTs in [**2-29**] limbs; also with PE by V-Q scan.
CHF: Repeat Echo showed worsening heart failure with an EF of 30%, down from 55%.
She was aggressively diuresed with Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **], and her electrolytes were carefully followed.
Her electrolytes will need to be followed every 3 days.
UTI: The patient had an [**6-30**] urine culture that grew Enterobacter cloacae.
Her sugars were in the 150s to low 200s.
Htn: The patient's blood pressure was controlled with metoprolol 100 mg qid (also for rate control.
In addition, you were found to have an abnormal heart rhythm with a fast heart rate that was treated with medication.
Additional studies showed blood clots in your right leg and also in your lung.
