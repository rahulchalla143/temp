to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
He had a CT angiogram that was negative for a pulmonary embolus.
The patient on x-ray and exam was found to be in congestive heart failure, and received 40 mg of intravenous Lasix with some diuresis and improvement in his hypoxia on the ventilator in the Emergency Department.
Cardiac catheterization five years ago at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital with clean coronaries 3.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 95/69, heart rate 96, saturating 99% while on a ventilator set at AC, tidal volume 700, rate of 12 and PEEP of 10.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Exam is significant for extreme cyanosis of ears, cheeks and nose, as well as forehead.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  PT 15, PTT 31, INR 1.6.
White count 6.8, hematocrit 47.6, platelets 109, MCV 108.
Arterial blood gases 7.45, 33 and 298 while intubated.
Sodium 137, potassium 3.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate 23, BUN 16 and CT 1.0.
Glucose of 160.
Urinalysis with positive nitrites with greater than 300 protein and 4+ urobilinogen.
Alcohol level was 27.
AST was 169, ALT 152, alkaline phosphatase 102 and total bilirubin of 1.9 and direct of 0.7.
Magnesium was 2.0.
TSH was within normal limits.
First CK was 253.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with an ETT and right IJ in place.
CT angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus, cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions.
Echocardiogram on admission - left atrium was mildly dilated, severe global LV hypokinesis, severe global RV free wall hypokinesis, no right to left shunt and ejection fraction of about 20.
Electrocardiogram - initial was atrial fibrillation at a rate of 158 with left axis deviation and T-wave inversions from V4 to V6.
Electrocardiogram on arrival to the floor was normal sinus with left axis deviation, left atrial enlargement, RSR prime pattern and T-wave inversions in V1 through V6.
CARDIOVASCULAR: A.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient had previous cardiac catheterization five years ago that was within normal limits.
The patient had his cardiac enzymes cycled and he ruled out for myocardial infarction.
He had a cardiac catheterization on [**7-1**] which showed normal coronary arteries.
His ejection fraction was estimated to be 20% with severe hypokinesis on his echocardiogram and on his cardiac catheterization again his ejection fraction was estimated at about 25%.
He was initially found when the Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on the 19th to have a wedge of 30, cardiac output of 4.6 and an index of 1.99.
He was put on a po regimen for his congestive heart failure that included captopril 100 tid, aldactone 25 qd, Lasix 40 qd and ultimately carvedilol 3.125 [**Hospital1 **].
He then was in sinus rhythm initially on the floor and then went into atrial fibrillation again on the 19th with a rapid rate in the 150s.
Cardioversion was performed at both 200 and 300, and the patient failed.
He will be on anticoagulation, discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.0.
His heart rate was well controlled on this regimen.
His acidosis improved while intubated.
He had hepatitis serologies sent which had positive hepatitis C antibody as well as positive hepatitis B surface antibody indicating previous immunization.
He also had iron studies with an elevated ferritin, but all other values were within normal limits.
His liver function tests did diminish during his hospital stay, but did not return to normal prior to discharge.
On day of discharge, his ALT was 102, AST 99, alkaline phosphatase 84, bilirubin 2.3, albumin 3.4.
His ferritin was 844 with an INR of 127 and a TIBC of 278.
Hepatology service was consulted in regards to the patient's abnormal liver function tests and his positive hepatitis C serology.
He also had a right abdominal ultrasound which showed a coarse nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] is aware that the patient will be discharged on anticoagulation and is okay with a goal INR in the low range of 2.0.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was initially thrombocytopenic and his platelets remained fairly stable in the low normal range.
His iron studies showed elevated ferritin, but all others were within normal limits.
He was premedicated with Mucomyst and hydrated for his cardiac catheterization and on the day of discharge, his creatinine was 1.2.
He was sent home with a five day supply of Indocin and his renal function should be monitored.
Hepatitis C 3.
Cirrhosis 4.
Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneous [**Hospital1 **] until INR is therapeutic at 2.0.
Coumadin 2.5 po qd adjusting to keep an INR of 2.0.
The patient needs his INR followed which should be done at the [**Hospital 197**] clinic.
