CTA Head and Neck: CT OF THE HEAD: No edema, mass, mass effect, hemorrhage or infarction is detected.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND THE NECK: The vertebral and carotid arteries and their branches are patent with no significant mural irregularity or flow-limiting stenosis.
CT PERFUSION: No abnormality of cerebral blood flow, blood volume or the mean transit time within the middle cerebral artery vascular territory.
Limited imaging of the basilar artery is performed.
Findings consistent with infarct in the distal right ACA territory, not visualized on prior CT perfusion study.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
He received IV tPA at 3 am and was admitted to ICU initially where he remained stable with improving L sided weakness and no hemorrhagic transformation confirmed with repeat CT the next day.
MRI showed L ACA distribution stroke likely embolic in nature given Afib and subtherapeutic INR.
Echo was performed no obvious thrombus with LVEF 50~55% and no PFO/ASD.
Lovenox should be stopped when INR is therapeutic from 2.0-3.0.
Patient's INR was 1.6 on the day of discharge to rehab facility.
Patient was also started on Simvastatin 40mg for LDL of 170.

Outpatient Lab Work Daily INR until INR between 2~3 and stable - may need to adjust Coumadin dosing based on INR.
Once INR stable and Coumadin dosing fixed, may need to space out the lab checks.
Currently being bridged with ASA 81mg once daily and Lovenox 90 twice daily while INR subtherapeutic.
INR 1.6 on the day of discharge.
You were initially admitted to the ICU where you were monitored and treated including follow-up CT of head which did not show hemorrhagic transformation.
