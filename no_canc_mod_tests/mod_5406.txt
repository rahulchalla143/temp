Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
-CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2171-10-17**] 9:25 AM Focal faint opacities in the right costophrenic angle, most likely representing pleural effusion and atelectasis noted on the recent abdominal CT scan.
Her nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain resolved within one day of starting the broad spectrum antibiotics and she tolerated a regular diabetic and cardiac prudent diet throughout her hospital stay.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for hepatobiliary abnormalities.
Their gynecologic exam was negative and the surgical suture felt to be intact.
Abdominal CT with contrast and MRI showed right-sided hydroureter of the native kidney and a large central pelvic cyst (larger than on preoperative ultrasound).
Chest x ray revealed developed right middle and lower lobe infiltrates.
Microbiological data was negative for multiple blood cultures, including fungal cultures.
Urine cultres were negative for growth except for culture [**10-20**] which grew 10-[**Numeric Identifier 4856**] yeast.
However, urine cultures were obtained after starting antibiotic therapy.
Vaginal swab was negative for bacterial vaginosis.
Cryptococcus antigen, CMV antibody, toxoplamosis, and monospot were all negative.
Urine was negative for legionella antigen.
It is also possible that the enlarging pelvic cyst has a communication with the ureter, although this has not been demonstrated on CT or MRI.
Serial urinalyses demonstrated reduction of wbc's over time and the final urine culture obtained was negative.
PELVIC CYST: The differential diagnosis on MRI included ovarian cyst vs. a urinoma or lymphocele in patient who is status post renal transplant.
There was no initial chest x ray performed at admission.
Chest xray showed small, bilateral effusions that were resolving.
Sputum culture was contaminated.
INCREASED CREATININE: Creatinine increased over the past 2 months from 2.2 to a peak of 3.3, with an unclear role of the enlarging pelvic fluid mass and pyelonephritis.
Repeat urinalysis included sterile pyuria (>1000 WBC).
Acute on chronic renal failure was possibly secondary to the obstruction; however, it is not clear if the native kidney plays any role in the analysis of creatinine clearance.
Urine output was uncompromised during the hosptial course and the transplanted kidney appeared in good condition on imaging.
HCT increased from 27 to 31 after 2 units PRBCs on [**10-15**].
