Admission Date:  [**2183-6-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2183-6-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2124-5-28**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (status post inferoposterolateral myocardial infarction in [**2179**]), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who was transferred from [**Hospital3 15175**] to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2183-6-6**] for a cardiac catheterization.
In [**2179**], the patient's cardiac catheterization revealed an occluded right coronary artery and circumflex with moderate-to-diffuse disease along the left anterior descending artery.
During the presentation, the patient's BNT was elevated to 459, and the patient's Persantine thallium showed an inferolateral defect; at which time the patient was referred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 188**] showed 60% to 70% ostial left main, left anterior descending artery with 80% and 70% mid, left circumflex to mid, right coronary artery to mid, both collateralized from left.
Ejection fraction was in the high 40s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination at the time of discharge revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97.3, heart rate was 63 (sinus), blood pressure was 177/90, respiratory rate was 16, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric.
The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The staples were intact along the sternotomy incision site, and no evidence of erythema or serosanguineous drainage were noted.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel sounds.
Lower extremity examination revealed there was no evidence of edema noted in the lower extremities, and the graft site showed no evidence of erythema or serosanguineous drainage.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  Pertinent laboratories on [**2183-6-17**] revealed white blood cell count was 18.3, hematocrit was 26.7, and platelets were 424.
Sodium was 136, potassium was 4.8, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen was 14, and creatinine was 0.7.
Magnesium was 2.1 and calcium was 9.4.
Prothrombin time was 15.3, partial thromboplastin time was 57.2, and INR was 1.6.
However, the patient developed acute shortness of breath, elevated BNT, and Persantine thallium demonstrated mixed inferolateral defect with corresponding cardiac catheterization revealing 60% to 70% left main disease, left anterior descending artery with 80% disease, with an ejection fraction in the high 40% range.
Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit for close monitoring and was promptly extubated without difficulty.
The patient maintained good oxygen saturations on 3 liters nasal cannula and maintained good urine output after weaning off of pressors.
Electrophysiology consultation revealed that the parameters were in the acceptable range with evidence of full energy charge in the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
By postoperative day two, the patient again required a moderate amount of Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support, and the patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation to which the patient was initiated on an amiodarone drip.
As the patient maintained good oxygen saturations along with good pressures without further support.
At this time, the patient's amiodarone was discontinued as the patient maintained a sinus rhythm, and sotalol was re-initiated.
The patient will require a prothrombin time and INR check every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
