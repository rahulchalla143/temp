PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: 1.
The patient was taken immediately postoperatively to the Interventional Neuroradiology Suite where the patient underwent a cerebral angiogram which was negative for any evidence of intracerebral ischemia.

A KUB film showed colon full of contrast from his swallow study.
On postoperative day number nine, the patient's INR reached 2.2 and the heparin drip was discontinued.
