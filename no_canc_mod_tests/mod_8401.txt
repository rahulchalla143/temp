[**2183-7-8**] - UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Heart is normal in size with a left ventricular configuration.
Pulmonary vascularity is normal, and the lungs are clear.
[**2183-7-8**] HEAD CT - There is no evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage.
1) Hypotension - In the ED, he transiently dropped his systolic blood pressures into the mid 90s, resulting in ICU admission.
Upon further review of his past records, this blood pressure appears to be near his baseline.
He did not demonstrate any shock physiology, and continued to mentate well with normal urine output despite this.
After admission, his blood pressures were consistently stable in the low 100s-130s systolic.
2) Fever - possible sources included the basilar atelectasis vs aspiration pneumonia seen on abdominal CT (but patient was without cough, shortness of breath, tachypnea); his L knee effusion (found to be gout on arthrocentesis), blood cultures (growing sparse G+ cocci, coag negative in [**2-7**] bottles, thought to be a contaminant), or a urine which grew out 10,000 CFU of enterococci (with no pyuria on his UA).
He also had an LP in the ED which was negative.
Per ID reccs (who are familiar with the patient) and ECHO was obtained to r/o endocarditis.
The patient was discharged on an additional 7 day course of amoxicillin for his enterococcus UTI, repeat u/a showed no bacteria or WBCs.
This rapidly improved with IVF, his urine electrolytes showed a FeNA < 0.01, and was therefore attributed to prerenal azotemia.
His creatinine remained stable throughout the rest of his admission.
