Work-up at the outside hospital revealed cholestasis of unknown etiology.

LFT's were consistent with a cholestatic picture, but U/S, MRCP, and CT of abdomen were unrevealing with possible gallstone ileus.
She was rapidly tapered off steroid on presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**], where the patient continued to have persistent fevers with maximum temperatures of 104 farenheit.
Urine culture was positive for vancomycin sensitive enterococcus five days after admission; antibiotics were not changed with this result given the above regimen.
Blood cultures were taken serially in an attempt to isolate an organism responsible for the patient's fevers, but all cultures to date were negative.
With respect to diagnostic studies, several were performed and findings are as follows.
CT abdomen/pelvis  revealed a low density fatty liver with ascites.
MR abdomen revealed an abnormal heterogeneous enhancement pattern of the liver, which was interpreted as a nonspecific finding which can be seen in cases of acute viral and toxic hepatitis.
Ultrasound guided paracentesis was performed as well which revealed a gradient of 1.1 consistent with cirrhosis and borderline transudative process.
A hepatitis panel was negative.
A difficult ultrasound guided liver biopsy was performed which revealed marked steatosis with abundant intracellular hyalin and neutrophilic reaction.
Trichrome stain showed prominent sinusoidal fibrosis, without cirrhosis.
Iron stain showed no definite stainable iron.
Despite these studies, the patient continued to spike fevers accompanied by mental status changes, but blood cultures continued to be negative.
CT abdomen was repeated which again revealed no evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
The patient continued to spike and blood cultures were positive for gram negative rods.
Vancomycin, flayl, and zosyn were started, gram negative rod coverage.
The patient's blood pressure simultaneously dropped and she was unable to defend her blood pressures with aggressive fluid boluses.
In the intensive care unit, the patient did not require pressors to maintain her blood pressure because she responded well to several liters of iv fluids.
TEE was performed which was negative for endocarditis.
Repeat CT was performed on [**11-15**] which showed no abscess.
4)FULL CODE  5)Dispo: pending resolution of fevers/etiology of cholestasis  ***Needs follow-up in [**3-17**] months with CT or MRI for ?adrenal mass.
