Electrocardiogram with normal axis and normal sinus rhythm.
Chest x-ray, PA and lateral, without any acute disease, infiltrates, or failure.
Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated fatty infiltration of liver with several small gallbladder polyps and no gallstones.
Her renal function improved over the course of time from a creatinine of 1.8 to a creatinine of 0.4.
She had two blood cultures from the outside hospital positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus which was sensitive to Clindamycin.
Multiple tests were done including CMV, EBV, which were all negative, and surveillance blood cultures on [**10-8**], [**10-12**], [**10-13**], and [**10-17**] were all without any growth to date.
Blood cultures were also sent for .................. organisms, and there has been no growth to date of these organisms.
The patient was seen and followed by Oral Surgery, and they felt that the source of her staph bacteremia was unlikely from her dental issues which they felt were more consistent with cellulitis and not an abscess.
Transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography were within normal limits and did not demonstrate any vegetations on exam.
The patient was begun on Oxacillin as her bacteremia was sensitive to Oxacillin on [**10-11**] and will complete a 14-day course of Oxacillin.
She was followed by the Infectious Disease Services while in-house and for the last two days of her hospitalization has been afebrile with normal white blood cell count and no fever spikes.

Heme:  The patient had a low hematocrit noted during the course of the admission with iron studies demonstrating normal iron but lower TIBC and an elevated MCV.
The patient also underwent abdominal CT to rule out intra-abdominal source of abscess, splenic infarct, or colitis, which may be contributing to her fever spikes.
Infectious Disease Service recommended one week more of Oxacillin to treat the coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus that was noted on blood cultures at the outside hospital.
