Pain was [**10-9**] at the time and associated with N/V.
WBC was 10.1, lipase was >3000.
She had a CT scan of her abd/pelvis that revealed enlarged and hyperemic pancreas with surrounding fat stranding and associated retroperitoneal effusion without a well-defined pseudocyst.
CBD was 1 cm.
Repeat CT scan obtained and showed persistent peripancreatic stranding and fluid.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for mgmt of severe pancreatic necrosis.

[**2162-8-22**] Chest/ Abd CT :   1.
Extensive peripancreatic fluid shows no significant change since prior CT. Areas of non-enhancement in the pancreatic body consistent with necrosis.
[**2162-8-31**] Abdominal CT : IMPRESSION:  1.
The extent of inflammation surrounding the pancreas has improved but the large peripancreatic fluid collection is unchanged in size when compared to prior CT of [**2162-8-18**].
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and non surgical management of pancreatitis.
[**8-16**] - [**8-17**] - PICC line placed, TPN started, continued NPO, supportive management [**8-18**] - The patient had an episode of desaturation, CT scan performed demonstrating pancreatitis with large peripancreatic fluid collection tracking around the liver, pericolic gutters, and mesentery.
She underwent a RUQ ultrasound which demonstrated gallstones, minimal fluid around the gallbladder, no evidence of cholecystitis.
Due to her confusion, the patient needed to be intubated so a central line and arterial line were placed.
A CTA chest was performed which did not demonstrate a pulmonary embolus.
She had blood cultures and a urine culture done at this time.
The blood cultures were positive for enterobacter and the urine culture was positive for EColi.
Once on floor, patient's clinical exam improved.
Her TPN was eventually discontinued as she was tolerating a regular low fat diet.
While on Meropenem she had another temperature spike to 102 prompting removal of her PICC line and blood and urine cultures were done again.
Currently the blood cultures remain negative, The PICC line tip is negativa as is a urine culture.
She underwent a repeat abdominal CT which was essentially unchanged.
