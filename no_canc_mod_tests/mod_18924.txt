A stress test was planning for the near future.
Patient arrived to [**Hospital1 18**], cath showing elevated filling pressures, LMCA mild dz, LAD 60-70 mid, LCx 90% mid, occ OM, RCA occluded distally which was stented with Cypher DES with normal residual flow.

Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CARDIAC CATH [**2139-5-12**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The LMCA showed mild 20% stenosis without evidence of flow limitation.
The LAD showed a 60% midsegment stenosis.
The LCx showed a 90% discrete midsegment stenosis with an occluded OM branch.
The RCA showed a  thrombotic distal segment occlusion.
Limited hemodynamic studies demonstrated normal cardiac index of 2.9 L/min/m2 (cardiac output 5.6 L/min).
The right atrial filling pressure was mildly elevated at 11 mmHg with borderline elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 14 mmHg.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation.
Borderline elevated right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures with normal cardiac output.
Cardiac enzymes peaked on [**5-13**] (CK-770, MB-72, MBI 9.4).
Dr.[**Name (NI) 8664**] office is to call patient with a f/u appointment within the next 2 weeks, and he will consider a stress test ([**6-28**] wks) as an outpatient to better eval the LAD lesion.
3) Pump: Echo as above, EF >55%, has remained euvolemic, with no symptoms of heart failure.
3) Hyperlipidemia: Lipids per patient normal with total cholesterol 150.
5) Abdominal discomfort: Recent had a recent diagnosis of gallstones, no fever.
Large protuberant abdomen was difficult to assess.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted when necessary.
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good, hemodynamically stable, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of chest pain.
You underwent cardiac catheterization for which a drug eluting stent was placed to open one of your arteries.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT that you take your Plavix every day to prevent blood clots from forming.
