Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.4.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
A focal deficit cannot be completely excluded due to poor image quality.
Post CPB: The cardiac output is 7 L/min on epinephrine infusion.
The mitral valve has a mean gradient of 6mmHg and a peak gradient of 11mmHg.
The aortic valve area is 2.0cm2 using the continuity equation; Vmax 212cm/s, peak gradient 19mmHg, mean gradient is 9mmHg.
CT scan 1.
Based on the ultrasound examination of [**2133-8-19**], the interpolar lesion in the left kidney appears to represent a cyst, and based on its density today, a hemorrhagic cyst.
A CT scan was obtained which did not show any metastatic disease that would delay surgery and a delayed workup was recommended.
A repeat scan in 3 months was recommened.
It was again felt that work-up of this should not delay his cardiac surgery.
A fine needle aspiration was recommended as an outpatient.
