Initial blood glucose was 44, then 70, and 73 on feedings.
He was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and treatment.
On admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, his oxygen saturations were noted to be in the low 80 percent range.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION TO THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  Weight 4.410 kg, length 21 cm, head circumference 36.5 cm all parameters greater than 90th percentile for gestational age.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat:  Soft anterior fontanel, intact palate, normal facies.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:  Respiratory:  [**Location (un) 22627**] initially required 1 liter of nasal cannula oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations greater than 94 percent.
At the time of discharge, his respiratory rates are 40-60/minute.
He had an arterial blood gas upon admission with a pH of 7.29, PCO2 of 43, and a PO2 of 82.
A chest x-ray obtained shortly after admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit showed confluent parenchymal opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes, and a small right pleural effusion.
The clinical presentation and chest x-ray were consistent with neonatal pneumonia, and he was treated with a seven day course of antibiotics.
Cardiovascular:  [**Location (un) 22627**] has maintained normal heart rates and blood pressures.
At the time of discharge, his weight is 4.395 kg.
At the time of admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, a white blood cell count was 3,900 with a differential of 31 percent polymorphonuclear cells, 16 band neutrophils, 2 metamyelocytes for an immature to total ratio of 0.36.
A blood culture was obtained prior to starting intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin.
The blood culture was no growth at 72 hours.
A lumbar puncture was performed on day of life number one and had 2 white cells per high power field with 12 percent polymorphonuclear cells, 41 percent lymphocytes, 35 percent monocytes, 1 eosinophil, and 11 macrophages.
There were no organisms seen on the Gram stain, and the cerebrospinal culture was no growth.
Gastrointestinal:  Peak serum bilirubin occurred on day of life number two, total of 8.5/0.3 mg/dl direct.
A repeat serum bilirubin on day of life four was a total of 7.5/0.3 mg/dl.
Hematological:  Hematocrit at birth was 59.3 percent.
The complete blood count was repeated on day of life number two with an increase in white count to 21.8 percent and a more normal differential of 67 percent polys and 0 percent bands.
Repeat hematocrit at that time was 59.1 percent.
[**Location (un) 22627**] did not receive any transfusions of blood products.
Car seat position screening was performed secondary to initial oxygen requirement.
[**Location (un) 22627**] was monitored in his car seat for 90 minutes, and did not have any episodes of oxygen desaturation or bradycardia.
State newborn screen was sent on [**2137-8-23**] with no notification of abnormal results to date.
