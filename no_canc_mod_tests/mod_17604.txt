An EKG was ordered and was unremarkable.
Serial troponins were sent and negative for any ischemic cardiac event.
He was given three separate 500cc boluses of normal saline over the next several hours as well as 2 units of packed red cells, with a goal hematocrit of >30 given his cardiac history.
He was transferred to the ICU for continued care overnight, where he remained off pressors with systolic blood pressure in the low 90's.
His urine output increased as well to 20-30cc per hour.
His pressures responded well to blood transfusions and his Hct rose appropriately.
