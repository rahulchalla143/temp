TTE [**2183-4-11**]: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with basal inferolateral and inferior hypokinesis.
CT abd [**2183-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1) Dense bilateral lower lobe and right middle lobe consolidations, in a pattern most consistent with aspiration pneumonitis.
He was administered antibiotics in the ED after cultures were obtained and was given IV fluids through his dialyisis line.
CT abdomen and plain films of his foot were obtained to rule out intra-abdominal and osteomyelitis as possible sources of infection.
The team considered non-invasive ventilation vs intubation and ultimately decided to try the non-invasive strategy with the plan to take some additional volume off with the CVVH to improve his SOB.
He was noted to have a pulse in regular rhythm, although blood pressure was unable to be measured due to his poor vascular status, a measurement was not able to be attempted.
