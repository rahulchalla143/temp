The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Dyspnea: Exam and course most consistent with COPD exacerbation, was initially in MICU for BIPAP, but weaned off within approx 24 hrs to his home 3L O2 after initiation of nebs, IV steroids, azithromycin.
Given history of CAD and LE edema initially was concerning for CHF, but no history of orthopnea or PND and TTE showed nl global systolic function, EF>55% although it was a study limited by image quality.
EKG unchanged from baseline.
# HTN: pt has been hypertensive with diastolic BP around 100 recently.
Your heart echo did not show any evidence of heart failure.
