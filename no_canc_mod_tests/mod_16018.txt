CT of the head there showed a large left frontoparietal bleed with mass effect.
She was hyperventilated but no Mannitol was given there and she was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for further care.
After being admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] NSICU, her examination was unchanged throughout from the outside hospital examination.
She was seen by the neurosurgery consult team who felt that a ventricular drain was not warranted and unlikely to be beneficial even though there was evidence of small interventricular bleeding and some falcine herniation seen on the repeat head CT here.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.3, axillary blood pressure 194/80, heart rate 94, oxygen saturation 95% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - There is no scleral icterus.
On motor examination, her left leg withdraws with hip flexion and painful stimulus.
LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count was 11.2, hematocrit 34.3, MCV 89, platelet count 188,000.
Partial thromboplastin time 21.3, INR 1.1.
Her glucose is 109, blood urea nitrogen 19, creatinine 0.4, sodium 143, potassium 3.0, chloride 111, bicarbonate 23, albumin 3.1.
Her microbiology studies included urine culture which was positive for Streptococcus povus.
Sputum culture is positive for Oxacillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus that is coagulase positive.
There are two out of four blood cultures from [**2104-8-24**], from the same set growing coagulase negative Staphylococcus with subsequent surveillance cultures that are negative.
Right hemiparesis with aphasia - The patient's examination is consistent with the left frontoparietal as well as temporal lobe impairment likely due to the edema from the hemorrhage.
The blood cultures were felt to be a contaminant since surveillance cultures were negative and the patient continued to be afebrile on the antibiotics.
Tube feeds are Promote with fiber full strength with starting rate of 20ml/hour to advance to a goal rate of 60ml/hour by 20ml every six hours.
