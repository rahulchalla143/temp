Asymmetric density in the right upper lobe and right paratracheal region merits further evaluation on a followup chest radiograph after diuresis to exclude right upper lobe infection and right paratracheal adenopathy.
[**2146-11-22**] CXR:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, a small left pleural effusion, small retrocardiac atelectasis and evidence of mild overhydration.
The pre-existing right upper lobe and perihilar parenchymal opacities unchanged in extent.
Coronary angiography demonstrated the following: LMCA 100% proximal occluded and RCA 100% proximally occluded.
Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a patent left internal mammary artery to the LAD.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a SBP of 135 mmHg and a DBP 56 mmHg.
Right heart cardiac catheterization revealed the following pressures (mmHg): RA 19, RV [**2107-8-24**], PA 71/32/49 and PCWP 31.
Fick cardiac output was 4.79 L/min and Fick cardiac index was 2.58 L/min/m2.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no angiographically apparent dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the stent.
Presented to OSH with NSTEMI, trop peak of 16.5, CK 513.
Difficult to assess EKG changes due to LBBB, troponin bumped up to 1.1->1.33, CKs flat.
The patient underwent cardiac cath on [**11-21**] after she became hemodynamically stable, which revealed PCW 31, PA 49, LMCA 100% proximal, RCA 100% proximal, Y graft with limb to RCA proximally occluded and limb to OM 95% proximal stenosis; other vein probably stump occluded; BMS was placed in OM graft.
Post-cath course complicated by Right groin tenderness on post-cath day 6; ultrasound revealed no fistula or pseudoaneurysm, and symptoms resolved.
# PUMP: Worsening LV function; LVEF reported to be 61% from OSH, chronic diastolic CHF with chronically elevated BNP per outside records.
Our echo revealed LVEF of 20-25%.
Hct dropped to trough of 26.8, received 1 uPRBC while in CCU prior to cath.
Hct 27 on day of discharge; she was transitioned to PO PPI, will have her continue as outpatient.
She was noted to desaturate to mid 80s with ambulation; she notes no history of this, and her ambulatory sats improved with diuresis to the low 90s.
Cardiac cath was initially deferred for hemoptysis, but pulmonary cleared her for cath and her hemoptysis improved throughout admission despite ongoing anticoagulation.
Patient will require PFT and pulmonology follow-up as an outpatient; no need for repeat imaging per pulm and radiology as the abnormal finding at OSH consistent with ectatic vasculature involving the aorta.
# CRI: unknown baseline, Cr 1.4 at OSH, 1.6 the AM of discharge.
Will have labs drawn later this week.
Hilar adenopathy: found on chest CT at OSH.
All cultures to date negative.
)(s)* Refills:*0* 5. nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain: Can give up to 3 times, 5 minutes apart.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check serum sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, calcium, and magnesium.
We had difficulty with performing your cardiac catheterization due to the blood tinged sputum that you developed while on heparin and the blood we found in your stool.
There was question of concerning findings on your chest CT scan from the outside hospital; however, upon further review of the images by the radiologists and pulmonologists, it appears that the abnormal finding is due to a bundle of blood vessels.
You will not require follow-up imaging of your chest.
However, it has been recommended that you have pulmonary function tests performed as an outpatient.
You should have your labs checked on Thursday, [**12-1**] and the results faxed to Dr.[**Name (NI) 88490**] office.
