Patient's EF as reported by echo in [**2102**] and in [**2104-7-6**] was stable at 30-35%.
As a result, an ICD was placed [**2104-6-5**] for what was believed to be symptomatic a fib.
Patient was recently found by his cardiologist to have a low BP in the upper 70's and upper 80's, and his Lisinopril was discontinued and Lasix was stopped.
During his hospital stay at the OSH 2 days prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 18**], per family, patient developed hypothermia of 90 degrees F. Family reports that patient was wrapped in multiple blankets at the hospital, and his temperature increased to 92 degrees F. .
CXR was obtained at OSH on [**9-23**] which showed cardiomegaly with fine bibasilar markings.
An echo obtained [**9-23**] at OSH showed worsened MR (3+) with worsened EF ~15%.
CT chest with IV contrast was obtained at the OSH as well, which resulted in elevation of patient's Cr from baseline of 0.9-1.5 to 3.4. .
On presentation, he was mildly dyspneic on 3L O2 NC with sats in the low 90's.
No PCI (most recent cardiac catheterization [**2084**]) .
ICD placed [**2104-6-5**] for symptoms attributed to atrial fibrillation.

CXR on Admission [**2104-9-24**]: There is no comparison available.
Echocardiogram ([**2104-9-24**]): The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
CHEST CT WITHOUT CONTRAST IMPRESSION ([**2104-9-29**]): 1.
Superimposed ground-glass opacities can be seen in the setting of pulmonary hemorrhage, which would be consistent with given history of hemoptysis.
Several noncalcified pulmonary nodules, largest measuring 10 mm, three- month followup chest CT is recommended.
Basal bronchiectasis, which can be seen in the setting of chronic aspiration.
CXR on discharge [**2104-10-5**]: Comparison with the previous study done [**2104-10-2**].
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 83 year old male with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with newly further depressed ejection fraction, severe mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation status post failed cardioversion in [**2104-6-5**], status-post ICD/pace-maker, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of dypsnea and his cardiac problems.
His laboratories were remarkable for creatinine of 4.1, sodium of 132, and INR of 3.4.
Hospital course is as followed by system:  #) Congestive heart failure, history of ischemic cardiomyopathy: Per report from patient's outside hospital, an echocardiogram was completed prior to transfer that demonstrated a worsened ejection fraction of 15%, with severe mitral regurgitation (as compared to echocardiogram from [**2104-6-5**] where his EF was approximately 30% and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**]).
A chest x-ray was completed at admission as well as a bedside echocardiogram, which confirmed the above findings.
Patient was started on a lasix drip after he failed to diuresis to lasix boluses on night of admission; a goal urine output of 60cc/hr was maintained.
The next day, patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit for further monitoring and possible Swanz placment given that he was still very dyspneic with minimal exertion (eg moving in bed) and possible ionotropic support for diuresis.
It was also felt that a tranesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), followed by cardioversion if no clot was seen, would also be of benefit to give the patient better cardiac output with "atrial kick."
He underwent a TEE with subsequent cardioversion on [**2104-10-3**] and again reported improvement in his symptoms.
At time of discharge, his weight was down over 4 kilograms.
An ace-inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **] was not started due to his renal function, which improved but continued to be variable.
Given concern for acute gastrointestinal bleeding from either an upper or lower source, patient's anti-coagulation was held (he had been on a heparin drip after his INR was <2.0); his diuresis and beta-blocker were temporarily stopped.
The gastroenterology team was consulted for further evaluation, and on [**2104-10-2**], the patient underwent upper endoscopy and colonoscopy.
Records were obtained from the patient's prior colonoscopy, which was from [**2099**], demonstrating no significant findings.
Biopsies of the gastric mucosa and h. pylori serologies were pending at time of discharge and should be followed up.
The prior bleeding was felt to likely be due to gastritis or an ulcer, which had resolved.
He had no further episodes of bleeding and his hematocrit remained stable.
#) Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Based on records accompanying patient, his baseline creatinine appears to range between 0.9 - 1.4 until [**2104-6-5**], at which time it was in the mid 2's.
It was felt that he likely had acute tubular necrosis from the contrast given to the patient for a CTA done prior to his transfer, coupled with his low flow state due to his decompensated congestive heart failure.
His creatinine peaked at 4.4, and then stabalized in the 1.7 to 2.3 range.
A pulmonary consult was obtained for further evaluation and recommendations regarding anticoagulation.
His hemoptysis improved and resolved as his INR normalized.
His outside imaging, including the CTA of this chest was reviewed, and a repeat CAT scan without contrast was obtained after diuresis to rule out any signs of malignancy, given his long tobacco use history and asbestosis exposure.
Patient should have a repeat chest CT in three months to follow up.
Repeat CAT scan as noted in results.
#) Elevated INR: Patient's Coumadin was held beginning [**9-21**], however his INR was still 3.4 at admission.
He was given vitamin K to further lower his INR in the event that he needed any procedures.
He was maintained on a heparin drip after his gastrointestinal work-up and bridged back to coumadin.
His INR was 1.9 on the day of discharge.
Iron studies were obtained and revealed an iron of 26, TIBC of 286, ferritn 260, and transferritin of 220.
He did not receive any blood transfusions, and his hematocrit remained stable in the 28-32 range.
#) HTN: Patient's blood pressure has been in low 100's and high 90's since admission, likely due to his heart failure.
He had no problems with hypertension during his stay, and his blood pressure actually remained on the low side, without symptoms.
#) Urinary tract infection: Patient was noted to have an urine analysis consistent with infection.
You also underwent an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy to ensure you had no active gastrointestinal bleeding.
You will also need to have pulmonary function tests completed and have an eye exam when you return to your home town while on amiodarone.
Please weigh yourself every morning, and call your physician if your weight increases more than 3 lbs.
Please adhere to 2 gram sodium diet, and limit your fluid intake to 1500 mL daily.
In addition to general cardiac follow-up, your [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacemaker will be checked at this appointment.
You should have your INR (coumadin level) checked regularly (weekly at first given changes in your medications).
