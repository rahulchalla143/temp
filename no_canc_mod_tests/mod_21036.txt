In the ED, her initial VS were: afebrile, P 134, BP 78/48, O2 sat 95%.
Her pulse decreased to the 110s and her BP increased to 80s-90s.
She also had a CXR, which was concerning for retrocardiac opacity v. atelectasis.
She had abdominal tenderness on physical exam, so a CT abdomen was performed prior to admission.
On admission, her VS were BP 98/53, P 110, R 16, O2 100% on NRB, CVP 18. .

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-2-8**] atrial fibrillation is new.
[**2133-3-12**] CT HEAD: 1.
These appear larger from examination of [**2127**] and could represent lymph nodes.
Correlation with oncologic history or further workup with possible MRI of the neck is recommended.
[**2133-3-12**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
If further imaging is indicated, HIDA scan may be performed.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
[**2133-3-19**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
Pulmonary edema, which is improved since [**2133-3-17**].
[**2133-3-20**] CT Abdomen: IMPRESSION: 1.
Mottled perfusion of the liver could be secondary to congestive heart failure in the setting of a prominent atrium and mitral regurgitation.
Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 and L5.
Discharge Labs: Na 135, K 3.7, Cl 100, HCO3 27, BUN 8, Cr 0.5, Glucose 9, Ca 9, Mg 1.9, P 2.6, WBC 11.9, Hgb 10.2, HCT 29.7, Platelets 519  Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo woman with h/o dementia, recurrent UTIs, and recent CVA, who presented with AMS and hypotension in the setting of urosepsis.
Urosepsis: Ms. [**Known lastname **] U/A was concerning for infection and CT Abdomen/Pelvis showed a R ureteral stone with associated stranding and free fluid in the RP and lower abdomen consistent with forniceal rupture.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] urine culture and blood cultures grew out E. coli with sensitivies as above and she was narrowed to ceftriaxone.
Her blood pressures were initially managed with levophed, transitioned to neosynephrine given tachycardia and gradually weaned.
Her condition improved with placement of the stent as did her renal function.
Patient had repeat imaging concerning for pyelonephritis and had UA consistent with infection in right kidney.
Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: Per report, Ms. [**Known lastname **] does not require O2 at baseline, but was found to require 2L NC at her nursing home the morning of admission.
She had an ECHO showing diastolic CHF.
She was diuresed with IV lasix and her oxygen requirement resolved and her exam improved.
At discharge Ms. [**Known lastname **] had O2 saturation of 97% on RA.
[**Last Name (un) **]: The patient's creatinine was 2.0, which is increased from her baseline of 0.7.
Creatinine at discharge returned to baseline of 0.5 .
Enlarged Gallbladder: On physical exam, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had RUQ tenderness, and her CT abdomen demonstrated a significantly enlarged gallbladder.
A RUQ U/S was performed, which did not demonstrate significant GB wall edema, and her LFTs are still within normal limits.
Start Ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 24 hours.
