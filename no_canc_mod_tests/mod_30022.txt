On arrival, EKG showed inferior ST elevations.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization that showed one vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics showed markedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with pseudo-constrictures in a pattern indicative of right ventricular infarction.
Post PTCA he had hypotension and he was transiently started on dopamine at 5 mcg and transiently went into atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 116.
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations in 2, 3 and aVF, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] in aVL, 0.
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation in V3 through V4 and right-sided leads with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V4R consistent with proximal right coronary artery involvement with right ventricular involvement.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 15.7, hematocrit 32.3, hemoglobin 11.2, MCV 86, platelet count 199, sodium 135, potassium 4.4, BUN 22, creatinine 1, glucose 144, chloride 103, bicarb 22.
First CK 6,273 on presentation.
Initial MB was 702.
MB index 11.2 down to 13 and 1.1 on day of discharge.
Calcium 8.3, phos 2.8, magnesium 1.9.
Total cholesterol 124, triglycerides 307, HDL 34, LDL 29.
Had serial EKGs and serial CK's.
EKGs toward discharge had resolving ST changes and CK decreased from 6,000 to 1000 on the 8th.
The patient was also started on ACE inhibitor leaving on 5 mg of Zestril and a statin of 10 of Lipitor.
His cholesterol needs following as an outpatient for levels that were not reflected by his acute hemodynamics.
For the first 24 hours he was needy requiring 250 cc boluses of normal saline to maintain his blood pressure above a systolic of 90, however, on the second day of hospitalization, this was no longer necessary and patient was hemodynamically stable.
Had an echocardiogram with the following information:  Left ventricular septal wall thickness 1.4 cm, his ejection fraction was 30%, PR gradient was 15 mm, left atrium was mildly dilated, right atrium was normal in size, mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy, normal LV size, overall left ventricular function was mildly depressed.
The patient was seen by the Electrophysiology Service and had a signal averaged electrocardiogram which showed him to be at a high risk level.
