Prenatal screens were unremarkable including hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, antibody negative, Rubella immune, blood type B positive.
There was no maternal fever and Group B Streptococcus status was unknown.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Apgars were 8 at one minute and 8 at five minutes.
Birthweight was 3105 gm, length 20 inches, head circumference 34 cm.
Initial examination was otherwise unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's tachypnea persisted into his second day of life and he was transferred to the [**Name (NI) **] Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation to rule out causes other than retained fetal lung fluid.
Evaluation included an unremarkable complete blood count and blood culture which has remained negative at the time of dictation.
Normal electrocardiogram and hyperoxia test and a chest x-ray with diffuse bilateral interstitial markings consistent with retained fetal lung fluid versus pneumonia.
Because the patient required oxygen briefly during his [**Name (NI) **] Intensive Care Unit stay for oxygen saturations in the low 90s and because of repeat chest x-ray on day of life #3 revealed no improvement in the interstitial markings, he was treated with a week of ampicillin and gentamicin intravenously for presumed pneumonia.
Gentamicin levels were 10.8 peak and 0.7 trough, and as noted blood cultures remained negative.
He passed hearing screening in both ears both initially and prior to discharge.
Bilirubin level on [**2119-4-8**] was 8.5 and was not repeated as the patient remained only mildly clinically jaundiced.
Weight on [**2119-4-12**] is 2920 gm.
