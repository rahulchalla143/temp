His last echocardiogram in [**2157**] showed an ejection fraction of 35%.
The patient was also started on intravenous normal saline, and his blood pressures hovered at around 100 systolic.
About two hours into the patient's transfusion, he had an episode of tachycardia to 120, an increased respiratory rate up to 40, with a temperature of 100.6.
The patient was stable, and his oxygen saturation went up.
His chest x-ray showed no evidence of any flash pulmonary edema.
Congestive heart failure; echocardiogram in [**2157**] revealed an ejection fraction of 35% 4.
Anemia, baseline hematocrit is 26 to 30 7.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals:  Temperature 99.6, T-max 102.8, pulse 90, respiratory rate 22, blood pressure 98-120/60, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, mucous membranes moist.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 19.8 with a differential of 92 neutrophils, 1 band, hematocrit 28.9, platelets 246.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.2, chloride 100, bicarbonate 24, BUN 33, creatinine 1.8, glucose 176.
Calcium 9.1, magnesium 2.1, phos 1.9.
AST 14, ALT 12, alkaline phosphatase 111, total bilirubin 0.5, albumin 4.1.
PT 13.7, PTT 34.1, INR 1.3.
Amylase 75.
Urinalysis showed leukocyte esterase moderate, white blood cell count 21-50, no squamous epithelial cells.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of consolidation or congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram initially was sinus at a rate of 101, [**Street Address(2) 5366**] depressions in V4 to V6, 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in I, II, III, AVF.
A few hour later, the electrocardiogram showed a rate of 80, with [**Street Address(2) 8206**] depressions in V4 through V6, and 1-2 mm depressions in I, II, III, AVF.
However, with serial CPKs, the patient began to rule in and had a peak CPK of 1789, with an MB of 130.
The MB fraction was 7.3.
In addition, the patient had a troponin of greater than 50.
Eventually the patient was also restarted on a low dose of Captopril once his pressures were stabilized.
The patient's mean arterial pressure went as low as 50 to 60.
However, at this time he maintained his systolic blood pressure greater than 100.
Because amiodarone was begun, the patient's liver function tests were checked.
This revealed that his ALT was 829, and his AST was 273.
He was given a few boluses of 500 mg of intravenous normal saline without much change to his blood pressure.
In order to quantify the patient's new cardiac status following his myocardial infarction, an echocardiogram was obtained.
He also had 1+ aortic regurgitation, 3+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
This did not represent a significant change from his echocardiogram in [**2157**], although the degree of pulmonary artery hypertension had increased.
Blood pressure:  The patient's pressure was initially low secondary to his urosepsis.
Once he was back in normal sinus rhythm, his blood pressure also recovered back into the 100-110 range.
The patient's blood pressure was well controlled at the end of the admission on his standing dose of lasix, 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day of Lopressor, and 6.25 mg by mouth three times a day of Captopril.
Urine culture grew out proteus PCs.
Blood cultures grew only one out of four bottles of proteus species.
White blood cell count initially came down from 19.8, but then unexplainably went back up to 15.4 about five days into the admission.
The patient had a normal chest x-ray, C. difficile negative, repeat urine culture negative other than the presence of sterile pyuria, and blood cultures otherwise remained negative other than the one out of four initial proteus growth.
Renal:  The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.4 to 1.6.
However, the creatinine recovered, dropping to as low as 1.1, well below the patient's baseline.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient's increase in liver function tests was most likely secondary to the amiodarone, which was discontinued.
However, a right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained, which showed widening of the inferior vena cava, and echogenic liver changes consistent with cardiac cirrhosis or fatty changes in the liver.
Hematology:  The patient's baseline hematocrit is 26-30.
Because of his demand ischemia, there was an effort to raise his hematocrit to 30.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day  as needed  FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will need to have his INR checked every other day until it is within therapeutic range between 2.5 and 3.0.
The patient will also need to have liver function tests checked weekly for at least two weeks in order to ensure that his liver function tests are declining secondary to stopping the amiodarone.
Urosepsis 2.
Cardiac heart failure 5.
