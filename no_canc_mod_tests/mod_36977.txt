Compared to the previous tracing of [**2114-6-20**] sinus tachycardia and left atrial abnormality are new.
[**2114-7-2**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**2114-7-2**] SPINAL FLUID NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CXR [**2114-7-9**] Improved consolidation with residual consolidation in the posterior basilar segment of the right lower lobe.
[**2114-7-9**] CT HEAD There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
[**2114-7-9**] ABD ULTRASOUND 1.
CSF [**2114-7-11**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Lymphocytes, monocytes, and red blood cells.
EEG [**2114-7-10**] This is an abnormal routine EEG obtained in stage II sleep progressing to stage III sleep with brief periods of wakefulness due to the presence of sharp and spikes bifrontally, left more than right.
This can be seen in context of high blood levels of antihistamines, Albuterol.
Acyclovir and levofloxacin, as well as sedatives she was given in the ICU may have contributed to her MS given her poor renal and hepatic clearance (propofol, d/c on [**7-4**]; morphine, dosed 2mg on [**7-6**], and ?amt on [**7-4**]).
At discharge, the patient was afebrile, her renal biopsy site was resolving well, her WBC on [**7-11**] was 11.2, and she was alert, oriented to person, place and time, and appropriate.
Her sodium normalized at discharge to 137. .
Prior echo ([**7-2**]) and repeat echo ([**7-9**]) revealed no valvular abnormalities, no vegetations.
The murmur was no longer present on exam at discharge on [**7-12**].
She was extubated after her MRI but then became hypercarbic likely secondary to volume overload.
Upon transfer from the ICU, she continued to be stable on room air but was running a low grade fever and did have a chest Xray consistent with RLL aspiration pneumonia with possible LUL pneumonia.
A repeat CXR on [**7-9**] showed improvement in the RLL consolidation.
At discharge, she was afebrile and her lung exam was clear to ascultation.
The differential diagnosis considered in a patient with HIV, HepC, Cirrhosis and DM2 was broad and included hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy, HIV-associated encephalopathy (20% of HIV encephalopathy is first presentation of symptomatic disease), toxins, withdrawal (given her polysubstance abuse), malignancy (lymphoma or primary or secondary tumor) vasculitidites (mixed cryos, microscopic polyarteritis, primary CNS vasculitis), hemmorhagic stroke, or OI with HIV (including toxo, crypto, TB, listeria, PML).
Her MRI/MRA showed an increase in T2 signal in periventricular and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
The MRI showed no mass effect or bleed, ruling out tumor or hemmorhagic stroke.
An EEG during admission was consistent with no epileptiform activity.
She was found to be HSV negative on [**7-9**], ppd negative on [**7-9**], HTLV1/2 negative on [**7-12**], and crypto negative on [**7-12**].
TTE on [**7-6**] and [**7-9**] showed no vegetiations, with the remainder of the study normal.
JCV, CMV and Toxo from [**7-11**] LP were pending at the time of discharge.
6. hip/flank pain Most likely secondary to hematoma following renal biopsy, visualized on abdominal CT ([**7-6**]) as 2.7 by 4.8 cm lesion.
Leukocytosis The patient was started on Levofloxacin/Flagyl on [**7-5**] for RLL infiltrate seen on CXR and increasing WBC (see above).
Creatinine on discharge was 3.2.
Pathology from renal biopsy consistent with diabetic nephropathy and possibly IgA nephropathy.
Anemia During her last admission, the patient's anemia and iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Her hematocrit was stable over this admission and discharged at 26.5%.
Currently stable and discharged with platelet count of 68. .
Chronic renal insufficiency with Diabetic Nephropathy and IgA Nephropathy 5.
Hepatitis C 7.  cirrhosis 8.
