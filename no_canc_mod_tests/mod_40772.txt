Because the patient's blood pressures were still hypotensive, she was started on continuous venovenous hemodialysis which the patient tolerated well for the first 24 hour to 36 hours.
The patient had multiple blood cultures, and urine cultures, and sputum cultures drawn.
The urine cultures grew fungus, but other than that remained negative.
The patient had a cortisol level sent which did show suppressed adrenal function.
The patient's hematocrit then remained stable at greater than 30 over the course of her stay.
During this time, the patient's blood pressure was slightly low and was started on short-term pressors; however, this was titrated off within 12 hours, and the patient's blood pressure remained stable off pressors.
As her blood pressure was rising, the patient was switched over to ultrafiltration, to which she was tolerating well except for episodes of hypotension as long as ultrafiltration was done at a slow rate.
The patient's creatinine improved while on dialysis; however, her urine output remained low throughout the course of this stay and will likely need to continue dialysis until her renal function improves and urine output picks up.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  For the patient's respiratory failure, after her episode of unresponsiveness, the patient was restarted on ventilation through her tracheostomy site, and the patient had a blood gas which was shown to be acidotic and hypertachypneic; however, was more consistent with a metabolic source of her unresponsiveness.
The patient had a bronchoscopy during the course of this admission which showed swollen vocal cords and some small granulation tissue at the site of her tracheostomy; however, this was not very significant.
Because of poor upper airway support, the patient tolerated the tracheostomy mask well, and this can be weaned as tolerated with the goal of eventual tracheostomy removal.
If needed, if her INR drops below 2, the patient should be started on her argatroban to maintain appropriate anticoagulation.
She was continued on her aspirin, Plavix, and beta blocker which was titrated up as tolerated for better blood pressure control.
Goal blood sugar of less than 120.
