Admission Date:  [**2112-6-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-7-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-3-4**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICAL ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 66 year old female who presented with light-headedness, dizziness, hematemesis, to an outside hospital on [**2112-6-6**], and was found to have a hematocrit of 15.0 and workup was consistent with an upper gastrointestinal bleed.
On [**2112-6-7**], esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a spurting visible vessel in the distal esophagus and 9cc of Epinephrine were injected.
On [**2112-6-8**], esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed old blood in the fundus and the distal esophagus was injected a third time.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat is normocephalic and atraumatic.
PERTINENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count was 10.0, hematocrit 30.2, platelet count 230,000.
Sodium 142, potassium 3.6, chloride 108, bicarbonate 27, blood urea nitrogen 13, creatinine 0.5, glucose 114, calcium 7.9, phosphate 3.2, magnesium 1.7.
ALT 10, AST 10, alkaline phosphatase 60, total bilirubin 1.0.
Prothrombin time 13.9, INR 1.3, partial thromboplastin time 24.6.
Chest x-ray showed the endotracheal tube in proper position, patchy alveolar opacity in the right lung, opacity with air bronchograms in the left retrocardiac region, differential diagnosis multifocal aspiration, pneumonia, asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 71 beats per minute, no ST-T wave changes, normal axis, normal intervals.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed - The patient's hematocrit remained stable in the low 30.0s and high 20.0s throughout her hospital stay.
The patient did receive one unit of packed red blood cells on [**2112-6-22**], for a slowly decreasing hematocrit to 27.0 over several days.
Her hematocrit responded appropriately to this one unit of packed red blood cells and she did not require further transfusions.
No instrumentation had been performed on that side, and chest x-rays from the previous days had not shown a pneumothorax.
Right pleural fluid was serosanguinous with 400 white blood cells, 50% polys, total protein 2.9, glucose 107, LDH 515, gram stain negative.
On [**2112-6-19**], the patient's pleural fluid and the blood culture bottle was positive for gram positive cocci.
Chest x-ray on [**2112-6-20**], showed that the pneumothorax had resolved.
On [**2112-6-21**], the patient was extubated and her oxygen saturation remained in the 90s on nonrebreather face mask.
On [**2112-6-22**], chest x-ray showed increased pulmonary edema, and the patient was clinically with crackles bilaterally in the lungs two thirds of the way up.
Head CT on [**2112-6-26**], was negative for an acute process.
The patient was not yet back to her high baseline mental status, but no further workup was deemed necessary.
Echocardiogram on [**2112-6-22**], revealed a mildly dilated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, normal left ventricular wall motion, hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function, ejection fraction of greater than 75%, right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion normal.
The patient's heart rate and systolic blood pressure increased after extubation to a heart rate in the 100 to 130 range, and systolic blood pressure in the 170 to 200 range.
The Nitroglycerin and Esmolol drips effectively controlled the patient's heart rate and blood pressure but they remained labile.
Another important factor contributing to the patient's systolic blood pressure and heart rate elevation was anxiety and agitation as mentioned above.
The patient's cardiac vital signs also stabilized as her agitation decreased and her mental status improved.
Currently, her heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled on Metoprolol 100 mg three times a day.
Liver function - The patient's liver function tests were within normal limits on admission.
On [**2112-6-20**], the patient was noted to have increased ALT to 106, AST 84, LDH 306, alkaline phosphatase 158, total bilirubin 0.5, amylase 63, lipase 106.
The patient underwent ultrasound of the abdomen that day which had a normal gallbladder, normal liver, normal biliary tree and normal kidneys.
The patient's liver function tests normalized within two days and the etiology of this transient increase in liver function tests was thought to be possibly drug related.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was provided nutrition via nasogastric tube and tube feeds were as per nutrition consultation recommendations.
Prophylaxis - The patient was started on subcutaneous Heparin on [**2112-6-17**], after hematocrit continued to be stable and gastroenterology consultation agreed.
