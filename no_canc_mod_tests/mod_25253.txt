Pain was located in the occipital region without radiation.
A head CT out [**Hospital3 **] showed diffuse SAH within the basal cisterns and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for angiogram and intervention/management.

Bilateral extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, with now small amount of bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns when compared to prior study from [**2132-6-27**] at 9 a.m.
Slight interval decrease in ventricular dilatation, compared to study performed 10.5 hours earlier.
[**2132-6-30**] ECHO Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Upon admission she was intubated and taken to INR for a cerebral angiogram with coiling of the L MCA/ACOMM aneurysm.
On [**6-28**], her EVD was not draining, after multiple attempts to trouble shoot, a Head CT was done to verify placement and TPA was given with good effect.
Post-coiling, her SBP goal was > 160 but this demanded three pressors which she had maxed on so her SBP was liberalized to > 100.
Her exam remained stable.
On [**6-29**], she was extubated and her exam remained stable.
On [**6-30**], her drain was raised to 10 cm H20 - then the following day to 20 cm H20.
IVF were taped down and her blood pressure was liberalized.
On [**7-3**], her exam remained stable and her ICPs remain wnl.
A head CT was done which was stable and her EVD was discontinued.
Overnight she was febrile and blood cultures and urine was sent which was negative for UTI.
A CXR was performed because of her fever the night prior, which showed no pneumonia.
Her urine culture was negative but we opted to continue treating as her UA was positive.
