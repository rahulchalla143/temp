Daughter called EMS, and they were unable to measure blood pressure initally, measured 60/palp upon arrival to ED.
Initial ECG negative for ischemia.
A repeat ECG showed inferior ST elevation.
CT scan of head negative, CTA negative for PE/aortic dissection, CT abdomen negative for AAA.
Repeat EKG after scan with resolution of ST changes.
Trop 0.05, CK negative.
Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] , vital signs were 113/57, HR 109 ST on 5 mcg Dopamine, sats 98% on 3 liters, afebrile.
She was transferred immediately to the cath lab, initial vital signs were HR 78 BP 99/60 O2 sta 99% RA.
Physical Exam: VS -  T 100.4 HR 84 BP 98/50 RR 18 O2 sat 96% RA Gen: Elderly female in NAD.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 5 cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.

Cardiac Cath [**2136-7-27**]: Full report pending at time of discharge; showed 3 vessel disease, bare metal stent placed in the RCA, thought to be the cuprit lesion .
Echo [**2136-7-25**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %) with distal LV/apical akinesis and inferior/infero-lateral severe hypokinesis.
# Hypotension/Syncopal event: On the cardiology floor, she proceeded to have copious amounts of diarrhea with BP in the high 80s, which was initially fluid responsive.
She had a temp to 100.4 on first night of admission, Cipro/flagyl was started for presumed GI bacteremia and stool studies/blood cultures were sent.
BP susbsequently dropped to 60s/30s, which came up to low 70s with fluid boluses.
However, TTE showed depressed EF with a new inferolateral wall motion defect.
Hct remained stable and GI did not recommend scope.
TTE showed a new inferolateral akinesis, and once patient was stabilized back on the floor, decision was made to cath.
Cath showed 3-vessel disease and anatomy suitable for CABG for optimal management; however, patient previously reuqested she would not want a CABG because her husband died from complications from his bypass.
Post cath, patient's pressures were stable, and groin site was intact with no hematoma.
She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in his clinic in 2 weeks for an outpatient stress echo to look for a reversible wall defect in her anterior territories.
Syncope 2.
Your nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea was likely due to a viral gastroenteritis, which caused you to become very dehydrated.
You were admitted to the ICU because of low blood pressure, which improved with fluids and medications to increase your blood pressure called pressors.
Once your blood pressures were normal, you were taken off the pressors.
A cardiac catheterization showed blockages in all 3 of your major vessels supplying blood to the heart muscle.
