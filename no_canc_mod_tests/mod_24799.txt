REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:      N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[**2145-8-9**] Cardiac Catheterization Report: Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry of the right femoral artery, using a 5 French angled pigtail catheter, advanced to the left ventricle through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections using a 5 French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast injections.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.
A 6Fr long sheath was exchanged in for right femoral access and a [**Doctor Last Name **] 3 guide provided good support for the procedure.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow established in LAD.
Arterial time = 1 hour 49 minutes.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
Partial resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systemic arterial systolic with a SBP of 150mmHg and a normal systemic arterial diastolic pressure with a DBP of 71mmHg.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow established (see PTCA comments).
Patient had echocardiogram that showed EF of 35-40% with akinesis of the distal LV and apex with hypokinesis of the anterior wall.
He had a cardiac catheterization on [**8-9**] that showed three vessel disease with 100% occlusion of his mid LAD.
Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2145-9-24**] at [**Hospital1 **] and a cardiac MRI will be scheduled prior to that appointment.
He was given IV lasix with good urine output and improvement of his edema and crackles.
#Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient reported baseline creatinine of 2.1, with creatinine of 1.7 in admission.
After treatment with lasix, creatinine improved to 1.5.
Patient received 400cc of contrast during his catheterization and was then given 600cc of D5NS with total of 90meq of HCO3.
Patient will have BMP for evaluation of electrolytes and kidney function on Friday [**2145-8-13**] at Dr.[**Name (NI) 87306**] clinic in [**Location (un) **], MA.
Patient can be restarted on low dose ACEi after evaluation of his kidney function as an outpatient.
Thyroid function tests suggested subclinical hypothyroidism with mildly elevated TSH and normal free T4, low T3.
Patient's lisinopril was held until further evaluation of kidney function occurs.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check a PT, PTT, INR, and Chem7 on Friday [**2145-8-13**] and [**2145-8-16**], and fax results to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6382**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
You were admitted to the CCU where we diuresed you, and you had a cardiac catheterization performed on [**2145-8-9**].
You will want your INR to be between [**2-3**].
- Please STOP taking amlodipine - Please STOP taking lisinopril  It will be very important for you to follow up in the coumadin clinic to further manage your coumadin dosing.
Followup Instructions: Please go to Dr.[**Name (NI) 87306**] clinic ([**Location (un) 87307**], [**Location (un) **], [**Numeric Identifier 54380**]) for blood work on Friday [**2145-8-13**] at 10:30, and Monday [**2145-8-16**] at 10:45.
Prior to this visit you will need to get a Cardiac MRI done.
If you have not heard from her within 2-3 days please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10464**].
