PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was afebrile, blood pressure 190/106, heart rate in the 80s, respirations 16.
Her cardiac examination was regular rhythm with no murmurs.
There was no lower extremity edema and her pulses were intact bilaterally.
An EKG on presentation was normal sinus rhythm at 92, ST elevations in 2, 3 and F with elevations in 3 greater than 2.
Post cardiac catheterization she had persistent ST elevations.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.9, hematocrit 32, platelets are 214, INR 1.0.
Chem-7: sodium 140, K of 3.6, chloride 105, bicarb 24, BUN 27, creatinine 1.2.
Chest x-ray at the outside hospital revealed a calcified aorta, no evidence of congestive heart failure.
