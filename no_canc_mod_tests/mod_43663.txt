His daughter-in-law knocked on the door and found him in the bathroom looking confused.
There, vitals where felt to be normal however a head CT identified a large (4cm) left frontal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.

Blood products layer in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, as before.
CTA: This examination is somewhat limited due to motion-related artifact.
CT [**2165-5-15**]:  A left frontal intraparenchymal hematoma is redemonstrated, with a neighboring region of edema, measuring approximately 6.2 x 3.8 cm.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 79285**] was admitted to Neurology ICU stroke team for evaluation and management of IPH.
Neuro He was closely monitered in ICU for neuro checks every 1 hour.
Repeat CT scans were done for monitering of progression of bleed or for monitering for signs of edema, which did not show any evidence of either.
MRI was done for more evaluation which showed possilbe small embolic strokes however there was no clinical evidence or any embolic source identified.
Cards He was closely monitered on telemetry which did not show any evidence of arrhythmia.
He was ruled out for ACS by EKG and cardiac enzymes.
Blood pressure goal was 120-160 systolic.
Endo He was closely followed up regards to blood sugars and RISS was used for control of blood sugars.
Pulm Chest X ray was obtained which did not show any evidence of acute process.
His urine lytes were noted to have an elevated sodium and were consistent with SIADH.
He sodium should be monitored periodically and his fluid restriction should conitnue (800-1000cc fluid a day) until his sodium remains stable  Cardiac The patient had an echocardiogram which showed depressed LV function (LV=35%).
His cardaic enzymes were normal during this period, it is not clear if he has had this in the past.
You were first placed in the neuro ICU for monitoring and blood pressure control.
We obtained an MRI which did not show any evidence of underlying masses but there was a concern of small strokes.
To further evaluate this we obtained an echocardiogram of your heart which showed a depressed LV function (EF = 35%) but no evidence of thrombus.
