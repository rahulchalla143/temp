She was transfused 1 unit of blood for a HCT of 27.8, which bumped appropriately to 29.8.
BP was low initially in the ICU, with SBP in the 80s, but this responded appropriately to fluid boluses.
The patient was restarted on her beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and statin per cardiology and ECHO was performed on HD3, which showed new hypokinesis in the LAD distribution.
From a GI perspective, CT scan showed leakage of the colonic stump/abscess and she was initially started on vanc, cipro, and flagyl, and the vanc was ultimately discontinued.
Her urine output was approx 20cc/hr, but she did require intermittent 250cc boluses to keep her Uop up.
The patient was initially scheduled to go to rehab on [**2160-12-25**], but cardiology re-assessed the patient and decided that cardiac catheterization might be necessary given new changes to ECHO and the elevated troponins.
The patient was taken to the cath lab on [**2160-12-25**], however after further discussion with patient and family, cardiology felt the bump in troponins was more likely from previous hypovolemia and not acute plaque rupture, so the cath was deferred.
