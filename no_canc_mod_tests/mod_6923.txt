HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old man with history of dilated cardiomyopathy since [**2094**] which was diagnosed in [**Hospital6 1129**], at which time his catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 38% with no coronary artery disease.
Over the last several years he has been followed with echocardiogram which has revealed worsening of his congestive heart failure.
He had a sleep study which revealed obstructive sleep apnea and therefore was started on C-PAP approximately two weeks prior to admission but did not tolerate it well.
On [**9-16**] he was transferred from CCH to [**Hospital3 4527**] and had pacemaker interrogation which showed conversion from normal sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation.
Now he has been transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for transesophageal echo and plan for cardioversion biventricular pacing.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for atrial fibrillation with recent onset, cardiomyopathy diagnosed in [**2094**] with an EF of 38%.
Echocardiogram in [**2097**], [**Month (only) 404**], revealed an EF of 45% with mild aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation with diffuse hypokinesis.
In [**2100-10-6**] he had an EF of 45% with severe mitral regurgitation.
In [**2102-5-7**] ejection fraction of less than 20% with severe aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation as well as left ventricular dilatation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission he was afebrile with blood pressure of 102/48, pulse 64, respirations 18 to 20.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission were notable for hematocrit approximately 32.4, potassium approximately 3.2 and T3 of 35 with TSH of 1.3.
Dig level 1.8.
Echocardiogram done on [**9-19**] revealed an EF of 15% with marked left atrial enlargement and right atrial enlargement with patent foramen ovale, left ventricular dilatation and 2+ aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, no major changes since the echocardiogram done in [**2102-5-7**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the C-Med service and then transferred from the C-Med service to the CCU on [**9-20**] for invasive hemodynamic monitoring and optimization of his cardiovascular status.
He had a transesophageal echocardiogram and subsequent unsuccessful cardioversion, was started on Amiodarone with plan to reattempt cardioversion in [**5-12**] weeks.
Instead he was brought to the CCU for invasive hemodynamic monitoring with Milrinone therapy.
Throughout his hospital course, as far as his pump function was concerned, he was put on a Milrinone drip which was increased to 5 mcg/minute and successfully increased his cardiac output and cardiac index in the [**6-11**] and 2-3 range.
His cardiac function remained stable, however, he became dry last few days of admission with decreased po intake and continued po diuresis with Lasix and his Lasix dose was held on [**2102-9-19**] and po intake was encouraged to keep him euvolemic.
As far as his coronaries were concerned, he remained AV paced for most of his stay in CCU with his DDD pacemaker.
Pulmonary wise he had severe pulmonary edema on admission and had an oxygen requirement, however, this improved markedly with his diuresis and over the last few days of his hospital course he had no oxygen requirement whatsoever, was satting well on room air.
Renal, his BUN and creatinine decreased to 1.9 creatinine and this later increased after being transferred from the unit up to 2.7, most likely secondary to dehydration and intravascular depletion.
He continued to have poor po intake and for this reason a swallowing study was done which revealed no abnormalities in swallowing except for some poor chewing and suggestion was made for soft diet with lots of fluid supplement.
