PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.6, heart rate of 110, blood pressure 111/79, respiratory rate of 24.
HEENT examination was unremarkable.
On cardiac examination he had a rapid rate with a regular rhythm, a 1/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, and a notable S3.
His pulses revealed right dorsalis pedis was 2, posterior tibialis was 1.
Left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis were 1 and palpable.
His first laboratories at the [**Hospital1 188**] were white blood cell count of 14, hematocrit 38.7, platelets 279.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.5, chloride 97, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 1.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization and further evaluation.
At the time of cardiac catheterization he was found to have a codominant system with his left circumflex having no significant disease, his right coronary artery which was codominant with the left circumflex had mild disease with 20% proximal middle and distal lesions.
At the time of catheterization, his left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was noted to be 37, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 33.
His cardiac output was 4.3, cardiac index of 1.9, systemic vascular resistance of 1504.
A cardiac echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 35% with a mildly dilated left atrium and right atrium, and moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anteroseptal, anterior and apical akinesis and hypokinesis.
The patient responded well to mild diuresis with intravenous Lasix, as he was found to be significantly volume overloaded after cardiac catheterization.
