Patient's cardiac catheterization at that time revealed left anterior descending 60% occlusion, LM 50% occlusion, right coronary artery 90%, OM 70%, PL 60%.
The patient's ejection fraction at this time was determined to be normal with elevated end diastolic pressure.
No cardiac echo was performed at that time.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient is a well-developed, well-nourished male in no apparent distress with vitals: Temperature 99.6, pulse 78, blood pressure 121/76, respirations 18, currently saturation 94% on room air.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The patient was weaned off of Neo-Synephrine and patient's pressure continued to stabilize without pressor support.
The patient's oxygen saturation also remained excellent at this time post extubation.
Subsequently diltiazem drip was initiated with 25 mg initial bolus and patient's rate converted thereafter to sinus and maintained a rate of 78 beats per minute.
