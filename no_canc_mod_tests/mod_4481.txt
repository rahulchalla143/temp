On [**8-1**] a.m., he became acutely SOB, ABG c/w hypercarbic respiratory failure, at which time pt was intubated and started on levophed for blood pressure support.
Blood cultures from [**8-1**] grew [**3-8**] S. aureus (sensitivities pending), at which time his abx were changed to vanco/gent.

Pertinent Results: [**2145-8-2**] wbc 8.5, Hgb 85, HCT 27.9 (from 24.7), plt 113 MCV 106, RDW 17.2 Na 141, K 3.8, Cl 107, HCO3 23, BUN 24, Cr 3.2, glc 216 AG 11, MG 1.3 (repleted) lactate 1.9 (from 4.1) .
[**2145-8-1**] PT 14.9, INR 1.5, PTT 37.7 FBG 224  Brief Hospital Course: 1) S. aureus bacteremia: The patient was admitted directly to the MICU from the ED with the diagnosis of sepsis.
He required a brief period of intubation and blood pressure support, but was quickly weaned off of the ventilator.
Surveillance cultures were drawn, revealing [**12-8**] positive for s. aureus, then 0/4 and 0/4 on subsequent days.
A TTE and TEE were both performed and were negative for vegetations.
Bilateral subclavian ultrasounds were performed, revealing no abscesses, but the right side was notable for a non-occlusive thrombus in the R subclavian.
2) CAD: An initial EKG performed on admission revealed ST depressions in leads V4-V6.
Cardiac enzymes were obtained and revealed no elevations in troponins x3.
Iron studies were sent and were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Vancomycin trough levels were drawn just before his dosing at HD, with goal troughs of 15-20. .
A HIT antibody was drawn and heparin containing products were discontinued.
The HIT antibody came back negative, but because of the improvement off heparin products, it was decided to avoid heparin for the remainder of his stay.
