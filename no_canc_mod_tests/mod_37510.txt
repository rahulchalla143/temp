# Hypotension- The patient had systolic blood pressures in the 90's (while he was on Dopamine drip) which is lower than baseline on presentation to the CCU.
His baseline systolic blood pressures are usually between 95-110 as per patient.
He wa weaned off his dopamine drip and tolerated well with increase in systolic blood pressure to 100-110. .
We monitored hemodynamics overnight which remained stable.
The patient never felt short of breath in CCU and his O2 saturation  on room air was [**Last Name (un) 8585**] 96&.
#Left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass/PVD- Had poor lower extremity pulses which is consistent with baseline (1+ Left DP and 1+ Right DP) .
#Ventricular fibrillation - has [**2168**] and [**2170**] Biventricular ICD-[**Company 1543**] .
