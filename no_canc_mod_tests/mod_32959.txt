She thus underwent an ERCP on [**2179-3-8**] for further evaluation.
The ERCP showed a dilated common bile duct, ductal ectasia and evidence of mild chronic pancreatitis.
A CT scan revealed non-enhancement of the body and tail of the pancreas, consistent with necrosis.
She was treated with antibiotics, aggressive IVF, and a dilaudid PCA, but developed an O2 requirement, mild ARF, and a significant leukocytosis, though she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
[**3-9**] MRI abd OSH: [**3-14**] CT Abd/Pelvis: B/L pleural effusions,  Necrotizing pancreatitis involving greater than 50% of the pancreas.
[**3-24**] RUE U/S no DVT [**3-25**] CT abd/pelvis: Persistent findings of severe necrotizing pancreatitis, with normal enhancement seen involving only a portion of the pancreatic head and tail, and interval development of peripheral enhancement of a large pancreatic bed fluid collection, which may represent abscess.
I am summarizing the entirety of her hospital course but she was directly under my care only from [**3-22**] - [**3-30**]***  [**3-10**] The hepato-biliary team was consulted by MICU team for help with management of severe necrotizing pancreatitis; the patient had been admitted from an OSH tfollowing ERCP with development of severe abdominal pain and shock.
CT and MRI at the OSH revealed a nonenhancing body/tail of pancreas consistent with > 50% necrosis, significant inflammation of pancreas, no intrahepatbiliary ductal dilatation, and a small spleen.
She underwent extensive fluid resucsitation with normal saline, and subsequently the patient developed hyperchloremic hypernatremic metabolic acidosis that resolved as below.
The patient was also started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin/meropenem), an NGT was placed, as well as CVL and A line.
Diuresis was initiated as her blood pressure stabilized and her fluid requirements decreased.
[**3-14**] She eventually did get the CT scan, which revealed B/L pleural effusions,  necrotizing pancreatitis involving greater than 50% of the pancreas.
She was started on nebulizers for persistent wheezing and underwent a CXR that revealed a small effusion on the right.
She underwent a surveillance CT scan of her abd/pelvis that revealed persistent findings of severe necrotizing pancreatitis, with normal enhancement seen involving only a portion of the pancreatic head and tail, and interval development of peripheral enhancement of a large pancreatic bed fluid collection.
[**3-24**] She also underwent a RUE U/S for the ?
She does remain with a significant leukocytosis, however, this is consistent with prior levels, and I do not suspect this to be consistent with  Medications on Admission: [**Last Name (un) 1724**]: ativan 0.5', Ca, cymbalta 30', FeSO4, prilosec 20', zocor 80', singulair 10', [**Last Name (LF) 82671**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 81', avapro 150', florinef 0.05', toprol 50'  Discharge Medications: 1.
