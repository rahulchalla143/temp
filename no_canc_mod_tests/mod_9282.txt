He also noted that he had woken up with mild neck pain and proximal arm numbness accompanied by mild SOB, palpitations and pleuritic chest pressure all of which he associated with anxiety.
On arrival to the [**Location (un) 47**] ED he was noted to be tachycardic with HR in 180s and he was found to be in wide complex tachycardia on EKG which was initially thought to be an SVT and he received several doses of adenosine which he was sensitive to, but didn't break, going into sinus, then bigeminy then back into VT.
Of note, he underwent cardiac catheterization within the past year for exertional chest discomfort and a reportedly abnormal stress test.
