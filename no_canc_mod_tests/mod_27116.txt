TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial CT imaging of the cervical spine with sagittal and coronal reformations was reviewed.
FINDINGS: The study is markedly limited secondary to patient motion.
Evaluation of the soft tissues of the spinal canal is limited by CT, but there is no evidence for acute cord disruption.
The possibility of other fracture is not identified given patient motion, repeat imaging is recommended.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: PED STRUCK BY CAR.R/O BLEED  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 40 year old man ped vs. car, high speed, ?
INDICATION: Previous CT cervical spine limited by motion.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images with IV contrast from the aortic arch to the vertex of the skull, with multiplanar reformats.
Comparison with CT cervical spine, [**2183-11-14**] at 21:58.
CT CERVICAL SPINE: Right occipital condyle fracture, minimally displaced.
CT ANGIO NECK: Both common carotid arteries are normal in appearance, without significant atherosclerotic narrowing or evidence of dissection.
MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST  Reason: r/o cord injury  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 40 year old man with cervical spine fractures REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o cord injury MRI CERVICAL SPINE  CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with cervical spine fracture, rule out cord injury.
TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal, gradient echo sagittal and T2 axial images of the cervical spine were acquired.
Correlation was made with the cervical spine CT of [**2183-11-14**].
A 1.5-cm cystic area is identified projected over the upper thoracic posterior subcutaneous region which could be due to an incidental sebaceous cyst.
Mild anterolisthesis of C6 over C7 is seen.
MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  Reason: fracture evaluation  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 40 year old man with cervical spine fractures REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: fracture evaluation MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with fracture of L2 for further evaluation.
TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T1 and T2 axial images of the lumbar spine were obtained.
Correlation was made with the abdominal CT of [**2183-11-14**].
FINDINGS: As seen on the abdominal CT of [**2183-11-14**], there is fracture of the L2 vertebral body identified.
IMPRESSION: Fracture of L2 vertebra with disruption of ligamentous structures at L2-3 level as described above.
The fracture extends through the posterior elements as seen on the CT of [**2183-11-14**].
ECG: [**2183-11-17**] Sinus tachycardia Early precordial QRS transition - is nonspecific Diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2183-11-16**], sinus tachycardia rate faster and further ST-T wave changes present   Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 116 102 90 302/371 74 47 130     Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to the Trauma service.
He was taken to the operating room on [**11-16**] for repair of his lumbar spine injuries; his cervical spine injuries were nonoperative; he will need to remain in a hard collar for 4 more weeks.
