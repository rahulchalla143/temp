Of note, he has a history of significant multiple urinary tract infections, cellulitis, hypertension, and morbid obesity, and a ventral hernia that was repaired in [**2124**].
His creatinine was slightly elevated at this point but came back to his baseline prior to discharge.
His temperature was 98.7, heart rate was 112, and blood pressure was 118/70.
Head and neck examination was unremarkable.
Neurologic examination was grossly intact.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  His white blood cell count was 10.3 and hematocrit was 39.7.
His creatinine was up to 2.9.
Liver function tests, amylase, and lipase were normal.
He maintained good urine output overnight and stayed afebrile.
Our initial concern was one of pulmonary embolism, but we were unable to obtain a computed tomography scan due to his size.
His urine output had petered down to almost nothing, and he was started on continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
A postmortem examination will be obtained.
