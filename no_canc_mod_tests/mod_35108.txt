WBC was reported 22,000.
She received a dose of flagyl and subsequently signed out AMA because she did not want to drink contrast for a CT scan.
At that time, she underwent a CT scan with oral contrast only, as they were unable to obtain IV access.
Blood pressure was documented as 60/p, and a Surgical consult was obtained for central venous access.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, BP 76/42, HR 103, T 98.
Radiology reviewed CT abdomen from OSH, and a Surgical consult was obtained.

[**3-23**] CT Abdomen/pelvis: 1.
[**3-26**] CXR: PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-22**]:  Small region of heterogeneous parenchymal abnormality in the right lower lobe medial basal segment looks more like scarring than pneumonia but could be pneumonia.
[**3-27**] CT chest: 1.
Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities and centrilobular nodules with tree-in-[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 81343**] suggest acute infection .
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
EEG [**4-7**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**4-5**] SCAN FINDINGS: There are focal areas of FLAIR signal hyperintensities within the bilateral frontal subcortical white matter.
However, the study is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
[**4-5**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The presence of extensive collateral veins in the chest, seen in the prior study, significantly limits the diagnostic value for pulmonary embolus.
The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Following 180-second delay, pelvic venous opacification is adequate, and there is no evidence of thrombosis.
Osseous structures demonstrate sclerotic skeletal changes and vertebral endplate changes which may relate to end- stage renal disease.
Suboptimal study for PE given extensive collaterals, but no evidence of large/central PE.
[**4-3**] CT Head NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute large vascular territory infarction.
Additionally, patient had a sleep study and was started on BiPap, as she was found to be hypercarbic likely secondary to obesity hypoventilation.
Her oxygen requirements were increasing between [**3-/2125**] and [**4-3**] and was found to have a LLL pneumonia.
Patient had CT head, MRI head, LP, and EEG that did not allude to why patient's mental status was worsened.
Baseline sats 80-90s, and pt requires 2L NC.
Due to an A-a gradient on her blood gas, she was started empirically on a heparin gtt given previous history of SVC clot.
CTA chest was performed and was negative for PE.
[**Hospital 25730**] Hospital Acquired Pneumonia:  Patient had elevated WBC count and increasing oxygen requirement that was diagnosed by CXR on [**2147-4-3**].
CT head showed hypodensities which were poorly chracterized.
Of note, patient had received 2 mg of IV haldol for CT scan performed earlier that day.
Neurology was consulted and continous EEG monitoring was reinitiated.
EEG again showed wave forms consistent with encephalopathy, but no seizure activity.
After multiple failed bedside attempts, LP was performed under flouro; glucose 74, protein 37, 3 WBC's, 0 WBC's, negative gram stain.
MRI brain was performed and revealed Bilateral frontal subcortical FLAIR hyperintensities likely due to chronic sub-cortical infarctions and mild cerebeallar atrophy.
Patient had a CT scan on admission that showed colitis and was treated with five day course of cipro and flagyl.
CT scan from [**8-9**] showed similar findings.
# Hypotension: Patient was asymptomatic on admission with SBP in 60s.
# SVC clot: Radiographic imaging  and physical exam suggestive of extensive collaterals.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] - Colonial Heights - [**Hospital1 487**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Altered Mental Status, unclear etiology - Anxiety/Depression - Hospital Acquired Pneumonia - Infectious Colitis - Obstructive Sleep Apnea Secondary: CVID ESRD Asthma   Discharge Condition: The patient was discharged hemodynamically stable, afebrile.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of your abdominal pain with nausea.
It is unclear why your mental status was altered, but it is suspected that it is related to your psychiatric medications along with a component of delirum from pneumonia.
