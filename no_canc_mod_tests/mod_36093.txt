ACS/General Surgery was consulted and CT abdomen/pelvis was performed.
As the imaging was negative, there were no acute surgical concerns; ACS recommended tagged RBC if he continued to bleed.
GI was also consulted and recommended two units pRBC for Hct 22, IV PPI initiation.
The patient also underwent PEG lavage which was clear but was passing small amounts of maroon colored stools.
There was also initial concern for DIC but labs not suggestive of this (the patient has history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia but platelets normal).
