They went to BIDN where he had an RUQ ultrasound which showed pericholecystic fluid that was concerning for GB carcinoma.
Lowest blood pressure there was 90.
He was given a nicotine patch and 5mg Zyprexa for agitation  AT [**Hospital1 18**], he was noted to have [**Last Name (un) **] which was thought to be hypovolemic and creatinine improved with intravenous fluids.
In the Cath Lab, he underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage of blood fluid and decrease of pressure from 18 mmHg to negative.
TTE pre-pericardiocentesis showed wire/catheter in anterior pericardial space but EKG showed few ventricular pacing capture beats.
Post-pericardiocentesis TTE showed no residual pericardial effusion.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
Tissue synchronization imaging demonstrates significant left ventricular dyssynchrony with the lateral wall contracting significantly later than the septum.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-4-26**], the LVEF has decreased and the pericardial effusion is new.
RUQ US ([**2203-5-9**]) Markedly thickened gallbladder wall and thickened septum through the apparent center of the gallbladder with areas of internal vascularity, highly concerning for gallbladder malignancy.
Again, if there is concern for acute cholecystitis, a HIDA scan can be considered.
Pericardial Fluid cytology ([**2203-5-11**]) showed ...  Pericardiocentesis ([**2203-5-11**]) 1.
Injection of contrast into the  pericardial space showed the effusion to be freely flowing and non-loculated.
Initial mean pressure of the pericardium upon entrance was 17 mmHg which went down to a mean of 2 mmHg after drainage of pericardial fluid.
CT Abdomen ([**2203-5-12**]) 1.
CTA coronaries ([**2203-5-12**]) Evaluation of the pacemaker leads demonstrate that the right pacemaker lead is minimally perforating the right atrial anterior wall, 6A:102, with its most distal tip being within the pericardial space.
TTE ([**2203-5-14**]) Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-5-12**], the pericardial effusion is similar.
CXR ([**2203-5-14**]) Permanent pacemaker is present with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.

He was taken to cath lab for pericardiocentesis which revealed pericardial pressure of 18 mm Hg concerning for pericardial effusion due to pacemaker lead perforation.
150 cc of bloody drainage was removed which dropped the pericardial pressures from 18 mm Hg to 0 mm Hg.
Pericardial fluid stain and culture were negative.
Cytology was still pending at the time of discharge.
CTA coronaries showed right atrial pacemaker lead perforation so he underwent right atrial lead revision on [**2203-5-13**].
He had only 50 cc of pericardial fluid drainage over next day with repeat TTE showing no change in residual pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology.
CXR showed appropriate location of right atrial and right ventricular pacemaker leads.
He should have a repeat echocardiogram in [**1-28**] weeks to confirm that effusion is not reaccumulating.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed 3 cm CBD stones.
Surgery evaluated the patient and thought that further outpatient evaluation was appropriate as the patient did not have an obstructive pattern in LFT elevation.
With negative alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin unlikely to be obstructive.
RUQ and CT abdomen showed no liver patholgoy.
They were trending down with ALT of 132 and AST of 33 on discharge.
INR trended down to 1.4 on [**2203-5-14**].
His INR was 1.4 on discharge.
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure with EF of 35% (TTE [**4-/2203**]) and severe aortic stenosis.
Weight on discharge is 81 kg.
Peripheral vascular Disease: Discontinued home Cilostazol since it could affect systolic heart function and likely has no benefit for the patient's peripheral vascular disease.
Discharge Instructions: You had some dizziness and abdominal pain and was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after an ultrasound showed some fluid around your gallbladder.
An echocardiogram of your heart showed that there was some fluid there as well and a drain was placed to drain the fluid and keep it from reaccumulating.
You will need to have an echocardiogram in [**1-28**] weeks to check to see if the fluid around the heart has returned.
