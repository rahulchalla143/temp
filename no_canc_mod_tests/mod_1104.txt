The patient was intubated in the field and was found to be bradycardic with a heart rate in the 30s and 40s.
Hepatitis C. 2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs, 101.6 F.; blood pressure 130/80; heart rate 80 and paced; respiratory rate 20; 94% on room air.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  Values initially showed a white blood cell count of 9.7, hematocrit of 33.2, magnesium 1.8, ALT 37, AST 41, alkaline phosphatase 296, total bilirubin 1.0.
Blood cultures were growing initially Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus; urine cultures showed coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
The patient was treated initially for Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, however, subsequent blood cultures showed that the patient was growing Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient had to have his transvenous pacer wire removed.
The patient had an echocardiogram on the [**6-21**] which showed left ventricular wall thickness was normal.
Left ventricular systolic function was minimally depressed.
Right ventricular wall thickness was normal.
Right ventricular systolic function appeared to be depressed and there was abnormal diastolic septal motion position consistent with right ventricular volume overload; abnormal septal wall motion.
The patient is to have repeat permanent pacemaker placed by the Electrophysiology Service once the course of antibiotics has continued and has finished and subsequent surveillance blood cultures have been negative by the Electrophysiology Service at [**Hospital1 69**].
With the history of complete heart block, the patient had a transvenous pacer in place at a heart rate to be left at a heart rate of 80.
He had a clean catheterization at [**Hospital6 **] last year.
After the pacer wire was removed, the patient had surveillance blood cultures done which were no longer positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Vancomycin level needs to be checked and dosed accordingly.
In order to look for sources of infection initially, a CT scan of the abdomen was done which was negative.
The patient had negative blood cultures after the new pacer wire was placed.
The patient also had a neck ultrasound done which was negative for any sort of pus pockets.
Throughout the hospital course, the patient developed mild myelosuppression while on the Vancomycin, however, prior to discharge, the patient's white blood cell count had gone up to about 3 or 4 which was felt to be normal for him and the patient's white blood cell count was stable while on the Vancomycin.
The patient also had some issues with his creatinine being slightly elevated during the hospital course to a maximum of 1.4, however, this was felt to be prerenal and the patient was encouraged to take good p.o.
Urine eosinophils were negative.
Initially, when they were looking for a source of infection, the patient had a tagged white blood cell scan to find out what exactly was the source.
Surveillance blood cultures need to be done after the Vancomycin course is completed.
Check white blood cell count as well as Vancomycin levels as well as BUN and creatinine while the patient is in rehabilitation to make sure the patient is not having any more myelosuppression or renal toxicity from the Vancomycin or is not getting prerenal.
Vancomycin levels also needs to be checked as the Vancomycin dose may need to be adjusted.
