Urine culture [**2191-5-9**]: NO GROWTH.
Blood cultures [**2191-5-9**]: no growth.
EKG [**2191-5-9**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-2-5**] atrial fibrillation is now recorded.
CXR (portable AP) [**2191-5-10**]: Findings compatible with mild congestive heart failure.
CXR (portable AP) [**2191-5-10**]: There is mild increase of mild pulmonary edema.
TTE [**2191-5-10**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-2-5**], the findings are similar.
There was also concern for possible pneumonia on initial CXR, but the patient remained afebrile, and follow-up CXR showed no infiltrate.
At the time of discharge, the patient was able to maintain good oxygenation saturations with ambulation on room air.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
TTE showed preserved systolic function, and was unchanged from prior study.
#Hypertension: The patient was noted to have BP of 200/100 by EMS.
The patient's blood pressure rapidly improved.
#Eosinophilia: Patient with 7.8% eosinophils out of WBC 8.2.
#Chronic kidney disease, stage II: Creatinine was 1.3 on admission, which is the patient's baseline.
