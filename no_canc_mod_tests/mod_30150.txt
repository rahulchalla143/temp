HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old man who has a prior history of cardiac catheterization on [**2114-2-2**] after having inferior ischemia on routine screening x-rays and exercise tolerance test.
An angiography at that time revealed a 40-50% distal left main, and no other significant coronary artery disease.
He had a routine exercise tolerance test with Myoview on [**2115-2-25**].
Ejection fraction was 58% with mild septal wall hypokinesis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient's blood pressure is 130/80, heart rate 70.
EXTREMITIES:  Pedal pulses were 1+ bilaterally.
The patient underwent catheterization on [**2115-3-20**] which showed 60-70% stenosis of the left main, advanced stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and an ejection fraction of 60%.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's laboratory studies on admission included a white count of 6.4, hematocrit 40, platelet count 188, INR 1.0, partial thromboplastin time 29.3, sodium 137, potassium 4.2, chloride 102, bicarbonate 29, BUN 13, creatinine 0.8, glucose 107.
Electrocardiogram on admission was significant for normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 95; normal axis; no evidence of current acute ischemia.
