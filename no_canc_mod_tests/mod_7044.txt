The patient's liver function tests were noted to trend downward steadily.
Optimal Cyclosporin dosing was still to be determined on the day of discharge, but it was expected with continue to monitoring Cyclosporin levels following discharge.
This was confirmed by a calorie count and the decision was made to initiate cycled tube feedings on postoperative day number eight with Mepro.
A calorie count on the day prior to the patient's discharge revealed the patient was only meeting 6% of her protein needs by mouth and only 22% of her caloric needs.
Renal:  As mentioned above the patient's acute renal failure resolved steadily with serum creatinine falling from a peak of 3.6 on postoperative day number three to a baseline of about 1 by postoperative day number fifteen.
The patient required transfusions for decreases in hematocrit on postop day number fourteen and seventeen.
The patient's hematocrit will need to be monitored following discharge.
Endocrine:  The patient's blood glucose levels were controlled with insulin on a sliding scale.
The cause for the increase in TSH was unclear, but thyroid function tests were drawn on the day prior to admission and follow up is expected from the [**Hospital **] Clinic.
Fluid and electrolytes:  The patient was noted to be hypokalemic with serum potassium in the 5 to 7 range from postoperative day number eight through fifteen, requiring use of Kayexalate twice during that period, and administration of Lasix with the duel purpose of treating hyperkalemia and assisting in diuresis of the patient.
The patient's potassium was down to within normal limits by the day of discharge.
The patient was also started on 800 mg of magnesium by mouth twice a day when her magnesium levels were noted to be trending downward.
Her magnesium levels will need to be monitored following discharge.
Neuro/psychiatric evaluation was requested prior to the patient's discharge.
Findings from evaluation included the fact that the patient had deficits in memory, visual planning and organization as well as flexibility of attention and naming and as such is prone to confusion.
FOLLOW UP LABORATORY REQUIREMENTS:  The patient will need to have blood drawn for the following tests every Monday and Thursday, a CBC, chem 7, albumin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, cyclosporin.
The results of these tests should be faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at fax number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 697**].
The patient's blood glucose will need to be checked four times a day with coverage of sliding scale insulin.
