At that time, echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 percent with anterior hypokinesis.
CK checked at that time was 3000, MB was 60, troponin was 2.6.
An emergent catheterization showed patent grafts, however, severe congestive heart failure with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34.
Cardiac output improved on dopamine although the patient developed ATN and shock liver with AST in the 10,000 range.
Urine output improved on vasopressin.
The numbers on [**1-18**] were more consistent with sepsis with a cardiac output of 5.0 and an SVR of 704.
On [**1-19**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 170s with shocks times two and loaded on digoxin.
LABORATORY DATA:  Cardiac catheterization at the outside hospital on [**1-13**] showed right atrial pressure of 16, left ventricular end diastolic of 21; pulmonary artery pressures 51/33; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 34.
CK was elevated 3000 and MB of 60;    the MB index was around 5 percent.
PUMP:  Repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction    of 20 percent with global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Heart rate elevated    to the 170s on [**1-18**].
On [**1-19**], systolic blood pressure was    in the 70s, heart rate was in the 170s.
The    patient needed anti-arrhythmic loading but limited by    hepatic toxicity and blood pressures, so therefore the    patient was started on digoxin.
HYPOTENSION:  Initially presumed to be cardiogenic, but    hemodynamics later were more consistent with sepsis and    blood pressure and cardiac output improved with fluid    boluses.
Random cortisol was 6 and improved to 22 on    corticotropin stim test.
Blood pressure stabilized and the patient    was able to be started on low dose ACE inhibitor and beta    blocker.
A chest x-ray was without infiltrate.
Urinalysis remained    negative.
Blood cultures were negative to date.
Surveillance blood and fungal cultures were    negative.
The patient was treated with a two    week course of Ceftaz  (Cultured E. Coli was found to be    fluoroquinolone resistant) with the improvement in white    blood cell count and downward trend in fever curve.
As perfusion formed, liver function tests    normalized and bowel function returned.
EGD showed a 1 to 2 centimeter mass in the    esophagus and mild gastritis in the stomach body.
Colonoscopy showed non-bleeding rectal ulcer thought to be    the cause of the guaiac positive stools.
Hematocrit at    the time of discharge was stable.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient's    electrolytes were monitored and ultimately she was started    on tube feeds.
