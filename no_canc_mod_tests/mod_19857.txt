Admission Date:  [**2138-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-12-1**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Lisinopril / Tetracycline / Proton Pump Inhibitors (Benzimidazole)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**] Chief Complaint: Gram Negative Rod Sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left IJ line, ART line  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84yo man with h/o DM, HTN, pacemaker, GERD and esophagitis who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital today after having rigors and with back pain after a fall last week.
He was found to be febrile to 101, tachy to HR 120s, with ?
of irregular heart beat, with BP initially 100/70s -->80s/60s, and WBC 1.0.
He was diagnosed with sepsis of unclear source and was treated with 2 L NS, a LIJ was placed, Neo was started for hypotension, and he was given Ceftazidime, Vancomycin, Metronidazole for broad coverage given fear of neutropenia.
Cardiac Enzymes were drawn and were negative.
EKG was unremarkable.
On arrival here his temp was 99.0 degrees, CVP 18.
He was switched to levophed for blood pressure control with systolics ranging in the 90s-100s.
EKG showed a new Q in II as well as biphasic T waves and a troponin of 0.27.
The patient was discussed with cardiology who found this unlikely to be primary ACS and recommended serial cardiac enzymes, but not want to start a heparin drip.
He received a total of 3L of fluid to maintain his blood pressures, was later weaned from pressors and transferred to the general medicine floor for further management.

If there is continued clinical concern for acute cholecystitis, further evaluation with a HIDA scan is recommended.
[**2138-11-21**]: HIDA: Partial gallbladder filling, which is not consistent with acute cholecystitis.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
Since the previous tracing of [**2138-11-21**] ventriciular rate is slower, intermitent ventricular paced beats are present and further T wave abnormalities are seen.
# Gram negative rod septicemia: Patient initially presented with leukocytosis and bandemia and later was found to have e. coli bacteremia in [**4-8**] blood cultures from the OSH.
Initial ultrasound and LFTs seemed consistent with a biliary tree infection, though HIDA scan showed no signs of cholecystitis.
His sensitivities from OSH were obtained and grew E. Coli pan-sensitive.
He spiked a temperature to 103 the first night on the floor and changed briefly back to meropenem.
He responded to 250cc bolus and his cardiac enzymes and EKG were normal.
He was evaluated by cards who recognized that the LBBB was a paced rhythm and that his labs were not consistent with ACS.
We cycled his enzymes again while on the floor (after episode of hypotension) and they remained low.
- Echo was done to evaluate cardiac function and showed depressed cardiac function, but no signs of wall motion abnormality.
Pt also received fluids during his hospitalization to support his blood pressures.
In time the pt will will mobilize this fluid and he was actively diuresed prior to discharge and his potassium was repleted.
However, smear was negative for schistocytes.
Additionally a HIT antibody was checked and negative.
