His symptoms improved, and he was discharged on increased dose of diuretics.
His blood pressure at home has been mostly 110s but sometimes as low as 90.
CXR showed a well-expanded lung and a small pneumothorax that was thought to be clinically insignificant.
She took his blood pressure and it was >100.
CXR was concerning for pneumonia.
SBP 100 lying, 80 sitting.
EKG was similar to prior.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2157-10-28**] no diagnostic interim change.
EKG [**2157-11-12**] 4:45PM Underlying rhythm is probably sinus, although baseline artifact makes this difficult to determine.
CXR [**2157-11-12**] IMPRESSION: 1.
# Hypotension: Was likely related to large volume thoracentesis on [**11-11**], hypovolemia from being NPO and poor PO intake since last discharge, strict 6 cup fluid restriction, and recent change and titration up of diuretics and antihypertensive regimen.
He would clearly benefit from Spironolactone and Valsartan but his BP does not tolerate these medications.
# Chronic systolic CHF: last EF 30% on [**9-/2157**] TTE, NYHA class III.
Last cath [**10/2157**] with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**].
# Anemia: Hct remained near 30, similar to baseline.
After changing the doses of your blood pressure and heart failure medications, your blood pressure has improved.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
