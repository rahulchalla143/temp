Echocardiogram [**2164-4-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2164-4-9**] demonstrated: 1.
Arterial conduit angiography revealed a small but patent LIMA that filled the LAD.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
The pulmonary capilary wedge pressure was elevated at 30mmHg.
Left ventricular end diastolic  pressure was 33 mmHg.
Central aortic pressure was 90/60 mmHg with a mean of 77 mmHg.
There was a mean gradient of 28 mmHg across the aortic valve.
Cardiac output was 3.53 l/min/m2.
CARDIAC CATH w AORTIC VALVULOPLASTY [**2164-4-10**]: Initial hemodynamics revealed a peak aortic gradient of 19mmHg, with a valve area of 0.62cm2 and cardiac index of 1.7l/min/m2.
After several inflations with a 20mm balloon, the gradient decreased to 13mmHg and the valve area increased to 0.8cm2.
The cardiac index was relatively unchanged at 1.8l/min/m2.
- continue to diurese as tol by bp - monitor renal function - renally dose meds .
# Ischemia: documented CAD and NSTEMI in setting of demand ischemia and worsening systolic function (EF 15-20%).
- cath revealed coronaries unchanged from prior cath - ASA - currently on pressers, so no BB - statin .
