Admission Date:  [**2105-5-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-5-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac cath  History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of NSTEMI in [**2101**] (no cath or stents), moderate AS (AoVA 0.8-1.19cm2 on TTE in [**2101**]), HTN, COPD/emphysema transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for cardiac catheterization after having been worked up for CP x2 days and found to have an NSTEMI.
At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], her VS were stable in the ED (T 99.9, HR 89, BP 159/76, RR 18, 96% on RA).
The initial EKG showed PR prolongation, LAD, TWI in I, aVL, later also with TWI in V1 to V6 which persisted throughout the hospital stay.
She was found to have an NSTEMI with peak troponin of 0.94.
CXR was without any acute findings at the time of admission.
She was eventually kept on Nitro and Heparin drip until she was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] for cardiac catheterization in the morning.
Cardiac Risk Factors: -Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, +Hypertension .
Family History: Her son had an MI at age 28 (?, per patient), her brother died at age 55 of a "heart condition", which was likely an MI as well per the patient.
Physical Exam: VS: T 100.0, BP 122/75, HR 91, RR 24, O2 97% on 2L NC Gen: Younger than age appropriate appearing [**Age over 90 **] year old female in NAD.
Very dry MM and old, dried blood on hard palate Neck: Supple with JVP of approximately 7 cm.
Pulses: Right: DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]: Hb 15, WBC 7.5, Cr 1.0, BUN 24.
CK: [**Telephone/Fax (3) 73189**] Troponin: 0.52 - 0.94 - 0.77 CK-MB: 69 - 50 - 27 Index: 25.7 - 21.6 - 17.5 .
Initial EKG at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] demonstrated prolonged PR interval (236), LAD, TWI in I, aVL, later also with TWI in V1 to V6 which persisted throughout the hospital stay.
EKG at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] showed also a PR prolongation of about 240, similar TWIs in anterolateral leads and one ST elevation in V2 (less than 1 mm).
CXR: [**2105-5-1**] at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Admission CXR at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] also without any acute findings (prelim read).
The LAD had a complex calfified, ulcerated 90% stenosis in the mid-vessel after the D1 branch, which had 50% ostial and 70% mid  stenoses.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an opening aortic pressure of 133/68mmHg.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation.
TTE [**2105-5-5**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20 mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Labs on discharge: Cr 1.5 WBC 20.4 Hct 40.7 Plt 255 .
Blood cx [**5-7**]: 4/4 bottles positive MRSA Blood cx [**5-9**]: 1/4 bottles postive for GPC, awaiting speciation Blood cx [**5-11**]: NGTD Urine cx [**5-7**]: Negative   Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of NSTEMI in [**2101**] (no cath or stents), moderate AS (AoVA 0.8-1.19cm2 on TTE in [**2101**]), HTN, COPD/emphysema transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for cardiac catheterization after having been worked up for CP x2 days and found to have an NSTEMI.
A repeat TTE prior cath showed worsening of her AS from moderate to severe (AoVA 0.4cm2).
Pt underwent cath which showed two vessel disease.
Initial EKG at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] demonstrated prolonged PR interval, LAD, TWI in I, aVL, later also with TWI in V1 to V6 which persisted throughout the hospital stay.
EKG at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] showed also a PR prolongation of about 240, similar TWIs in anterolateral leads and one ST elevation in V2 but less than 1 mm.
A repeat TTE prior to cath showed worsening of her AS from moderate to severe (AoVA 0.4cm2).
Pt underwent cath which showed two vessel disease.
WBC was up to 29.
Lactate was 1.8, then 2.1.
Blood cultures came back positive for MRSA.
Her CBC should be monitored weekly given the risk of pancytopenia.
#) Rhythm: PR prolongation at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and here (also on an EKG from [**2101**]).
#) Pump: TTE with EF of 25% and progression of AS from moderate to severe.
Systolic murmur on exam consistant with AS.
#) HTN: BP of 122/75 on admission.
ARF on [**5-6**] with Cr 2.0 (baseline 1.0), likely prerenal given urinary Na less than 10 and high urine osms.
Her Cr trended down to 1.5 on the day of discharge and she maintained good urine output.
PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
