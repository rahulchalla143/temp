The patient's EKG showed ST changes with ST depression in I and AVL, a CK at the outside hospital of 1000, MB of 89 with troponin of 24.8.
The patient was transferred for cardiac catheterization which showed a RA pressure of 9, PA pressure of 34/18, with a mean of 25 and a wedge pressure of 15.
Catheterization was technically difficulty.
The catheterization was greatly unchanged from a cardiac catheterization in [**2190**] which showed left main disease with focal area of 80% in left anterior descending, left circumflex 80% occluded, right coronary artery with diffuse disease.
Heart rate 95 to 100; right arm blood pressure 80, left arm blood pressure 120; 99% on two liters nasal cannula.
Generally, comfortable, obese, lying in bed, slightly Cushingoid in appearance.
Lungs clear to auscultation laterally and occasional expiratory rhonchi anteriorly.
LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 9.0.
Hematocrit 26.7, platelets 166, INR 1.7, PT 15.7, PTT 37.2.
Sodium 142, potassium 3.8, chloride 108, bicarbonate 22, BUN 42, creatinine 2.0, glucose 148, magnesium 1.5, calcium 7.8.
CK 2187, MB fraction was 223, MB index 10.2.
EKG on [**3-4**], showed sinus tachycardia, PR interval of 154 with QRS interval of 110 milliseconds, ST depressions in I and AVL, V5 through V6.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  66 year old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus with vascular complications including coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency and renal artery stenosis, status post catheterization with extensive coronary artery disease.
Check urine protein and creatinine.
Continue blood sugar checks four times a day.
Watch creatinine closely post catheterization.
Check on her studies, reticulocyte count, goal hematocrit is greater than 30.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  Continue with diabetic diet.
The patient had complication status post cardiac catheterization which turned out to be an extra-peritoneal bleed with a pseudo-aneurysm.
The patient received blood transfusion for a hematocrit as low as 27.8.
The patient's Plavix, heparin were both held in light of the retroperitoneal bleed and have not been restarted.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis in [**3-8**], made no mention of gallbladder issues but did mention that gallbladder was distended with sludge but no edema or pericholecystic fluid around the gallbladder.
Since that time, the patient did subsequently develop severe abdominal pain and was sent for an abdominal ultrasound which showed a grossly distended gallbladder with stones, edematous gallbladder wall and some pericholecystic free fluid with no biliary dilatation.
Subsequent cultures showed Klebsiella sensitive to Levofloxacin.
The patient has been afebrile with no real issues with her white blood cell count which is now slightly elevated.
The patient did have blood cultures drawn for a temperature spike which, on [**2196-3-8**], was shown to have Staphylococcus coagulase negative in one bottle; subsequently no growth to date on other cultures.
The patient's echocardiogram on [**3-6**], showed overall left ventricular systolic function severely depressed, global hypokinesis to akinesis in the inferior posterior wall, right ventricular systolic function was good, two plus mitral regurgitation.
Due to the patient's retroperitoneal bleed, the patient's Plavix and heparin has not been restarted.
The patient's INR is elevated at 1.9, therefore, Vitamin K 5 mg subcutaneously was given.
INR will be rechecked before subclavian line is pulled.
The patient will be continued on her Procrit and her creatinine has been trending down.
The patient will need Levaquin and Flagyl for a Klebsiella, Gram negative in her bile which is sensitive to Levaquin and will be continued to be deemed the course via Infectious Disease input.
The patient's blood sugars have been stable.
Coronary artery disease status post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and status post cardiac catheterization with no intervention.
