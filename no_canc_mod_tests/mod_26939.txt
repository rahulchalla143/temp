In the ED the patient was found to be febrile to 101 with systolic bp's in the 60's, heart rate ranging from 120's up to 140's.
She was given 4 liters of IVF with improvement of her blood pressure to systolic 100-110's, however her heart rate decreased to only 120's.
A UA was suggestive of infection with >50 WBCs, many bacteria.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn and the pt was given a dose of Vanc, Levo, and Flagyl for empiric coverage.
CXR showed atlectasis, no consolidation.

# Sepsis - the patient initially presented with hypotension and met SIRS criteria, with most likely source of infection being the urine on admission; however, diagnostic imaging on HD2 revealed eviwith evidence of cholecystitis.
# abdominal distension: pt had evidence of increasing abdominal distension with somewhat localizing pain in the RUQ (difficult to assess per pt's mental status) with KUB showing evidence of dilated loops of bowel.
# Acute renal failure- patient with baseline creatinine 1.1 6 months ago, most recent creatinine 1.28 in [**Month (only) 547**].
IVF resuscitation was continued, nephrotoxins were avoided, and electrolytes were monitored regularly.
# A-fib with [**Month/Day (2) 5509**]- Patient with known a-fib, on AC with coumadin, rate controlled with lopressor.
Feurea = 66.8 (nml).
Guaiac negative in the ED, no iron studies or colonoscopy/EGD on record.
# Elevated troponin- pt poor historian but flat CK less suggestive of ACS.
baseline EKG was not able to be obtained per [**Name (NI) 5509**].
