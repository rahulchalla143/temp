In the ED, initial vitals were Temp 98.7, HR 90, BP 137/88, RR 18, O2 100% Labs and imaging significant for negative troponin and CK-MB.
CTA showed no no PE or aortic dissection.
A bedside echo showed a structure in the LV.
Vitals on transfer were 98.4, 84, 123/70, 22, 100% .
- [**12/2144**]: Again SOB led to echo which showed insuff + cavity adjacent to aortic valve.
The patient was sent to the OR during that hospitalization for a re-op aortic valve replacement, at which time a #21 mechanical valve was placed.
Blood cultures negative throughout.
Emergent cardiac cath revealed high-grade stenosis at the ostium of the left main artery (?secondary to aortic wall edema) which required stenting of the left main and placement of intraaortic balloon pump, which was subsequently weaned.
Rpeat cath at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**10/2145**] showed patent graft.

EKG:  EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm with incomplete RBBB, nonspecific ST and T wave changes.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF=55%).
The current chest pain is not associted with CE elevation and the EKG is unchanged from a seperate admission for chest pain in 10/[**2147**].
Given the negative CTA, unchanged EKG, negative cardiac enzymes, and echo that showed no change in the LVOT pseudoaneurysm and the patient had resolution of her chest pain without reoccurance with activity she was discharged home.
The patient appears to have stable RUL but there appears to be new LLL densities compared to CT 10/[**2147**].
Given the multifocal ground glass and peribronchovascular ground glass opacities a repeat chest CT as an outpatient may be warranted with outpatient evaluation by pulmonary if there is not resolution or progression of the chest CT findings.
You may need to have a repeat CT scan of your lungs and a follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist if the abnormalities on the CT do not resolve with treatment.
Information was obtained from PatientAtrius.
You were admitted to the hospital due to chest pain and concern for cardiac origin of the pain.
However, testing showed no evidence that there was a problem in your heart or with your heart stent.
The CT scan of your lungs did show evidence of a possible infection at the base of both your left and right lungs.
YOu may need to have a repeat CT scan of your lungs and a follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist if the abnormalities on the CT do not resolve with treatment.
