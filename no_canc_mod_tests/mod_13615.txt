In comparison to [**2185-10-16**] EKG, TWI in I is new and axis is more leftward  Repeat EKG 1am: notable for TWI in V5-V6 in setting of HTN 220/110's.
[**5-10**] CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
A hyperenhancing focus is seen in segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] of the liver measuring approximately 4 mm, not completely characterized on single phase study (3:61).
[**5-10**] CXR SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is moderate to marked cardiomegaly, with no evidence of congestive heart failure.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2186-5-11**] there are more T wave inversions in leads V5-V6 which may be due to lead placement.
Discharge Labs: WBC 12.6, Hematocrit 32.1, Plts 467, INR 2.6, Na 141, K 4.2, Cl 92, HCO2 27, BUN 28, Crt 6.0, Gluc 186, AST 49, ALT 58, AlkP 696, T Bili 0.4  Pending Labs: Insulin antibody  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 61289**] is a 25 year old man with ESRD on HD, Type 1 DM, recent PE who presented with hyperkalemia, chest pain, and hypertensive urgency.
He was initially managed on a labetalol drip but subsequently weaned off once his oral/transdermal medications used during his recent [**Hospital1 112**] hospitalization were initiated.
His blood pressure remained difficult to control on an oral regimen as well and his oral labetalol was uptitrated.
His blood pressure goal was 160-180/90-100 during this admission.
This was treated by giving back fluid during dialysis and his blood pressure normalized.
He became more agreeable during the rest of his hospitalization upon transfer to the floor, although commonly refused blood pressures and blood sugar monitoring.
His cardiac enzymes were negative.
His INR at discharge was 2.6 and his heparin drip was stopped.
He will need close monitoring of his INR after discharge.
He will have his labs drawn at dialysis and faxed to his primary care provider.
Upon review of his records from [**Hospital1 112**], he was extensively worked up there with RUQ ultrasound, hepatitis serologies, ceruloplasmin, automimmune workup, hemochromatosis labs, as well as other viral serologies.

Outpatient Lab Work You should have your potassium and INR checked at your dialysis center on [**2186-5-19**] and [**2186-5-22**].
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with high potassium levels and high blood pressure.
You underwent dialysis while you were here and your potassium levels returned to [**Location 213**].
You had a low Coumadin level (INR) on admission and were placed on a heparin drip until your INR was in therapeutic range.
It is important that you take your Coumadin at home and that you have your INR checked when you are at dialysis.
