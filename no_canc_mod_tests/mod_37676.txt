LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Conclusions: Pre-Ablation: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Remaining exam is unchanged.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
He continued to do well but remained for evaluation of sq emphysema and apical pneumothorax.
He was ready for discharge home POD 5 with plan for f/u CXR [**3-7**] and wound check.
