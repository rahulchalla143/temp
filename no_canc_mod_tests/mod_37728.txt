She was managed with ivf, albumin and lasix to approach a urine output higher than 100 cc/hr.
A liver ultrasound revealed patent hepatic vasculature.
On POD3 the urine output decreased significantly to 15 cc/hr.
She was stable hemodynamically, the LFTs were coming down, but the creatinine was still between 4.0 and 5.0.
She was doing well and both the kidney and the liver JPs were pulled on POD4 and 5.
Stool samples for C. diff were sent and were negative x3, so it was managed successfully with Imodium.
Due to her poor kidney function, a kidney biopsy was performed on [**2122-1-27**], showing no evidence of acute cellular or humoral rejection.
The Hct went down from 28 to 22 the day after the biopsy.
A post-biopsy hematoma was found posterior to the right lower quadrant renal transplant.
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was isolated from that specimen, thus Micafungin was started and ID recs were followed.
Her blood sugars improved during the following 2 days and went back to a regular insulin sliding scale.
As she has been treated with Bactrim and due to her PNC allergy and QT prolongation, atb treatment was restricted enough to decide to wait for the urine cultures and follow this up.
