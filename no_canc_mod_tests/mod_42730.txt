His hospital course was complicated by respiratory failure, troponin elevation, and ETT dislodgement requiring reintubation.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation by the interventional pulmonary service.
The patient was initially hospitalized for bilateral lower extremity cellitis, treated with Unasyn, and subsequently vancomycin when left ankle culture grew MRSA.
Exam was notable for fever to 102.2, tachycardia, lower extremity cellulitis, symmetric weakness.
Labs on admission notable for creatinine 2.0.
Rapid strep testing was negative.
Bronchoscopy showed arytenoid joint dislocations, subglottic stenosis, and tracheobronchomalacia.
EKG showed sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, TWI in aVL.

The patient was transferred to our MICU team with the two most active issues as respiratory abnormalities and h/o respiratory failure at OSH, as well as EKG changes and cardiac enzymes concerning for NSTEMI.
As such, the patient underwent a cardiac cath which showed 3vd as per report, and received a BMS to the proximal LAD.
Soon after, the patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy which did not reveal any pathology.
A w/u was negative (including a head CT) and thought of AMS was toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, and thought of weakness was [**1-1**] ICU and prolonged hospitalization.
A CK was negative.
He was eventually transferred to a rehab facility for further strength conditioning as well as clearing of his MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] did have a persistent leukocytosis which was downtrending at time of discharge and an eosinophilia which was stable.
Serial EKGs obtained and enzymes followed.
Echo revealed EF 50-55% and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid septal hypokinesis.
He underwent cath with a BMS to LAD on [**4-25**] and was started on [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], atorvastatin, and metoprolol.
He remained CP free and repeat EKG was reassuring.
# Upper airways abnormalities: Bronchoscopy [**2194-4-20**] showed arytenoid joint dislocation, subglottic stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia extending to the BIM at the OSH.
Intubated, CT neck/chest without contrast obtained and IP consulted but wanted to hold off until cardiology cleared him.
Respiratory cultures were obtained from OSH that showed Klebsiella and his zosyn (that was started at the OSH) was changed to ctx.
Sputum cultures showed sparse growth of gram negative rods speciated to klebsiella.
O/w, a head CT was done which was wnl.
TSH, RPR, B12, folate were wnl.
He was started on metoprolol and uptitrated to HR and BP goals.
His atenolol was originally d/c'ed at time of transfer to the MICU [**1-1**] prolonged QTc.
His BPs were under better control, however medication titration will likely need to be continued in the outpt setting.
Out of concern for adrenal insufficiency, AM cortisol checked which was wnl.
Also, LFTs checked which were wnl to r/o DRESS.
Diureses with lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] was initiated to help with vent weaning which showed improvement of pulmonary edema.
As above, his diuretics were held at time of discharge.
Cultures revealed Klebsiella in sputum so likely a pneumonia.
We did a thorough w/u of further infection, and the patient was treated with another round of CTX x 8 days given UTI and persistent scant kleb on sputum cx.
A thorough evaluation was done for infection (blood Cx, Urine Cx, LFTs, CXR, skin evaluation) which was all negative.
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine 2.0 on presntation to OSH with lytes c/w pre-renal picture.
CT head was wnl.
TSH, B12, folate, RPR were normal.
