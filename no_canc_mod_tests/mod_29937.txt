On admission, patient was not found to have any injuries but did have a CT scan showing a new rectal mass, pancreatic tail mass that is increased in size, and multiple pulmonary nodules.
Her CT also showed mild small bowel thickening with possible thickening consistent with gastroenteritis or ischemia.
Lactate trended down from 2 to 1.2.
Patient was seen by gastroenterology for visceral masses and an NGT was placed.
Surgery was consulted after repeat CT showed worsened small bowel thickening and interloop fluid.

Since the previous tracing of 11 [**9-25**] the rate is faster.
CT ABDOMEN PELVIS [**2153-2-6**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute disease.
The other pulmonary nodules seen on the prior CT are not included on this study and follow is recommended per the [**2152-11-23**] report.
CT ABDOMEN PELVIS [**2153-2-9**] 1.
Eccentric wall thickening in the right posterior rectum and pancreatic tail cystic lesion, are similar to the prior study and need further evaluation.
CT Head [**2153-2-16**]: No acute intracranial process.
EEG [**2153-2-15**]: Abnormal EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the background, bursts of generalized slowing, and occasional left frontocentral sharp waves.
CXR [**2153-3-1**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the left pigtail catheter has been removed.
Initial CT demonstrated some small bowel thickening which was non specific and consistent with gastroenteritis versus ischemia from a low flow state from her recent hypotension.
Pain initially improved with NG decompression but subsequently worsened prompting repeat CT which showed worsened small bowel thickening and interloop fluid.
# HYPOTENSION- Patient was initially hypotensive in the emergency department with SBP in the 70s.
Blood pressure improved with administration of IVF and remained stable on admission to the floor.
Her anti-hypertensives including lisinopril and diltiazem were initially held.
As below diltaizem was restarted on HD 1 for heart rate control.
# RECTAL MASS- CT was concerning for rectal wall thickening.
Rectal exam was notable for a soft mildly tender mass.
# PANCREATIC MASS- Patient noted to have a cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail unchanged from a CT done in [**11-26**] but new increasing in size from [**2148**].
This was not further evaluation on this hospitalization given the patients acute illness.
She will need a MRCP for further evaluation .
Blood remained stable and the patient was asymptomatic.
# ACUTE on CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE- Patients creatinine was elevated from her baseline of 1.4 to 1.6 on admission.
This was felt to likely be pre-renal in etiology as creatinine improved to baseline with administration of IVF.
On HD 3 creatinine trended upward to 2.0 and urine output decreased suggesting poor renal perfusion.
# CAD- Patient was continued on her home beta blocker and aspirin # GERD- Patient was continued on omeprazole # DM- Patients home glyburide was held and she was maintained on a ISS #Schizoaffective disorder- Patient was continued on seroquel                            ** AFTER SURGICAL ASSESSMENT ** Surgical consultation was requested on [**2153-2-9**] and exam was consistent with peritonitis.
She was taken to the OR emergently for exploratory laparotomy where a closed loop obstruction was discovered with ischemic small bowel.
Neurology was consulted and Head CT showed no abnormalities.
EEG showed diffuse slowing and no evidence of ongoing seizures.
CV: Her pressors were weaned off following aggressive fluid resusitation.
Echo performed on POD 3 showed good systolic function and adequate volumes.
Once hemodynamically stable, she was diuresed with lasix to good effect, however a rising Creatinine limited the ability to push her diuresis.
She displayed bilateral pleural effusions which were resistant to medical diuresis, so bilateral chest tubes were placed which each drained several liters of transudate prior to being removed HD 22 and 24.
A post pull chest x-ray on [**3-1**] revealed no reaccumulation of pleural effusions and remnant basal atelectasis on the left.
The following day her wound was opened and culture grew MRSA so vanco was added to the regimen.
She returned to the operating [**2153-2-18**] for another ex-lap with small bowel resection and primary anastamosis.
A CT abdomen [**2-26**] confirmed no anastomotic leak.
She did respond to lasix, however, a gradually rising Cr (1.3 on POD #2) limited our ability to diurese her.
Heme: Patient was transfused 1U of blood on POD#0.
Her Hct was stable and she was given heparin sc for DVT prophylaxis, then heparin drip while transitioning to coumadin.

You sustained no injuries from your fall but a new mass in your rectum as well as increase in the size of the known mass in your pancreas was seen on CT scan.
It is recommended that you have a sigmoidoscopy to biopsy the rectal mass as well as a study called an MRCP to further evaluate the mass seen on your pancreas.
