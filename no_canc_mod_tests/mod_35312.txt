A CTA revealed prominent aortic valve calcification, a 2-mm lingular nodule; if patient has a history of smoking or other lung cancer risk factors, this could be reassessed in one year's time, otherwise no follow up recommended, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] Society guidelines and a few scattered calcified pleural plaques, the sequela of remote asbestos exposure, with basilar subpleural reticulation, greater at the right base, suggestive of possible early fibrotic changes.
As she was thrombocytopenic, a HIT was sent which was negative.
A serotonin assay was then sent which is pending.
On postoperative day two, she was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
