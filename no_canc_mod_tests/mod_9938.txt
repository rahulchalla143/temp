Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Neck examination revealed supple.
Jugular venous pressure at 9 cm.
Pulmonary examination revealed clear to auscultation bilaterally/anteriorly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal examination revealed soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Extremity examination revealed right groin with arterial sheath in place with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission to the outside hospital revealed complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 9.1, hematocrit was 41.2, and platelets were 245.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 139, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was 19, creatinine was 0.8, and blood glucose was 143.
Calcium was 9.4.
Liver function tests revealed ALT was 23, AST was 25, alkaline phosphatase was 582, and LDH was 25.
Coagulations on admission to [**Hospital1 1444**] revealed prothrombin time was 13.3, INR was 1.2, and partial thromboplastin time was 28.6.
Electrocardiogram #2 at the outside hospital revealed a normal sinus rhythm with persistent intraventricular conduction delay; consistent with right bundle-branch block, now with inferior Q waves.
Electrocardiogram #3 at the outside hospital revealed a normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions, ST elevations in lead III, with resolved ST elevations in aVF.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with left heart catheterization demonstrating a normal left main artery, mildly diseased left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery, and 95% medial right coronary artery stenosis.
The right heart catheterization demonstrated elevated filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 17, right ventricular pressures of 45/23, pulmonary artery pressure of 42/23, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22.
The patient ruled in for an inferior myocardial infarction with a peak creatine kinase of 1011, peak MB of 90, and CK/MB index of 8.9.
On hospital day three, the patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram which demonstrated depressed left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 40%, hypokinesis of the posterior and inferior left ventricular walls, and 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation.
A lipid panel was performed which demonstrated low-density lipoprotein was 73, high-density lipoprotein was 59, total cholesterol was 144, and triglycerides were 60.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%.
