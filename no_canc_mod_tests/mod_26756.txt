Significant decreased mean transit time in the left perisylvian temporal lobe likely represents location of patient's recent infarction which is not well visualized on a non-contrast head CT study.
Of note, head CT can be insensitive method for evaluation of early infarction.
CTA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] is grossly normal; however, a question question is raised of obstruction of a small branch of the left middle cerebral artery at its trifurcation.
MRI/MRA Head: Diffusion images demonstrate an area of slow diffusion in the left subinsular region involving the left putamen and extending to corona radiata indicative of an acute left lenticulostriate territory infarct.
This infarct is in the distribution of delayed transit time and reduced blood flow on CT perfusion.
A subtle area of increased signal in the medial right temporal lobe on diffusion images appears to be secondary to artifacts.
MRA OF THE HEAD: Head MRA demonstrates subtle decrease in the branches in the left sylvian region of middle cerebral artery.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
