2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Further review of the cath films showed diffuse disease in her RCA and OM-1.
Her cardiac enzymes were followed until they began to trend downward.
Her beta-blocker and ACE-I were held due to BP issues.
A repeat echo several days post-cath showed improvement and her heparin was stopped.
We believe she was hypovolemic at that point, and her BP responded well to a 1L fluid bolus.
Echo was done several days later as above, and showed an EF of 45-50%.
Retroperitoneal bleed was a question, so she had an abdominal CT which was negative for this.
Her electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed.
