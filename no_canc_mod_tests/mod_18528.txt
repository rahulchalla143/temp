EKG showed ST elevations in V2 with Qs in II and aVF and hyperacute T waves in V3 with ST depression in V5-6.
Troponin was 15.65 and CK was 603 and MB was 123.
He also had a transaminitis, a Cr of 1.8 and a U/A positive for Leuk Esterase and WBCs.
He was hypotensive with a SBP of 80-100 s/p 1500cc fluid bolus.
Here he underwent a cardiac catheterization where he was found to have a total occlusion of the mid LAD, subtotal occlusions of the LCx, and a diffusely calcified RCA.

Cardiac Cath at [**Hospital1 18**] [**9-21**] 1.
Hemodynamics revealed severe elevation of right and left filling pressures with PCWP of 29mmHG and mean RA of 15mmHG.
The cardiac output was severely depressed with index of 1.46 by Fick.
Ventriculogram was deferred due to heavy dye burden 4.
2) S/P STEMI - He had a difficult PTCA to mid LAD only, with cath complicated by difficulty passing wire.
4) Infection - He was treated with levofloxacin 250 daily for a UTI, then vancomycin, ceftaz, and flagyl for empiric coverage.
5) GI Bleed - He had guaiac positive stool on exam at his first cath on [**9-22**], but his Hct remained stable.
He was treated with bicarbonate, but this was stopped when his cardiac output continued to drop despite the treatment.
