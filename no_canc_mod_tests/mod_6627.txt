Pt was extubated [**2143-11-15**] and was seen for a bedside swallow on [**2143-11-18**], followed by a video on [**2143-11-19**].
Pt was made NPO after the video swallow due to fatigue and aspiration combined with overall medical status.
We returned today to see if pt was ready for a repeat evaluation.

It was recommended pt been seen for a repeat video swallow, as pt would likely be able to use compensatory techniques given improved status if needed to resume PO intake, whether trials or meals, however per discussion with team, pt is scheduled for d/c early tomorrow.
