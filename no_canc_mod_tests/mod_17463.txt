Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**6-4**] CT A Head and neck: 1.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest x 2.
She was diuresed aggressively with improvement in her CXR findings and exam but she remained intubated for several days.
Ultimately, since her respiratory status improved with diuresis and antibiotics, PE was considered lower on the differential.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and EKGs were obtained; however, this was thought not to be a primary ischemic event.
Her underlying rhythm was sinus but she has known hx of atrial fibrillation.
As a result, ventricular pacing to lead to AV disassociation and so it was turned off.
We augmented her heart rate with dobutamine to maintain adequate perfusion as per cardiac output calculations.
Atrial pacing was restarted with good blood pressure thereafter.
Initial [**Location (un) 1131**] showed low SVR with low CI.
When her pacermaker generator was replaced, she was better able to maintain her blood pressure and her pressors were weaned on [**2166-6-7**].
Stat neuro consult and head CT showed left MCA territory embolic infarct, likely of cardioembolic etiology.
Serial exams were performed and the patient appeared to gradually recover some function of her speech (pt can hold simple conversations) and her right extremities.
Speech and swallow evaluation cleared the patient for po puree.
Plan to continue lovenox injections to bridge to therapeutic INR [**1-18**].
KUB showed a nonspecific gas pattern and no free air under the diaphragm.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): To be adjusted based on INR and overlap with therapeutin INR on lovenox for 72 hours.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
