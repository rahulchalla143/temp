The patient was transferred from the OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-18**] where CT showed a 5mm left-sided subdural hematoma (possibly acute on chronic) and a small L temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage with no evidence of acute infarct.
Vital signs were stable and exam was nonfocal on admission.
Repeat CT on [**11-19**] was unchanged, and the patient was transferred to the floor on telemetry.
Past Medical History: Hypercholesterolemia Depression Question early dementia - recent forgetfulness Hypothyroidism treated with Synthroid The patient also reports a cardiac catheterization at the [**Hospital1 112**] 6yrs ago which was normal.
The cath was done for a "lab abnormality".

[**11-19**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Unchanged L convexity subdural hematoma and small subarachnoid hemorrhage .
[**11-19**] CXR (port AP): FINDINGS:  Opaque tubes somewhat obscure the right lower lung.
[**11-20**] Echo: IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function (LV EF > 55%).
[**11-22**] CT head w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
An evolving infarction may also be considered.
The planned brain MRI will be helpful for further evaluation.
[**11-22**] MRI brain & neck w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
Left temporal abnormality visualized on the recent CT consistent with hemorrhagic contusion and not with recent infarction.
Small multifocal subdural hematomas, probably unchanged, allowing for differences in technique between CT and MR. 4.

# SDH/SAH: The patient was initially admitted to the Neuro ICU, where she remained neurologically intact with stable findings on serial CT scans.
There were no meningeal signs on exam and neurologic exam remained unchanged.
A repeat CT head was negative for rebleed and expansion of bleed.
An MRI was performed, with findings consistent with hemorrhagic concussion and surrounding edema.
The patient was ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes negative x 3 with no concerning EKG changes for ischemia.
The patient was monitored on telemetry during admission with no significant events.
Echo showed normal heart function and no evidence of valvular stenosis.
Carotid US and MRA of the neck were without significant stenosis on both sides.
EEG was negative for epileptiform foci.
Circumstances surrounding fall still remain unclear, but syncope workup was negative with no further evidence of syncope.
# Fever: During the admission the patient spiked a temperature to 101.4 with no leukocytosis and no localizing symptoms.
Urinalysis was negative but cultures were positive for 10-100K enterococcus without urinary symptoms.
Patient also exhibited evidence of early mild-cognitive impairment, given word-finding difficulties and finger apraxia on exam which may be more pronounced after recent head trauma.
Echo with normal cardiac function and LV EF > 55%.
She was given instructions to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] in 4wks with a head CT prior to the appointment.
This was found to be stable on CT scans throughout your hospital course.
You will need a CT scan of the brain with or without contrast prior to this visit.
