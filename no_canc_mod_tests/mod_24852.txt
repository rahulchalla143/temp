Notably, her work-up in [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 21601**] was negative for HIV, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Syphilis, but she was EBV positive.
Her initial LP on [**10-29**] when she was admitted over there showed 400 white cells with a 95% lymphocytic predominance, 0 red cells, 45 glucose, and 106 total protein.
Two days before she was discharged on [**11-3**], her LP showed the following: 571 white cells, 14 red cells, 1 neutrophil, 91 lymphocytes.
She was treated empirically with Rocephin+Vanc+Acyclovir, and the Acyclovir was discontinued when the HSV PCR came back negative, on the initial CSF tap on [**10-29**].
She had a CT head at [**Location (un) 47**], which was unremarkable (apart from movement artifact) and she received a dose of Acyclovir, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurological care.

Followup evaluation in a few days/weeks can be considered based on the patient's condition/progression to evaluate the stability/progression of the above-mentioned equivocal abnormalities.
MRI ([**2166-11-14**]): 1.
Subtle signal abnormalities in medulla, pons and thalami need further confirmation with repeat sagittal FLAIR and T2 and axial FLAIR (without gadolinium).
However, this could not be confirmed, and if clinically indicated, a dedicated MRI of the orbit can help for further assessment.
EEG ([**2166-11-18**])  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
EEG ([**2166-11-15**]): Abnormal EEG due to bursts of focal slowing from the left temporal and central regions with secondary generalization indicative of some degree of focal irritation involving primarily the left hemisphere and primarily the left temporal and central structures independently and, at times, synchronously with secondary spread.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function.
She was initially placed on antibiotics for empiric treatment of meningitis, however these were discontinued after a day with the results of the gram stain and culture of the LP.
An EEG was obtained that was abnormal showing: focal slowing from the left temporal and central regions with secondary generalization indicative of some degree of focal irritation involving primarily the left hemisphere and primarily the left temporal and central structures independently and the patient was started on Keppra.
The HSV PCR was negative and acyclovir was discontinued.
You were brought to [**Hospital1 18**] where you were placed in the ICU and another workup was done, including LP and blood work and imaging.
The workup at the [**Hospital 8050**] hospital was negative, as well as the workup here.
You had another HSV PCR which was shown to be negative.
There is a Bartonella test still pending which you will follow up with infectious disease in about 3 weeks.
You had an EEG which showed some abnormailites, and based on your recent infection and episode of confusion you were started on an anti-epileptic medication Keppra.
