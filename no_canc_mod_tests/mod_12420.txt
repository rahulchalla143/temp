Her R-pupil was 5mm, non-reactive and the L was 1 mm reactive.
CT head was obtained and possible R-MCA sign.
CT angio not abtained.

Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Sinus bradycardia with a rate of 54 bpm is recorded.
NIHSS was 7, with dysarthria, partial weakness of left arm and left leg, initially neglect on the left.
CT showed possible R-MCA sign.
Frequent neuro and blood pressure checks were performed and patient had tight glycemic control.
Patient was also monitored on telemetry and cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative x3.
Peak CK 1658 and trop 0.02.
No prior EKG to compare however normal sinus rhythm, bradycardic, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T changes or TWI inversions.
Carotid US was negative for significant stenosis and 2D ECHO showed EF>55% and mild LV diastolic dysfunction.
Fasting lipid panel and HGBA1C were within normal limits.
MRI/MRA brain showed "several foci of restricted diffusion involving the right frontal lobe, the right insular cortex and the periventricular white matter, abutting the right caudate nucleus consistent with multiple embolic subacute infarcts along the anterior division of the MCA and the lenticulostriate branches" and "attenuation of the right distal MCA near the trifurcation including the anterior and frontal temporal branch consistent with thrombus formation and partial occlusion," consistent with her clinical symptoms.
During the rest of her hospital course, her blood pressure was controlled first with a betablocker, then ACE-I when her HR was too low.
Her brother-in-law will be coming to [**Name (NI) 86**] early next week to take her back to PR.
