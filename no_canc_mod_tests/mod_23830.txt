She went to Good [**Hospital 84038**] Medical Center and initial CT head showed subtle hyperdensity along anterior falx with possible dural thickening vs. small subdural.
A repeat CT head was done five hours later due to worsening agitation which revealed increasing hyperdensity of 1.3 cm along falx consistent with expanding/hyperacute SDH.
Initial INR was 2.6 and she was given vitamkin K 10mg IM and 1 unit FFP and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Repeat Head CT 24 hours later was stable.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
A trauma evaluation was requested to rule out any further injuries.
However, overnight on HD 0 she dropped her HCT from 29 to 21.
She recieved 2U of PRBCs, and her repeat crit was 25.
Her 24 hour repeat head CT was stable, as there was no increase in the falx SDH.
Her neurological exam remained intact and unchanged.
LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA: The medicine service was consulted to evaluate her lower extremity edema, which had been increasing for approx 2 weeks prior to her hospitilization, and increased while an inpatient as well.
They also obtained an Echo which revealed an EF of 55%, therefore, not contributing to the patient's edema.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
