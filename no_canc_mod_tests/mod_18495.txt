Echocardiogram demonstrated EF >55% but 2+ MR with paravalvular leak, severe TR and RV overload.
She was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] CT surgery for evlauation of 3rd MVR.
She underwent RHC and LHC and then was transferred to the CCU for tailored CHF therapy prior to MVR surgery.

Selective coronary angiography demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease in this right dominant circulation.
Resting hemodynamics from right and left cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP of 10 mmHg and LVEDP of 14 mmHg and mean PCWP of 26 mmHg).
Cardiac output and index were 3.4 L/min and 2.4 L/min/m2 respectively.
Prominent V-waves on PCWP tracing consistent with significant mitral regurgitation.
