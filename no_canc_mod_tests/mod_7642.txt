There an ABG was done which showed an ABG of 7.42, 62, and 55.
She had a head CT that was negative.
Chest x-ray that was questionable left lower lobe infiltrate.
Lumbar puncture was performed and the micro cultures are still pending.
She also had a K of 6.0 and given 30 of Kayexalate, 5 of Haldol, 2 mg of Ativan given for agitation, and 2 mg of ceftriaxone was given for a temperature of 101.3 with a concern for meningitis as a LP was done prior.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], she was unresponsive with an oxygen saturation of 72% on 6 liters.
She was placed on 50% vent mask, which improved her oxygenation to 97%.
Original ABG here before BiPAP was 7.19, 102, and 92.
After being placed on BiPAP, her blood pressure decreased to the 80s.
She responded to 1 liter of IV fluids, normal saline and blood pressure remained stable.
When laying flat, her sats decreased to 50% on 30% FIO2, PEEP of 10, and pressure support of 5.
Once the patient sat up, her sats improved and her airway was no longer obstructed.
After a history on BiPAP about a half an hour, her ABG was 7.29, 79, and 106 on 30% pressure support of 5 and PEEP of 10.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 108, blood pressure 140/82, oxygen saturation 96%, respiratory rate of 22 on BiPAP 5/10/30%.
PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 12.8 (79% polys, 13% lymphocytes, 8 monocytes, nucleated RBCs 1%), hematocrit 31.7.
Potassium 5.2, creatinine 1.3, BUN 35, glucose 152, D dimer 1636, INR 1.3.
Urine cultures pending.
LABORATORIES AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White count 11.8 (90% polys, 4% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 1% basophils, 3% nucleated RBCs).
Potassium 6.6, creatinine 1.4, alkaline phosphatase 302, T bilirubin 0.6, AST 25, ALT 84, CK of 15, troponin 0.01.
Chest x-ray rotated low lung volumes, hazy opacities at bases.
Echocardiogram in [**2127**]:  Mild-to-moderate MR, TR.
She was placed on pressure support, which improved her saturations and decreased her hypercarbia.
Patient was eventually placed on BiPAP on hospital day three, on the date prior to discharge of BiPAP settings of [**12-24**]/5 liters of oxygen with saturations of 96% with a gas of 7.38, 67, and 91 with an aim of a goal pCO2 of 67.
B12, folate, RPR were all sent that were unremarkable as causes for delta MS.  We are awaiting results of the lumbar puncture from the outside hospital, but on hospital day two.
Those cultures are still pending at the time.
A chest x-ray with bilateral patchy infiltrates likely pneumonia and UTI.
Blood cultures and urine cultures are still pending at this hospital visit and the CSF fluid from [**Hospital1 882**] needs to be further evaluated.
Patient on the day of discharge was afebrile with a decreasing white count x48 hours.
Acute renal failure issues:  Creatinine initially presented at 1.3.
A FENa was sent, was 0.3%.
On hospital day two, her creatinine returned to 0.8, and she remained with a creatinine of 0.8 for the remainder of her hospital stay.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed that showed no hepatic or biliary pathology likely due to acute phase stress changes given the fact that she had no clinical symptoms.
Congestive heart failure history:  Patient was stable without evidence of CHF on chest x-ray.
Followed her sats likely due to obstructive-sleep apnea and hypoventilation.
Patient was restarted on her beta blocker and .......-receptor blocker on hospital day two given that her creatinine had stabilized.
Her hematocrit remained stable throughout this course.
Reticulocyte count was performed that was negative.
DISPOSITION:  The patient is to be discharged today to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for long-term pulmonary ........ therapy and further evaluation of her obstructive-sleep apnea.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient was stable with complete clearance of her mental status, advancement of her diet, blood pressure, and heart rate remained stable, and her oxygen saturations were well above 90% during the daytime on 2 liters nasal cannula and at night on the BiPAP settings described above.
NPH 70 units q.a.m., 50 units q.p.m.
