In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were 98.6, 80, 110/63, 16 and100%on RA.
EKG shows new TWI in lead V2, no other changes.
Placed in observation and underwent nuclear scan that showed a reversible distal anterior wall and apical perfusion defect.
Given the findings on the nuclear study, the patient underwent catheterization that revealed an osteal lesion not amenable to intervention.
CT surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding surgical intervention.
