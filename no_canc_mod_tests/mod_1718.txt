The ileostomy was created approximately 1 month ago, and since then the patient has been doing well up until yesterday when the ileostomy output suddenly stopped and the patient developed significant abdominal pain.
Initial imaging studies with KUB and CT scan were consistent with small bowel obstruction close to the ileostomy, and there was some concern whether the patient had intraluminal content that created a mechanical obstruction.
The KUB and CT scan did not show any evidence of free air.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHO [**2118-11-22**]: Cannot fully exclude a vegetation on the mitral valve; no vegetations seen elsewhere.
CXR [**12-1**]-PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to [**2118-11-26**].
ECHO [**2118-12-12**]- Severe focal LV hypokinesis consistent with CAD.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2118-11-22**], the findings are probably similar.

Lasix was restarted at the same dose as was used pre-op to attempt to reduce the edema that was still present in her legs, arms, and breast--more so on the left side.
Ectopy noticed on telemetry, but Metoprolol not titrated up given lower SBP in 90's and HR in 40's.
Given that her SBP was in the 90's, she was transferred back to the ICU for further management.
Blood cultures drawn revealed a new bacteremia, likely PICC-associated.
TTE was not conclusive in ruling out valve vegetation, so TEE was performed which revealed vegetations on her ICD lead.
MRSA PICC-associated bacteremia, endocarditis of intracardiac device: ID and electrophysiology were consulted.
She is being sent home on Vancomycin and Rifampin and will need to follow-up with the [**Hospital **] clinic (scheduled) and receive safety labs through the duration of her course, which will be completed on [**2119-1-9**].
Pt underwent repeat echo on [**12-12**] that was stable.
This was complicated by post op hypotension which required an ICU stay and use of 1 pressor.
She was able to be weaned from the pressor and sent to the regular medical floor.
Lower GI bleed/Crohns disease/Hemorrhoidal Bleeding: This occurred on [**11-27**] while on prednisone 40mg daily.
She had maroon stools without blood clots, HCT remained stable and the source was likely a stricture related to her Crohn's disease.
On [**12-5**] the nurse noted the mesalamine being excreted in the ostomy bag, and her mesalamine was changed to enema which was given via the ostomy, as well as adding Cortifoam enemas via the ostomy.
A flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed which noted grade 3 hemorrhoids, which were banded on [**12-6**] by the colorectal surgery team.
Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: As her blood pressures improved her beta blocker was up titrated up and she was started on digoxin with a load of 0.5mg daily x 2 days then on digoxin 125mcg daily.
Her Digoxin level remained wnl at 0.6-0.7 despite the occurrence of renal failure.
Anasarca and asymmetric breast edema: Related to steroid use in the setting of systolic congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%.
A CT scan was done that showed an SBO at loop ileostomy site.
An NGT and foley catheter was placed to decompress stomach.
However she continued to have abdominal pain with peritoneal signs and leukocytosis 20 K. On [**2118-12-26**] patient was taken emergently to the operating room and was found to have a perforation of small bowel at the site of the ileostomy with purulent peritonitis.
A wound swab from the OR grew Lactobacillus and VRE.
She was bolused for decrease urine output was given intravenous fluids and Albumin.
On [**2118-12-28**] decrease hematocrit from 30.5 to 22.4, transfused with 2 units red blood cell.
POD 7 [**2118-12-30**], Prelone 21 mg PO taper was started and he will continue her Prelone taper per her gastroenterologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] refer to GI note.
POD 9 she had approx 50 cc of blood from rectum, a stat hematocrit was drawn,35.2 and had no further episodes and is stable for transfer to rehabilitation center.
