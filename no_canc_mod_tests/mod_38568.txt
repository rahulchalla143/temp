While in the Emergency Department, the patient was found to have a hematocrit of 29.4.
An nasogastric lavage was performed which revealed 1200 cc.
of clotted blood and fresh blood which did not clear.
He displayed no evidence of further bleeding and serial hematocrits were stable.
His INR was also noted to be 2.0 and to avoid further re-bleeding, Vitamin K was administered to reverse his coagulopathy.
LABORATORY:  Pertinent labs and studies were hematocrit 34.2 (up from 29.4 on [**2139-7-21**]); white blood cell count 6.0; platelets 76; PTT 39.1, PT 15.4, INR 1.6, BUN 21, creatinine 1.4, AST 174, ALT 53, alkaline phosphatase 138, albumin 2.2.
Hepatitis B surface antigen negative.
Abdominal ultrasound with small ascites, no portal vein thrombosis.
Amylase 318, lipase 48, total bilirubin 3.0.
No evidence of free bleeding on serial hematocrits has been noted with the most recent hematocrit 37.7.
We are attempting to keep his INR at less than 1.4 with Vitamin K supplementation subcutaneously.
The patient does have a history of having a liver biopsy performed at an outside hospital although we were unable to obtain the pathology report.
His hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
His abdominal ultrasound also revealed a small amount of ascites.
The patient may benefit from a repeat outpatient liver biopsy for further evaluation.
His folate and B12 levels were also checked and neither were deficient with a B12 of greater than [**2137**] and a folate of 14.6.
His anemia may be consistent with anemia of chronic disease since patient has a normal iron of 163 and a low TIBC of 176.
His hematocrit has been  stable after a total of six units packed red blood cells since admission.
His anemia may be worked up further as an outpatient.
His FEna was 5.4 based upon calculations from his urine electrolytes.
He will also need further evaluation when he is discharged.
He is to have his PT/INR level to insure that his INR remains below 1.4.
