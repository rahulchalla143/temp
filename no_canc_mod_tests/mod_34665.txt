Repeat HCT showed a 12mm left temporal hemorrhage.
On arrival BP was 94/63, but rose to 229/112, and she was put on a propofol gtt with some control of her BP.

This is not present on prior study of earlier same day.
MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK AND HEAD:  The arterial vasculature was within normal limits.
3-dimensional time-of-flight imaging of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and its tributaries is also within normal limits.
CARDIAC ECHO; The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: 71yo RHF with PMH significant for HTN and  presents with initial headache, dysarthria, then right hemiparesis at an OSH, with decreased responsiveness and head CT showing interval development of a small left temporal hemorrhage.
On [**2-5**] she was thought to have decreased responsiveness in the context of a low-grade fever, repeat HCT remained stable, was tx with one dose of Ceftriaxone empirically.
She had a cough but nml CXR, normal urinalysis and negative blood cultures.
Cardiac echo showed mild L ventricular regional dysfunction with borderline normal systolic function.
Abnormal labs to follow-up: Creat 1.2, BUN 24, ESR 35, CRP 71.9.
Followup Instructions: Neurology: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] Date/Time: Tuesday [**2131-4-3**] 4:00 Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**]  YOU WILL NEED A FOLLOW-UP MRI and MRA BRAIN WITH CONTRAST AT THAT TIME, PLEASE CALL RADIOLOGY AT [**Telephone/Fax (1) 327**] TO SCHEDULE THIS (IT CAN BE DONE EARLIER THAT SAME AFTERNOON)  Please make a follow-up appointment with your Primary Care Physician.
(your kidney function was mildly abnormal with Creatinine 1.2, BUN 24, and should be followed-up by your PCP; also it is important you maintain good blood pressure control as that can worsen bleeding into the brain).
