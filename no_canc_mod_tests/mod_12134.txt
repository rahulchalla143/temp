Referred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate her aortic stenosis.
Cardiac catheterization done on [**1-10**] showed an aortic valve area of .38 cm.sq., with a mean gradient of 62, and a peak gradient of 85.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension, PA pressure 48/24, 1+ mitral regurgitation, severe aortic stenosis with an LVEDP of 19 and an ejection fraction of 43%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs:  Heart rate 108 and regular, blood pressure 145/76, respiratory rate 20, height 5'2", weight 141 pounds.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, anicteric, not injected.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities.
Pulses:  Femoral 2+ bilaterally, dorsalis pedis 1+ bilaterally, posterior tibial 1+ bilaterally, and radial 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:   White count 5.3, hematocrit 43, platelets 200.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.9, chloride 102, CO2 25, BUN 24, creatinine 0.9, glucose 309.
Chest x-ray is pending at the time of physical.
The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period, however, her blood pressure remained somewhat labile.
Therefore, she was continued on a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 110.
At the time of transfer, the patient's physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.4, heart rate 78 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 106/50, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
Weight preoperatively was 67 kg, at discharge is 70.9 kg.
Laboratory data on [**2-18**]:  White count 4.1, hematocrit 23, platelets 144.
Sodium 141, potassium 4.3, chloride 108, CO2 25, BUN 24, creatinine 0.8, glucose 140.
