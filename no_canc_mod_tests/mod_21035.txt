Glucose was 122.
Although the examination fluctuated, initial NIH stroke scale score was 12 for inability to answer month and age (2), failure to follow commands (2), right facial droop (1), decreased movement of both lower extremities - likely a function of comprehension difficulties (2, 2), severe aphasia characterized by relatively fluent non-sensical speech and poor comprehension (2), and dysarthria (1).
Although a stat CT scan was unrevealing, the examination findings were considered concerning for a left MCA stroke.

The ventricles and sulci appear prominent due to involutional change but not overtly changed from prior study and likely appropriate given the patient's age.
MRI/MRA [**2133-2-9**]: MRI BRAIN: There is a moderate to large acute infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory, involving the parietal lobe and insula.
Gradient echo images demonstrate increased susceptibility artifact in a small left parietal portion of the infarct, consistent with blood products.
Evaluation for aneurysms is suboptimal.
Carotid duplex doppler U/S bilateral [**2133-2-9**]: Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 56/13, 60/13, 53/9 cm/sec.
CCA peak systolic velocity is 55 cm/sec.
ECA peak systolic velocity is 71 cm/sec.
On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 36/7, 42/11, 33/9 cm/sec.
CCA peak systolic velocity is 55 cm/sec.
ECA peak systolic velocity is 47 cm/sec.
Brief Hospital Course: Overall, the patient remained comfortable and HDS, with normal and unremarkable VS. By system:  Neuro: Patient had a stroke, Left M2-inferior division, as evidenced by DWI/MRI (see report, above).
Her initial exam findings improved after receiving IV-tPA (right arm regained nearly full strength).
Her LDL was 106, and it was decided at this level, the risks of statin Tx probably outweight the benefits.
Echocardiogram was not pursued at this time.
Carotid imaging was relatively clean (see above).
LDL cholesterol was 106.
3d later, after her SBPs ranged up into the 180s (yet as low as 110s), her labetalol was restarted at home-dose (150mg [**Hospital1 **]) and her HCTZ was re-started initially at half-dose (12.5mg daily).
Please monitor her BPs and re-start this medication if needed for hypertension (>140/90).
Her UCx revealed a multi-drug-resistant E coli species (resistant to Bactrim, Cipro, Ampicillin).
Also, there was an incidental parotid-gland finding on her MRI (see report, above).
