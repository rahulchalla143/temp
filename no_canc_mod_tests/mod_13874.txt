She will follow up with the liver center and get a repeat EGD within a month.
She was pan cultured, a right pleural effusion was tapped and the pleural fluid was transudative with neg cx, sputum cx with no s. pneumonia, m. catarralis, or h. influenza; c diff neg, HIV neg, BCx neg.
Additionally, a urine culture ([**4-5**]) had enterococcus and MRSA [**Last Name (un) 36**] to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she received vancomycin for a short course ([**Date range (1) 26124**]); subsequent UCX [**4-6**] neg; UCx [**4-14**] pending on discharge.
She did not spike a fever after vancomycin and initiation of imipenem, but did continue to have temperatures in the 99-100 range.
Her pulmonary processes were improving by discharge (see below).
* MRSA History: The patient was on contact precautions while admitted; repeat swabs were positive for MRSA.
Subsequent CXRs revealed a new LLL opacity thought to be a nosocomial pneumonia (?
The patient's oxygen requirement decreased after the second thoracentesis and diuresis for CHF, but she was still requiring 2L NC with ambulation; therefore she was discharged with home oxygen as needed while ambulatory.
On SBP prophylaxis.
Albumin was 3.0.
Abd U/S [**4-8**] with only trace ascites, not amenable to tapping.
*Liver nodule: Her abdominal U/S also showed a hyperechoic nodule in the R lobe of the liver which was concerning for HCC with an AFP of 8.7.
Heme * Coagulopathy: Likely a sequelae of cirrhosis; INR was >3.0 early in her hospitalization.
Line care Midline care as needed   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: - ETOH cirrhosis - Esophageal varices complicated by upper GI bleed - Hydrothorax s/p 2 therapeutic paracenteses - Left sided pneumonia - Coagulopathy   Discharge Condition: No further episodes of hematemesis following initial presentation, stable, ambulatory, tolerating an oral diet, no temperatures >100.5 over the past 24 hours.
