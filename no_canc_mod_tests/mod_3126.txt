CT Abdomen/pelvis with contrast [**2168-1-23**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Large anterior abdominal air and fluid collection with peripheral enhancement status post drainage catheter placement is minimally decreased in AP diameter in the superior portion; however, the inferior portion cannot be compared to prior study as it was not included in the field of imaging.
Small amount of heterogeneous and hyperdense material adjacent to the inferior aspect of the liver may represent small amount of blood clot.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2168-1-25**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
The anterior abdominal wall is stable in appearance and likely comprises a combination of gas from the stomach and extensive phlegmon.
Unsuccessful attempted placement of the second inferior pigtail catheter as this area was not in fact a fluid collection, but instead inflammatory phlegmonous tissue.
Preoperative CXR PA/lateral [**2168-1-27**]: CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS: The lungs are clear.
[**3-9**] CXR PA/Lat Right PICC tip is in the upper SVC.
Given concern for abdominal fullness on physical exam, she had a CT-abdomen, which showed evidence of an abdominal abscess around the site of her PEG tube, which was placed on [**2168-1-6**].
Blood cultures from admission also demonstrated Candidemia.
Her hospital course has been complicated by extensive abdominal wall debridement requiring I&D by surgery: [**2168-2-15**] I+D abdominal wound, [**2168-2-13**] I+D abdominal wall infection, and [**2168-2-5**] I+D abdominal wall abscess.
The patient had a colonoscopy and biopsy from [**3-3**] with no diagnostic abnormalities.
She has had multiple stool C. diff and cultures that have returned negative.
However, stool study from [**1-24**] came back positive for AFB [**3-8**] that was shown not to be TB or MAC.
A CT chest with contrast was negative for any signs of active or chronic Tb and respiratory isolation precautions were discontinued per ID recommendations [**3-11**].
HIV viral load has been negative as well.
The AFB cultures from the state lab should be followed-up.
The patient remains jaundiced on physical exam and her LFTs have been fluctuating likely secondary to a combination of her chronic liver diseases, blood transfusions, and TPN.
Her alkaline phosphatase peaked at 1313 and her AST peaked at 104 on [**3-8**].
Her total bilirubin peaked at 8.5 [**3-3**].
Her albumin has been slowly increasing with TPN to 2.5 She is being continued on entecavir/tenofovir and HB viral levels were 192 on [**1-25**], but were undetectable on [**3-10**].
Her bilirubin began trending up again [**3-10**].
Her prednisone was increased to 15mg daily and her bilirubin began to decrease 7.5 at the time of discharge.
# Bacteremia:  The patient was found to have [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17649**] in her blood on [**1-21**].
Her blood cultures also grew Pseudomonas and E.Coli on [**2-24**].
The patient's last positive blood cultures were from [**2-24**] and have remained negative since (last negative culture [**3-10**]).
Her last transfusion was on [**3-7**] and her Hct has remained stable (32-28).
