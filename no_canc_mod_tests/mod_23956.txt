Otherwise, tracing is within normal limits  CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/O Contrast [**2196-10-26**]: IMPRESSION AND PLAN: 1.
Findings could reflect retroperitoneal fibrosis, though correlation with prior history or any prior imaging would be helpful.
Left external iliac, common femoral, and superficial femoral venous thrombosis.
Chest Radiograph [**2196-11-1**]: IMPRESSION: Marked cardiac enlargement predominantly involving the left heart.
Pulmonary vasculature demonstrates upper zone re-distribution pattern but no conclusive evidence for acute infiltrates.
TTE [**2196-11-4**]: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Abdominal Ultrasound w/Dopplers [**2196-11-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Large amount of ascites  CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2196-11-7**]: IMPRESSION: The constellation of findings including an increasing right pleural effusion which is moderately large, massive hiatal hernia, diffuse ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs probably infective or inflammatory, extensive calcification in multiple pleural plaques with extensive intra- abdominal ascites all contribute to the worsening respiratory status.
TTE [**2196-11-8**]: IMPRESSION: Mild concentric hypertrophy with normal biventricular regional and global systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-11-4**], the findings are similar.
A paramembranous VSD is not seen on either study (mentioned in initial report).
The velocity across the aortic valve is now lower  CT Chest [**2196-11-12**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Large right-sided pleural effusion which has increased in size since the study performed five days prior.
Renal Ultrasound [**2196-11-12**]: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.
Non-diagnostic Doppler evaluation due to patient's inability to hold breath.
CT Chest w/o Contast [**2196-11-14**]: FINDINGS: There has been a slight decrease in size of the large right pleural effusion since the previous CT on [**11-12**] with no pneumothorax.
Otherwise, no change since the CT torso on [**2196-11-12**], and reference to the previous CT report is recommended for complete description of findings.
KUB [**2196-11-25**]: FINDINGS: In the left anterior mid abdomen in the expected location of the patients known ventral abdominal hernia, multiple air-filled and dilated bowel loops are seen, likely involving both small and large bowel.
Chest Radiograph [**2196-11-26**]: FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is compared with [**11-22**] and [**2196-11-25**].
Diagnostic paracentesis was obtained on [**2196-11-5**] that showed chylous ascites.
Multiple imaging studies failed to show a mass,  however, multiple fluid cytologies were negative, and the patient's LDH was within normal limits making lymphoma quite unlikely.
The second of these revealed a neutrophil count of 280 so led to a second course of five days of antibiotics with ciprofloxacin (as the patient was on cefepime/vanc when the paracentesis occured) which completed on [**2196-11-29**].
All cultures remained negative.
Unfortunately, planning MRI would have been required and given patient's progressively poor respiratory status this would have required intubation.
This was supported by his initial PFT's that showed a restrictive pattern.
By [**11-12**], however, he had reaccumulated almost completely and by [**11-13**] was desaturating again so that an ABG showed of O2 of around 53.
On [**2196-11-29**] a pleurodesis was attempted in hopes of allowing eventual removal of the chest tube though interventional pulmonology thought this had a very low probability of being successful.
However, on the day of expected discharge ([**11-30**]), his respiratory status worsened (oxygen saturation of 90-92% on non-rebreather) and he did not wish to use the mask.
Given that comfort was the goal, he was transitioned back to nasal cannula, and oxygen saturations were no longer followed.
White count failed to trend reliably.
Multiple blood cultures were negative and this seemed stable without mental status changes or end organ dysfunction (except some worsening of his CKD).
10) Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response while his nodal agents were being held.
antibiotics, pleurodesis through a preexisting chest tube) were pursued but other aggressive cares were not.
