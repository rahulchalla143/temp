The patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 3325**] on [**2106-10-18**] with abdominal pain, nausea, and recent diarrhea.
Previous work-up has been unrevealing.
At [**Hospital 26580**] Hospital the patient underwent a CT abdomen that revealed possible pneumatosis of the small bowel (possible focal air in the mesentery adjoining the ileum) though it was a poor quality scan.
Over the last day or so prior to transfer the patient deteriorated with SBPs decreasing from 110s-120s to the 90s and Cr rising from 0.7 to 1.6.
Has 2 children   Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS: T 96.9, BP 100/43, HR 74, RR 18, O2 Sat 96%/RA, weight 110 kg, blood sugar 113 GENERAL: Middle-aged woman in NAD.
EXT: Radial, DP pulses 2+ bilaterally.

Thyroid U/S [**2106-10-21**]: Multinodular goiter with a dominant nodule in the left mid to lower lobe.
KUB [**2106-10-21**]: No evidence of small bowel obstruction.
CT abdomen w/o contrast [**2106-10-25**]: Grossly limited study.
Chest Radiograph [**2106-10-28**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased potentially reflecting improved ventilation.
Over the course of the patient's hospitalization her stool cultures all returned negative and her symptoms began to improve with less pain and nausea so that she could be advanced to a full diet.
Unfortunately, due to a large amount of retained barium from her outside hospital scan, which proved refractory to attempts to clear it with mineral oil, aggressive bowel regimen including docusate, senna, and lactulose, and eventually a GoLytely prep she was unable to be reimaged with CT prior to discharge.
As she had drastically improved regarding her abdominal pain and had no clinical sigsn of periotonitis or fever even after antibiotics were stopped (on [**11-4**]) she was discharged to continue her work-up as an outpatient.
Patient's creatinine improved to 2.8 on [**10-29**] and returned to [**Location 213**] over the following days.
A stat ABG was obtained which showed some hypercarbic respiratory acidosis, and physical exam revealed reactive but pinpoint pupils bilaterally.
She frequently would ask for increases in these doses or decreasing intervals, which were refused secondary to her unimpressive discomfort on exam and the fact her pain did not seem to affect her functioning.
Given history of IVDU hepatitis seriologies were sent given concern for PAN along with complement levels and ANCA were sent.
Hepatitis serologies were all negative and other labs were unimpressive for an autoimmune vasculitis.
You were then transferred to [**Hospital3 **] because your blood pressure was low and your kidney function declined.
We gave you fluids and your blood pressure returned to normal.
