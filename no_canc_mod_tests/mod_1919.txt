Chest tubes were d/c'd [**7-14**] after prolonged airleak that finally sealed.
An EMG was performed which was unable to be completed secondary to patient's refusal to continue.
A plain film of the elbow was obtained which was unchanged per ortho from previous studies.
Pt was sent for a CTA of the right shoulder to assess for obvious vascular or bony pathology as a possible etiology of the pain, but this study revealed no abnormalities.

Further inspection revealed this erythematous area to be directly over the graft site.
US of the left chest showed a loculated collection superior and anterior to the graph site indicating the graft was infected.
