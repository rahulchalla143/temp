CT abdomen: 1.
MRI head:  IMPRESSION: Diffuse cortical atrophy with pronounced cerebellar atrophy.
[**8-1**] Blood Cx (3/4 bottles Positive): AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2201-8-4**]):       STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
CT showed a fractured L rib but no abcess.
He had a MRI due to his hx of sz that showed diffuse cortical and profound cerebellar atrophy without other deficit.
In the meantime, the pt was not treated with abx - vanco was started when his cultures turned positive.
Amylase was normal and lipase slightly elevated at 85.
AST was about 2x ALT.
However, UA and UCx were negative throughout the hospital course.
The patient had no signs of pyelonephritis and CT showed no hydronephrosis nor other kidney changes.
He had an MRI given his history of sz both while drinking and while withdrawing.
The MRI showed only atrophy, particularly in the cerebellum.
Blood cultures were pending for 3 days during which the pt was in the unit.
When blood cultures returned [**1-23**] coag neg staph, he was started on vancomycin.
All blood cx after the [**1-23**] positive ones remained negative.
To better understand the reason for his hyponatremia, urine lytes were sent on admission.
His urine sodium was low, suggesting that he had a dilute urine in the face of hyponatremia.
Hyponatremia was not an issue thereafter.
# dispo: Pt refused alcohol rehab and detox, and was not a PT candidate.
This physician was emailed to make him aware that the pt would be back on the street.
