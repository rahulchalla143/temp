On ROS he denies (and his family concurs) any facial droop, diplopia, blurry vision, dysarthria, word finding or comprehension problems, dysphagia, weakness, numbness, tingling, headache, or bowel or bladder incontinence.
At OSH Head CT was performed and showed an 18 mm midline cerebellar hemorrhage.
INR was checked and was 3.97, and he was given Vitamin K 10 mg PO x 1.
His BPS were 130s-140s there.
On their exam he had a surgical non-reactive pupil on the L, reactive on the R, intact strength and sensation, intact FNF bilaterally, and moderate to severe gait ataxia.

Pertinent Results: CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2131-7-30**] 9:20 PM NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Again demonstrated is a round area of increased attenuation consistent with hemorrhage which appears to displace the fourth ventricle to the right and therefore could be located within the cerebellar vermis.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2131-7-30**] 4:10 PM CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a round area of hyperattenuation consistent with hemorrhage (series 2, image 8) measuring 1.6 x 1.7 cm.
There are multiple calcified granulomas projected over the liver surface which may be diaphragmatic versus hepatic parenchymal.
CTA OF THE THORACIC AORTA: The patient is status post ascending aortic repair with ascending aortic graft visualized.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2131-7-31**] 9:56 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval for extension or hemorrhage or evidence of hydrocephalu  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old man with midline cerebellar hemorrhage in the setting of coumadin use REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for extension or hemorrhage or evidence of hydrocephalus given mass effect on 4th on OSH CT CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: Again demonstrated is a rounded focus of increased attenuation in the midline of the posterior fossa between the cerebral hemispheres, consistent with hemorrhage.
The size is stable measuring 1.6 x 1.7 cm.
There are no dilated small bowel loops or air-fluid levels to suggest small-bowel obstruction.
1) Cerebellar Hemorrhage- The patient was symptomatic for 3 days prior to presentation, and likely had already reached the peak of edema, however there was evidenc by CT for pressure on the 4th ventricle.
His INR was reversed with profiline and vitamin K. Given the location in the posterior fossa and risk of brain stem compression, he was admitted to the Neuro-ICU for observation and started on mannitol diuresis.
Repeat head CT revealed stable size of hemorrhage without significant mass effect.
His blood pressure was tightly managed on his home regimen in combination with a labetalol gtt.
His neurologic examination remained stable in combination with stable head CT. His gait ataxia persists necessitating acute rehab placement.
CTA revealed 1cm worsening of pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the ascending aorta with the graft.
His abdominal xray was without signs of bowel obstruction.
Further evaluation may continue at rehab should symptoms persist.
Urine osmolality was followed while on Mannitol.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
You should have an MRI as an outpatient to evaluate this area in a few weeks.
