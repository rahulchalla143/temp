Her tylenol level on presentation was 10, her ALT was 1117, AST 821.
Her INR was slightly elevated at 1.2.
Her NAC drip was continued until her acetaminophen level was undetectable, her INR decreased to 0.9, and her transaminases continued to trend downward, suggesting that she was unlikely to suffer further liver injury.
She will follow up with her dentist for further pain control and evaluation of the tooth pain as needed.
Her urine culture grew only commensal flora.
Your liver seems to be recovering but we will need to follow your liver tests over the next few weeks.
Followup Instructions: You need to have labs drawn at [**Hospital3 **] on Wednesday.
