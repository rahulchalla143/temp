Hepatitis B surface antigen negative.
Apgar scores were 8 at one minute and 8 again at five minutes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination at the time of admission was consistent with gestational age of 32 weeks.
Her birth weight was 2100 grams in the 90th percentile.
Her length was 45 cm, 75 to 90th percentile and her head circumference was 31 cm, 75 to 90th percentile.
Heart rate 164; respiratory rate 60 to 70; temperature 98.3; blood pressure 71/35 with a mean of 52.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anterior fontanel soft and flat, non dysmorphic, normocephalic, intact palate, mild nasal flaring.
Respiratory rate initially was notable for tachypnea with respiratory rate in the 80's which resolved over the first few days of life; now is in the normal range with comfortable breathing pattern.
Cardiovascular:  Initially, baby required one normal saline bolus for mean blood pressures in the mid 30's.
No medications were required for blood pressure support.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Initially, the baby was placed on intravenous fluids of D-10-W.  She required one D- 10-W bolus for a dextrose stick of 29.
A repeat tyrosine level was requested by the state laboratory and that, too, came back elevated.
Additional laboratory studies were obtained to determine whether this was tyrosinemia type I, type II or type III.
Additional laboratory studies obtained were liver function tests, coagulation studies, serum ammonia, serum amino acids, urine organic acids and urine succinyl acetone.
The urine succinyl acetone was sent to [**Hospital1 56915**] and that study was negative.
A repeat tyrosine level was obtained on [**2110-9-18**] and that result is pending.
The tyrosine levels have gradually decreased with serial levels.
The liver function tests were normal.
BUN of 12; creatinine of .4; ALT of 6; AST of 16; alkaline phosphatase of 220.
PT and PTT were also noted to be in the normal range.
Arterial blood gas did not reveal acidosis.
She resumed full enteral feeds after the negative urine succinyl acetone study was obtained on day of life 16.
Gastrointestinal:  Baby had physiologic jaundice and received phototherapy from day two with a peak serum bilirubin of 11.2 over 0.3 on day of life three.
Phototherapy was discontinued on day five, with a rebound bilirubin of 9.7 over 0.3.
On [**9-17**] and [**9-18**], a serum bilirubin was obtained for clinical jaundice and was found to be 12.4 over 0.3, likely representing breast milk jaundice at this time.
Hematology:  Baby had an initial CBC drawn upon admission to the newborn Intensive Care Unit, revealing a white count of 11.3 with 15 polys and 0 bands; hematocrit 48.4 percent and platelets of 203,000.
Infectious disease:  Blood culture was also obtained upon admission and infant received 48 hours of Ampicillin and Gentamycin, which were discontinued 48 hours after negative cultures and an improved clinical course.
Neurology:  Screening head ultrasound was obtained on day of life 11, which was reported to be a normal study by the radiologist at [**Hospital3 1810**].
Ophthalmology:  A retinopathy screen was performed on [**9-15**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and revealed immature retina to zone three.
CAR SEAT POSITION SCREENING:  Performed prior to discharge and baby passed.
Follow-up ophthalmology examination with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in mid [**9-29**].
Prematurity at 31 and 4/7 weeks.
