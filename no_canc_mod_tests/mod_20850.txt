IMPRESSION: Study limited by patient motion, but no acute intracranial process detected.
CXR: PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: There are low lung volumes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2105-8-22**] the inferior T wave changes have improved which may represent pseudonormalization in the context of the increase in rate.
Thiamine, folate, and multivitamin were given.
