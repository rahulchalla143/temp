[**2121-12-1**] CXR (port AP) - Low lung volumes, but no focal consolidations.
[**2121-12-1**] NCHCT - Suboptimal exam due to patient motion.
[**2121-12-1**] CXR (port AP) - No pneumothorax is identified.
[**2121-12-2**] TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-7-2**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased while the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased.
[**2121-12-2**] ECG - Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-12-1**] there is no diagnostic interim change.
[**2121-12-4**] CXR (port AP) - low lung volumes which is unchanged.
[**2121-12-5**] Cardiac catheterization (right heart) COMMENTS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling pressures with RVEDP 13mmHg and mildly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure with PCWP 14mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.4 L/min/m2.
[**2121-12-5**] ECG Sinus rhythm.
Q-T interval prolongation and slowing of the rate as compared with prior tracing of [**2121-12-4**].
[**2121-12-5**] Chest x-ray IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-4**]: There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion or mediastinal widening.
[**2121-12-5**] US vein study FINDINGS: Focus color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] evaluation of bilateral subclavian and internal jugular veins demonstrated normal flow and compressibility.
Monitor mental status exam - Abd US with Doppler: Cirrhotic liver, ascites, gallstone, reverse flow in her splenic vein (some type of shunt), portal vein is patent.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-7-2**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased while the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased.
EKG with Sinus Tachycardia.
Did not increase overnight, but would consider this in the a.m. - Sustained SVT at 115 later with maintained pressures, SBP ~ 100s.
Distinct from runs of VT. - EKG 115 bmp, Normal intervals and axis.
- Very dry on physical exam with flat JVP, dry mouth and thirsty.
There was no clear precipitating factor - diagnostic tap was negative for SBP, no evidence of GIB, per husband patient had been medication-compliant and was having 3 bowel movements daily.
However, echocardiogram raised concern for possible pulmonary hypertension that could represent a contraindication to [**Month/Day (3) **].
Mean pulmonary artery pressure was 23 mmHg, compatible with [**Last Name (un) **].
Repeat CXR showed no evidence of worsening infiltrate.
Patient underwent an ultrasound study which showed patent vessels.
Patient was treated with ceftriaxone for a possible UTI, but culture showed no growth, so this medication was discontinued.
She was clinically volume-overloaded, with abdominal exam pertinent for full but not tense abdomen.
Her MELD score remained in the low 30s throughout this admission.
Aranesp (Polysorbate) 300 mcg/mL Solution [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) injection Injection QHD (on hemodialysis days).
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Hepatic encephalopathy - Cirrhosis of the liver secondary to hepatitis C virus  Secondary: - Diabetes mellitus type II - End stage renal disease, on hemodialysis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] with confusion.
You were taken for a cardiac catheterization procedure to make sure that the vessels supplying blood to your lungs are healthy enough for you to undergo a [**Hospital1 **] surgery - it appears that they are.
