IMAGING: CT Head ([**5-15**]): IMPRESSION: Relative hypodensity with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the left occipital region and right cerebellum concerning for infarcts of indeterminate age, acute versus subacute.
An MRI is recommended for further characterization.
CXR ([**5-15**]): IMPRESSION: ET tube 4.6 cm above the carina.
TTE ([**5-16**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
CTA Head/Neck ([**5-16**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR ([**5-17**]): Tip of the new Dobbhoff feeding tube, with a wire stylet in place ends in the upper stomach alongside a nasogastric tube.
CXR ([**5-18**]): The ET tube tip is relatively low, approximately 3 cm above the carina, but the patient's neck is in mild flexion, thus the position of the ET tube is at the lower limits of accepted.
Rapidly progressing infection is another possibility, although is less likely given its absence on the chest radiograph from [**2140-5-17**], obtained at 8:09 p.m.
Right basal opacity has improved since the most recent prior study consistent with partial resolution of aspiration with still present minimal atelectasis.
CT Head ([**5-18**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head ([**5-25**]): IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of acute intracranial process compared to prior study.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
TTE showed no evidence of thrombus.
He was started on a heparin gtt with goal PTT 50-70.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.
Sputum culture showed rare growth gram negative rods.
CXR was done which revealed a Left PNA.
FLP showed Chol 230, LDL 151, TG 142, and HDL 51, and his Simvastatin was increased to 80 mg qhs.
Patient was re-intubated, heparin gtt was discontinued, and STAT Head CT was completed which showed severe hydrocephalus secondary to posterior right SCA stroke edematous evolution and compromise of his 4th ventricle, (diameter of 5.9 mm as compared to 13mm) on [**2140-5-15**].
Repeat post-EVD Head CT showed reduced hydrocephalus.
On [**5-24**], the heparin gtt was restarted, for a goal PTT 50-70.
Coumadin 5 mg daily was started on [**5-25**], for a goal INR [**2-23**].
Hypercoaguable work up was pending at the time of discharge, but did include Factor V Leiden, Protein C and S, and anticardiolipin Ab.
Subsequent TEE did not show any evidence of intracardiac thrombus.
Heparin (Porcine) in D5W 25,000 unit/250 mL Parenteral Solution Sig: Nine [**Age over 90 1230**]y (950) units/hour Intravenous drip: Goal PTT 50-70, can check PTT q12 hours if therapeutic.
HydrALAzine 10 mg IV Q6H:PRN SBP > 180 or MAP > 110 Please keep SBP 120-180 6.
HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 0.25-1 mg IV Q3H:PRN pain 14.
You had echocardiograms done which did not show a cardiac source of a clot.
You were started on heparin drip (goal PTT 50-70) for a bridge to Coumadin 5 mg daily (goal INR [**2-23**]).
