RLE Cellulitis: Hematogenous source of recurrent cellulitis not apparent as blood cultures were negative.
The patient was prescribed Clotrimazole cream to address the issues of Tinea Pedis to try to prevent future episodes of cellulitis.
Acute renal failure: The patient presented with a Cr of 1.3 from a baseline of 0.8, which was likely pre-renal azotemia due to dehydration.
