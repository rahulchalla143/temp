Cardiology was consulted and his rate and BP were controlled with a panoply of pharmacological agents, which were eventually titrated to an oral regimen that could be administered on the general floor.
Once transferred to the general floor, he remained afebrile and his BP and HR remained well controlled.
His lipid panel was elevated and so his dose of home pravastatin was increased.
His neurological exam on discharge was notable for ongoing disorientation, mild right NLF flattening, moving all ext antigravity, though probably with some weakness R > L, upgoing toes bilaterally, and able to transfer from bed to chair with max assist, but unable to functionally ambulate.
