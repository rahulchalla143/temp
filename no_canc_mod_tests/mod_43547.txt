She has not had fever, chills, URI symptoms, abdominal pain, sick contacts, recent antibiotics (other than PO vanco) or recent travel.
weight gain and has felt more lethargic, reportedly similar to how she has during past episodes of fluid retention.
She was seen in cardiology clinic the day prior to admission, at which time routine labs revealed BUN 38/Cr 2.1/K 5.9.
In the ED, initially afebrile HR 83 BP 100/48 RR 20 O2sat 96% RA 100% 4LNC.
K+ peaked at 6.9 (D50 & insulin given) f/b 5.2.
WBC 11.3 with 83% PMNs, no bands.
Lactate 5.5 f/b 4.1.
INR 3.4.
SBP never dropped below 100, MAP ranged 55-78, with HR 50's-70's.
CVP ranged 6-11 cmH20, ScvO2 65-78.
CXR revealed bilat effusions R>L and cephalization c/w CHF.
Abd/pelvis CT w/o contrast preliminarily showed intraperitoneal free fluid and colonic wall thickening predominantly on the right c/w third-spacing or infectious colitis.
In the ICU, patient had a TTE which showed worsening of her EF to 15%, pulmonary hypertension, and severe aortic stenosis.

CT ABD/PELVIS w/o contrast (prelim) - large right pleural effusion and small left effusion with right lower lobe opacity could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia; intraperitoneal free fluid and colonic wall thickening predominantly on the right, could reflect third spacing other differential includes infectious colitis, including C diff.
Study not equipped for evaluation of bowel ischemia due to lack of IV contrast which remains in the differential .
TTE [**7-5**] - The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-9-21**], overall LV systolic function may be slightly worse.
- Goal UOP >20-30 cc/h - Holding K - Continue Lasix 40 mg PO BID - Begin Metolazone 2.5 mg daily .
#Acute on chronic systolic heart failure - TTE revealed worsened valve and LV function c/w exam [**9-24**]; substantial pleural effusions but no respiratory compromise.
CEs negative, ECG unchanged, no new findings on TTE so unlikely recent ischemic event precipiated this decompensation.
- Continue BB and [**Last Name (un) **], Lasix, and Metolazone - Titrate O2 to maintain sat >92%.
#N/V/D - suspect viral etiology as has not had vomiting with prior episodes of c. diff; no c/o pain, benign abdominal exam, and supratherapeutic INR makes ischemia/thrombosis less likely; lactate trending down.
#Anemia - Hct 32, b/l ~38; no s/sx bleeding but GI tract most likely source; has polyps on prior colonoscopies; on Fe replacement for chronic anemia, likely element of ACD as well.
Hct today was 27.1.
- Transfuse for Hct <21% - Monitor daily Hct - Guiac stools  \, on d.c, guiac negative, h/h has significant lab variation, no clincal problems .
#DM - -[**12-21**] basal insulin + RISS while NPO, f/b full dose NPH when eating .
#CAD - no ischemic changes on EKG and negative troponins x3 -cont.
#F/E/N-slightly better PO intake - Cardiac diet, with supplements - Monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **] - Encourage PO entake.
#PPx - PPI, INR ok, supratheraputic heparin, D/c'ed , no need for bowel regimen .
