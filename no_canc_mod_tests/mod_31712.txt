Initially thought to be regular, but on further review of the EKGs from the ED, it seems that patient has been having irregular borderline narrow complex tachycardia, which is more consistent with atrial fibrillation.
TSH was only mildly elevated in [**Month (only) **], making hyperthyroidism less likely the cause of the AF.
Clinical exam and CXR do not suggest significant volume overload or infectious etiology.
A renal biopsy in [**3-/2154**] was positive for amyloidosis.
