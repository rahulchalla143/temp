Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2116-10-6**]):       PROTEUS MIRABILIS.

FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2116-10-11**]):       REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ 1140A, [**2116-10-8**].

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2116-9-30**] at 12:05:19 PM FINAL Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2116-9-30**] 12:59 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
Postoperative change and fluid within the abdomen that is nonspecific with no dilated loops of small or large bowel.
The fluid collection appears increased since CT from [**2116-9-4**].
EGD [**2116-10-6**]: Impression: Erythema and congestion in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis Retained fluids in stomach Bilious fluid was seen in the stomach and duodenum.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: The findings do not account for the symptoms Will discuss with team re: small intestinal evaluation for source of bleeding (capsule vs tagged RBC scan vs CT Angiography).
Brief Hospital Course: A 44 year-old man with a history of paraplegia and ESRD with tunnelled HD line presents with fevers and positive blood cultures from HD.
His cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] show blood culture positive for Proteus on [**9-29**], catheter tip culture positive for MRSA on [**9-30**], and wound culture positive for MRSA on [**9-30**].
Once blood cultures cleared a permanent tunnel line later placed.
Drainage of fluid collection around left acetabulum: Infectious disease was consulted and felt that the pt's collection in his left hip was increased from prior CT and recommended sampling and drainage as this was also another likely source of infection/bacteremia.
Because the pt became unstable, drainage and full washout was delayed initially but aspiration culture showed pseudomonas.
After he was stablized (see GI bleed section below) he went to OR w/ortho on [**10-11**] and is s/p washout and drain placement [**10-11**]).
His endoscopy showed gastritis but there was concern for possible bleed at anastomosis site.
HCT were monitored and remained stable.
HCT at time of discharge: 25.8.
Iron studies reflective of anemia of chronic disease.
# SVC DVT: SVC clot was seen on a non-contrast CT on prelim read.
Survellance blood cultures were taken to determine when it as safe for preminent line placement (temp line was placed for HD in the meantime).
INR at time of discharge: 2.7.
# Hypotension: Per notes at rehab and review of records from recent admission here, baseline SBP has been running high 70s to 90s.
Your blood counts were monitored closely and they were found to be stable.
Cultures showed that this collection was growing Pseudomonas which appeared to be sensitive to the antibiotics you were on.
After your blood cultures remained negative for a number of days, it was determined safe to replace your dialysis line.
You will need to have your INR monitored at rehab and at home.
You will need to have your INR checked as well as labs to monitor the treatment of your infection.
