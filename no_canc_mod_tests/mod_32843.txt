Current study reveals no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum within the limitations of this portable AP radiograph.
CXR As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
Her chest pain was evaluated with ECG and troponins which were negative for ischemic.
She had a LENI for calf pain which was negative for DVT.
She was transitioned to a po prednisone taper regimen and repeat bedside spirometry showed improvement in her respiratory function.
Psychosocial triggers believed to be a significant contributor to vocal cord malfunction and episodes of dyspnea.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - no labs pending at time of discharge - Follow up for PVFM evaluation and respiratory retraining - Follow up with interventional pulmonology as scheduled - patient full code during admission   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
