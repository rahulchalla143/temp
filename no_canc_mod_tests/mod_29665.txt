His symptoms progressed and he began to have dyspnea with minimal DOE.
An echo was obtained which showed EF 55%, mod to severe AI and elevated pulm pressures.
Wedge was 34, pa systolic pressure 90, aortic pressure 200s, aortagram with 3+ AI.
Past Medical History: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension   Social History: - works as manager for security/ EMS service for ALF - lives with his wife.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ tibial edema, 1+ edema to bilateral hips.

Radiology: Cardiac Cath ([**2-24**]) - Preliminary Report COMMENTS: 1.
Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system demonstrated two vessel and branch vessel coronary artery disease.
Ascending aortography demonstrated severe aortic insufficiency with retograde filling of the left ventricle within two heart beats.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severly elevated left ventricular filling pressures, with an LVEDP of 38 mmHg.
There was also severly elevated pulmonary hypertension, with a PASP of 77mmHg.
Cardiac index was preserved, with a CI of 2.5 L/min/m2.
PCXR ([**2-24**]): IMPRESSION: Pulmonary venous hypertension.
ECHO ([**2-25**]): Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Chest CTA ([**2-25**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unknown origin.
Discharge Labs ([**2-26**]): [**2158-2-26**] 01:20PM BLOOD WBC-8.2 RBC-5.36 Hgb-14.5 Hct-45.1 MCV-84 MCH-27.0 MCHC-32.1 RDW-14.6 Plt Ct-278 Chemistry: pending  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year-old man with a PMH of hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents with 2-3 weeks of progressive shortness of breath, signs and symptoms of CHF found to have severe aortic regurgitation on echocardiogram and right upper lobe pulmonary embolism on CT angiogram.
# CHF with aortic insufficiency: Patient had no history of valve abnormality and the eitology was further evaluated with 3D echocardiogram that revealed a tri-leaflet valve and an LVEF of 42%.
Preexising CHF may have caused aortic annulus dilation worsening the AI and AI was likely contributing to worsened heart failure.
Pt was started on metoprolol 50mg TID to control heart rate and kept on home losartan for BP control.
Severe elevation in LV pressure was somewhat more consistent with fairly acute regurgitation to which the heart had not yet had a chance to compensate vs fairly old AI with new cardiac decompensation and inability to maintain ventricular emptying in setting of AI.
Pt quickly stabilized and both BP and oxygenation normalilzed and decision was made to send home on low dose of PO lasix in order to help remove the small amount of extra fluid that was still on board.
Lipid panel showed HDL 32 with LDL 70.
# HTN: patient admitted with severe HTN with SBP to 200s.
His blood pressure was gradually lowered using a nitro drip and uptitrating metoprolol until reached acceptable levels.
# HLD: Lipid panel showed acceptable control of LDL and somewhat low HDL.
You were STARTED on Lovenox 100mg injected twice daily - you will take this medication until your INR is checked at your appointment on Tuesday.
Followup Instructions: Please see your cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**First Name (STitle) **], on Tuesday [**2-28**] to get your INR checked, which is used to monitor coumadin dosing.
