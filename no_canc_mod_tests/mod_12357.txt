Patient was then medflighted to [**Hospital6 256**] for emergent catheterization due to persistent chest pain and ST elevation.
Cardiac catheterization findings were 50% mid left anterior descending stenosis, proximal right coronary artery occlusion, increased right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute, ST elevation in II, greater than 4 mm, III greater than 8 mm and aVF greater than 6 mm with reciprocal changes in the lateral leads and ST depression in V2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 127.
Blood pressure 135/89.
Saturation 100% on ventilator.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No jugular venous distention.
Sodium 129, potassium 3.5, chloride 97, glucose 201, hemoglobin 13.1, hematocrit 39, lactate was 2.0.
Cardiac catheterization at this hospital showed focal basal right ventricular wall hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 40-45%.
Patient had a repeat echocardiogram which showed ejection fraction of 40% with focal hypokinesis of the right ventricular free wall inferior lateral left ventricular, as well as trivial myocardial infarction.
Sputum was sent off for Gram stain, which was positive for gram positive cocci in clusters and gram negative rods.
