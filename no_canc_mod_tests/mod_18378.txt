In the ED, his initial vs were: T 97.3 P 80 BP 152/91 O2 sat 97 % on RA RR 16.
There was concern that he had progression of his bleed and CT scan was repeated which showed evolution of hemorrhage with stable edema, no midline shift and no new intra or extra- axial hemorrhage or infarct.
Neurosurg was initially consulted but given no new changes on CT did not feel it was necessary to admit him to neuro ICU.
On admission to the ICU, his initial VS were BP 152/71, HR 69, O2 98% on 3 liters R 21.

Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
The right kidney measures 10.3 cm and the left kidney measures 12.0 cm.
Cross-sectional assessment of this ectatic area demonstrates measurements of 4.2 x 3.9 cm.
These changes are relatively unchanged compared to prior study and could be related to age-associated involutary changes.
ECHO (TTE): Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
With fluid restriction the Na levels normalized and no narcotics or sedatives were used.
The sodium levels will need to be monitored closely.
CT head did not show worsening ICH.
INR will require close monitoring at rehab.
Target INR is between 2 and 3.
CT head repeated and again no new events were seen.
No ekg changes or head CT changes to suggest hypertensive emergency.
Ultiimately, his sodium corrected with fluid restriction.
Abdominal U/S was done and was negative for hepatobiliary process as above.
He had hepatitis panel sent which was negative.
Orthostatic hypotension - transiently noted and resolved with stopping lisinopril.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm - should be followed up with PCP for follow up imaging.
repeat UA with no RBCs.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day).
Sodium levels will require monitoring at rehab.
You will need the INR levels to be closely monitored while at rehab and thereafter to follow up with your doctor to have your blood level monitored.
You also need follow up urine tests to make sure no blood is noted in urine.
Also, a follow up CT abdomen is recommended with your primary doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 32942**] the abdominal aortic aneurysm.
You will need to have your INR level checked (goal [**1-12**]).
You should also discuss further management of your abdominal aortic aneurysm and blood in urine.
