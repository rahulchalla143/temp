A KUB showed moderate gastric distention.
His diet was advanced to clears and a chest xray showed resolution of the pneumothorax.
[**12-27**]: increased pain regimen [**12-29**]: tolerated a regular diet [**1-2**]: The patient had a voiding cystogram which was normal, with no evidence of contrast extravasation.
You need a repeat cystogram at that time, and the urologists will determine whether the catheter can be removed at that time.
