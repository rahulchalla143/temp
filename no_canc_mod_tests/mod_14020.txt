[**2163-4-27**]: CT abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1) Stable appearance of extensive peripancreatic inflammation and stable extent of nonenhancing regions within the pancreas (although these regions are better seen on today's exam due to differences in phase of contrast).
An insulin drip was necessary for glucose control His respiratory decompensation was suggestive of an ARDS-like picture.
On [**4-21**], an esophageal balloon was placed as part of an ARDS protocol for ventilation.
However, he continued to be febrile, and on [**4-24**] and [**4-25**], blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci, which later speciated to coagulase negative staph.
His antibiotics were changed to linezolid, and the flagyl was discontinued because cultures were negative for c diff.
