Upon arrival, he was extricated from underneath the truck; and while in transport, he had an episode of desaturation with a decrease in blood pressure, for which he was intubated.
His initial examination revealed bilateral pneumothoraces for which bilateral chest tubes were placed.
His secondary survey revealed mild abdominal tenderness, but no other gross abnormalities.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Initial physical examination with a blood pressure of 104/71, heart rate of 125, respirations intubated at 24, oxygen saturation of 96%.
Rectal examination was heme-negative.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A CAT scan of his head revealed mild effacement of the gyri consistent with mild edema.
A CAT scan of his chest with intravenous contrast showed no injury to the great vessels.
A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a small 3-cm X 2-cm posterior liver laceration with no free fluid in the abdomen.
A CT of the pelvis revealed a nondisplaced femoral fracture.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
He was placed on assist-control ventilation; however, his oxygen saturations and PAO2 were inadequate, and he was switched to pressure-control ventilation as he progressed to an acute respiratory distress syndrome picture.
He was transfused with fresh frozen plasma to correct a mild coagulopathy and was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for a slight hematocrit drop to 27 initially with an adequate response to a hematocrit of 36 afterwards.
The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed to monitor hemodynamic status, and he had a high central venous pressures and pulmonary arterial pressures; indicating that the patient was not hypovolemic.
The patient had an echocardiogram to evaluate for evidence of blunt myocardial injury, gross wall motion abnormalities, or valvular defects.
The echocardiogram showed normal overall wall motion and ejection fraction, and no pericardial effusion.
The patient's pulmonary status was such that he was requiring increasing levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and 100% FIO2 to maintain adequate oxygenation while his PCO2 were rising as well; and this was felt to be secondary to a very severe air dehiscent pulmonary contusions.
Plain films of the patient's bilateral upper extremities revealed no fractures, and a repeat chest x-ray showed no change in his prior x-rays of bilateral long whiteout, but no gross pneumothorax with chest tube in good position.
The sputum cultures began growing out hemophilus influenza for which the patient was started on levofloxacin with slight defervescence of his fever.
This initially showed an intracranial pressure of 27.
Once his PCO2 came down to the low 50s, the intracranial pressure dropped to a normal level of 12, and the intracranial pressure monitor was discontinued.
The cerebral perfusion pressure throughout was maintained greater than 60.
The patient revealed intermittent boluses of albumin for an elevated heart rate and decreased urine output despite high right-sided filling pressures with good response.
The patient also had a thoracic, lumbar, and cervical spinal x-rays which revealed no fractures.
By hospital day seven, the patient began to stabilize and his intracranial pressure monitor had been discontinued and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation had been discontinued.
At this time, the patient began having a sputum that grew gram-positive cocci which was eventually identified as methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, for which he was started on oxacillin in addition to the levofloxacin that he was on for his hemophilus influenza.
After this, the patient continued to spike low-grade fevers but was thought to be adequately covered for antibiotics, as no other culture data grew out any additional organisms.
His room air saturation was 96% to 97%, and his respirations were unlabored at 18 to 20.
