MRA of head and neck [**1-29**]: Nonvisualization of the right vertebral artery could be due to thrombosis.
EEG [**1-30**]:  This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of bursts of generalized slowing superimposed upon a slow background.

CT head reported as negative at the outside hospital; however, official report not available.
An MRI on [**2-2**] showed multiple new small emolizations and again a poorly visualized vertebral artery.
- Carotid U/S showed < 40% stenosis of both carotids.
