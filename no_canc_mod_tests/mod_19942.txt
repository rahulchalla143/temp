PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained [**2170-2-24**] at 0906 hours and are compared with the prior study performed on [**2170-2-22**] 1310 hours.
Patchy increase in density is seen in the right base, likely in the right lower lobe, which was not present on the prior examination and may represent some developing airspace disease.
The examination is otherwise unchanged from the prior study.
Increased retrocardiac density are not significantly changed since prior examination and likely representing subsegmental atelectasis.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient =12 mmHg, peak gradient = 16mmHg with CO 5.1L/min).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
