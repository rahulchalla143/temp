SINGLE SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The lung volumes are slightly low, but there are no focal airspace consolidations, pneumothorax or pleural effusions.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-8-2**], the cardiac findings are similar (ascites and left pleural effusion are now seen).
Renal u/s 1.
Unremarkable Doppler examination of the kidneys, with no findings to suggest renal artery stenosis .

Chest AP portable [**1-7**]: Endotracheal tube has been advanced, now terminating in standard placement approximately 3 cm above the carina.
His BP has worsened and he became agitated off of sedation.
EGD showed portal hypertensive gastropathy with active bleeding, and fungating mass in antrum of stomach.
Urine lytes were obtained in ED, however pt is chronically on lasix so FeNa calculation would not be accurate.
FeUrea is 16.6% on admission, which would be consistent w/ pre-renal azotemia.
Renal team was consulted, and microscopic analysis suggested ATN as etiology of anuric renal failure.
DJD of hip: stable .
