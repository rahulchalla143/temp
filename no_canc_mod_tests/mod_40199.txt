He mentioned some of his symptoms at [**Hospital1 2286**] but it is not clear if anything such as blood cultures were done at that time.

[**9-22**] CXR: FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from [**2148-9-17**].
There is a very large right-sided pleural effusion, which is partially loculated along the right lateral chest wall, which is unchanged from the prior study.
The right side down decubitus view demonstrates some layering of the fluid; however, a LEFT side down decubitus view would be best for evaluation of the pleural fluid.
Intraluminal jejunal contrast from previous study is noted.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-8-21**], mitral regurgitation is now more prominent and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
Chest xray, [**2148-9-17**]: Right-sided pleural thickening and subpleural atelectasis are chronic since at least [**2147-12-28**].
MRI Spine, [**2148-9-14**]: Limited study secondary to motion.
Small thickened fold was seen with some erythema in the body of the stomach Whitish exudate was seen in the esophagus Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: PPI Repeat EGD with biopsy of the esophageal nodule when INR is lower Follow Hct   Brief Hospital Course: .
Blood cxs revealed [**4-30**] Coag Neg Staph with antibiotics were narrowed to Vancomycin QHD.
A Cortisol stim test was performed to evaluate for adrenal insufficiency and the patient did not respond appropriately.
Gent was stopped when [**4-30**] blood cxs grew Coag neg Staph.
Blood cultures from [**Date range (1) 79555**] have been negative.
No further cultures were drawn.
A KUB showed no abdominal pathology.
Amylase was elevated but his lipase was WNL.
The patient had a previous EGD which showed Barrets esophagus.
The patient was advised to have the biopsy done this admission and the risks of delaying the procedure were explained to him.
Because he had had an extensive hospitalization, he declined and preferred to be readmitted for reversal of his INR in about 4 weeks.
A gastric emptying study should be scheduled as an outpatient.
The most recent CXR showed a worsened loculated effusion.
As the patient was felt to be only minimally symptomatic with occasional SOB, it was decided that tapping the fluid would be of minimal utility and was not done.
Amyloidosis on echo: Cardiology was consulted and no biopsy was recommended.
Endocrine: a) DM II: The patient had his BS tested qid.
The sliding scale was adjusted down secondary to episodes of hypoglycemia and decreased PO intake from vomiting.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable in the 90's upon cessation of the hydrocortisone.
He had a subtherapeutic INR secondary to holding coumadin for replacement of the femoral line.
Upon discharge, the patient was advised to hold his coumadin for two nights and then have his INR checked at [**Last Name (un) 2286**] on the third day.
The patient's outpatient [**Last Name (un) 2286**] center was informed of the need for his nephrologist to redose his coumadin based on his INR at his next [**Last Name (un) 2286**] appointment.
His phosphate binders were held while his phosphate was low.
)(s)* Refills:*2* 10. coumadin Please do not take coumadin on thursday and friday evening [**9-26**] and [**9-27**].
Your INR will be sent to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] by the [**First Name (STitle) 2286**] staff on saturday and he will re-dose your coumadin.
You will need to return to the hospital for a biopsy of the esophagus.
You will be seen by one of your renal doctors at [**Name5 (PTitle) 2286**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] have your INR checked at that time and your coumadin dosed.
