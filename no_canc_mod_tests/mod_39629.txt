She had a TTE with EF 55 and mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], chest CTA neg for PE but with compression fracture of thoracic spine.
Her coumadin was held but given yesterday so vit K PO given this AM with last INR of 1.42.
Complete 13 point ROS is negative except for the above items.
Pertinent Results: OSH studies significant for #Chest CTA no PE but with multiple chronic-appearing thoracic compression fractures --need f/u of L kidney masses?

EKG [**2196-8-28**] at [**Hospital1 18**] during episode of [**11-7**] CP: Poor study.
Afib rate 96, NA, normal QRS and QT intervals.
EKG [**2196-8-29**] at [**Hospital1 18**] when STD seen on telemetry: A-fib rate 72, NA, normal QRS and QT intervals.
#COPD:  The patient has a high O2 requirement at home (4.5L NC), and initial evaluation for procedure was concerning for respiratory function.
EKG [**8-28**] was largely stable from prior at [**Hospital3 **], both of which showed diffuse downsloping ST elevations consistent with digitalis effect.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x3.
A f/u EKG on [**2196-8-29**] was again consistent with digitalis effect.

During the ERCP procedure, sphincter stenosis (narrowing) was found, which was likely the cause of or liver function abnormalities.
A sphincterotomy was performed to treat that narrowing, and your liver tests improved thereafter.
3) Discuss whether you need to be taking antibiotics to prevent pneumonia given that you have been on steroids as an outpatient (bactrim would be the most likely antibiotic).
