[**2-10**] CXR: Limited study as above.
Apparent left femur fracture due to immobilization device which limits evaluation of the pelvis as above.
Compared with the recent study of [**2146-1-31**].
TTE: Moderate pulmonary hypertension with mildly dilated and hypokinetic RV as well as moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation.
CTA Chest [**2-13**]:IMPRESSION: 1.
UA on day of discharge negative, urine culture negative.
Will continue ppx Lovenox 40mg SC daily until INR reaches 2.0-2.5 on coumadin.
# Hypotension: Resolved, present in post-operative period in setting of blood loss during [**Month/Year (2) 24785**] on [**2-12**].
CTA was negative for PE and TTE showed RV hypokinesis suggesting that she may be more volume responsive.
Eventually the pressors were weaned off with IVF boluses and her home anti-hypertensives were reinitiated.
Pt was initially w/supratherapeutic INR at time of admission; coumadin was held and reversed in setting of pre-op period and dropping hct, which was likely due to bleeding at site of fracture.
Lovenox 40mg SQ daily should be continued for DVT ppx until INR at goal of 2.0-2.5 x 48 hours per orthopedic surgery.
CTA was negative for PE.
Hemolysis labs were unremarkable.
8. enoxaparin 40 mg/0.4 mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Subcutaneous DAILY (Daily): Please d/c once INR between 2-2.5 for 48 hours.
Please have your INR checked daily; your coumadin was held at first as your INR was too high.
It is being restarted at a lower dose; the dosage may be changed to reach a goal INR of 2 to 2.5 for your atrial fibrillation.
Please make the following changes to your medications: - INCREASE sotolal to 80mg by mouth twice a day for your heart rate - START Lovenox (enoxaparin) 40mg injection once a day to prevent blood clots until your INR is between 2 and 2.5 - START vitamin D and calcium to strengthen your bones .
