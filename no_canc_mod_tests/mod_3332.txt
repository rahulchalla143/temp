She had a recent admission approximately 10 days ago at an outside hospital for hypercarbic respiratory failure with increased troponins at that time.
On the day of admission she was found to be somnolent by Emergency Medical Service with a respiratory rate of 8, and a fingerstick in the 250s.
She was brought to [**Hospital3 **] where an arterial blood gas showed 7.19/73/32.
She was intubated with rapid improvement in her arterial blood gas, but her systolic blood pressure subsequently dropped into the 50s and she was started on a dopamine drip.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] with her dopamine drip partially weaned, and her systolic blood pressure in the 120s.
Her chest x-ray in the Emergency Department showed bibasilar consolidations.
A CT angiogram showed bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation with air bronchograms and numerous mediastinal lymph nodes.
Given the results of the CT angiogram and the fact that the patient subsequently spiked to a temperature of 103, she was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole.
Her troponin came back at 26.2.
She maintained her blood pressure, overnight on the night after admission, as the dopamine drip was weaned off.
[**2200-3-25**] cardiac catheterization showed a patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and occluded saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery, a 40% stenosis in the right internal mammary artery to right coronary artery, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 26, and occluded left main coronary artery, a proximally occluded right coronary artery, 50% mid stenosis of the circumflex, and a 100% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  At the time of the examination in the Intensive Care Unit she was afebrile.
Her blood pressure and heart rate were stable and within normal limits, off cardiac medications except for the atenolol.
Lungs had bibasilar crackles, dullness to percussion at the bases.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On the day of admission white blood cell count was 12.1 (with 79% neutrophils and 16% lymphocytes), hematocrit of 34.9, platelets of 196.
Electrolytes were within normal limits.
PT and PTT were within normal limits.
Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection.
Creatine kinases were 2108, 1708, and 1277.
CK/MB were 49, 31, and 16.
MB index was 2.3, 1.8, and 1.3.
Troponin I was 26.2 and 21.7.
On the day after admission, white blood cell count was 9.5, hematocrit 30.3, platelets 188.
Electrolytes were within normal limits.
AST 117, ALT 40, alkaline phosphatase 149, total bilirubin of 0.6, amylase 149, lipase 27, albumin 2.7.
Calcium 7.7.
A post extubation arterial blood gas was 7.35/45/93.
Sputum culture from the date of admission had greater than 25 neutrophils, less than 10 epithelial cells, with 1+ multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
Blood cultures times four and urine culture times one showed no growth.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 82 beats per minute.
CT angiogram showed numerous mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest 1.2 cm in diameter, bibasilar consolidations/atelectasis, single bulla in the right lower lobe, some air trapping in the right lower lobe, and degenerative joint disease of the spine.
A Persantine MIBI in [**2198-12-25**] showed no reversible or fixed ischemic defects with normal wall motion and an ejection fraction of 70%.
Sputum cultures and blood cultures were all negative.
