CXR revealed left pleural effusion but no CHF or PNA.
Due to pulsatile HA there was concern for ICH so a head CT was performed which revealed no ICH.
Due to CP and pulsatile HA with hx of AAA there was concern for aortic and carotid dissection so there was decision for MRA of the chest and head.
MRA/ MRI revealed no acute infarct or dissection of intracranial or thoracic vessels.
TTE was performed due to concern that effusion was due to CHF which revealed only minimal AS with preserved EF.

Patient's ECHO is without wall motion abnormalities.
Further urine studies suggested that the patient was not pre-renal and her disease is likely a result of progressive atherosclerotic disease.
She had a Renal US which was negative for obstruction.
Her creatinine peaked at 3.2 and then decreased to 3.0 and she was discharged home with plans for close follow up.
