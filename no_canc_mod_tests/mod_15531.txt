This is a 56-year-old male who has had several week symptoms including dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] and transferred for cardiac catheterization on [**2142-11-19**] to [**Doctor First Name **]-[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Cardiac catheterization revealed 80% left main disease and 100% right coronary artery disease.
Total cross-clamp time 37 minutes, total cardiopulmonary bypass time 66 minutes.
On postoperative day number one, 24-hour events included blood transfusion times one for a hematocrit of 27.
Post-transfusion hematocrit was 28.
The patient also had decreased urine output and a blood pressure of 65 for which he was administered 2 mg of Neo-Synephrine and administered Lasix for the decreased urine output.
Vital signs were stable, in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 92.
White count 10, platelet count 286,000.
Renal came by to see the patient for the patient's decreased urine output, at which time they recommended to increase the intravascular volume and increase the patient's blood pressure by transfusing [**11-29**] units of packed red blood cells and starting Epogen 5,000 t.i.w.
They also recommended to continue the Neo-Synephrine drip with a goal blood pressure of 130-140.
They recommended to check the urine electrolytes, sodium, creatinine, urea, and to check the urine protein-creatinine ratio.
The vital signs were stable.
The patient was in sinus rhythm at 84 with a blood pressure of 156/61 and a cardiac index of 2.95 with a BUN of 80 and creatinine of 5.9 which is up from 4.7, white count 13.8, and hematocrit of 29.1.
They also felt that since his blood pressure was improved, Lasix could be administered 100 mg IV in order to increase diuresis.
The physical examination remained unchanged.
The white count came down to 8.9, hematocrit stable at 27, BUN 92, creatinine 6.5, with adequate urine output.
Renal came by to see the patient again, at which time they recommended to transfusing to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30, continue Amphojel at 30 cc p.o.
The patient underwent hemodialysis that day which he tolerated with a blood pressure around 140-150.
On postoperative day number four, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, afebrile, with a stable white count and hematocrit, BUN 69, creatinine 5.1.
On postoperative day number five, the patient continued to remain afebrile, hemodynamically stable with a stable white count and hematocrit.
Hemodialysis was performed on [**2142-11-25**], at which time 3 kilograms was removed.
On postoperative day number six, the patient remained hemodynamically stable with a stable white count and hematocrit, BUN 83, creatinine 5.4, with an unremarkable physical examination.
On postoperative day number eight, the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable with a BUN of 74 and creatinine of 4.9.
The physical examination remained benign.
The BUN was 55, creatinine 4.3.
The plan was to continue to follow the laboratories to determine whether or not he will need further hemodialysis.
Renal came by and saw the patient on postoperative day number nine, at which time they stated that the urine output was somewhat better with a good blood pressure.
However, the creatinine was still elevated over the last 24 hours.
They recommended to repeat a stat potassium and if the potassium was better to hold off on hemodialysis with the potassium being 5.0 with slight hemolysis that day.
The vital signs were stable with a stable blood pressure of 110-160/70s-80s and the heart rate in sinus rhythm at 60.
The physical examination remained unchanged with lungs that were clear and lower extremities with mild edema.
The white count and hematocrit were stable with a BUN of 58 and creatinine of 4.2 with the plan to discharge the patient that day.
