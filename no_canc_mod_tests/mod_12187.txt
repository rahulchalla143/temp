The patient was admitted in [**Month (only) 404**] of last year, ruled out for myocardial infarction but was diagnosed with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy after transesophageal echocardiogram showed dynamic outflow obstruction with a peak gradient of 32.
A subsequent catheter showed a systolic gradient of 130 after PVC and 96 after Valsalva.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 2.
Metoprolol 50 mg q day  PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.3?????
?, pulse 72, blood pressure 125/78, respiratory rate 16.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils were equal, round and reactive to light.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABS UPON ADMISSION:  Chem-7:  Sodium 141, potassium 4.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate 25, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, glucose 101.
His CK was 1237.
CK/MB was 175.
His index was 14.1.
His white blood cell count was 12.1, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit 39.9, platelets 289.
His second CK was 1874 with a CK/MB of 281 and index of 15.
His third CK on [**7-16**], the second day of admission, was 1,119 with a CK/MB of 59 and an index of 5.3.
Fasting lipid profile was drawn on [**7-16**] which showed a triglyceride level of 178, HDL 41 and an LDL of 137 with a cholesterol to HDL index of 5.2.
Pump:  The patient's outflow gradient seemed to be decreased based on an echocardiogram done in the catheter lab, but it was not clear if the patient will have clinical improvement.
The patient had a quick CK washout as expected and peaked adequately indicating good septal ablation.
Serial electrocardiograms showed evidence of a right bundle branch block that was consistent with his prior electrocardiogram, but no other evidence of AV conduction block.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION/GASTROINTESTINAL:  No issues.
Pan cultures were negative at the time of discharge with no growth to date.
Chest x-ray was normal.
The patient was monitored per the CIWA protocol and the only evidence of withdrawal was the fever.
