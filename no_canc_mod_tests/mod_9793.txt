His serum level was 1.9 at admission.
Patient was also initially hypertensive in the Emergency Room to 220/100 and then hypotensive upon arrival to the Intensive Care Unit with a blood pressure of 84/50 which responded to intravenous fluids.
Patient also had acute renal insufficiency which had resolved by the time of transfer to the Medicine floor, but also with rhabdomyolysis with peak creatinine kinase of 31,000 on [**2173-2-16**].
Physical examination with a normal examination except notable for expressive aphasia with slurred verbalizations.
LABS ON ADMISSION TO INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  BUN and creatinine 15/1.3; hematocrit 35; white blood count 23; Dilantin level 1.9; urinalysis with large blood, otherwise normal.
Patient's liver function tests were also slightly elevated, but likely related to the rhabdo and muscle breakdown.
Patient was continued with aggressive intravenous fluids and his electrolytes were monitored very carefully.
The patient's creatinine kinase continued to trend down at the time of discharge.
The albumin adjusted serum level was monitored.
Blood pressure:  The patient was initially hypotensive in the Intensive Care Unit, but responded to intravenous fluids after the Dilantin intravenous was stopped.
The patient's white blood count was initially elevated at admission, but trended down to within normal limits.
Patient's blood cultures from admission had no growth to date.
Red urine:  The patient's red urine was likely due to myoglobinuria, hematuria from Foley trauma given the greater than 1,000 red blood cells in the urinalysis.
Anemia:  The patient's iron study was most consistent with iron deficiency.
Patient's hematocrit was stable throughout his hospital stay.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow after his Intensive Care Unit stay with intubation and was cleared for p.o.
The patient's electrolytes should be monitored closely given his rhabdomyolysis.
