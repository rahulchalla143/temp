CT scan performed in an outside hospital made the diagnosis of an acute type A aortic dissection with the dissection extending from the sinotubular junction down to and including both common iliac arteries.
Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: BP 112/62 Sedated/Intubated NCAT, anicteric sclera, ETT in place Coarse breath sounds bilaterally RRR, No murmur Abdomen is soft, nondistended.
Guaiac negative Extremities warm, 1+ edema.
Right DP pulse absent and 1+ right femoral pulse.
[**2131-8-17**] ECHO PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Dissection flap noted to involve the proximal aspect of the left subclavian artery and extending inferiorly into the abdomen.
Evaluation of the dissection flap within the abdominal aorta is limited due to technique with marked compression on the true lumen demonstrated in the abdominal aorta.
Previous CT from [**Hospital3 10377**] Hospital demonstrated marked compression of the true lumen, which supplied the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.
Although decreased left renal blood flow was noted, his urine output was sufficient and it was decided to observe him.
Labetolol was used to control his blood pressure.
A swallow evaluation was performed which showed him to swallow effectively.
On postoperative day seven, Mr. [**Known lastname 12997**] was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
A renal MRA was obtained which showed the right renal artery was supplied by both lumens, with the dissection flap extending into the proximal aspect.
Labetalol restarted on [**9-26**] for hypertension and his renal function was monitored closely for possible continuing compromise of flow.
Gentle diuresis restarted on [**8-29**] after renal perfusion scan done.Renal artery intervention was discussed with the pt., but he refused.
Repeat CXR will be done with appt.
3)  Report any weight gain of 2 pounds in 24 hours or 5 pounds in 1 week.
CXR prior to seeing Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
You will need to have a Chemistry 10 / Complete Metabolic Panel drawn to assess your Creatinine 2 days prior to your visit.
