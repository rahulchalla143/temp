He was seen by the Ortho-spine service due to multiple compression fractures noted on CT to determine if they were old or new.
After reviewing the MRI with Radiology it was determined that all the fractures were old.
As there was no change in his exam and his Head CT was unchanged after 24 hours they recommended a follow up head CT in 4 weeks and a follow up appointment at that time.
He had some swelling of his fingers but good CMS and his right arm was elevated to reduce the edema.
From a neurologic standpoint he remained seizure free however his dilantin level was 8 on [**2187-10-12**] which reflected a dose of 200 mg PO TID.

You will need a Head CT prior to that appointment and the secretary will scedule this for you.
