He responded well to CPAP and BP improved with nitro gtt.
History of MRSA from sputum in [**2185**].
Physical Exam: VS: T99.3, BP 130/70, RR 16, Sat 93% RA GEN: Pleasant, comfortable, no acute distress HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, mmm, OP without lesions NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no JVD RESP: Crackles at the bases bilaterally L>R, poor air movement CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, systolic murmur ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e, warm, 2+ pulses; trace edema bilaterally SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice NEURO: Alert and oriented, conversational Fem line C/D/I  Pertinent Results: [**2187-1-8**] BCx, HD line: CN-SA (vanco [**Last Name (un) 36**], MIC's <1, 2) [**2187-1-9**] UCx: <10K organisms [**2187-1-10**] BCx, fem line: CN-SA (vanco [**Last Name (un) 36**], MIC 2) [**2187-1-10**] Cath tip Cx: CN-SA (vanco [**Last Name (un) 36**], MIC 2) [**2187-1-10**] BCx, PICC: CN-SA (vanco sense, MIC 2) [**2187-1-11**] BCx, PICC: No growth x2 [**2187-1-13**] BCx, PICC and HD line: No growth\ [**2187-1-14**] BCx, PICC: No growth x2 [**2187-1-16**] BCx, PICC: No growth x2 .
CXR [**2187-1-9**]: AP chest compared to [**1-1**] and 26 shows subsequent improvement in diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality which had worsened between [**1-1**] and [**1-8**].
ECHO [**2187-1-9**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with mid to apical anteroseptal and anterior akinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-12-28**], left ventricular wall motion is similar.
ECG [**2187-1-13**]: Technically difficult study.
Anteroseptal infarct - age undetermined.
Lateral ST-T changes offer additional evidence of ischemia Since previous tracing of [**2187-1-9**], anterior ST segment elevation and T wave inversion less prominent.
His SOB was thought to be secondary to fluid overload, although underlying etiology unclear as multiple echocardiograms have not shown dramatic change in cardiac function.
# Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive at baseline, and blood pressures can be very labile.
Of note, blood pressures increased to 190's systolic or higher during episodes of gastroparesis.
In addition, blood pressures drop to the 110's systolic after hemodialysis; the patient's antihypertensive regimen was held as needed post dialysis.
The patient's troponins trended down from their peak.
When gastroparesis episodes were refractory, the frequency of his PRN's were increased and blood pressure was monitored and controlled.
Blood culture drawn from HD catheter on [**1-8**] grew out vancomycin sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococcus.
Femoral line cultures from [**1-10**], femoral line time (removed [**1-10**]) and PICC line cultures (placed [**1-10**]) all grew out CN-SA.
Subsequent surveillance blood cultures from HD and PICC were NGTD until discharge, though final reports were pending.
# Anemia: Anemia studies were suggestive of borderline iron deficiency anemia, with a marginally elevated ferritin.
Femoral line d/c [**1-10**].
Your electrocardiogram showed abnormalities that were thought to be related to your recent heart attack and not a new heart attack.
