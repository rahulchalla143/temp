In the ED at the OSH a CXR was performed which reportedly showed a pneumonia per [**Hospital1 18**] ED call in.
Upon transfer to our ED, initial vitals were T 99.1 HR 98 BP 102/69 RR 20 O2 sat 100% 2L NC.
His BPs were consistently 90s-low 100s while in the ED, and in the setting of probable pneumonia, he is being admitted to the ICU for further monitoring and care.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2114-11-22**] atrial fibrillation with occasional ventricular paced rhythm persists.
Cx - negative [**1-12**] - [**Last Name (un) **] Cx.
[**2115-1-17**] CXR AP port: The heart size is moderately enlarged, slightly increased in size compared to the previous study.
[**2115-1-17**] CT head without contrast: IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or infarct.
[**2115-1-18**] CT head without contrast: IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 76 year-old male with CAD s/p MI x 2, VF arrest, CHF with EF 20-25% in [**9-15**] s/p ICD placement, A. fib, and CKD admitted with pneumonia.
Patient was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin with improvement of WBC and cough.
# Pneumonia: Admission CXR showed a RLL opacity, possibly chronic, consisted with soft tissue v. infiltrate as well as a retrocardiac opacity representing atelectasis v. infiltrate.
PVR showed no evidence of obstruction.
# Congestive heart failure, diastolic, EF 20-25%: The patient was given IVF as necessary, as above, but generally maintained BP 100-120 SBP.
The patient had one episode of VT on telemetry (asymptomatic) for which the patient was evaluated by EP.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x 3 with no EKG changes concerning for ischemia (but difficult to interpret given V-pacing).
[**1-17**] INR was elevated at 3.7, but serial head CTs ([**1-17**] and [**1-18**]) were negative for IC bleed.
Etiology of stroke was unclear, but unlikely due to IC bleed given lack of CT findings, and unlikely to be cardio-embolic given supratherapeutic INR.
Fasting lipid panel was checked, as shown above.
# Anemia:  Baseline hct appears to be predominantly 33-35, with hct during admission within baseline.
Iron studies were felt to be consistent with iron-deficiency anemia, and the patient was started on supplementation.
MVI 1 PO daily 10.
A CT scan of the head was negative for evidence of bleeding.
Weakness showed signs of significant improvement by discharge.
