Patient came to work and went to a conference, and his chest pain exacerbated, despite nitroglycerin use.
Of note, on [**6-26**] patient was admitted for chest pain, and was taken to cardiac catheterization with DES to RCA ostium given in-stent restenosis (70-80%).
Six days later ([**7-2**]) patient had similar chest pain, underwent another catheterization with stent placement in LCx, and resulted in normal flow, with no dissection or residual stenosis.
On arriving the CVICU, patient had VS of T 96.5, HR 80, BP 105/51, O2 Sat 98% on 2L.

However, on review of previous angiograms, it was apparent that the slow flow in that branch was not a new phenomenon.
Final angiograms obtained after PCI showed no dissection, perforation or any other mechanical complication.
Arterial time = 2 hours 26 minutes.
ETT ([**2136-7-6**]): This 75 year old man with h/o multiple PCIs most recent PCI to RCA on [**2136-6-26**] and PTCA to Cx on [**2136-7-4**] was referred to the lab for evaluation of chest pain.
Blunted blood pressure and heart rate responses to exercise.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 75 yo M with remote hx of coronary vasospasm, h/o CAD s/p [**11-3**] drug eluting stents in the past four years, HTN, DM2, Hyperlipidemia, diastolic CHF (EF in [**6-29**] 45-50%) with recent admission a week ago, s/p two cardiac catheterizations, p/w recurring resting angina today, and was thought to have printzmetal angina.
Three cardiac catheterizations were performed in the past week, resulting in the placement of drug eluting stents in the potential flow restricting loci, including the LCX and the ostium of a prior stent in RCA.
There was a transient elevation of CK-MB on HD#2, with no associated angina symptoms or EKG changes, which was most likely a result of periprocedure ischemia.
An exercise stress test was done on the third day that showed non-specific ST-T wave changes.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES - STARTED nifedipine 30 mg daily - CHANGED losartan 75 mg to 50 mg daily .
His blood pressure remained stable.
We discontinued his metformin and switched him on sliding scale insulin with qid glucose monitoring.
His creatinine was at his baseline during this admission.
You also had an exerceise treadmill test to asses your exercise tolerance that showed non specific ST-T wave changes of unknown significance.
You were able to exercise to 2.9 METS, but the study had to be stopped prematurely due to hip pain.
During this hospitalization, we made the following changes to your medications: DECREASED Losartan to 50mg PO Daily STARTED Nifedipine CR 30mg PO Daily  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
