MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction, if indicated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-5-21**], right atrial and right ventricular cavity enlargement with now identified, with marked right ventricular free wall hypokinesis and new tricuspid regurgitation.
CXR (admission): IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR (intubated): FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position.
Septic shock was the most likely etiology, given her respiratory symptoms prior to admission, but her skin was cool on exam and all cultures were negative.
With marked peripheral edema and cool extremities, we also considered cardiogenic shock, which was supported by an echocardiogram showing increased right-sided failure, confirmed on repeat echo.
Central venous access was obtained and an arterial line was placed for close blood pressure and ABG monitoring.
The patient's blood pressure began to drop once again and she was placed on phenylephrine and eventually needed to be started on norepinephrine + vasopression with minimal effect.
On admission, her respiratory status was close to baseline, but her progressive lung disease combined with the fluids she was given to support her blood pressures would intermittently put her into pulmonary edema.
Her oxygen requirement slowly climbed and her chest x-rays appeared to worsen, requiring intubation due to increased work of breathing, outstripping non-invasive ventilation.
Her arterial blood gases were consistently acidotic with relatively normal [**Name (NI) 96100**], indicating a metabolic acidosis that was not correcting.
Her CT head was negative and her shock was treated as above.
Her sensorium improved briefly for 1 day, but quickly deteriorated during her respiratory failure.
DIC labs were normal and she was continued on heparin SQ.
RUQ U/S showed an incidental finding of ?acalculous cholecystitis and IR was consulted.
