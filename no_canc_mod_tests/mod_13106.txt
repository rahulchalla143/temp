An angiogram was performed, and a coiling of the aneurysm was done on [**2180-10-3**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed the patient's temperature was 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 128/39, his heart rate was 53, his respiratory rate was 17, and his oxygen saturation was 100%.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's white blood cell count was 11.7, his hematocrit was 30.6, and his platelets were 363.
The patient's prothrombin time was 15.6, his partial thromboplastin time was 150, and his INR was 1.6 (after his angiogram).
The patient's sodium was 140, potassium was 4, chloride was 113, bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was 19, his creatinine was 1.2, and his blood sugar was 153.
Postoperatively, he was kept on heparin and aspirin for one to two days to keep his partial thromboplastin time at a goal of 60 to 70 overnight.
Postoperative, the patient's vital signs revealed his blood pressure was 131/45, his heart rate was 60, his respiratory rate was 13, and his oxygen saturation was 98%.
The patient's temperature was 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
His postoperative hematocrit without 30.6.
His partial thromboplastin time was 150.
His INR was 1.6.
His heparin was kept at 800 units per hour to keep his goal partial thromboplastin time between 60 and 80, and these levels were checked every four hours.
His systolic blood pressure was in the 150 range.
On the morning postoperatively (on [**2180-10-4**]), the patient's temperature was 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 127 to 174/40s to 50s, his respiratory rate was 20, and his oxygen saturation was 96%.
24 hours overnight he was positive 116 for his fluid balance.
His heparin was 800 an hour, and Nipride was at 3.
His white blood cell count was 15.9, his hematocrit was 33.6, and his platelets were 422.
His partial thromboplastin time was 81.8.
The patient was very lethargic on examination in the morning.
A STAT head computed tomography showed a very large bifrontal hemorrhage which extended through the corpus callosum which faced the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], lateral ventricles, and sulci of the frontal lobes.
Intracranial pressures were in the 12 to 13 range.
A follow-up head computed tomography was completed.
His blood pressure was kept below 140.
We continued to keep his blood pressure less than 140 using mannitol as needed.
No response to painful stimuli.
On [**10-8**], it was felt that the patient's examination had been unchanged.
A further brain death examination was done on 11:30 on [**10-8**].
Again, the patient was unresponsive to deep painful stimuli.
Oculovestibular testing was performed.
A discussion again was in the presence of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 50473**] and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 50474**] [**Known lastname 50473**] in the presence of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3065**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3903**] (nurse practitioner).
At 2315 brain death testing was performed per protocol, and check was completed.
