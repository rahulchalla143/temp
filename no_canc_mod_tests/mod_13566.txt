PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient's vital signs were temperature 96.5, heartrate 125, blood pressure 124/60, and the patient was on a ventilator.
Initially the patient had a hematocrit of 35.3 and BUN of 20.
Creatinine was 1.1 and his INR was 1.3.
Lactase was 3.9.
The patient was taken to the computerized tomography unit to obtain computerized tomography scan of the head which showed right frontal contusion, left subdural hemorrhage and left orbital fracture and fourth rib fracture, right axillary sinus fracture, basilar skull fracture and petrous bone fracture.
Computerized tomography scan of the spine was done at the outside hospital which was negative by report.
Computerized tomographic angiography of the head and neck was negative for any vessel injury.
Computerized tomography scan of the chest showed a left clavicular hair fracture and lateral lung contusion, rib fractures and the patient also had a humeral head fracture.
Neurosurgery was consulted, and ICP monitor was placed by Neurosurgery for monitoring his intracranial pressure and the patient was given intravenous antibiotics for his open fracture and Vascular Surgery and Orthopedic Surgery were also consulted.
The patient had ICP pressure of 4 and the patient appeared to be somewhat stable.
The patient had a repeat head computerized tomography scan for Neurosurgery to assess this intracranial hemorrhage which appeared with no change.
The patient also underwent subsequent head computerized tomography scan again on [**11-11**] which showed no change in his intracranial hemorrhage.
The patient's hematocrit was stabilized around 28 and INR was stable around 1.2.
On [**11-13**], the patient underwent another head computerized tomography scan which showed no change in terms of his intracranial bleed or hemorrhage and ICP drain was then subsequently discontinued by Neurosurgery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well postoperatively and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further care.
The repeat head computerized tomography scan shows no change from previous intracranial bleed.
The patient had a panculture and sputum grew out Acinetobacter and pseudomonas and blood culture at the same time grew out Acinetobacter.
Chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural effusion, although no frank pneumonia was seen.
On [**2200-11-21**], the patient had a repeat head computerized tomography scan which was negative and still showed the right frontal contusion and subarachnoid hemorrhage was unchanged.
At the same time Neurosurgery agreed with heparin subcutaneously for the patient and the patient was placed on the heparin subcutaneously and inferior vena cava filter was removed on [**2200-11-23**] and the patient had bilateral lower extremity ultrasound which showed no deep vein thromboses, prior to the inferior vena cava filter extraction.
and Captopril was added for better blood pressure control.
The neurologist saw the patient and recommended a spinal tap and computerized tomography scan with intravenous contrast to further evaluate to rule out cerebrovascular accident and rule out the meningitis, given the patient's history of open skull fracture.
Computerized tomography scan with intravenous contrast on [**11-26**], shows no embolic or hemorrhagic infarct and his right frontal contusion is about the same as previous.
His left subarachnoid hemorrhage has improved prior to previous, and a lumbar puncture was performed on the patient with approximately 10 white blood cells, however, the lumbar puncture grew out coagulase negative Staphylococcus for which we consulted Infectious Disease.
Prior to discharge, the patient was afebrile, vital signs stable, chest clear, abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, and the patient has a feeding tube placed and was tolerating tube feed as goal, tolerating at 60 cc/hr.
The patient underwent a swallow evaluation prior to discharge, however, due to the patient's inability to cooperate fully it was felt that it is far better to continue on with feeding tube for two weeks prior to arranging for a more permanent access.
