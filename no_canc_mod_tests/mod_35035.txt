GCS was 9 at the scene.
Head CT there with ICH.
Motor/Sensory: No response to noxious stim throughout (again pt sedated for imaging at the time of my initial encounter).
Pertinent Results: CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**4-4**]: CT OF THE CHEST: There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is marked periportal edema.
The spleen, liver, pancreas, and adrenal glands are otherwise within normal limits.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.
Head CT [**4-4**]: FINDINGS: There is re-demonstration of the extensive, multicompartmental hemorrhages described in the previous report.
CONCLUSION: Stable, abnormal study as noted above.
Head CT [**4-6**]: FINDINGS: Overall, little change is demonstrated to large left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 3.8 cm in anteroposterior dimensions and right temporal parenchymal hemorrhage measuring 3.4 cm in anteroposterior dimensions.
MRI C-spine [**4-4**]: FINDINGS: There is no sign for malalignment of the component vertebrae.

EXAMINATION: CT of the head without contrast.
COMPARISONS: Comparison to CT of the head from [**2178-4-10**] and [**2178-4-6**].
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.
Left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage demonstrates a very slight reduction in size measuring now 3.8 x 2.1 cm where on prior examination it measured 4 x 2.4 cm.
There is mild effacement of the left-sided perimesencephalic cistern that is unchanged since prior examination from [**2178-4-10**] with no progression.
There has been little overall change in a right anterior temporal epidural hematoma which measures 1.5 cm where from prior examination it measured 1.4 cm.

COMPARISON: CT head [**2178-4-13**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial images of the head are obtained with 5-mm section thickness.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: The hyperdense portion of a left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage demonstrates slight reduction in size, currently measuring 3.5 x 1.9 cm compared to 3.8 x 2.1 cm on [**4-13**].
Limited evaluation of known right anterior frontal epidural hematoma, though slight increase in size of the fluid collection is suggested.

His TBI was followed by serial CT scans that have remained stable.
MRI imaging of his neck was obtained to clear c-spine.
A trach and peg were performed on [**2178-4-7**] [**1-5**] to poor gag reflex and continued altered mental status.
He has slowly awakened to the point of being able to pass Speech and Swallow evaluation on [**2178-4-13**].
His cidff culture is negative.

?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
