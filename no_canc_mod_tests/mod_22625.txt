The stomach and duodenum are filled with blood clots suggesting additional hemorrhage from a more proximal site (esophageal varices) 3.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
No specific CT evidence to suggest active GI bleeding.
The remainder of the examination is essentially unchanged since study of [**2118-6-24**].
Persistent GI oozing from unknown source - s/p angiox3, RBC scans, CTAs; ?jejunum.
