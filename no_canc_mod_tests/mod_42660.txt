Echocardiogram in [**2134-12-6**] showed a moderately dilated left atria, mildly dilated left ventricle, ejection fraction of 60 to 70%, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets, mild mitral valve prolapse, partial mitral leaflet flail with 3+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2135-3-7**], which showed an ejection fraction of 60% with 2+ mitral regurgitation and no coronary disease.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Chest x-ray showed a right sided pleural effusion.
By postoperative day number two the patient's hematocrit had stabilized and there was no drainage of the chest tube, however, the patient continued to be anemic.
The patient was again transfused packed red blood cells and given Lasix and the patient's hematocrit over the next several days began to climb.
Repeat chest x-ray showed elevated right hemidiaphragm with little change between inspiratory and expiratory films, right middle and right lower lobe atelectasis.
Chest x-ray after this was done showed a small right apical pneumothorax unchanged from the previous films.
On postoperative day number five the patient's last remaining right pleural chest tube was removed and post removal chest x-ray showed unchanged from previous chest x-rays, which was small bilateral effusions right greater then left, elevated right hemidiaphragm, right middle and right lower lobe atelectasis and a small right apical pneumothorax.
