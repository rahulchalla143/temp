RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):       SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
Blood Cx: No growth to date  Urine Cx: Group B streptococcus >100,000 organisms  Imaging/Studies: CXR [**2118-8-31**]: Portable upright chest radiograph is compared to [**2118-8-30**].
ECHO [**2118-8-29**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Cardiac Cath [**2118-8-27**]: 1.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-domimant system revealed single-vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated biventricular filling pressures and RA / PCWP pressures suggestive of right ventricular infarction, with depressed cardiac output.
Final angiography showed TIMI 3 flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.
HIs BP and HR were stable at discharge on current meds.
# Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient had an acute RV infarct and his hemodynamics in the cath lab demonstrated increased biventricular filling pressures.
A TTE after cath showed an LVEF>55% and no wall motion abnormalities.
His platelets dropped from 293 on admission to 116 on day 5 of heparin.
There was concern for HIT so heparin was stopped and a heparin antibody was pending at time of d/c.
His HCT was stable but low at 27, likely [**3-14**] phlebotomy and extreme illness.
Patient may benefit from a sleep study as an outpatient.
Outpatient Lab Work: Please check CBC in 1 week.
We sent an anti-platelet antibody to see if it is positive.
