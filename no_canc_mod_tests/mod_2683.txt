Hct dropped from baseline 23-25 to 18.
Had repeat ERCP [**2160-1-10**] which did not identify obvious source of bleeding, however cauterization was done at an area near the sphincterotomy that was likely the source.
Patient did well post-EGD, diet as advanced, and hct remained stable.
Due to his recent bleeding we discussed the risks and benefits of anticoagulation and the decision was made with the patient to start coumadin as an outpatient in 10 days if HCT remained stable.
Tacrolimus level was 2.8, so dose was increased from 2.5 to 3mg.
HCT check 3 days after dc planned.
