In the ED she was noted to have a positive troponins (.36) with an EKG showing concerning changes (c/w inferior STEMI) compared to 3 days prior to her admission.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted, and initally offered the family cardiac catheterization which they refused.
Her troponins peaked at her admission value as did her CKs at 310.
She was given IV nitro, IV Lasix, Etomidate, Versed and fentanyl and her blood pressure dropped to 70.
She was given 300cc IVF and her SBP increased to 90's.
Per family's request, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.
On transfer, she was intubated and sedated, with stable VS (T 98.2 HR 88 BP 131/57 O2 99% on 70% FIO2).
NECK: Supple with JVP of 3cm above clavicle at 30 degrees.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+ .

CXR [**2170-9-10**]: AP chest compared to [**9-8**] through [**9-10**] at 11:39 a.m. at [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital.
CXR [**2170-9-12**]: In the interim from the previous examination, an endotracheal tube and esophageal catheter have been removed.
TTE [**2170-9-11**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Cardiac cath [**2170-9-11**]: 1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated severe 2 vessel CAD.
2) Resting hemodynamics showed severe left-sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 50 mmHg.
Final angiography revealed TIMI 3 flow with no residual stenosis or angiographically-apparent dissection.
# STEMI: On transfer, pt's family expressed that they wanted to proceed with cardiac cath.
BMS x1 was placed in RCX.
CXR initially c/f multifocal pna and she was continued on vanc/levofloxacin/flagyl (started at BIDN).
By HD#3 her CXR showed significant improvement and her antibiotics were discontinued.
She was breathing comfortably on room air with O2 sats >95%.
She was evaluated by speech and swallow service, and video swallow showed dysphagia with esophageal diverticulum above UES.
Transitional issues: - Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization.
