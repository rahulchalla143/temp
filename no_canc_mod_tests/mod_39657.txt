PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.2, BP 148/78, heart rate 75, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 100% on room air, weight 139.8 pounds.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count was 7.3, hematocrit 32.5, platelet count 174, creatinine 9.3, BUN 61, with a potassium of 7.7 (which was hemolyzed), calcium was 9.7, magnesium 2.1, and a phosphorous of 5.
Her AV fistula was cannulated on the upper without any problem.
She appeared confused, only responded to painful stimuli and sternal rub.
Her O2 saturation dropped to the mid 80s.
A head CT was done.
Head CT demonstrated no acute intracranial hemorrhage, and the recommendations from neurology included MRI/MRA to evaluate for stroke.
Of note, during hemodialysis the patient had a low blood pressure of 70/40.
This responded to Trendelenburg position and a fluid bolus.
Her blood sugar was normal.
The patient was also transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 20.
Hematocrit increased to 28.
Extensive venous collaterals were demonstrated at the right upper chest, shoulder, and the right upper arm.
On [**2-8**], the patient underwent an MRI of the chest and mediastinum to evaluate the left arm for future access to rule out central stenosis.
This study demonstrated a widely patent left subclavian vein, internal jugular vein, brachiocephalic vein, and superior vena cava.
An occlusive thrombus was noted within the right brachiocephalic vein with partially occlusive thrombus in the right subclavian vein.
After discussion of MRI findings with the patient's daughter, a chest CT without contrast was done to evaluate the left upper lobe lesion.
Given this rapid development compared to a chest radiograph from [**2174-12-16**] a neoplasm seemed unlikely.
Her vital signs were stable.
An EEG was recommended by neurology.
Blood sugars were controlled with her regularly scheduled insulin.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on [**2-9**] included a white blood cell count of 8.2, hematocrit of 26.5, platelet count of 255.
Sodium 140, potassium 4.7, chloride 100, bicarbonate 29, BUN 22, creatinine 4.9 and a glucose of 97.
Calcium was 7.3, magnesium of 1.7, phosphorous of 3.1, albumin of 3.4.
Vancomycin level on [**2-2**] was 18.9.
