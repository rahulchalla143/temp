Heart sounds were mildly distant, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs appreciated.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had labs that were notable for admission white count of 3.1 with 11 percent polys, 31 percent bands, 39 percent lymphs, 4 percent monos, hematocrit 34.4, platelets 184.
Chemistry-7 was sodium 139, potassium 4.3, chloride 112, bicarb 11, BUN 48, creatinine 2.0, glucose 105.
Calcium 7.0, magnesium 1.6, phosphate 6.8.
CK was initially 247 that rose to 1400.
MB was 12 and rose to 55.
UA was notable for trace leukocyte esterase, large blood, 21 to 50 red cells, no white cells, no nitrite, trace ketones.
ABG on arrival was 6.96, 48, 91; subsequently 7.01, 36, 72.
Lactate was 5.4.
She had CT of her head which showed no hemorrhage, but chronic microvascular change.
CT of the chest showed bilateral infiltrates and small effusion.
Chest x-ray was read as anterior consolidation, collapse of the left lower lobe, ill-defined perihilar opacities and possible right pleural effusion.
Blood and urine cultures were pending.
The latest EKG at 17:30 showed multifocal atrial tachycardia at 120, normal axis, normal QRS, normal QT, decreased voltage in limb leads, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in leads 2, 3 and aVF.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Over the course of hospitalization, the patient developed progressive acidemia with pH dropping to 6.8 with refractory hypoxemia despite aggressive oxygenation with PO2 of 30 and oxygen saturation of 60.
Despite these interventions, we could not restore the patient's blood pressure nor her oxygenation level to normal.
Over the next several hours the patient's blood pressure slowly dropped despite the pressors and she became more acidemic and refractory in terms of her hypoxemia.
