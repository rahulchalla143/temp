EKG 1 14:08 Atrial fibrillation with RVR, rate 179, NA, LBBB (old), TWI V5-V6 EKG 2 16:38 NSR rate 93, NA, LBBB, TWI V5-V6 .
Radiologic Data: [**2166-3-27**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral effusions and atelectasis.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
TSH was WNL.
There was no e/o acute MI, with negative cardiac enzymes x 2 and no acute ST-T changes consistent with ischemia on EKG.
Her CHADS2 score was 3; however, after discussion of risks and benefits with the patient and her family they declined anticoagulation given her high fall risk.
CHF:  She was noted to have a new global hypokinesis with EF 30-40% on this admission.
As above, there was no e/o acute MI on admission given negative cardiac enzymes and no acute ST-T changes consistent with ischemia on EKG.
Echo showed no WMA.
She should have a repeat ECHO in [**1-27**] months to reassess with her LVEF.
