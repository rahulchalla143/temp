She was seen by hematology and blood bank for initiation of plasmapheresis.
Hematology and blood bank both recommended initiation of plasmapheresis given the high suspicion for recurrent TTP.
The hematology fellow contact[**Name (NI) **] her hematologist at [**Hospital6 **] and, reportedly, the patient has been found to *not* have an ADAMSTS-13 inhibitor in the past, and thus corticosteroids were not felt to be necessary.
An ADAMSTS-13 assay was sent (though she had received plasma at the outside hospital).
She was noted to have asymptomatic pyuria on a urinalysis and culture was sent off.
A CT of her head demonstrated evidence of an old right basal ganglia infarction and new acute abnormalities.
If symptoms recur, consideration should be given to an MRI and/or neurologic consultation.
She should have a CBC and LDH checked later today.
