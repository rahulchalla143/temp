She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization prior to undergoing a scheduled aortic valve replacement.
Cardiac catheterization performed on [**2119-11-16**] revealed a right dominant system with single vessel coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 0.86 cm squared and a mean gradient of 33 mm Hg, left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 58%, and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 24.
The patient describes a history of scarlet fever as a child, arthritis of both knees, history of renal calculus, significant hearing loss, cataract surgery, status post D&C, status post bilateral knee replacements, bilateral appendectomies, status post tonsillectomy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL: Temperature 97.3, blood pressure 128/52, pulse 62 and regular, on room air oxygen saturation is 95% and respiratory rate of 20.
Pulmonary examination:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Coronary examination was regular, rate, and rhythm with a systolic murmur evident.
She had a stable cardiac rhythm at that time and her epicardial wires were discontinued to facilitate emergent MRI scan to evaluate the etiology of her seizure activity.
These cultures other than a positive urine culture for E. coli ultimately were negative.
Patient was placed on ceftriaxone empirically pending results of a culture which was sent at that time.
Patient was transfused to maintain a hematocrit of approximately 30%.
She also was placed on intravenous Levophed to keep her systolic blood pressure greater than 130 mm Hg to optimize cerebral perfusion at the recommendation of the Neurology staff.
A repeat CT scan on [**11-19**] showed no hemorrhage with no evidence of shift and some, mild edema in the right frontal lobe area.
An electroencephalogram was done at that time which was consistent with mild encephalopathy, however, no focus seen for seizure activity.
She was maintained on Dilantin to prevent further seizure activity and her electrolytes were being repleted.
Repeat head CT scan also on the [**11-22**] revealed evolution of multiple small right frontal and parietal infarcts.
Chest x-ray at that time revealed a left lower lobe collapse and some left pleural effusion.
Chest x-ray showed a persistent left lower lobe collapse with some effusion.
[**Name (NI) **] chest x-ray showed a continued left pleural effusion for which a chest tube was placed.
It was felt that she visually did at least fairly well by her bedside evaluation and a modified barium swallow is recommended to be followed up on.
Patient's white blood cell count at this time rose to 22,000 and she was again pancultured.
Her white blood cell count had come down minimally to 20.8 thousand, however, she had a fever of 101.7.
Three Clostridium difficile specimens were sent and were all negative, as well as subsequent stool cultures which also came back negative.
White blood cell counts were slowly coming down to 16.9 thousand and all subsequent cultures came back positive.
Her white blood cell count has been slowly decreasing.
Patient is in normal sinus rhythm at 82/minute, her blood pressure is 110/54, her oxygen saturation on a 2 liter per minute nasal cannula is 96% with a respiratory rate of 23/minute.
Most laboratory values are from today, [**12-4**] which revealed a white blood cell count of 13.0 thousand, hematocrit of 32.3, platelet count of 480.
PT of 20.6, INR of 2.8.
Sodium of 143, potassium 3.9, chloride of 106, CO2 20, BUN 14, creatinine 0.7, glucose 99.
Her respiratory examination is stable.
Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her sternum is stable with a small amount of serous drainage at the top area of her wound.
Most recent Vancomycin levels revealed a trough of 6.8 and a peak of 18.1.
Patient is on a sliding scale of regular insulin coverage for a glucose of 150-200 she should receive 3 units subQ, blood glucose of 200-250 6 units subQ, and a glucose of 250-300 9 units subQ.
Her INR should be between 2 and 2.5 as a goal for her stroke as well as atrial fibrillation.
