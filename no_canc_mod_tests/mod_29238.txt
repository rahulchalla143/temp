Head CT scan revealed intraparenchymal hemorrhage; he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued trauma care.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  Reason: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **]  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 23 year old man s/p MVC c IPH in R basal ganglia and occipital lobe REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR ANGIOGRAPHY  HISTORY: Evaluate extent of diffuse axonal injury.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained.
COMPARISON STUDY: CT scan of the same day.
CONCLUSION: More extensive shearing injury, both nonhemorrhagic and hemorrhagic, compared to the recent CT scan, as noted above.
MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES  TECHNIQUE: Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
COMPARISON: MR brain dated [**2129-5-25**] and non-contrast head CT dated [**2129-6-3**].
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed through the brain prior to and following the administration of gadolinium.
Diffusion- weighted imaging was performed.
MR OF THE BRAIN: The examination is markedly limited by patient motion during image acquisition on nearly all sequences.
A right frontal subdural collection containing hemorrhagic products which are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on gradient echo sequences, is increased in size from the prior MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**5-25**] and probably stable in size in comparison with the head CT of [**6-3**], [**2128**].
Evaluation of the signal abnormality within the right pons, which appears contiguous with signal abnormality involving the right internal capsule, is somewhat limited due to motion artifact, although probably unchanged.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]:  TECHNIQUE: 3D time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES: The vessels of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and its major tributaries are patent without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm.
TECHNIQUE: AP supine single view of the abdomen.
He underwent further imaging of his head; MRA did not reveal any vascular injuries; MRI of the head did reveal diffuse axonal injury.
He remained in the ICU for several weeks; he initially had problems with elevated heart rate and blood pressure; both improved with IV Lopressor and Hydralazine.
He was also followed by Neurology during his hospital stay; EEG monitoring was performed and revealed no seizure activity.
Inform the office that a repeat head CT scan will be needed for this appointment.
