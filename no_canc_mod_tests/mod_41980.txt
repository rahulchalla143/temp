She was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where vitals were BP 132/72, HR 131, satting 100% on RA with no recroded RR.
EKG at the OSH showed sinus tachycardia to 133, normal axis, normal intervals, flattened TW in AvL and V1 with good R wave progression in the anterior leads.
Labs were significant for an EtOH <10, WBC of 37.4 with 28.9 absolute PMN count, HCT of 39.5, plts of 502. .
She was given 2 mg of midazolam  Initial VS were: temp 102.6, Labs showed WBC of 24.5, H/H 10.7/33.7, K 2.6, lactate 2.4.
ABG showed 7.38/31/139.
Blood cultures were sent.
Surgery rec'd a CT A/P which showed stable positioning of patient's perc drain with minimal resolution of prior fluid collection and no evidence of new collections or abscesses.
Neuro rec'd to continue the cooling protocol with EEG, check dilantin level and continue 100mg q8hrs, obtain LP to eval for infectious source of fevers and seizure, and to consider loading with Keppra or start midazolam drip if continued seizures.
EKG showed shivering artifact but evidence was ventricular bigeminy and sinus waves.
Right corneal reflex intact, left not brisk to corneal irritation.
Down going babinski's b/l with 2+ patellar/bicipital reflexes b/l.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2113-4-21**]   Neurophysiology EEG   [**2113-4-21**]: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of the presence of a few isolated paroxysmal potential epileptiform transients in the left central region.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2113-4-20**]   Neurophysiology EEG   [**2113-4-20**]:  This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of the presence of a diffuse severe encephalopathy.
These also should be monitored for detection of seizures.
EMS and police were contact[**Name (NI) **] to attempt to discern her heart rhythm at the time but AED could not be interrogated.
CKs were elevated by MB was largely unremarkable.
Initial TTE showed EF 35-40% with moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction in a non-coronary distribution.
TTE was later repeated which showed normal functions in both ventricles.
Four sets of blood cultures from [**2113-4-19**] grew staph epi and coag neg staph (not sensitive to oxacillin).
Her JP drain was sent for culture and grew pseudomonas sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
Repeat blood cultures and c.diff assay were sent which returned negative.
Urine tox was positive for barbs and benzos which she had received at OSH.
There was no evidence of IC mass/process on stat head CT. Lumbar puncture showed no growth in CSF fluid.
CT A/P in the ED showed drain in appropriate place and no new evidence for abdominal catastrophe.
She was kept on vanc/zosyn initially and switched to vanc/cipro when JP drain culture grew pseudomonas sensitive to cipro.
Repeat CT of the abdomen showed only slight decrease in the size of the abdominal fluid collection.
# Hep C - last month VL at 72,762 IU/mL.

Initial image of your heart showed slowing of activities but that was in the setting of you going through cooling for your seizures.
You had a repeat image after you left the intensive care unit which showed normal function of your heart.
You also had blood cultures which showed a bacteria in your blood.
You had a repeat CAT scan of your stomach which showed that the infection was not completely gone.
