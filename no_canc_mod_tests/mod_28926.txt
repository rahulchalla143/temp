Selective coronary angiography demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease in this left dominant circulation.
Resting hemodynamics from right heart catheterization demonstrated severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP=17mmHg and mean PCWP=33mmHg).
Cardiac output and index were severely depressed at 2.5 L/min and 1.3 L/min/m2 respectively.
Left ventriculogram was not performed to reduce contrast load.
PCI of the LAD and diagonal complicated by distal embolization into the diagonal.
An EKG performed at the time showed ST segment elevation in V4-V5, Q waves in leads II, III, avF, and atrial fibrillation.
A nitroglycerin drip was then started and brought the patient some relief with 2/10 chest pain.
Cardiac enzymes at the time showed an elevated CK of 2519.

On IABP, cardiac index improved to 1.7, and although patient diuresed successfully with 40mg IV Lasix, nesiritide gtt was started to further improve hemodynamics.
On hospital day two, cardiac index improved to 2.3 on nesiritide and IABP, and both were discontinued on hospital day three as patient continued to do improve in function with excellent diuresis on lasix alone (PAP 43/21).
Echocardiogram revealed EF<20%, 1+ MR, 1+ TR and global hypokinesis.
CK peaked at 4538, MB >500 on the evening of hospital day one consistent with transmural infarction.
* Urinary Tract Infection: Patient had a low grade fever (100.5) on hospital day four, and urinalysis revealed sm leuk esterase w/ few bacteria.
* Dehydration: Patient was initially diuresed aggressively given cardiogenic shock, however, near the time of discharge, patient had mild bump in creatinine (chronic renal insufficiency Cr 1.1-1.2) to 1.5, and urine lytes revealed prerenal (UOsm [**Telephone/Fax (1) 63454**] mg/dL UCreat 86 mg/dL USodium 15 mEq/L).
Repeat echocardiogram in one month following discharge.
