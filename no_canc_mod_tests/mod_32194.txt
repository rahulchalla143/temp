Initial vitals were t99.1 111/67 130 14 100 RA.
ECG was noted to be without signs of TCA toxicity and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
At [**Hospital1 18**], vitals initially p 110 bp 130/70 28 98 4L.
EKGs were monitored Q1 hr; no abnormalities including QT or QRS elongation were seen.
No intracranial process was seen on CT, and CXR was within normal limits.

Brief Hospital Course: # TCA overdose: Patient presents with intoxication of doxepin; toxicology screen was positive for methadone, TCAs, and cocaine.
Patient states that last methadone dose was x2 weeks ago and she took suboxone x2 days prior to admission.
Patient was initially admitted to the medical ICU where she was intubated to secure the airway, serial EKGs were done (all showed NSR without abnormalities), and patient was monitored.
On HD #2, patient was extubated, and was monitored for symptoms of hypotension, palpatations, chest pain, or any other symptoms of TCA intoxication.
She was then transferred to the medicine services after patient's peak for toxic symptoms were over (active metabolites 12-24 hours), EKGs remained normal throughout the course, and she exhibited no symptoms upon discharge.
#Anemia: Patient presented with hematocrit of 31.5 (baseline unknown), with microcytic features and wide RDW.
Iron levels are low (20) with low TIBC (257), and her low MCV (68) do not suggest a complete iron deficiency picture.
#Elevated WBC and fever: The patient had elevated WBC (20) and low-grade fever 100.4 in the MICU, but trended down while admitted to the medicine floor (WBC 12, temp 98.2).
She has no indication of infection as she clinically has no syptoms of fevers/chills and does not feel overall unwell; in addition, CXR shows no abnormalities.
Your laboratory values and EKG were stable, and you were then transferred to the medicine floor.
