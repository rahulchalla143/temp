Head CT [**1-3**]: IMPRESSION: Status post evacuation of right-sided subdural hematoma with small amount of high-density blood remaining layering posteriorly.
Head CT [**1-15**]: FINDINGS: Heterogeneous fluid collection and subdural hematoma in the right frontoparietal convexity is stable to slightly increased in size compared to prior study.
Torso CT [**1-17**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head +/- [**1-18**]: FINDINGS: The frontal component of the hypodense right subdural collection appears stable measuring 13.5 mm in maximal transverse dimension.
Its isodense occipital component is more conspicuous on the postcontrast images of this study compared to the noncontrast images of this and the previous studies.
LENIS [**1-13**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
CT Head [**1-25**]: Considering technical differences the right frontal and right occipital extra-axial fluid accumulation is relatively unchanged in size measuring approximately 13 mm in the right frontal region and 12 mm in right occipital region.
The study is otherwise unchanged since [**1-24**], [**2149**].
CT Head [**2-3**]: FINDINGS: Frontoparietal craniectomy with unchanged right frontal and occipital extra-axial low-density fluid collections.
The following day the ICU team stopped the antibiotics due to a clear chest x-ray and normal secretions.
The patient's neuro exam remained stable in that he was moving all 4 but he was somewhat lethargic.
A repeat head CT on [**1-14**] was stable.
His fever workup was negative for DVT, PNA, c-diff.
His white count was starting to increase however.
The patient's neuro exam was improving and he became more alert and engaged by the 23rd.
His white count continued to rise and his sed rate was elevated to 70.
His CT was improved post-operatively.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] neuro exam was stable while he was intubated.
His cultures grew MSSA so antibiotics were tailored to this.
On [**2-2**] a repeat head CT was stable with no obvious fluid collection.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
?You will need a CT scan of the brain with & without contrast.
