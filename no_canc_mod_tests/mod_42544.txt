CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST  HISTORY: Sudden onset of severe headache.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted MR images were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla magnet without the administration of intravenous gadolinium.
COMPARISON EXAM: Chest radiograph on [**2125-2-5**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MDCT images of the head were obtained and displayed in 5-mm axial reconstructions.
COMPARISON: Head CTs [**2121-12-6**] through [**2125-2-6**].
Lumbar Puncture: Opening pressure was 27 cm of water [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name **] Virus, Qualitative Real Time PCR   EBV DNA, QL PCR         Not Detected Herpes Simplex Virus, Type 1 & 2 DNA, Real-Time PCR   HSV 1 DNA                Not Detected   HSV 2 DNA                Not Detected  Gastric Emptying Study: IMPRESSION:  Normal gastric emptying study, with no scintigraphic evidence of reflux.
Head CT was without bleeding, and Head MRI/MRA/MRV was without bleeding or vascular malformation or venous thrombosis.
They recommended an LP to rule out [**Doctor Last Name **] or infection given his vague symptoms.
Given the non-specific headache, an LP was performed after patient ultimately consented.
It was decided to discontinue his nifedipine and start verapamil, as verapamil is more vasoactive; this medication would help vasospasm, migraine, and HTN etiology.
It was felt that an injection would not be helpful, given the diffuse nature of his headaches.
He also had severe nausea and vomiting that was controlled with reglan, compazine, and zofran, which was also thought to help his headaches.
All opiates, topomax, and gabapentin were all d/c'd.
Also, HTN headaches did not show a clear pattern, it is striking how when his blood pressure is ideally controlled, his headaches have cleared.
His MICU course was uneventful as his blood pressure decreased with IV hydralazine x 1 and po labetalol, along with taking his BP medications.
He did not need an IV drip for blood pressure.
Near the end of his hospitalization, his blood pressure was lower than expected with levels in the low 100s.
It was also noted that he was not wearing his clonidine patch for several days in the setting of well controlled blood pressures.
# Nausea/Vomiting: This was initially thought to be due to gastroparesis, but a GES was performed which showed normal motility.
His metoclopramide was continued, as was compazine and zofran.
Further evaluation of this standing medication should be evaluated by his PCP at his next visit.
LP negative besides increased ICP of 27 mm Hg.
Optho re-consulted [**2-18**] and confirmed complete CN3 palsy as the cause of diplopia and complete ptosis of left eye.
A chest x-ray did not show any acute finding.

We were concerned that your headache might be from a [**Hospital1 **] in your head but the ct scan of your head did not show any bleeding.
We did check an MRI of your head to see if we could see any blood vesels likely to [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and that showed did not show a source of bleeding.
A lumbar puncture was eventually performed by interventional radiology and your CSF fluid was negative for bleeding or infection.
Your blood pressure was also very high during this hospital stay.
During your hospital stay, you were briefly transferred to the intensive care unit for closer evaluation of your elevated blood pressure.
You were monitored closely and your blood pressures decreased.
More blood pressure medications were added and your blood pressure became ideally controlled.
You will be followed up by Neuro-opthomology for further evaluation of this.
