Angiography images reveal widely patent bilateral carotid, Circle of [**Location (un) 431**], and vertebrobasilar systems.
----- MRI head with and without contrast/MRA [**2191-4-19**]: There is a large amount of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe, as described on previous imaging.
T1 pre- and post-contrast images show no evidence of underlying mass lesion.
Angiography of the carotid, circle of [**Location (un) 431**], and posterior circulation is unremarkable.
----- CT head without contrast [**2191-4-21**]: Again, there is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage occupying much of the left temporal and parietal lobe, causing mass effect and left to right midline shift, which appears slightly increased.
----- CT head without contrast [**2191-4-22**]: : Again seen is the large left temporal lobe hypodensity with hemorrhagic conversion, which is stable in size.
----- CT head without contrast [**2191-4-27**]: Hyperdensity in the left temporal lobe has decreased in amount.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the NeuroICU for evaluation of her left temporoparietal bleed.
Neurology: CT angiogram demonstrated a large filling defect in left internal jugular vein and left transverse sinus; the lumen of the left internal jugular vein was obliterated at the level of the foramen magnum along with a large temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild mass effect.
Given the hemorrhage, she initially maintained on a Labetalol drip to keep systolic blood pressure <160.
Therefore, she was started on anticoagulation with heparin with a goal PTT of 40-60 to prevent clot proliferation.
Several days later, coumadin was started with goal INR [**3-10**].
Both clinical exam and serial head CT demonstrated stable size of hemorrhage, even with anticoagulation.
Although most of these studies are pending, antithrombin III was low at 48 (normal 80-120).
Telemetry monitoring demonstrated no evidence of arrhythmia.
Blood pressure was well controlled on her home regimen of Lisinopril.
Hematology: Hypercoagulability labs demonstrated a low level of antithrombin III.
Given nature of venous clot and infarction, anticoagulation was initiated with heparin goal of PTT 40-60 and coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**].
Infectitious Disease: Urine culture on [**4-19**] grew pan sensitive Enterococcus.
Last INR 1.8 [**2191-4-27**].
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
Warfarin Sodium 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): Goal INR [**3-10**].
History of ovarian cysts and painful menses 5.
