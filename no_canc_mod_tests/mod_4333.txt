Temperature was 100.9.
Chest x-ray was normal.
Labs were notable for a glucose of 646, positive serum ketones and a creatinine of 2.2.
He was given three liters IV fluid and blood cultures, time two, were drawn.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: Blood pressure 129/66; heart rate 108; respiratory rate 18; temperature 102.8; oxygen saturation 98% on two liters.
HEENT:  Examination revealed the right pupil opacified with left pupil, which was minimally reactive.
ABDOMEN: Examination revealed soft, nontender, nondistended belly with normal bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Examination revealed 3+ pitting edema bilaterally.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Examination revealed no focal signs.
LABORATORY DATA:  Data revealed the white blood cell of 22.5, hematocrit 42.8, platelet count 209.
Urinalysis revealed the glucose of 500, no red cells, and no white cells.
Chemistry panel revealed the glucose of 646, creatinine of 2.2.
The initial CK was 265 with MB of 7 and a troponin of 2.0.
The CSF analysis revealed glucose of 270, two white blood cells, 40 protein, and negative gram stain.
Chest x-ray:  Portable chest x-ray was done and revealed poor inspiration, but no active cardiopulmonary process.
The EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per minute, axis -30, normal intervals, small Qs in V1 and V2 consistent with an old anteroseptal infarct, no significant change from a previous [**2139-11-27**] EKG.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, status post renal transplant times two, who present with hyperglycemia volume depletion, metabolic acidosis, with positive serum ketones secondary to likely diabetic ketoacidosis.
The patient was also febrile with elevated white blood cell count and tender MCP joints suggesting the diagnosis of cellulitis versus gout.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was started on insulin drip for a diabetic ketoacidosis in order to keep his blood sugars between 100 and 200.
The patient's blood sugars remained elevated in the 300s, likely secondary to the fact that he was receiving steroids.
The patient's electrolytes were monitored and repleted as necessary.
Prograf levels were checked in order to maintain adequate immunosuppression.
Blood cultures revealed no growth by the time of this dictation.
However, the fact that the patient did have some evidence of myocardial leak, suggested that he may need an outpatient stress perfusion test in the future to evaluate for ischemia.
