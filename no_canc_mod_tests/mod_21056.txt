The patient's initial electrocardiogram at outside hospital showed no ST elevations but questionable Q waves in V1 through V3.
Chest x-ray at that time was consistent with congestive heart failure and BNP measured was 2710.
Events that occurred after initial evaluation at outside hospital included a dropping hematocrit from 30.7 to 25.2.
She received a total of four units of packed red blood cells with a rise in her hematocrit to 36.0 to 37.0.
The patient was diuresed with Lasix aggressively for congestive heart failure with creatinine rising to 2.3 from baseline of 1.6.
The patient also received transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2103-5-11**], at outside hospital which by report showed ejection fraction of 25 to 30% with anterior, inferior, and apical akinesis, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs revealed temperature 99.8, blood pressure 146/44, pulse 57, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 94% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - Small but reactive and equal pupils bilaterally.
Extremities - trace to 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema to the knees, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, warm and well perfused.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission laboratory data was significant for laboratories from outside hospital showing hematocrit 37.2, creatinine 1.6, partial thromboplastin time 41.2.
Urinalysis showed positive nitrites, large leukocyte esterase, 90-100 white blood cells, many bacteria, greater than 100,000 gram negative rods.
Troponin I peak at 0.11.
CK peak at 110.
Coronary artery disease - Status post non ST elevation myocardial infarction - The patient was evaluated by CT surgery here and catheterization films reviewed by cardiology and CT surgery staff.
[**Street Address(2) 2811**] elevations in V2 through V3, 1.
Her baseline electrocardiogram on arrival had been notable for deep T wave inversions in the precordial leads.
Each of these episodes of chest pain was in the setting of the patient being hypertensive to systolic blood pressure of 180s to 190s and tachycardic to low 100s.
The patient responded each time to aggressive blood pressure lowering with beta blockade, increasing Nitroglycerin drip, sublingual Nitroglycerin times three, Hydralazine and Magnesium Sulfate.
Her hematocrit was rechecked and noted to be stable and groin sites intact without abdominal or lower back pain, suggesting no retroperitoneal bleed.
Her electrocardiograms were unchanged at this time, suggesting her pain was not cardiac in nature.
Congestive heart failure - The patient with ejection fraction of 25 to 30% noted on recent transthoracic echocardiogram with apical akinesis.
We started her on Coumadin given apical akinesis and the patient will follow-up with primary care physician for INR levels as an outpatient.
Her bibasilar crackles did not seem to change throughout her admission despite initial diuresis.
However, creatinine began to rise, also perhaps secondary to catheterization dye.
On discharge, we have restarted low dose of [**Last Name (un) **] as creatinine decreasing and stopped Hydralazine.
The patient had renal ultrasound to rule out renal artery stenosis given large episodic increases suddenly in blood pressure though these were associated with chest pain.
Creatinine here peaked at 2.4 likely secondary to prerenal cause and contrast dye induced nephropathy.
Creatinine appears to be trending down and we are allowing the patient to take p.o.
Hematocrit remained stable throughout hospitalization.
Prophylaxis - Heparin drip, subcutaneous Heparin while on bedrest, with bowel regimen.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Cardiac diet and repleted electrolytes p.r.n.
