RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2133-1-20**]): MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2133-1-20**]):  - No respiratory viruses isolated.
Culture screened for Adenovirus, Influenza A & B, Parainfluenza type 1,2 & 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus.
Detection of viruses other than those listed above will only be performed on specific request.
Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2133-1-18**]):  - Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
RADIOLOGY: 1. initial CXR and CT performed at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]  2.
[**2133-1-21**] portable CXR: AP chest compared to large area of left lower lobe consolidation and a smaller region on the right have both improved minimally since [**1-19**].
On examination he continued to have diminished breath sounds at his left base with no other abnormal lung findings.
He will need repeat LFTs, INR, and consideration for a repeat CXR to ensure resolution of his pneumonia.
