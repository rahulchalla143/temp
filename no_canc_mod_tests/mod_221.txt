Her previous UGIB required hospitalization, which was notable for a hematocrit of 16 on during stay, 2 units of fresh frozen platelets, esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing gastritis and normal duodenum, cauterization of a gastric AVM, and angiography followed by embolization of left gastric artery.
In the Emergency Room she was found to be in no acute distress and with a temperature of 99.5, blood pressure 143/53, pulse 86, respirations 16, 98% on room air.
Nasogastric suction revealed 200 cc of coffee grounds and lavage with 250 cc H20 showed coffee grounds and a bright red tinge, but lavage was stopped, because of patient discomfort.
Diverticula seen on colonoscopy [**7-/2193**].
Vital signs temperature 99.5.
Blood pressure 120/60.
Pulse 86.
Respiratory rate 18.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES AND STUDIES:  White blood cell count 11.1, hemoglobin 10.3, hematocrit 27.9, platelets 235, MCV 85, MCH 29.3, MCHC 34.4, neutrophils 87.9%, lymphocytes 8%, bands 0, monocytes 2.6%, eosinophils 1.1%, basophils 0.1%, sodium 128, potassium 4.6, chloride 94, bicarbonate 27, BUN 47, creatinine 1.1, glucose 122, calcium 8.5, magnesium 1.8, phosphate 2.8.
PT 13.4, PTT 30.1, INR 1.3.
Electrocardiogram heart rate 84 beats per minute, normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**6-18**], which showed diffuse gastritis and a normal duodenum consistent with what was seen during admission a year before.
On [**6-25**], enteroscopy showed improved gastritis and a normal duodenum and jejunum.
Colonoscopy on [**6-29**] showed retained melena and multiple nonbleeding diverticula, but no source of bleeding.
A tagged red cell scan on [**6-23**] did not identify a source of gastrointestinal bleeding either.
H-pylori antibody test was negative.
On the evening of [**7-1**] (hospital day fifteen), the patient had a dramatic gastric bleed with a hematocrit drop from 27.7 to 17.4.
The patient became more tachycardic then baseline to 130s, but maintained her blood pressure.
On the evening of hospital day seventeen, the patient was transferred back to the Medicine Floor with stable hematocrit of 36.7.
However, one day after the transfer, her hematocrit dropped to 24.1 with bloody diarrhea.
By hospital day twenty the patient appeared stable with stable tachycardia and blood pressure.
It appeared that gastrointestinal bleeding either slowed or stopped, so after discussion between the patient and the family and a hematocrit check was done, which at the value of 26.4 showed that she had stopped bleeding.
Two more units of red blood cells were transfused to increase her hematocrit to at least greater then 30.
Some hematologic workup was done to look for other causes of continued bleed, which was negative for GIC, hemolysis and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease.
Her vital signs remained stable with a blood pressure in the 140s/80s and heart rate in 80s until hospital day five when she started having sinus tachycardic 100 to 130s.
During the remainder of th hospital course her heart rate remained elevated in the 100s.
After the precipitous hematocrit drop on hospital day fifteen, the patient's cardiac enzymes were checked and they revealed a mild enzyme leak with CK 118 and 128, MB 8 and 9 and troponin 0.9.
Urinalysis showed 245 white blood cells and blood culture was negative.
During the MICU stay her white blood cells spiked to 19.9, but she was afebrile and there was no clear source of infection (no pneumonia on chest x-ray, negative urine culture).
The white blood cells went down to 12.3 after transfer to the medicine floor.
Atenolol 20 mg once a day hold for systolic blood pressure less then 110, heart rate less then 60.
