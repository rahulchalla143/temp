The patient had a biopsy of those ulcers, which showed leukocytoblastic vasculitis.
She had a chest CT at that time, which showed patchy ground glass opacities.
She underwent bronchoscopy and was found to have bloody frothy sputum that was felt to be consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
In the Emergency Department the patient was increasingly tachypneic with oxygen saturations less then 60% on 100% nonrebreather and was emergently intubated.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On MICU evaluation the patient's vital signs were temperature 99.3.
Blood pressure 96/36.
Her pulse 94.
She was ventilated, sating 99% on assist control with tidal volume to 700, breathing 12 times a minute with a PEEP of 10 and FIO2 of 1.
Funduscopic examination was limited, however, the patient did not appear to have any raw spots.
Cardiovascular examination was difficult due to body habitus, but was regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs.
The patient's abdomen was benign, soft, obese with multiple surgical scars, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Her fingers were notable for small purple lesions less then 2 mm in diameter that were scattered across her fingertips.
The patient's other laboratories were remarkable for a white blood cell count of 19.6 with a differential of 88 neutrophils and 9 bands, hematocrit of 25.8, which is down from 28.7 on discharge.
Platelets 506.
Electrolytes, sodium 137, potassium 5.1, chloride 105, bicarb 20, BUN 23, creatinine 0.7.
The patient's baseline creatinine appears to be between .7 and .9.
The patient's urinalysis was remarkable for large blood, trace protein, leuk and nitrite negative.
The patient's urine was done and did not reveal any casts.
The patient's laboratories from previous hospitalization that were notable were TSH 2.2, P-ANCA that was positive with a titer of 58,000, [**Doctor First Name **] positive at 1 to 150 with a negative double stranded DNA.
Chest x-ray on admission showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates particularly on the right that were consistent with an ARDS like picture as well as bilateral patchy alveolar infiltrates.
The patient's bronchoscopy samples were sent for a fungal, bacterial and viral cultures.
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics while her cultures were pending and treated with 1 gram of intravenous Solu-Medrol for five days.
The patient's cultures from the bronchoscopy remained negative, thus her antibiotics were discontinued and she was eventually weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated on [**2183-11-11**].
The patient was gradually weaned from her oxygen, however, she still had a significant oxygen requirement on discharge requiring 4 liters of oxygen at rest to maintain saturations above 90%.
Her P-ANCA titer was quite elevated on admission in the range of 60,000.
The patient also had CRP that was 24 and an ESR, which was 30, however, that was similar to her ESR prior to her discharge from previous hospitalizations.
The patient's urine was followed throughout the course of her admission.
Hematocrit:  The patient's hematocrit was 25.8 on admission, dropped to as low as 22.8.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells with an improvement in her hematocrit that was appropriate.
The patient was guaiac negative and her hemolysis laboratories were negative.
Likely the drop in her hematocrit was due to her diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
In the setting of immunosuppression it was decided to cover her with broad spectrum antibiotics until her bronchoscopy cultures and blood cultures remained negative.
All of her cultures remained negative throughout the course of her hospital stay.
The patient's antibiotics were stopped 48 hours after bronchoscopy when all of her cultures were still negative.
Urinalysis prior to discharge was concerning for urinary tract infection, however, was contaminated with a large amount of squamous epithelial cells.
The patient's urine culture was sent and was pending at the time of discharge.
for a five day course unless the urine culture proves to be negative.
