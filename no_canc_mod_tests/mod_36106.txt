Reason for MICU transfer: Massive PE, intubated on pressors   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ACLS for pulselessness  History of Present Illness: 63 year old female with h/o HIV on HAART (CD4 1049) and recent L5-S1 fusion 3 weeks ago who presents with hypotension and seizures.
BP on arrival by EMS was 60/palp which improved to 74/palp after 500cc IVF.
CTA showed massive saddle PE.
She was hypotensive with SBP in the 30's and was intubated and started on peripheral levophed.
SBP decreased to the 50's and she lost a pulse and chest compressions were started, 1mg epi given, pulse returned after 1 minute.
Her BP's began to improve and SBP was 170's and pressors were weaned.

Blood and urine cultures pending.
However, there is evidence of right heart strain, including dilation of the right atrium and right ventricle, leftwardbowing of the interventricular septum, and reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins.
Prominent main PA suggest associated pulmonary hypertension.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
TTE showed global RV dilation/disfunction and severe TR w/ preserved LVEF.
The Lovenox was discontinued when her INR was therapeutic.
Her INR on day of discharge was 2.4.
She will need to be set up with coumadin clinic as an outpatient for INR monitoring.
She remained stable, and on day of discharge, the oxygen was weaned with a respiratory rate in the 20s.
Her neurological exam was non-focal and consistent with her exam on presentation to the medicine floor.
Despite being afebrile without a leukocytosis, an infectios work-up was repeated.
So far, this work-up has returned negative.
An active type and screen was maintained through the entire admission.
# Transaminitis: During the admission, AST as high as [**2140**] and ALT in 700s.
His LFTs were trended through the admission and steadily fell during the admission.
Elevation was in setting of massive PE, shock, right heart strain and delivery of chest compressions.
TTE showed dilated RV with severe systolic dysfunction.
#Idioventricular rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry through her admission.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were flat.
Cardiology was consulted and felt her rhythm was from an irritable focus secondary to her ventricular remodeling in the presence of her massive pulmonary embolism.
No clear source of infection, as no consolidation on recent CXR; blood cultures remain negative to date.
On day of discharge, the patient's urine culture returned showing enterococcus in the urine susceptible to ampicillin, macrobid, and vancomycin.
The patient will need to have a repeat urine analysis on [**2152-8-29**] to determine if the patient is still infected.
If her urine analysis returns suggestive of urinary tract infection, send a urine culture and consider starting the patient on vancomycin.
If her urine analysis is sterile, complete the full 14-day course of antibiotics.
Ortho was followed the patient and recommended that her hematocrit be monitored given her recent surgery and TPA administration.
Infectious work-up negative to date, with negative urine culture, no PNA on CXR, and blood cultures negative to date.
When patient complained of worsening chest pain, EKGs were done that did not show significant differences from prior EKGs.
Cardiac enzymes were flat on the day of discharge.
Her pressures remained elevated and thus her home lisinopril was increased to 10mg daily.
-Outpatient INR follow-up to ensure that the patient is therapeutic on warfarin.
INR needs to be between 2 and 3.
Patient will need to have regular INR checks and warfarin titrated to maintain therapeutic INR.
-follow-up of pending blood cultures .
-The patient will need to have a repeat urine analysis on [**2152-8-29**] to determine if the patient is still infected.
If her urine analysis returns suggestive of urinary tract infection, send a urine culture and consider starting the patient on vancomycin.
If her urine analysis is sterile, complete the full 14-day course of antibiotics.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR and CBC [**2152-8-21**], [**2152-8-24**], and [**2152-8-27**].
This blood clot likely came after your surgery, and formed in your legs then traveled to your lungs.
The effects of this medication are checked with a blood test called the international normalized ratio (AKA INR).
Your INR is a number that reflects the "thinness" of your blood, and the goal INR for your treatment is between [**1-6**].
Your INR will need to be checked frequently in the beginning of your treatment (3-5 times a week), and will gradually be checked less (3-4 times a month) as your medical team helps adjust your medication to keep your INR between [**1-6**].
You should anticipate occassional warfarin dose adjustments (maybe more in the beginning), in order to keep your INR in the 2-3 range.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is important that if you suffer a fall or traumatic injury while taking warfarin that you call your doctor or report to the emergency room for evaluation to make sure you are not bleeding internally.
You will need to be followed the [**Hospital 197**] clinic for monitoring of your blood INR while you are on Coumadin (also known as warfarin)  *Anticipated stay at rehab is less than 30 days.
