In ED her vitals were BP 132/50, HR 76, O2 sat 95% on RA.
She was found to have a hematocrit of 37.
CT of the head revealed no evidence of acute bleed.
Her hematocrit on admission to the ER was 37 on [**8-19**] at 12 AM.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds were performed given assymetric lower extremity edema which were negative for clots.
She underwent CT of the abdomen which showed a large hiatal hernia with a thoracic stomach and no evidence of pancreatitis despite incidentally noted elevated pancreatic enzymes.

CT Head [**2192-8-19**]: Despite repetition, some of the posterior fossa scans are degraded by patient motion.
However, if the latter diagnostic consideration is a possibility, an MRI scan would be a more sensitive means for detecting an area of acute infarction.
CT Abd [**2192-8-19**]: 1.
Intrathoracic stomach which may represent gastric volvulus.
Bilateral LE US [**2192-8-19**]: Grayscale and Doppler examination of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
Upper Endoscopy [**2192-8-21**]: Findings: Normal esophagus, large hiatal hernia with [**Location (un) 3825**] lesions, normal duodenum.
Small amount of barium aspiration noted in the central airways.
Followup chest x- ray is recommended if there is concern for development of pneumonia.
Echocardiogram [**2192-8-22**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT Head [**2192-8-24**]: 1.
Her hematocrit on admission was 37.2.
A CT scan of the abdomen was performed in the emergency room which revealed the presence of a large hiatal hernia with a complete intrathoracic stomach.
The patient underwent upper endoscopy on [**2192-8-21**] which revealed no obvious bleeding sources but confirmed the presence of the large hiatal hernia with the presence of [**Location (un) 3825**] lesions.
Given that her hematocrit had stabilized and there was no obvious bleeding source on endoscopy no further workup was initiated.
# Hiatal Hernia: The patient was noted to have a large hiatal hernia on CT scan.
Her lovenox was discontinued when her INR was within therapeutic range.
Over the remainder of her hospitalization her coumadin was titrated to a goal INR between 2.5 to 3.5 for patients with a mechanical valve and atrial fibrillation.
She will need to have her INR monitored every other day at her nursing home until her INR is stable.
On admission her antihypertensive medications were held in the setting of acute bleeding but were restarted once serial hematocrits were stable.
An echocardiogram was performed during this admission which revealed mild symmetric LVH, no regional wall motion abnormalities, LVEF of > 55%, and a well-seated aortic valve prosthesis with normal disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
# CAD - The patient has an unclear cardiac history but on CT scan she has evidence of CABG and takes a beta blocker as an outpatient.
A lipid profile was obtained to further assess her cardiac risk.
Her LDL was elevated at 133 and given her history of CAD she was started on simvastatin 10 mg daily.
Given that her blood pressures continued to be elevated in the 140s on her outpatient regimen she was started on lisinopril 5 mg daily during this admission with good blood pressure control.
She takes vitamin D and Calcium as an outpatient and these were continued during this admission.
Baseline hematocrit is unknown.
Further workup was not pursued during this admission given her acute bleeding episode.

You underwent upper endoscopy which did not identify a clear source of bleeding.
You had a CT scan of your head which showed no evidence of bleeding in the brain  You had a CT of your chest which showed that your stomach is located above your diaphragm.
You will have to have your INR checked daily until your levels have stabilized.
