[**2172-1-11**] CXR - Likely mild-to-moderate fluid overload and retrocardiac air space opacity, atelectasis versus developing pneumonia.
[**2172-1-12**] CXR - Indwelling devices are unchanged in position.
Appearance of the chest is without change from a recent study except for slight improved aeration in left retrocardiac region.
Micro: [**2172-1-11**] Blood - pending [**2172-1-11**] Sputum - 2+ GPC, 2+ GNR; culture growing spare staph aureus and rare GNR   Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with obesity, DM, CAD, Hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH because of difficulty weaning from ventilator support after developing MRSA pneumonia.
A bronchoscopy revealed tracheobronchomalacia and he had a Y stent placed in the OR on [**2172-1-13**].
When his INR on Argatroban is between [**5-3**], Argatroban should be held for 4 hours and an INR should be checked; this INR should be between 2 and 3 for 48 hours before Argatroban can be discontinued.

His goal INR is [**3-2**].
