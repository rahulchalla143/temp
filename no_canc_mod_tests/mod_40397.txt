[**2125-1-23**] Chest X-ray (PA and Lat): No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The most worrisome makers for high-risk are INR >6.5 and pH <7.3, which she did not have.
Normal protocol recommends 16 hours of NAC and she got it for longer until her INR was <1.5 x2 days.
Currently her LFTs are improving up to ALT of 1572, AST 74 with INR of 1.1.
Leukopenia: The patient developed leukopenia with a nadir of 2.2 WBC, which was thought to be secondarely to stress/famotidine.
There was also a temporal relationship with starting famotidine, which was stopped her absolute neutrophil count is 1500.
She has an iron/TIBC <15 (8%) with a ferritin of ~600 (most likley falsely elevated given stress).
Her MCV is in the high level of normal (90s).
Reticulocyte count was inappropriately low likely due to bone marrow suppression from severe illness.
B12 and folate levels were normal.
Elevated INR: The patient's INR is downtrending and nearly normal at 1.1.
Anorexia - Pt's BMI is 17.2 with a weight of 49.9 kg (80% of her IBW of 60.2 Kg).
She is tolerating diet well and her electrolytes are within normal limits.
A TSH was checked and found to be wnl at 2.0. .
Outpatient Lab Work Please check CBC with Diff, AST, ALT, and INR on [**2125-1-29**].
