Bronchoscopy revealed that the beveled edge of the tracheostomy tube was in contact with the left lateral wall of the tracheostomy.
The patient's tracheostomy was felt to be in good position as her oxygenation and ventilation were appropriate.
It was felt that the etiology of the patient's hypertension and apparent respiratory distress were likely anxiety related as the patient's arterial blood gases and oxygen saturations all appeared to be within good limits.
Throughout her post-tracheostomy course, the patient's systolic blood pressures reached as high as 270 systolic.
In order to further work-up the patient's hypertension, urinary catecholamines were sent on [**2117-2-7**] and results of that collection are pending.
Again, on [**2117-2-7**], the patient was suctioned with a small amount, approximately 10 cc., of bright red blood per tracheostomy.
The patient is expected to undergo bronchoscopy on [**2117-2-8**].
Hematologically, the patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on [**2117-2-3**] for a hematocrit of 24.8.
The patient was transfused again on [**2117-2-7**], two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22.8.
