At that time an ultrasound was performed which showed questionable products of conception within the uterine cavity.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her vital signs are temperature 98.5, blood pressure 125/77, heart rate 75.
Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her pelvic exam reveals a 50 cc clot in the vagina.
Her hematocrit dropped from 33.1 to 24.
The ultrasound at that time showed an 8 cm clot in the endometrial cavity consistent with hematometria.
She was then taken to the Operating Room for a repeat suction D & C under ultrasound guidance.
The hematocrit prior to starting the repeat suction D & C was 19.0.
Her PT was 14.6, PTT 25.8, INR 1.4.
Her platelet count was 358.
At that time, blood transfusion was started.
The patient appeared to be developing DIC as well, thus coagulation studies were sent and one unit of fresh frozen plasma was administered.
As the patient's vital signs were stable it was decided to try embolisation as the patient strongly desired continued fertility.
Vaginal exam was performed both before the embolization and after.
She was transfused a total of seven units of packed red blood cells for a final discharge hematocrit of 31.1.
Her INR on discharge was 1.0, platelet count 174, white blood cell count 11.8, fibrinogen 274.
Her electrolytes were normal.
Infectious Disease:  Following the second suction D & C patient's temperature rose to 102.8.
Her white count also normalized.
Heme:  Her hematocrit dropped to a nadir of 19.1.
