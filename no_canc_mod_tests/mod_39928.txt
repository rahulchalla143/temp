CT was negative.
EEG revealed mild encephalopathy.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**8-30**] showed an ejection fraction of 55%.
Colonoscopy on [**2149-7-16**] revealed a sessile 5 mm polyp, diverticulosis of the transverse and sigmoid colon.
Pathology of the polyp revealed prominent lymphoid nodule, otherwise negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR:  Temperature 98.4, blood pressure 140/76, heart rate 70, respiratory rate 15, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
Pulmonary:  Decreased lung sounds at the right base, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES AND DIAGNOSTICS:  Admission white blood cell count 9.1, hematocrit 35.2, platelets 228.
Chem-7:  Sodium 134, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarb 6, BUN 22, creatinine 1.9, glucose of 479, anion gap of 30 down to 9 with insulin and IV fluids.
Calcium was 11.4 down to 8.2 with IV fluids.
Serial cardiac enzymes include troponin-T 0.02 x2, CK of 45, 49, 82.
TSH of 0.99.
Urinalysis:  Specific gravity 1.020, negative nitrite and leukocyte esterase, positive protein and ketones, 0-2 white blood cells.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2151-9-16**], no retroperitoneal hematoma.
Blood culture from [**9-14**]:  [**1-2**] gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters from the triple lumen catheter.
[**2-2**] peripheral blood cultures with gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
MRI of the brain [**2151-9-15**]:  No acute infarcts, no midline shift, no hemorrhage, old left hemi and left external capsular infarct unchanged, possible small vessel ischemic changes in the palms, chronic periventricular white matter, microvascular ischemic changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 55-year-old female with history of insulin dependent diabetes and history of diabetic ketoacidosis, hypertension, and hemorrhagic CVA in [**2147**] admitted with altered mental status with slurred speech with negative head MRI for stroke instead thought to be due to diabetic ketoacidosis.
Further workup was done for precipitation of this event including infectious workup described below.
Mental status changes:  Urinalysis and urine culture were negative.
CT of the head was negative for bleed and a MRI was done to rule out new stroke.
Chest x-ray was also done and was negative for infiltrate.
Colonoscopy in [**2149-6-29**] revealed one nonmalignant polyp.
Patient's hematocrit was followed q.d.
and she was transfused for a hematocrit less than 25.
All lines were either pulled or replaced, and a transthoracic echocardiogram was done to rule out bacterial endocarditis.
