The patient was treated for worsening anemia (Hct 23 on admission down from previous baseline of 35 in [**2147-11-13**]) in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.

EGD during this hospitalization revealed non-bleeding ulcers in the stomach and Barrett's esophagus.
Colonoscopy was negative.
His dry weight at discharge was 83kg.
Echo revealed EF>60%.
Heart rate was 60-80 prior to discharge.
At rehab on the day of admission, the patient was noted to have oxygen saturations down to 80% on RA with subjective SOB.
The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout with sbp 100-130 and asymptomatic.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
His Hct remained stable after the transfusion.
On admission, his heart failure had been exacerbated by the bradycardia, and he had evidence of volume overload with crackles on lung exam.
He was discharged with Cr 1.3.
(2) Please check INR, CBC, and chem-10 on [**2148-3-28**] at the rehab facility.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)): Please adjust dosage to INR goal of 2.0 - 3.0.  .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 1687**] - [**Location (un) 745**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Bradycardia  Secondary Diagnoses: Congestive heart failure-- diastolic Gastroesphageal reflux disease Diabetes mellitus-- diet controlled   Discharge Condition: Stable-- heart rate in the 50 - 60's; satting in the mid to upper 90's on 2 Liters supplemental oxygen; breathing comfortably.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a slow heart rate and received a pacemaker.
Because your heart rate was low, you had an exacerbation of your heart failure, requiring removal of fluid from your body with medications.
This will need to be adjusted to your blood levels, which should be followed closely.
(3) You will have blood work drawn on [**2148-3-28**] and faxed to Dr. [**Name (NI) 97349**] office.
