In the ED ENT performed an indirect laryngoscopy which revealed edema and exudate of the posterior trachea.
A gram stain revealed +1 WBC, +1 GPC, +1, GNR and +1 Yeast; throat Cx returned positive for group A strep.
Initial labs were significant for a WBC of 24 and a HCT of 43; ABG: 7.29/56/78 on 30% BiPAP.
A CT scan on [**5-22**] revealed swelling in the retropharyngeal area.
A repeat CT on [**5-24**] showed extensive infiltrate and/or hematoma in the retropharyngeal area.
CT on [**5-26**] showed decreased swelling.
The infiltrate in the LLL was resolving per CXR on [**5-29**].

MRI Neck ([**5-30**]): Diffuse oropharyngeal mucosal enhancement and subcutanous edema, consistent with cellulitis with a 1.6 X 1.0 cm right mylohyoid muscle collection and other smaller microabscesses.
CT [**2177-6-3**] 1.
Saber sheath trachea, possibly secondary to collapse of the tracheal cartilage, as there is no evidence of COPD on CT chest performed concurrently.
MRI [**2177-6-10**] (follow-up) FINDINGS: Again soft tissue edema is identified in the right side of the oro- and hypo-pharynx.
Since the previous study, the endotracheal tube has been removed and the soft tissue edema is considerably decreased with slight decrease in size of a fluid collection.
IMPRESSION: Gadolinium-enhanced imaging could not be performed.
Compared to the previous MRI of [**2177-5-30**], there is considerable decrease in swelling of the oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal soft tissues with slight decrease in size of the previously noted fluid collection.
Although S. aureus and Group A strep grew from culture data, the referring hospital's ID team felt that it was likely a polymicrobial infection that required broad spectrum coverage.
Cultures were sent from sputum, ear discharge, blood and urine.
An MRI of the neck soft tissue showed diffuse oropharyngeal mucosal enhancement and subcutanous edema, consistent with cellulitis with possible right mylohyoid abscess.
He did not tolerate bipap, but this should be readdressed with a formal sleep study as he did become intermittently hypoxic overnight requiring additional O2.
However, bronchoscopy revealed a very narrowed trachea (saber-sheath), and operative report obtained from outside hospital showed that his trachea was under the manubrium.
Further infectious work-up was negative.
# Hypertension:  Blood pressures were not elevated initially, and anti-hypertensives were held.
Creatinine increased to 2.0 and was responsive to IV fluids, improving to 1.6 prior to discharge.
- He will need repeat speech/swallow evaluation within [**1-24**] weeks  # Access: He had a PICC placed on [**2177-6-4**] at [**Hospital1 18**] in interventional radiology.
