He had a stress test [**2200-5-27**] which showed mild to moderate, partially reversible myocardial perfusion defects involving the anterior wall, apex, and septum, with transient ischemic dilatation of the LV and global hypokinesis (LVEF 30%).
Past Medical History: CAD - s/p cath [**2-/2195**] with RCA 80% stenosed - angioplasty but too small for stent.
Pulses 2+ bilaterally DP/PT.
Pertinent Results: Cardiac catheterization ([**2200-8-26**]): 1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The RCA has diffuse irregularities, which are <50%.
Left ventriculography showed a globally hypokinetic ventricle with a LVEF of 26%.
B. HTN - continue Imdur, Norvasc, Metoprolol, Lisinopril.
Dispo: Pt remained in the MICU the night before his catheterization and was stable after the procedure and was sent home with followup instructions.
