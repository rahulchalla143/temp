On [**6-26**], the patient was noted to have had a hematocrit drop from 31.6 to 27.5 and so was transfused one unit of PRBC with an appropriate bump to 31.9.
The night float resident was called to the floor on the evening of [**6-26**] due to a finding of 300 cc of BRB in the ostomy bag - MICU evaluation was called - pt found to have bled a total of 550 cc by 1 am [**6-27**], although he remained hemodynamically stable.
On evaluation by the MICU resident, he was initially found to have a pressure in the 140's, and a HR in the 80's, although he is on a beta blocker.
He subsequently underwent capsule endoscopy which revealed multiple AVM's of the small bowel.
His hct remained stable after this point in time.
ARF - It was also noted on admission, that the patient had a creatinine of 4.0.
He was discharged with a creatinine of 1.2.
CHF - The patient has a history of CHF, but on admission had denied any SOB and a CXR had shown no signs of fluid overload.
A subsequent CXR showed: "Interval development of congestive heart failure with perihilar and basilar edema and new small right pleural effusion."
The patient was still having SOB so a subsequent CXR was ordered.
