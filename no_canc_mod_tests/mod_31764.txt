As an outpatient: ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with sinus rhythm.
Labs were notable for: wbc 6.6, hgb 14.2, hct 43, plt 181, na 142, k4.7, cl 104, bun 16, cr 1.27, ap 75, ast 21, alt 24, t bili 0.7, albumin 3.7, bnp 199.
CXR showed small bilateral pleural effusions.
He then had an echo done at [**Hospital1 112**] that showed normal LV systolic function EF 65%, LV mildly enlarged at 5.6cm, mild PA pressure elevation of 35 mmHg plus RA pressure, and severe MR. .
Cardiac cath demonstrated clear coronaries, with elevated wedge pressure in the 20s.

Cardiac Cath [**2113-1-20**]: 1.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.
The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA had no angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated left-sided filling pressure with a mean PCWP of 19mmHg and prominent v-waves to 27mmHg.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension with a PA pressure of 34/11mmHg.
Systemic arterial pressures were low at 77/55mmHg.
CXR [**2113-1-20**]: Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.

He was taken to cath lab which was notable for clean coronaries and elevated wedge pressure.
On postoperative day one, he was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
At the time of discharge rigth sided CT site was draining small to moderate amount of serosang drainage.
