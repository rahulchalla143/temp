Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 35 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-15**], no change.
He had elevated biomarkers with a troponin I of 0.97, and an echocardiogram that showed anterior and inferior wall hypokineses with an ejection fraction of 35-40%.
He was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections using a 5 French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast injections.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.

Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 14 mm Hg.
There was moderate pulmonary  arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 51/25 mm Hg, associated with a mean PCWP of 22 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressure was mildly elevated at 137/83 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was reduced at 2 L/min/m2.
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease and given the severity of his disease, he was referred for surgical revascularization.
On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
On discharge his INR is to be followed by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1661**], his INR will be checked by the VNA on [**8-24**] with results called to Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1661**].
