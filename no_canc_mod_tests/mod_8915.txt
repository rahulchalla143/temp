PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On neurological examination on admission the patient was awake, but preferred to keep his eyes closed secondary to what appeared to be mild photophobia and headache.
LABORATORY:  Head CT from the outside hospital demonstrated extensive pneumocephalus bifrontally with the appearance of tension, extensive intracranial subarachnoid air opacification or sphenoid posterior and ethmoid sinuses.
The patient had an initial INR level of 4.6 as he is on Coumadin for his heart valve replacement.
Other laboratories, white blood cell count 15, hematocrit 46, platelets 197, electrolytes 137, 4.4, 102, 27, 23, .8, 141.
He could have some degree of neck stiffness, however, a lumbar puncture could not be performed, because the patient's INR was so high.
Once the patient's INR was appropriately corrected with fresh frozen platelets the patient was taken by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of otolaryngology to the Operating Room with a pre and postoperative diagnosis of right sphenoid sinus fracture with pneumocephalus.
The patient had serial head CTs as well as serial lateral skull x-rays that showed excellent improvement in his amount of pneumocephalus over time.
Final skull x-ray on [**1-1**] showed very little if any pneumocephalus.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of ear, nose and throat in one month and the patient must follow up with his primary care physician [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6739**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**1-3**] for an INR check and their office will adjust his Coumadin accordingly.
