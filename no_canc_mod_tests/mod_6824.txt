ECG - Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2159-11-23**]  8:38:06 AM.
Brief Hospital Course: Right fronto-parietal brain mass - [**11-22**] the patient was noted to develop a left facial droop w/ slurred speech.
CT scan showed a right fronto-parietal brain mass.
On [**11-22**], the patient's cardiac enzymes began to rise with a CK 85 -> 340 and troponin .02 -> .56.
Enzymes were followed and conservative management continued.
CHF  - Pt had recently had an echo performed in [**8-26**] that showed an EF of 40%.
Pt had a CXR that showed him to be in mild failure.
Acute on chronic renal failure - pt went into mild renal failure with a creatinine of 2.1 likely secondary to hypovolemia/aggressive diuresis .
His creatinine improved to baseline of 1.8 with light hydration.
Post-operative day #4 from conversion to roux-en-y - surgery was consulted to follow patient based on his recent abdominal surgery.
