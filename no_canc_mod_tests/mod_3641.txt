The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-3-27**], the findings are similar.
The exercise test was stopped at the patient's demand secondary to fatigue.
A flat blood pressure response was noted with exercise; resting standing 94/46 mmHg, peak exercise 104/46 mmHg.
Max RPP 8112, % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  55 IMPRESSION: Average exercise tolerance, however decreased in exercise time/exercise tolerance from previous ETT in [**2149-3-18**].
No exercise-induced VT. Blunted heart rate and blood pressure response to exercise.
An EP study was performed, which showed dense scar along the inferior wall from mid-wall to apex extending to the infero-lateral wall and distal septum.
PES with up to triple extra-stimuli induced only pleomorphic VT that --> to VFL --> external shocks.
The pt had multiple VT morphologies induced with cath manipulation and burst pacing.
[**Name (NI) **] during this admission showed an EF of 25%.
Recommend re-checking blood pressures at home and in her PCP's office to determine the need to re-start these medications.
