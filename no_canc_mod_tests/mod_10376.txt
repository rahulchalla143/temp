Wound left open and packed and angiogram negative at OSH.
She grew Serratia and Enterobacter in sputum and blood cultures from [**12-11**].
Since then the patient has remained hypotensive with SBP 70-90's and bradycardic with HR in 50's.

CXR [**2105-1-7**]: Large pneumoperitoneum persists, smaller since 6:31 p.m. on [**1-6**].
CT Torso [**2105-1-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Injection of contrast material showed no leak.
Bone destruction and fluid collection in right acetabulum/proximal right femur consistent with known hardware infection.
MRI brain [**2105-1-1**]: IMPRESSION: Limited due to significant amounts of patient motion artifact.
TTE [**2104-12-31**]: Conclusions: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is hard to assess given the limited views but susptect it is mildly decreasedl (LVEF 45-55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular systolic function is hard t oassess given the limited views but suspect normal function.
Sputum culture [**2105-1-2**]:   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2105-1-2**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.

Her Vanc level was elevated at 25 prior to discharge, so her random vanc level should be rechecked on [**1-9**].
If her level is still >15, then her Vancomycin 750 mg q 24 hr dosing will need to be adjusted.
# ID: The pt was hypotensive on transfer, felt to be due to sepsis in the setting of fever, WBC of 20, and enterobacter and serratia in her blood culutres from [**12-11**].
Her blood pressures remained borderline and she intermittently required levophed and 250 cc IV fluid boluses while being diuresed.
On [**1-2**], the pt spiked a temp and again had an increased WBC and was restarted on Vanc/Meropenem for presumed VAP and possible sepsis (had increased resp.
Her coumadin was restarted after trach, so INR will need to be monitored.
Her metoprolol had been stopped due to hypotension.
#CHF: The pt had an EF of 45%, repeat TTE showed EF 35%, and then repeat TTE showed EF again of 45%.
MRI/MRA of the brain was a poor study but did not reveal etiology of the weakness.
C spine MRI also did not reveal any etiology of the weakness.
However, as per above, MRI of the head did not validate this concern.
Surgery felt the PEG was in proper position without complication (after CT of the abdomen was performed), so tube feeds were initiated in the pt without difficulty.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid [**Month/Year (2) **]: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
