CT scan of the head showed no hemorrhage or fracture, only significant right-sided soft tissue swelling.
CT scan of the spine showed only stable old C2 fracture and slight anterior C4-C5 listhesis, for which she was put in a collar.
His course was also complicated by metabolic acidosis, mixed anion gap and nonanion gap, which was resolving on transfer to the [**Hospital **] Medical Team.
Coronary catheterization on [**7-8**], [**2193**], after loss of consciousness showed three-vessel CAD (LM 50-60, LAD T.O., LIMA-LAD patent with 50% to 60% stenosis and retrograde LAD, LCX 70-80, proximal OM1 high grade times two, OM2 70-8, SVG-OM2 patent, RCA T.O.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2193-6-17**] after loss of consciousness showed LV ejection fraction 25%, septal and apical wall motion abnormalities, moderate MR, tricuspid valve gradient of 37 indicating moderate pulmonary hypertension.
No arrhythmia was documented, but EKG showed on incomplete right bundle branch block.
CT angiogram did not reveal pulmonary embolism.
Transthoracic echocardiogram and catheterization as above.
PROBLEM #8:  Positive PPD in [**2190**] with no related abnormalities on chest x-ray at that time.
PROBLEM #11:  C1, C2 spinal fusion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.2, pulse 52 to 60, blood pressure 131/28 to 158/56, respirations 16 to 24, oxygen saturation 97 to 100% on five liters face tent.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data:  On admission the WBC was 8.6, hematocrit 24, platelet count 347,000, PT 13.4, INR 1.3, PTT 37.4, fibrinogen 221, sodium 136, potassium 4.3, chloride 105, CO2 20, BUN 9, creatinine 1.3, glucose 95, inonized calcium 1.08, phosphate 3.4, magnesium 1.5, amylase 38, lipase 18, serum ethanol 247, urine toxicology screen negative.
ABG revealed the pH of 7.30, pCO2 46, pO2 34.
On transfer to the Medicine Service, white blood cells were 17.8, hematocrit 36, platelet count 157, PT 12.4 with INR of 1.1, PTT 34.1, sodium 137, potassium 4.9, chloride 107, CO2 20, BUN 15, creatinine 1.3, glucose 178, ionized calcium 1.22, phosphate 5.7, magnesium 2.0, albumin 2.4, arterial blood gases revealed the pH of 7.27, pCO2 46, pO2 148 on 5 liter face tent.
Serum osmolarity;  293.
Urinalysis on [**2193-7-4**] showed specific gravity greater than 1.003, pH 5.0, protein 30, RBC 3 to 5, WBC less than 1, urine sodium of 12, creatinine 90 and osmolality 484.
Creatinine kinases were 44 and 52 with cardiac troponin I less 0.3 times two.
Imaging: CT of the head on [**2193-7-4**] showed no intracranial bleeding, midline shift or skull fracture, right sided soft tissue swelling with subcutaneous emphysema.
CT of the cervical spine on [**7-4**] showed surgical screws and wires at C1 through C2.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**7-4**] showed 1.9 cm left kidney cyst, several small right kidney cysts, no fractures or signs of acute injury.
Chest x-ray on [**7-5**] revealed left basilar atelectasis, no pneumothorax, pulmonary artery catheterization correctly placed.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**7-4**] showed bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, right inferior pubic irregularities consistent with old fracture.
Chest x-ray on [**7-5**] showed interval development of mild congestive heart failure.
Chest x-ray on [**7-6**] showed retrocardiac opacification.
Vitamin supplementation and electrolyte repletion was provided by the hospitalization/substance abuse nurse specialist, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2411**]  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2412**], RN consulted and her recommendations are pending at the time of this summary.
BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA:  As noted above, the patient required a total of eight units of packed red blood cells to restore the hematocrit to greater than 30.
Retrocardiac opacification was stable on chest x-ray and felt to be consistent with resolving process.
Swallow evaluation was performed at the bedside and showed no swallow abnormalities.
On discharge, the BUN and serum creatinine were within normal limits.
PROBLEM #7:  MILD PROTEINURIA:  This was noted as an incidental finding and should be followed as an outpatient.
