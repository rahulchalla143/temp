The patient had an exercise tolerance test in [**2105-9-17**], which was positive for inferior and inferolateral reversible defects.
Echocardiogram at that time showed an ejection fraction of 30% with focal left ventricular hypokinesis and posterolateral akinesis and 1+ MR.  Over the past several weeks, the patient has had increasing dyspnea on exertion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: Temperature 97.9, blood pressure 114/58, pulse 70, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 95% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following: Significant for hematocrit of 31.0, platelet count 148,000, potassium 4.4, BUN 52, creatinine 2.5.
(baseline creatinine 1.8 to 1.9).
The INR is 3.1.
Chest x-ray:  ([**2104-12-10**]):  Increased pleural effusions bilaterally.
He underwent coronary artery catheterization on [**1-4**], which showed no significant coronary disease.
At cardiac catheterization on [**1-4**], the patient was found to have elevated left and right side filling pressures, as well as pulmonary artery hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure 59/21; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 21).
The patient will need further evaluation, especially of pulmonary disease to explain his right heart failure.
The patient would benefit from a chest CT as an outpatient and perhaps a VQ scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.7, creatinine is now stable at 2.2 to 2.5.
His creatinine should be followed closely for several days to assure that it is stable and at a new baseline.
His blood sugars were in good control.
The hematocrit remained stable following the transfusions.
The patient's INR, potassium, BUN and creatinine should be followed closely until stable.
