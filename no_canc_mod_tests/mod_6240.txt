IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process <br> CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2141-9-30**] 8:12 PM Single AP view of the chest is obtained supine on [**2141-9-30**] at [**2053**] hours and is compared with the most recent study performed the prior day.
The degree of respiratory motion in the chest makes evaluation of the lower lung fields suboptimal however there is a patchy increase in lung markings at both bases.
Recommend a repeat examination when the patient condition permits to exclude developing airspace disease at both bases.
<br> UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2141-9-30**] 3:44 AM RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed.
<br> CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2141-10-1**] 5:50 PM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-30**] and earlier on [**10-1**] symmetrical opacification in the lower lungs has developed over the past two days, due in part to small increasing bilateral pleural effusion.
<br> Head CT [**9-29**]: EAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no comparison.
The study is somewhat degraded due to motion artifact.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.

Lower extremity dopplers negative as above and heparin stopped.
There, patient received aggressive IV hydration and blood pressure improved to 110s.
Clinical exam and CXR were consistent with volume overload and pulmonary congestion.
His Cr went up (from 0.8 to a peak of 1.5).
He had a repeat TTE with the results as above (preserved systolic function with Grade I diastolic dysfunction).
4) Pneumonia, question aspiration After transfer to the floor on [**10-1**], patient had fever of 103, thick secretions, and CXR that raised question of aspiration pneumonia.
TSH, B12, Folate, RPR, head CT all checked and unremarkable as above.
He had an LP done in ED w/ unremarkable results as above.
<br> Outstanding issues: -f/u final blood culture results from [**10-1**] -repeat CXR in [**4-21**] weeks -monitor renal function with repeat chem-10 in 1 week  Medications on Admission: Lasix 80mg qd Simvastatin 40 mg qhs KCl MVI Vit B12 SC q month donepezil 5mg qhs ASA 81mg qday   Discharge Medications: 1.
