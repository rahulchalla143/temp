He has a h/o COPD(last FEV1 1.27, 41% of predicted), tracheomalicia s/p stent removal ([**1-5**]) and CAD s/p RCA stent and echo with LVEF 25-30%([**8-5**]).
He was restarted on nebs and ABG showed 7.29/65/72.
After starting BiPAP on the floor, his breathing improved and ABG 7.39/44/77.

He responded well to BiPAP with ABG 7.39/44/89.
BUN was 49 up from 38.
This was thought to be due to pre-renal etiology and his creatinine subsequently improved to 1.0 with fluid repletion.
4) CAD: Cardiac enzymes x 3 were negative with no EKG changes.
