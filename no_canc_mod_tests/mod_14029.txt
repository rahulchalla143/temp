His [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Scale was 3 initially at the scene.
At [**Hospital1 46**] his GCS was 6.
On arrival, Mr. [**Known lastname **] heart rate was 140, blood pressure was 120/palpable and his heart rate continued to climb to 160.
A diagnostic peritoneal lavage was performed which was positive by visual inspection and he was subsequently taken to the operating room urgently for an exploratory laparotomy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission his temperature was 36.0 rectally, heart rate 120-160, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 120-150/palpation, respiratory rate intubated, bagged by valve mask.
Pulse oximetry was 100%.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no crepitus.
Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, fast examination was negative.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium was 141, potassium 3.2, chloride 112, bicarbonate 22, BUN 16, creatinine 0.8, glucose 255, white blood cell count 22, hematocrit 35, platelet count 245, PTT 31, patient 15.2, INR 1.5, fibrinogen 127, lactate 4.8, amylase 59.
Arterial blood gas 7.18/61/269/24/-6.
Serum toxicology screen was negative.
Urinalysis showed large blood, 5 red blood cells.
Urine toxicology was negative except opiates were positive, that is post therapy with narcotic agents.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  Chest x-ray showed an endotracheal tube which was not visualized on the radiograph due to superior and malpositioning; nasogastric tube was coiled in the upper esophagus.
CT of the head without contrast showed two punctate areas of high density within the right frontal cortex consistent with contusion.
CT of the cervical spine showed no cervical spine fractures, fractures of the left first rib and right T1 transverse process were seen.
CAT scan of the abdomen was performed post splenectomy and showed mottled enhancement, small bowel loops and liver likely due to reflux and hyperemia after an episode of hypotension.
CT of the chest with contrast showed no evidence of aortic tear or dissection, a slight increased density to the mediastinal fat consistent with hematoma, no pericardial effusions, dense opacification of both lungs dependently.
CT of the pelvis showed the urinary bladder was collapsed.
Bone windows demonstrated fracture of the right transverse process of C1, left ribs one through six with rib five being fractured twice; the tip of L3, left transverse process fracture, fracture through the right sacrum and a nondisplaced fracture through the right superior pubic ramus.
Thoracic and lumbar spines did not demonstrate any fractures.
A repeat CAT scan on [**2125-2-13**] demonstrated three punctate areas of hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter interface with basically unchanged CAT scan.
A CT of the abdomen on [**2125-2-17**] demonstrated bilateral consolidation of the lower lobes of the lung with left greater than right, a small amount of free fluid in the gastrohepatic region but no evidence of abscess or other fluid collection.
He was subsequently taken from the Emergency Department trauma bay to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy.
Upon exploratory laparotomy several splenic lacerations were observed.
Prior to exploratory laparotomy, a second right-sided chest tube was placed for persistent pneumothorax.
The neurosurgery service was consulted at the time of operation for urgent intracranial pressure monitoring given that Mr. [**Known lastname **] did not receive a head CAT scan and had an altered mental status.
The initial intracranial pressure was 32 and declined to 23 after 50 grams of Mannitol.
After a repeat CAT scan showed no change from the original CAT scan, the [**Last Name (un) **] ICP monitor was discontinued on the evening of [**2125-2-12**].
On [**2125-2-13**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] two anterior chest tubes were discontinued and a follow-up chest x-ray showed adequate expansion of his lungs.
A follow-up chest x-ray showed adequate expansion of the lungs.
Blood cultures on [**2125-2-15**] grew out two out of four bottles, coagulase negative staphylococcus.
A sputum culture had Gram positive cocci.
A urine culture was negative.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to have a fever while on the floor as high as 102.8 and his white blood cell count rose from 11.4 to 14.
On [**2125-2-17**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a CT of his abdomen which showed no abscess and some nonspecific hyperperfusion of the right liver and also bibasilar consolidation in his lungs.
Subsequent cultures were negative, while he did have some Gram negative rods in his sputum.
Touch-down weight bearing on the right lower extremity.
