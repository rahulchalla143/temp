His family took him to [**Hospital **] Hospital Emergency Room where initial vital signs demonstrated a temperature of 101.3, heart rate of 122, blood pressure of 237/137, respirations 48, oxygenation at 81% on room air.
An electrocardiogram at that time showed a sinus tachycardia with ST depressions in leads V5 through V6 at a ventricular rate of 114.
A computerized axial tomography scan was performed and was negative for pulmonary embolus or evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis.
BMP level was drawn, not suggestive of congestive heart failure.
The patient was given intravenous fluids, given history of chronic renal insufficiency and chest x-ray demonstrating bilateral infiltrates thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
On physical examination at the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Room his vital signs were as follows, temperature 96.8, blood pressure 123/86, heart rate 83 and regular, respirations 28.
A repeat electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 83 beats/minute with no ST or T wave changes.
Question of coronary artery disease, however, normal exercise treadmill test with MIBI imaging in [**2112-5-23**], going 9.5 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol with an ejection fraction of 61% and normal perfusion of the imaging portion.
Gastrointestinal bleed, in [**2105**] with black stools, decreased hematocrit, likely secondary to increased use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for back pain.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.1.
KNOWN ALLERGIES:  Zanaflex lead to a cardiac dysrhythmia of unknown type.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.5, heart rate 80 and regular, blood pressure 139/77, respirations 25, oxygenation 93% on a nonrebreather facemask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, extraocular movements intact, pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, moist mucous membranes, no evidence of jaundice.
Extremities, 1 to 2+ pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities with dopplerable pulses bilaterally.
Neurologic examination reveals [**3-28**] motor function in all flexors and extensors.
LABORATORY DATA:  Initial data on admission revealed white blood cells 15.2 with 17% bandemia, hematocrit 30.2, platelets 246.
INR 1.4, troponin was 1.65 with a CK of 110, MB fraction of 5.
Chem-7 was as follows, 137, 4.8, 104, 21, 29, 1.3, 176 with an anion gap of 12.
Chest x-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates in all lung fields.
A computerized tomographic angiography of the chest demonstrated no filling defects in the pulmonary arteries or veins.
Evaluation of left atrium and pulmonary veins demonstrates two major pulmonary veins in both the right and left side, pulmonary vein draining the right middle lobe, draining into the inferior most right pulmonary vein.
An electrocardiogram at the time of admission demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats/minute with low QRS voltage in the limb leads.
QTC 419, normal axis.
Urine cultures and urinalysis were negative.
Sputum cultures and blood cultures were negative at the time of dictation.
with excellent urine output and marked improvement in oxygenation.
Pulmonary embolus, the patient had a computerized tomographic angiography which was negative for pulmonary embolus.
Other considerations would include intra-abdominal bleed, status post right and left heart catheterization with a mild hematocrit drop compared to his baseline and moderate intra-abdominal swelling, post procedure, however, this did not seem to be a likely cause at least at the time of the dictation.
His creatinine kinase were cycled and were negative times three.
This seemed to have good effect on both the blood pressure and the patient's pulmonary function.
He remained on Coumadin with an INR goal of 2 to 2.5 as well as Amiodarone with good effect on both rhythm and rate.
Mitral regurgitation, he had 2+ mitral regurgitation noted on echocardiogram on [**2114-3-21**] with an ejection fraction of 55%.
He was continued on Valium for muscle spasm and it should be noted that he will need a fiberoptic intubation if he is to be intubated.
Anemia, iron studies were drawn and were consistent with an anemia of chronic disease with an elevated ferritin.
His MCV was 80.
He will need an outpatient colonoscopy to work up the source for this anemia, especially given that he is on Coumadin.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition, given the aggressive diuresis, electrolytes were checked b.i.d.
