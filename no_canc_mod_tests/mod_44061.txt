Sagittal short TR, short TE spin echo imaging was performed through the brain.
Axial imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin echo, FLAIR, gradient echo, and diffusion technique.
Comparison to a head CT of [**2103-1-7**].
FINDINGS: The study is normal.
CT ABDOMEN PELVIS .
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained from lung bases to pubic symphysis after administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenously.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The visualized portion of the lung bases demonstrates consolidative changes suggesting aspiration/atelectasis.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, the uterus and adnexa, the rectum and sigmoid colon have normal appearance.
ECHO [**1-11**] .
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
In the ED, NGT was initially placed for vomiting, CKs were up, LP was negative.
CXR, CT head/abd/pelvis was unrevealing.
Viral HSV encephalitis was considered and she was treated empirically with acyclovir until negative HSV PCR studies returned.
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with normal axis & intervals, no ST-T abnormalities.
Viral HSV encephalitis was considered and she was treated empirically with acyclovir until negative HSV PCR studies returned.
She was to be monitored on the CIWA protocol for withdrawal, TSH was checked, and an MI was ruled out with serial enzymes.
Her heart rate reached 150s.
MRI was non-revealing and EEG was mildly abnormal consistent with use of benzos.
The concern for an aspiration pneumonia was discussed when patient presented in MICU with elevated temperature, decreased breath sounds, however, CXR revealed no infiltrate.
It was recommended to continue on CIWA protocol (on diazepam PRN), on MVI/thiamine/folate, and she started on Wellbutrin for smoking cessation.
Patient's mental status continued to improve and her CIWA scale reached below 7.
CIWA scale was removed and there was no longer the need for diazepam.
Echo to assess for dilated cardiomyopathy was normal.
HSV PCR returned negative and acyclovir was d/c.
