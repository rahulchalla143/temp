EKG on presentation showed ST elevation in leads V3,4, and 5.
Troponin was 12.483.

Cardiology  A. Cath ([**2193-4-26**]) ** PRELIM REPORT ** BRIEF HISTORY:   78 M presented to OSH with chest pain and [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cardiac catheterization.
An XB LAD 4.0 guiding catheter provided good support for the procedure and a Prowater wire was advanced into the distal LAD with moderate difficulty.
We then stented the mid LAD with a Promus Rx 2.5x18 mm drug-eluting stent (DES) post-dilated with an NC Quantum Apex MR 2.75x12 mm balloon inflated at 20 atm for 20 sec.
Final angiography revealed normal TIMI 3 flow in the vessel, no angiographically apparent dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the newly deployed stent but acute cut-off in distal LAD showed diffusely diseased small apical vesswel that remained unchanged despite mechanical dottering and distal NTG delivery via balloon.
The R 6Fr femoral artery sheath was removed post limited groin angiography and an Angioseal closure device was deployed without complications with distal pulses confirmed post deployment.
Emergent coronary angiography revealed a right dominant systemt.
The LMCA, LCx and RCA were all patent.
The LAD revealed a mid 95% occlusion with thrombus.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a SBP of 142 mmHg and a DBP of 80 mmHg.
Final angiography revealed normal TIMI 3 flow, no angiographically apparent dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the newly deployed stent with an abrupt cut-off in the distal LAD unchagned despite mechanical balloon dottering and distal NTG delivery via balloon.
ASA indefinitely; plavix (clopidogrel) 75 mg daily for at least 12 months for DES 5.
Integrilin gtt for 18 hours post PCI for thrombus and abrupt cut-off of distal small vessel apical LAD unchanged despite mechanical balloon dottering and distal NTG delivery via balloon  B. TTE ([**2193-4-26**]) Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
OSH ECG dated [**2193-4-26**] at 9:01 showing ?ectopic atrial rhythm, NI, leftward axis.
STE in V3, V4, and V5.

OSH ECG notable for ectopic atrial rhythm and ST elevations in V3, V4, and V5 and initial troponin 12.483 (unknown if I or T) and CK-MB 68.5.
Cardiac biomarkers indicated CK-MB 22 and cTrop 1.36.
Final angiography revealed normal TIMI 3 flow and no angiographically apparent dissection.
Cardiac biomarkers indicated CK-MB 22 and cTrop 1.36.
Post-MI ECHO indicated LVEF 35-40 % withmild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid lateral hypokinesis and distal septal/distal anterior and apical septal hypokinesis.
He was continued on an integrilin infusion for 18 hours post PCI for thrombus and abrupt cut-off of distal small vessel apical LAD unchanged despite mechanical balloon dottering and distal NTG delivery via balloon.

Outpatient Lab Work Please check Chem-7 and CBC on [**4-1**] at Dr.[**Name (NI) **] office.
You will need to take a number of medications to keep your heart healthy and make sure the stent stays open.
YOu will need to have your liver function tested with blood tests on a regular hasis on this medicine.
START taking Lisinopril to lower your blood pressure and help your heart recover from the heart attack.
