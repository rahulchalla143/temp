Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressures, with aortic systolic and diastolic pressures of 126 and 60 mm Hg, respectively.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
[**2161-7-6**] Transthoracic ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2161-7-12**] Chest CT Scan: There is mild decrease in the AP diameter of the trachea at the thoracic inlet suggestive of post intubation stenosis.
Cardiac enzymes trended downward over several days.
On [**7-6**], he underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease(see result section).
Additonal evaluation included echocardiogram which was notable for severe aortic stenosis with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation was performed.
He was intermittently transfused with PRBC to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
Echocardiogram on [**7-14**] showed an EF of 35-40%, He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of electrophysiology in 3 months.
