Echocardiogram demonstrated EF 10% (down from prior 20-25%) as well as a thickened septum thought to be consistent with amyloid.
Dopamine was continued but as his blood pressures improved, he was started back on a beta blocker and aldactone.
The decision was made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment.
EKG demonstrated an atrial rate of ~ 100, ventricular rate 70.
Two vessel CAD - 60% lesion in distal portion of the RPDA.
LCx 90% distal stenosis.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VS: T 96.1 BP 96/66 HR 72 RR 14 O2 97% on 4 L NC Wt 100 kg Gen: Obese male in mild distress.

EF ~ 10%.
TTE performed on [**7-8**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20 percent) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls and severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-3-26**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is further depressed; right ventricular contractile function is now severely depressed.
R upper extremity ultrasound performed on [**7-7**] at [**Location (un) **] was negative for DVT  R upper extremity ultrasound on [**7-11**] demonstrated: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
KUB on [**7-7**] at [**Location (un) **]: large amount of stool, mildly dilated small bowel loops which are nonspecific and probably due to ileus  CXR (from [**Location (un) **], [**7-7**]): limited study with possible tiny pleural effusions or pleural thickening CXR [**7-8**] demonstrated: The heart is enlarged.
The position of the multiple pacemaker leads is unchanged since the prior chest x-ray of [**3-12**].
CXR [**7-12**]: There is prominence of the indistinctness of pulmonary vessels with fullness of the hila, to a greater extent than before.
Patient had catheterization in [**3-12**] which demonstrated 2 vessel coronary disease (90% distal LCx stenosis, 60% distal RPDA stenosis).
Rate control was targeted with IV lopressor which was titrated up as his blood pressure tolerated, to achieve a HR 70-90bpm, and he was eventually switched to po metoprolol 25mg po TID.
INR goal is 2.0.
The patient had an EF of 10% at OSH and 20% on echo done here, and was grossly volume overloaded with total body anasarca.
Patient was determined to be in decompensated heart failure and was maintained on a milrinone drip, which was titrated up to 0.5 mcg/kg/hr and a lasix drip which was titrated up to 15mg/hr.
A repeat doppler of the RUE on [**7-11**] was negative for DVT (as above).
His HCT was 47 at the OSH but dropped gradually to 34.5 during admission.
HCT was monitored daily.
Electrolytes were monitored regularly and repleted as necessary.
Please have your INR checked every week.
Please fax INR level to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12982**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 15181**] .
