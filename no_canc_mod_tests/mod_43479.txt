* Cardiac cath - [**2141-2-7**]:  report not available * CT Abdomen/Pelvis - [**2141-2-8**] Indication:  r/o retroperitoneal bleed 1)Bibasilar atelectasis or consolidation, with small right-sided pleural effusion.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-70%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2141-2-7**], the calculated aortic valve effective orifice area is minimally increased, with mildly increased aortic regurgitation.
female with known critical aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.6 by Echo in [**5-13**]) presents with subacute dyspnea on exertion for elective aortic valvuloplasty on [**2141-2-7**].
1) AS - pt had ECHO performed prior to the catheterization/valvuloplasty on [**2-7**] demonstrating an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm2.
Repeat ECHO on [**2141-2-9**] demonstrated a slight improvement in the aortic valve area to 0.6 cm2.
2) CAD - pt continued on ASA, beta-blocker, statin, as well as being started on Plavix  3) Anemia - pt had slight decrease in hct post-procedure & was transfused 1 unit of PRBC's to maintain her hct > 30 due to her underlying CAD.
An abdominal/pelvic CT was performed to r/o a retroperitoneal bleed, which was negative.
Her hct remained stable post transfusion throughout the remainder of her stay.
