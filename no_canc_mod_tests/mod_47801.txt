Name:  [**Known lastname 32**], [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]              Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 17429**]  Admission Date:  [**2189-9-29**]     Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2155-6-30**]     Sex:  F   ADDENDUM: HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with the complaints as above including chest pain and shortness of breath: she was initially felt to have a left upper lobe and a left lower lobe thrombus of indeterminate age according to CT scan.
CT surgery consult on [**9-30**] suggested the differential diagnosis of post pericardiotomy syndrome vs pericarditis vs recurrent PE with lower lobe pneumonia.
The patient was initially anticoagulated with Heparin, however, in the face of dropping hematocrit and OB+ stool, Heparin was discontinued on [**10-3**] and the patient was transfused times two units for hematocrit drop from approximately 27.2 to 23.8.
Bronchoscopy performed on [**10-2**] showed dynamic collapse throughout with moderate amount of purulent secretions throughout the left bronchi.
Echocardiography on [**10-3**] continued to show small circumferential pericardial effusion.
A nasogastric lavage was dip positive for blood but there was no gross blood at that time.
The patient was seen by hematology and it was suggested that laboratories be sent for hypercoagulability work-up which have been negative to date, however, in light of the patient's compromised lung status, decision was made to restart anticoagulation as the patient was clinically not greatly improved.
The patient was again sent for bronchiolar alveolar lavage with transbronchial biopsy of the lingula on [**10-5**] which again showed diffuse dynamic collapse and purulent secretions form the left and now from the right upper and middle lobe as well.
On [**10-5**] intern was called to see the patient for shortness of breath, status post bronchoscopy with oxygen saturation approximately 68% on three liters, increasing only to 88% on five liters as well as tachypnea.
Follow-up chest x-ray showed improvement in the infiltrate in the right lung.
An echo was performed which was within normal limits.
Bronchial alveolar lavage is negative, tissue is negative, washings were negative as were pleural fluid and blood cultures negative at the time.
On [**10-14**] CT of the chest showed diffuse ground glass appearance in the right lung and in the focal region on the left lung which could represent the infectious process.
A  hemorrhage or diffuse alveolar damage although it was considered odd that it was less than unilateral, oxygen requirements in the MICU decreased with diuresis in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient on [**10-14**] required only 50% Venti Mask and oxygen saturation of 96 and was transferred back to the floor.
The patient was continued on Heparin as well as Coumadin for presumed coagulopathy although again it should be noted that today these, including anti-thrombin III, protein C and factor 5 leiden were negative.
Pulmonary re-consult suggested the possibility of "trapped lung" regarding her left lower lobe collapse and felt thoracic surgery should reconsult re: possible surgical decortication.
They want to f/u with pt as outpatient in several weeks and she is to have repeat chest ct to re-assess.
