ERCP or MRCP can be performed if further evaluation is needed.
Unfortunately an ERCP could not be done because he had a platelet count of 9 at admission.
Platelets at OSH were in the 250s and here, one day later, down to 9 -> seems less c/w HIT.
ARF:  Cr of 1.3 per OSH reports, but 2.1 on initial presentation.
Urine lytes c/w this.
I explained to the pt that an ERCp could not be done because of the risks associated with his low platelet counts and that an MRCP could not be done because of his pacemaker.
