The blood type was O negative and Coombs negative.
The serum bilirubin on [**2122-10-9**] was 19, total over 0.6 mg per dL, repeated on [**10-10**] the values were the same.
On [**2122-10-11**], the serum bilirubin was a total of 22.2 mg per dL/ 0.7 mg per dL.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA: RESPIRATORY:  [**Doctor First Name **] was noted upon admission to have oxygen saturations in the 80% range.
Chest x-ray showed mildly decreased lung volumes.
At the time of discharge she is breathing comfortably in room air with respiratory rate of 30 to 50 breaths per minute with oxygen saturations greater than 98%.
CARDIOVASCULAR: [**Doctor First Name **] maintained normal heart rates and blood pressures.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: [**Doctor First Name **] continued to ad lib breast feed throughout her neonatal intensive care unit admission.
Serum electrolytes were checked twice during admission and were within normal limits.

The hematology service from [**Hospital3 **] was consulted and multiple screening labs were suggested.
Her hematocrit on the day of discharge was 39.1%.
The smear was suggestive of the infantile pyknocytosis.
Outstanding lab tests at the time of discharge include tests for G6PD, an incubated osmotic fragility test, and a hemoglobin electrophoresis was also sent.
The phototherapy was discontinued and a rebound bilirubin was 10.5/0.4 on the day of discharge.
