She was found to be septic with positive blood cultures for E. Coli and found to have large 13 cm splenic abscess on imaging.
Patient underwent CT guided drainage of the abscess and a JP drain was placed.
Final culture data showed E coli.
Last blood culture was positive on [**2174-5-2**].
She underwent a TTE which was within normal limits and showed no evidence of endocarditis.
IR recommended the drain be flushed with 5-10cc saline Q8H and remain in place until the daily net drainage is less than 15cc per day (subtracting the flushes), at which time she will need a repeat CT.
# Hyponatremia - Patient was found to have a sodium of 125 on admission which corrected to 135 and therefore was thought to have been from pseudohyponatremia.
We continued to monitor her sodium which returned to [**Location 213**] at discharge.
# Elevated Alk Phos - Patient had an elevated alk phos to 266 on admission that trended to 411, with ALT and AST of 86.
RUQ exam was unremarkable.
GGT was obtained which was also elevated suggesting that alk phos was hepatic in origin.
CT did not show any liver pathology.
At that point please reimage with a CT and insure there is no fluid remaining.
If CT shows complete resolution of the abscess, the drain may be removed with no further follow up.
Continue IV antibiotics until [**6-3**] with ertapenem 1gm Q24H.
Check CBC with diff, BMP, LFTs each week after discharge and fax the results to the [**Hospital **] clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**].
Information was obtained from Patient.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with high blood sugars and were found to have a splenic abscess.
We had trouble controlling your blood pressure since the infection had spread to your blood and transfered you to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.
Radiology drained the abscess and placed a JP drain which will continue to drain fluids.
Once the output is less than 10-15ml per day, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 357**] get a CT exam the morning prior to the visit to verify complete resolution.
Please have your liver tests checked by your primary care physician at your next appointment.
We monitored your blood sugar and other electrolytes frequently throughout the day.
Your CT exam had two findings that you will need to follow up as an outpatient.
The CT showed a thickened endometrial stripe and you will need to get a transvaginal ultrasound.
The CT also showed a pancreatic cyst and you will require a MRCP for further evaluation.
