CT showed occipital hematoma from fall with likely contracoup left frontal subdural hematoma and contusion, also small subarachnoid.
Pertinent Results: [**Known lastname 58154**],[**Known firstname **]: [**Hospital1 18**] Neurophysiology Detail - CCC Record #[**Numeric Identifier 58155**]  04-1819D - CCC REPORT APPROVED DATE:[**2162-7-21**] TEST DATE: [**2162-7-20**] INTERPRETED BY: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] L.  FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY#1: The background rhythm is low voltage.
This delta frequency slowing appears synchronous with the cardiac monitor and may reflect a pulse artifact.
HYPERVENTILATION: Was not performed due to the patient's clinical condition.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 108 beats per minute.
A delta frequency background rhythm is also present and may reflect a pulsation artifact.
Painful stimulation during the recording did not alter the background rhythm.
However, CT imaging determined that extensive severe anoxic brain injury had occurred.
Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular fibrillation leading to severe anoxic brain injury.
