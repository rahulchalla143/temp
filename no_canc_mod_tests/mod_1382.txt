Per [**Hospital1 1516**] admission note, patient reports that since his last lead extraction and revision on [**2-26**] for a fractured RV lead, he has been having chest pain, described as a stinging sensation in his chest wall.
Fluid boluses were given and bedside ultrasound performed which was concerning for large effusion and RV collapse.
Cardiology was consulted and a STAT echo was performed, which confirmed a large effusion but did not find evidence of tamponade with a pulsus of 8.
His blood pressure improved with fluids and he was admitted to cardiology for further evaluation.
Physical Exam: VS - 97.8 120/70 55 16 96% RA Pulsus 8mmHg Gen: WDWN middle aged male in NAD.
Neck: Supple with JVP of approximately 20cm at 60 degrees.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: [**2150-4-4**] 12:20AM BLOOD WBC-11.0# RBC-4.27* Hgb-12.7* Hct-39.3* MCV-92 MCH-29.9 MCHC-32.4 RDW-14.3 Plt Ct-212 [**2150-4-4**] 07:40AM BLOOD PT-12.7 PTT-25.8 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2150-4-4**] 12:20AM BLOOD Glucose-138* UreaN-42* Creat-1.5* Na-139 K-4.5 Cl-103 HCO3-26 AnGap-15 [**2150-4-4**] 12:20AM BLOOD CK-MB-3 [**2150-4-4**] 12:20AM BLOOD cTropnT-<0.01 [**2150-4-4**] 12:20AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-110 [**2150-4-4**] 07:40AM BLOOD Calcium-8.9 Phos-3.9 Mg-2.1  CXR PA/LAT [**2150-4-4**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
TTE [**2150-4-4**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the prior intraoperative TEE study (images reviewed) of [**2150-2-26**], the pericardial effusion is new and c/w tamponade physiology.
CARDIAC CATH [**2150-4-4**]: 1.
TTE [**2150-4-4**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-4-4**], the pericardial fluid is now drained.
TTE [**2150-4-6**]:  Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-4-4**], no change post drainage.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2150-4-4**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):       A swab is not the optimal specimen collection to evaluate body       fluids.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: There was no evidence of pericardial effusion on prior ECHO on [**2150-2-26**].
Repeat echo taken after fluid given is probable the reason why RV collapse is gone.
The patient went to the cath lab on [**2150-4-4**] in which a RHC revealed equalization of pressures of the pericardial and right heart pressures to 22mmHg prior to pericardiocentesis.
Pericardial pressure was 20mmHg.
The patient underwent a pericardiocentesis the following morning whereby 400cc of sanguinous fluid was drained.
Post procedure pericardial pressure was 0-2mmHg and post-procedure echo revealed resolution of the pericardial effusion.
Pericardial fluid studies were negative for bacterial growth and AFB.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine 1.5 on admission from baseline of 1.0, likely in setting of hypoperfusion, volume depletion, and NSAID use.
Creatinine impoved with hydration and was 0.9 at the time of discharge.
This was drained by a needle (pericardiocentesis) followed by a drain, and you had serial echocardiograms (ultrasounds of your heart) to make sure the fluid went away.
You also underwent cardiac catheterization.
