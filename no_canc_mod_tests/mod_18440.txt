Admission Date:  [**2189-11-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-12-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-5-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: Tx from OSH for Anterolateral [**First Name3 (LF) **]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary catheterization   History of Present Illness: 81 yo male with h/o CABG x 2 (SVG jump graft to distal RCA and circumflex and LIMA-LAD), PPM, ICD, CHF with EF 20% transferred from OSH for anterolateral [**First Name3 (LF) **].
The patient's CK 364 and Trop 3.86.
His vitals at transfer were BP 112/65, HR 86, 98% 2LNC .
The patient had a LHC which showed LAD 100%, LCX 100%, RCA 100%, SVG- diagonal 99% mid stenosis.
C.I was 1.55 then 1.46 post intervention.
Past Medical History: # CAD s/p CABG x 2 ([**2160**], [**2177**]) (SVG jump graft to distal RCA and circumflex and LIMA-LAD) # CHF with EF 20% s/p ICD/PPM placement ([**8-31**]) # Diabetes  Social History: Patient has never been a smoker and drinks ETOH only occasionally.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.9, BP 126/59 , HR 90, RR 24, O2 95% on 6.0L NC Gen: elderly male in in mild to moderate respiratory distress.
mild dry mucous membranes Neck: Supple with JVP of 14 cm (to ear).
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
EKG [**2189-11-26**] at OSH demonstrated NSR with TWI in I and aVL.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2189-11-26**] demonstrated: Coronary Angiography: Codominant LMCA: LAD: 100% origin LCX: 100% proximal RCA: 100% proximal SVG- jump graft to distal RCA and circumflex widely patent, vein to diagonal with 99% mid stenosis LIMA-LAD: atretic and not clear if used as conduit .
TTE ([**2189-11-27**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
CXR ([**2189-11-1**]): Comparison is made with prior study dated [**2189-11-27**].
CXR ([**2189-11-2**]):COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of [**2189-12-2**].
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  These are submitted as three images.
Urine cytology ([**11-26**]):Rare highly atypical but degenerated urothelial cells, cannot exclude urothelial dysplasia versus neoplasia.
Anucleate squames, histiocytes, casts and numerous red blood cells.
His vitals at transfer were BP 112/65, HR 86, 98% 2LNC.
When arriving pt was taken straight to cath lab and had a LHC which showed LAD 100%, LCX 100%, RCA 100%, SVG- diagonal 99% mid stenosis.
C.I was 1.55 then 1.46 post intervention.
Then after 2-3 days BB was started and uptitrated as blood pressure tolerated.
CXR revealed bil pleural effusions and a loculated collection on the L but pt was on room air and with good O2 sats on the floor.
Echo revealed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity enlargement/aneurysm and extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Compared to his previous echo reports this was not thought to be a significant change.
On [**12-3**] pt's INR was 1.7.
In addition, pt was kept on heparin sq while INR was subtherpeutic for DVT prophylaxis, but when INR >2, this can be discontinued.
Since pt was started on warfarin pt was felt to be a increased bleeding risk; the plan was therefore to keep [**First Name3 (LF) 4532**] 75 for a total minimum of [**3-1**] weeks, then discontinue, low dose [**Date Range **] 81mg in order to minimize adverse bleeding events.
Echo as above.
CK peaked at 853. .
As the BB was uptitrated pt spent more and more time in NSR and the rate came down from 120s to 80s and mostly NSR prior to d/c.
The recommended at follow-up CXR in [**2-28**] weeks or if symptoms (SOB or fevers) occur in the interval period then a CXR +/- CT scan should be done.
Cytology was sent wih results of "Rare highly atypical but degenerated urothelial cells, cannot exclude urothelial dysplasia versus neoplasia.
Anucleate squames, histiocytes, casts and numerous red blood cells."
Please take your medications as prescribed: - Please stop taking imdur - please take atorvastatin 80mg daily and ezetimibe 10mg daily inctead of vytorin - please start taking coumadin, and follow up in coumadin clinic as well as with your PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] take [**Name10 (NameIs) 4532**] (clopidogrel) for a minimum of 4 weeks; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will instruct you as to when to stop taking this medication - please take Aspriin, lasix, toprol and quinapril as previously directed If you develop chest pain, jaw pain, or chest pressure with pain  radiating into arm, or if you for any reason become concerned about your medical condition please call 911 or present to nearest ED.
[**Last Name (STitle) 12982**] INR and UA checked with nurse on same date  Recommend repeat urine cytology for atypical cells on Urine microscopy on admission.
Recommend Chest X-ray for repeat imaging of loculate pleural effusion at next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
