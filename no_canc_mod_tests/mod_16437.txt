The patient was initially with a sodium of 127, potassium of 2.1, creatinine of 2.3 and a total bilirubin of 18.5.
Albumin was noted at 2.8 and INR of 1.55.
The patient had an abdominal ultrasound on [**9-4**] showing fatty infiltration of the liver and mild splenomegaly.
White blood cell count was shown to be 76 and cultures were positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
The patient had a hepatic panel showing negative for hepatitis A, B or C.  The patient was given lactulose for changes in mental status.
Initial hematocrit was 37.0, however, patient had persistently heme positive stools.
Mental status improved throughout the initial hospital course and creatinine decreased to 1.0.
A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis on [**9-11**] showed a small scarred liver, diffuse abdominal ascites and unremarkable spleen.
The patient with a persistently increased creatinine of 3.0 to 3.6 which was felt secondary to hypovolemia and not hepatorenal syndrome.
LABORATORY:  Relevant laboratory values:  Peritoneal fluid showed white blood cell count of 645, red blood cells of 75, 39% polys, total PMNs of 260.
Albumin was 1.0, glucose 162, total protein 1.9.
SAAG was greater than 1.1, which is consistent with portal hypertension.
Bilirubin on admission was 22.6 which had decreased to 11.2 at the time of discharge, and trending down.
Creatinine 3.6, decreased to 1.3 and 1.4, stable.
Hematocrit was stable at 36.0.
Due to poor synthetic liver function, the patient's PT and PTT were 15.9 and 40.3 with an INR of 1.7.
Blood cultures remained negative.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy as above showed nonbleeding ulcers.
This fluid was positive for SBP with PMNs greater than 260.
Albumin was repleted.
As the patient's creatinine became stable, the patient was started on diuretics (Aldactone and Lasix), and renal function on discharge was stable to 1.3 to 1.4.
Total bilirubin was monitored daily and was found to be decreasing from initially 23.0 down to 11.0.
LUMBAR COMPRESSION FRACTURE: The patient was seen to have a compression fracture of L2 and L4 with a burst type compression fracture at L4 causing 25% spinal stenosis.
A thoracolumbar spine brace was constructed for the patient.
Deep tendon reflex were intact.
RENAL:  Creatinine improved to approximately 1.3 to 1.4; creatinine remained stable at this level for approximately one week.
HYPONATREMIA:  The patient's urine sodium decreased to 126, however, this improved on a 1.5 liter fluid restriction thought to be due to the patient's poor nutritional status.
