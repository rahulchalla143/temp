Work-up included EGD which demonstrated duodenal angioectasias, Schatski's ring and duodenitis and portal gastropathy.
A colonoscopy had been performed which was significant for large internal hemorrhoids without stigmata of recent bleedng.
She did have a colonoscopy in [**1-16**] which demonstrated sigmoid diverticulosis.

CXR [**2166-6-6**] IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure with new small right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
CT [**6-6**] IMPRESSION: 1.
[**6-10**] CXR IMPRESSION: Decreasing right lung base atelectasis and smaller right pleural effusion   Brief Hospital Course: In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient received an additional 1unit FFP, and 2 units PRBC (last [**6-4**] at 2 p.m.) with HCT 22,8 -> 24.6.
Surgery was consulted, and she underwent an EUA, rigid sigmoidoscopy, and ligation of bleeding internal hemorrhoids on [**2166-6-4**].
She does have multiple other possible sources of UGI bleeding (portal gastropathy, duodenitis, and duodenal ectasias), however, these are unlikely contributors to current presentation, given (-) NG lavage in ED.
She was transfused 1 unit PRBC on [**6-5**] with good response in hematocrit to 30.
Her hematocrit will need to be monitored closely as an outpatient to ensure stability.
Given concern for possible perforation (recent hemorrhoidal ligation), inflammatory process/abscess, or biliary obstruction (as Tbili was 2.1, elevated from baseline), a CT abd/pelvis was obtained [**6-6**] which showed....
She was discharged on cefpodoxime, with a total course of 14 days from positive blood cultures.
Workup included CXR and UA/Urine culture, all of which were negative.
Fever resolved and the patient was discharged on a total of 14 days of antibiotics starting from day of positive blood cultures for E.coli bacteremia.
# NSVT: As mentioned above, the patient had one 16 beat run of NSVT [**6-4**] while in the ICU a transthoracic echocardiogram [**6-5**] showed LVEF >55%, 1+ AR, 1+ MR, 1+ TR, mild PA sys HTN, trivial physiologic pericardial effusion.
An outpatient holter may be pursued at the discretion of her primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] function tests were obtained, which showed a high normal TSH and a mildly elevated free T4 at 1.8 (normal 0.9-1.7).
There was no evidence on clinical exam of fluid overload.
A CXR PA was obtained [**6-6**] which showed mild CHF and new right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
Her oxygen was titrated down and, at discharge, ambulatory sats were stable.
Please follow-up with your primary care physician or come to the emergency room if you develop rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, or other symptoms that concern you.
