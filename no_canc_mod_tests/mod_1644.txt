His CXR and clinical status continued to improve and he was able to be weaned off the vent for intermittent periods of time with close attention to his ABGs.
As well, he will need a downsizing of his trach to a 6 before ENT re-eval for Passy-Muir valve fitting.
They noted that no Passy-Muir valve should be placed without prior evaluation of his vocal chords by ENT.
He was pan cultured several times and the culture data was notable for the folowing: [**8-13**] Blood 1/4 + corynebacterium and [**8-31**] [**2-2**] blood cultures + for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10577**]; [**8-17**] Gram stains revealed sputum 1+ GPCs.
At time of discharge, CXR showed resolution of PNA.
He is to complete a 21 day course with LFTs being checked Qweek.
His baseline AST was 46 ALT was 29.
A RUQ US was done to evaluate for biliary obstruction, and was negative.
As well, his GGT/alk phos were found to be trending down from prior levels and were actually lower after initiation of voriconazole than prior to starting the antibiotic.
Ophthalmologic evaluation showed no endophthalmitis and TEE was negative for vegetations.
He was started on a 14 day course of Flagyl [**9-5**] and his [**9-6**] culture subsequently was negative.
Per neuro recs, propofol and versed were held; options for treatment included etomidate, geodon, or fentanyl, none of which were required as his agitation improved on initiation of ambisome.
A head CT was obtained to evaluate for intracranial bleed, and was negative.
His blood sugars were well controlled on this regimen.
Per nutrition recommendations, tube feeds are to be held for residuals >100.
