An ultrasound done as an outpatient showed an endometrial stripe of 12 mm and normal ovaries.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease, CHF with a ejection fraction of 55% on a [**2192-3-28**] echo, insulin dependent diabetes, atypical chest pain with a negative work up and a negative MIBI on [**2192-3-28**], asthma, sleep apnea, anemia, lower extremity edema, GERD, and a PE in [**2188-9-28**] requiring 12 months of Coumadin anticoagulation, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, migraines, colon polyps, depression, hypercholesterolemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted on [**11-20**] for an outpatient procedure of a dilation and curettage for postmenopausal bleeding.
The hysteroscopy portion was aborted and the patient was too unstable to extubate, although intraoperative chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema that was thought to be due to her CHF.
A chest x-ray done 4 hours after the initial chest x-ray done intraoperatively showed improvement of the pulmonary edema after IV Lasix.
Cardiac: Given the flash pulmonary edema, cardiac enzymes were cycled x3 and were all negative for any evidence of a troponin leak.
An EKG was noted to have a right bundle branch block, but had been noted at a preoperative EKG.
Her blood pressure ranged in the less than 120's to 202/60's to 80's.
Diabetes: She was started on a regular insulin sliding scale with adequate control of her sugars in the 200's.
However, as noted, the chest x-ray that was done after diuresis did not show any evidence of infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia.
Postoperative fever: She spiked to 101.3 on postoperative day #0, and given the chest x-ray with no evidence of infiltrates beyond pulmonary edema, as well as a negative UA, it was felt this was most likely consistent with endometritis.
