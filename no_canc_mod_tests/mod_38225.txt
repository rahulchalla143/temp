At [**Hospital3 **] his EKG revealed ST elevations of II, III and aVF, and ST depressions of I, aVL and V2-V6.
After re-perfussion he became bradycardic (HR 60) and hypotensive (BP 95/62).
These were quickly stopped as the patient's BP and HR stabilized.

Admission EKG [**2121-1-24**]:  Baseline artifact.
Cardiac Cath [**2121-1-24**]: 1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed 1 vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressure of 149/90mmHg.
Final angiogram showed TIMI3 flow, no dissection and 0%  residual stenosis in the stent.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
This was likely due to Bezold-Jarish reflex post-reperfusion of the inferior wall.
His pressors were quickly weaned and did not require further BP support on admission.
His follow up echo was significant for mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior hypokinesis, and should be reevaluated in [**1-19**] months as an outpatient.
He was set up with PCP follow up for further evaluation of this.
Your echocardiogram showed that your heart is weakened by the heart attack.
Your new cardiologist will perform another echocardiogram in about [**1-19**] months to check the heart function and will recommend that you go to cardiac rehabilitation after that.
