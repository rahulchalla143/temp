His home spO2 was in the high 80's and he reports his systolic blood pressures were in the 130's, which is slightly lower than usual.
He had been told to discontinue his Lisinopril, which he has.
CXR was obtained.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-10-7**], the findings are similar.
The absence of valvular vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not preclude their presence.
If clinical suspicion for endocarditis is high a transesophageal echocardiogram may be considered.
[**2190-12-16**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN - Suboptimal exam, but no bowel dilatation or free air.
[**2190-12-17**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Right upper lobe pneumonia continues to develop.
[**2190-12-21**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - Moderately severe, but improving pulmonary edema, and stable small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
[**2190-12-21**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS B - No vascular flow identified in the mid-to-distal portion of one of the left peroneal veins in the left calf.
# RECURRENT, LOW-GRADE FEVERS - The patient had concern for pneumonia given his dyspnea and CXR findings, and was initially covered broadly for HCAP given his immunosuppression and recent hospitalization, completing an 8-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin and Meropenem).
However, the etiology of his dyspnea was attributed partially to volume overload given his elevation in BNP and volume overload on clinical exam and imaging.
Blood, urine, legionella antigen were all negative.
His WBC remained normalized and without evidence of leukocytosis.
A 2D Echo earlier in his hospitalization was without vegetations.
Inflammatory causes were considered and his ESR and CRP were slightly elevated, but he had no evidence of joint swelling, erythema, gouty arthritis.
We performed bilateral lower extremity U/S which showed no clot burden, but one of the deep peroneal left-sided veins was not well visualized.
Fungal infections were considered and B-glucan and galactomannan were negative for invasive fungemia.
A chest CT was eventually performed prior to discharge and showed moderately severe, but improving pulmonary edema with RUL consolidation that could be his prior pneumonia - although he had completed his antibiotic course.
CXR showing new opacity in the RML.
A component of CHF exacerbation was also treated given his pulmonary effusion, oxygen requirement and BNP (29,000) on admission - with response to diuresis.
Of note, he had some evidence of demand ischemia with cardiac biomarkers (Troponin) peaking at 0.09.
His glucose remained in the 150-300 mg/dL range.
He was admitted with a creatinine of 2.0.
His immune suppression regimen was continued, but his Tacrolimus was dropped from 4 mg to 3 mg in the QAM, but his evening dose of Tacrolimus 3 mg PO QHS was maintained.
His Tacrolimus levels were reassuring overall.
He also had evidence of a normocytic anemia of chronic disease related to his ESRD which was stable this admission.
2D-Echo showing LVEF > 55%, preserved LV function, moderate pulmonary HTN.
At the time of discharge, respiratory viral screen, blood and urine cultures from admission were still pending.
