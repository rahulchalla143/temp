She underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed 60% distal left main lesion, 80% stenosis of the left anterior descending, totally occluded circumflex and 80% stenosis of the right coronary artery.
LV gram was notable for an LVEF of 40%.

Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).

Preoperative workup was otherwise uneventful and she was cleared for surgery.
IV Amiodarone was changed to po dosing and her rhythm  converted to sinus.
Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation and treatment resumed.
