PATHOLOGY: [**2139-3-10**] LIVER CORE BX (1 JAR) 1.
Trichrome stain evaluated and also shows focal sinusoidal fibrosis.
Additional levels and reticulum stain examined.
CYTOLOGY [**2139-3-15**] Peritoneal Fluid:  	NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
IMAGING [**2139-3-11**] CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: CT CHEST: There is a large right hemothorax with collapse of the right lowerand middle lobes.
CT ABDOMEN: The liver is nodular in contour consistent with known cirrhosis.
The portal, hepatic, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins remain patent.
CT PELVIS: The appendix is somewhat prominent but is unchanged in appearance over multiple prior studies.
This suggested a widespread encephalopathy, and the faster activity raised the possibility that some of this was due to medications.
Ventilator Associated Pneumonia:  On admission to the ICU the patient was noted to have sputum culture growing H.Influenzae.
By day 2 of his antibiotics he was breathing well on room air.
Acute Renal Failure - The patient's creatinine increased to 1.3 from baseline of 0.6, likely due to pre-renal causes.
His Cr was 1.1 and will require follow up as an outpatient.
His last EGD was [**2136**].
Liver Lesions: The IR guided biopsy showed no evidence of malignancy.
The patient will need surveillance MRI in 3 months time.
