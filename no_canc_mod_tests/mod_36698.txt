CXR ([**2125-4-7**]): Diffuse bilateral airspace and interstitial opacities with increased reticulation primarily in the upper lungs.
CT Chest ([**2125-4-9**]): Extensive interstitial lung disease in both lungs.
Pulmonary artery measures 34 mm and suggests presence of pulmonary hypertension.
TTE ([**2125-4-10**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CTA Chest ([**2125-4-11**]): 1.
Ultrasound is suggested for further evaluation if not already done.
CXR ([**2125-4-15**]): No significant interval change in diffuse parenchymal abnormalities and cardiomediastinal contour was demonstrated.
An echo documented diastolic heart failure and the patient was diuresed to being a total of 6 liters negative for length of stay.
A CTA chest revealed no PE.
An in-depth conversation was held with the patient's son and HCP who expressed the desire to make his mother comfortable and move to a goal of no further hospitalizations.
Thus, no further intervention was made and patient was maintained on oxygen, tolerating an oxygen saturation as low as 88-93%.
# Atrial flutter/Diastolic Heart Failure: Given documentation of diastolic heart failure, EP was consulted to decrease the patient's pacemaker rate and allow for better diastolic filling.
