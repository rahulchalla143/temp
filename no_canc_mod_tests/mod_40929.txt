His EKG showed STD in I, II, aVL, AVF, V2-V5 as well as STE in AVR.
His troponin was elevated at 0.12, Ck MB 11.
His EKG changes improved with better rate control.
Chest x-ray showed multifocal pneumonia, so he was started on antibiotics for HCAP coverage.
He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2183-1-22**] which showed occlusion of the severely diseased LMCA that supplied a diffusely diseased OM1 that measured previously 0.5 mm and a small (0.75 mm) diagonal system.
At 03:30 am on [**2183-1-23**] he flipped into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (heart rate 130s to 140s), with rate related ST-depressions.
SBP trended back up to the low 100s in about 15 minutes.
His HR went down to 100-110s, and BP was down to 80s/60s, with MAPs in low 60s.

I/O: 24hr: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18904**] 8Hr: 100/575 WEight: 76.8 (77.4) .
sl dry MM NECK: Supple with JVP of 9 cm.
PULSES: Right: DP 1+ PT 2+ Left: DP 1+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: TTE [**2184-1-22**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Cardiac cath showed [**2184-1-22**] Cardiac Catheterisation [**2184-1-22**] .
Distal Cx and OM2 vessel fills via the LIMA and has minimal disease.
RCA:  Occluded proximally and distally fills via collaterals from the LCA via the LIMA graft and SVG to LAD graft SVG-RCA:  Known occluded SVG to LAD:  Widely patent.
CARDIAC CATH: [**2181**] 1.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow.
CXR [**2184-1-22**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is evidence of a newly appeared parenchymal opacity at both the right lung base and in the left lung, notably in the perihilar areas in the retrocardiac space.
CTA chest [**2184-1-23**] FINDINGS: Sternal wires and post CABG changes are present.
Evaluation of the lung parenchyma is somewhat limited due to extensive respiratory motion.
#L4/L5 laminectomy: Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service and taken to the Operating Room for the above procedure.
Cardiac cath at that time showed infarction appeared to be occlusion of the severely diseased LMCA that supplied a diffusely diseased OM1 that measured previously 0.5 mm and a small (0.75 mm) diagonal system.
K had just been repleted (was at 3.8) ECG showed NSR at 100 (had been in 80s earlier in the night - on tele sped up slowly, in sinus) new 1mm depression in lead I, avF with 2mm dep in lead II.
Repeat ECG showed resolution of changes mentioned above but pt now with inverted T waves V1 V2 V3, NSR at rate 80.
V4 and V5 with 2mm depressions V6 with only 1mm dep now.
BP maintained at low 100s/60s throughout, O2 sat 96 on 2L nc.
Cardiac catheterization images revisited and it was felt that pt did not have any visible occlusions to intervene on, in which case CABG was also not an option.
On [**2184-1-23**] pt went into Afib with HR in 110s, SBP 90s-100s, 3 hours later back into sinus tack, then an hour later with RVR 140-150s, dilt gtt started.
Apart from [**Name (NI) 7792**], pt also had fevers, leukocytosis, and CXR findings concerning for ?pneumonia on transfer to the CCU.
On day of discharge, INR was 2.0 - initiation of metoprolol to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control - initiation of warfarin for anticoagulation  # CAD: Patient has known CAD, s/p CABG and occluded SVG-RCA.
s/p Echo which showed no new wall motion abnormalities, EF 45% at baseline, s/p cardiac catheterisation which showed OM1 lesion.
- optimize medical management for CAD: ASA 325mg, initiation of bblocker, statin - if renal function stabilzes, please consider initiation of ACEI  #fevers/leukocytosis: On transfer to CCU pt had fevers, leukocytosis>16, CXR findings suggestive of multifocal pneumonia.
Blood and sputum cx showed no growth.
There was also c/f PE; pt with history of unprovoked PE in [**Month (only) 547**] [**2183**], no hypercoagulability workup done at the time.
CXR changes however thought to be more consistent with pneumonia.
# Hct drop: Hct drop to nadir 23.4 from 32.1 on [**2184-1-22**], pt is s/p laminectomy.
Patient reported his last colonoscopy 10 years ago, due for a followup colonoscopy in [**Month (only) 956**], of note his mother died of colon CA at age 63.
Echo done at bedside showing preserved EF but mitral regurg worsened.
BP improved with control of Afib and aggressive diuresis.
#abdominal distension - pt was noted to lack bowel sounds and was with distended abdomen after laminectomy.
KUB showed ileus but no evidence of obstruction and exam was otherwise benign.
#Emesis - pt developed several episodes of watery, nonbloody nonbilious emesis.
