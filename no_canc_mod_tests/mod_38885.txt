Ceftriaxone was continued for SBP diagnosed at [**Hospital1 2025**] x5 days and albumin.
Therapeutic tap was done on [**9-7**] which showed resolution of SBP.
Diuretics were held as creatinine was up to 1.5 from baseline of 0.9.
Cr increased to 3.5 on 2nd hospital day.
Paracentesis showed no SBP.
Liver duplex showed patent vasculature, no ductal dilatation or perihepatic collections.
On [**2165-9-17**], he was acutely anemic with orthostasis and hematocrit of 15.7.
Blood was noted in the stomach and jejunum.
On [**2165-9-18**], WBC increased to 60K.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.
CT chest showed no pneumonia.
Hematocrit stabilized and there was no further evidence of bleeding.
CXR found little interval change, and nuclear lung scan showed low likelihood of PE.
IV fluid boluses were given and a unit of PRBC were administered on [**9-28**] for HCT of 25.2.
JP outputs continued to be high 3500cc per day (ascitic).
Creatinine increased to 6.5 on [**10-1**] due to creatinine increase to 2.4 from 1.7.
Creatinine increased further to 2.6, but then trended down daily with lower Prograf doses.

Cell count was indicative of peritonitis with 1350 WBC with 88 polys.
Cell count had 268 WBCs and 59 polys.
Culture was pending.
Ceftriaxone was switched to Ciprofloxacin on [**10-10**] for SBP prophylaxis indefinitely ([**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital1 1326**] MD to re-assess in outpatient f/u).
He felt better, vital signs were stable.
HCT was noted to have dropped from 27 to 23 on [**10-7**].
