Cardiovascular - The patient was admitted to CCU for blood pressure control.
He was started on Labetalol drip which resulted in immediate significant drop in his blood pressure requiring discontinuation of the Labetalol.
Following this, he was started on Nipride drip with relatively good control, but over the first 24 hours, his blood pressure returned to [**Location 213**] and all drips were subsequently discontinued.
