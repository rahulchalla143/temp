He then had a head CT which shows an ~20 cc ICH in the right corona radiata of the frontal lobe, with extension into the deep temporal lobe and a question of baseal ganglia involvement.
He is on coumadin and his INR was initially 2.8.
Repeat head CT showed severe worsening with blood in all ventricles.
CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally .
+gag reflex .
Does have occ spontaneous movement to light touch or no touch with arm extension and knee/ankle movement.
Sensation: Withdraws legs to stim vs reflex reaction.

CT head: IMPRESSION: Large right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, likely centered at the basal ganglia, with subfalcian and transtentorial herniation.
The fact that his INR was in the high 2 range probably caused the bleed to worsen significantly.
However, his INR was still 1.9 when he arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] for which he received additional FFP.
