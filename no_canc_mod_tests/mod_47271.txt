The white blood cell count was 15.2; which was up from a prior value of 10.
The reason for this was investigated with a computed tomography scan of the abdomen.
This study demonstrated multiple peripancreatic fluid collections which were felt to be abscess cavities.
The patient's white blood cell count reached a maximum value of 20; although the patient was afebrile.
A pigtail catheter was placed in this fluid collection and cultures were sent.
His white blood cell count diminished from 20 down to 11.6 at the time of discharge, and he was discharged to the rehabilitation facility on oral antibiotics.
