The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further care.
Her cardiac enzymes were negative for evidence of myocardial ischemia.
The patient had had a CT scan performed at the outside hospital which showed unchanged dissection with poor flow in the false lumen.
The patient underwent an ETT which was negative for any symptoms of pain and the thallium images were negative for evidence of ischemia.
The patient underwent a CT angiogram which suggested extravasation of the dye from the false lumen to the left lung apical hematoma.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory which showed two to three plus aortic insufficiency, aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta, both aortic valves, no clear location of dye extravasation of evidence of proximal retrograde dissection.
The patient was started on intravenous nitroprusside to maintain systolic blood pressure less than 110.
The patient underwent an MRI / MRA of the chest to further evaluate the aorta.
The MRI showed evidence of periaortic hemorrhage around the ascending aortic graft with signal intensity suggestive of subacute hemorrhage less than ten days old.
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit for strict blood pressure control.
During the operation, the patient had an episode of hemoptysis and postoperatively the patient's chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate which was felt to be due to a rupture of the pseudoaneurysm and to the left upper lobe.
On postoperative day number three, the patient was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 76.
Heparin dependent antibodies were sent which were subsequently positive.
