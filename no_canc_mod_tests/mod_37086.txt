Her arterial blood gases in the MICU revealed hypercapnia and acidosis.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 5.9, hematocrit 29.6, platelet count 288,000, PT 13.2 with INR 1.2, PTT 29, sodium 149, potassium 6.6, hemolyzed, chloride 117, CO2 23, BUN 120, creatinine 6 .5.
Repeat potassium was 4.6.
She also had calcium of 9.7, phosphorus 3.8 and magnesium 2.3.
ALT was 8, AST 8, alkaline phosphatase 90 and total bilirubin .7.
Latest arterial blood gas showed PH 7.17, PCO2 62, PO2 142.
We therefore obtained an ultrasound of her lower extremities to evaluate the possibility of any patent vessels which might be used for AV graft.
Unfortunately, ultrasound revealed no patent vessels.
There was ?new left facial droop so Head CT was performed and this was negative for actue bleed/cva.
Repeat labs showed persistent acidosis with Ph 7.11 and worsening renal failure.
