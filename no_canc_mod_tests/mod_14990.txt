Echocardiogram on [**11-6**], showed vigorous left ventricular function, positive pericardial effusion, with tamponade physiology.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories at [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital on [**11-7**] (on the day of admission) revealed his white blood cell count was 21.8, his hematocrit was 25.9, and his platelets were 689.
Chemistries revealed his sodium was 134, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 72, creatinine was 12.3, and his blood glucose was 209.
His INR was 3.3.
The patient had an INR of 4.4 on [**11-6**]; thus, his Coumadin was held.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed his temperature was 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 93, his respiratory rate was 24, his blood pressure was 121/43, and his oxygen saturation was 92% on 6 liters nasal cannula.
Pulmonary examination revealed the patient had coarse [**Month (only) 1440**] sounds throughout with decreased bilateral [**Month (only) 1440**] sounds at the bases.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had left thoracostomy tube placed, #28 French tube, to 27 cm, and 200 cc of fluid were initially drawn; 1800 with positional changes.
A chest x-ray showed proper placement of left chest tube.
Cardiology was called on the day of admission for assessment of questionable tamponade physiology, and global left ventricular function was found to be normal without wall motion abnormalities.
The patient had difficult windows; however, the study demonstrated small-to-moderate anterior and apical adhesions without right atrial collapse or right ventricular diastolic collapse.
Lopressor was increased on hospital day five, postoperative day 25, and the chest tube was removed.
On the day of discharge, the patient had an INR of 2 and was discharged without event.
On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a white blood cell count of 11.4, hematocrit was 30.4, and his platelets were 504.
Coagulations revealed prothrombin time was 17.3, partial thromboplastin time was 28.9, and his INR was 2.
Chemistries revealed sodium was 131, potassium was 5.3, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was 46, creatinine was 1.4.
The patient's calcium was 7.6, magnesium was 2.2, and phosphate was 3.1.
