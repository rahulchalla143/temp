Blood Culture x 2 [**2-22**]: No growth .
Urine Culture [**2-22**]: MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH FECAL CONTAMINATION.
CXR [**2137-2-21**]: FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a right-sided internal jugular venous catheter.
A single-lead left-sided pacemaker is unchanged.Within the lungs, no focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.
Abdominal U/S [**2137-2-22**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old man with h/o dyslipidemia, hypertension, CKD, COPD, afib, bladder ca s/po cystectomy/prostectomy with urostomy, parathyroid resection, and lung nodule resection who presented to OSH with a one day of weakness transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of sepsis from suspected urinary source.
His fevers, leukocytosis (34K->7K), lactatemia, and other evidence of end organ ischemia resolved and he no longer required IV fluids to maintain his pressures.
All in-house culture data was negative or c/w contamination, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] blood cultures were also negative (no urine cultures there).
# CAD/Troponin Leak: Has known h/o CAD s/p stenting to the LAD and LCx in [**2126**].
Was noted at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to have a tropinin of 0.21 and at [**Hospital1 18**] was 0.15 with normal MB index, remaining stable on trend.
EKG was w/o acute ischemic changes and pt was asymptomatic.
He received 5 mg of vitamin K to help correct his INR of 12.7.
# Thrombocytopenia: In setting of elevated INR, concern for DIC- fibrinogen and FDP were sent and negative.
We defer further evaluation of this issue to the outpatient setting.
#INR: This patient will need very tight monitoring of his INR given his fairly large swings even on low doses.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of sepsis from a urinary tract infection.
The following changes have been made to your medications: -START Ceftriaxone 1gram IV once daily for 4 more days (last day [**3-3**]) -START Valtrex 1gram by mouth once daily for 1 more day (last day [**2-28**]) -START Ipratropium/Albuterol MDI [**1-7**] inhalations four times a day as needed for shortness of breath/wheezes -START Saline nasal spray as needed -START Senna 1 tab by mouth twice daily as needed for constipation -DECREASE Coumadin (warfarin) to 1mg by mouth every other day (START taking it [**2-28**]) -Continue taking your other home medications as directed -Please have your INR checked on Friday [**3-1**] .
