HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was transported from the Operating Room to the Intensive Care Unit with a labile blood pressure on low dose inotropic support with an intra-aortic balloon pump, Levophed and requiring large amounts of volume resuscitation.
The Vascular Surgical Team continued to follow the patient and felt that the patient's variable pedal pulse examination was due to the bilateral femoral artery cannulation and his lower extremities were not significantly ischemic.
The patient developed atrial fibrillation and was given boluses of amiodarone and electrolytes were corrected.
The patient's pedal pulses were improved with the removal of the arterial sheaths.
By chest x-ray the patient was with increasing pulmonary edema with diffuse patchy infiltrates.
It was recommended that the patient undergo a videoscopic swallowing evaluation which subsequently showed that the patient had functional oropharyngeal swallowing ability for pureed foods and nectar thick liquids.
The patient was pan-cultured and subsequent sputum cultures showed that he was growing Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus for which he was placed on Vancomycin.
As the patient's white blood cell count on postoperative day number 12 had risen to 21,000, the patient was started on Vancomycin and white blood cell count subsequently dropped to 12,000.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Temperature maximum 98.1 F.; pulse 75 and in sinus rhythm; blood pressure 133/68; respiratory rate 17; room air oxygen saturation 92 to 96%.
White blood cell count is 12.2, hematocrit 30.7, platelet count 410.
Potassium 3.5, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0.
