Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination reveals patient was tender to light palpation in the epigastric region.

Pneumoperitoneum was consistent with peritoneal dialysis.
Abdominal computerized tomography scan showed free fluid in the abdomen and no retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Peritonitis - The patient was treated with intraperitoneal Vancomycin and initially gentamicin.
The patient's ascitic fluid grew out pansensitive enterococcus.
Pancreatitis - The patient's amylase and lipase were significantly elevated on admission.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was contact[**Name (NI) **] over the course of the hospitalization and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was not deemed indicated secondary to normal liver enzymes and normal total bilirubin.
On [**12-16**], the patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed a 1.2 cm common bile duct, however, no stones were visualized at that time.
On [**1-4**], in response to increased abdominal pain and increasing pancreatic enzymes, the patient had another right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed a hepatic common bile duct measuring 8 mm in diameter.
On [**2178-12-23**], in response to increased abdominal pain and increase in Dilaudid requirement, the patient had right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed a common bile duct of 6.5 mm with no stones visualized.
On [**1-4**], the patient had abdominal computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis which showed moderate fracturing of the tail of the pancreas with no discrete abscess or fluid collection.
The patient's Dilantin level on admission was very low raising the concern that the patient was not compliant with her medications.
Shortly after transfer to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit the patient was weaned off pressors and blood pressure was subsequently stable.
The very next day the patient was doing well with stable blood pressure and stable respiratory status.
Free Dilantin level showed that to be too high.
