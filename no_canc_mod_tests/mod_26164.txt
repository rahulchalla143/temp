At OSH, his vitals were T 102.4, HR 90, RR 24, BP 99/59, O2 sat 92% RA.
EKG showed AF but no ischemic changes.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn and found to peak at 4.26 with CK 345 (downtrending to 3.12 and 288 at time of transfer).
His BNP was 46.
Also notable was a bandemia to 17% on a WBC of 3.9.
A blood culture showed GPCs in [**12-30**] blood cultures with speciation still pending at time of transfer.
TTE was done that showed EF 20%, down from >55% two years ago.

MICROBIOLOGY: BLOOD CULTURES:  negative x3 URINE CULTURE:  negative .. STUDIES: .
EKG:  Atrial fibrillation with HR 130s.
.. 2D- ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2164-8-29**]):  PER OUTSIDE HOSPITAL RECORD LV dilitation with diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with EF 20%, biatrial enlargement, mild to moderate MR. .. TRANS-THORACIC ECHO ([**2164-8-31**]): The atria are moderately dilated.
Precise LV systolic function quantification is difficult because of tachycardia.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-8-11**], tachycardia and mild LV dysfunction are new.
There was no significant family history of premature CAD and no Q-waves on EKG to indicate a prior myocardial infarction.
On admission his troponin-T peaked at  0.28 and CPK peaked at 243.
We checked a lipid panel, which returned normal, and opted not to begin statin therapy.
He was discharged on his outpatient cardiovascular regimen, which included a BB, ACEI, ASA, Lasix, and spironolactone.
# PUMP:  Per OSH records, recent EF was 20%, down from >55% two years ago.
Iron studies were checked to r/o hemochromatosis and TSH came back normal to r/u hypo or hyperthyroidism; EKG, as above, did not show any pathologic q-waves or ST-deviations and thus was not suggestive of active or past coronary artery disease.
Our repeat TTE showed an LVEF of 50-55% with only mild progression, if any, of LV dysfunction.
Upon admission to the CCU, we tried to slow his rate with 5 mg pushes of IV metoprolol.
However, after 20 mg of Lopressor his rate came down to the 110s, but he remained in atrial fibrillation.
# HTN:  At admission he was hypotensive with SBP in the 90-100s.
After cardioversion, as his blood pressure tolerated, we added back his outpatient antihypertensives.
His initial CXR showed possible pneumonia and labs showed 17% bands on normal white count.
[**12-30**] blood cultures grew out GPC, speciation not yet known at time of transfer.
CXR, blood and urine cultures all returned negative.
