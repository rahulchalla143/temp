[**12-29**] CT Head: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
There is apparent widening of the mediastinal contour, which is secondary to vascular structures and fat based on prior CT from [**2159-12-12**].
In addition, three displaced femoral neck fracture appears unchanged though is incompletely evaluated on this femur study and is limited by osteopenia and body habitus.
Possible etiology included lines, urine, wounds, pneumonia, etc.
Blood cultures from an outside facility grew enterobacter and klebsiella.
Urine culture here at [**Hospital1 18**] grew klebsiella and pseudomonas.
A TEE was negative for vegetations.
Subsequent blood cultures were all negative, and repeat urine cultures were also negative.
The patient had a CT abdomen on a recent previous admission that showed no evidence of such a fistula, so repeat imaging was not done.
Goal INR is [**2-22**].
INR should be checked after discharge and coumadin dose adjusted as needed.
BP should be checked after discharge and BB restarted as needed.
