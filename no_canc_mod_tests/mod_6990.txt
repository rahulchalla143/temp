Ms [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 28792**] had elevated blood pressures (140-160/80-94) as well as a headache while in triage.
Preeclampsia labs were normal, with the exception of the elevated creatinine (4.3), which was consistent with her baseline.
Although her blood pressures were elevated and there was a concern for preeclampsia, it was a difficult diagnosis to make since she was anuric.
The goal for her blood pressure was to keep systolic between 140-160 and diastolic between 90-100.
ATU testing on the day of admission was reassuring with BPP [**7-24**], AFI 17.8, vertex, tracing was appropriate for gestational age.
Her most recent growth scan was on [**11-19**], EFW 1216g (55%).
HD#2 The morning of hospital day #2, her blood pressure was 148/86 and she was asymptomatic.
Hemodialysis was started and her blood pressure was elevated to 170-180/100.
After discussions with the renal team and anesthesia, the decision was made to proceed with delivery for severe preeclampsia, based on blood pressures.
Baby boy was delivered from vertex, weight 1325g, apgars 7,8.
Her blood pressures improved to 130-150/70-90.
HD#3/POD#1 Blood pressures 120-156/90's on Lopressor.
Pt complained of shortness of breath, lungs had crackles had the bases, and her oxygen saturation was 92% on 4 liters of oxygen.
Her blood pressures remained elevated during hemodialysis, 160-170/90-111.
Her oxygen saturation was 92-94% on 5 liters of oxygen, and she had decreased lung sounds at the bases.
CXR findings were consistent with pulmonary edema.
Blood pressures still elevated and oxygen saturation 93% on 5 liters of oxygen.
Preeclampsia labs were stable with the exception of a slight drop in platelets to 126.
A bedside echo revealed no significant change from a prior study and her EKG was unchanged as well, normal sinus rhythm.
Repeat CXR showed severe pulmonary edema.
Blood pressures 130-160/80's.
Labs stable, creatinine 5.3. .
Blood pressures 140-160/70-102.
HD#7/POD#5 Blood pressures still elevated, but stable.
Hemodialysis removed 2 liters of fluid.
