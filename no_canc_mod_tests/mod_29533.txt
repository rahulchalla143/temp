She was weaned off levophed overnight, with stable HR and SBP 90s-100s on maintenance IVF at 100/hr.
Urosepsis was most likely, as patient had a UA in the ED with WBCs, leukesterase positive and with many bacteria.
The first culture grew three equal colonies of GNR suspected to be fecal contamination, but notably this culture was drawn from her foley.
Subsequent urine cultures (after starting antibiotics) were negative to date.
When INR dropped to 2.1, her coumadin was restarted.
When it dropped below 2, a heparin gtt was started to bridge until INR is [**3-5**].
On day of discharge, her INR was 1.8.
Will have biweekly INR checks at [**Hospital1 1501**]  #Flash pulmonary edema: Pt developed transient respiratory distress twice in the ICU, in the context of holding home lasix and bolusing IV fluids to treat early sepsis.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation without ST or T changes.
CXR without acute process, stable/improved pulmonary edema.
