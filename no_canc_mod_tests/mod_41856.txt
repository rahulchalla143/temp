Sulcal and ventricular prominence may represent global atrophy, though given the prominence of the temporal horns, NPH should be considered in the proper clinical setting.
This can be further assessed with MRI or multiphase CT.    Brief Hospital Course: A 68 yo gentleman with progressive decline transferred from [**Location (un) 95454**] after PNA/AMS with an acute change in mental status during/after [**Location (un) **].
His acute decline during [**Location (un) **] appears to correspond roughly to a rapid ventricular rate and lidocaine administration.
EEG was negative for seizure activity, but seizure was thought to be most likely cause given improvement over a day and seizure-lowering properties of lidocaine and alkalosis.
Head CT showed nothing concerning for an acute intracranial process.
Continuous EEG monitorring revealed no epileptiform activity.
