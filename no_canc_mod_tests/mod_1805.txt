IMAGING: [**2122-5-25**] CARDIAC CATH: 1) Selective angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated significant three-vessel coronary artery disease.
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial normotension, with a central aortic pressure of 132/67 mmHg.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls.
Post-cath her EKG showed resolution of her ST changes and her CKMB peaked at 153.
Her echo showed new EF 35% with inferior hypokinesis.
Should have another echo checked at follow-up and if remains in low EF then consider for ICD placement.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Should have another echo checked at follow-up and if remains in low EF then consider for ICD placement and also spironolactone.
