Her supratherapeutic INR of 4.2 was reversed with FFP and she was given 6 units of pRBCs total during this hospitalization.
No source of bleeding was found but patient's HCT was stabilized so her coumadin was restarted.
Reported dark guaiac positive stool, and had an 11 pt HCT drop over past month.
Also given high INR and reported recent falls at home, an RP bleed was considered, but CT abdomen was negative.
Ended up with total transfusion of 6 units PRBCs and 2 units FFP, with INR afterwards down to 2.2.
Her GI bleed was thought to be due to supratherapeutic INR in setting of multiple other anticoagulations.
She will need a close follow up for her HCT and INR.
# S/P MECHANICAL AVR: on Warfarin at home, INR 4.6 on admission.
She was started on heparin gtt bridge when patient stabilized and restarted on coumadin after EGD/colonoscopy/video capsule study did not reveal a source of active bleed.

You had chest pain when you first came in, but your blood tests were negative for cardiac enzyme (marker of damage to your heart).
You had colonoscopy, upper endoscopy and capsule endoscopy done which did not show the source of bleeding.
However, your bleeding stopped and your red blood cell count remained stable.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
These CHANGES were made to your medications: - STOP imdur (isosorbide mononitrate) and olmesartan for now as your blood pressure were ok.
- STOP potassium - STOP zantac (ranitidine) - HOLD coumadin for [**2208-5-13**], then you can follow instructions from [**Company 191**] anticoagulation (coumadin) clinic.
