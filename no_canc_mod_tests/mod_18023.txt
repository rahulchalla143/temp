CT head: chronic small vessel infarcts, no acute process .
It would be useful to obtain a chest radiograph today to correlate with the CT findings In order to determine the rate of change of the multifocal pulmonary abnormality seen.

CT c spine negative; MRI negative but did show edema of cervical vertebrae.
This is a sudden drop in blood pressure that can be caused by many triggers, but urination is one of them and your episode occured after you had used the bathroom.
