CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2180-5-1**] 1:04 PM Unchanged appearance of right basal ganglia hemorrhage  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ICU for managment of her intracranial hemorrhage.
A follow up CT on [**2180-5-1**] revealed minimal change from her initial imaging.
The patient's exam stablized and she was more easily arrousable on the second day of her admission ([**2180-4-30**]).
Her blood pressure was kept at a MAP <130mmHg and a systolic <160mmHg.
Uranalysis revealed 5-10WBC and a few bacteria, LE and Nitrites were negative.
A decision was made not to treat this result and to repeat the urinalysis and await cultures from the initial urine sample.
Upon arrival to the floors, a repeat UA was obtained and suggestive of a urinary tract infection.
She had an NGTube in place, and this was not a permanent solution to the problem, so consent was obtained from the family and a PEG was placed on [**5-5**]/8, no complications.
