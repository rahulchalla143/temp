The cause of her ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest is uncertain.
She possibly had an alcoholic cardiomyopathy that caused the arrhythmia although that was not noted on the Echo that was performed while she was on pressors.
Her potassium was elevated at the OSH and may have precipitated her arrhythmia after several days of feeling ill.  She may have had an ingestion which led to electrolyte abdnormalites and the acidosis.
Her hematocrit dropped to 20 despite 5 units of PRBCs.
An echocardiogram excluded a pericardial effusion.
Her peak plateau pressures were very high.
Her LFTS drastically increased from the OSH to levels seen at [**Hospital1 18**] most likely secondary to shock liver.
She did not appear to be # Altered mental status - Patient's neurologic exam is concerning for anoxic brain injury.
Her neurological exam was concerning for severe hypoxic brain injury.
