Chest x-ray showed lung expansion but some persistent hydrothorax, so a second chest tube was placed secondary to concern of an abdominal wound given the level of the stab wounds.
A DPL was performed which was grossly negative, and fluid was sent for studies.
Initial FAST ultrasound times two was negative for pericardial tamponade.
The initial hematocrit was 41, but he had decreased systolic blood pressure at less than 100 after 2 L of lactated Ringer's and blood transfusion.
Repeated FAST bedside ultrasound revealed pericardial fluid, and the patient was noted to be desaturating into the 80s, and he was then taken to the operating room for subxiphoid pericardial window, which was negative.
This was controlled with a wedge resection, and the left chest was explored.
Exploratory laparotomy was then performed when the ................. returned as positive with greater than 3000 red blood cells.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Initial exam revealed a temperature of 93.1?????
?, heart rate 100, blood pressure 130/palp, oxygen saturation 94%.
Pulmonary:  Coarse bilateral breath sounds, decreased on the left with knife stab wounds located in the center of the sternum, inferior to the nipple, with active oozing.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 17.4, hematocrit 40.5, platelet count 294, repeat hematocrit was 25.5, with intraoperative hematocrit of 30.2; [**Known firstname **] 14.4, PTT 52.3, INR 1.4; fibrinogen was 124; urinalysis showed [**2-6**] red blood cells, [**5-14**] white blood cells, occasional bacteria; DPL showed 10 white cells, 3875 red cells; chemistries with a sodium of 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 102, bicarb 19, BUN 9, creatinine 1.3; amylase 69; on presentation, lactate was 17.6; ABG was 7.41, 36, 307, 24, 0.
Total fluids in the OR were 7 U packed red blood cells, 8 U fresh frozen plasma, 1 six-pack of platelets, 7 L Crystalloid, and the urine output was 1200 cc, and estimated blood loss was 1500 cc.
Chest tubes were in place as previously mentioned.
The patient was subsequently taken to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring postoperatively.
Chest tubes remained in place and continued to drain substantial amounts of fluid.
A head CT was obtained because of change in mental status, and this was negative for acute hemorrhage.
A Page 1 was prepared and sent with the patient regarding follow-up care, including discharge of the staples on postoperative day #14, and information regarding follow-up was also forwarded with the patient.
