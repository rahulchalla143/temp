In the ED, vitals initially T 99.4, HR 80, BP 119/58, RR 16, oxygen saturation 95% on 3L, 88% on room air.
A CXR revealed a RLL infiltrate.
Known multiple RBC allo-antibodies and difficult cross-match  Social History: She lives with her 2 children aged 4 and 2 years-old.
Physical Exam: Physical examination on admission: VITALS: T 99.4, HR 100, BP 110/55, RR 20, Sat 99% on 3 liters via NC.
RESP: Dullness to percussion at right base.
Pertinent Results: Relevant laboratory data on admission: CBC: WBC 11.1, Hb 6.9, Hct 19.9, Platelet 552 NEUTS-54 BANDS-1 LYMPHS-35 MONOS-7 EOS-2 BASOS-1 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0 NUC RBCS-1 HYPOCHROM-2+ ANISOCYT-3+ POIKILOCY-3+ MACROCYT-2+ MICROCYT-1+ POLYCHROM-NORMAL SPHEROCYT-1+ OVALOCYT-1+ TARGET-2+ [**Name2 (NI) **]-2+  Chemistry: Na 138, K 4.7, Cl 106, HCO3 24, BUN 8, Creat 0.7, Glucose 0.7  Relevant imagind studies:  [**2103-5-19**] CXR: Stable cardiac contours.
[**2103-5-20**] CXR: Heart size is within normal limits and there is no evidence for CHF.
1) Pneumonia +/- acute chest syndrome: CXR on admission revealed a RLL infiltrate suspicious for pneumonia, although acute chest syndrome can not be ruled out.
Examination was also remarkable for hypoxemia, with saturation in the low 80s.
She was afebrile on admission, but subsequently developed a fever in hospital with rising WBC up to 34.6 on [**5-21**].
She also developed worsening hypoxemia on [**5-21**] with increasing SOB in the setting of decreasing hematocrit to 15.5, then 14.3.
An ABG revealed pH 7.41/38/70.
A repeat CXR was performed and remarkable for worsening RML/RLL pneumonia.
Sputum cultures returned as OP flora, without predominance of organisms (can not rule out Chlamydia or Mycoplasma).
Blood and urine cultures all returned negative.
Serial CXRs initially revealed worsening picture, with interval development of a LLL infiltrate consistent with multilobar process, and bilateral pleural effusions.
An echo was performed that showed normal EF>60%.
She also has persistent leukocytosis with WBC 16.2 at discharge.
She will need follow-up imaging after completion of her antibiotic course to document complete resolution of infiltrate/effusion, as well as repeat WBC.
2) [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cell disease: Hematocrit on admission was 19.9 (around baseline), down to 15.3 on [**5-20**] with 2+ [**Month/Year (2) 14165**] cells on peripheral smear, then a nadir of 14.3 on [**5-21**].
Ms. [**Known lastname 14164**] has multiple allo-antibodies and HRB absent which is rare except in some African-Americans.
The blood bank was unable to provide matched blood.
Further transfusion was therefore held.
Her hematocrit slowly trended up to 22 at discharge.
She will complete her course as an out-patient (last doses on [**2103-5-28**]).
Saturation 94-96% on room air.
Hematocrit 22.5.
You will need a repeat CXR in the next 2 weeks.
