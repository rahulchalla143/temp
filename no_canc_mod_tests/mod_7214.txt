Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-4-30**], the mitral valve has been repaired (ring annuloplasty); however, there is now systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet with mild left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
He was transferred to the CVICU intubated on propofol and Neo to optimize his blood pressure and cardiac output.
EKG changes postop were evident with ST elevations and a intermittent LBBB.
POD #2 he was doing well and transferred to the floor.
Further tele monitoring revealed LBBB resolved.
