IMAGING: [**2101-4-18**] ECHO Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional and mild global hypokinesis.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2096-12-13**], the severity of aortic regurgitation has increased.
[**2101-4-18**] CT NECK W/CONTRAST : 1.
[**2101-4-18**] CT CHEST ABD & PELVIS WITH CO:1.
In absence of prior exams confirming stability follow up chest CT in 6 months recommended.
[**2101-4-15**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): 1.
EGD [**4-11**]: Mucous in the esophagus [**Last Name (un) 23424**] esophagus Small non-bleeding pre-pyloric gastric ulcer Small non-bleeding stomach body ulcer (distal lesser curvature) Small stomach body ulcer with stigmata of recent bleeding (endoclip) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
EGD [**4-13**]: Coffee ground heme in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, without active bleeding or source of bleeding Diverticulum in the esophagus at 20cm from the incisors Previously-placed endoclip in good position without bleeding from underlying gastric body ulcer Gastritis, duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
EGD [**4-15**]: Thick mucous in the esophagus [**Last Name (un) 23424**] esophagus Non-bleeding distal esophagitis Non-bleeding gastritis Small non-bleeding pre-pyloric ulcer Small previously-clipped gastric body ulcer, with endoclip in good position and no bleeding Few small non-bleeding angioectasias in the jejunum Non-bleeding duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to mid-jejunum .
The patient had multiple acute HCT drops to low 20s and required pRBC transfusion x9 (2 at outside hospital, 7 at [**Hospital1 18**]) with stable HCT since [**4-14**].
H. pylori evaluation was negative.
Coagulation and platelet counts were consistently within normal limits since [**4-15**].
Stool guaiac is expected to be positive for weeks given recent bleed.
He should follow up with GI to have repeat EGD to evaluate gastric ulcer and consider capsule endoscopy to further evaluate a small bowel source.
However, a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis found no evidence of overt malignancy.
Cause of new-onset A fib is most likely from physical stress of recent bleeding events, but alternatively may be from cardiac irritation due to thromboembolism or pneumonia; alternatively worsening CHF, CAD, hyperthyroidism (TSH wnl [**2101-4-13**]), or hypertension (pt currently normotensive on floor).
TTE [**4-18**] showed no intramural thrombosis.
# Leukocytosis: Patient had an elevated white count 13-21k with neutrophilia this admission, which trended down over time, and has been afebrile on the floor.
An underlying hematologic malignancy could explain leukocytosis, but DIFF shows no atypicals.
Urine culture was negative at admission, and current antibiotics cover many uropathogens.
No clinical evidence of cellulitis or foot ulcer infection at time of discharge, white count normalized to 9.2. .
Wound culture grew corynebacterium, which is a likely skin contaminant.
Podiatry's evaluation is that the ulcer probes deep to bone without signs of infection, they recommend disposition on PO antibiotics, weight bear on right heel with surgical shoe, and that further surgical debridement planned as outpatient.
He will need to be monitored for signs of GI bleeding, including melena and bright red blood per rectum.
He will be following up as an outpatient with GI at the [**Hospital1 18**] for repeat EGD to evaluate gastric ulcers.
The patient will require follow up as an outpatient with podiatry for debridement and evaluation of his right foot ulcers for contact casting, follows with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and appt scheduled.
You required blood transfusions and two ICU stays for your bleeding to stabilize and at the time of discharge your blood counts were stable.
You will follow up with our GI doctors at the date/time below to repeat an endoscopy and evaluate your stomach ulcers.
They may also consider to do further studies of your small bowel at that time.
In people with these conditions we often start blood thinners, but after several discussions with you and your family we decided the risk of re-bleeding from your GI tract was too high.
We have made the following changes to your medications: -STOP taking hydralazine, Imdur and valsartan for your blood pressure, you can restart this 1 week after your discharge or sooner if your pressure is running over 140 -START taking aspirin 81mg daily -CONTINUE augment, an antibiotic started in the hospital for your skin infection, last day will be [**2101-4-23**] -CONTINUE lasix 40mg daily -INCREASE metoprolol to 25mg twice a day -INCREASE ropinirole to 1.5mg at nighttime -START pantoprazole 40mg twice daily   Completed by:[**2101-4-20**
