Cultures from the wound at the time of this procedure grew MRSA, so the patient was restarted on IV vancomycin.
(had been d/c'd on [**9-14**] after long course of tx) At that time, ID was consulted and recommended that wound cultures be repeated during the next procedure, and if negative, antibiotics could be stopped after a 2-week course.
Wound cultures were not repeated, but from the time of her first surgery through her discharge, the patient did not have an elevated white count, never spiked a fever, and never clinically seemed infected, so on re-consultation, ID felt that antibiotics could be stopped at the time of discharge, so vanco was d/c'd on [**2196-11-8**]   Discharge Medications: 1.
Please call the [**Hospital 5498**] clinic @ ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5238**] and schedule an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7376**] in 4 weeks upon hospital discharge.
