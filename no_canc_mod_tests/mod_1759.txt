His exam was basically reflecting a normal mental status and no focal deficits.
Neurocysticercosis: *Diagnosed in [**2115**] with cyst in 4th ventricle, resected at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital (path confirmed dx), reportedly received anti-parasite treatment *[**12-8**] at [**Hospital 1263**]  Hospital reportedly treated again (albendazole/prednisone); worsened dizziness at this time *[**2124**] multiple admits for severe HA: persistent lymphocytic pleocytosis and actually treated empirically for TB meningitis; ventriculitis vs trapped 4th ventricle on MRI *[**5-9**] VP shunt placed *[**8-9**] VP shunt revised 2.

Please also correlate with the report of CT brain done today.
Head CT [**3-18**]: HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: As in the prior study, a right frontal approach ventriculoperitoneal shunt is in place, with non-communicating hydrocephalus suggestive of shunt failure.
EEG [**3-19**]: negative for any abnormal signal.
Head CT [**3-22**]: VP shunt is unchanged.
Minimal blood products were present previously and likely unrelated to tube removal.
Close interval followup with repeat imaging is recommended as clinically indicated.
Upon admission, an external ventricular drain was placed to alleviate the elevated pressure in his head.
His examination revealed soft compartments.
Post-procedure head CT was also done, and without acute consequence from drain removal.
An urgent CT scan w/o contrast evidenced increased hydrocephalus and severe dilatation of his 3rd ventricle.
Blood cultures were negative till date [**3-28**].
MECLIZINE - 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] 5.
You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
