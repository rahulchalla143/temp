CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2186-11-8**] 10:09 PM IMPRESSION:  1.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2186-11-9**] 8:08 AM Stable- No changes  PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2186-11-10**] 10:29 AM IMPRESSION: Dobbhoff tube is seen with its tip in the body of the stomach and last side port about 4cm from GE junction.
EEG Study Date of [**2186-11-11**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of severe focal slowing, attenuation of faster frequencies, and absent alpha rhythm over the left hemisphere.
In addition, moderate diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is etiologically non-specific.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2186-11-11**] 10:40 AM Feeding tube ends in the stomach.
EEG Study Date of [**2186-11-12**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of severe focal slowing, attenuation of faster frequencies, and absent alpha rhythm over the left hemisphere.
In addition, moderate diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is etiologically non-specific.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2186-11-13**] 10:24 AM PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A Dobbhoff feeding tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the stomach.
Lung volumes remain low.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2186-11-16**] 1:24 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-13**], the Dobbhoff tube has been pulled back slightly so that there is now only minimal upward curve of the distal tip.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2186-11-16**] 8:53 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2186-11-16**] 2:40 PM FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position.
Chest findings on this portable examination remain unchanged and stable.

She underwent an angiogram post op which revealed a complete clipping.
A Head CT was performed revealing linear hyperdenisty at the left frontal gyri as well as a developing hypodenisty in the L frontal lobe which could be edema vs ischemia.
Overnight, The patient spiked a temperature of 101.4 and cultures were sent.
The Blood and Urine cultures from [**11-9**] were negative.
The serum Dilantin level was 9 and a 500mg bolus of Diolantin was given.
A CT of the head revealed a small caudate stroke on the left.
On [**11-11**], The patient was again febrils and blood and urine cultures were sent which were negative.
The EEG was consistent with severe focal dysfunction in the left hemisphere without seizures.
A Urine culture was sent which was negative.
A blood culture was sent which was *****  Under continuous EEG monitoring, the study showed no evidence of seizures.
CXR on [**11-13**] revealed stable retrocardiac opacity that was thought to be atelectasis.
On [**11-14**], patient's exam was stable, EO to noxious stimuli, MAE L>R, but was febrile to 102.4 overnight.
Dilaudid 0.5mg was given for pain control and the patient's systolic blood pressure was hypotensive to 70s.
A urine culture was sent which was Negative.
A blood cx was sent which was ************.
A chest x ray was performed which was consistent with good placement.
The patient's serum BUN was elevated at 29 (basleine 16-19)and the patient was given a NS bolus of 250cc.
Ophthalmology was consulted for evaluation of L eye edema.
