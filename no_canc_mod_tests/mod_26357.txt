The axial source images suggest an intimal flap raising the possibility of underlying spontaneous dissection.
Calcifications of the cavernous segments of the internal carotid arteries, right greater than left are mild.
The largest included lymph node, in the precarinal station, measures 2.3 cm x 1.3 cm.
CT perfusion images could not be processed due to patient motion.
Occlusion of the left ECA from approximately 3.5cm from the common carotid bifurcation, which may relate to underlying dissection.
Perfusion of left MCA and ACA via cross-filling from a patent circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
CT [**2193-5-15**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarction.
IMPRESSION: No new acute changes in comparison to the prior CT examination from earlier today.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
MRI [**2193-5-15**] 9:00pm: FINDINGS: There is decreased diffusion throughout virtually the entire left middle cerebral artery distribution with minimal corresponding FLAIR signal abnormality.
CT [**2193-5-16**]: There has been interval evolution of the large left MCA territory infarct visualized on MRI.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
His exam was first only  remarkable for encephalopathy with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was found to have a left ICA and a left ECA occlusion.
Another possibility is that the left ICA and ECA occlusion was due to cardiac embolism.
The patient was noted to have a sub therapeutic INR and he was initially started on a heparin drip.
A head CT that was obtained at the time did not show any significant change.
The patient was admitted to the Neuro-ICU for further monitoring and imaging.
A follow up CT confirmed the finding and showed a hyperdense MCA on the left.
Neuro - the patient had a large, nearly complete left MCA infarct - his BP was allowed to auto regulate and he was kept on frequent neuro checks out of concern for edema - he had a follow up CT on [**2193-4-17**] which showed some edema at this site of the stroke but no significant shift - the patient became more awake and alert, although would not follow commands  CV - the patient was allowed to auto regulate, he was placed back on his home dose of metoprolol for rate control.
- his home doses of Lasix was restarted at 1/2 dose to avoid a decrease in blood pressure - he was eventually restarted on a heparin gtt for his afib  Pulm - the patient's family made the patient DNR/DNI - he was noted to have ecoli and s.pneumo in the lungs, and was started on cefipime  The family decided not to pursue trachestomy and PEG tube.
