He was seen by the neurology ED resident after he had been medicated and there was no apparent seizure activity (though exam limited due to medication administration).
Pertinent Results: [**2146-3-23**] wbc=10.6 hct=45.3 plt=510 [**2146-3-22**] pt=15.2 inr=1.5  ptt=29.7  SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE ABDOMEN [**2146-3-22**]: There is interval placement of an NG tube with its tip terminating in the distal stomach.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST [**2146-3-15**]: There is bibasilar atelectasis with tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
An ultrasound could be helpful for further characterization if clinically indicated.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder is unremarkable.
CT REFORMATS: The sagittal and coronal reconstructions are helpful in evaluating the anatomy of the bowel.
EEG [**2146-3-9**]: FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of focal mixed frequency theta and delta slowing in the left temporal region with extension to left frontal areas.
The background rhythms did not change significantly over the course of the recording.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with occasional PVCs.
CT head [**2146-3-9**]: Comparison is made to a prior CT from [**2145-3-18**].
The supratentorial ventricular system appears to have decreased in size when compared to the prior examination with ex-vacuo dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.
There is no CT evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
CT head +/- contrast: Comparison is made to [**2146-3-9**].
TECHNIQUE: 8-MDCT axial images of the head were obtained without and with IV contrast.
IMPRESSION: 1) No CT evidence of abscess.
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT scan followed by CT angiography.
FINDINGS: The noncontrast study reveals a large left temporal/parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage with mild mass effect, likely dampened by the adjacent large area of porencephaly resulting from prior infarction, noted on the previous examination of [**2146-3-10**].
CT ANGIOGRAPHY FINDINGS: The area of the previous clipping of the left middle cerebral artery trifurcation aneurysm is essentially uninterpretable due to extensive streak artifacts arising from the surgical clip.
ADDENDUM: There may be a very small right parietal chronic subdural fluid collection that, interestingly, was difficult to appreciate on the prior head CT scan.
CXR [**2146-3-23**]: Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged compared to the prior study.

Seizurs on admission liekly [**12-22**] chronic infarct; infectious etiology ruled out with CSF studies (including HSV PCR), no SAH on initial CT therefore unlikely recurrence or development of new aneurysm.
SDH incidentally found on [**3-14**] CT head and likely [**12-22**] to either LP versus hitting head on bed railing on [**2146-3-11**].
SDH stable on serial CT head.
Infiltrate noted on CXR [**2146-3-16**], perhaps [**12-22**] multiple unsuccessful attmepts at NGT placement.
-aggressive monitoring of electrolytes given hx of arrhythmia with goal K>4.0 and MG>2.0 throuhgout hospitalization.

ID- initial CXR without evidence of PNA but during last week of hospitalization and in setting of severly distended bowel, Pt developed fever with no source on blood cx or urine cx; empirically started on Levoflox and flagyl; C diff negative x3; repeat CXR showed new infiltrate and Pt cont to be febrile therefore Pt started on Zosyn for broader coverage and defevesced for 3d prior to discharge.
