EKG demonstrated NSR with q waves in III and AVF, TWI in II, III, AVF, 1 mm STE in V1, STD in V3, V4.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
EF 45%.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2193-7-23**] demonstrated: The LMCA, LAD, LCX showed no obstructive coronary artery disease.
CXR [**2193-7-23**] AP single view of the chest is obtained with patient in supine position.
Echo [**9-19**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Transmitral Doppler imaging is consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-9-4**], the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased.
Echo [**9-21**]: The left and right atrium are markedly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-9-19**], the findings are similar.
[**9-18**] Renal Ultrasound: FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.9 cm, and the left kidney measures 10.2 cm.
CD138 highlights plasma cells in interstitial and perivascular distribution, which by Kappa/Lambda light chain immunostaining appear polytypic.
Erythrocytes show significant anisopoikilocytosis with polychromatophils, macrocytes, target cells, echinocytes, dacrocytes, microcytes, ovalocytes and basophilic stippling.
A peripheral blood smear was not submitted.
The white blood cell count appears normal.
Differential count shows 91% neutrophils, 3% monocytes,  8% lymphocytes, 1% other myelocyte.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of two pieces of fragmented core biopsy with partial aspiration artifact measuring 0.6 cm in aggregate.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 62766**] is a 44 year old female admitted initially to an OSH for multifocal pneumonia, found to have an NSTEMI, s/p BMS to RCA on admission.
She had cardiac cath and was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented x2 with BMS.
Her CXR improved, however, she had persistent altered mental status and tachypnea thought be secondary to a central process preventing extubation.
Due to her distorted anatomy secondary to gastric bypass, a PEG was not performed at the same time.
EEG x 2 showed toxic-metabolic patterns.
A renal biopsy could not rule out thrombotic microangiopathy, but was felt to be consistent with ATN.
She had a biopsy of her skin consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy.
Her thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities resolved, however, the patient suffered ischemia of her distal extremities with resulting necrosis.
She had an acitenobacter vent associated pneumonia and completed a course of augmentin.
CK reached levels greater than 10,000.
Her CK trended down to normal levels.
Pain Control: The patient experienced continuous pain from her necrosed and gangrenous feet and fingers.
Her neosinephrine and vasopressin was discontinued and she eventually remaned on levophed for blood pressure support.
Her blood pressure, lactate levels, and central venous O2 saturations improved with initiation of dobutamine.
Her dobutamine was weaned off and she was able to maintain a mean arterial pressure over 60.
The afternoon of [**9-21**] @4pm her routine ABG showed a pH of 6.87, a bicarbonate of 4, and a lactate of 12.9.
These results came as a surprise as an ABG at noon [**9-21**] showed a pH of 7.33, with a bicarbonate of 16, and a lactate of 2.0.
She remained otherwise hemodynamically stable during this period without alterations in her baseline blood pressure or heart rate.
ABGs showed her pH slowly improving to 7.1, with bicarbonate levels improving to 9, however her lactate continued to rise to a peak of 20.9.
Stat cardiac echo did not show cardiac tamponade, or new wall motion abnormalities suggestive of pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction.
Cardiac enzymes were trended and were flat.
Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen.
Liver enzymes showed elevated transaminases consistent with ishemic liver, normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, normal lipase, but an elevated amylase to 853.
CPR was initiated for 90 seconds.
Her blood pressure increased and her pulse returned.
She was given epinephrine, atropine, and sodium bicarbonate and her blood pressure returned.
again, she was told of her grave prognosis, and that her acidosis could not be alleviated.
From the hours of 6am through 8:30am the patient was given epinephrine, atropine, and sodium bicarbonate in order to stabilize her blood pressure.
The patient's hematocrit dring this time decreased from 18.0 to 9.0, possibly from intrabdominal hemorrhage from perforated bowel as a result of bowel ischemia.
