An electrocardiogram was normal.
Troponin were negative.
Hematocrit was 25.
Lentis 12 units and regular insulin sliding scale.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was afebrile; blood pressure was 134/92; heart rate 82; respiratory rate 16; saturating 95% on room air.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Chest: Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
LABORATORY DATA:  Potassium of 3.6; creatinine 3.1, baseline being 2.9 to 3.3.
Albumin was 2.1.
CBC was stable.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 102.
The patient's enzymes were cycled times three and were negative for any ischemic changes.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization during this admission for questionable ischemic cause of her ventricular tachycardia which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease with her proximal right coronary artery diffusely diseased, mid right coronary artery 100% stenosed, proximal left anterior descending 30%, distal circumflex 100%, obtuse marginal one 70%, with an elevated LVEDP of 16.
EP was consulted and they felt that optimally, they would prefer an EP study and possible ventricular tachycardia ablation; however, her present vascular access issues precluded any studies.
Additionally, for cardiac issues, an echocardiogram was performed in the hospital.
Her ejection fraction was greater than 65%.
