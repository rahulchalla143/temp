Chest CT [**2114-7-15**]: 1.
Chest x-ray [**7-15**]:Mild CHF with interstitial edema .
Cardiac Catheterization [**2114-7-16**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Selective limitted coronary angiography revealed native severe thre vessel disease as previously described.
Hemodynamic assessment revealed decreased systemic aortic pressure and tachycardia to the 120s.
Right sided filling pressures and Left ventrucular filling pressures were highly elevated at 25 mm Hg (mean RAp) and 32 mm Hg (PCWP).
There was severe pulmonary hypertension with systolic PAp of 90 mmHg.
Cardiac index was severely depressed at 1.7 L/min/m2.
Left ventriculogram was deferred given renal failure and hemodynamic compromise.
Final angiography demonstrated a 10% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow (See PTCA Comments).
chest x-ray [**2114-7-17**]:No significant changes in the appearance of diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltration.
Chest x-ray [**2114-7-19**]: No evidence for CHF.
He was taken for catheterization for NSTEMI, found to have severe pulmonary hypertension, and an occluded saphenous vein graft to OM2 that was successfully stented with a cypher drug eluding stent.
Cardiac index was severely depressed at 1.7 L/min/m2.
Of note, while in the hospital a transplant work-up was intiated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] because of the need for frequent coronary intervention.
Echo was done on [**2114-7-20**] and showed: The left ventricular cavity was severely dilated and overall left ventricular systolic function was severely depressed.
Heparin and coumadin were started b/c pt was found to have LV hypokinesis and EF 20-30 % by echo and this was worrisome for clot formation.
INR was elevated to 4.6 on [**7-20**] and was reversed with vitamin K.  However, the team did not want the INR below 2 while the patient was on IABP.
CT was negative for PE.
Hemoptysis resolved over the course of admission and hct was stable.
CRI : At admission, Cr was 2, above baseline creatine levels of 1.0-1.2.
Thought to be due to a component of small vessel/diabetic kidney disease in combination with the dye load from cardiac cath.
Creatinine trended down during the admission and patient was continued on his ACEI and lasix.
Cr at d/c was 1. .
UA showed blood in the urine but no WBC and Ucx grew out group B strep.
Anemia - Patient had a long history of anemia with baseline HCT 26-28.
Stools were guiac'd and hct was followed.
Hematuria   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Please have labs drawn for potassium, creatinine, magnesium and digoxin levels in one week.
Please have your INR checked withing 2-3 days since you are on Coumadin.
