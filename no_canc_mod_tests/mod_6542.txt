**FINAL REPORT [**2169-5-8**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2169-5-8**]):    NO GROWTH.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
CXR [**5-8**] FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-7**], the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed.
Emergent cardiac cath demonstrated LAD: 60% thrombotic in mid vessel, 90% thrombotic in diagonal original.
RCA 60% proximal patent stent, LMCA: clear.
Asymptomatic hypotension with SBPs in 90s prompted downtitration of Lisinopril 40mg to 20mg QD and Atrial Fibrillation with RVR prompted uptitration of metoprolol from 25mg [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Hospital1 **] to 75mg XL QD.
# PUMP: Previous echo showed LVEF>55 without focal wall motion abnromality in [**2162**].
Patient was monitored on telemetry.
Lipid panel in house total cholesterol of 113, LDL: 56, HDL: 49, Triglycerides 41. .
# Urinary Tract Infection: On Hospital day 3 patient with temperature to 101.
Urine culture returned after discharge with Coag + Staph and though sensitivites to ciprofloxacin was not performed, sensitivites demonstrated resistance to levofloxacin.
Decision made to hold medication until seen in follow-up and blood pressures monitored as outpatient.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: -- Monitoring of BP, re-institute BPD therapy if blood pressure allows vs use of alternative BPH medication without side effect profile of hypotension.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: -- GI follow-up with potential EGD/c-scope to investigate for etiology to normocytic anemia.
