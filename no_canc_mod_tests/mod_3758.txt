Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2195-7-17**]: Cardiac catherization with placement of bare metal stents to RCA.
[**2195-7-19**]: Cardiac catherization with placement of temporary pacing wire.
[**2195-7-27**]: cardiac catheterization with placement of a permanent pacemaker  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 20951**] is a 61 year old man with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, ?DM, atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), atrial thrombus who presented to his PCP's office today with bradycardia and hypotension.
Of note, he had been recently admitted and discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (3) 20952**]) for r/o MI with a diagnosis of GERD after a negative P-MIBI with EF 51% and negative serial cardiac enzymes.
On presentation to ED, VS: T 97.9, HR 30, BP 70s/50s, RR 17, O2 sat 95%.
Workup in ED was significant for atrial fibrillation with HR in 30s and hypotension (SBP 80).
The patient was also ?initially bolused with heparin (5000 units IV) and integrilin (20 mg) in the ED; however, these medications were subsequently discontinued prior to cath as INR was elevated.
Cath showed a total occlusion of the mid RCA with thrombus, which was stented with 3 bare metal stents.
Past Medical History: - Cardiomyopathy, possibly related to EtOH, with EF prior to MI of 51%-->35% post-MI - Diet controlled DM, last hemoglobin A1c 5.7% on [**6-22**] - Atrial fibrillation with tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia on statin - Insomnia - Alcoholism   Social History: Social history is significant for the [**2-11**] PPD tobacco use, down from previously.
Physical Exam: (At admission) VS: T 97.3, BP 112/60, HR 39 (sinus bradycardia), RR 21, O2 98% on FM (O2 flow 8) Gen: WDWN middle aged male in NAD, resp or otherwise.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; right femoral cath in place; 2+ DP Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP   Pertinent Results: EKG on admission demonstrated atrial fibrillation with HR in 30s and hypotension (SBP 80).
The LMCA, LAD, and LCX had no angiographically apparent disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic arterial blood pressure of 116/63 mm Hg.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-2-6**], the wall motion abnormalities are new.
The estimated PA systolic pressure is now mildly elevated.
Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed patent stents in the RCA.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures with RVEDP 19 mmHg and PCWP 30 mmHg.
The cardiac output was  depressed, with CI 1.7 L/min/m2.
[**2195-7-20**] Chest x-ray: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-19**], the patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration.
[**2195-7-20**] Chest x-ray: IMPRESSION: 1) Slight worsening of pulmonary edema in a patient with MI could suggest decompensated heart failure.
3) Transcutaneous pacer is in a satisfactory location and is uninterrupted  [**2195-7-21**] Chest x-ray:  FINDINGS: Bedside frontal chest radiograph is compared to [**7-20**], [**2195**].
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2195-7-10**] the slow regular rhythm is new.

Two days after his initial catherization, there was concern for new ischemia or re-stenosis based on EKG changes and  he underwent a second cardiac catherization, with placement of a temporary pacing wire.
EF in [**2193**] >55% on ECHO and EF 51% on p-MIBI [**6-/2195**]; post-MI echo showed EF 35%-40%.
The pacing was discontinued on [**7-21**], and his rate without pacing was 70s-80s and in atrial fibrillation.
Over the following days, he was noted on telemetry to have episodes of bradycardia to 40s, with pauses up to 2.5 seconds, and later developed periods of Afib with RVR to 150s.
He therefore had a permanent pacemaker placed on [**2195-7-27**],  Coumadin was reinitiated for target INR of [**3-15**].
# Valves: Post-MI echocardiogram showed [**2-11**]+MR, consistent with prior echos.
The patient was noted to have a baseline creatinine of 1.1.
In addition, his K+ remained elevated off of heparin, hemolysis labs were negative, he was noted to have a normal anion gap, and urine lytes showed appropriate excretion of potassium.
Stool guaiacs were negative.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Pts Hct stable and no further intervention done.
CIWA protocol was initiated but the patient did not require Ativan within the withdrawal window.
Medications on Admission: - Amlodipine 10mg daily - Metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **] - Folic Acid 1mg daily - HCTZ 25mg daily - Lisinopril 40mg daily - Ranitidine 150mg daily - Simvastatin 10mg daily - Trazodone 400mg QHS - Coumadin 2mg daily - ASA 81mg daily - Vitamin C 500mg daily - Multivitamin daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
Secondary diagnoses: - Coronary artery disease - Atrial fibrillation - Tachycardia-Bradycardia Syndrome - Diabetes Mellitus - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Insomnia   Discharge Condition: Stable, cleared by physical therapy as safe for discharge.
A temporary pacing wire helped keep your heart rate up, and then a permanent pacemaker was surgically placed to continue keeping your heart rate up.
