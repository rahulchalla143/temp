A repeat CT of the abdomen and chest on [**2128-2-25**] demonstrated no evidence of tumor recurrence at the ablation site and no evidence of new or concerning lesions elsewhere in the liver or lungs.
His blood sugars have been well controlled with the 68 of lantus at night.

[**2128-2-12**] Cardiac stress test - 1.
LFTs increased and a liver duplex was done showing relatively slowed acceleration times and low resistive indices, with waveforms suggestive of the possibility of hepatic arterial stenosis.
A CTA was then done noting marked focal kink and abrupt caliber change at the hepatic arterial anastomosis, narrowing at the portal venous anastomosis and an area of hypodensity in the liver transplant, which suggested a site of ischemia/hypoperfusion or perhaps early infarction, although the vast majority of the liver opacified normally.
Liver duplex on [**4-21**] showed improved flow within the hepatic arteries, with prompt systolic upstrokes, hepatopetal flow in the main and right portal veins.
Duplex of the liver revealed patent main, left and right portal veins with normal hepatic veins and hepatic arteries.
On [**4-25**], an ERCP was done with a stricture at the anastomotic site between the donor and recipient common bile duct, with mild extravasation of contrast seen at that site.
ERCP was repeated on [**5-5**] as his LFTs were trending upwards with alk phos at 715.
The plastic stent placed in the biliary duct with previous ERCP was found in the major papilla.
Given the new pancreatic duct dilation on CT a sphincterotomy was performed over the stent in the 12 o'clock position using a needle-knife.
An abdominal CT on [**5-7**] showed improved small-bowel obstruction with transition point in the mid right abdomen compared to [**2128-5-2**], although there was distention of mid small bowel loops with respect to the distal small bowel.
ABD CT was repeated on [**5-10**] showing Patent transplant vasculature with caliber change in the hepatic artery at the anastamosis due to size mismatch and partial small bowel obstruction.
Due to rising LFTs, a liver biopsy was performed on [**5-12**] with changes consistent with moderate acute cellular rejection with centrivenulitis,mild cholestasis.
He was enrolled in the Prograf study which involved treating rejection with higher trough prograf levels.
Prograf levels were high at that time (22 on [**5-13**]) already due to diarrhea that he was experiencing.
Although, he did experience a rising creatinine with creatinine increasing to 3.5 on [**5-19**] likely due to prograf.
On [**5-19**], he was taken to the OR for laparoscopy for persistent complaints of abdominal pain.
Blood and urine culture were sent with growth of Gram negative rods on blood cultures.
ABD CT was done on [**5-25**] showing new small bowel wall thickening possibly representing infectious or inflammatory process.
Of note, the picc tip culture was negative as well as urine and stool for C.diff.
An ERCP was performed noting mismatch donor/recipient size otherwise there was no leak/stenosis and the stent was removed.
On [**5-31**], a liver biospy was performed showing resolving rejection.
A CMV viral load was sent and is negative, as well as an HCV VL which is reported as 8,400,000 IU/mL.
Patient had calorie counts done which were very variable (700->[**2118**]).
