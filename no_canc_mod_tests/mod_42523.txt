Blood urine and stool cultures as well as two C. diff studies were normal.
A random cortisol was checked and found to be very low although this was drawn at midnight during the normal nadir so this was not conclusive for adrenal insufficiency.
When this returned an ACTH stim test was performed which showed lack of appropriate stimulation.
However this was also done overnight and she had low albumin which binds cortisol so this was also difficult to interpret.
She was started on stress dose hydrocortisone and her diarrhea improved, her blood pressures stabilized and she was weaned off pressors.
Because the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was not confirmed, her PM dose of hydrocortisone was held and an AM cortisol was rechecked was directed by endocrinology which was still low.
An ACTH level was sent but again the timing of this test led to an inconclusive result.
She was discharged with stable BP decreasing diarrhea and normal serum sodium levels on hydrocortisone 20mg QAM and 10 mg Qpm with endocrinology and PCP follow up.
Her sodium was 134 on this admission and she did not have significant hyponatremia during this admission.
Viral load on admission was ~2.4 million copies.
You were in the hospital because you had diarrhea, vomitting and low blood pressure that we believe is from adrenal insufficiency.
