Lung volumes are low, and there are bilateral small pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Echo ([**5-7**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
On [**5-9**] outside hospital cultures and sensitivities returned, with proteus mirabolis that was sensitive to ceftriaxone so his antibiotic regimen was changed from zosyn to ceftriaxone.
Patient's creatinine improved with volume resuscitation and was 1.1 at time of discharge.
He appears only slightly volume overloaded on exam on day of discharge with significant chronic bilateral lower extremity edema.
An echo was performed showing left ventricular hypokinesis with EF of 40%.
Continued scheduled nebs and supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations > 94%.
INR was subtherapeutic on presentation in setting of being held for microscopic hematuria.
Coumadin was restarted at a decreased dose with goal INR [**2-16**].
INR 1.8 on day of discharge.
Recommend monitoring INR on [**2135-5-20**] for adequate coumadin dosing.
INR trend up to 1.8 on day of discharge.
Recommend monitoring INR on [**2135-5-20**] and adjusting coumadin dosing accordingly to maintain goal INR [**2-16**].
Consider starting low dose ace inhibitor if further blood pressure control is warranted.
Blood pressure well controlled on day of discharge with lasix and metoprolol.

Because the kidney stone is still present you will likely require a procedure call lithotripsy to break up the stone after you have completed a two week course of antibiotics.
Your coumadin dose will be adjusted accordingly for goal INR [**2-16**].
