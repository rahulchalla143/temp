He had no lower extremity swelling, and his weight had been stable at his dry weight of 159 to 164 pounds.
On arrival to the Emergency Department, his temperature was 98.8, his pulse was 94, and his blood pressure was 140/80.
His INR was noted to be 20.6, for which he received 5 mg of oral vitamin K and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.
A urinalysis was consistent with a urinary tract infection, and he was started on ampicillin in the Emergency Department.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.7 8.
History of a right groin hematoma with pseudoaneurysm status post cardiac catheterization in [**2101-6-23**] 11.
History of congestive heart failure exacerbation in [**2101-6-23**], at which time cardiac catheterization demonstrated high filling pressures, both left and right-sided, with a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 32, global hypokinesis, and moderate pulmonary hypertension  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.6, pulse 79, blood pressure 142/59, respiratory rate 16.
His cardiac examination was irregularly irregular, with a soft II/VI systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border that radiated to the axilla.
His rectal examination was guaiac positive.
His neurologic examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, his white blood cell count was 10.7, his hematocrit was 36.9, platelets 300.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.4, BUN 63, creatinine 1.3, glucose 144.
His INR was 20.6, PTT 90.3.
His urinalysis showed 21-50 white blood cells, and his chest x-ray was clear.
An electrocardiogram on admission showed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 82, frequent premature ventricular contractions, a leftward axis, QRS complexes at 144 (intraventricular conduction delay), .
Following his resuscitation, Electrophysiology service was consulted, who felt the patient warranted an [**Month (only) 3941**] as a survivor of a sudden cardiac death.
Ischemia:  The patient had a cardiac catheterization in [**2101-6-23**] that demonstrated no flow-limiting disease.
His maximum troponin was 2.6.
c.  Pump:  The patient has non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, with right ventricular and left ventricular systolic dysfunction per echocardiogram on [**2101-6-27**].
His catheterization demonstrated high filling pressures with an RA of 25, a PA systolic pressure of 50, with a wedge of 32, cardiac index of 2.8.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of an INR equal to 20.
A nasogastric lavage was negative.
Given his cardiac issues were more active during this admission, there was no role for colonoscopy at the time of admission.
His hematocrits were stable upon discharge, and he will follow up with Gastroenterology as an outpatient.
Hematology:  The patient was supratherapeutic with an INR of 20 on admission.
It had subsequently come down following vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.
Metoprolol 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 95, heart rate less than 55 2.
Captopril 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 95 3.
The patient's INR should be drawn twice a week, as he is on Coumadin.
Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection.
His dry weight is 159 to 164 pounds.
Please check BUN, creatinine and electrolytes once per week and call physician if creatinine is greater than 1.7.
Please check finger sticks four times a day.
