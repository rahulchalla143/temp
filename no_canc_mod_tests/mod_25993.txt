Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF>50%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-5-15**], the pericardial effusion appears smaller.
RV systolic function cannot be compared due to poor RV visualization on prior.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background was diffusely slow and discontinuous with admixed theta and delta activity reaching maximal for 5-5.5 Hz with no anterior-posterior gradient.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A single EKG channel shows a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 78 bpm.

Wet Read: SJBj TUE [**2127-5-20**] 11:27 AM There is dehisence of the superior and inferior ends of the sternum.
Wet Read Audit # 1   Final Report INDICATION:  86-year-old man with post AVR and CABG on [**4-23**] with unstable sternum.
COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs [**4-28**] and [**2127-5-18**].
FINDINGS:  The initial CT tomogram confirms abnormal alignment of median sternotomy wires as identified on prior radiographs.
Dense material layers in the pericardial effusion likely representing blood products (2:46).
Lung volumes are low and severe respiratory motion hampers their assessment.
This exam is not tailored to evaluate subdiaphragmatic structures.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
He had echocardiogram that revealed large pericardial effusion and right ventricular compression.
His creatinine was elevated due to cardiac compromise with acute kidney injury and elevated troponin due to demand ischemia from cardiac strain.
He underwent echocardiogram as the drain had less than 50 ml, and based on echo finding the drain was removed, the remaining effusion was thought to be loculated.
On [**5-20**] he underwent a CT scan due to ongoing paradoxical breathing, Plastic surgery was consulted in regards to potential sternal plating or flap coverage due to dehiscence of the sternum.
Neurology was consulted he underwent MRI that did not reveal any acute findings and EEG that showed significant slowing which neurology felt he was unlikely to have a meaningful recovery.
There was a family meeting on [**5-28**] and the family wanted to continue treatment with plan for repeat EEG in 1 week.
The EEG was repeated and showed slowing, likely from anoxic brain injury.
Dyslipidemia Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Probable ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic systolic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.
Left antecubital nerve repair, right heel spur.
