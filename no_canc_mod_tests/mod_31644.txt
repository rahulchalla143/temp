Comparison is made to prior chest radiographs dating back to [**2117-2-25**] and prior CT dated [**2117-2-26**].
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS  FINDINGS:  Since most recent radiograph, there has been significant improvement to right- sided pleural effusion, now small in size with a persistent smaller left-sided effusion.
Calcification projecting over the lung apices likely is within vasculature as noted on prior CT examination.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through the brain with diffusion-weighted imaging.
The study is severely limited due to large amounts of patient motion artifact.
Severely limited examination due to the large amounts of patient motion artifact.
FINDINGS: The study is severely limited due to patient motion artifact.
IMPRESSION: Very limited examination with no change from the prior exam.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the brain was performed without IV contrast.
3D TOF MR angiogram of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] without IV contrast was also performed.
There are several small foci of increased signal intensity in bilateral cerebral white matter, on the FLAIR images, which could most likely represent sequelae of chronic small vessel occlusive disease.
On the gradient echo susceptibility weighted images, there is no evidence of hemorrhage.
3D TOF MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: Bilateral intracranial internal carotid, anterior cerebral artery on the right side, and bilateral middle cerebral arteries are patent and normal in caliber.
However, this can be confirmed with a repeat MRI with diffusion-weighted images, based on clinical discretion.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Aortic valve gradient is 8mmHg.
Remaining exam unchanged, normal aortic contours noted.
MRI with questionable occipital CVA.HIT screen sent for plt.
MRI [**3-16**] showed chronic microvascular ischemic changes.Tube feeds started [**3-17**] and NG tube removed [**3-18**].
