The ICD delivered ATP therapy which failed followed by a 34 joule shock which terminated the arrhythmia.
Neurology consult was requested with the conclusion that her transient disorientation was not neurologic in etiology but rather cardiac.

There are moderate, confluent hypodensities in the centra semiovale and periventricular white matter, consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel disease.
CXR [**2128-3-30**] FINDINGS: There is severe cardiomegaly and moderate vascular congestion, but no pulmonary edema.
ICD/Pacemaker leads end in the right atrium and right ventricle and coronary sinus, unchanged from [**2128-2-24**].
CXR [**2128-3-31**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increased in general lung density, likely to reflect pulmonary edema after cardiac failure.
CXR [**2128-4-1**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
CXR [**4-2**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-1**], the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
EKGs [**2128-3-30**] Predominantly ventricular pacing with a pacing artifact falling at the end of what appears to be a P wave, but also several non-paced QRS complexes of at least two morphologies, one of which suggests a fusion beat.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-2-24**], the overall rate is slightly faster.
Configuration of the paced beats is unchanged.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-4-1**] there is no significant change.
Brief Hospital Course: 55F with Hx of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%) with BiV ICD (replaced generator on [**2128-2-26**]), progressive mitral regurgitation, HTN, HL, obesity, presenting with acute onset of tingling on the right side of her face and right arm, found to have had multiple firings of her ICD for VF/VT.
TSH was normal, digoxin level within therapeutic range.
# PUMP:  The patient is known to have severe nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 25% with progressive MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], chronic systolic heart failure.
In [**2128-1-28**] she was admitted to this facilty with an acute heart failure exacerbation and her diuretics were increased.
# HLD:  [**2127-5-28**] total 172, LDL 111, HDL 34, TG 133.
# Dysuria:  [**4-4**] overnight the patient developed dysuria, UA showed signs of infection.
# Elevation of PT, INR:  Persistent elevation of PT (15-16) and INR (1.3-1.4) since [**2123**], PTT normal.
Transitional Issues: - follow left heel pain - potential workup of elevated PTT - consider sarcoid workup for underlying etiology of arrhythmia, ACE level pending - please follow EKG for QTc prolongation given concurrent therapy with digoxin, amiodarone, and mexiletine.
EKG Please do an EKG on Thursday, [**4-8**] to check QT interval.
Followup Instructions: Please go to [**Hospital1 **] to get blood work done on Thursday.
You will need a basic metabolic panel to check your potassium and creatinine as well as an EKG to check QT interval.
