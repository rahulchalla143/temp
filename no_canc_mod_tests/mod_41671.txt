In ED, her intial vitals were HR 60's BP 194/83 and EKG showed Q in III and aVF and inverted T's in II, III, aVF and V4-V6 with no ST changes.
HCT was 25, decreased from 32.8 on [**10-15**].
She was then transferred to F3 for further management.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.4 to 1.7.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS in ED: AF, SBP 190-204, HR 60-70, Sat 97% on 4L VS on floor: 98, 181/62, 55, 16, 100% on 4L  (SBP then 160) Gen: NAD, lying comfortably in bed, conversant through her daughter, who translated.
Palpation over lateral chest wall on L reproduces pain.

Multiple 3 mm noncalcified pulmonary nodules bilaterally, increased in number since prior exam dated [**2150-3-4**].
blood in sigmoid.
Improved from EKG on discharge ([**2155-10-15**]).
She was admitted to the cardiology service after a CT that was negative for dissection and a non-contrast abd CT that revealed no intraperitoneal process.
Repeated EKG's showed no changes c/w ischemia.
She was also known to have diffuse 3VD on catheterization.
EKG at this admission showed improvement from EKG at discharge from last admission.
Because her BP was 190-200 in the ED, she was started on an increased dose of metoprolol and hydralazine was added to her regimen.
Her BP was brought to the 120's overnight and in the morning, when the patient was seen to have had a baseline creatinine even after the dye load she received with her CTA in the ED, she was restarted on valsartan 80 (which was held at her last hospitalization for low BP).
During the first 2 days, the patient complained of mild TTP over her L chest wall, but no spontaneous chest pain.
Her EF in [**1-25**] was >65%, however her estimated EF in bedside echo at last admission immediately post-MI was around 50%.
Echo will need to be repeated as an outpatient in [**1-24**] weeks to evaluate her true EF post-MI.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was held at her last hospitalization for rising creatinine and low BP as stated above.
On day of discharge she had an episode of some lightheadedness with SBP of 76.
- Her BP should be monitored, as should her electrolytes (chem 7).
She should have INR checked frequently initially until her coumadin dose is set.
Creatinine on admission was better than baseline for the patient and did not rise significantly on the day after admission.
Her [**Doctor First Name 48**] was thought likely secondary to aggresive diuresis and further diuresis should be held until repeat electrolytes show improvement in creatinine.
CT abd showed no RP bleed.
She may also need repeated blood transfusions to maintain her HCT given her history of low HCT and 3VD.
She should have periodic monitoring of her HCT.
# Nausea: Pt has chronic hx of nausea with upper GI negative in [**2153**] per pt's daughter.
ASA 325 2.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: Four (4) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): Dose will need to be adjusted based on INR testing.
