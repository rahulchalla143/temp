On arrival to the ED, her vitals were: T 99.8 BP 93/60 HR 120 RR22 98%RA.
Labs were done which showed WBC 4 with 8% bandemia, Lactate 4.8.
CXR was negative, U/A not done as pt is anuric.
Blood cultures were drawn.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with flattening laterally.
A CVL was offered but the patient refused so an EJ was placed.

The differential was broad including line infection (new HD line placed on [**12-31**]), pneumonia (CXR without obvious infiltrate), CMV Viremia (viral load [**12-29**] negative), UTI, C. Diff (recent infection [**11-5**] but without any symptoms to suggest this).
BCx, C.Diff cx, and CMV viral load were also obtained and were negative.
It was not clear that the T wave inversions were rate related.
Recommend performing persantine study to r/o ischemia as an outpatient, not initiated as an inpatient given difficulty to instigate intervention in this setting with recent bacteremia and RUE thrombus.
EKG revealed sinus tach.
In terms of the etiologies of sinus tachycardia, she had evidence of volume depletion, especially after HD, which likely led to low systolic blood pressures in the 90s and sinus tachycardia.
However, after treatment with zofran and resolution of nausea, her heart rate remained in the 120s, which argues against that theory.
# Low Blood Pressure: Patient's baseline systolic blood pressure is 100s to 110s, though was noted to occasionally be in the 90s, which responded to small IVF boluses (250-300cc).
Repeated cardiac enzymes were negative.
# Anticoagulation: Patient should continue on coumadin with goal INR [**12-31**].
Digoxin 125 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q TUES, THURS, SAT ().
Warfarin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: goal INR [**12-31**].
For your fever, we did not find any source of infection, and your antibiotics was changed from linezolid to datpomycin because your blood counts went down on linezolid.
Please note that your medications have been changed: Please continue daptomycin until [**2150-1-26**] We have added digoxin We have added metoprolol We also added simvastatin Please continue to take coumadin Please continue to take valganciclovir until when you are seen in the infectious disease clinic next week ([**2150-1-21**])  Followup Instructions: Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1037**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2335**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] Date/Time:[**2150-1-21**] 11:10 Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1330**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2150-1-30**] 1:00 Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 2105**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 2106**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2150-6-18**] 10:00
