TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images through the head were obtained without contrast in the axial plane.
After intravenous administration of contrast, MDCT images of the head and neck were obtained in the arterial phase and axial plane.
MIPs, volume-rendered images, and curved reformats were generated and reviewed.
FINDINGS:  CT HEAD: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, vascular territorial infarction, edema, or mass effect seen.
CT C-Spine FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Evaluation of prevertebral soft tissue is limited due to ET tube placement.
