This was done as a elective procedure after he had episodes of amaurosis fugax in right eye few days ago which on evaluation shows BL significant (more than 80 percent) carotid stenosis.
At OSH, he was in sinus rhythm with a blood pressure of 195/81, and 100% on nasal cannula.
CT head shows left thalamic bleed about 2.5 cm.
Labs shows : CBC : 5.3-13.7/41-222, Chem 7 showed : Na 143, K 3.9, Cl 106, Co2 35, BUN 19, cr 1, glucose 109.
EKG did not show anything acute.
Fundus per admission exam - no papilledema.

Slight contraction in right hip flexion [**2-15**] and plantar flexion [**2-15**].

Radiology: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2119-12-13**] 1:14 PM FINDINGS: A 2.2 x 1.9 cm left thalamic hematoma appears stable when compared to prior CT from outside hospital imaged approximately four hours ago.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-12-13**] 12:52 PM IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
MR-HEAD: FINDINGS: Limited MRI study secondary to patient motion.
Only sagittal T1, axial T1, and axial FLAIR sequences were obtained, which were also markedly degraded by patient motion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal MRI study secondary to patient motion.
A repeat MRI study may be obtained after adequately sedating the patient.
CT head at OSH reveals an 18x22mm left thalamic ICH with minimal intraventricular extension and old left frontal infarct and no hydrocephalus.
Patient was noted to be hypertensive to 190s at OSH and on admission  BP 170s and started on IV nicardipine infusion which effectively controlled BP.
Exam in ED revealed R hemiplegia but it is unclear whether he was not putting in effort as 2 hours later he had some movement in R UE>LE.
He had a variable exam due to poor cooperation but was stable into [**12-14**].
His blood pressure was controlled with further increases in his lisinopril to 20mg daily.
He passed his swallow eval and was started on a regular diet.
Anticoagulation: repeat Ct did not show worsening basal ganglia hemorrhage.
HTN: will likely need BP med titration with goal SBP <140   Medications on Admission: Per wife home O2 1Liter Aspirin 81mg qd Claritin 10mg qd Finasteride 5mg qd Flovent 110mcg 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **] Ipratropium nasal spray 2 sprays each nostril PRN Lisinopril 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **] Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] Simvastatin 40mg HS Albuterol 2 puffs PRN Q4H  Discharge Medications: 1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for c. 2. lisinopril 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Imaging tests revealed a stroke with bleeding in your brain.
You were monitored in the intensive care unit while your high blood pressure was treated.
This will be ascertained with a repeat head CT in one week.
