[**2137-7-25**] Stress EKG (pharmacologic) IMPRESSION: No ischemic ECG changes.
# Hyponatremia: Presented with lethargy, sodium of 114, concerning for an acute on chronic process, as his records indicate a baseline sodium level of 125-130.
Renal was consulted, and he had a TSH and cortisol check, both of which were normal.
Sodium on discharge was 133.
- Continue to fluid restrict to 750cc/day, 2g Na restriction - Continue to hold diuretics for [**Last Name (un) **]  #Renal Failure: Acute on Chronic renal failure from baseline Cr of 1.4.
Creatinine finally improved with aggressive albumin resucitation and maximum doses of midodrine and octreotide.
24 hr urine collection showed CrCl 23 while creatinine was still elevated.
If renal function worsens again and cannot recover, may need repeat creatinine clearance, as if GFR <25 for 2 weeks he may be a candidate for combined liver-kidney transplant.
- Continue to hold diuretics - Continue midodrine 15mg TID PO - Follow up in transplant clinic as scheduled  # Cirrhosis: NASH cirrhosis s/p TIPS, cirrhosis complicated by HE, SBP, HRS,  MELD on transfer from MICU was 20, decreased to 15 at time of discharge.
EKG with no ischemic changes from prior.
Nuclear stress testing for transplant work up did not show any evidence of ischemic changes.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Cultures of peritoneal fluid from [**2137-7-30**] pending at discharge   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
