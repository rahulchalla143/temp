On [**1-2**] he spiked a fever of 101.9; blood cultures were positive for MRSA on [**1-2**] and group D enterococcus.
Initial urine cx with group D enterococcus; subsequent was negative.
His cyclosporine levels were elevated as well, which may have contributed to his renal failure.
His Cr at discharge was 3.3.
For his hypotension, autonomic testing confirmed orthostatic hypotension.
Multiple etiologies were entertained, including cervical cord compression (MRI showed C5-6 disc herniation and moderate spinal stenosis), hypovolemia, medication effects (he was on labetalol and prazosin at the time), and neuropathy.

The common bile duct tapers from a maximum of approximately 8 mm to 6 mm in the region of the pancreatic head which is incompletely visualized due to overlying bowel gas.
MICROBIOLOGY BLOOD CULTURES MRSA from outside hospital.
Enterococcus faecalis: [**Last Name (un) 36**] to amp, vanc [**2153-1-9**] [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans Subsequent surveillance cultures negative.

Further evaluation with MRI or CT scan is recommended.
# ID - POLYMICROBIAL BACTEREMIA, LINE SOURCE, ?GI source: MRSA, Enterococcus, [**Female First Name (un) 564**] from [**1-2**] blood cx and OSH blood cx, likely from R chest portacath that was removed soon after admission.
He had a RIJ TPL placed on [**1-11**].
His blood cultures started to become negative on [**1-9**].
On [**1-14**], a CT abdomen incidentally showed effusions and a CXR was done.
Given his lung pathology, his antibiotics were changed.
Fluconazole was continued for + Blood Cultures, daptomycin continued for MRSA as indicated for bacteremia, and Linezolid was started for possible abscess in lungs.
His blood cultures began to grow GNR so aztreonam was started.
He was empirically treated with flagyl for CDiff, but toxin testing was negative.
His last colonoscopy was in [**4-23**] and a polyp that was not malignant was removed.
Has chronic renal insufficiency (discharged with Cr of 2.4) from Alport's syndrome.
Renal U/S not complete as pt uncooperative but no hydronephrosis.
Cyclosporin levels were checked daily and the dose was beginning to be tapered because of his non functioning graft.
A RIJ TPL was placed the next day by IR under fluoroscopy.
After the patient's infections were under control, the temporary dialysis line was changed for a tunneled line.
#SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION Seen on MRI at C5/C6 level.
On day of discharge, his INR was 3.6 and should be held tonight.
He was initially kept on clonidine, labetalol, and amlodipine until his SBP dropped into 90's.
His BPs started to increase and his BP meds were added back on as needed.
On the floor, his blood pressures again decreased in the setting of a more active infection necessitating holding his BP meds.
As his pressures increased, the meds were added back on.
As discussed above his last colonoscopy was in [**4-23**] and he will need a repeat study within 1 year.
Hemolysis labs were also negative.
His HCT was monitored and he was given iron and epogen at dialysis  # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient was initially transfered to the unit for respiratory failure.
Labetalol 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): Hold for SBP <110, HR <55.
Amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): Hold for SBP <110.
INR of 3.6.
Please have your PT/INR checked at each dialysis session to insure that your levels remain therapeutic.
YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE COUMADIN on [**2-14**] AS YOUR INR TODAY IS 3.6.
Please start taking 2mg of coumadin on [**2153-2-15**] and have your INR drawn at HD on Friday [**2153-2-16**].
Your neurologic exam remained stable throughout your hospitalization.
You need a repeat colonoscopy because you have blood in your stool, but you refused to have this done as an inpatient.
