This prompted assessment with LSPINE MRI on [**2192-10-24**] for which he received Ativan for sedation.
The MRI revealed no evidence of epidural abscess, hematoma, or discitis, but marked epidural lipomatosis narrowing the caudal portion of the spinal canal and possibly compressing the thecal sac.
ABG obtained which revealed respiratory acidosis most likely from hypoventilation.
Initial ABG showed CO2 elevation.
Cr was monitored as ACE-I was increased and IV lasix was given with mild increase in Cr.
TTE was normal.
