Her blood pressure and hematocrit remained stable.
Incidentally she was noted to have a creatinine bump of 1.2 to 1.7 with a potassium of 6.0 while in the FI CU.
She was given Kayexalate, calcium gluconate and insulin plus D50 and her potassium corrected.
Bright red blood per rectum in [**2187-5-29**] seen in the Emergency Department with a stable hematocrit and sent home.

She had a chest x-ray, which showed an infiltration in the right lower lobe and compression of the left lower lobe.
Her hematocrit never    dropped below 44, however, she has an elevated hematocrit    at baseline.
Her blood pressure was stable in the Emergency Department,    but then dropped to the 90s while she was on the floor and    that led to her transfer to the FI CU.
Her blood pressure became hypertensive to    the 70s to 190s and her antihypertensives were restarted.
Acute renal failure:  Her creatinine was elevated and her    urine output decreased likely secondary to her prerenal    state.
