Due to concern over his overdose, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.
Of note, before transfer to [**Hospital1 188**], laboratories were drawn at [**Hospital6 5016**] which included a urine toxicology screen which was positive for amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and cocaine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission to [**Hospital1 **] revealed temperature of 98.8, blood pressure of 160/100, heart rate of 100.
His respiratory rate revealed the patient was on the ventilator on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation and pressure support with an FIO2 of 100%, respiratory rate set at 12, tidal volume of 700; on this, the patient had a spontaneous respiratory rate as high as 10 and had achieved an oxygen saturation of 100%.
His oropharynx revealed dried blood in the right nares where an nasogastric tube had been placed.
His chest revealed clear breath sounds bilaterally (per the Emergency Department note).
Heart examination revealed first heart sound and second heart sound with tachycardic rate, and a regular rhythm.
Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, and nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.
His extremities revealed there was no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurologic examination on initial presentation revealed the patient was sedated.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories from an outside hospital revealed a white blood cell count of 9.7, hemoglobin of 18, hematocrit of 53.4, with a mean cell volume of 91, platelets of 217.
He had a differential of 79.5% polys, and 13% lymphocytes, 5.7% monocytes, 1.5% eosinophils, and 0.3% basophils.
His Chem-7 at [**Hospital1 **] revealed a sodium of 143, potassium of 4.3, chloride of 107, bicarbonate of 25, blood urea nitrogen of 11, creatinine of 1, glucose of 120.
A serum toxicology screen here was negative.
Urine toxicology screen, per an outside hospital, as mentioned with positive benzodiazepines, positive cocaine, and positive amphetamines.
An arterial blood gas taken post intubation here revealed a pH of 7.32, PCO2 of 47, and a PO2 of 400.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray post second intubation revealed an elevated right hemidiaphragm with normal cardiac silhouette and contours.
Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital was remarkable for a normal sinus rhythm at 78, with normal intervals.
He did have an elevated creatine phosphokinase on admission (in the 1300-range) with a MB of 2.
The creatine phosphokinase did trend down to the 600s on the second day of admission, and his creatinine remained stable at 1.1; thusly ruling rhabdomyolysis.
He was offered voluntary psychiatric admission for his substance abuse, but he declined this at that time.
