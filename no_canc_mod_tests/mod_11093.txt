She continued to have a persistently elevated white count, and repeat infectious work-up revealed a normal urinalysis, normal blood cultures, but persistent large right pleural effusion which was felt most likely to be peripneumonic but continued to increase in size.
The breakdown of the fluid revealed a protein of 4.4, glucose 111, and LDH of 300, suggesting an exudative effusion which would be consistent with peripneumonic effusion as previously suspected.
The fluid was sent for culture and sensitivity which is pending at this time.
