Given her family history of CAD and patient's h/o HTN and recent fatigue with exercise, PCP ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] stress echocardiogram which indicated an anterior infarct.
Patient was then referred for cardiac catheterization.
She endorses occasional chest "pinch" which last 5-10minutes and only occurs at rest.
<br> Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -  Stress echo indicating anterior ischemia 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -  Asthma -  h/o TB, untreated -  relapse of meningioma, s/p resection [**4-/2105**], s/p 33 cycles radiation ending [**2108-1-26**] -  Factor V Leiden -  Glaucoma -  Depression -  mild-moderate right carotid artery stenosis -  h/o DVT in left leg ([**2099**]) -  s/p appendectomy [**2104**] -  s/p tubal ligation ([**2065**])   Social History: Patient lives in [**Location 11252**], NH - Tobacco history: Quit 40 years ago, smoked for approximately 7 yrs - ETOH:  [**11-28**] glasses of wine per day - Illicit drugs:  Denies current or history of use.
Family History: - Mother:  Peripheral vascular disease, CAD, h/o TIAs, DM - Father:  CAD h/o CABG, ALL   Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM VS: T= 96.5 BP= 136/64 HR= 80 RR= 12 O2 sat= 99%RA GENERAL: Well appearing female in NAD.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 3 cm.

DISCHARGE EXAM XXXXXXXXX   Pertinent Results: Admission labs: WBC-4.0 RBC-3.98* HGB-12.7 HCT-36.0 MCV-91 PT-11.4 PTT-24.2 INR(PT)-0.9  GLUCOSE-191* UREA N-18 CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-3.5 CHLORIDE-96 TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-16  ALT(SGPT)-19 AST(SGOT)-23 ALK PHOS-55 TOT BILI-0.3  Chol 222  HDL 117 LDL 96  TGs 43  Studies: Stress echocardiogram ([**2108-6-15**] at [**Location (un) 11252**] Cardiology): Questionable anterior septal ischemia, mild to moderate aortic insufficiency, aortic sclerosis without significant aortic stenosis, mild mitral insufficiency and tricuspid insufficiency, borderline pulmonary hypertension.
CXR ([**2108-6-28**]): No acute cardiopulmonary process.
ECG ([**2108-6-28**] on admission):  Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals.
Cardiac Catheterization: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal LVEDP and normal central aortic pressures.
Brief Hospital Course: REASON FOR ADMISSION 67 yo F with HTN, HL, recent stress echo evidence of anterior iscemia and h/o anaphylaxis to ASA presenting for aspirin desensitization prior to cardiac catheterization.
However, recent stress echo showed question of anterior septal ischemia.
Catheterization on [**2108-6-29**] showed no significant stenosis or lesions.
Hemoglobin was normal during recent outpatient labs.
# HTN: Blood pressure controlled at home with lisinopril-HCTZ.
BP was stable throughout admission.
