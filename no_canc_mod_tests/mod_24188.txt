The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-7-29**], the findings are similar.
Patient's sternotomy site continued to heal well and was regularly assessed by CT [**Doctor First Name **] throughout admission.
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions and sputum culture was notable for GNR so patient was started on an 8 day course for VAP with Vanc/Meropenem.
ETT was eventually pulled without complication and patient was transitioned to Bi-Pap for 2 days as o2 saturations remained low.
She also had a doppler venous study of the R extremity to r/o dvt, which was negative.
A HgA1c was checked and was 6.8.
She was transitioned to glargine and humalog with meals with improved blood sugar management.
