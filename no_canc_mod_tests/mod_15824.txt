Admission Date:  [**2147-10-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2147-11-5**]   Service:  [**Location (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization and stenting, status post ventricular fibrillation at rest with anterior wall myocardial infarction ([**2147-9-19**]) and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25% who presents from an outside hospital with cholecystitis status post cholecystotomy tube placement.
The patient's hospitalization was completed by complete heartblock requiring transcutaneous pacer placement, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia requiring implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement and congestive heart failure with ischemic cardiomyopathy and ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.
An abdominal computerized axial tomography scan and right upper quadrant ultrasound evidenced distended gallbladder with edema, stones, and sludge.
The patient continued with persistent abdominal pain and follow up abdominal computerized axial tomography scan demonstrated a subcapsular hematoma/bile collection.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by congestive heart failure, acute hematocrit drop to 21 requiring blood transfusion and acute progressive renal failure.
Coronary artery disease, status post catheterization 15 years ago, status post cardiac catheterization in [**2147-9-19**] with stenting of the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery; 4.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy with echocardiogram in [**2147-9-19**] demonstrating left atrial enlargement, aneurysmal apex, akinetic inferior, lateral and anterior wall with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%; 7.
Esmolol drip; 9.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed temperature 99.5, blood pressure 134/74, heartrate 90, oxygen saturation 97% on room air with a respiratory rate of 22.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric sclera, pupils equally round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact bilaterally.
Pulmonary examination, clear to auscultation bilaterally, anteriorly with no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
Abdominal examination, normoactive bowel sounds, distended, soft, diffusely tender to percussion and palpation with rebound, no masses appreciated.
Neurological examination is grossly intact.
LABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:  On transfer complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 11.6, hematocrit 28, platelets 200.
Chem-7 with sodium 137, potassium 3.0, chloride 101, bicarbonate 23, BUN 74, creatinine 1.7, glucose 103, calcium 7.3 with an albumin of 2.7, phosphate 4.1, magnesium 2.1, coagulation screen with PT of 13.1, INR 1.1, and PTT 25.8.
Urinalysis was notable for small blood, negative nitrites, 25 to 50 white blood cells, moderate bacteria, many yeast, 3 to 5 squamous epithelial cells.
Liver function tests with an ALT of 53, AST 32, alkaline phosphatase 186 and total bilirubin of 0.9.
LDH 319, amylase and lipase within normal limits.
Chest x-ray on admission was notable for cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, with increased vascular distribution in the upper lung fields consistent with congestive heart failure.
Bile cultures from the cholecystotomy tube without organisms on gram stain and cultures no growth to date.
Blood cultures from admission with no growth to date.
Abdominal and pelvic computerized axial tomography scan notable for normal liver with no ductal dilatation, moderate quantity of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis with hyperdense subcapsular fluid adjacent to the right lobe of the liver consistent with bile and blood.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable without transfusion.
The patient's abdominal examination was significant for abdominal distention with rebound and diffuse abdominal tenderness.
A follow up abdominal computerized tomography scan demonstrated perihepatic fluid collection secondary to a bile leak.
The patient's liver function test stabilized and trended down with no further surgical intervention.
A follow up abdominal x-ray revealed fecal impaction, however, the pain persisted despite evacuation.
A lactate level was checked on several occasions and remained within normal limits.
The patient's liver function tests continued to remain elevated, however, remained stable with no further evidence of recurrent cholecystitis.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were without growth, however, given the patient's abdominal pain and a Xylocaine demonstrating persistent bilateral lower lobe opacities, the patient was started on empiric Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient's creatinine progressively improved following transfer with diuresis and stabilized with a creatinine of 1.5.
Hematology - The patient had a rapid drop in her hematocrit at the outside hospital from an initial hematocrit of 29 to 30 to a nadir of 21.
The patient required transfusion at the outside hospital, however, since the time of transfer the patient's hematocrit has remained stable, greater than 30 without further transfusion requirement.
The patient's oxygen requirements decreased with diuresis, however, the patient continues with a persistent oxygen requirement of 2 liters by nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 88 to 90% on room air.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient has remained nothing by mouth on total parenteral nutrition and/or peripheral parenteral nutrition for the duration of the hospitalization.
