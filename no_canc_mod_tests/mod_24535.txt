Compared to the previous tracing of [**2195-2-22**] the ventricular ectopic activity is new.
GI was consulted and performed push enteroscopy on [**5-5**] with cauterization of a gastric angioectasia.
No other source of bleeding was identified and the GI team was able to visualize to the proximal jejunum.
Colonoscopy was not performed as he has had a reported negative study one year prior, but can be readdressed as an outpatient pending review of his OSH report if able to be obtained.
His hematocrit remained stable after transfusion and he was likewise hemodynamically stable.
Cirrhosis NOS - Portal HTN and Ascites.
