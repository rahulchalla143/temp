He rushed her to [**Hospital6 50929**] where she received a CT Head scan that was negative.
The medical team there pursued a lumbar puncture, but just after the study the patient experienced an episode of severe bradycardia and hypotension.
The LGH team repeated a NCHCT which was negative.

Radiology: CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT BRAIN PERFUSION Study Date of [**2125-12-8**] 1:33 AM CT HEAD: There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.
CT PERFUSION HEAD: Symmetric perfusion is identified bilaterally without evidence of regional areas of abnormalities in the transit time or blood volume.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD: CT angiography of the head demonstrates normal vascular structures in the anterior and posterior circulation without stenosis, occlusion, or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size.
However, MRI of the brain can help for further assessment.
IMPRESSION: Although CT angiography does not demonstrate vascular occlusion, a non-opacified portion of the distal right vertebral artery beyond posterior inferior cerebellar artery is seen which is likely due to hypoplasia of the right vertebral artery.
However, MRI can help for further assessment if clinically indicated to exclude ischemia or intrinsic abnormalities within the vertebral artery, which can be seen on the MRI examination.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-12-8**] 3:13 AM ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lungs are low in volume and show a left lower lobe opacity.
Chest Xray - 2 view: [**2125-12-12**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-8**], the patient has taken a much better inspiration.
MRI/MRA HEAD/NECK W&W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-12-9**] 2:35 PM FINDINGS: There is reduced diffusion seen in the right lateral medulla associated with abnormal T2 signal, suggestive of an acute infarct.
There is no signal abnormalities seen on the gradient echo sequence to suggest hemorrhagic component.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2125-12-10**] at 12:53:30 PM Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CTA/CTP head and neck showed no clear abnormalities.
CXR showed left base shadowing which was felt possibly related to atelectasis vs aspiration during her vomiting.
She had MRI/MRA head and neck which showed a right lateral medullary infarct with a PICA termination of right vertebral artery.
Fasting lipids revealed LDL 163 despite prior simvastatin therapy and was started on atorvastatin 80mg in addition to aspirin 325mg.
Echo [**12-10**] showed no VSD/ASD or PFO and otherwise demonstrated biatrial enlargement and trace AR.
She had borderline hypertension with SBP 140s-150s and was started on low dose lisinopril.
Her blood pressures ran slightly high during her stay and she was started on lisinopril 2.5mg po daily.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Colonial Heights Care and Rehabilitation Center - [**Hospital1 487**]  Discharge Diagnosis: right lateral medulla infarct high blood pressure hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions:  Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname 2427**], You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of vomiting, dizziness, and right-sided weakness.
You were at higher risk for this due to high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
Your cholestol was checked during your stay and your "bad" cholesterol, the LDL was high at 163.
Your blood pressures were slightly elevated during your stay.
