[**3-26**] CXR (PORTABLE AP) #2 FINDINGS: AP supine portable chest radiograph obtained.
[**3-26**] CXR - LINE PLACEMENT FINDINGS: AP supine portable chest radiograph obtained.
CXR [**3-27**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube, the pacemaker wires and the right central venous access line are unchanged.
CXR [**3-31**] FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart is enlarged.
Sputum culture grew only oropharyngeal flora.
On exam and CXR there appeared to be florid intrapulmonary volume overload, and the etiology of her decompensation was thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of tachycardia and poor diastolic cardiac function.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was then transferred to the CCU where she was briefly maintained on pressors for post-anesthesia hypotension (complicated by falsely low non-invasive blood pressures, when arterial access was obtained blood pressures were 20mmHg higher than non-invasive estimates).
