IMAGING: ======= [**2132-8-6**] Cardiac Echo (TTE) - The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-5-15**], the findings are similar.
[**2132-8-5**] RENAL U.S. - FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 13.5 cm and the left 12.0 cm.
[**2132-8-4**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - FINDINGS: There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with left pleural thickening.
A more nodular density measuring approximately 1 cm is noted in the right lung base which was not seen on prior exam and may represent the nipple.
Repeat study is recommended with nipple markers.
EKG: === [**2132-8-4**] - Sinus rhythm with atrial premature complexes; Consider left atrial abnormality; Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes; Since previous tracing of [**2132-8-3**], no significant change.

During his stay the patient remained without wheezes on exam and it was noted that LLL opacity was unchanged from prior x-ray several years ago.
He was discovered to have a history of esophageal spasm and this was felt to be a more likely explanation for the chest tightness.
GI was consulted and recommended evaluation as an outpatient.
He was noted to have low urine output and bladder scan showed 360cc residual.
The patient leaked around the catheter, the catheter eventually came out but he continued to have good urine output and post-void bladder scans were performed q4h to ensure he did not have high residual volume.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine 1.3-1.6 baseline and up to 1.8 at presentation.
A Renal U/S, to evaluate for hydronephrosis, was unremarkable.
# Hypertension: The patient was continued on his home dose of nifedipine and was changed from metoprolol succinate to tartrate on admission and his BP was well controlled initially.
At discharge, his BP was seen to be creeping back up (162/80) and his home dose of lisinopril was restarted, as his creatinine was back to the reported baseline.
# Diabetes mellitus - On admission the home Glipizide but this was discontinued and blood sugars covered with SSI and a diabetic diet was prescribed.
