She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51) and will have a final T & B cell class match prior to transplantation.
Vital signs were stable.
Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight 160 pounds.
She was placed on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.
Postoperatively, the patient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable renal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance of the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and resistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.
The ultrasound demonstrated that there was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted kidney.
Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to rule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence of right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
On [**2175-6-2**], WBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2.
Also on [**6-2**], PT was 13.5, PTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.
Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4, 100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.
It was decided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be continued.
The patient had another ultrasound on [**2175-6-6**] because there was blood in her [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.
Ultrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color, blood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.
Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral aspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal blood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to this area on a follow up scan is recommended to document interval change or resolution.
The patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting edema of right lower extremity greater than left lower extremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the right iliac artery.
One drain was eventually removed, continued on [**2175-6-12**] with drain output of 170, afebrile, vital signs stable.
This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2 and 3.
