Her initial EKG was normal sinus rhythm without any ST-T wave changes.
An echocardiogram the day after admission there revealed an ejection fraction of 20% and severe hypokinesis as well as critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.6 cm squared.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%.
Nitro paste 1" q.6h.
