The patient's family took him to [**Hospital **] Hospital for workup where vitals showed a temperature 101.3 degrees, heart rate 122, blood pressure 237/137, respiratory rate 48 and oxygen saturation 81 percent on room air.
At this hospital, EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a rate of [**Street Address(2) 33115**] depression in V5 through V6.
CT scan was reported as negative for PE or effusion.
However, chest x-ray showed extensive bilateral infiltrates.
The patient was then transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department, his temperature was 96.8 degrees, blood pressure 123/86, heart rate 83, respiratory rate 28 and oxygen saturation 97 percent on a nonrebreather.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 83 and no ST-T wave changes.
The patient was then transferred to the [**Last Name (un) 19424**] Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Therefore, patient underwent an ablation at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2114-3-19**].
The patient underwent an ETT-MIBI in [**2111**].
He exercised for 9.5 minutes on the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol with an EF of 51 percent.
Diovan/hydrochlorothiazide 160 mg/25 mg, 1 tablet q.a.m.,    and [**11-24**] a tablet q.p.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.5 degrees, heart rate 80, blood pressure 139/77, respiratory rate 25, oxygen saturation 93 percent on a nonrebreather.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 15.2, hemoglobin 10.5, hematocrit 30.2, and platelet count 246.
PT 14.4, PTT 39.3 and INR 1.4.
Reticulocyte count 3.
Chemistries:  Sodium 137, potassium 4.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 21, BUN 29, creatinine 1.3, glucose 176, CK 66, troponin 1.65, vitamin B12 250, folate 19.5, ferritin 469, TRF 221, and TSH 0.58.
Chest x-ray:  Findings could be consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema secondary to CHF superimposed on emphysema.
After the initiation of antibiotics and mild diuresis, patient's oxygen saturation improved dramatically.
Blood, serum, and Legionella antibody cultures were obtained.
The patient will need outpatient pulmonary function tests as an outpatient when he is fully recovered.
In addition, he was anticoagulated with Coumadin with a goal INR of [**12-26**].
His troponins were elevated secondary to the recent ablation but had been trending down.
On [**2114-3-26**], an echo was obtained to further evaluate the patient's cardiac function.
The patient was incredibly reluctant to take nonsteroidals for his pain as he had an increase in his creatinine while on these medications in the past.
Renal failure:  Overall, the patient's creatinine was near baseline during the admission.
However, it became elevated following his CTA on [**2114-3-25**].
Iron studies were obtained.
He should have a repeat chest x-ray at that time.
If this has not returned to baseline, a repeat CT of the chest should be considered.
