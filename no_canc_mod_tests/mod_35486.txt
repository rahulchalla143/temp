Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Patient initially had some nausea, chest pressure and headache following arrival in CCU, but EKG was unchanged from pre-cath EKG (no LBBB) and symptoms resolved with anti-emetics and rest.
Post-cath check was unremarkable, and over the next 24 hours of admission the patient's cardiac enzymes trended up, peaking at CK 529 and Troponin of 0.58.
On [**2101-6-2**] the patient had an echo that showed a LVEF of 50-55%.
#Anemia:  Patient was noted to be anemic and was transfused 2 units packed RBC's on night of admission and on morning laboratories found to have an elevated TSH with a suppressed free T4, suggesting hypothyroidism as the etiology of her anemia, as iron studies, folate and B12 were normal and stool guaiacs were negative.
You likely suffered a heart attack and you underwent cardiac catheterization where we have treated the blockages with angioplasty and stenting.
Followup Instructions: Primary Care Doctor: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 40075**] on Thursday [**6-16**] at  10:45.
