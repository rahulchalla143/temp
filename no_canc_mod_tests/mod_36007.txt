However, she became more distended and the decision was made to return her to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy.
WBC further increased to 21 on [**6-23**].
A CT chest/abdomen was performed to look for a source of infection; none was found.
Sputum cultures drawn [**6-19**] grew Pseudomonas & Klebsiella.
Urine cultures from [**6-27**] grew yeast, and caspofungin was added.
On [**6-29**], patient's Hct dropped from 28.2 to 16.7.
She underwent a non-contrast CT scan which revealed a large retroperitoneal hematoma with abdominal fluid.
Cultures were negative.
A duplex renal ultrasound showed lack of diastolic flow.
On [**7-5**], her NGT output was bloody/coffee grounds emesis.
She underwent EGD on [**7-5**], which showed ulcers in the lower third of the esophagus and in the fundus, as well as erosion in the stomach.
Colonoscopy showed an ulcer in the rectum, and an otherwise normal colon up to the sigmoid.
On [**7-24**], she underwent a repeat bedside swallowing evaluation, and she was cleared for a thin liquids/pureed solids diet with continued PEG tube feeds for nutrition.
She will eventually need a colonoscopy, which can be performed an an outpatient basis.
