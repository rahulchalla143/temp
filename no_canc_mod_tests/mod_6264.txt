EKG was notable for QRS 202 with RBBB and LAFB.
With 2 units of pRBCs, repeat Hct was 22.8.
Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, Hct was 23.2, Cr was 6.2 with K of 6.7.
NGL was completed and showed ?coffee grounds.

In total, pt received 5u PRBC's (3 at outside, 2 here), 2u FFP, 1u Plts and Vitamin K for INR 5.7 at OSH.
Hct was 23.2 on admission, was hemodynamically stable by MICU admission after resuscitation, Hct's were trended.
He received 2u PRBC's after the procedure (5 total) and no further bleeding was seen, and his Hct stabilized.
Hct reached as high as 29.3 during the admission and he was discharged with a stable Hct of 28.4.
He will follow-up with INR monitoring and general anticoagulation with his PCP Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16258**] on [**2111-9-9**].
Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.5-1.9, was 6.2 with K 6.7 on ED evaluation.
Renal was consulted who saw muddy brown casts indicating ATN likely from severe hypotension with 80/40s BPs and acute anemia with nadir HCT 17 range.
He was making good urine and his urine output was nearly balanced with intake fluids (clinically euvolemic), suggesting that these medications would be well tolerated by his kidneys and put him closer back to his home regimen.
There was also some initial concern for QRS prolongation on EKG in the setting of hyperkalemia , however, he has a fascicular block at baseline and his QRS was at baseline.
Os-Cal 500 + D 500 mg(1,250mg) -200 unit Tablet Oral 19. warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day: Pt received 2mg coumadin prior to discharge [**8-19**].
INR should be checked in [**3-5**] days, then regularly for INR goal [**3-5**].
On endoscopy, the GI doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24997**] lesion that was actively bleeding.
In addition, your creatinine was significantly elevated when you arrived at the hospital, suggesting that you were in acute renal failure.
Both your creatinine and potassium have now come down nicely to their appropriate baseline levels.
Your heart rate and blood pressure since have been in the appropriate ranges and we will be recommending and sending you home on the same dose of Metoprolol.
