A left-sided transvenous pacer/fibrillator is present with atrial ventricular and coronary sinus leads in situ unchanged in location in this single view and compared with the prior study of [**2165-5-2**].
COMPARISON: Abdominal CT of [**2163-5-5**] is available for correlation.
ECHO Conclusions: The left ventricular cavity is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (basal septum and basal anterolateral wall contracts best).
The patient underwent a renal ultrasond of his transplant which was unreavealing.
