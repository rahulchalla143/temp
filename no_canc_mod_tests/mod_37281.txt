The patient went to the Emergency Department at an outside hospital where her systolic blood pressure was in the 160s.
She received Lopressor for her blood pressure, and a head computed tomography showed a small acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern and fourth ventricle.
Reportedly, all of those tests were negative (per the patient).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed vital signs with a temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure was 160/80, heart rate was 74, respiratory rate was 11, and her oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
Neurologic examination revealed was alert, awake, and oriented times three.
Cranial nerve examination revealed the pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light; 2.5 mm to 2 mm bilateral.
Motor examination revealed bulk was normal.
The remainder of the examination on the lower extremities was normal.
Coordination examination revealed she had a positive resting tremor.
Reflexes were 2+ throughout.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Her prothrombin time was 10.8 and partial thromboplastin time was 26.8.
Her white blood cell count was 8, her hematocrit was 38, and her platelets were 295.
Her systolic blood pressure was to be kept at less than 140 with a Nipride drip.
The patient was slightly more confused, and her repeat computed tomography showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage with hydrocephalus.
The patient had a angiogram later that day on [**7-7**] which was negative for any kind of aneurysm or bleeding that could be seen from a vessel.
On postoperative day one on [**7-8**], her intracranial pressures were in the 8 to 15 range.
Her CPP was 82 to 72.
Her head computed tomography showed good placement of the ventriculostomy drain.
The patient was requiring hydralazine, captopril, and metoprolol to maintain her blood pressure at less than 140.
Her INR was 1.2.
Her captopril was increased on [**7-11**] to maintain her blood pressure at less than 160.
During the time when her ventriculostomy drain was in, she was no prophylactic vancomycin.
Her blood pressures were in the 130s systolic and 50s to 70s diastolic.
A repeat computed tomography did not show any hydrocephalus.
On [**7-16**], the patient had an angiogram done which showed no bleeding or evidence of aneurysm.
which kept her systolic blood pressure at greater than 120.
