Of note, AFB smears were negative as well as BAL.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-26**] for further management and here he was started on a ten day course of vancomycin/meropenem for a cavitary pneumonia although sputum cultures were largely negative.
On the day of admission, he developed some mild lightheadedness and was noted to have hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 60's to 70's, not responsive to 1500 cc of IV fluid.
The blood pressure was 78/40 with an initial lactate of 4.8 and he was then treated per sepsis protocol.
An IJ was placed with CVP initially at 215 and a mixed venous O2 sat monitor was placed and were showing sats in the mid 70's.
Blood pressure is 101/35.
Pulse is 85.
Respiratory rate is 20 and 100 percent on nonrebreather.
His cardiovascular examination shows faint heart sounds and is difficult to appreciate.
His abdominal exam is benign.
LABORATORY:  Labs on admission show a white count of 27.8 which is up from the last time at 18.7.
Hematocrit is 33, platelet count of 144.
His chemistry is sodium 138, potassium 4.7, chloride 103, bicarb 22, BUN 43, creatinine 1.6.
AST is 16 and ALT is 18.
Alkaline phosphatase is 78.
Total bilirubin is 0.7.
His albumin was 2.7 and lactate was 4.8 subsequently improving to 1.6 after fluid resuscitation.
He had a chest x-ray on admission showing persistent right upper lobe opacity with question of a possible pneumonia when compared to prior chest films.
All blood cultures remained negative.
Urine culture remained negative.
He had C. diff sent which was positive.
His sputum ultimately grew out Stenotrophomonas, pen- resistant with only intermediate sensitivity to Levaquin.
1, the patient's blood pressures were well over 100 and attempts were made to begin weaning off his Levophed.
Meanwhile, his mixed venous oxygen saturations were well above 70 percent during the majority of his hospital course.
Although the patient was treated for presumed sepsis, later on it was slightly unclear as to the etiology of the patient's hypotension and whether the patient was truly septic as blood cultures and urine cultures remained negative and sputum grew back bacteria only later on during his hospital course.
Other sources for hypotension were sought after including cortisol levels which were normal.
He ruled out for an MI by cardiac enzymes and then later had an echocardiogram initially to rule out pericardial effusion but which did show a new depressed ejection fraction of 25-30 percent compared with previous values of an ejection fraction of approximately 40 percent.
Later during the hospital course, the patient initially came in in sinus rhythm and on EKG developed rapid atrial flutter into the 150's.
He was refractory to both diltiazem and beta blockade, but later was started on amiodarone which resulted in conversion back to sinus rhythm with heart rates back into the 60's and 70's.
Given the fact that his ejection fraction had decreased with signs of cardiomyopathy consistent with rate related tachycardia, one of the concerns was that the patient had become hypotensive in the setting of rapid rates.
He was later placed on a Lasix drip and diuresed nearly 4-6 liters over the span of the later course of his hospitalization with subsequently markedly improved blood pressures.
However, blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.
As mentioned above, his sputum did grow out Stenotrophomonas which is pen-resistant.
Initially, given the patient's hypertension, the patient was felt to be mildly dehydrated and his creatinine did improve with aggressive IV fluid resuscitation.
Since being placed on IV Lasix drip, the patient has had excellent diuresis, although his creatinine has not fallen back completely to baseline.
His creatinine should be monitored over the next couple of weeks especially with the addition of an ACE inhibitor.
He was also coagulopathic with an INR of 1.6-1.7.
His platelet count now is in the 90's.
His thyroid studies suggest possible hypothyroidism with a decreased free T4.
