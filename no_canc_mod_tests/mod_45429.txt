Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 540**]                         Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 10258**]  Admission Date:  [**2150-4-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2150-4-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2087-1-10**]     Sex:  F  Service:  #58  FURTHER HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was not discharged on [**2150-4-15**] because her white blood count was slightly increased.
The patient had a repeat abdominal CT scan here on [**4-16**] to evaluate the possible right liver mass noted on right upper quadrant ultrasound and right kidney lesion, in order to rule out abscess or other perinephric fluid collection.
The patient's abdominal CT scan showed:  1.
The patient also had repeat blood cultures that were "no growth."
She also had a C. difficile assay sent to rule out C. difficile colitis as the cause of her persistent elevation of her white blood cell count.
The last nephrostomy bag still had some faint pink tinge to the otherwise clear urine.
At the time of discharge, her white blood count was still 19.
It was expected that her white blood count should continue to improve minimally, and would improve significantly after stone extraction by Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 10259**].
The patient's white blood cell count is turning down.
