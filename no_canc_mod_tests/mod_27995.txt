Upon presentation, she was found to be hypotensive with her systolic blood pressure in the low 90's.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, her temperature was 99.9 with a heart rate of 99 and normal sinus rhythm; blood pressure 91/51 not on any pressor agents.
Respiratory rate of 18.
Her saturation was 98% on assist control of 50% FI02, 530 by 20 and a PEEP of 5.
Her abdominal exam was non distended with normoactive bowel sounds and soft and nontender throughout.
Extremity exam revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurologic exam revealed normal tone in all the extremities.
An incision was made in the inferior aspect of the breast and a small amount of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] fluid was obtained that was sent for culture.
Tissue from the breast was also sent for culture as well as biopsy at this time.
Of note, at this time, her laboratory values revealed a likely compromise of renal function with a creatinine of 2.0 on postoperative day number one.
She had been admitted with a creatinine of 1.9 with no known baseline.
At this point, we had an identification of organisms as gram positive cocci but was still awaiting speciation at this time.
She was maintained with a urine output of approximately 30 ml an hour and was continued on the antibiotics.
She had chest x-rays that revealed her to likely to be in ARDS versus pulmonary edema but she was maintaining her urinary output at this time.
The enzymes were elevated at this time with a troponin T peaking at 0.51 initially and a CK MB fraction of 9.8.
We followed these enzymes serially as they decreased during this time to 0.32 the following day.
On [**2151-3-1**], the patient received an echocardiogram that revealed a normal left ventricular function.
Her urine output continued to be marginal at this time.
Also checked during this time were thyroid and hormone levels which revealed her free T4 to be 0.5 which was decreased, leading to a possible thought of this being a failure of the pituitary and the adrenal access having failed the cortisone stimulation.
Her acidosis was attempted to be corrected with bicarbonate solution; however, the patient did not respond.
