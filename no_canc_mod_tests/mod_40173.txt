Imaging: [**2129-10-11**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.
Further evaluation with pelvic ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis.
EGD [**10-12**]: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
After the EGD scope was passed to the second part of the duodenum a colonoscope was inserted to visualize the distal duodenum to assess the area bleeding that was suggested on CT scan.
Impression: Small hiatal hernia Erythema and erosion in the stomach body Abnormal mucosa in the duodenum likely Brunner's gland hyperplasia Otherwise normal EGD to fourth part of the duodenum Recommendations: The findings do not account for the symptoms Plan for capsule study after EGD Patient should have a repeat EGD to biopsy nodules seen in duodenal bulb .
jejunum: The endoscopic was advanced into the 4th duodenum / proximal jejunum - detailed exam was not possible due to patient intolerance / discomfort with procedure.
No large lesions or blood was noted.
Limited exam of the third / fourth part of the duodenum - no bleeding lesions were noted.
# GI bleed: The patient experienced a significant bleed with a Hct drop of approximately 10 points(28->19) in the setting of INR 7.
He then underwent CTA showing active bleeding within the fourth portion of the duodenum.
She received a total of 5 units of pRBCs, 2 units of FFP and 10mg IV vitamin K with improvement in her hematocrit and reversal of her INR.
