Labs were significant for troponin 3.79, creatinine 1.1, hematocrit 41.
In cath lab she had a wedge of 28 with a V wave of 40 left ventricular end diastolic pressure measured 24.
Left circumflex showed 60% stenosis OM1, RCA with 90% proximal PDA and 95% RCA before PDA with avulsed plaque and thrombus as well as 70% stenosis of mid RCA.

EKG prior to the catheterization as below with ST elevations inferior leads with 0.5 to 1 mm and 3 mm depression in anterior leads as well as T wave flattening laterally.
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation in lead 3 with biphasic T waves inferiorly, ST depression of 2 mm anteriorly with early R wave progression as well as T wave inversions.
Echo at the bedside was done and showed no flail leaflet.
Cardiac catheterization showed pulmonary capillary wedge of 20 and ejection fraction of more than 60.
Cardiac echo done on [**2-6**] showed mild dilation of left atrium, LVEF more than 55%, mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets and mitral valve leaflets as well as trivial pericardial effusion.
