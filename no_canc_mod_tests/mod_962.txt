A chest x-ray there showed likely aspiration pneumonia and fingerstick glucose was noted to be 30 with an oxygen saturation of 77% on room air.
His systolic blood pressure was in the 60s to 70s and then he was placed on a Levophed drip with increase in the blood pressure to a systolic blood pressure to the 90s.
His temperature was noted to be 103 with course rigors.
In terms of his insulin regimen, he did take NPH at his standard dose the night prior to admission and he was noted to be "shaking" by the registered nurse with a fingerstick glucose of 40 as described above.
Esophageal varices with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2198-3-1**] demonstrating Grade 1 varices, portal gastropathy, duodenitis, status post banding of Grade [**1-2**] varices in [**2195-10-31**] and [**2196-9-30**].
Colonoscopy on [**2198-3-5**] with sigmoid and descending colic polyps.
Stress echocardiogram in [**2196**] showing an ejection fraction of 65% and no evidence of ischemia.
Last hemoglobin A1C 6.9 on [**2197-12-6**].
Ask-upmark kidney (unifocal reflex nephropathy, status post left nephrectomy).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.8 rectally.
Blood pressure 96/49 increasing to 115/54.
Baseline blood pressure from prior records was noted to be systolic in the 90s.
Heart rate 70 and regular.
Oxygen saturation 95% on 15 liters nonrebreather face mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, moist mucous membranes, prominent anasarca.
Abdomen distended, nontender, dull to percussion with a positive fluid wave bilaterally.
Rectal exam in the Emergency Room:  Brown guaiac positive stool.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6.3 with a differential of 82% neutrophils, 50% bands, 3% lymphocytes, hematocrit 39.5, platelet count 94,000.
INR 1.7.
Chemistries:  Sodium 142, potassium 4.6, bicarbonate 107, BUN 26, creatinine 11, 1.1, 117.
AST 55, ALT 20, total bilirubin 3.9, alkaline phosphatase 67, albumin 3.4, amylase 134, lactate 2.4.
Levophed was titrated to a mean arterial pressure greater than 60.  his Lasix, Aldactone and propanolol were held.
Blood cultures (final report) showed no evidence of bacteremia.
The septic shock was thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia, although, the chest x-ray was significant only for mild left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
A urinalysis was negative for urinary tract infection.
Stool cultures, Clostridium difficile and sputum cultures are all negative at the time of dictation.
The vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl were stopped on [**3-11**].
The propanolol was not restarted at the recommendation of the Liver Service given the patient's lower extremity edema and only Grade 1 varices.
Gastrointestinal bleed:  Initially the patient was noted to have a hematocrit drop from 39 to 28 in the Emergency Room.
The patient's hematocrit was 30.8 on [**2198-3-14**].
It did range from a nadir of 22.9 to a maximum of 39.5.
Decreased urine output:  Initially the patient had decreased urine output, and there was some concern for hepatorenal syndrome, however, after aggressive fluid resuscitation, his urine output returned to [**Location 213**] with greater than 1 cc/kg/hour of urine output.
SVP:  The patient did have a history of SVP and a paracentesis was performed on [**2198-3-9**] which showed no evidence of SVP.
The acidic fluid contained 345 white blood cells, 275 red blood cells, 6% polys, 29% lymphocytes, 23% monocytes, 9% mesothelial cells, 33% macrophages and was felt to be negative for SVP.
with further monitoring in the outpatient setting for effect, titrated up as tolerated.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition/metabolic acidosis: Initially the patient had a primary metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic acidosis secondary to septic shock with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
Please hold for systolic blood pressure less than 100.
Please hold for a systolic blood pressure of less than 100.
He is advised to inform his doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2449**] of any confusion, chest pressure, shortness of breath, palpitations, edema, fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.
