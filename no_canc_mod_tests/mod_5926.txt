A cardiac catheterization performed at that time showed 50% left anterior descending lesion, 70% obtuse marginal lesion and an ejection fraction of 51%.
According to a report, the patient had a stress echocardiogram performed in [**State 108**] which showed no change from his previous findings.
Prior to admission, the patient had a cardiac catheterization performed on [**2200-11-14**].
That cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
Ejection fraction was not assessed at that time.
LABORATORY:  On admission, hematocrit 36.8, white blood cell count 4.4, platelets 187.
Glucose 69, BUN 36, creatinine 1.3, sodium 139, potassium 4.9.
EKG performed on [**2200-11-14**] showed sinus bradycardia with a probable anteroseptal infarction with undetermined age, left ventricular hypertrophy but no change since previous EKG.
Vital signs are temperature 98.2 F.; heart rate 76; blood pressure 139/69; respiratory rate 18; 95% on room air.
HEENT examination within normal limits.
Heart examination regular rate and rhythm; no murmurs.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurologic examination grossly intact.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   Prior to admission, the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.
His urine output was adequate.
His hematocrit on postoperative day one was 25.8.
His blood sugars were noted to be slightly elevated and he was maintained on insulin and titrated appropriately.
His blood pressure and heart rate remained stable.
His hematocrit on postoperative day four was 27 with creatinine of 1.6, which is basically his baseline.
