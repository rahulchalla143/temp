Brief Hospital Course: # Dyspnea: Patient with weight gain, lower extremity edema, CXR consistent with volume overload, BNP elevated to >[**Numeric Identifier 7923**] therefore likely acute on chronic dCHF exacerbation [**2-15**] stopping carvedilol and Valsartan.
PE unlikely with INR of 6.9.
Also empirically treated for pneumonia with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin though this was stopped when the patient remained afebrile without leukocytosis and repeat CXR did not show any underlying infiltrate.
ECHO was checked and showed no change from prior.
Urine output was between 40 and 80 per hour initially but this trailed off after about 2 days, and was only about 1.5 liters negative.
She was initially dyspneic, but as she continued to undergo dialysis, her respiratory status improved and on the day prior to discahrge she began satting 95% on RA.
Urine Culture showed #######.
Her coumadin was restarted when the INR trended down and then held again because it trended up to 3.1.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
