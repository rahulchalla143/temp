Patient was reportedly found on the street in a confused and disoriented state by emergency medical technicians and subsequently brought to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation and management.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be disoriented and confused with a CPK of 5712 and a [**Hospital1 **] of 20.
Patient's electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 112, inferior lead Q waves, and mild ST depression in lead V5.
In addition, the patient was noted to have an [**Hospital1 **] white blood cell count of 17.4, but was noted to be afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
The patient continued to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status in the Emergency Department, after which point he received head CT scan which was negative and a lumbar puncture which demonstrated 560 red blood cells and 1 white blood cell.
A bedside echocardiogram was performed, which demonstrated hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of approximately 30% and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Initial Cardiology recommendations advised conservative management with a beta blocker, but no Heparinization given the patient's lumbar puncture results.
The patient was subsequently admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit team for further evaluation and management.
Given the patient's presenting symptoms and his lumbar puncture results, a neurosurgical consult was obtained and the patient was referred for head MRI/MRA which subsequently demonstrated no gross structural abnormalities and no evidence of infarction or intracranial enhancement.
The patient was subsequently restarted on his outpatient seizure and Parkinson's medications to good effect.
While on the floor, the patient demonstrated several episodes of acute shortness of breath and tachypnea subsequently ascribed to transient panic attacks that the patient stated were consistent with his normal baseline.
On [**2189-4-3**], the patient underwent a repeat echocardiogram, which demonstrated severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 25% and 4% mitral regurgitation.
The patient subsequently recommended for a cardiac catheterization, which he underwent on [**2189-4-6**], which subsequently demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease with 70% proximal irregular stenosis of the left anterior descending artery, total occlusion of the circumflex, and total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery.
In addition, the patient's cardiac catheterization demonstrated moderate right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, moderate primary pulmonary hypertension, and a depressed cardiac index of 1.8.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with a bypass time of 122 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 79 minutes.
Patient's pericardium was left open; lines placed included an arterial line, Swan-Ganz catheter, CVP catheter, and IAVP; both ventricular and atrial wires were placed; mediastinal and right and left pleural tubes were placed intraoperatively.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the CSRU, intubated, further evaluation and management.
On transfer, the patient's mean arterial pressure was 80, his CVP was 19, his ......... was 15 and his [**Doctor First Name 1052**] was 25.
On postoperative day #6, a routine chest radiograph demonstrated evidence of a left basilar infiltrate versus atelectasis; the patient was subsequently begun on levofloxacin for a 10 day course to be completed as an outpatient.
