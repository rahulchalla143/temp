Laboratories at this OSH revealed a creatinine of 2.1 (from baseline of 1) and elevated ESR of 105.
MRI spine was performed and revealed abscess at L2-L3 level with phlegmon L4-L5-S1, no cord compression.
Blood cultures from [**2140-6-7**] from OSH grew gram negative rods, which were pan-sensitive and gram positve cocci.

[**2140-6-10**] ECHO Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The CIWA scale was discontinued on [**2140-6-11**] when the patient become somnolent.
Epidural abscess/Bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**2140-6-10**] showed gram (-) rods and grew S. Marcescens.
Subsequent serial blood cultures were negative.
There was a question of endocarditis as the source for seeding; however, there was no notable murmur on exam and a TTE failed to show any valvular abnormalities.
EKG did not show any abnormalities.
Iron studies appeared to be c/w anemia of chronic disease.
HCT remained stable after 1 unit of PRBCs on [**2140-6-8**].
