CXR showed CHF.
tnI was 0.06 9nl 0.03, CK 315.
BNP was 1870.
ABG was 7.10/73/88.
Cath in [**4-18**] showing SVG-RPL-RPDA occluded and SVG to D1 occlusion.
Repeat cath in [**4-18**] showed acute stent thrombus in SVG-D1; restented.
Cath [**5-19**] showed total occlusion of SVG-D1.
Cath [**4-20**]: 90% distal RCA tx c [**Month/Year (2) **], 50% L main, severe LAD c diffuse mid and proximal disease but filling distally from LIMA, diffuse moderate LCX c proximal OM occlusion.
MRI/MRA [**4-21**] showing mild-moderate stenosis of celiac artery.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed, with global hypokinesis (probably slightly worse in the inferolateral wall).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-5-19**], the overall left ventricular systolic function has deteriorated slightly.
Underwent angiography & stenting of Right Renal Artery & celiac artery [**2131-7-4**].
Lower extremity non-invasives were performed here & were negative for DVT.
Enzymes CK: 312-->255  MB: 11-->14  MB: 3.5-->5.4 Trop-*T*: 0.05-->0.04.
#Pump: EF 35-40%, w/ slight decrease in LV systolic funx since last echo, BNP 1870, CXR showed CHF.
Following RRA stenting, pt was weaned off Nitro drip & BP normalized, though still on multiple anti-hypertensive medications.
The day prior to discharge the pt's SBP ranged from 110's to 130's on the following regimen: Toprol XL 200mg daily, HCTZ 25mg daily, amlodipine 10mg daily, Imdur 120mg daily, and hydralazine 25mg QID.
Upon angiography of the aorta, the viscera, and the renal arteries, the pt was found to have only uni-lateral RAS (90%) & celiac artery stenosis (70%).
Lung sounds course & (+) non-productive cough.
WBC on admission in the 20's; however, it was thought that the pt was likely intra-vascularly dry & hemoconcentrated (Hct was 49, as well).
WBC trended down to 11.
As his volume status improved, his HCT acutely dropped to 32.
Repeat HCTs were stable & on day of discharge pt's HCT rebounded to 40--no transfusions given.
-Please go to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9654**] office in [**Hospital1 1474**] on Tuesday, [**7-17**] at 10:30am for a blood pressure check.
