On [**5-21**] CTA showed increasing size of the duodenal hematoma and an area concerning for active extravasation at D1.
Abd/Pelvic CT demonstrated a small anterior abdominal hematoma and a R paracolic gutter hematoma.
Hct did not increase despite multiple transfusions (hct down to 23 from 31)  On [**5-25**], he was taken back to the OR by surgeons, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3742**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for an exlap evacuation hematoma, suture ligation bleeding varix behind the head of the pancreas, and then suture ligation of bleeding varix in the anterior abdominal wall.
A RUQ U/S was done on [**5-26**] to evaluate for portal vein thrombus.
