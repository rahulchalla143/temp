Admission Date:  [**2174-8-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-9-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4975**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 82 y/o M with h/o HTN, PVD, COPD, recently discovered SDH in [**4-19**], ESRD on HD, as well as CAD s/p kissing stents to LAD/LCx in [**5-19**], followed by ISR of LAD in [**11-19**] and recent repeat cath in [**6-21**] for refractory chest pain with taxus stents to 80% LAD (distal to prior stent and 70% proximal LCx), med-flighted from [**Hospital6 8283**] with recurrent chest pain.
He was again referred to the ED, where his vitals were HR 68, BP 84/60.
An EKG demonstrated AF with LVH and ST depressions with TWI in inferolateral leads, unchanged from prior EKG.
His hypotension was presumed secondary to intravascular volume depletion and plans were made for careful IVF (given history of intubation secondary to CHF), while holding BP meds for low blood pressure.
Cardiac enzymes were CK 22/25/22, top I =.04/.04/.03.
He was continued on [**Month/Year (2) **], Plavix, and received metoprolol 25 mg as tolerated by blood pressure while at OSH.
Of note, patient's INR today 2.2 and had been given coumadin for AF at [**Hospital3 4298**].
CT at MVH showed stability.
PMH: 1) PVD 2) AAA-5x5 cm ([**4-21**]) 3) PAF 4) CVA-longstanding history of head complaints including intermittent vision loss and headache with many CT/MRAs demonstrating chronic changes.
5) COPD 6) Depression 7) ESRD on HD 8) HTN 9) diastolic chf with 2 intubations for respiratory failure in setting of fluid overload 10) CAD: Since last cath, had outpatient persantine thallium stress test performed in [**Hospital1 1562**]--septal ischemia with good ejection fraction .

CT Head OSH: No change in subdural hematoma.
Echocardiogram [**4-21**]: Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal  anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal; RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
C.Cath [**6-21**] COMMENTS: 1 Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated two vessel CAD.
2 Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressure with RVEDP=16 mmHg and LVEDP=20 mmHg.
The cardiac output was preserved with CI=3.8 L/min/m2.
3 Interrogation of the aortic valve demonstrated minimal aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 17 mmHg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**]=2.1 cm2.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection or embolisation.
Chest pain- Not convincingly cardiac given EKG relatively unchanged from prior (possibly increased ST depression in lateral leads) and no increase in cardac enzymes despite numeraous episodes of CP over last few days.
Will continue heparin drip and give Vitamin K for INR reversal with plans for possible cath monday.
Will consder ablation only if unable to decrease HR with meds - continue heparin gtt with frequent neuro evals given subdural hemorrhage.
Hold integrillin -[**Month/Day (1) **], Plavix -metoprolol 25 mg PO BID as tolerated, restart ACE-I next if BP tolerates -echo tomorrow, possibly cath monday at dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5452**] discretion -gave one dose of vit K. - obtain CTA to r/o PE, dissection as source of chest pain - will need op GI appointment for EGD (r/o PUD).
Because patient appears total body fluid overloaded, unclear that due to hypovolemia.
Subdural hematoma-stable CT at OSH .

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.
COMPARISON STUDY: CT scan of [**2174-5-8**] interpreted by Drs.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the stomach .
Tissue biopsy [**8-31**]: DIAGNOSIS: Stomach, mucosal biopsy:  Mild chronic inactive gastritis.
HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Final [**2174-9-2**]):       POSITIVE BY EIA.
He was continued on a heparin drip and underwent cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated no flow limiting CAD.
CTA was also performed, which ruled out pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Non-cardiac causes for the patient's chest pain were explored and he underwent a EGD, which demonstrated hypertrophic gastritis.
Anticoagulation: The patient was restarted on coumadin after a CT of his brain was performed to rule out expansion of previously noted subdural hematoma.
His chest x-ray demonstrated some degree of atelectasis and volume overload.
