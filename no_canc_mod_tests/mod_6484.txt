She had a work-up which included a negative head CT and a normal electrocardiogram and electrolytes.
There, during a physical examination by the medical students, in which she was standing up after she had done head to toe walking, she had an episode of syncope and on her rhythm strips she had sinus bradycardia to the 40s with a junctional escape rhythm.
She subsequently had a repeat episode in the ensuing minutes, again, with sinus bradycardia and junctional escape and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further observation.
Blood pressure 115/60.
Pulse of 95.
Respiratory rate of 18, saturating 97% on room air.
Temperature of 97.
Cardiac exam revealed a normal S1, S2 with mild tachycardia.
Her neurological exam was notable for horizontal nystagmus.
LABORATORY EXAM:  White blood cell count of 3,000 with a normal differential, hematocrit of 41, platelets of 163,000.
Electrolyte panel:  Sodium 139, potassium 3.8, chloride 99, bicarbonate 25, BUN of 15, creatinine 0.8, glucose of 92.
Her blood glucose during her syncopal episode was 102.
Chest x-ray was clear of any new infiltrates.
Head CT was negative.
Electrocardiogram was sinus with normal axis, normal intervals and no acute ischemic changes.
She did have a urinalysis which had white cells on it.
FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  As per recommendations of the Electrophysiology Service, she should have an echocardiogram in the ensuing week or two to assess her structural cardiac function.
