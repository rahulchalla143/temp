Her WBC was 23.9.
CT revealed free intraperitoneal air and suspected extraluminal pelvic feces.

CT abd/pelvis [**2182-10-29**]: 1.
Gas dissecting into the soft tissues of the pelvic side walls and extending into the left groin and anterior abdominal wall which may be related to extension of intraperitoneal gas; however, necrotizing fasciitis cannot be excluded.
CT abd/pelvis [**2182-11-11**]: 1.
Interval development of three dominant discrete abdominal fluid collections, which are suspicious for abscesses.
CT abd/pelvis [**2182-11-17**]: 1.
There is no definite evidence of a leak although the rectal contrast does not flow proximal to the anastomosis inspite of rectal distention with contrast and repeat/delayed scanning.
CTA chest [**2182-11-19**]: 1.
CT abd/pelvis [**2182-11-19**]: 1.
Pelvic US [**2182-11-28**]: Markedly limited examination due to the patient's clinical status and mobility as described above.
While no frank uterine abnormalities were identified, the examination was not sufficient to evaluate the endometrium for the presence or absence of malignancy.
Probable faint chondrocalcinosis, which can be seen with CPPD arthritis.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was started on vanc/levo/Flagyl and taken to the OR for urgent exploratory laparotomy on [**10-29**].
Her WBC increased from 14.4 to 24.1.
A stool sample was positive for C.diff, and PO vanc was added on [**11-3**].
A Dobhoff was placed and her NGT was d/c'd on [**11-9**].
Her leukocytosis was persistent despite treatment for C.diff; a CT scan on [**11-11**] demonstrated 3 probable abscesses.
On [**11-13**], a swallow evaluation cleared her for thin liquids and ground solids with assistance, which she tolerated.
ASA was started on [**11-14**] for platelets >1000.
A repeat CT performed on [**11-17**] demonstrated interval improvement in the size of her abdominal fluid collections and no anastamotic leak.
Drain cultures grew rare Pseudomonas; antibiotics were held.
On [**11-19**], she became tachycardic (120-135), hypertensive (180s/100s), and hypoxic (O2 82% on RA, 94% on 2L), wiht low UOP (10-15cc/hr).
A CTA torso demonstrated a new very small RML PE, unlikely to account for her presentation, and portal venous gas.
Her WBC increased to 24.5; Zosyn was started for heavy Pseudomonas (from her drain cultures) and E.coli (urine culture).
Repeat CT abdomen later in the day demonstrated a marked decrease in the amount of portal venous gas.
On [**11-26**], a swallow evaluation cleared her for thin liquids and ground solids with assistance.
Calorie counts were as follows: [**11-30**] 242 calories + 0 g. protein, [**12-1**] 269+4, [**12-2**] 1044+30.
Calorie counts were repeated as follows: [**12-7**] <300+0, [**12-8**] 653+33, [**12-9**] 555+18.
A transvaginal ultrasound failed to visualize the endometrial stripe and adnexa.
A pelvic exam performed by Ob/Gyn did not include a bimanual and failed to visualize the cervix.
Ob/Gyn recommended outpatient endometrial biopsy upon [**Month/Year (2) **] to rule out endometrial cancer.
An ultrasound demonstrated DVT of the L basilic, brachial, and axillary veins.
Lovenox was d/c'd on [**11-5**] when INR became therapeutic (>1.5).
A repeat ultrasound on [**12-9**] demonstrated recanalization of her brachial & axillary veins, with chronic occlusion of her basilic vein.
SQH was restarted when her INR was 2.0.
