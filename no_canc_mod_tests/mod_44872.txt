CT HEAD [**2111-5-17**] FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or large acute territorial infarction.
CT C/A/P [**2111-5-18**]: 1.
Celiac axis, SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] appear patent.
EKG [**2111-5-19**]: Atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction 117bpm no Q wave in aVF ST-T wave changes.

# Atrial flutter: Patient admitted with tachycardia to 130's EKG showed atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction vs AVNRT.
Carotid massage was performed without effect on tachycardia, she was treated with IV metoprolol and diltiazem which did not affect rate however did lower blood pressure from 140's to 100's systolic.
She was treated with adenosine and conduction rate slowed and clear atrial flutter waves were seen.
Tachycardia resumed and EKG showed atrial fibrillation/flutter.
ECHO showed LVEF >55% and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
She was complaining of lower abdominal pain and CT abdomen is consistent with enteritis.
Comibination of leukocytosis, fever, labiale blood pressure suggested septic physiology.
She was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole and stool studies sent and were unremarkable.
She received 2LNS in the ED and pressures were 120's to 140's on arrival to the ICU.
Her blood pressure was labile in the setting of tachyarrythmia and improved with improved rate control.
Her mental status improved 2 days prior to discharge and further antipsyhcotics were not requried.
Hematocrit was stable.e Iron studies are within normal limits, hemolysis labs are negative.
Head CT in the ED was negative for acute process.
Metoprolol to try to control your heart rate 3.
You should also have follow-up evaluation of an incidental pulmonary nodule in [**7-19**] months.
