ADMISSION LABS:  White count of 6.9, hematocrit of 25.4.
BUN and creatinine of 40/0.8.
Gram stain of the wound demonstrated gram positive cocci in pairs, chains and clusters.
The cultures obtained from the sternal swab in the Emergency Room had demonstrated coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, probable Enterococcus and Proteus.
The plastic surgeons recommended flap closure of the wound and the patient was taken to the Operating Room once again on [**8-29**] where an omental flap closure of his sternal wound was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], assisted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

The patient's urine sediment was examined and did not demonstrate any evidence ATN.
Given the fact that her sternotomy was healing very well with no erythema, edema, induration or drainage and the abdominal incision that was used for a flap was well healed with any erythema, edema, induration or drainage and that the patient had a PICC line placed and was capable of having intravenous antibiotics at a rehabilitation facility, it was felt that she was stable for transfer.
