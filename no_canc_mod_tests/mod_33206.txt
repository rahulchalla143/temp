She was then sent to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4117**] where a head CT, which per report, demonstrated the old infarct unchanged since an imaging study in [**2160-5-6**].
The UA was negative and CBC (WBC 10.1) was not suggestive of an infection.
INR was 2.9.
She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient continued to seize intermittently w/o regaining alertness; her heart rate was in the 140s-150s but was also noted to have a fever of 102.4.
Because of INR 2.9, ER staff deferred LP and started her on Vanco/CTX/Acyclovir.
Phenytoin level was 15.5.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.

Cxr 07/ 31/ 08: The lungs are clear.
CT CNS w/o Contrast: 07/ 30/ 08: There is left frontal encephalomalacia with ex vacuo dilatation of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle consistent with prior infarct.
EEG: 07/ 31/ 08: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captures no clinical or electrographic seizures.
Echocardiogram: 07/ 31/ 08: The left atrium is elongated.
MRI CNS w and w/o contrast: 08/ 01/ 08: Comparison is made with CT head [**2160-9-3**].
The bilateral PCA territories appear to be relatively preserved although there is involvement of the left superior PCA territory.
CT brain showed her chronic left MCA infarct and an acute infarct in the right MCA territory.
When she was in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was not a candidate for IV TPA, IA TPA, or mechanical intervention to treat the stroke for two reasons: the time of onset of her infarct was not known and she was anti-coagulated on coumadin with an INR of 2.9.
Carotid ultrasound on [**2160-9-4**] showed complete occlusion of the left ICA.
MRI brain on [**9-5**] showed massive infarcts of both anterior hemispheres and also part of the left PCA territory.
MRA brain showed occlusion of the right supraclinoid.
