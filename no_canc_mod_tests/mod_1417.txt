She noticed her blood glucose was very high and not responding to insulin for the past 24 hours.
Her EKG at 4:50pm showed large STE in V4-V6 with smaller STE in V2-3, I, and aVL.
Cath revealed an ulcerated plaque in the prox-mid LAD with distal emboli.
Hemodynamics revealed normal R and L filling pressures and a CI of 3.2.
EKG postcath had persistent large STE in V4-5, smaller STE in V6, I, II, and aVL.
Vitals were stable and EKG showed further improvement in her STEs.
Past Medical History: - DM, type I: dx 9y ago, on insulin pump, no known complications, states HgA1C has been 8.4 x 1y, followed at [**Last Name (un) **] - HTN: reports SPBs in high 130s, on quinapril - Major depressive disorder: on bupropion and Trileptal - Cervical disc herniation: C5-6, moderate spinal stenosis, stable - vitamin B12 deficiency: monthly injections  Social History: married,  2 children, works at [**Company 2267**], exercises daily, denies tobacco and drugs  Family History: no heart disease or DM  Physical Exam: vitals- T 97.0, HR 80, BP 154/83, RR 14, O2sat 100% 2LNC General- young woman lying flat in bed, NAD, flat affect HEENT- sclerae anicteric, moist MM, OP clear Neck- no JVD, no carotid bruits Lungs- CTAB anteriorly Heart- RRR, 2/6 SEM heard throughout Abd- soft, NT, ND, NABS Ext- no LE edema, DP/PT pulses 2+ b/l  Pertinent Results: OSH ECG: NSR at 86, 6-8 mm STE in V4-6, 1 mm STE in V2-3/I/L/II, TWI V1 ECG p cath: NSR at 76, 4 mm STE in V5-6, <1mm STE I/L/II, TWI V1 ECG in CCU: NSR at 85, persistent 1 mm STEs V4-6.
ECG at discharge: persistent 1 mm STEs V4-6.
Echo ([**2173-2-23**]): LA is normal in size.
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting normal LV filling pressure.
Echo ([**2173-2-25**]): unchanged compared with prior study [**2173-2-23**] except focal dyskinesis involving the very distal apex is now present.
Peak CK 1063; peak tropT 2.24.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 39F with diabetes mellitus type 1 x 9 years and mild HTN who presented to [**Hospital3 628**] with nausea, vomiting, and chest discomfort, found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis and to have large lateral ST elevations on ECG.
STEMI with peak CK 1063. .
Risk factors include suboptimally managed DM1 x 9 years (HbA1c in mid-8% range), mild HTN, mild hyperlipidemia with (LDL 108, TG ~90, HDL ~70 in [**10-26**]).
Peak CK 1063.
Echo on [**2173-2-23**] revealed preserved ejection fraction and no anterior wall dyskinesis.
Repeat echo on [**2173-2-25**] revealed small area of dyskinesis at distal apex, which likely accounts for patient's persistent ST changes.
Basic infectious work-up was normal, including chest x-ray and urinalysis.
