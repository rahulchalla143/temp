The patient reportedly had shortness of breath or chest pain on the day of admission and was found to be hypoxic on arrival to the Emergency Room with O2 saturations of 79% on room air increasing to 88% on 6 liters increasing to 94% on a nonrebreather.
Patient's oxygen saturations improved on 2 liters nasal cannula with more than 600 cc in the Foley bag.
CHF with echocardiogram on [**11-27**] showing an EF of less than 25%, mild-to-moderate MR. 2.
Calcium with vitamin D. 2.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature was 101.5, 103.3, blood pressure was 158/72, ranging 135/60-198/91, heart rate was 88, ranging 97-114, respiratory rate was 28, and O2 saturation was 97% on 2 liters.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with crackles at the bases bilaterally and decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
PERTINENT ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  Creatinine was stable at 0.9.
Hematocrit was stable at 36.2.
TSH was 3.5.
Her chest x-ray showed signs of CHF.
EKG showed a right bundle branch block at 113, ST elevations in V3 through V6.
Cardiovascular/coronaries:  Patient has two-vessel CAD based on her catheterization in [**2143**].
The [**2143**] catheterization showed LAD with 80% stenosis prior to D2, 90% stenosis after D2, RCA with 40% stenosis in the mid section and 40% stenosis after the PDA takeoff.
Pump:  The patient's ejection fraction is less than 25% based on an echocardiogram on [**11-27**] with trace AR and MR.
Patient was started on a nitroglycerin drip in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for good blood pressure control and was changed to Imdur as her nitroglycerin drip was weaned off.
Her ABG at that point in time was 7.31, 46, and 48 with a chest x-ray revealing worsening CHF.
Once her blood pressure was controlled, she no longer had episodes of flash pulmonary edema.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 25%.
