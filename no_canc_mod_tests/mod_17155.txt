Admission Date:  [**2117-7-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-7-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-11-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: CP, NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catherization  History of Present Illness: 80 year old woman with a history of CAD s/p CABG([**Doctor Last Name **]) on [**2117-5-20**] with a LIMA to LAD, SVG Y graft to OM & Diag in addition to AFib and HTN who originally presented to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with chest pain and dyspnea where she was found to have a NSTEMI with peak TropI of 17.
ECG obtained was without acute ischemic ST changes.
Remaining hospital course unclear as not documented in records but she was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catherization.
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2117-4-13**] anatomy as follows: 1.
Physical Exam: VS: T Afeb, BP 139/66, HR 69, RR 18, O2 95% on 2LNC Gen: Well in NAD, resp or otherwise.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP 1+ PT [**Name (NI) 2325**]: Carotid 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP 1+PT   Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated: NSR ar 65 with RADand prolonged PR.
no ST changes (per-cath)  CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2117-7-26**] demonstrated: -mild disease LMCA -dital LAD TO -95% LCx -patent stent in RCA -SVG:OM1-DM1 occluded -patent LIMA-LAD.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-4-14**], a large circumferential pericardial effusion is now present with echocardiographic signs of tamponade physiology.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2117-7-27**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Pending):  [**7-28**] TTE: Conclusions:  Suboptimal image quality.The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-7-27**], no change.
Upon presentation she was presumed to have an NSTEMI with peak cardiac enzymes CK = 691 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
Balloon angioplasty of OM2 lesion on [**7-26**] was well tolerated, with results as above.
follow-up echo's on [**7-27**] and [**7-28**] showed resolution of the pericardial effusions.
It was also suspected that the elevation of cardiac enzymes could also be related to this post-pericardiotomy syndrome.
Culture showed a preliminary finding of GNR > 100,000 presumed to be E. coli.
Medications on Admission: coumadin 2.5mg enalapril 20mg colace 200mg amiodarone 200mg Iron 325mg plavix 75mg asa 81mg lopressor 50mg [**Hospital1 **] lipitor 80 omeprazole   Discharge Medications: 1.
On a routine echocardiogram you were found to have fluid around your heart which was drained.
Please make an appointment to have an echocardiogram next week.
