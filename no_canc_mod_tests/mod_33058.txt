In the ED, CTA and CXR were negative.
WBC= 5.9 with 38% bandemia.
Initially HR= 150 with sbp 70-80 with rate related ST-segment depressions, initial set of cardiac enzymes negative.
After 3 liters of IVF, patient remained hypotensive to 70s systolic and HR remained 120-140s.
Stat echo was done showing normal valves and function.

[**2150-2-28**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: This study is somewhat limited by motion artifact.
Small fluid levels in the left maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
[**2150-2-28**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases demonstrate pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left.
Evaluation of the large and small bowel is limited without oral contrast.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A small amount of low-density fluid layers into the pelvis.
[**2150-2-27**] CTA CHEST W/ AND W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.
This examination is not tailored for detailed evaluation of subdiaphragmatic regions.
Recommend correlation with physical exam and [**Name (NI) 13416**], when feasible (given the patient's clinical presentation, is there any possibility of underlying thyroid, or adrenal, disease?).
FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of this date, there is little overall change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications that only spare the left lower lung.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a 54 y/o female admitted for hypotension to SBP 70-80s.
During her hospital stay patient has a persistent tachycardia that did not respond to fluids, antibiotics, analgesics, beta-blockers, or anxiolytics.
She was maintained on ARDS protocol of a TV of 7cc/kg.
On [**3-10**], given patients worsening ARDS, and recent extubation it was felt that her lung function might improve if she was started on prone ventilation.
Immediately following her transfer to the prone bed, pt developed hypotension to the SBP of 50s while receiving maximum levophed and neosynephrine.
CPR was started, many rounds of epi and atropine were given.
