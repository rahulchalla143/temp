Labs were notable for creatinine of 3.8 (from baseline of 0.8), hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia.
CXR was reportedly clear with possible linear atelectasis.
ECG was significant for QTc prolongation to 514.
She had a renal ultrasound that showed no hydronephrosis and nephrostomy tubes in place.
LENIs were negative for DVT.
Her HR dropped to the 40's initially but improved to 60-70.
- [**2141-1-26**]: colonoscopy revealed a polyp in her sigmoid colon and a 2.5 cm distal rectal mass arising from the anal verge in the posterior rectum with a large area of induration.
- [**2141-1-31**]: CT torso revealed an exophytic rectal mass measuring 4.8 x 3.8 cm, bulging posteriorly into the presacral space and anteriorly towards the uterus.
Rectal ultrasound on [**2141-1-31**] and rectal MRI on [**2141-2-7**] were compatible with T3 disease.
- [**2141-2-20**]: began chemoradiation - [**2141-3-10**]: 5-FU was discontinued due to mucositis, neutropenia, and abdominal cramping - [**2141-3-13**]: 5-FU was restarted at a reduced dose - [**2141-3-22**]: 5-FU was again stopped due to mucositis, perirectal skin changes, diarrhea, and electrolyte abnormalities.
- [**Date range (3) 70844**]: Radiation was also held - [**2141-3-27**]: 5-FU was restarted at a further reduced dose - [**2141-3-31**]: completed radiation - [**2141-4-3**]: completed chemotherapy - [**Date range (3) 70845**]: hospitalized for bowel rest and the initiation of TPN due to presumed radiation enteritis.
- [**2141-5-31**]: found to be HIV positive and began on HAART - [**Date range (1) 70846**]: required hospitalization for an SBO, underwent laparotomy, ileocecectomy, end-ileostomy, and placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube on [**2141-6-16**].
- [**7-/2141**]: Once her CD4 count had recovered, she underwent laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, ileal resection, proctosigmoidectomy, colonic jejunal pouch to near-anal anastomosis with EEA, takedown splenic flexure, resection of ileostomy and creation of new end-ileostomy.
Pathology from the surgical specimen revealed no residual carcinoma and all 14 lymph nodes sampled were free of disease.
- [**9-/2141**], [**10/2141**]: Subsequent imaging of the abdomen & pelvis showed no evidence of recurrence.
- [**2142-2-14**]: CT abdomen showed "hyperdense thickening in the lumen near the anastomatic site, new since the earlier study.
Local recurrence cannot be excluded, although possibly the appearance is associated with endoluminal debris."

[**4-4**] CT Abd/Pelvis 1.
No CT evidence for cystitis; however, evaluation is limited both by underdistension of the bladder as well as significant likely radiation-related changes in the lower pelvis.
On review of chart and discussion w PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was found that patient baseline pressures were SBP 80s.
Patient was found to have a Klebsiella UTI based on cultures from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**].
Vomiting: Patient reported vomitting prior to admission, which had resolved by the time of admission w subsequent increase in her ostomy output to baseline.
Acute renal failure: Creatinine was elevated to 3.8 on admission from baseline of 0.8.
Urine lytes were c/w prerenal state, and Cr trended down w fluid resuscitation.
Rectal cancer: No evidence of recurrence by CT [**11/2142**] or CEA [**2143-2-12**].
Pending - At discharge, admission blood cultures remained pending.
You were briefly given IV medications to increase your blood pressure, and antibiotics to treat a urinary tract infection.
