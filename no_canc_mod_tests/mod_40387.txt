NIHSS at OSH was reported as 20 (right-sided weakness and aphasia) and he was given IV tPA (7.7 mg bolus and then 67.3 mg over 1 hour).
CT scan at the OSH was notable for a hyperdense left MCA.
A code stroke was called and the patient was taken to CT and then neuro-interventional suite.

NONCONTRAST HEAD CT ([**2156-2-21**]) 1.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT ([**2156-2-23**]) Progressive evolution of left MCA territory infarction with local mass effect on sulci in the left lateral ventricle without midline shift.
On presentation to the ED, exam c/w global aphasia and right hemiplegia.
First, his neuro exam had improved substantially.
He was continued then on coumadin with goal INR [**3-11**].
On hospital day 2, the patient had diminished movement on the right side compared to his exam on arrival.
Head CT showed local mass effect from edema in the L MCA territory, which likely caused his clinical decline.
He was monitored carefully in the stepdown unit, and his exam continued to fluctuate, though it overall improved.
There was some concern that he had not completed the stroke, and repeat CT scans were done to evaluate for interval worsening.
TTE showed small stretched PFO or ASD, most likely not related to his current stroke.
