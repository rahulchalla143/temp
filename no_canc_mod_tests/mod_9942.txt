He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for evaluation and further care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission his temperature was afebrile, blood pressure 132/82, pulse 59, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination showed anicteric sclerae, dry blood around mouth, no oral lesions, moist mucous membranes.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Jugular venous pressure was difficult to assess.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission he had a CK of 382, MB of 57, MB index of 14.9, troponin 3.25.
EKG showed sinus bradycardia with normal axis, inferior ST elevations and anterior ST depressions; no resolution of ST depressions or ST elevations post thrombolysis.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 74-year-old male with inferior posterior ST elevation myocardial infarction status post thrombolysis admitted to the coronary care unit for monitoring and cardiac catheterization.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular:  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2118-11-15**] which showed right-sided pressures, right atrium 7, right ventricle 26/7, pulmonary artery pressure 26/11, pulmonary wedge of 8, left ventricular systolic pressure 112, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 8.
Cardiac output was 3.7, cardiac index 2.2, SVR 1535.
Coronary catheterization showed distal right coronary artery 80% discrete stenosis otherwise normal cardiac catheterization.
He underwent echocardiogram on [**2118-11-16**] which showed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities including basal inferoseptal akinesis, mid inferoseptal akinesis, basal inferior akinesis, mid inferior akinesis, basal inferolateral akinesis, mid inferolateral akinesis, inferior apex hypokinetic, lateral apex hypokinetic.
Ejection fraction was estimated to be 40-45%.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] at [**Hospital3 31084**] for further cardiac care.
