Per EMS, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was unresponsive, sugar 500, BP 90/50, HR 110, regular and RR 24, Sat 100% on NRB.
She was intubated for airway protection (ABG 7.02/23/69), sugar >1000, SBP 100/83, HR 87.
Post-intubation, her BP dropped to 72/33.
Her DM is complicated by peripheral neuropathy, proliferative retinopathy (left eye blindness), and nephropathy.
Nuclear stress test [**4-21**]: P-MIBI, without fixed or reversible defects, normal wall motion.
EF 61%.
Physical Exam: Physical examination per admission note: VITALS: T 97.3, BP 75/33 --> 118/60.
HR 80-100.
Physical examination on transfer to floor: VITALS: Tm 99.1, HR 70-90, BP 100-149/60/100 off Levophed, RR 20s, Sat 98-100% on room air.

[**2171-7-1**] CT HEAD: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, minor or major vascular territorial infarct.
/nkg  ******** Micro: Blood cultures X 4 NGTD Urine cultures X 2 negative  Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo female with long-standing DM type 1 with triopathy, admitted with DKA of unclear precipitant and profound metabolic dissaray.
1) DKA: As noted above, her initial gap on admission was 44 with profound metabolic dissaray.
She was started on a regular insulin drip (required as much as 20 units per hour), and aggressively hydrated with close monitoring of her electrolytes, with eventual closure of the gap.
She has little recollection of the events that pre-dated her admission, but remembers feeling slightly unwell 3 days PTA with some dizziness.
She did have an elevated WBC on admission without left shift, and an infectious work-up was negative, including U/A, urine culture, blood cultures, and CXR.
A CT head was negative.
2) Hypotension: As noted above, her blood pressure dropped in the ED following intubation, and she was started on Levophed for hemodynamic support.
Her hypotension was most likely [**2-20**] hypovolemia, exacerbated by sedative medications peri-intubation.
3) CAD: EKG on admission showed lateral ST depressions in the setting of tachycardia.
Cardiac enzymes also revealed a mild troponin leak with peak troponin 0.19 but flat MB, in the setting of acute renal failure and tachycardia.
Review of her records indicated that she had a P-MIBI in [**2169**] without reversible defects, normal EF.
A repeat EKG on hospital day #2 showed resolution of the changes.
ABG was initially concerning for an A-a gradient, and a V/Q scan was obtained and returned as low probability for PE.
Her creatinine peaked at 4.5 on admission, and came down with hydration.
Urine lytes were sent on [**7-3**], and were suggestive of superimposed ATN with FeNa 5.2%.
Her creatinine continued to improve with hydration, down to baseline at the time of discharge.
6) Anemia: Her hematocrit dropped to 28 while in the MICU, felt [**2-20**] aggressive fluid rescuscitation.
Review of her records indicated a baseline hematocrit in the high 20s.
Her hematocrit subsequently remained stable, and further work-up was deferred.
Her abdominal examination was benign throughout, and amylase trended down with hydration.
9) ID: As noted above, an initial infectious work-up was unremarkable.
A repeat infectious work-up was performed, with negative CXR, U/A with few WBC but + epithelial cells (foley removed), and cultures all negative to date.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your PCP or return to the ED if your blood sugars are greater than 400 or less than 50.
