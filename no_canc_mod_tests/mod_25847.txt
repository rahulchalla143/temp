He was also acidotic with a pH of 7.25 despite a PCO2 of 42, so he recieved several fluid boluses for post operative hypovolemia (and oliguria).
His WBC was 14.
His WBC was 12.
His pH was 7.31.
All of his surveillance cultures were negative.
On POD 3, his abdomen was still slightly distended but not tender.
He needed electrolyte repletion for a K+ of 3.1 and an Mg of 1.7.
He had a lot of diarrhea and a rectal bag was placed.
He became tachycardic to 125 and hypertensive to an SBP of 178.
He was pan-cultured (all cultures negative) and he was ruled out for an MI.
A chest X-ray showed bilobar opacities.
His WBC was 18.9.
A repeat CXR showed a left lower lobe opacity and small bilateral effusions.
A CT of the abdomen was obtained to rule out an intra-abdominal source of infection and it showed a partial small bowel obstruction, and a large amount of intraabdominal free air and free fluid, with high-attenuation material within the free fluid consistent either with blood or contrast leak.
That night, his HR was 138, his BP was 194/98, and his O2 sat was 89%.
An ABG was drawn- 7.46/30/80.
His WBC was 22.
On POD 1, he was febrile to 103.
His WBC was 31.
His oxygen saturations were maintained with a face tent.
He spiked a fever to 101.5 and his WBC was 12.
On POD 10,5 he spiked to 101.2 and his WBC was 14.
On POD 11,6 he passed a bedside swallow evaluation for a soft diet.
On POD 12,7 he was maintained on just Linezolid and Gentamycin for coverage of his Acinetobacter (peritoneal fluid, cath tip) and Enterococcus (peritoneal, blood).
That night, his central line was removed due to erythema and the tip was sent for culture (which subsequently grew Acinetobacter), so he was maintained on only perhiperal IVs.
On POD 14,9 he was transferred to the floor.
His Haldol was only PRN at this point.
