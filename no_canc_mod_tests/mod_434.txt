[**2164-3-19**]   CHEST (PA & LAT): Limited exam with subtle opacities in the lower lungs which may represent atelectasis versus early pneumonia.
Given technical limitations, consider a repeat study with more optimized technique to more thoroughly assess.
[**2164-3-19**]   CT BRAIN PERFUSION: 1.
Neurologic: Neurologic examination showed left visual field cut, left facial droop and right UE ataxia; exam remained stable throughout admission.
CTA revealed proximal and distal right cervical internal carotid artery 4 mm in diameter.
BP goal was 110-170/90, achieved with home meds; lisinopril briefly held during admission due to renal insufficiency.
Stroke risk factors checked, LDL 118, HBA1C 5.9.
Pt's hematocrit remained stable without further episodes of hematemesis during admission.
Cardiovascular: Initial EKG in ED revealed pre-mature atrial contractions.
Repeat EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, no episodes of arrhythmia noted throughout admission.
Goal SBP < 160 achieved with adjustment of home antihypertensives (nifedipine CR 180mg qd, atenolol 50 qd); lisinopril 40 qd held briefly due to elevated Cr.
LDL 118, increased home simvastatin from 10 to 40mg daily.
Pt will need close monitoring of renal function as he has had elevated creatinine; urine lytes during admission revealed pre-renal azotemia (FeNa 0.3%).
CXR with questionable aspiration pneumonia vs atelectasis.
WBC wnl at time of discharge.
Endocrine: A1c 5.9.
This may have been caused by a blood clot from your heart.
Your LDL cholesterol was 118.
You had a cardiac echocardiogram which demonstrated no clear cardioembolic source.
You were checked for blood glucose control with a HgB A1c.
The following changes were made to your medications: -INCREASE simvastatin to 40mg by mouth daily to lower cholesterol -INCREASE nifedipine to 180mg by mouth daily to lower your blood pressure -START hydrochlorathiazide 12.5mg  by mouth twice daily to lower your blood pressure -START Lovenox injections twice a day to prevent blood clot; stop once INR [**12-22**] -START Coumadin 5mg by mouth daily to prevent blood clot; dosage may be changed for goal INR [**12-22**].
