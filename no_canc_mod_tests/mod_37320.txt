Pertinent Results: Hematocrit: 27.5 - 35.1  Electrolytes ([**8-17**]): Na 148, K 3.5, HCO3 29, Cl 107, UreaN 17, Creat 0.7, Glucose 98, Ca 8.8, Phos 2.8, Mg 2.4  Liver Function ([**8-16**]): ALT 206, AST 116, Alk Phos 46, Amylase 103, Lipase 21, TBili 0.4, Dbili 0.1, Ibili 0.3  Radiology: [**8-14**] Portable Chest X-Ray - 1.
[**8-14**] Portable Chest X-Ray - increasing pulmonary vascular congestion  [**8-15**] Portable Chest X-Ray - There is now dense confluent opacity involving much of both hemithoraces, with overall appearance suggestive of combination of pulmonary edema and posteriorly-layering pleural effusions; the heart size and pulmonary vessels are, therefore, difficult to evaluate, and a contribution of pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded.
[**8-15**] Portable Chest X-Ray - Severe bibasilar atelectasis persists following decrease in previously large bilateral pleural effusion and pulmonary edema.
[**8-16**] Portable Chest X-Ray - The lung volumes remain very low with  unchanged left retrocardiac opacity most likely representing atelectasis.
[**8-18**] Portable Chest X-Ray - Lung volumes remain low minimally increased from the recent study.
[**8-15**] - Upper GI Study - Patient swallowed barium without difficulty.
Pathology - Hernia Sac: 1.
Portable chest x-rays were obtained throughout post-operative day #1 and #2 with low [**Last Name (un) 101518**] volumes, initial worsening and then improvement in pulmonary congestion.
An upper GI study on post-operative day #2 demonstrated no leakage.
When provided with a walker, the patient's oxygen saturation was 94-96% on room air, including on stairs.
She had a formal PT evaluation on the day of discharge and went home with a walker and a commode with a plan for PT to see her at home.
