Vitamin E.   SU[**Last Name (STitle) 42242**]OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Post cardiac catheterization on [**2110-9-16**], the patient was referred for a mitral valve replacement.
Postoperatively, mean arterial pressure was 70, CVP of 11.
On the same day, he was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26.9.
On [**9-27**], postoperative day five, the patient experienced several episodes of atrial fibrillation with a repeat EP consult, which recommended beta blockers for rate control and again Coumadin therapy for at least six weeks.
Following atenolol doses on postoperative day six, heart rate dropped to the 30s and 40s with no symptoms and blood pressures stable 110s/50s, and atenolol was D/C'd.
The patient continued even after the atenolol was D/C'd to be in a junctional rhythm with episodes of his heart rate dropping to the 30s and 40s again asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable with blood pressure 100-120s/50s-60s.
The patient was followed by Physical Therapy throughout his hospital stay for evaluation and treatment.
Heart rate 68 in sinus rhythm and sinus bradycardia, blood pressure 124/68 and 97 percent on room air.
Laboratories:  Sodium 137, potassium 4.3, chloride 102, bicarb 26, BUN 31, creatinine 1.5.
White count 8.7, hematocrit 31.6, platelets 240.
PT 18.6, INR 2.2.
