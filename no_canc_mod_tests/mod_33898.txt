Initial vitals at OSH: 97 105 130/80 20 (no 02 sat given).
Exam notable for PERRLA, supple neck, normal cardiopulmonary exam , RLE ulcerations, not oriented with intact cranial nerves.
Labs notable for WBC 6.7, Hb 9.2, Na 147, BUN 25, Cr 0.9, UA with 15-20 WBCs, negative nitrites, leuk esterase, +ketones.
Non-Contrast Head CT unrevealing.
On [**2108-12-22**] the pt was noted to have 1 episode of hemoptysis and subsequently underwent a non-contrast chest CT that was unrevealing for any infiltrates or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
OSH evaluation by Cardiology on [**2108-12-22**] for sinus tachycardia (rate 160-180s) and mild troponin bump (0.4, 0.5), recommended patient be transfused for Hct of 30.
BP remained stable.
Troponins at OSH were noted to be 0.4 ([**2108-12-21**]) -> 0.5 ([**2108-12-22**]).
CVP 6-10, noted to be +2.3L (2600:I, 300:O).
ABG 7.41/23/73.
OSH evaluation by Pulmonology on [**2108-12-23**] for hypoxia and question signs of pneumonitis, however at the time the pulmonary team felt the pt to be in decompensated systolic CHF (given CXR finding of pulmomary edema), and recommended diuresis.
OSH team felt believed some of her symptoms may have been secondary to narcotic and/or benzo withdrwal (as evidence by flushing and diaphoresis) and thus, she was also receiving Morphine IV and Valium q6H.
Given a concern of sepsis in a patient with MS changes and tachycardia the pt was given Vancomycin 1gm IVx1 and Zosyn 3.375mg IVx1 on [**2108-12-23**] (nursing report listed Cefepime 2gm IV however no record seen in med rec).
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Cryocrit of 23% - Treated with cyclophosphamide [**2101**] (per report) - [**Date range (3) 84207**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] for evaluation of ischemic toes.
She used to smoke [**12-15**] ppd but quit one month ago, prior to that was [**12-15**] ppd for 25years.

CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a tachycardia with an average rate of 121 bpm.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infections are common causes.
Note is made of periods of electrode artifact obscuring the record and a tachycardia with an average rate of 121 bpm.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-12-24**], the degree of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.
A lumbar puncture was performed which did not show evidence of bacterial meningitis.
CSF studies for enterovirus, [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus, HSV PCR, oligoclonal bands were negative.
CSF beta2-microglobulin and LCM serology was pending.
Rheum workup included positive [**Doctor First Name **], negative dsDNA and anti-Sm, positive anti-Ro and La, normal C3, decreased C4, increased beta2-microglobin in serum, and positive cryoglobulins.
Pt received 20 IV solumedrol q8h per rheum recs.
Benzo withdrawal was considered likely, since patient had not been able to take PO meds for several days prior to admission, and this could explain delirium.
Differential includes airway (Asthma, COPD, although no history of either per prior records), Alveolar (PNA, CHF, pt with clear CXR on [**12-21**] followed by evidence of pulmonary edema following fluid resuscitation at OSH), Vascular (PE).
CXR appeared unchanged.
# Coagulopathy: Pt preesnting with INR of 3.9 without signs of bleeding.
INR noted to be 4.1 on [**12-22**] at OSH.
# Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Patient appears to be clinically on exam with evidence of JVP, lungs, lower extremities.
Initial echo showed BiV hypokinesis, EF 20%, moderate MR, trivial pericardial effusion.
Repeat echo after first PEA arrest showed worsened TR with otherwise similar LVEF.
# SLE: Patient on stable long term management with CellCept, Prednisone, which were continued.
