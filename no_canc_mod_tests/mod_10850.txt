He arrived to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department at 9:10 p.m. with a blood pressure of 62/32.
An electrocardiogram was done at that time which showed ST anterior leads and a third degree heart block.
Cardiac catheterization showed no significant disease of the left main, mild diffuse disease of the left anterior descending, right coronary artery was a small vessel without disease, and total occlusion of proximal dominant CX.
Hemodynamics Swan showed  pulmonary artery pressures of 45/22, wedge pressure of 22 and right atrial pressure of 7.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to CCU, temperature was 93.3, blood pressure 108/64, heart rate 84, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 96% on FIO2 of 100%.
His chest was clear to auscultation anteriorly, but the patient was lying flat due to femoral catheter.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate, soft S1 and normal S2.
On abdominal examination, it was nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds were present.
He had 0-1+ posterior tibialis and dorsalis pedis pulses on the left and 1+ to 2+ posterior tibialis and dorsalis pedis pulses on the right.
LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white blood cell count was 22.4, hemoglobin 10.3, hematocrit 31.1, platelets 334,000.
Prothrombin time 14.3, partial thromboplastin time 33.8, INR 1.4.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.0, chloride 107, bicarbonate 17, blood urea nitrogen 23, creatinine 0.9, glucose 299.
CK peaked at 4609 on admission, CK MB 624 with an index of 13.5 also peaked on admission.
Triglycerides 61, HDL 53, LDL 71.
Electrocardiogram performed at outside hospital [**2174-8-16**], at 9:00 p.m. showed 2:1 AV block, 2.
[**Street Address(2) 2811**] depressions in V1 through V3.
Repeat electrocardiogram at outside hospital [**2174-8-16**], at 2230 showed first degree AV delay, 3.0 to 4.
Transthoracic echocardiogram performed [**2174-8-17**], showed an ejection fraction of 35 to 40% with moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferolateral akinesis and basal inferior akinesis, mild inferior hypokinesis, mild aortic stenosis, 1+ mitral regurgitation.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and showed a peak on his admission laboratories of CK 4609, MB fraction 624 and an index of 13.5 with a troponin greater than 50.
Cardiac enzymes trended down through his hospital course.
He was initially started on Lipitor 10 mg but was discontinued when LDL came back at 71 with a total cholesterol of 136.
Systolic dysfunction - A transthoracic echocardiogram performed [**2174-8-17**], showed a depressed ejection fraction of 35 to 40%.
He also required diuresis and had net negative three liters from dry weight at the time of dictation.
Serial chest x-rays were performed while in the Intensive Care Unit which indicated congestive heart failure with a consolidation in the left lobe.
Due to chest x-ray and clinical findings, he was transiently switched to adult respiratory distress syndrome ventilation protocol with increased respiratory rate and decreased tidal volumes.
He was pancultured with a negative urine culture and sputum culture with one of four blood cultures positive for alpha Streptococcus thought to be a contaminant.
Hematology - The patient's hematocrit dropped as low as 26 throughout hospital stay and he was transfused a total of four units packed red blood cells at the time of dictation.
He has been stable with a hematocrit of 130 for a number of days after transfusion.
Insulin sliding scale was discontinued after hemoglobin A1C came back at 5.6 and blood sugar normalized around 100.
