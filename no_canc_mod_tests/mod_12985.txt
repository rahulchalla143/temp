At rehab, oxygen saturation was initially 78% on 3L and improved to 95-97% 4L and upright positioning.
Baseline oxygen saturation is high 80s.
CXR showed possible right lower lobe infiltrate and slight nonspecific interstitial prominence.
CXR showed mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
She was placed on BiPAP as she continued to be tachypneic in the 40s with oxygen saturation in low 90s on 4L.
.In the ICU: -PICC placed after 1U FFP for INR of 8 -cards was consulted for afib and critical AS: recommends increasing beta blocker to 25 TID (home dose) to keep HR <100.

Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):  .
CXR [**2130-2-28**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
TTE [**2130-2-25**]: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-11-25**], aortic stenosis severity has progressed.
[**2130-2-28**] RUE US: FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were acquired of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, basilic, brachial, and cephalic veins.
# Hypoxia: Pt had initial oxygen desaturation to 78% on 3L, now improved to 90s on NC after being on BiPAP for short duration in ICU.
First, pt has fever and leukocytosis (WBC 21) with CXR showing new right lower lobe opacity, strongly suggestive of pneumonia.
Other potential reasons for her hypoxia are COPD (no PFTs available) and CHF exacerbation (CXR showing pulmonary edema and BNP elevated to 8000s).
The pt is on coumadin at home; daily INR was followed and coumadin dose adjusted accordingly, particularly as pt has hx of supratherapeutic INR on levofloxacin (increased to peak of 8 in ICU).
After callout from the ICU, we continued PO metoprolol for rate control: she is currently on 25mg TID currently, controlled with HR in 90-100s.
Warfarin was restarted 2.5mg on 2/7pm; 3.5mg given on 2/8pm for INR of 1.8.
# Aortic stenosis: Most recent TTE on [**2129-11-25**] showed preserved EF (55%), but moderate/severe AS (valve area 1cm2), and MR/TR.
RUE duplex showed no e/o DVT; pt's RUE pain disappeared on its own (was likely musculoskeletal in nature), and she was maintained on APAP for pain prn.
Please check daily INR and adjust warfarin dose for goal 2.0-3.0 (pt is on levofloxacin which may increase INR).
Please check vancomycin trough on 2/8pm prior to giving vancomycin dose and adjust vancomycin dose accordingly.
Blood Cx from [**2130-2-24**] show NGTD and are still pending.
Pt has f/u visit with cardiology on [**3-10**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for eval of core-valve procedure candidacy.
