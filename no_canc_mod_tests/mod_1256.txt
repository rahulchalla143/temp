Here her SBP has been in the 150-160s, while at her care facility she had SBP in 90s.
In the ICU, isoproterenol was kept on hold in case of bradycardia, but the patient did not require any medical intervention for her heart rate.
# PUMP: Last TTE from [**10-16**] showed pt had EF of 60-65%.
# Hyperkalemia: K 5.4 in setting of intravascular depletion.
K was 4.4 on repeat.
# Anemia: Hct 32.1 up from mid twenties in [**Month (only) 359**].
