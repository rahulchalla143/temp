Her hct was noticed to be 18 on admission to [**Hospital1 1474**] and was transfused 1 unit, which brought her up to 26.6.
Also, she was noted to have an elevated troponin with a flat CK and negative MB fraction.
She initially was found to have BP of 91/45, but then stabilized to 120/70s throughtout her stay.

Diagnostic considerations include multiple bone islands.
Shoulder/huermus/wrist: Diffuse demineralization, which limits assessment for fracture, none is seen.
Type I anterior subluxation of C3 onto C4 with compression deformities of C4 through 7 and anterior wedging noted of C4 and C5.
CT head: Multiple hypodensities involving the subcortical white matter and cortex bilaterally, likely representing infarcts.
Correlation with history and neurologic exam is recommended.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
CT abd/pelvis: 1)  Right-sided dynamic hip screw for old right intratrochanteric fracture with recent placement of right intramedullary nail for right distal femoral fracture 2) Old left intratrochanteric fracture.
Additionally, the patient was noted to have L hip pain and a hip film appears to show a l hip fracture as well.
The cause for her hypotension was unclear; she was started on antibiotics empirically for sepsis; [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was equivocal so she was started on hydrocortisone.
Culture data only revealed a pan-sensitive pseudomonas UTI which was treated with 3d ciprofloxacin.
Because of her + cardiac enzymes an eccho was ordered which showed severe valvluar regurgiation (3+TR; 3+MR; 1+ AR) which likely contributed to her hypotension.
Due to concern of total body fluid overload ([**Location (un) **]-sarca) with hypotension, low urine output, and very low albumin the patient was given several days of IV albumin which temporarily improved her blood pressure and allowed diuresis.
# CHF: As above Ms [**Known lastname **] was noted to have severe valvular regurgitation on Eccho (3+MR; 3+ TR; 1+ AR; preserved LVEF).
# Arrhythmia: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with HR in the 100-120 range.
# NSTEMI: Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted with troponins + to a peak of 0.23 which trended down after admission.
Her EKG...Eccho did not reveal any wall motion abnormalities.
# UTI: Admission urine culture was + for pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
She was treated with cipro x 3 days; repeat urine culture was negative.
A wound culture was taken from the wound, and it was monitored for signs of infection.
Cr 1.4 now.
