The patient had not progressed to requiring dialysis; although, her glomerular filtration rate was 16 mL per minute as of [**2148-2-11**].
However, in the morning on postoperative day one her urine output was noted to decrease to about 10 cc per hour.
The patient's blood pressure was also noted to trend down to a systolic blood pressure of 100.
The patient was started on a Neo-Synephrine drip to try and keep her systolic blood pressure greater than 110 and later changed to greater than 120.
The patient's urine output was noted to increase with this as well as with intravenous boluses of fluid.
The cause for the patient's decreased urine output was not absolutely clear.
The patient had a transplant kidney ultrasound which revealed some slow flow through the lower pole of the kidney which was believed likely secondary to the patient's anatomy.
The patient's central venous pressure was only 4 at the time.
The patient's serum creatinine was also noted to increase to a high of 2.8 on postoperative day two; gradually trending down to a creatinine of 2.1 on the day of discharge.
By postoperative day five, the patient was less fluid overloaded and had responded well to her Lasix with a urine output of 5 liters on the day before and almost 1 liter on the first shift that day.
