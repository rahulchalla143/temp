He was taken to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, had his C-spine cleared for trauma, but was found to have an unstable burst fracture of L1, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
He also notes an episode at rehab where his blood pressure might have been slightly low on getting out of bed but he says this resolved rapidly on sitting back down.
He had an MRI at that time which revealed recurrent instability, so he was taken back to the OR for T12-L2 reconstruction of ankylosing spnodylitis type fracture with a lateral trans-diaphragmatic approach.
On [**12-28**] he was being positioned for a CXR and he heard a snap and noticed that the pain he had been having in his back since the operation disappeared.

Imaging: ======== MRI Thoracic and Lumbar spine [**2147-12-29**]: 1.
CT lumbosacral myelogram [**12-28**]: Per radiology report, evaluation is limited from T10-T12 level.
CT T/L spine [**12-27**]: Per radiology report, very limited study due to streak artifact from the orthopedic hardware.
The evaluation of the spinal canal from T8 to T10 is very limited, otherwise there no gross evidence of cord compression at other levels.
MR thoracic and lumabr spine w/o contrast [**12-22**]: Per radiology report, evaluation is limited from T10-T12 level.
CXR [**12-28**]: No evidence of pneumothorax.
CT Thoracolumbar spine [**2148-1-2**]: Again fixation hardware is redemonstrated consistent with transpedicular screws at T10, T11 and T12 vertebral bodies with a cage at the level of L1 and transpedicular screws in the upper lumbar spine at L2 and L3 levels.
In comparison with the most recent CT examination, the previously noted new fracture at the level of T10 on the right appears more conspicuous; however, the remainder levels are intact.
Presumably related to fracture at T10 although this is not certain as it was not seen on CT on [**2147-12-28**] and not seen on initial read of MRI on [**2147-12-29**].
BP was initially allowed to autoregulate 130-160 to maintain cord perfusion.
- PT with ROM exercises to prevent frozen joints - AFO's to prevent foot drop - Monitor for pressure sores - Discharge to Acute rehab for intensive therapy - Patient needs repeat CT of thoracolumbar spine ~7 days after discharge.
# Cervical Spinal disc disease: Patient had cervical cord impingement noted on CT from OSH.
Blood sugars at [**Hospital1 18**] were reasonably well controlled with significantly lower doses of insulin.
Transitional Issues: ==================== - Patient needs repeat CT of thoracolumbar spine ~7 days after discharge.
Fleet Enema 19-7 gram/118 mL Enema Sig: One (1)  Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for No BM in 48 hr.
Further imaging did not show a likely benefit from additional surgery or procedures at this time.
You will need to have another CT scan of your spine prior to that appointment.
