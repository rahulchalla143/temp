EKG not suggestive of ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative.
However, BP still ranged at times from high 90's-110's and pt was asymptomatic and ambulating without dizziness or difficulty.
Orthostatics were negative after IV hydration.
ECHO was repeated to ensure that cardiac function had not worsened and was found to be similiar to prior with EF 20-25%.
#acute on chronic renal failure-Presented with Cr 2.6.
#Systolic heart failure: EF 20%.
Repeat ECHO was unchanged from prior.
INR 3.1, 2, 2.6, 2.2 on day of DC.
#Reactive airways, ?COPD- continued inhalers, no sign of acute exacerbation.
#PPX: --therapeutic INR .
