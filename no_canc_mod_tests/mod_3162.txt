[**2181-11-6**] Radiology CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON 1.
[**2181-11-7**] Cardiology ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= XX %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[**2181-11-7**] Radiology ART [**Month/Day/Year **] (REST ONLY) FINDINGS: The Doppler waveform in the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal arteries is triphasic with monophasic Doppler waveform at the level of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F child psychiatrist w/ complicated PMH significant for type 1 IDDM (s/p revision renal and pancraes transplants, [**2160**] and [**2174**]), diastolic CHF (Echo 35-40%, [**7-/2181**]), recurrent MDR E coli UTIs, chronic anemia, currently on dialysis for repeated hyperkalemia, who developed fevers during dialysis and later septic shock.
CXR w/out infiltrates or opacities.
Blood Cx growing gram negative rods.
CT abdomen concerning for possible obstruction, but Pt currently completely asymptomatic.
[**11-5**] blood cultures growing E coli, sensitive to cephalosporins.
Pt can get CBC checks to ensure she is not having any marrow suppressive effects during treatment, at which time her antibiotic may be switched back to meropenem.
CXR on [**11-9**] shows increased pulmonary vasculature.
SBO: CT abdomen w/out contrast concerning for possible SBO, but Pt currently w/out any abdominal pain or nausea.
-consider CT abd w/ po contrast if clinically worsening .
# CAD/CHF: repeat echo on [**2181-11-7**] shows no vegetations, moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with moderate global hypokinesis, especially the anterior wall and septum, severe mitral regurgitation, and small ASD/stretched PFO present with left to right shunting at rest.
In comparison to echo of [**2181-10-9**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased to severe.
Estimated pulmonary systolic pressures are significantly higher.
Continue QID finger sticks for now with insulin sliding scale coverage.
C diff was negative and the diarrhea resolved on its own prior to discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Pt should continue to have CBC checks prior to HD to monitor for neutropenia while on ceftazidime (until [**11-20**]).

Your urine did not show any sign of infection, nor did your chest X-ray.
Your echocardiogram did not show any signs of endocarditis, but your prior mitral regurgitation has worsened to severe and your pulmonary hypertension is also worse.
Your blood cultures eventually grew E coli.
Your blood levels will be closely monitored to ensure that you do not develop neutropenia.
Your stool sample was negative for C diff infection.
