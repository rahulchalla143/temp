CXR [**2140-4-14**]: There is widening of the mediastinum, which has a slightly ill- defined margin.
Given that the recent CT scan, performed yesterday demonstrated an aortic ulcer with intramural hematoma and that there is a new left pleural fluid collection, clinical correlation and followup CT scan are recommended.
CXR [**2140-4-15**]: Left lower lobe pneumonia versus atelectasis.
CXR [**2140-4-16**]: There is continued marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Please refer to recent CT scan report.There is continued left lower lobe consolidation most likely indicating atelectasis.
CXR [**2140-4-17**]: Mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion.
ECHO [**2140-4-20**]: Mild symmetric left ventricular systolic function with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
CULTURE RESULTS:    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2140-4-17**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Trimethoprim/sulfa sensitivity confirmed by [**Doctor Last Name 3077**]-[**Doctor Last Name 3060**].
CT done at OSH was concerning for aortic dissection.
Upon further evaluation of images and comparison with [**2137**] studies, it was found that descending aortic aneurysm was unchanged from 2 years ago and there was no dissection.
On CT done at [**Hospital1 18**] AAA size was measured 3.7 cm.
CT did show that she had several large gallstones within the gallbladder.
On [**4-14**], the patient developed T 102 with UCx positive for E. coli >100,000 and Strep bovis in urine.
She was then continued on a 7-day course of Levaquin per ID because of better coverage of Strep bovis with Levaquin and also because of CXR finding concerning of pneumonia.
Would recommend repeating UA and culture after she completes treatment course to ensure resolution.
[**4-16**] the patient was found with new onset Afib with rapid ventricular response 130-150 with decrease in BP (SBP from 130 to mid 80s for 3 minutes).
Given history of a prior stroke which puts her at a high risk for thromboembolic events, it was felt that the patient needs to be bridged with Heparin to overlap with therapeutic INR x 2days.
Her INR was 1.3 on the day of discharge (goal [**12-24**]).
The patient did have an echocardiogram during this admission which showed normal EF, symmetric LVH and mild MR.
Goal SBP <130.
She had severe HTN with SBP in 200's requiring doses of IV Hydralazine.
The patient c/o increased cough during this admission and an ACE inhibitor was later changed to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] to eliminate it as a cause of her cough.
Her BP medications will likely need further adjustment as an outpatient.
Iron studies revealed low serum Fe/TIBC ratio, but Ferritin was >500.
Given suspicion for iron deficiency anemia and need for chronic anticoagulation as well as finding of Strep bovis in urine, GI were consulted and the patient underwent EGD and colonoscopy which were significant for gastritis and diverticuli in duodenum and sigmoid but showed no evidence of malignancy in colon.
Stomach biopsy was done and the results are pending at the time of this discharge.
CXR intially showed evidence of CH which improved clinically throughout her admission.
She was told to resume her outpatient inhalers and to continue with a nasal spray.
Enoxaparin Sodium 80 mg/0.8 mL Syringe Sig: One (1) Subcutaneous Q24H (every 24 hours) for 4 days: Please consult Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4541**] after you have INR checked on Monday if you need to continue Lovenox.
