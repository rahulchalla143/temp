IMAGING: ECG [**2138-5-3**]: Sinus rhythm.
CXR [**2138-5-3**]: The lungs are clear.
The cardiac silhouette, hilar and mediastinal contours appear normal.
# DKA/DM Type 1:  Patient's initial presentation with polyuria, polydipsia, malaise, nausea, hyperglycemia (FSBS 499), and anion gap metabolic acidosis (bicarb 13, gap 32) consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis.
Her anion gap closed overnight.
They recommended patient continue on Levemir 34 units daily as an outpatient, 10 units humalog with meals, and a humalog insulin sliding scale to cover her for additional needs.
Infectious work-up, including UA and CXR, was negative, and patient remained afebrile without localizing signs or symptoms of infection during her hospital [**Last Name (un) 10128**].
LABS/STUDIES PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: MRSA screen  ISSUES REQUIRING FOLLOW-UP -Patient will establish care with new PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] will need close follow-up at the [**Hospital **] Clinic, and will likely need ongoing adjustment to her insulin regimen -Patient may benefit from additional nutrition education as outpatient  Medications on Admission: - levemir 34U qam - humalog 15U before meals   Discharge Medications: 1.
We found your blood sugars were very high, and that your symptoms were due to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis.
