[**2133-5-21**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2133-5-25**] [**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT): No evidence of deep vein thrombosis either right or left lower extremity  Microbilogy results: [**2133-5-20**] URINE CULTURE (Final [**2133-5-22**]): ESCHERICHIA COLI.>100,000 org/ml [**2133-5-20**] Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2133-5-26**]): NO GROWTH.
[**2133-5-24**] Blood Culture: [**2133-5-24**] Urine Culture: No growth [**2133-5-26**] SPUTUM GRAM STAIN (Final [**2133-5-26**]): [**12-1**] PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper respiratory secretions.
Bacterial culture results are invalid.
POD 0 ([**2133-5-18**]): The patient was tachycardic (HR 120-130's)and was given a bolus of 1 litre of intravenous fluids.
POD 1 ([**2133-5-19**]): The patient continued to be tachycardic during the early morning hours.
She was scheduled for an urgent UGI of the abdomen to rule out any leak.
An abdominal film done at this time showed evidence of a retained foreign body possibly a sponge in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
She was then taken to the OR for an emergent exploratory laparotomy to remove the sponge.
POD 2 ([**2133-5-20**]): She was transferred to the Trauma ICU where she had a brief episode of desaturation to 80% on 4 L of O2.
A CT angiogram of the chest was performed and ruled out any pulmonary embolism.
POD 3 ([**2133-5-21**]): She continued to do well on the 10L/min  of O2 which was further weaned down to 4L/min.
Her urine culture grew E.coli and she was then started on ciprofloxacin.
POD 4 ([**2133-5-22**]): She was transferred to the floor and her diet was advanced to stage II.
POD 5 ([**2133-5-23**]): Diet was advanced to stage III which was tolerated well.
There was an increase in the WBC count from 11.4 to 13.7.
A chest x-ray was done given her persistent O2 requirement, which was concerning for a possible developing pneumonia.
POD 6 ([**2133-5-24**]): She had a fever spike to 101.9F when she was pan cultured again.
A Chest x-ray was done that showed developing pneumonia.
In view of her rising white count and recent Chest x-ray, Intavenous vancomycin and cefepime were started empirically.
Wound swabs were sent for gram stain & culture.
The gram stain did not show any organisms.
A repeat Chest x-ray was done and blood and urine cultures were sent following their recommendations.
POD 10 ([**2133-5-28**]): The abdominal wound was examined and a wound vac dressing was placed.
Her white cell count was down from 14.7 to 11.7.
POD 11 ([**2133-5-29**]): She remained afebrile with continued intravenous antibiotics; a wound vac remained in place; her tachycardia had resolved and vital signs remained stable.
POD 12 ([**2133-5-30**]): No new events  POD 13 ([**2133-5-31**]): No new events  POD 14 ([**2133-6-1**]): Antibiotics were discontinued with completion of a 7 day course.
