In ER, patient was noted to have a Tmax of 102.1 and was given steroids and vanc/ceftriaxone for suspected meningitis.

Pertinent Results: CT Head W/O contrast ([**4-19**])- 1.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**4-21**])- The lateral and third ventricles have increased in size compared to the prior study.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2155-4-21**] at 4:23:21 PM The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2152-10-23**], the mitral and aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but without discrete vegetation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2155-4-22**] 4:28 AM 1.
Stable post-surgical encephalomalacic changes in the right frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with stable right-sided craniotomy and craniectomy.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2155-4-23**] 6:11 AM Intraventricular catheters remain in place, with interval decrease in size of the lateral and third ventricles compared to [**2155-4-22**].
Head CT [**5-4**]: FINDINGS: Intraventricular shunts are unchanged in position, including right frontal approach terminating in the left lateral ventricle and the right parietal approach terminating near the atrium of the right lateral ventricle.
With the exception of right maxillary small mucus-retention cyst, imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated.
Head CT [**5-7**]: FINDINGS: There is large-volume pneumocephalus in bilateral anterior frontal horns and in the right temporal region.
Overall examination is limited by streak and motion artifact.
EKG [**5-5**]: Sinus rhythm.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 87 136 80 342/389 60 7 80  CT Head [**5-12**]: FINDINGS: There is decreased pneumocephalus compared to the previous examination.
LENIS [**5-9**]: BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] examination was performed of the both common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
The study demonstrates normal low, respiratory variation, augmentation, and compressibility.
While in the ER, she was observed to have a Tmax of 102.1 and treated with vanc/ceftriaxone for suspected meningitis.
CT scan revealed mild to moderate increase in ventricular size with VP shunt catheter in place.
Patient was then taken to the OR for suspected shunt infection and cultures were obtained.
CSF cultures were obtained and ID consulted.
Na level monitored for a level at 125.
On [**4-21**], Na level drops from 125-120 and patient placed on 2gm salt tabs, fluid restrictions of 500cc, and 3% hypertonic solution at 20/hr.
NA was monitored Q4H and her antibiotic, vancomycin, was double concentrated in NS.
In AM, NA level increased from 120 to 130, 3% hypertonic solution was discontinued and patient's NA monitored Q4H.
Patient became more lethargic and disoriented on [**4-22**], CT scan in AM showed hydrocephalus and EVDs were dropped to 5 cmH2O.
CSF cultures resent on request for ID, and nafcillin double concentrated in NS for a NA level of 127.
Follow up CT scan showed interval decrease in ventricle size from previous scan.
CSF cx pending.
Her CSF cx also showed no growth on [**4-29**] and she completed her 2 weeks course of abx.
On [**5-9**] a non-contrast head CT was done, and this showed ongoing resolution of pneumocephalus.
