On arrival to the ED, the patient's vitals were: T 97.5 BP 155-197/91-142 P 96-120 R 16-32 Sat 85%RA and 100% on CPAP [**6-11**] with 50% FiO2.
CXR revealed a left mid lung field PNA.
CTA was negative for PE but did show intralobular septal thickening c/w edema or lymphangitic spread.
ABG on CPAP was: 7.37/56/61.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p silent IMI; no prior interventions - Hypercholesterolemia - Hypertension - CHF, systolic, EF 30% by echo (Echo [**2150-2-26**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed(ejection fraction 30 percent)secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior free wall and akinesis of the posterior (inferolateral) wall; the rest of the left ventricle also appears at least mildly hypokinetic) - COPD - H/o actinic keratosis s/p cryotherapy [**2-/2150**] - Seborrheic Keratosis - H/o T1N0M0 NSCLC s/p L superior segmentectomy [**10/2147**] - New lung nodule on CT of [**2149-12-30**]: surveillance CT in [**2149-12-3**] identified a new right lower lobe nodule which was found to be FDG PET avid.
The cytology from this examination was unrevealing, however, the bronchoalveolar lavage grew an atypical mycobacterium, Mycobacterium kansasii.
Subsequent CT scan in Feruary showed decreased size of this RLL lesion.

Micro: Blood cultures on admission without growth to date.
EKG: poor baseline, ?MAT, one PVC, old TWI V5-V6, nl axis, rate 104 bpm .
Diagnostic considerations include pulmonary edema, lymphangitic spread of malignancy, and infection.
Consolidation in the mid left lung field is new as are increased interstitial markings in the right lower lobe.
A/P: 68 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, COPD, NSCLC s/p L superior segmentectomy in [**2147**], systolic dysfunction (EF 30%), recently started on home O2, who presented with hypoxic respiratory distress and PNA.
Also of question is the septal thickening on CT concerning for lymphangitic carcinoma.
Urine legionella is negative.
Sputum culture and blood cultures are without growth.
He will follow-up with a repeat chest CT within the next 2 months for further evaluation of intralobular septal thickening.
He will follow-up as previously scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  of neurology 3 days after discharge for further outpatient work-up.
The patient was NOT able to reproduce the symptoms on exam now did he have any other focal neurologic deficits.
Repeat outpatient CT scan to monitor for resolution.
