He was BIBA for further evaluation and management.
Chest x-ray demonstrated fluid overload and patient had increased respiratory rate, therefore he received furosemide 80mg IV, and was also temporarily started on NIPPV.
ABG was done 7.34/39/141.
Non-contrast CT Torso was done to assess for infection and appeared negative.
For refractory hypertension and fluid overload on chest x-ray, he was started on nitroglycerin gtt, which was turned off after blood pressure improved.
For hyperkalemia, ECG was unchanged and he received calcium gluconate 1 gram and Kayexalate 30gm PO.
CT head was also performed and showed no acute process.
Past Medical History: *Gout * MRSA/Enterococcal (not VRE) UTI [**7-9**] * DM type 2 complicated by neuropathy & retinopathy, Hgb A1c 6.8% in [**9-9**] * CAD s/p 4v CABG ([**2119**]) * PVD s/p bypass grafting (s/p L popliteal to DP bypass w/ R arm vein ([**8-4**]) ; failed - s/p revision ([**3-5**]); RLE claudication - s/p R SFA to DP saphenous vein bypass ([**5-6**]) ; stenosed distal graft - s/p atherectomy ([**9-6**])) * 2nd & 3rd degree AV block s/p pacemaker in [**2123**] * hypertension * s/p L carotid endarterectomy in [**2128**] * hyperlipidemia * known infrarenal aortic aneurysm s/p graft repair ([**12/2119**]) * anxiety/depression * osteoarthritis * chronic back pain * cataracts * chronic renal insufficiency (recent creatinine values 1.3-2.1) * H/o intermittent slurred speech with CVA diagnosed in [**9-/2129**] * H/o vertigo, uses meclizine occasionally as outpatient  Social History: Patient is a retired carpenter who lives with his wife.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.6 BP: 181/58 HR: 72 RR: 20 O2Sat: 94% Gen: alert and oriented, NAD Cardiac: RRR, no murmurs Lungs: CTAB Abd: soft, NT, +BS Ext: 2+ oedema BL   Pertinent Results:  Laboratories: Notable for Creatinine of 2.7 (baseline 1.7-2.0), potassium 6.3, lactate 2.1, UA negative for Leukocyte esterase or nitrites, WBC 18.5 with 85% PMN and 1% Bands, Hct 30.7 (baseline 34-36), normal liver enzymes.
ECG: Sinus rhythm at 76 bpm, left-atrial abnormality, normal axis, first degree AV conduction delay, normal QT intervals, poor R-wave progress, no specific ST or T-wave changes, Q-waves in III and aVF, consistent with prior inferior MI.
CT Torso on [**2131-8-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head on [**2131-8-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE on [**2131-8-6**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-9-27**], mild mitral regurgitation is now seen (may be no difference as image quality is better on the current study).
Temperature did not qualify for heat stroke (core body temperature did not reach 40.5 centigrade).
His second UA was dirty and CT torso showed foreign body in bladder, which upon cystoscopy by urology proved to be a copper wire (the reason it was in his bladder remains unknown).
He had one blood culture on [**8-2**] positive for coag-negative staph in one bottle but this was ultimately thought to be a contaminant and ceftriaxone was D/Ced at this point.
The copper wire grew out coag-positive staph which was speciated as MRSA and was the reason he was initially put on vancomycin, and this was continued until [**2131-8-8**].
At this point the vancomycin was D/Ced and switched to bactrim becasue the copper wire cultures showed the staph was also sensitive to bactrim.
FeUrea was >30.
Baseline creatinine seems to be about 1.2 and he is followed in renal clinic as an outpatient.
He peaked at a creatinine of 2.7 and with resuscitation trended down to 1.5.
<br>Bladder Foreign Body: CT scan showed foreign body in the bladder which was new since last CT scan in [**2131-4-3**].
No growth on urine culture, but patient was nevertheless treated empirically with ceftriaxone for complicated UTI as well as with vancomycin and then bactrim for MRSA on copper wire as per above.
He did have some intermittent spikes to the 180s-200s but overall his blood pressure was in the 160s.
Your blood grew a small amount of bacteria but this was likely a contaminant and not a true blood infection.
You were briefly in the ICU and your fever resolved and after you were transferred to the medical floor you were stable with no further signs of infection.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1 week                                [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 810**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 811**]  Completed by:[**2131-8-16**
