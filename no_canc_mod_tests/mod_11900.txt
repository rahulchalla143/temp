He was found there to be afebrile with bp 115/72, hr 130, rr 20, and spo2 97%ra; his lungs had bibasilar rales, and his periphery showed 1+ edema.
His ECG showed afib and flutter with pvc's, and a CXR showed CHF.
He was given diltiazem 20mg IV once, prompting a transition to a-flutter in the 80's, with his bp dropping to 60's-70's.
On dopamine, his bp came up to the 120's and hr back up to the 130's, and he was transferred for further management.
His bp was in the 90's on a low dose of a norepi gtt (changed from dopa for tachycardia and ectopy).

Tissue synchronization imaging demonstrates no significant left ventricular dyssynchrony.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
cxr [**2158-11-9**] FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in supine position demonstrates the presence of an ETT terminating in the trachea some 6 cm above the level of the carina.
Diffuse perivascular haze is noted on this portable examination and the patient appears to be in pre-edema state.
Following this, spironolactone was added both for his CHF and for its potentially salubrious effect on cardiac remodeling, done with an eye towards the subseuqently discussed dysrhythmias.
To further investigate, a surface echo was performed with the results above, most significantly an EF of 20%.
#Atrial flutter, fib, and tachycardia -- Probably the cause of his low EF, he was found to be in aflutter with a rapid ventricular response at presentation.
His occasional atrial tachycardia episodes (hear rate around 110-120) were asymptomatic and without other hemodynamic consequences.
The plan for the amiodarone is to continue it at 400mg daily for a total of 14 days (to finish [**2158-11-27**]) then transition to 200mg daily.
#Renal failure -- He seems to have some componenet of chronic renal insufficiency, based on his Cr of 1.4 in [**2155**].
Other reasons included an increased lisinopril dose, so on [**11-14**] his dose was lowered from 10mg to 5mg and amiodarone intitiation, which blocks tubular secretion of creatinine, thus causing the apperance of renal failure with no actual changes in glomerular filtration.
#Anemia --- His hct was 40 in [**2155**].
The anemia was stable and is likely a combination of CRI, hypervolemia, and ACD.
His A1c was only 5.9, and it was felt he could get formal fasting blood glucose tested as an outpatient for glucose intolerance and consideration of starting an oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
You have recovered for an episode of low blood pressure and a fast heart rate (atrial flutter) for which your medications have been adjusted.
You are being discharged on a blood thinner to prevent strokes and will need to have labs checked weekly to make sure the medication is working appropriately.
