Somewhat limited study due to low lung volumes.
[**2118-9-20**] CXR There is minimally increased opacity seen projecting over the left heart margin.
[**2118-9-20**] CT Head with contrast: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct.
[**2118-9-22**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST: Multifocal peribronchovascular and peripheral ground-glass opacities and consolidation progressive over a week, most likely viral or mycoplasma pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or idiopathic pneumonia such as acute interstitial or eosinophilic varieties.
[**2118-9-26**] CT ABD w/ CONTRAST: Massive abdominal and pelvic ascites with thickened bowel , most likely consistent with anasarca.
[**2118-10-6**] DUPLEX DOPPLER ABDOMEN - Cirrhosis, without a focal liver lesion seen.
PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 32715**] Bactrim begun on [**2118-9-22**], PCP confirmed by bronchoscopy performed on [**2118-9-23**].
Plan to continue prednisone (D1 [**2118-9-27**]), clindamycin (D1 [**2118-9-27**]), and primaquine (D1 [**2118-9-26**])to [**2118-10-12**].
As of [**10-5**] ambulating sats 100% RA at rest to 96% RA walking.
Headache: CT and LP were negative for intracranial mass or infection.
Vancomycin and Zosyn discontinued after blood cultures returned negative.
Acute decompensation during hospital stay with distended abdomen, abdominal pain, and mental status changes attributed to hepatic encephalopathy.
SBP ruled out by peritoneal fluid analysis; imaging of abdomen negative.
Anemia: Lowest hematocrit at 21.5; hematocrit 30.6 on admission.
Two units transfused with good effect, hematocrit returned to 33.0.
Low retic count suggests bone marrow suppression as well as possible hemolytic component.
Acute renal failure: Creatinine 0.9 on admission, with peak at 1.7 on [**9-28**], likely multifactorial given nephrotoxicity of Bactrim and CT contrast as well as  hypovolemia.
Because your white blood cell count dropped, your antibiotics were changed to a different antibiotic.
