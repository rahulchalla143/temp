CXR ([**10-6**]):  IMPRESSION: Limited study with retrocardiac opacity suggesting segmental collapse of the left lower lobe.
On arrival a CTA was done which revealed a pulmonary embolism in the right pulmonary artery.
LLL Collapse: In addition to the PE described above, initial imaging also revealed left lower lung lobe collapse with debris.
Therapeutic bronchoscopy was performed on the floor confirming mucus plugging and the LLL was transiently re-expanded however it collapsed again.
