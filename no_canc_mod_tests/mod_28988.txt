She had positive CK, MB, and troponins on admission, and cardiac enyzmes trended down.
However, after recurrent episode of chest pain, cardiac enzymes again were elevated.
She is scheduled for a repeat echo in 1 month, prior to her follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She underwent an abdominal MRI/MRA which did not show pheochromocytoma or renal artery stenosis.
Iron studies c/w iron deficiency anemia (low iron and ferritin, although unclear why [**Name (NI) 59658**] not increased).
Hct was stable during the admission.
Head CT was negative for bleed.
Incidental findings: Pt was found to have a small thyroid nodule seen on chest CT (may need outpatient f/u with ultrasound) and auditory canal thickening seen on head CT (may need outpatient f/u with MRI).
Discharge Instructions: Seek medical attention immediately if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fevers, chills, bleeding from cath site, headache, hearing loss, ringing in ears, or any other concerning symptoms.
You should have your blood pressure, hematocrit, and potassium checked at the next visit with him.
You were also found on head CT to have a bulbous appearance of both internal auditory canals, which may represent a congenital variant, although masses could not be ruled out.
