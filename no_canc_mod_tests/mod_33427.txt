EKG was notable for non-specific ST-T wave changes, no prior for comparison.
Her troponin was 0.66.
Repeat Head CT performed due to concern for ICH, as patient was started on heparin.
Head CT was negative.
A 2nd set of CE's was drawn and troponin was 1.10.
EKG was checked and patient had new ST elevations in V3-V5, with concern for STEMI.
