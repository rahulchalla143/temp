Color and spectral Doppler evaluation of the main, left, and right portal veins demonstrate patency with hepatopetal flow.
The right kidney measures 12.6 cm and the left kidney measures 12.1 cm.
TTE [**2155-6-6**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
He presented with elevated Tbili to 4.5, INR that would peak at 3.3, ALT ~7,000, AST ~15,000, LDH 3,800.
A transplant work-up was done, but will likely be unnecessary.
By discharge, his INR was 1.4, alt/ast were < 1000, t bili normalizing.
His creatinine was 5.9 on admission, peaked at 7.3, and he was discharged w/ a creatinine of 2.0.
Urine output remained good during this time.
As his blood pressure was as high as 180's/110's, and we wanted to avoid further kidney injury, he was started on labetolol 200mg PO BID.
If he continues to have HTN, once [**Last Name (un) **] resolves, likely he should be switched to a different [**Doctor Last Name 360**] given he is a young, active male, and a beta-blocker would not be first line therapy.
