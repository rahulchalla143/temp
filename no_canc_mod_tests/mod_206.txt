PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, vital signs 97.7, blood pressure 90/60, heart rate 101, respiratory rate 29, oxygen saturation 90% on 2 liters.
The neck showed no jugular venous distention, no bruits.
The lungs showed decreased air movement and were wheezy.
Neurological examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, significant for a white blood cell count of 23.7, hematocrit 43.5, platelets 651.
Liver function tests were normal.
Creatinine 0.5.
Chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.
On [**11-15**], the patient was found to have oxygen saturations as low as 53%.
She was placed on 100% non-rebreather, which improved her saturations to 100%.
Oral/nasal suctioning was started, and the patient was breathing better.
An arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.3, PCO2 89, PO2 200 on 100% non-rebreather.
Chest x-ray showed worsening right upper lobe pneumonia.
Chest x-ray showed emphysematous blebs in her left lower lobe, and continuing right pleural effusion that layered.
By [**11-19**], her pressure support on the ventilator was decreased to 10, although she failed a spontaneous breathing trial.
However, a short trial of pressure support [**3-28**] with increased respiration, decreased tidal volume, subsequent arterial blood gas of 7.31/84/54, and the patient had to be put back on pressure support of 15 with 5 of PEEP.
On [**11-24**], later in the day, Mrs. [**Known lastname 4427**] was able to communicate her wishes to proceed with a trach and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, and her son consented for the procedures.
