CT scan revealed left parietal hemorrhage consistent with hemorrhagic conversion of a left inferior MCA infarct (possibly seen on OSH head CT from [**1-3**]).
VS were SBP 148, HR 122, SaO2 98%, FS 183.

Sensation was intact to light touch bilaterally, but the patient seemed to demonstrate some left/right confusion.
On laboratory evaluation in the morning after admission, there was no clear toxic, metabolic, or infectious etiology as a precipitant for the underlying seizure focus.
A drop in her hemaglobin and hematocrit was believed to be due to hemodilution, given IV fluid resuscitation and the drop in counts of all cellular elements toward her baseline values on previous admissions; there was no evidence of bleeding.
Sensation was intact to light touch bilaterally, but the patient seemed to demonstrate some left/right confusion.
