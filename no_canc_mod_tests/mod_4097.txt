In the ED, the patient's VS were T 97.0, P 63, BP 135/80, R 20, O2 99% on RA.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn, which were within his normal range.
CXR was performed which showed a LLL effusion.
The patient was then admitted to CC7 for further workup and evaluation.
Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient has a h/o CHF, with an EF of 20%.
- Lasix 60 mg IV now and continue with plan for CHF as outlined above  - Send urine Na, Cr, and Urea in light of diuretic use to calculate FeUrea  - Continue to trend Cr and UOP .
Cardiac enzymes were elevated in the ED, though they appear to be at his baseline (0.10) and the patient does not have any significant ECG changes on admission.
The patient's troponins are most likely elevated in the setting of acute renal failure.
Replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0 .
Dispo:  To home v. rehab pending evaluation of above.
