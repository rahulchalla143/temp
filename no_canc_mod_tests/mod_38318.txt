In the ED, a head CT was delayed while waiting for an HCG result.
Head CT/CTA was then performed revealing SAH and basilar trunk aneurysm.
Able to ambulate without assistance   Pertinent Results: CTA Head [**2183-4-15**] 1.
This may be better assessed by conventional angiography, which will presumably be pursued for evaluation of the basilar aneurysm.
CXR [**2183-4-15**] Optimal position of endotracheal tube.
Cerebral Angiogram [**2183-4-15**] [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 16462**] underwent cerebral angiography and coil embolization  of a right basilar trunk aneurysm, which was facilitated by the use of a stent.
CXR [**2183-4-16**] AP chest compared to [**4-15**] at 10:51 a.m.
CT head [**2183-4-16**] Status post basilar stenting and aneurysm coiling with no complication visualized.
CXR [**2183-4-17**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased.
CTP/CTA [**2183-4-18**] 1.
Subtle subarachnoid hemorrhage seen on the CT of the head.
CT perfusion demonstrates no evidence of abnormalities to indicate ischemia or infarction.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates stent-assisted coiling of the basilar artery aneurysm without evidence of significant vasospasm.
TCDs on [**4-18**] showed above normal velocities in the right middle cerebral artery, right anterior cerebral artery, and basilar artery, but none of the vessels had evidence of vasospasm.
Her serum NA was 141 and she was on salt tabs and they were decreased to 1 gm tid.
Her potassium was low to 3.1 and this was repleted.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
