He underwent cardiac catheterization that showed left main tight stenosis with 3-vessel disease.

2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[**2148-11-18**] Cardiac Catheterization 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics showed a normal central aortic pressure (AO mean 81 mmHg).
An IABP was inserted via the right femeral artery using a long 8F sheath.

The renal service was consulted given his creatinine of 6.1.
It was assumed that he would likely need to start hemodialysis post cardiac catheterization.
On [**2148-11-18**] a cardiac catheterization was performed.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection fraction of 30-35% and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which revealed mild (<40%)plaque/wall thickening present in the carotid arteries bilaterally.
A renal ultrasound was also performed which showed Bilateral renal cysts, no evidence of normal renal parenchyma and underlying mass could not be excluded.
A fistulogram was performed with angiodilation of an outflow stenosis.
His Coumadin was adjusted for a goal INR of 1.5-2.
He will have his INR drawn during dialysis and Coumadin followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 47285**].
