At [**Hospital3 3834**], the patient was found to be hypotensive, anemic with a hematocrit of 24, and in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 4.1, coagulopathic, INR 4.5.
Course was complicated by hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 70s, given 200 cc/hour IV fluids, and dobutamine 2 mg/kg/minute.
Echocardiogram obtained showed a 1-3 cm circumferential pericardial effusion with early tamponade, question for left atrial collapse, no pulsus paradoxus noted.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.
Systolic blood pressure in the 70s with lightheadedness, neck and jaw pain.
Bedside echocardiogram demonstrated diastolic RV collapse with INR of 4.7, 4 units of FFP infused, as well as 5 mg of IV vitamin K.  An atrial line was placed which demonstrated inspiratory variation.
Renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine of 1.5-2.
VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile, 97.6, blood pressure 82/60, dopamine 5 mcg, rate 63, ventricular paced, respirations 18, and 93% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Pulmonary:  Anterolateral clear to auscultation with decreased breath sounds at left base.
Dopplerable DP and PT pulses.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.2, hematocrit 30.7 status post 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Sodium 124, potassium 5.7, chloride 93, bicarb 18, BUN 84, creatinine 4.0, glucose 132, INR of 4.5.
Echocardiogram showed minimal residual fluid.
Filling pressures remained elevated with wide respiratory variation with RA pressure 35, PA 60/30, and PCW 35.
Improvement in cardiac output and resolution of paradoxical pulse.
Runs of VT with good blood pressure noted during procedure possibly related to catheterization manipulation.
Repeat echocardiogram showed minimal change and small amount of pericardial effusion, no tamponade physiology.
INR was reversed successfully to 1.8 on hospital day one.
Elevated PA diastolic pressures of 22 post procedure suggest volume overload in the setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation during periods of hypertension.
CBC consistent with hemorrhagic fluid.
EP evaluation was obtained to assess proper lead placement suspicious for LV lead position on chest x-ray.
At time of discharge, patient had baseline creatinine of 1.2.
ID:  Viral bacterial serologies were sent for pericardial analysis.
Gram negative cultures negative at time of dictation.
Chest x-ray negative for pneumothorax post procedure.
