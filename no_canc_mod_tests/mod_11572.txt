The patient was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate at that time and a white blood count of 19.2 consistent with pneumonia and worsening of chronic renal insufficiency.
BUN and creatinine of 6.5 and 3.2.
Baseline creatinine was known to be 2.4-2.5.
White blood count was [**Last Name (LF) 28645**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient was started on empiric Flagyl.
Sputum culture was without significant growth, but chest x-ray was questionable for new left-sided infiltrate.
White count was found to be 18.
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate, hematocrit of 28.7.
In the Emergency Department, the patient's vitals were found to be temperature of 98 degrees, heart rate of 48, blood pressure of 80/60, and 88 percent on room air.
The patient was placed on nonrebreather with O2 saturations 99 percent.
An ABG at this time was 7.42, 20, and 57.
The patient was given 600 cc bolus of normal saline without effect and was subsequently started on dopamine and blood pressure improved to 110/60.
A left IJ was placed at the outside hospital, and the patient was also given a dose of Lasix 40 mg x 1, vancomycin 1 g x 1, and imipenem 500 mg.
At [**Hospital1 18**], the vitals found to be temperature of 97 degrees, heart rate 66, blood pressure 68/16, respiratory rate 24, and 99 percent on nonrebreather.
Hematocrit was found to be 25.7 (baseline of 31).
An ABG at this time showed pH of 7.30, pCO2 of 26, and paO2 of 77, and lactate was 1.4.
Chest x-ray was repeated showing left lower lobe infiltrate.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 2.4- 2.5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the MICU, temperature 96.4 degrees, heart rate 58, blood pressure 105/37, breathing 99 percent on a 100 percent nonrebreather.
Harsh crescendo and decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border.
LABS AT PRESENTATION:  White count 18.5, hematocrit 25.7, platelets 134, BUN 97, creatinine of 3.0, and glucose is 183.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  EKG showed atrial fibrillation with left axis, 2-mm ST depressions in V2-V6, T-wave inversions in 1 and aVL.
Again, chest x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate.
Urine output was stable.
At this time, CVP was noted to be 12, RA pressures 47/7 and PA pressures 47/20, and respiratory wedge was found to be 14 with a mean wedge of 18.
Cardiac index at this time was 2.91 and cardiac output 7.1, SVR 585, and SVO2 of 67.
Urine Legionella antigen was checked and found to be negative.
A broncho with BAL was performed; however, all microbiology remained negative.
A CT scan was obtained showing no significant abdominal pathologies.
However, LFTs, amylase, and lipase remained stable.
The patient's creatinine remained stable and had improved to baseline.
The patient's urine output also remained stable.
However, again, urine output remained stable.
The patient was transfused to maintain a hematocrit above 30 and the patient was continued on aspirin and Plavix especially in the setting of recent stent.
An echo was rechecked, showing again the EF of 60-65 percent with severe AS.
Surveillance cultures and sputum cultures remained negative.
