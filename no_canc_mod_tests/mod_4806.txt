IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # [**Numeric Identifier 23696**]          FROM [**9-28**].
................................................ EKG [**9-29**]: Sinus rhythm.
EKG [**10-2**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing voltage has increased but remains low.
EKG [**10-3**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2119-9-29**] voltage has diminished.
THE EKG FROM [**10-3**] WAS MARKED AS THOUGH IT WERE FROM [**9-29**].
.....................................................  ECHO [**10-3**]: Conclusions:  EF 50% The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2116-5-7**], segmental wall motion abnormality is new.
CXR [**10-3**]: IMPRESSION: Probable ileus given the extent of small bowel dilatation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  * AMI:  She had an EKG that was initially read as consistent with anterior j-point elevation and sinus tachycardia, but the final read was acute MI.
No further CE's were sent at the time.
The enzymes trended down over days.
EKG normalized over subsequent days (NOTE: EKG reads in the computer are dated wrong.
The EKG dated [**2119-9-29**] 11pm was actually taken on [**2119-10-3**] and showed complete resolution of ST changes with ?
ECHO showed inferoapical hypokinesis that was new compared to the ECHO of [**2116**] and an EF of 50% (prior was 65%).
The PMD was notified of the event and we worked closely with her to establish the proper regimen of cardioprotective medications and follow-up plan including VNA, home PT, and close f/u with her PMD and establishment at that time of f/u with a cardiologist.
The patient was placed on RISS, and the blood glucose never went above 200.
On the medical floor, the patient was restarted on her home regimen of long acting insulin and her blood glucose was very well controlled.

Because of this, your blood pressure decreased.
If you begin to gain weight (>4 lbs), you should call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1683**] - this could be because you are retaining water because your heart is not pumping as efficiently as it should.
If you develop any new symptoms, such as light-headedness, fainting, chest pain, shortness of breath, increasing confusion, fever or chills, or other worrisome symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention.
NOTE:  Pt had an MI during sepsis and has new inferoapical WMA on echo with a decreased ef (50%).
