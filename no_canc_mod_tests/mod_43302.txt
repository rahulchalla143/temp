She has had negative lower extremity Dopplers for DVT in the past as well as CT angiograms felt to demonstrate evidence of pulmonary embolism.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the following:  Blood pressure 180/100, heart rate 100, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation initially was 50%, subsequently, the patient was intubated.
JVP was not appreciated due to soft tissue.
Post intubation, the lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly with diffuse rhonchi posteriorly and laterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admitting labs revealed the following:  BUN and creatinine 20 and 1.7.
Hematocrit 42.7.
The patient was treated aggressively with antihypertensive regimen, as well as diuresis, appropriate amounts of sedation as the patient was highly anxious with minimal stimulation with increase in her pulmonary artery pressures to systolic measurements of 100 mmHg.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed early in the hospital stay to rule out shunting, but there was no evidence of any intracardiac shunting to explain the pulmonary hypertension.
Lower extremity Dopplers were done.
RENAL:  The patient had stable BUN and creatinines throughout the hospital stay.
