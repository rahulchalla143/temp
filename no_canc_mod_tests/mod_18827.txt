The echo at that time showed no coronary disease with an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm with a mean gradient of 45, an EF of 59 percent, an LVEDP of 10, aortic valve heavily calcified.
Echocardiogram from one year prior to catheterization showed an aortic valve area of 0.75 cm2.
Repeat echo done in [**12/2177**] showed left ventricular hypertrophy with significant aortic calcification and aortic valve area of 0.4 to 0.5 cm2 with a peak gradient of 70 mm/Hg.
MEDICATIONS:  Her medications prior to catheterization include: 1.
Calcium carbonate.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.8, hematocrit 35.9, platelets 242, PT 12.9, INR 1.1.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.2, chloride 105, CO2 24, BUN 28, creatinine 0.6, glucose 105.
ALT 13, AST 17, alkaline phosphatase 62, amylase 56, direct bilirubin 0.1, albumin 4.0.
Chest x-ray showed mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with no evidence of CHF.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Height 5 feet, 0 inches, weight 146 pounds.
Vital signs:  Heart rate 85, blood pressure 137/68, respiratory rate 14, O2 saturation 100 percent on room air.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her chest was left open with a rubber [**Doctor Last Name **] and she was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of transfer the patient's mean arterial pressure was 96.
Her CVP was 17 with a PAD of 19.
On postoperative day seven the patient returned to the Operating Room, at which time she had her chest closed.
On postoperative day eight the patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab for a diagnostic catheterization which showed a tight right coronary artery lesion which was stented at that time.
The bronchoscopy showed diffuse blood in the airways with bleeding from the right upper lobe.
At that time, she had two new mediastinal tubes, mean arterial pressure of 92 with a CVP of 19.
The patient did well over the next three postoperative days, and on [**2178-3-6**] she again returned to the Operating Room, at which time her chest was closed.
She had a mean arterial pressure of 92.
She was in a sinus rhythm at 106 beats per minute with a CVP of 23 and PAD of 24.
She continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service as her white count had been greater than 20 since the implantation of the right ventricular assistive device.
On [**2178-3-8**] a culture of the [**MD Number(3) 52953**] was positive for yeast.
On [**2178-3-27**] she had a video swallow evaluation which she passed.
However, by [**2178-4-2**] the incision showed necrotic tissue in the base of the wound and her sternum was felt to be unstable.
At this time the patient's physical exam is as follows.
Vital signs:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate 91, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 128/53, respiratory rate 22, O2 saturation 99 percent on 35 percent trach collar.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.7, hematocrit 31, platelets 290, sodium 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 102, CO2 27, BUN 29, creatinine 0.4, glucose 84.
Breath sounds clear to auscultation bilaterally.
4 hours for a     temperature greater than 38.0 C. 16.
