Her hospital course then was also complicated by myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 0.83 and the development of hematuria while receiving Heparin.
The patient refused cardiac catheterization at that time decided to desire to avoid aggressive procedures.
She was emergently intubated in [**Hospital6 8283**], and transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further care.
Her blood gas in the Emergency Department of said hospital was 7.23, 57, 227 without documentation of ventilatory settings.
In our Emergency Department, the patient received another 2 mg of Morphine, and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was not recorded initially.
The heart rate was 86.
The blood pressure was 135/65.
The respiratory rate was 10.
On volume supported assist control with a rate of 10, a PEEP was 10 cm, FIO2 was 0.6, the SPO2 was 100%.
Chest:  Lung fields are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Rectal examination reveals the presence of occult blood.
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  In the outside hospital, her hematocrit was 32, platelets were 335, her white blood cell count was 10,000.
In our Emergency Department, the CBC was as follows:  White blood cell count 9,000, hemoglobin 8.4 mg/dl, hematocrit 26.2%, platelets 171,000.
INR 1.2.
Chemistry panel:  Sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 109, bicarbonate 27.
Blood, urea, and nitrogen 28, creatinine 1.9.
Glucose 167.
Calcium 9, phosphate 3.8, magnesium 2.2.
Cardiac troponin-T was 0.12.
Arterial blood gas on ventilatory settings was described at 7.37, 48, 142.
Blood cultures were drawn.
ECG showed unchanged, sinus rhythm at 76 beats per minute and a presence of a left bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray shows stable massive cardiomegaly.
Interval echocardiogram showed the following: 1.
Left ventricular ejection fraction of 15-20%.
As shown in the laboratory evaluation summarized above and in the OMR, the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction by elevated troponin.
Serial CKs showed rapid clearance of cardiac markers.
Serial hematocrits did not show evidence of acute blood loss and her INR was normal as was her platelets.
