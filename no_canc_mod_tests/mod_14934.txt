ABD US [**12-30**]:  Right liver lobe hemangioma.
CXR [**12-31**]:  1.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**12-31**]:  1.
[**12-31**] Liver transjugular biopsy: 1.
Acute submassive hepatic necrosis, centrolobular and mid-zonal areas (zones [**1-3**]).
Transthoracic echo [**1-1**]:  Conclusions: 1.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Renal biopsy [**2109-1-4**]:  DIAGNOSIS: Renal Biopsy, needle: Advanced Global Glomerulosclerosis, Interstitial Fibrosis, and Tubular Atrophy, see note.
Electron Microscopy (C4047) : Fine structural studies of  a single glomerular tuft with advanced injury reveal that most capillaries show obsolescence with loss of cellular elements.
The findings are that of advanced injury that cannot be specifically categorized..  CT ABD/PELVIS [**1-5**]:  1.
1) Liver failure:  On admission, she was found to have transaminases in the 8000 range, as well as INR 3.8, PT 24.5, albumin 3.0, Total bili 9.2, and LDH 12,610.
A number of blood tests were sent off to ascertain the etiology of her liver failure, however they were uniformly negative (these included tylenol, [**Doctor First Name **], CMV, EBV, toxoplasma, Hepatitis serologies, leptospirosis, and porphyria).
She underwent a transjugular liver biopsy on the 3rd day of the admission, which showed a non-specific pattern of injury consistent with drug/toxic or ischemic disease.
She unfortunately developed a subcapsular liver hematoma during the procedure, however this was stabilized with FFP and Vitamin K which the patient had already been receiving.
She also received 2 U PRBC, and hematocrit was subsequently stable.
A repeat abdominal CT scan later in the course demonstrated resolution of the hematoma.
During her hospitalization she received more than 14 units of FFP to keep her INR < 1.5, as well as DDAVP x 5, and multiple dosese of vitamin K.  Prior to discharge, her INR had remained < 1.5 on it's own for > 48 hours.
Her transaminases had trended down almost into the normal range (111 and 41 for ALT and AST respectively), and her total bilirubin had trended down to 5.9 from a peak of 40.3.
2) Acute on chronic renal failure:  On admission she was also in acute renal failure with creatinine of 5.7.
By report from the outside hospital, her recent baseline Cr was 2.8 in [**8-4**].
Hepatorenal syndrome was in the differential, however her urine sodium was elevated, therefore this diagnosis could not be made.
Initial urine sediment was felt to be consistent with ATN or AIN (RBCs, no acanthocytes, occasional WBC, hyaline casts, occasional renal tubular epithelial cells, granular casts, no muddy brown casts or rbc casts).
A renal US revealed echogenic kidneys consistent with parenchymal disease.
A later urine sediment showed many acanthocytic and dysmorphic rbcs, many casts, granular and bite stained, no WBCs, no RBC casts, occasional RTE cells, and 100 mg/dl protein.
A renal biopsy was recommended.
Ms. [**Known lastname 59022**] had a renal biopsy on day 6 of her admission.
Post-biopsy she developed flank pain, and was noted to have a hematocrit drop from 31 to 25.
A CT of the abdomen demonstrated a moderate-sized perinephric hematoma.
Her hematocrit stabilized and she had no further flank pain prior to discharge.
Her creatinine on discharge was still markedly above baseline at 6.1, and she was exhibiting mild signs of volume overload (orthopnea, peripheral edema).
Her wbc was elevated on admission, however this was felt to be related to the acute liver injury, and trended down throughout the admission.
Her oxygen saturation was consistenly > 95%.
On the floors, Mrs.[**Known lastname 59024**] blood pressure was moderately well controlled on metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], and amlodipine 10 mg daily.
Review of peripheral smear was consistent with stress hematopoesis due to acute liver failure and not autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
Her hematocrit was stable between 30 and 32 prior to discharge.
We have also started you on a new medication for your blood pressure called amlodipine, 10 mg daily.
