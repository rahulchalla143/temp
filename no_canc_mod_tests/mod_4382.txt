According to reports, her blood pressure was 125/82 and pulse 93.
Fingerstick was 255 and he was transported to [**Hospital3 **] for further evaluation.
The patient underwent a stroke evaluation by the [**Hospital1 878**] and Vascular Surgery services.
MRI brain showed acute and subacute infarcts of the left occipital, temporal, parietal, frontal lobes and the left cerebellum.
MRA brain and neck showed no flow above the petrous ICA bilaterally with an occluded left vertebral.
A carotid ultrasound on [**12-27**] showed 80% occlusion of the right ICA and 100% occlusion of the left ICA.
However, subsequent carotid ultrasound done in Dr.[**Name (NI) 33385**] office on [**1-13**] showed a probable occlusion of the RIGHT ICA, possible occlusion of the LEFT ICA, and occlusion of the left vertebral artery.
The angiogram was scheduled for [**1-28**], and he was to be admitted the evening before for bicarbonate hydration and Mucomyst, given his renal failure  Past Medical History: 1.
[**11-28**] echo: EF >55%, no evidence of LVH   Social History: Denies hx of smoking, ETOH, or other drug use.

URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       PROTEUS MIRABILIS.
CT perfusion demonstrates elevated mean transit time and decreased blood flow and volume involving the entire left MCA and left PCA territory, consistent with completed infarction.
The left posterior cerebral artery, which is fetal in origin, also demonstrates an abrupt cut-off consistent with occlusion.
No clear source of embolism seen, but study quality precludes evaluation of left atrium.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the Neuro-ICU for further evaluation and treatment of his new rigth sided weakness.
He had an MRI which demonstrated new DWI changes in the left MCA territory representing a new infarct, likely embolic from his occluded ICA.
He was monitored with cardiac telemetry and frequent neuro-checks.
He passed his swallow evaluation with speech therapy.
His Cr increased on [**1-28**] and he was given a bolus of NS.
His exam has been stable since admission.
