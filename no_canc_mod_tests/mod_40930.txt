CATH [**2184-9-15**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Venous conduit angiography demonstrated total SVG-LAD occlusion proximally.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressure with a central aortic pressure of 132/75 mmHg.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid vessel SVG-LAD stent thrombosis with a 4.0x28mm Promus Element RX stent which was postdilated distal and mi to 4.0mm and proximally to 4.5mm.
ECHO [**2184-9-16**]: IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with globally preserved left ventricular systolic function (EF>55%) in the presence of hypokineisis of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral, as well as the mid and distal septal segments.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-3-26**], the septal wall motion abnormalities are new and the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased (previously mild to moderate).
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo male with long h/o CAD, mild stable angina, who presented to clinic with severe chest pain not relieved by SL Nitro and EKG consistent with STEMI with global ischemia.
He was treated with ASA 325, Plavix, Crestor 40mg, and Metop succinate 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
Follow-up echo on [**9-16**] showed normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with globally preserved LV systolic function (EF>55%) in the presence of hypokinesis of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral, as well as the mid and distal septal segments.
Follow-up echo on [**9-16**] showed Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with globally preserved left ventricular systolic function in the presence of hypokineisis of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral, as well as the mid and distal septal segments.
The head of his bed was reclined, and he was given IV fluids, which brought up his pressure and his heart rate.
Transitional Issues: - consider long dose nitro for additional anti-angina benefit - consider Ranexa  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from Patient.
An echocardiogram showed the area of the heart where the muscle is not moving well but overall your heart function is OK. You will need to restart some of the medicines you were on in the past to ensure that your heart muscle recovers well.
