Patient was admitted on [**2166-9-15**], with 8 out of 10 chest pain to an outside hospital, transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization.
Catheterization showed ejection fraction of 50%, 100% native LAD disease, 90% thrombotic OM1 lesion, 100% proximal RCA lesion, occluded saphenous vein graft to OM1 and LIMA to LAD small but filling the distal LAD.
On [**9-16**] the patient began complaining of back pain radiating to his chest wall and jaw.
Electrocardiogram at that time showed increased ST depression.
Cardiac enzymes continued to trend upward.
EKG continued to show ST depression.
Patient's cardiac enzymes continued to trend upward and Cardiac Surgery was consulted.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: 1.
In the Operating Room patient was noted to have an ejection fraction of 55% with preserved right ventricular systolic function.
Patient had blood, urine and sputum cultures sent as well as a chest x-ray done, all of which were negative for infectious process.
On postoperative day patient's hematocrit was noted to be 22.6, on repeat 23.2.
All cultures that had been sent continued to be negative with the exception of a sputum culture that had Gram positive cocci, Gram positive rods, epithelial cells and PMMs consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
The patient was started on diltiazem infusion for control of his heart rate with moderate results.
On postoperative day four patient continued on diltiazem infusion at 20 mg an hour and atrial fibrillation with heart rate of 120.
The results of these cultures were negative.
No need for anticoagulation as the patient had converted into sinus rhythm unless the patient had further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Right upper extremity vascular ultrasound was obtained to rule out deep venous thrombosis.
After three Clostridium difficile cultures came back negative the Flagyl was discontinued.
Colonoscopy was performed on postoperative day 11 which showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, descending colon and splenic flexure.
On postoperative day 13 after discussions with the Infectious Disease team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**], it was felt that as the patient had no positive cultures and the white blood cell count was down, the suspected source for the elevated leukocytosis was the thrombophlebitis and the patient would be safe for discharge to home on oral levofloxacin for two weeks.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  T-max 98.6, pulse 65 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 100/57, respiratory rate 15.
Room air oxygen saturation 96%.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 12.1, hematocrit 27.6, platelet count 639.
Sodium 141, potassium 3.9, chloride 108, bicarb 26, BUN 8, creatinine 0.8 and glucose 113.
Gastrointestinal:  Abdomen soft, non-tender, non-distended, positive bowel sounds, no further diarrhea.
