Upon placement of foley a blood clot returned but urine turned clear with continuous irrigation.
Patient's blood pressure improved to 100-110 with 3 L NS but prior to ICU transfer became hypotensive (SBP 80s) requiring central line placement and started on Levophed.

IMPRESSION: TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were acquired through the pelvis following injection of contrast via the Foley catheter.
CXR [**12-7**]-FINDINGS: Again seen, is a left-sided cardiac pacer/defibrillator with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
EKG clips and wires overly the chest and somewhat limit evaluation.
IMPRESSION: New opacity in the right mid-lung may represent infection or mass - dedicated PA and lateral views or a chest CT recommended - discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 49784**] at 19:53 on [**2168-12-7**].
CXR [**12-9**]-The position of the right internal jugular line and pacemaker leads is stable.
If patient is short of breath, it might be attributed actually to diffuse interstitial lung disease and correlation with dedicated chest CT may be considered.

Reversed with 5mg PO vitamin K. INR trended down and [**12-11**] subtherapeutic.
Pt now therapeutic INR 2.5.
INR elevated, given vit K, then heparin/coumadin started.
