Breath sounds were distant but equal.
Pulses were 2+ and equal.
Tone was appropriate for gestational age.

FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: He was maintained NPO and had IV fluids of D10W at 80 ml/kg which was increased.
He required one bolus of D10W for initial D-stick of 37, and remained euglycemic thereafter on running IV fluids.
Electrolytes were monitored and found to be in the normal range.
Urine output was noted to be normal and [**Known lastname 46241**] passed stool on day 1 and has passed meconium in transitional stools.

A repeat platelet count was 41.
A follow up CBC obtained on [**8-16**] 168K.
NEUROLOGIC: Head ultrasound screening for intraventricular hemorrhage is being performed on [**8-16**].
The results of this study are pending at this time.
AUDIOLOGY: A hearing screening has not yet been performed.
