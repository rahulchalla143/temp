INR was noted Vitamin K.  Shortly after the bleeding began, the patient became acutely short of breath believed to be due to aspiration of blood.
Oxygen saturations at that time were noted to be 85%.
In the [**State 1558**] Emergency Room, hematocrit was 29.2.
The patient was transfused 2 U of packed red blood cells with a repeat hematocrit of 39.
The patient was also given 2 L normal saline and an additional 2.5 mg of Vitamin K for an INR of 4.25.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates, and the patient was started on Levaquin 500 mg. White blood count was 16.2 with 14% bands.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were subsequently sent.
Head MRI was consistent with ischemic cerebrovascular accident of the left ventricular nucleus.
Questionable glucose intolerance with fasting blood sugar of 140 during last admission.
Vital signs:  Temperature 104.8?????
?, blood pressure 120/90 but subsequently fell to 79/53, heart rate 100, respirations 15, oxygen saturation 100% on assist control 800 x 16, FIO2 100%, PEEP at 5.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 16.6, hematocrit 29.2, platelet count 365; CHEM7 with a sodium of 143, potassium 4.2, chloride 97, bicarb 24, BUN 35, creatinine 1.1, glucose 176; PT 47.3, PTT 51.6, INR 4.25; urinalysis negative; initial ABG on presentation was pH 7.44, pCO2 34, pO2 78, on 100% FIO2 assist control, PEEP 5.
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia, prolonged PR interval at 0.28, no ST or T-wave changes noted.
Direct laryngoscopy was performed.
A thorough exam of the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, and hypopharynx revealed no masses or lesions.
Additionally the patient failed a swallowing study on the prior admission.
Subsequently sputum cultures grew out MRSA.
On [**10-3**], a repeat chest x-ray showed a persistent left lower lobe infiltrate; however, at that time, the patient was afebrile with a normal white count.
Most likely the etiology was believed to be septic shock secondary to an elevated white count with bands and likely aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was given fluids and packed red blood cells.
On [**9-17**], a chest CT was obtained which showed an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysmal dilatation to a maximum diameter of 5 cm.
During the course of the hospitalization, the patient had several episodes of low blood pressure with a systolic blood pressure down to 70.
Admission electrocardiogram showed no evidence of ischemia.
The patient had an echocardiogram on the last hospitalization day which was on [**2112-9-5**], which showed a normal left ventricular function.
On [**9-25**], the patient's white count was elevated to 19.8, and the patient was started on a 14-day course of Levaquin 500 mg q.24.
A head CT was also obtained to evaluate the sinuses.
The results of that study showed no intracranial hemorrhage, evolution of a left hemisphere stroke and extensive sinus disease.
ENT saw the head CT and recommended getting paranasal sinus CT which was done on [**9-26**].
The results of that study showed chronic paranasal sinus disease with significant opacification of the left maxillary sinus suggestive of obstruction to the left ostial meatal complex.
An ultrasound was obtained on that day which showed no right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Over the course of the hospitalization, the patient's white count subsequently returned to [**Location 213**] limits.
The patient's creatinine was stable throughout the course of the hospitalization.
An abdominal x-ray was obtained which showed a small left effusion.
Endocrine:  On admission the patient had a Cortrosyn test which was within normal limits.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Atorvastatin 20 mg q.d., Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Ipratropium 2 puffs q.6, Lansoprazole 15 mg q.d., Levothyroxine 500 mg q.d., Solu-Medrol 2 puffs b.i.d., Thioridazine 50 mg t.i.d.
