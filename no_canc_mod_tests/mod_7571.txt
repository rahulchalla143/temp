**FINAL REPORT [**2163-3-23**]**     VIRAL CULTURE (Final [**2163-3-23**]):       HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS TYPE 1.
DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2163-3-19**]):       Negative for Influenza A viral antigen.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2163-3-19**]):       NEGATIVE FOR INFLUENZA B VIRAL ANTIGEN.
Studies: -------- CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2163-3-29**] 4:44 PM FINDINGS: Three axial series were obtained through the paranasal sinuses, two of which are significantly degraded by motion artifact.
Compared to the non-contrast head CT, [**2163-3-21**], there has been interval increase in fluid within the bilateral middle ear cavities as well as worsening of opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2163-3-28**] 9:00 AM SINGLE SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 9:20 A.M.: Again seen are a right central venous catheter terminating at the cavo-atrial junction, and a post-pyloric nasogastric tube.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT  [**2163-3-24**] 5:24 PM FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and pulsed wave Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed on the right subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins.
TTE ([**3-22**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-3-7**], left ventricular function appears more vigorous.
Resting heart rate is now faster.
KNEE (2 VIEWS) RIGHT PORT  [**2163-3-21**] 2:28 PM FINDINGS: Two views show no evidence of joint effusion.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2163-3-21**] 7:09 PM FINDINGS: No evidence of acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus or evidence of major territorial infarction.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2163-3-21**] 7:10 PM CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Bibasilar opacities are present with associated small pleural effusions.
Evaluation of the upper abdomen is limited given streak artifact from arms within the field of view.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a mild amount of ascites within the pelvis.
This region is considerably degraded by streak artifact and further evaluation is recommended in 3 months time.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -76 BY SAME PHYSICIAN [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Supine portable AP chest radiograph is obtained.
The lungs are unchanged from prior study with stable multifocal pulmonary consolidation again noted.
The patient's hematocrit stabilized after a total of 9 unitd pRBCS.
Patient also had head CT on arrival secondary to mental status change.
Respiratory work-up was unrevealing though there was evidence of a a possible right lower lobe infiltrate, however, his primary pathology seemed to involve peripheral paranchyma suggestive of a possible interstitial lung disease.
He does have a history of work in a shipyard and the CT was noted to be consist with asbestosis in the past.
Hct finally went to 30, no e/o hemodynamic instability.
Guaiac negative from golytely BM, reported coffee grounds in NG lavage performed in ED, bile currently present when OG suctioned, EGD on [**3-21**] showed clean upper GI tract without evidence of bleeding.
Colonosocpy not perfromed with guaiac negative schools and intubated.
After transfer to the floor, hematocrit remained stable, and thigh size improved with ACE wraps.
Respiratory viral screen positive for HSV 1, but felt to be an oral contaminant.
CXR and prior CT seem consistent with underlying interstitial ling disease, making reserve lower.
Initial thought was to allow a course of antibiotics (at least one week more) and then re-assess.
