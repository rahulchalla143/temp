CT CERVICAL SPINE:  The cervical spine CT demonstrate no fracture or subluxation.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK: CT angiography of the neck demonstrates no evidence of vascular injury or dissection.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD: CT angiography of the head and skull base demonstrate no evidence of vascular injury or dissection.
Head CT demonstrates longitudinal fracture of the right temporal bone extending to the carotid canal and right side of the sphenoid sinus with a blood fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrate no evidence of vascular injury in the neck.
CT angiography of the head demonstrate no evidence of vascular injury in relation with the right carotid artery.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
The head Ct was consistent with significant interval decrease in size and density of the left subdural hematoma and extensive longitudinal fracture of the right temporal bone, involving that middle ear cavity and carotid canal, and exiting at the right sphenoid air cell.
Seizure prophylaxis was intitated with a dilantin load and Dilantin 100mg TID was started.
The neurological exam was intact but there was a possible csf leak noted from the right ear.
The patient's neurological exam continued to be intact and the patient was transfered to the floor.
Neurology was consulted and recommended a urine analysis which was negative, urine toxicity screen which was positive for opiates and barbituates,chest xray,LFTs which were within normal limits,routine EEG as an outpatient with outpatient follow-up with Epilepsy Dept.
