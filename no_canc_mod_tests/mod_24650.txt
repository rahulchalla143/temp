CT chest showed low levels of interstitial fibrotic changes.
End of [**Name (NI) 205**], pt had a pan CT to r/o malignancy, which showed a suspicious pancreatic mass.
End of [**Name (NI) 216**], pt had a EGD and colonoscopy that were negative, and then a EUS which showed a normal pancreas.
2 days ago, pt saw her pulmonologist who reports desaturation to the mid 80's on exertion, sent home on oxygen, but recalled to the hospital after chest CT showed significant worsened interstitial infiltrates bilaterally.
Sent to [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation of hypoxia.

Chest CT showed interstitial disease c/w PCP.
She became increasingly difficult to oxygenate (requiring FiO2s of 65-80% to get O2sats in the high 80s-low 90s) and a repeat CT chest was done which showed worsening of her interstitial disease.
An esophageal balloon was placed which showed that a PEEP of 14 would be optimal for her.
She improved c paralysis c oxygen saturations returning to the high 80s to low 90s.
Pneumomediastinum likely [**1-20**] PCP bleb popping medially in the setting of high PEEP, the possibility of esophageal rupture after balloon placement was considered, however, pt did not acutely decompensate as would be expected in someone c mediastinitis.
Had been on steroids for worsening sob and ct scan from osh concerning for mild ILD.
Myositis autoantibodies were sent but are still pending.
Hepatitis B and C serologies were sent since hepatitis can reactivate in the setting of high dose steroids.
Urine lytes were sent which were c/w SIADH.
