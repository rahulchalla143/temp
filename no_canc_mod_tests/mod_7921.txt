[**2105-5-12**]: Transthoracic Echo: Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-1-13**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is slightly lower.
[**2105-5-14**]: CT C-Spine without contrast IMPRESSION: Moderately severe DJD.
Recommend further evaluation with CT of the chest.
[**2105-5-21**] Chest X-Ray IMPRESSION: 1.
Apparent elevation of right hemidiaphragm, probably due to subpulmonic right effusion, but right lateral decubitus chest radiograph may be considered for confirmation if warranted clinically.
[**2105-5-23**] CHEST PA AND LATERAL Pacer/ICD device has been placed with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, and no pneumothorax.
Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and a moderate-sized right pleural effusion appears slightly larger.

Blood culture [**2105-5-10**]: No growth final  Brief Hospital Course: # Ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest: Patient was without spontaneous circulation for approximately 10 minutes, possibly longer.
Electrolytes, CK, lactate, coagulation studies, and serial arterial blood gases were monitored while he was cooled.
During this time he was asymptomatic and his blood pressure remained stable.
Three days after starting amiodarone, it was noted that his liver function tests (AST, ALT, LDH and total bilirubin) had markedly increased; this was felt to be secondary to initiation of amiodarone, so it was discontinued.
His liver function tests trended downward immediately after cessation of the amiodarone.
Based on his presentation, low ejection fraction, and event noted on telemetry, decision was made to place a defibrillator (ICD) to protect against any further events.
ICD placement was deferred until the patient's renal function demonstrated improvement, and was ultimately placed on [**2105-5-22**].
A chest x-ray at that time revealed RUL/RML collapse secondary to mucous plugging which likely caused the acute hypoxic event, which was responsive to suction.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage (Vancomycin and Zosyn) given concerns over possible pneumonia based on imaging studies and hypotension.
His hypoxia resolved and patient was successfully extubated.
He completed a course of antibiotic treatment for pneumonia, with sputum cultures ultimately demonstrating stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
He had no further respiratory complaints and continued to have a normal oxygen saturation on room air.
His cardiac enzymes were followed and remained flat (peak 0.10 troponin, CK 175).
His EKGs were consistent with his prior EKGs, without any findings concerning for acute ischemia.
His statin was also re-started, however this was held due to the increase his liver function tests.
* His statin can likely be re-started at his outpatient follow-up visit with his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cardiologist, provided that his liver function tests have returned to baseline.
He was given vitamin K for an increasing INR while undergoing cooling protocol.
* He will need an INR/PT/PTT check on Tuesday, [**5-26**], to follow his INR (followed by his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
His home medication of metoprolol was re-started and his blood pressure was at goal at time of discharge.
He was instructed to contact his physician if he became symptomatic prior to reporting to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] for his appointment on [**6-25**] for renal followup; his VNA was also his oxygen saturation decreased below 93%.
He will need continued titration of his regimen on an outpatient basis.
His creatinine was initially at baseline during his first few days, however his creatinine then began to rise while he concurrently became oliguric.
His creatinine peaked at 5.5, and was trending downward at time of discharge.
A renal ultrasound was unremarkable.
* Patient will need basic electrolyte panel, including BUN and creatinine, checked on Tuesday [**5-26**], to be followed by his outpatient nephrologist.
His hematocrit remained stable during his stay, ranging mainly in the 24-26 range.
