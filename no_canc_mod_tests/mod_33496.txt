TTE [**2-8**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
No prior echo for comparison.
CT Head [**2-11**]: There is no evidence of mass, mass effect or large acute territorial infarct, however, acute/subacute ischemic changes cannot be completely excluded, MRI is recommended if clinically warranted.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2-12**]: 1.
CXR [**2-14**]: Left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation is persistent.
Initially on coumadin, which was held when his INR became elevated to 7.
Once INR dropped, he was anticoagulated with heparin gtt.
His heparin was held on [**2-12**], when a retroperitoneal bleed was identified on CT Abdomen and pelvis ordered because of concern for obstruction (there was no evidence of obstruction on CT).
His anticoagulation was still on hold at the time he was transferred out of the ICU.
Retroperitoneal bleed: Found on imaging done for concern of possible obstruction.
Hct responded appropriately to transfusion and was stable thereafter in Hct 32-34 range.
CNS CT imaging was negative for acute changes.
Over the days following his extubation, his myoclonal jerking decreased and his alertness improved to the point of saying a few words.
EEG was consistent with widespread encephalopathy; there was no evidence of epileptiform activity.
Geriatrics team was consulted and they suggested repeat CT of head to understand whether pt's delerium would ever improve.
CT of head showed no stroke.
He will need regular weight checks and consideration of diuresis if any significant increase in weight.
Recommend follow-up echocardiogram in approximately 1-2 months to reassess his LVEF.
He will need a repeat swallow evaluation in the near future as his mental status improves to reasses.
