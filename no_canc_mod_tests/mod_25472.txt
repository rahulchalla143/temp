On [**10-6**] she had a TEE to rule out for clot and evaluate aortic stenosis.
Chest tubes and Epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day two and chest x-ray after removal showed small right apical pneumothorax.
On post-op day three she required blood transfusion since she had a hematocrit of 23.5.
