Imaging [**2126-5-7**] Transthoracic Echo The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
Study unable to adequately assess diastolic LV function in the setting of what appears to be atrial fibrillation.
[**2126-5-4**] CT Head IMPRESSION: 1.
In case of clinical concern for acute infarction, an MRI can be obtained if not contra-indicated.
[**2126-5-4**] Chest Xray IMPRESSION: 1.
Please note that a left hilar mass cannot be excluded and a CT chest with IV contrast can be otained for further evaluation.
[**2126-5-4**] Chest CT IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2126-5-5**] Chest Xray Moderate volume of left pleural effusion persist after large volume left thoracentesis.
Left lower lobe remains collapsed and the lower lobe bronchus is airless, although it should be noted that intervening chest CT showed no mass or endobronchial obstruction.
Labs on discharge:  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 85375**] is an 87 year old woman with hearing impairment, atrial fibrillation, and large left sided pleural effusion.
Her U/A looked positive initially, but urine cultures had no growth.
Blood cultures have remained no growth to date.
Pulmonary infection thought the most likely process given possible consolidation/collapsed lung on CT scan.
Altered mental status: CT of the head showed no clear evidence of hemorrhage.
Thoracentesis performed on [**2126-5-5**] and revealed transudative effusion consistent with CHF.
BNP was elevated at 3405 (unknown baseline).
An echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction.
Given concern for her mental status her Digoxin was discontinued and her beta-blocker was up titrated.
Her heart rates ranged from 55-80 while on the medicine floor.
