NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient's neurological examination improved slightly to the point that his eyes were open and he appeared to be awake, although he did not track visual stimuli including examiner's faces.
As a result of the appearance of the MRI which showed bilateral watershed infarcts, there was some suspicion for potential endocarditis causing multiple embolic events.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed no vegetations consistent with endocarditis.
Given the history of the positive blood cultures, this was felt necessary to rule this out and after the TEE was done this was felt not likely to be the diagnosis.
These infarcts are presumed to be from an episode of hypotension during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course in which his systolic blood pressures dipped down to 70.
The patient had cardiac enzymes done to rule out myocardial ischemia as being the cause for atrial flutter and these did not suggest any myocardial ischemia.
He was eventually switched over to simplify the regimen to just labetalol and Enalapril and probably could increase the doses of those medications should his blood pressure not stay well controlled under systolic blood pressure of 160 or less.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was placed on Lasix standing 20 mg b.i.d.
However, it was noticed that his BUN to creatinine ratio was rising on the order of 30 or above.
His transaminases have continued to come down and on the day before discharge the patient's LFTs came down to ALT 107, AST 50, alkaline phosphatase 82, and total bilirubin 0.3.
In part, this is probably likely due to anemia of chronic disease; however, iron studies are still pending at this time.
