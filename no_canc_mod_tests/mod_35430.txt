# Hypotension- Per the patient, her baseline systolic pressure is in the 80s-90s.
A dopper U/S of the abdomen showed sluggish flow in the portal system.
Renal ultrasound was normal and urine eos were negative but had persistent peripheral eosinophilia.
Her creatinine returned to baseline in roughly 7 days.
EGD showed non-bleeding esophageal varices.
A colonoscopy showed bleeding hemorroids, but they were unable to intervene upon them.
Her Hct was stable.
Cultures were ordered and [**2-9**] were positive for coag neg staph.
Nothing pathologic was identified.
There did not appear to be any lesions identified by palpation of the pylorus and prepyloric area.
She has some abdominal pain when the tube feeds were cut to 14 hour cycle and the time was lengthened and volume decreased to evaluate her tolerance, however by time of discharge she returned to continuous tube feeds and was changed to a renal formula due to hyperkalemia The drain behind the liver continued with very high ascitic fluid output, 2-3 Liters daily.
The output was replaced initially, and then nearing time of discharge, fluid boluses were given several days in a row as her creatinine rose to 1.4 from a nadir of 1.0.
PT evaluation found her to be safe for home with home PT and assistive devices which are being sent home with her.
Her liver function tests improved daily, and her weight stabilized, although she still had a small amount of peripheral edema and some ascites.
