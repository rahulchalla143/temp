The patient was also febrile, pan cultures were negative, though CXR revealed LLL basilar opacity (unchanged).
A repeat methylene blue test was positive.
His pain was well controlled on an epidural of bupivicaine and clonidine, which was discontinued on [**9-13**].
He did continue to have temperatures at night to 101.6 but his blood and urine culture workup was negative.
His CXR continued to show a LLL basilar opacity.
ECG, cardiac enzymes, blood and urine cultures were negative; CXR unchanged.
A repeat methylene blue test was negative for a leak.
The day's events were noteable for starting G tube feeds and discontinuing the epidural.
Exploratory Laparotomy revealing persistent leak and intraabdominal abscess:  Intraoperatively the patient had gross pus (>400cc) oozing from his abdomen, primarily from the left upper quadrant.
Following drainage of the abscess, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted to perform an intraoperative endoscopy, which revealed a retrocolic gastric leak via bubble test.
Intraoperative swab cultures grew 4+ PMNs, 2+ GPCs in pairs and clusters, and 2+ GNR,with cultures showing Hafnia alvei resistant to Unasyn, intermediate to Zosyn, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
His urine output remained profused throughout.
A repeat RLE ultrasound on [**9-27**] revealed interval resolution of the thrombus.
Persistent Leak:  On [**9-26**] the patient underwent a repeat methylene blue test that revealed leakage into the peritoneum.
On [**2179-10-6**] CT Scan performed.
On [**2179-10-12**] Upper Gi study done showing leak at GJ site.
