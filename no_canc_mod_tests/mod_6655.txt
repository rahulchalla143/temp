They also started a hep gtt for both NSTEMI as well as presumed PE given hypoxia, clear CXR and elevated cardiac markers without ST/TW changes on ECG.

ECHO [**2200-1-7**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed with mid to apical hypokinesis (LVEF= ?40 %).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2198-2-9**], left ventricular sysotlic function is probably similar to slightly better but views are suboptimal for comparison.
FINDINGS: A video oropharyngeal swallow study was conducted in conjunction with the speech language pathologist.
Patient diuresed well to IV Lasix on the first day of admission and CXR showed no signs of an aspiration pneumomia.
A speech and swallow evaluation showed that he is at high chronic risk for aspiration, especially thin liquids.
ECG notable for prior infact, though no acute change.
His aspirin, lasix, and beta blocker were discontinued once the decision was made for CMO.

Your blood tests showed that you had a mild heart attack and you were medically managed for 2 days with a blood thinner called heparin.
