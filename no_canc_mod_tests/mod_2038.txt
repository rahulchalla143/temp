This EKG indicates that sinus rate is lower than junctional escape rate, and AVN conduction is normal.
TTE [**2-15**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-8-7**], the bradycardia is more profound and the estimated PA systolic pressure is higher.
CXR [**2-15**]: FINDINGS: AP portable view of the chest obtained.
There is no definite change from prior study with grossly clear lungs bilaterally.
CXR [**2-17**]: IMPRESSION: Recommend repeat chest radiograph in four hours to determine stability of new left deep sulcus which raises possibility of pneumothorax post ICD placement.
Presentation ECG was consistent with sick sinus syndrome with normal AV conduction (see admission EKG description in the Results section).
On admission to CCU, temp wire was placed after 2u FFP was given for INR of 2.6.
Her symptoms of dizziness, malaise and nausea resolved after the temp pacing wire was put in.
The next morning, her INR was 2.0, so she underwent pacemaker placement on [**2-16**].
On admission to CCU, she was volume overloaded on exam with signs of L sided heart failure from aggressive fluid resusitation.
Echo on [**2112-2-15**] showed preserved systolic function.
She was satting well on room air, and her lung exam was clear on discharge.
Basline Cr ~1.0.
# PROPHYLAXIS:  Patient's INR was therapeutic.
