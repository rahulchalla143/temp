[**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **] MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 0.8 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)  Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 0.8 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 3.2 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 50% to 55% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Ascending: 3.4 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aorta - Descending Thoracic: 2.4 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm) Aortic Valve - LVOT Diam: 2.2 cm INTERPRETATION: Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal; RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
