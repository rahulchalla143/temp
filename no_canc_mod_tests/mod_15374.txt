The catheterization showed coronary artery disease with proximal totally occlusion of the left anterior descending artery at first septal and small first diagonal.
An initial large clot was removed proximally with the Angio-Jet.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination on admission revealed temperature 94.5, heart rate was 59, blood pressure was 97/44, respiratory rate was 16, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.
Pulmonary artery, systolic, and diastolic were 53/26.
Pulmonary artery pressure mean was 39.
Cardiac output was 3.2.
Cardiac index was 1.89.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed she was normocephalic.
Carotid pulses were 2+.
Lung examination revealed scattered crackles heard throughout anterolaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Groin examination revealed the right groin with a hematoma.
Extremity examination revealed 1+ bilateral edema and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories of significance from admission revealed white blood cell count was 12.6, hemoglobin was 13, hematocrit was 37.3, and platelets were 218.
Of note, on her complete blood count, her blood urea nitrogen was 33 and her creatinine was 1.4 (which was elevated from her baseline of 1.1).
Her creatine kinase level at [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital were 46 and troponin was less than 0.4.
Her creatine kinase level at 7:55 a.m. was 428 and troponin was 0.58.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Her catheterization on [**7-8**] showed a right-dominant system with an occluded proximal left anterior descending artery with total occlusion at first septal and small first diagonal.
The right heart catheterization revealed severely depressed cardiac index, severely increased right and left filling pressures, and severe pulmonary hypertension.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
The echocardiogram from [**2195-7-8**] revealed an ejection fraction of 25%, a moderately dilated left atrium, and left ventricular cavity size was normal.
Overall, left ventricular ejection fraction and systolic function were severely depressed.
Tricuspid regurgitation of 3+.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit after her cardiac catheterization.
Her cardiac enzymes were followed throughout her stay.
Cardiac enzymes were not checked on the morning of [**7-11**].
Her electrocardiogram had P-R prolongation, right bundle-branch block, and left anterior fascicular block.
On [**7-9**], it was felt that her ACE inhibitor should be discontinued and a small dose of beta blocker should be added to her medication regimen, as it was felt that she was not in third-degree atrioventricular block; however, on [**7-10**], both the ACE inhibitor and beta blocker were discontinued as the patient had systolic blood pressures ranging from the 80s to 90s.
RIGHT GROIN HEMATOMA ISSUES:  The patient had serial hematocrit levels checked.
On the day after admission, her hematocrit dropped to 28 from 33.
Peripheral pulse checks were done every shift, and the patient's hematocrit was kept above 30 throughout her admission.
MAJOR SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  Cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent; ventricular fibrillation arrest, status post cardioversion.
Lasix 40 mg by mouth twice per day (hold for a systolic blood pressure of less than 95).
