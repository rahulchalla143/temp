His sister-in-law reports that he has not missed any doses of medications pre- or post-operatively.
His sister-in-law reports that he has had seizures since age 12 which are due to Wilson's disease.
He has previously had depth electrode placement in 1/98 which EEG monitoring revealed that all of his seizures initiated from the left cingulate gyrus recording area, the more superficial contacts more involved than the deep contacts.
EEG showed spikes and sharp discharges seen focally and independently in the right frontal and central areas much more than in the left central area, and only a few discharges seen in the left temporal region.
EEG [**9-9**] showed 20 pushbutton events of turning to the left which had EEG correlate of a rhythmic sharp activity seen in the right frontal area.
EEG [**9-10**] showed 19 pushbutton events for unresponsiveness and behavioral arrest correlated with sharp rhythmic activity seen in the right frontal area reflected of the central areas and the left frontal area lasting for up to 20-30 seconds.
EEG on [**9-13**] showed 22 pushbutton activations for events for clinical seizures of either turning to the left or the right which were most of the time correlated with rhythmic sharp activity in the right fronto-temporal areas.
MRI head was read as "stable left extraaxial fluid collection", but the team was concerned that his left frontal cyst had slightly enlarged and may have been causing pressure on his parenchyma.
Cultures grew MSSA, and he was discharged on a 14 day course of Ancef and Vancomycin.

Post-op head CT was satisfactory.
He was followed closely by the infectious disease team and his antibiotics were tailored after his wound cultures grew staph aureus that were resistant to oxacillin.
