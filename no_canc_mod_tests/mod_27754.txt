At the OSH [**Name (NI) **], pt had EKG showed ST elevation in inferior lateral leads (II, III, aVF, V5, V6) and corresponding ST depression in V1 V2, right sided ECG not showing ST elevation in V4R.
Pt was started on integrllin, heparin, but was D/C'ed when pt developed acute onset of L sided hemiparesis (arm and leg only), no change in speech or MS, spontaneously resolved after 1-2 hrs, head CT negative.
per daughter, she also had an echo at OSH, ?
At the ED, she was given 5mg IV lopressor, BP dropped to 60's, started with fluid resuscitation 5L [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Intially, chest pain free, T 94.6, BP 98/54, cool mottled skin,likely cardiogenic shock, and started dopamin 5->7.5mg/kg.
pt went to the Cath lab, which showed right dominant, LMCA mild disease, LAD serial 80% stenosis, LCX 50-60% proximal, diffuse 70% OM1, and occluded OM2->stented->0% residual; RCA 90% mid->stented->0% residual.
At the time of the cath, PCW mean 26, PA mean 22, PA (36/23) mean 28, RV (34/22) end 24, HR 75-77, CI 1.76, given equalization of filling pressure across the [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] worrisome for found tamponade, echo was done which showed moderate size pericardial effusion.
Patient underwent a fluoro guided pericardiocentesis with peridcardial pressure of 20mmHg, localized effusion with 150cc of bloody drainage with Hct of 34) worrisome for pericarditis vs localized sealed myocardial rupture.
She was back onto the CCU floor, type and crossed 6 units of blood and off pressors, put on ASA, plavix 75mg x 12 months, echo in 1 hour showed minimal effusion localized to RV (total output ~100cc), keep SBP<110 given likely rupture, hemodynamic monitoring with A-line and PA.

Cardiac Cath ([**2176-8-10**]): 1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant sytem with three vessel coronary artery disease.
dital LCx and OM2 were  occluded.
Hemodynamic assessment showed elevated and equalised RA pressure, RVEDP and PCWP at 23 mm Hg.
Pericardial pressure was 23 mm Hg.
Drainage of 150 cc of bloody pericardial fluid (hct 33) decreased the pericardial pressure to 10 mm Hg.
the blood pressure increased and pulsus resolved.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection and no embolisation.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection or embolisation.
Serial Echo post cath showed stable and progressively decreasing pericardial effusion.

[**Month/Day/Year **]/pericardial effsuion/hypotension - IMI with posterior extension s/p cath (three vessel disease, LAD 80% stenosis not intervened, 50-60% proximal Lcx, 70% OM1, occluded OM2 stented, mid RCA 90% stenotic, stent placed), possible small rupture causing tamponade s/p 150cc bloody pericardial drainage, likely causing cardiogenic shock.
Patient's pressures appear to be equalizing this morning again, with CVP approaching PA diastolic.
Echo on [**8-12**] to measure for effusion will help to evaluate whether the pressure equalizing is due to volume overload or reaccumulation of fluid, which showed 1 cm pericardial effusion: appears stable, more likely due to fluid overload.
pericardial drain pulled on [**8-12**] and repeat echo showed stable pericardial effusion.
We continued monitoring her CVP and PAP which remained stable and her PA catheter was pulled on [**2176-8-14**], we increased her metoprol dose to 12.5mg tid and her captopril to 25mg tid.
On [**2176-8-15**], her A-line was pulled, and her bblock was converted to atenolol 25' and her ACEI was converted to lisinopril 5mg', she was called out to the step down unit, and continued to do well without symptoms of SOB, chest pain, or dizziness.
Her tachycardia resolved after diuresis and increased bblock dosage and her HR has been mainly in the 70-80's since [**8-14**].
CXR relatively clear SOB resolved rapidly with atrovent nebs.
Hyperlipidemia - Her lipid panel showed Triglyc-86 HDL-57 CHOL/HD-2.7 LDLcalc-82; we initially increased her statin from 10->80mg s/p [**Name (NI) **], pt unable to tolerate it, went back to 20mg PO qday which she was able to tolerate.
GERD - on protonix 40mg PO qday.
Prophylaxis - ASA, plavix, SQ heparin, bowel reg prn, PPI .
