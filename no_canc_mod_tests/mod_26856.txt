The patient's ABGs revealed a respiratory alkalosis with a PCO2 of 22-23.
His CXR had improved by [**11-24**], as had his oxygenation.
He received 2 units of PRBC on [**11-19**] after his hct dropped from 44 to 30.
His hematocrit wavered between 30 to 40 thereafter and seemed to be dependent on fluid shifts.
CT of the abdomen on [**11-22**] revealed no retroperitoneal bleed.
On [**11-27**] the pts hct dropped from 35 to 25 with red clots noted in his stool.
Repeat EGD on [**11-28**] revealed massive amounts of blood in the stomach.
