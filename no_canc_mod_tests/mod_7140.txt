Her ROS at [**Location (un) 620**] was notably positive for orthopnea, cough, N/V, dysuria, and negative for chills/fever, abd pain, diarrhea.
CXR was thought to be consistent with CHF.
Her Hct was found to be 22 down from a previous value of 27, with guaiac positive stools, and INR found to be 5.
Hct bumped to 30 after 1 unit PRBCs, and INR decreased to 3.9 after vit K.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
EKG was noted as Vpaced rhythm.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-5-27**], the velocities across the aortic valve have increased slightly.
Patient started on non-rebreather in ED, and on arrival to ICU had O2 sats in mid-high 80s on NRB with 95% FiO2 plus 6L NC.
ABG 7.35/45/61.
Given concern for HCAP (recent hospitalization), blood cultures were sent and patient was started on vanc/cefepime.
Repeat ABG 7.42/36/76.
A TTE performed on [**2171-7-25**] showed worsening aortic stenosis.
Blood culture sent, and patient started on empiric antibiotics with vanc/cefepime to cover potential HCAP, given recent hospitalization.
Urine legionella antigen negative.
Patient remained afebrile, she completed an 8 day course of antibiotics and her SOB resolved.
Patient's Hct bumped following transfusion 1 unit pRBCs at [**Location (un) 620**], though trended down over next day back to 24.
Her last Hct on [**8-4**] was 24.7.
UA not suggestive of UTI, urine culture pending.
Blood cultures sent before intiation of antibiotics on the day of admission.
Her last WBC count was 12.6 on [**8-4**] and her c-diff PCR was negative.
There was no further workup performed as her goals of care shifted towards comfort measures.
She did not have chest pain, and only nonsepcific ST/T changes on EKG which are not significantly changed from prior.
She had a recent cath showing no significant CAD.
It was felt this was likely [**12-20**] demand ischemia and no further workup was performed.
With high suspicion of volume overload in the setting of her additional hypoxia, she was diuresed with several doses of Lasix and her sodium improved to 125 the next morning, which is at her recent baseline.
Her sodium improved to 135 and was 148 on [**8-4**], no further workup was performed given her shift in goals of care.
BUN/Cr ratio was 21, suggesting pre-renal etiology of acute-on-chronic picture in the setting of likely poor forward flow given her AS.
It was also thought her BUN was possibly elevated due to GIB.
No acute interventions were taken for the [**Last Name (un) **] and her creatinine was stable at 2.6 the following day.
It bumped as high as 3.3 during the CCU stay, but came down to 2.9 prior to discharge.
She received vitamin K and FFP with INR coming down to 1.3 on the day following admission.
In the CCU, heparin was started and was continued even when her INR was no longer supra-therapuetic as we did not want to restart warfarin in the setting of possible cardiac catheterization.
Information was obtained from Family/Caregiver.
Creon 12 3 CAP PO TID W/MEALS 8.
