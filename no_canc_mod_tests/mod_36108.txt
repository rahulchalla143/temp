The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2124-10-10**], the degree of LVH has increased.
She was discharged on the decreased amount of lantus as her blood sugars were well controlled and she was instructed to follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **] as lantus may need to be increased again within the next 1-2 weeks.
She had a Head CT on admission that showed no acute bleed.
Her tox screen was negative.
Meningitis was felt to be low probability and her meningitis antibiotics were stopped.
Her Enzymes peaked on peak CK 1379* and peak cTropnT-1.42 on [**3-15**] and trended down.
# Elevated transaminases - During her stay her LFTs were somewhat elevated (though her AP is elevated at baseline), with no clear cause (aside from noting that she is taking statins).
Her urine culture was pending at time of discharge, but her antibiotic course was extended to complete 7 days for UTI.
Please call your primary care physician or seek immediate medical attention if you notice any of the following: chest pain/pressure, palpitations, dizziness, confusion, abdominal pain, weakness, fever, nausea/vomiting, chills, or slurred speech or any other concerning symptoms.
