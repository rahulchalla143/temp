OUTSIDE HOSPITAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 7.7, hematocrit 29.7, platelets 310, sodium 138, INR 1.0, BUN 86, creatinine 2.5, potassium 4.5, glucose 237.
Her CK was 116 with an MB fraction of 5.3 and her troponin was 4.1.
Chest x-ray was consistent with failure.
CURRENT STUDIES IN HOUSE:  Catheterization report, which showed three vessel disease, patent left circumflex stent, cardiac output of 6.60, cardiac index of 3.28, capillary wedge pressure of 34, right atrial pressure of 7 and pulmonary artery pressure 46.
Her right coronary artery showed small nondominant 50% occlusion in the middle vessel and the recommendations status post catheterization were medical management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs when seeing the patient were blood pressure 140/60.
Heart rate 74.
Respiratory rate 20.
Satting 99% on 3 liters.
After return to the floor the patient's creatinine came back down from a high of 4.9 down to approximately 3.
Renal continued to follow the patient and felt that dialysis was not needed at this point, however, they would continue to monitor her urine output as well as creatinine.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization (see report above), but no intervention occurred during the catheterization.
An echocardiogram while in house showed an ejection fraction of 35 to 40%, which was worse from an echocardiogram done two years ago, which showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45%.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient's initial chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.
Prior to the CCU admission the patient was given Lasix and was responsive, however, the day that she was transferred to the CCU her urine output dropped off despite the application of 120 mg of Lasix.
Now that the patient is no longer being dialyzed and is back in the CCU her urine output is once again responsive to Lasix.
Her clinical examination has drastically improved from admission with only very small crackles at the bases remaining.
Chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient's creatinine is slightly up from baseline, however, she continues to have good urine output and his Lasix responding.
Her creatinine appears to be stable and slightly decreasing now at a level near 3.5.
High blood pressure:  The patient was put on her normal blood pressure medications and her blood pressure was controlled adequately throughout her hospital stay.
