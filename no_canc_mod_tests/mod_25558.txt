A recent echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 1096**] suggested that the severity of his aortic stenosis had increased and his left ventricular function had decreased form 55-60% to 45-50%.
In anticipation of surgery, he was referred for a cardiac catheterization which revealed significant three vessel disease.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
LVEF = 45%.
He continued to progress and was transferred to the step down unit on POD#3 for further monitoring.
