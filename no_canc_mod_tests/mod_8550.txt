Admission Date:  [**2131-1-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2131-1-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2060-1-23**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid rate that was refractory to medical therapy, that was ablated and had a pacemaker placed.
She had a slightly low blood pressure of 80/50 and was slightly short of breath with an oxygen saturation of 93% on 2 liters and so was brought to the Emergency Room.
Echocardiogram at an outside hospital per report showed [**Hospital1 **]-atrial dilatation, trace mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 33%.
Her blood pressure was 91/56, heartrate 81, respiratory rate 23 sating 100% on 3 liters of nasal cannula.
On neurological examination her cranial nerves were intact.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission included a white count of 13.3, hematocrit 25.8 down from 33 at [**Hospital3 **] on [**12-26**].
Platelet count was 198.
Baseline BUN and creatinine were 20 and .7 but here was 32 and 2.0, sodium was 128, potassium 4.5, chloride 87 and bicarbonate 23.
Glucose was 239.
Her urinalysis was negative.
Chest x-ray revealed a pacemaker and question of a left retrocardiac density, collapse versus consolidation as well as perhaps mild pulmonary edema.
Her Clostridium difficile was negative times two.
Her creatinine improved with hydration with intravenous fluids back to her baseline.
She had had a number of aspiration events in the past and so a video swallow was obtained which revealed a mild to moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia complicated by reduced bolus control with formation that resulted in aspiration of thin liquids.
Her esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse gastritis and a pulsating extrinsic bulge in the esophagus, suggestive of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.
The cause of her guaiac positive stool was found on colonoscopy which revealed two solitary rectal ulcers with no acute bleeding.
Given that she was on anticoagulation only for atrial fibrillation, they recommended holding anticoagulation until they saw and after the results of the biopsy determine if she needs a repeat endoscopy.
They also recommended a computerized tomographic angiogram of the chest to evaluate for thoracic aortic aneurysm.
She received this examination which revealed no evidence of aortic aneurysm or dissection, although she had diffuse aortic atherosclerotic disease.
The recommendation per Radiology was that further evaluation with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging scan on a nonemergent basis is recommended if clinically warranted.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with exacerbation 2.
Gastroenteritis 6.
Calcium and Vitamin D 10.
Follow up with primary care physician in about one week, you will need an outpatient echocardiogram to further evaluate cardiac function.
You will also need an ultrasound of liver if clinically warranted.
