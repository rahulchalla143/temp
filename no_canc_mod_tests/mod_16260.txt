A urine Cx grew > 100,000 GNR's on [**10-15**].
her Cr was noted to bump from ?1.9 to 2.5 to 3.3, lipase ws 550, amylase 123, Cdiff was negative.
Abdominal U/S showed gallbladder wall thickening, no stones, + [**Doctor Last Name 515**], KUB was negative.
Because of MMP, patient sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
[**Doctor First Name **] was 268 and lipase 539.
After about 1 L of fluid her labs were repeated without improvement and she was therefore admitted to the MICU.
A Ct ABdomen was ordered.

LIMITED EVALUATION OF THE ABDOMEN.
FINDINGS: Limited evaluation of the right upper quadrant and common bile duct was performed.
An ERCP from [**2193**] also demonstrates significant dilatation of the common bile duct.
These findings were seen on the recent CT and common bile duct dilatation was noted on an ERCP from [**2193**].

Chronic cholelithiasis, thickened gallbladder wall, and dilated CBD were seen on ultrasound dated [**10-16**], but no overt cholesytitis on exam dated unchanged from prior studies.
Patient was kept NPO and started on IV fluids, and her enzymes trended down initially.
Her abdominal exam continued to reveal diffuse abdominal tenderness, especially pronounced in the RUQ.
Work-up included repeat RUQ ultrasound, which showed evidence of pericholecystic fluid and acute cholecystitis.
CT Abdomen was without evidence of free air.
UTI Urine culture from rehab grew out Klebsiella resistant to most antibiotics except Imipenem.
Patient recevied 7-day course of Imipenem, and repeat Urine culture was negative for this organism.
A repeat UA grew out yeast, for which foley was changed.
Patient had been started on PO Vanc at OSH, but there was no evidence that her C. Diff was Flagyl-resistant, so patient was re-started on Metronidazole 500mg PO TID on [**10-16**], for 14-day course.
Three C. Diff A toxins were negative as inpatient; C. Diff toxin B assay was sent, results pending.
CHF: CXR on admission demonstrated mild CHF, with increased JVP on exam.
Patient likely has diastolic dysfunction as EF normal on last ECHO in [**7-28**].
Repeat CXR on hospital day 8 showed fluid overload with possible underlying PNA (patient already on Imipenem).
Metronidazole 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): Please d/c if C. Diff B Toxin negative (please call [**Hospital1 18**] to get final result).
Please check electrolytes routinely to watch for re-feeding syndrome.
If you develop shortness of breath, abdominal pain, chest pain, please contact your provider or report to the Emergency Room immediately.
