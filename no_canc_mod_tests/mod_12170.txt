A renal US demonstrated a 2.4 cm L stone without obstruction.
She underwent PCN without operative complications with EBL 300, receiving 2.5 LR.
In the PACU, she was noted to be hypotensive to SBP 90s, and received 1.5L of fluid and neo 100mcg x3, morphine 10mg and a propofol drip.
s/p extubation, she was bagged for 1hr [**3-14**] to apnea, requiring reintubation, [**11-16**] admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.
Cardiac enzymes were noted to be elevated at trop 0.15 and anti TWI were noted in the EKG and she was started on aspirin and a betablocker and cardiology consulted.

Using the anatomy of the left renal collecting system as detailed in a prior CT scan of [**2137-8-16**], and with fluoroscopic guidance, a 21-gauge needle was advanced from a left posterolateral approach into a mid-lower pole calix.
Antegrade nephrostogram demonstrated no hydronephrosis of the left renal collecting system, with contrast tracking around the large stone in the renal pelvis and down into a nondilated left ureter.
[**2137-11-19**] Exercise MIBI: INTERPRETATION: Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tl-201.
Exercise images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 51%.
IMPRESSION: Normal perfusion study with LVEF = 51%.
[**2137-11-19**] Exercise Stress Test: INTERPRETATION: This 57 year old type 2 IDDM woman was referred to the lab for evaluation following a NSTEMI post-operatively on [**2137-11-15**].
EKG also showed TWI in I, aVL, V2-V6.
Her cardiac enzymes trended down thereafter.
An ACEI was held in the setting of an elevated creatinine.
She was also instructed to adhere to appropriate lifestyle modifications, and to have her LFTs checked while on the statin.
Her urine cleared over 48-72hrs.
Her BP remained stable.
A lipid panel was drawn on [**11-19**], which showed an elevated triglyceride level.
Her creatinine fell once her fluid status improved.
On discharge, her Cr was 1.2.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need liver function tests to monitor your statin medication.
