Massage therapist called an ambulance and pt brought to [**Hospital3 **] where CT head showed SAH.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

IMPRESSION: 6 to 7 mm right posterior communicating artery aneurysm with bilobed appearance pointing posteriorly.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain without contrast material.
Subsequently, axial perfusion CT images were obtained during infusion of Omnipaque IV contrast.
Sequentially, rapid axial imaging was performed through the brain during infusion of Omnipaque intravenous contrast.
Images were processed on a separate workstation with display of mean transit time, relative cerebral [**Name2 (NI) **] volume, and relative cerebral [**Name2 (NI) **] flow maps for the CT perfusion study and maximum intensity projection images for the CTA maps.
COMPARISON: CTA of the head from [**2174-2-11**], CT of the head from [**2-5**], [**2173**].
Angiogram of the head from [**2174-2-5**] and CTA of the head from [**2174-2-4**].
FINDINGS:  CT OF THE HEAD: Compared to the prior studies, there is almost complete resolution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage.
CTA OF THE HEAD: Again seen are high-attenuation artifats secondary to coiling of a left PCOM aneurysm.
CT PERFUSION: Mean transit time, cerebral [**Doctor First Name **] volume and cerebral [**Doctor First Name **] flow images are normal.
The CT perfusion maps are normal without evidence of delayed transit time, reduced [**Doctor First Name **] flow or [**Doctor First Name **] volume.
The CTA images of the head demonstrate resolution of the right M1 MCA vasospasm.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage and status post PCom aneurysm coiling, for further evaluation to exclude vasospasm.
TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the head were obtained without contrast.
Following this using departmental protocol, CT angiography of the head was acquired.
Comparison was made with the previous CTA examination of [**2174-2-4**].
Artifacts are seen in this region which limits the evaluation of surrounding vascular structures.
The CT head obtained before contrast demonstrate interval decrease in subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Head CT shows interval decrease in subarachnoid [**Year (4 digits) **].
CT angiography of the head demonstrates interval coiling of the aneurysm.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
A Head CT was done and it was found that she had a SAH.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
On exam at [**Hospital1 18**] she had no neurological deficits and after repeating a scan and obtaining a CTA it was determined she likely had an aneurysm 2 weeks prior and had rebled.
She was admitted and on [**2-5**] she underwent cerebral angiogram for diagostics and was found to have a posterior communicating artery aneurysm which was coiled.
a CT Head was obtained which was stable.
She continued to complain of a slight headache while in the ICU but as of [**2-11**] her exam remained nonfocal.
CTA showed vasospasm in R MCA and ACA, but patient remained nonfocal.
Her [**Date Range **] pressure parameters were increased to 16-200 and she was to remain in the ICU.
Her repeat imaging was without vasospasm.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
You will need a MRI/MRA at that time, 'per [**Doctor Last Name **] Protocol'.
You will need an Angiogram in 3 months  ******* you will need to continue to take Nimodipine for aprox.
