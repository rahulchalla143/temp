Cath there revealed ramus 90%, RCA 95%, 80% PDA, and 3 bare metal stents were placed in the RCA.
Recurrent angina the next day led to a repeat cath and echo showed severe MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] also was shocked 4 times for VTach.

[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.4 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% to 45% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Ascending: *3.6 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aorta - Descending Thoracic: *3.2 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior - hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; lateral apex - hypo; apex - hypo; remaining LV segments contract normally.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
The LV septum, infero-septal and antero-septal walls contract normally.
LV EF = 30-35%.
