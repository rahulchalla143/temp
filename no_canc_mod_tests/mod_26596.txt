RUE examination and CT scan concerning for necrotizing fasciitis.
Intra-op findings and pathology c/w necrotiizing fascitis on debridement.
Blood cultures negative throughout [**Hospital1 18**] stay.
2.RUE necrotizing fasciitis: After initial debridment of RUE performed on [**7-21**] the patient required multiple returns to the OR for exploration + I&D - these were performed on: [**7-22**], [**7-25**], [**7-27**], [**7-28**], [**7-30**], [**8-1**] & [**8-3**].
Hematology oncology was consulted and extensive coagulopathy work-up was performed which lead to the identification of a lupus anticoagulant antibody and widespread PLT dysfunction.
Initially treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin [**Date range (1) 15663**], found to have large left-sided pleural effusion on chest CT that was tapped and fluid samples sent for analysis to r/o empyema.
Chest imaging revealed infiltrate on [**8-14**] and he was started on Daptomycin/Ceftazidime for PNA.
