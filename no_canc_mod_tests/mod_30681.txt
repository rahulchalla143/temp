IMAGING: EKG [**2104-8-25**]: NSR at 72 bpm, nl axis, early R wave progression, Q in III, compared to EKG dated [**2099-12-28**], precordial TWI resolved.
EKG [**2104-9-1**] 11:35 am: NSR at 78, NANI, I and aVL with new 1mm ST depressions; II with new TWF, III and aVF with 0.
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations and new TWF/TWI and deeper Q waves, V2 with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions, diffuse precordial T wave flattening.
EKG [**2104-9-1**] 3:49 pm: NSR with mult PACs, limb lead ST changes resolved, still with inferior TWF/TWI, V2 with 2mm ST depressions, diffuse precordial T wave flattening unchanged.
CT Head [**8-25**]: No ICH or fracture.
CT C Spine [**8-25**]: Study is limited by patient motion.
Grade 1 anterolisthesis at the C3-4 level is likely degenerative but clinical correlation is recommended.
