Following the [**6-16**] thoracentesis, the R pleural effusion was monitored by serial CXR, and was seen to reaccumulate within 5 days, during which time, her 02 demand increased.
Neither tap was suggestive of a frank bleed (see lab results).
A chest CT on [**6-28**] suggested a patent stent with a large, freely-layering right pleural effusion as well as associated compressive atelectasis without evidence of large mass.
On [**7-10**], her CXR was significant for a marked reduction in the right pleural effusion, and she was maintaining an O2 sat of 92% on room air, at rest.
Please follow up INR levels in [**Hospital 1209**] clinic or Primary Care Physician as before.
