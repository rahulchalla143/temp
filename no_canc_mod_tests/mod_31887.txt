The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] images were obtained that demonstrate the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, greater saphenous veins are compressible with wall-to-wall flow and normal response to respiration and augmentation.
A echo showed evidence of right heart strain but he remained hemodynamically stable.
He will have his INR followed at his PCPs office.
