Repeat imaging showed no bleeding or vessel obstruction, therefore no arterial interventions are available.
He did not pass a speech and swallow evaluation and continued to have slurred speech.
On morning of [**1-15**] he developed hypoxia with saturation of 79% on room air.
He was placed on NRB with oxygen saturation of 90-95% on the NRB.
An ABG was drawn with the following numbers 7.44/35/67 and he was subsequently transferred to the MICU.
Upon arrival to the MICU patient was on NRB with oxygen saturation of 95%, RR 40s, increased work of breathing, tachycardic  110-130s.

MRI Head [**1-11**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head [**1-12**] IMPRESSION: Evolution of right pontine infarction.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: [**1-19**] 1.
No PE or aortic dissection although evaluation for subsegmental PE is limited due to motion.
Abd X-ray [**1-19**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of contrast extravasation or free air.
TTE [**1-11**] The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**1-22**] A single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a small-to-moderate left-sided effusion.
Appearance of the heart and lungs is similar to that seen on the chest radiograph obtained 10 hours prior.
Repeat imaging showed no bleeding or vessel obstruction, therefore no arterial interventions were available.
He did not pass a speech and swallow evaluation and continued to have slurred speech.
He did not pass a speech and swallow evaluation and continued to have slurred speech.
On morning of [**1-15**] he developed hypoxia with saturation of 79% on room air.
He was placed on NRB with oxygen saturation of 90-95% on the NRB.
An ABG was drawn with the following numbers 7.44/35/67 and he was subsequently transferred to the MICU.
Upon arrival to the MICU patient was on NRB with oxygen saturation of 95%, RR 40s, increased work of breathing, tachycardic 110-130s.
CXR initially c/w pneumonitis that cleared, however then developed new infiltrate c/w asp pna.
His CXR from [**1-22**] showed small-to-moderate left-sided effusion.
It was incidentally found to traverse through transverse colon and then to enter the stomach on CT obtained to eval pelvis for hematuria on [**1-19**].
He was found to have hematoma in bladder from foley trauma and a cystocopy revealed prostatic trauma.
He as not had any subsequent episodes and his Hct has remained stable.
You received blood transfusions and your blood level remained stable.
A X-ray and CT scan showed that there was no leakage.
