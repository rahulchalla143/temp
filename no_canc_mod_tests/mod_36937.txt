In the ED initial vitals were as follows: T 98.2  HR 83  BP 222/144  RR 22  O2sat 98%RA.
They were unable to obtain a head CT due to agitation so the patient was intubated and sedated with propofol and a head CT was performed; the preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] was negative for bleed.
Chest XR with mild pulmonary edema, EKG with LVH, NSR at 73, no evidence of ACS.
From [**Date range (1) 106065**], she was admitted for Hypertensive urgency (BP 222/107) with no chest pain, EKG unchanged, cardiac enzymes negative, and clear CXR.
BP was 178/82 status post 10 mg IV hydralazine x 3.
She had a mild headache, confusion, agitation, and decreased muscle strength in upper left extremity (CT of head, MRI head, MRA of head and neck were negative).
After getting home dose meds (which consisted of valsartan, amlodipine, and labetolol) her BP came down to 167/78.
(NOTE: [**5-7**] EGD and colonscopy showed internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis of the entire colon.)
She was otherwise hemodynamically stable and also found to have a blood glucose(BG) of 27.
Patient refused MRI and EEG which were recommended by primary team and neurology.
MRI and CT done at the time negative, resolved with home BP meds.

EEG [**2101-11-29**] IMPRESSION: This is a severely abnormal extended routine EEG which shows a resolving electrographic status epilepticus before and after the administration of I.V.
The excessive beta activity described in the second portion of the study is likely secondary to the benzodiazepine.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2101-11-30**] 4:51 PM 1.
Head CT was negative for acute intracranial event.
Exam was normal with exception of + Kernig's sign.
She was transferred to the MICU while intubated overnight, and an LP was done which showed 14 WBCs in the fourth tube with no other signs of infection.
Within less than 48 hours, she no longer opened her eyes to sternal rub, and she was noted to have drooling from her mouth, but an ABG showed good oxygenation and ventilation.
A twenty-minute EEG was done which showed that she was in nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
A second LP was done which showed a WBC of 8 in the fourth tube.
The gram stain and culture for the CSF for both LPs were negative, and HSV PCR was negative, so the acyclovir was stopped.
MRI showed tiny foci of decreased diffusion in the left hemisphere, which could signify acute infarct, but the Neurology team believed the effect on imaging was secondary to the patient having spent over 24 hours in status epilepticus and not necessarily representing an infarct.
CXR was suggestive of PNA, and she had spiked a fever to 101.1F, so she was started on Vanc/Cefepime/Acyclovir/Ampicillin to cover HAP and meningitis.
Her acyclovir was stopped when first LP did not reveal infection.
After her sputum culture grew Moraxella Catarrhalis and pan-sensitive Staph Aureus, the patient was switched to Levofloxacin.
A Keppra level was drawn on the day of discharge, three days after starting it, and will be followed up in [**Hospital 878**] clinic.
The labetalol drip was weaned, and the patient was restarted on her home blood pressure medications, including labetolol 600mg TID, diovan 160mg [**Hospital1 **] (normally 320mg QD), amlodipine 10mg, doxazosin 2mg.
Blood pressures were well controlled on this regimen.
Hypothyroidism: TSH was elevated at 9.0 but was trending down from much higher level of 31 at previous check, so levothyroxine dose was left unchanged at 50mcg daily.
Patient will likely need TSH followup in a few weeks as outpatient to ensure that it continues to trend down.
Clostridium difficile: Patient was noted to have a positive Clostridium difficile toxin test on [**2101-11-26**], so she was started on treatment with metronidazole.
PTH during this hospitalization was 162, which is within the goal range for an end-stage renal patient, per Nephrology team.
A spinal tap was done twice, and the results showed that you did not have a bacterial infection in your spinal fluid, but you may have had a viral infection in your spinal fluid.
You were continued on dialysis three days per week, and your blood pressure was kept under control with your home blood pressure medications.
When your blood pressure becomes too high, you sometimes get confused, and you are at high risk for getting a stroke.
