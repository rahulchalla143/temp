In the ED, vitals were 97.9, HR 74, BP 106/48, 100% on 3LNC.
Her blood pressure fell to 80/32 after receiving lasix 20 IV, but responded to a fluid bolus.

Followup AP and lateral radiographs are recommended for further evaluation.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-8-4**], the gradient across the prosthetic aortic valve has increased and the aortic regurgitation is also increased.
CT Chest.
An echo revealed high pressure gradients across her recently (2 months prior) replaced aortic valve suggesting and malfunctioning valve.
Her INR was therapeutic for A. fib and h/o PE.
She developed worsening shortness of breath, and ABG revealed significant hypercarbia, likely due to tiring, worsening pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
