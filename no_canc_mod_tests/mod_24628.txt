Hydrocephalus, raising the possibility of shunt malfunction, however, prior studies are not available for direct comparison.
Absent septum pellucidum with lack of visualization of the corpus callosum, which may be attenuated or there may be possible agenesis.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2150-5-8**] 9:10 PM PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: A VP shunt catheter is noted coursing along the right neck and right anterior chest, however there are multiple areas of apparent discontinuity within the catheter as it courses within the neck.

Discontinuity of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which is not see above the level of T3.
Followup with CT in one year is recommended.
CT head [**5-11**]: Immediately status post revision of a right frontovertex approach ventriculostomy catheter, with improved lateral ventriculomegaly and no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CT Head [**5-20**] postop:  Satisfactory position of left frontal ventriculostomy catheter, with decreased ventriculomegaly, no new hemorrhage         Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Neurosurgery service after a study revealed a break in her VPS catheter at the level of her neck.
Intraoperatively we found frank Puss coming from her chest wall and the distal portion of the catheter.
The VPS was externalized at the neck and cultures were sent.
Initial cultures revealed GNR in her CSF as well as from wound cultres.
Her EVD was placed at 10cm and was functioning well with ICP'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1131**] [**6-21**] for the first 5 minutes of transduction.
Her CXR from [**5-14**] showed probable bilateral lower lobe pneumonias and ID was consulted and recommended switiching her antibiotics to linezolid and meropenem.
On [**5-18**] CSF was sent in preparation for ensuring clean cultures for the OR for replacement of her shunt later in the week.
The gram stain was negative.
Labs were sent in preparation for internalization of her VP Shunt on  [**5-20**].
She was also having diarrhea so stool cultures were sent that were negative for C. Diff.
Piroxicam 20mg PRN 9.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
