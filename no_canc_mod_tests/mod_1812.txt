Further characterization by MRI is recommended.
[**10-4**] head CT perfusion: CONCLUSION: Old right middle cerebral artery distribution infarction.
The CT perfusion was centered below the middle cerebral artery territory.
The small portion of the inferior left temporal lobe suggests reduced blood volume and blood flow, with no evidence of elevation of the mean transit time.
CT angiography demonstrates patency of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries and their major intracranial branches.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 113 218 90 364/431.14 70 13 107  [**10-5**] head MRI/MRA: Diffusion images demonstrate an acute infarct in the left posterior frontal lobe involving the motor cortex.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2137-10-3**], LV function has decreased, and mitral regurgitation is worse.
Neurological exam significant for aphemia.
He had a chest CT as well given some history obtained of chest pain; this showed no dissection but did show mild pulmonary edema.
Neuro:  MRI showed a new stroke.
His exam improved over the hospital course.
