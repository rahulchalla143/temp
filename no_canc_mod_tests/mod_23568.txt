In case of clinical concern for asbestosis, an HRCT with prone imaging can be obtained on a non-emergent basis as an outpatient following treatment for the acute PE.
Borderline mediastinal lymphadenopathy of uncertain clinical Significance.
An ultrasound can be obtained for further evaluation if clinically warranted.
Despite the PE he was supratherapeutic on admission with INR of 3.3.
Change in INR goal or IVC filter placement was thought not to be necessary given h/o intermittent discontinuation of anticoagulation for various procedures.
If atenolol was cause of bradycardia is is also likely the cause of his hypotension to the SBP of 80s.

We discussed this with your hematologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 83595**], and decided against a groin filter but you should continue with coumadin with goal INR (coumadin level) 2-3.0.
You should have another CAT scan in about 3 months to check the status of the blood clots in your lungs.
