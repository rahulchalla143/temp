Head CT showed occipital hematoma, he was boarded and collared.
Vital on transfer: BP 120s, HR70, O2sat99% on 100%FiO2.
OSH labs: tot bili 0.7, Alkph=48, AST=53, CK=560, MB=11.1, Trop=?, Valproic acid level=41, EtoH<10, neg barbiturate, neg benzo, ne antidepressant, .
Pt hemodynamically stable on telemetry monitoring and continued intubation, sedation, paralytic.
Anterior exam only - some crackles noted on R lung exam.
Studies: ECG Study Date of [**2130-9-2**] Sinus rhythm with first degree atrio-ventricular conduction delay.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 64 [**Telephone/Fax (3) 32880**]/479 24 67 9 .
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2130-9-3**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-2**], the tip of the endotracheal tube is at the upper clavicular level, approximately 6.8 cm above the carina.
Although there is no evidence of obstruction, if there is serious clinical concern for dilated, fluid-filled loops of bowel, CT would be necessary to definitely exclude an obstruction.
ECG Study Date of [**2130-9-4**] Sinus rhythm.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 82 178 92 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 32881**]9 31 .
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2130-9-5**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Recommend further evaluation with CT to evaluate for underlying malignancy.
This was discussed with Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 20069**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32882**] and at the time of approval a contrast enhanced CT had been requested.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2130-9-7**] FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarct, mass, mass effect or edema.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2130-9-7**] FINDINGS: Visualization below C7 is limited by artifact from an endotracheal balloon.
IMPRESSION: Exam limited below C7.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2130-9-7**] FINDINGS: Obstruction of the left main bronchus, approximately 4.2 cm from the carina si by a lesion of low density, approximately 50 Hounsfield units tissue.
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates moderate to significant splenomegaly and otherwise is unremarkable within the limitations of this study that was not designed for evaluation of intra-abdominal pathology.
Evaluation of the patient with bronchoscopy is highly recommended for therapeutic and if necessary diagnostic purposes since the obstruction might be either mucous plug or endobronchial neoplasm (less likely but cannot be entirely excluded).
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2130-9-8**] FINDINGS: Left upper lung veil-like opacity is stable in appearance dating back to [**2130-9-2**] exam.
This finding corresponds to left upper lobe collapse as demonstrated on CT chest of [**2130-9-7**].
Hilar, mediastinal and cardiac silhouettes are stable.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2130-9-9**] FINDINGS: There is an OG tube with the tip in the proximal stomach.
[**Hospital1 32883**] tox screen was within normal limits.
EKG at OSH showed no ST segment elevations; cardiac enzymes were initially elevated CE at OSH (likely secondary to arrest) and trended downward.
ECHO was performed to eval for structural abnormalities which showed small, thick-walled left ventricle, LVEF 70-75%.
Chest Xray suggested left upper lobe collapse, however CT of chest was defered because pt was on CVVH.
Renal status improved and pt was able to come off CVVH for CT of Head, C-spine and Chest.
Head and spine CT showed no fracture or acute intracranial process.
However, Chest CT showed an obstruction of the left main bronchus, approximately 4.2 cm from the carina by a lesion of low density; the left upper lobe was completely collapsed with a low-density material seen in the bronchi (the appearance of "drowned lung").
Therapuetic and diagnostic bronchoscopy was recommended and performed which revealed that the patient had aspirate an insulin cap.
Blood glucose was closely monitored, hypoglycemia was corrected during admission.
Blood cultures came back negative.
His urine output was low, creatinine was increasing, K+ was increasing and he did not have much response to NS boluses.
GU: poor urine output and anatomy restricting use of conventional foley cath.
Urine output gradually improved after CVVH was started.
s/p Fall: Pt found down in field, likely diagnosis hypoglycemia and PEA arrest.
CT head clear at OSH and repeat CT of head in house was negative for acute intracranial process.
CT of C-spine was negative for fracture.
An ammonia level was checked out of concern for depakote side effect and was normal.
He will need a valproic acid level on [**2130-9-19**], goal level is 50-80. .
Haloperidol 5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): please give at 10 pm check ECG for QTc prolongation.
You were found down by emergency medical services without a pulse and with blood sugar of 46.
We required you to stay a few more days in the ICU in order to manage your high blood pressure and blood sugars.
The following changes were made to your home medications: - Your metoprolol was replaced with labatolol for high blood pressures - Lisinopril was increased to 10 mg daily - Your insulin was changed to 53 units of Glargine and a humalog sliding scale.
- Aspirin was increased to 325 mg daily - Divalproex was changed to a long acting dose at 10pm - Oxycontin was decreased to 10 mg daily - Amlodipine was added for blood pressure control - Haldol was added to decrease your confusion at night - Calcium carbonate and Pantopriazole were added to treat heartburn type symptoms.
Please check your blood sugars when you wake up, before lunch, and before bedtime, and keep a journal for your doctor so that s/he can adjust your insulin adequately to prevent future hypoglycemic episodes.
