Most recently, she was referred for a diagnostic catheterization at [**Hospital6 **] on [**2168-5-30**].
Past Medical History: # Primary biliary cirrhosis [**2158-11-8**] by liver biopsy, recent biopsy [**1-25**] w/ minimal findings # Lactose intolerance.
Her last upper endoscopy was done in [**2158**] with findings consistent with celiac sprue.

ECHO ([**2168-6-16**])Pre-Ablation:There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
ECHO ([**2168-6-16**])Post-Ablation:Post ethanol injection into the third septal perforator (2 injections) and the second septal perforator (1 injection), the resting intracavity pressure gradient is 24 mmHg.
Compared to the previous study prior to ethanol injection, the intracavbity gradient is greatly reduced.
Cardiac Cath ([**2168-6-16**]):One vessel coronary artery disease.
Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 20-30 mmHg at rest and > 90 mmHg with valsalva manuever, post-PVC, and dobutamine infusion.
Cardiac Cath [**2168-6-20**]: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 69yo F with CAD (70% mid LAD), HTN, CHF, MMP underwent cardiac catheterization on [**6-16**] for septal ablation to relieve left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The LVOT gradient was 80-90 mmHg on dobutamine infusion prior to ablation and 25 mmHg post ablation, both measured during the procedure (see results section).
Her creatinine was slightly above baseline on admission and she received renal protection prior catheterization with mucomyst and iv fluids with bicarb.
Please note that your white blood cell count was slightly elevated during your hospitalization and your primary care doctor should check this in the future to make sure that it is now back down to normal.
