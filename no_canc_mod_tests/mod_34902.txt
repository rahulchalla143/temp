LVEF 40%.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2126-8-28**] CARDIAC CATH 1.
The LAD revealed a mid 80% lesion after the second marginal.
Resting Hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 15 mmHg and a PCWP of 19.
Systemic arterial pressures were normal on levophed.
Cardiac index was preserved at 3.2L/min/m2.
[**2126-8-30**] CXR The patient was extubated in the meantime interval.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P 73 yo woman with h/o DM, systolic CHF with EF 40%, and HTN who presented with respiratory distress requiring intubation complicated by asystolic cardiac arrest and s/p cath with DES to LAD.
# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: Recent admission for CHF exacerbation.
At this admission, echo showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal and apical hypokinesis; LVEF 40%.
Lung exam and lower extremity peripheral edema was consistent with fluid overload, which improved with diuresis.
# CAD: CPK were elevated to 381 with normal CPK; trop was mildly elevated to 0.05.
Cardiac cath showed a small LAD with 80% occlusion, and a drug-eluting stent was placed.
Her recent colonoscopy was unremarkable, and she is s/p D+C with normal findings per patient's report.
Her LFTs were notable only for mild transaminitis, ALT > AST which may be [**3-16**] to her acute cardiac event and decreased forward flow.
She was noted to have guiac positive stools during this admission but her HCT was stable.
The stool softeners were held and the diarrhea resolved prior to discharge.
However sputum culture was negative.
The increased WBC was thought to be secondary to demarginalization vs. iatrogenic (she is enrolled in study in which she might be given hydrocortisone; note that WBC was 21 at [**Location (un) **]).
Her blood pressure additionally improved after extubation.
# Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure with a Cr of 1.5.
