EKG read at the outside hospital as no acute changes and her CK at the outside hospital was negative.
The patient was started on anticoagulation and her second CK came back at 1100 with positivity for myocardial infarction.
She continued to have chest pain [**3-29**], but her EKG continued to be read as normal.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
Her last stress test was two years ago which was within normal limits per the patient.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation at which time she was on Integrilin drips and Nitrodrip include the following, a temperature of 96.6 F, pulse 103, blood pressure 140/58, breathing 17, saturating at 94% on two liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Cardiovascular:  Chest and heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs at the outside hospital showed an ABG of 7.32, 54 and 102, no ventilator settings or oxygenation information is available.
The first set of labs available from [**Hospital3 **] were on the 15th which showed a CBC with a white blood cell count of 10.7, hematocrit 41.1, platelets 206.
CK of 6, CK MB of 30.
She had a PT of 12.4, PTT of 20.4 and an INR of 1.0.
She had a potassium of 4.1, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6.
Total cholesterol 174, HDL 51, LDL 68, triglycerides 276.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated the following:  Markedly elevated left sided filling pressures and left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, anterolateral apical and distal inferior akinesis, no mitral regurgitation.
Coronary angiography determined the following:  She was right dominant.
Her D1 was 70% occluded and the origin of D2 was 60% occluded.
Left circumflex showed minimal luminal irregularities and proximal stent widely patent.
Her RCA showed a mid RCA stent mildly patent, minimal luminal irregularities throughout.
CBC:  White blood cell count 8.3, hemoglobin 13.7, hematocrit 40.8, platelets 175.
PT 13.3, PTT 71.1 and INR of 1.2.
Her Chemistry 7 was as follows with a sodium of 137, potassium 3.4, chloride 94, bicarbonate 30, BUN 8, creatinine 0.5.
CK was 168.
Her pump function was noted to be roughly 25% left ventricular ejection fraction with akinesis throughout.
Her INR was 1.2.
She is to have her INR checked two days after discharge and indicates that she will do so.
The primary care physician will check for her INR goal which is 2.0 to 3.0.
Her blood sugars remained roughly 150 to 200 throughout her hospital stay.
Congestive heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%.
to be adjusted after two days by primary care physician to goal INR of 2 to 3.
