GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40%).
The [**Location (un) 109**] was 1.0 when the cardiac output was 2.3.
On giving Dobutamine the cardiac output increased to 4.0 and the [**Location (un) 109**] by planimetry and continuity equation was 2.0.
