Past Medical History: ##CAD s/p CABG in [**2093**] with EF 50% by LVG.
LIMA>>LAD, SVG>>Diag -[**9-28**] ETT Thal for 2 minutes with HR 130, 2 mm horizontal lateral ST depressions.
Carotid U/S in [**8-30**] with right ICA occlusion and left 80-99% stenosis.
Pulm: CTA B/L ABD: S/NT/ND Ext: no edema.
Sensation: GI to light touch and pinprick.
cath [**2-2**]: 1.
Limited coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant system with left main and severe native vessel disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central blood pressure of 132/57 mmHg and a left CFA pressure of 101/67 mmHg.
The mean gradient was 3 mmHg.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Cath at OSH [**8-30**]: "multiple tight stenoses of the proximal LAD and proximal D1.
cardiac cath [**2101-1-31**] 1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.
On the left, in the internal carotid artery the peak systolic over diastolic velocity is 361/123.
In the remainder of the vessel the peak systolic velocities are 54, 584 in the CCA, ECA respectively.
