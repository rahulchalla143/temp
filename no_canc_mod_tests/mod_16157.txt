CXR [**2111-6-12**]: ET tube tip is 2.9 cm top of the carina.
The left lateral CP angle was not included on the field.
[**6-12**] CT head: IMPRESSION: 1.
Platelets were reduced by 50% on repeat CBC and hematocrit dropped by 10 points; however, there was no evidence of schistocytes on peripheral smear.
Neurologic exam reported as normal by neurology consult, and non-contrast head CT negative for bleed or obvious seizure focus.
Admission labs were also notable for multiple electrolyte derangements, including ARF, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia.
Urine and serum tox screens were negative.
Prior discharge summary invoked possible h/o alcohol abuse, and serum ethanol level were negative at time of admission, supporting possible delirium tremens, although patient denied EtOH use on both occasions consistently.
Benzo withdrawl was also considered as patient reports taking Lorazapam but urine tox negative.
CSF was unremarkable with negative gram stain.
She was electively intubated at that time and lumbar puncture performed.
CSF gram stain and preliminary culture was negative so the vancomycin and ceftriaxone were not continued.
CSF cytology and HSV PCR were sent and the patient continued on IV acyclovir for empiric treatment of HSV encephalitis.
She was placed on a CIWA scale for possible EtOH withdrawal, but had very low scores.
MRI and EEG were both were unremarkable.
LFTs remained abnormal as well as thyroid function tests which are both further areas of exploration for inciting event for new seizures.
2) Acute Renal Failure: Upon admission, her creatinine was 2.9, with no known h/o renal insufficiency.
She was treated with IVFs as this was felt to be due to possible rhabdomyolysis, and creatinine now improved to 0.9. .
RUQ ultrasound notable only for echogenic fatty liver.
INR of 1.1 supports that synthetic hepatic function is preserved.
Viral hepatitis serologies were checked but were pending at time of discharge.
4) Anemia: Hematocrit dropped 10 points at admission, then stablized.
Iron studies showed as above a very high ferritin and also low B12.
She was started on po B12 supplementation, but will require close monitoring to determine if replacement is adequate.
Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies as well as H. pylori serologies were sent; H. pylori antibody was equivocal and anti-IF antibodies were pending at discharge.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Generalized tonic clonic seizure 2) Hypertension 3) Abnormal thyroid tests 4) hypercholesterolemia 5) Transaminitis   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after having several seizures.
An MRI of your brain was normal.
It is very important that you see your primary care provider and that you see a neurologist after discharge for continued workup to determine the cause of your seizures.
In particular, you will need to have further workup of your liver and thyroid function.
