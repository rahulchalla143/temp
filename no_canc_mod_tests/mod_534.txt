# CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2170-10-19**] 5:04 AM Diffuse air space process, most likely infectious,involving the right upper, middle and lower lobes.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2170-10-19**] 3:30 AM Diffuse patchy opacity involving the entire right lung.
However, CT scan is recommended to further assess.
# CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2170-10-20**] 1:00 PM 1.
# ECG Study Date of [**2170-10-19**]  12:10:46 PM Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
# ECG Study Date of [**2170-10-19**]  12:34:48 PM Sinus tachycardia with occasional atrial premature beats.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2170-10-25**] 1:10 PM AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST: In comparison with films of [**2170-10-19**], the patient has taken a very poor inspiration, which most likely accounts for the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.
Nevertheless, if there is a significant clinical concern, a repeat study with better inspiration and lighter technique would be recommended.
PPD was placed and was negative.
Bronchoscopy was performed to assess lungs and airways, returned no bloody fluid, and found no masses.
Repeat CXR on [**10-25**] demonstrated no PNA.
--PE rule-out: Concern existed for possibe PE, based on elevated DDimer, pleuritic chest pain, and episode of atrial fibrillation which could have been chronic.
Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVT.
Initial CTA chest had poor contrast timing.
CTA was repeated and demonstrated no PE.
CE were negative and EKG demonstrated no ischemic changes.
# Alcohol: Pt had h/o unsuccessful detox, and presented with ethanol level of 291 on urine toxicology.
He has been followed on a CIWA scale since admission given his ongoing alcohol use.
He received 125 mcg of fentanyl and 5 mg midazolam for the bronchoscopy on [**10-24**].
Of note, the patient's creatinine increased from 1.2-2.0 over the last 24 hours.
He was found by the nurse to be somnolent with a RR 8-10, from presumed overdose narcotics.
ABG was 7.29/62/110.
The patient had a room air saturation of 96%, but he would have ongoing intermittent periods of apnea and would desaturate to 88%.
