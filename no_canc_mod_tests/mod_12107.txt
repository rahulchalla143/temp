Admission Date:  [**2199-5-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2199-5-15**]   Service:  MICU  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL COURSE PRIOR TO MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT TRANSFER ON [**2199-5-3**]:  Mr. [**Known lastname 39162**] is an 84-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, status post DDD pacer, hypertension, hypolipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, who was admitted initially on [**2199-4-4**] after an MVC complicated by hypovolemic shock secondary to hemoperitoneum.
He was ultimately extubated on [**4-14**] while still febrile with a sputum growing gram negative rods.
The patient's C spine was unable to be cleared clinically by plain radiograph and CT scan of the cervical spine secondary to this mental status.
On [**4-19**], the patient failed a swallow evaluation and continued tube feeds.
His initial gas peri-intubation was 7.12, 72, 61.
The patient underwent a tracheotomy on [**2199-5-3**] performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**].
The patient remained on continuos trache collar since [**2199-4-5**] with FIO2 set at 0.35 and oxygen saturations greater than 95%.
To maintain his secretions, guaifenesin was added on [**5-8**] and continued.
The patient's chest x-ray on [**5-3**] was consistent with mild congestive heart failure, however, subsequent to chest x-ray's on [**5-4**], [**5-6**], and [**5-8**], demonstrated no significant pulmonary vascular engorgement and clear pulmonary parenchyma.
Suggest referral to Sleep Disorders Center ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 39163**]) when improved, for evaluation and assistence with this.
The patient's mental status improved such that we were able to remove the C spine collar ([**Location (un) 2848**] J) that had been placed upon admission on [**4-4**], plain radiographs of his C spine were obtained on [**4-4**] with CT scan of his C spine on [**4-5**] were negative.
His diuretics were initially held and his renal function returned to baseline with creatinine of 0.9 to 1.1 throughout the remainder of this hospital course.
As his renal function improved, the patient's ACE inhibitor was re-initiated for blood pressure control.
Hypertension:  Mr. [**Known lastname 39164**] antihypertensives were discontinued upon admission and his blood pressures began to rise to systolics in the 180s.
While his creatinine level was elevated, he received several doses of hydralazine.
On these two medications, the patient's blood pressure ranged between 91-140 systolic/35-68 diastolic on the day prior to discharge.
Gastrointestinal/Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  As Mr. [**Known lastname 39164**] mental status had significantly improved, a swish and swallow evaluation was performed on [**5-14**] which he failed.
We recommend a repeat evaluation as his mental status continues to improve and the C spine collar has been removed.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should continue with CBC and Chem-7 three times a week until stable.
He will require a repeat swish and swallow evaluation as his mental status is improving, but should remain NPO until that point.
Recommend patient to have a polysomnogram to evaluate for positive pressure during sweep.
