WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2123-7-15**]): NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary): NO GROWTH    Brief Hospital Course: This is an 86 year-old female recently admitted in mid [**Month (only) **] with septic L shoulder (coag + staph) on vanco via Picc, s/p left shoulder washout and TEE negative for endocarditis.
Admitted from [**Hospital1 756**] after found to have UTI and altered MS and transferred here at request of daughter and found to have L shoulder dislocation, reduced 1 at [**Hospital1 112**] and 2 at [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
She has been blood culture surveillance negative since initial cultures and has been afebrile with declining WBC.
Ortho at [**Hospital1 18**] feels that continued surgical options are limited and recommend sling, with good pain control.
Patient will need further evaluation, most likely at [**Hospital6 **] for further options of management.
CHF with EF 55% with diastolic dysfunction:  Patient with respiratory distress during this admission.
Currently her blood pressure has dropped to 80's/40/s with good response to fluid but she has maintained hemodynamic stability after her GI bleed (see below)  GI bleed with anemia: patient hemodynamcially stable, with stable crits after a brief lower Gi bleed, likely secondary to diverticulosis -guaiac +, black stool, but patient did not want colonoscopy.
Beta-blocker maintained, with occasional holding for low BP's.
She will likely need further eval by orthopoedics, possibly at [**Hospital6 **] for further care of shoulder dislocation.
