Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 11505**] for hypotension after reported fall (unclear etiology, hypotension resolved), as well as altered mental status (presumably related to medications received for her wrist fracture, resolved with Narcan).
In the ED, initial VS were:  T 98.2, HR 100, BP 148/66, RR 28, POx 100% RA.
Labs were notable for WBC 15.4 (85.6% PMNs, no bands), Na 130, bicarb 16, and lactate 5.3.
CXR showed no acute process.
She complained of some mild abdominal discomfort so given her h/o SBO's she underwent CT abdomen that also showed no acute process.
She received Vanc/Zosyn, Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs, Insulin 6U for glucose in the 300's, and Tylenol 1g PO.
After 6L normal saline, repeat lactate was 4.5 so she was admitted to the MICU.

CXR [**2200-6-14**]: Low lung volumes.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/CONTRAST [**2200-6-14**] [preliminary report]: 1.
We held her prednisone for one day and performed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test which showed that she did not appropriately respond.
Later her glipizide was restarted and her blood sugars were relatively well controlled.
She was instructed that she should call her PCP if her blood sugars were high.
She was later restarted on colidine at a lower dose and her lisinopril was switched to losartan as above.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -[**Month (only) 116**] need insulin if blood sugars elevated on steroids and without metformin -Needs to be on long prednisone taper as directed by endocrinology -Blood cultures pending at time of discharge -Would consider outpatient referral to Pulmonary.
