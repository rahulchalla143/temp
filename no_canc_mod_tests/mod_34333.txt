At this time, her BUN was 11 and Cr 1.1.
On [**2-8**], Her BUN was 34 and Cr 2.5 and so her lasix was lowered to 20 mg daily.
Her lasix was ultimately stopped on [**2-13**] when she was found to have a BUN of 43 and Cr of 3.2.
Upon arrival to the ED, her vitals were T 98.1, HR 97, RR 22, 98% on 3LNC (88% on RA), BP 111/79.
Her CXR was difficult to interpret but showed LLL opacity with effusion and she was treated for PNA with Vanco and Cefepime.
Given her elevated LFTs, A RUQ was performed which demonstrated gallstones but could not rule out cholectysitis.
She was seen by surgery who felt her presentation was not consistent with cholectysitis (no abdominal pain, fevers) and therefor did not recommend surgical intervention.
Past Medical History: - Hypothyroidism - Obesity - Iron deficiency anemia - Thoracic aorta aneurysms - H/o gallstones - H/o pancreatic pseudocysts and radiographic evidence of pancreatitis without clinical symptoms (noted [**2125-1-26**]) - Recent LLL CAP with planned Vanco/Zosyn course to end [**2125-2-2**] - H/o renal failure in [**Month (only) **] due to "accidentally taking too much lasix"  Social History: Patient currently residing at rehab facility after hospitalization for PNA.

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2125-2-19**]: IMPRESSION: The constellation of cholelithiasis, peri-pancreatic fluid, and lab evidence of pancreatitis is consistent with gallstone pancreatitis.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS [**2125-2-20**]: 1.
ECHO [**2125-2-21**]: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Left posterior tibial vein showed decreased flow consistent with thrombus.
CT scan performed and noted that her CBD was dilated, question if this is post-obstructive changes.
This fluid was sent for culture though nothing grew.
Cytology on pleural fluid was negative for malignancy.
Abnormal UPEP: Heme-onc performed bone marrow biopsy on [**2125-2-23**].

Ecg was performed, ABG, and she was ruled out for MI, CXR.
Bronchoscopy performed and mucus plugs suctioned.
[**3-8**]: 600cc fluid from thoracentesis, CT with large pseudocyst surrounding liver, IR placed perc drain, returned 1800 cc fluid.
Transient hypotension SBP 80's, MAP < 60, responding to IVF and albumin.
Transfused 1u pRBC for Hct 22.
Repeat CT scan showing loculated pseudocyst collection to liver and increased in size.
Right HD catheter removed secondary to contamination, tip sent and blood sent from site, left subclavian discontinued secondary to erthyema.
Tip sent and blood culture.
Luekocystosis presumed to be secondary to h/o PNA during hospitalization, persistent leukocytosis likely from pancreatic and splenic artery compression, also Positive for MM in UPEP/SPEP with s/p bone marrow biopsy indicative of reactive (not malignant) bone marrow [**3-17**]: Petechial rash on forearms-heparin stopped in AM.
Improving Cr and still making urine.
