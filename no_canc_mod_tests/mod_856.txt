She was taken to the hospital by her husband and by the time she reached [**Name (NI) 8530**] her chest pressure had subsided completely but she did have some abdominal discomfort.

Bibasilar fibrosis that was demonstrated on prior chest CT is largely obscured by this process.
Renal ultrasound could provide additional information or MRI could be obtained in [**3-25**] months.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
TTE showed new left ventricular regional dysfunction c/w interim ischemia/infarction.
Pt does have a history of in-stent restenosis, and she received cath on [**11-8**] (DES -> mid RCA, DES -> distal RCA, DES x2 -> mid LAD, POBA -> mid LCx).
CHF- echo [**2118**] showed EF> 55 percent but exam notable for bilateral crackles, elevated JVP, and lower extremity edema.
Widened mediastinum on xray [**11-3**]: CTA was obtained and aortic dissection was ruled out.
Leukocytosis: on admission to [**Location (un) **], she received stress dose steroids and had a WBC of 44K on admission to [**Hospital1 18**], likely secondary to stress dose of steroids.
The outside hospital noted gall bladder thickening but US done at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-3**] did not show evidence of acute cholecystitis and abdominal exam is benign so evolving cholangitis was unlikely (see below).
# anemia- hct was 30.0 after being transfused 2 units prbcs after admission.
Fe studies were c/w anemia of chronic dz.
