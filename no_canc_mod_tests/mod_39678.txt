Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-5-15**], biventricular systolic function is improved.
The heart rate is also much lower on the current study.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data."
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2155-5-16**] ventricular ectopy is absent and the rate has slowed.
