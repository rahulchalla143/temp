[**2160-6-22**] 06:30AM    ALT 15 AST18  LD220  AlkP 138*  Tbili 0.5   Lipase 26 Trop 0.14     Brief Hospital Course: 79yo female with hx of CABG ([**2153**]), EF 65%, PAF on Coumadin, and DM who was transferred from an OSH with a NSTEMI, found to have bacteremia and Lt hydronephrosis secondary to an impacted stone complicated by acute on chronic renal failure now s/p ureteral stent placement.
On [**6-18**] she underwent a P-Mibi stress test which showed no reversible ischemia.
On Wednesday night ([**6-18**]) she received 2 units FFP, 2 units PRBC in conjuction with decreased UOP and acute renal failure and started looking volume overloaded with crackles b/l on exam and new O2 requirement, and requried 5 L to maintain sats in the low 90's.
On the morning of [**6-19**] she was found to have a junctional rhythm with HRs in the high 40's maintaining her BP.
Since this time she has remained in NSR with HR 60's, except for occasional regular irregularity which was likely caused by runs of premature atrial contractions.
Heparin drip was also held after retroperitoneal bleed but then restarted when her HCT stabalized.
On [**7-4**] her INR reached 2.0 and her heparin drip was stopped.
She will need her INR checked frequently until it stablely ranges between 2.0-3.0. .
#  Bacteremia/ Pyelonephritis - The patient was found to grow pansensitive E. coli [**1-19**] from [**6-12**] BCx(OSH).
Pt had + UTI with WBC of 16 which decreased to 12.
BCx from [**6-14**], [**6-16**], [**6-18**], [**6-19**], and [**6-23**] are no growth/ NGTD.
Her WBC remained elevated in the low to mid 20's throughout most of her stay.
A second attempt took place on [**6-18**] which resulted in a small retroperitoneal bleed with HCT drop.
She was transfused 2 units, heparin drip was held and her HCT were followed closely.
HCT remained stable.
Repeat Ucx revealed proteus resistant to floroquinolones; she was switched to ceftriaxone.
Her WBC dropped from 27 to 15 after stent placement and continued to trend down to 12. .
We followed her electrolytes and volume status and on [**6-19**] consulted nephrology as we anticipated that she might need dialysis.
As her Cr rose to from 3.1 to 3.4 to 4.8 and her urine output droped from 800 to 400 to very little.
She was transferred to the MICU as it was thought she would need dialysis and renal wanted to use CVVHD, however once at the MICU her urine output picked up and her Cr peaked around 5.
From [**6-20**] to [**6-24**] her Cr continued to decrease to 1.8, but then rose to 2.5 on [**6-25**].
Her cr trended down to her baseline of 1.4-1.6. .
After the second percutaneous nephrostomy attempt, the patient developed a retroperitoneal bleed on [**2160-6-18**] with a HCT drop from 31 to 21.9.
The patient was also noted to be hypotensive with SBPs 90s and HR 40s-50s.
A noncontrast CT showed a bleed along her iliopsoas.
Patient was given 3 units of packed red blood cells [**6-19**], and vitamin K 10mg [**5-19**], and 5mg [**5-20**].
The patient's hematocrit responded well and her HCT was 31.4.
Over [**6-26**] to [**6-28**] her Hct slowly declined from to 26.1 and in the setting of chest pain overnight on [**6-27**] she was transfused 2 units PRBC on [**6-28**] and a noncon CT of her abd/pelvis was completed to look for intrabdominal bleeding.
Once her Hct stabilized again her heparin gtt and coumadin were restarted until her INR was therapeutic at 2.0 and then only coumadin was continued.
# Hypernatremia: Peak sodium 154 w/o mental status changes.
Her sodium improved with repletion of free water deficit.
CXR showed no PNA.
Blood Cultures after the initial E.coli from the OSH were all negative.
