TEE:Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium and moderate echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Dense atherosclerotic disease of the heart and aorta with focal infrarenal 2.7-cm dilation  Discharge labs:  wbc 12.4 hgb 10.8 hct 31.8 plt 223  137 105 11 ------------< 104 3.6 26 1.0   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT/PLAN - 76 y/o male with CHF, AS, a fib, NPH s/p VP shunt, p/w hypotension, fever, and elevated troponin, likely urosepsis transferred to MICU then to wards.
Dif positive stools - The patient was admitted to the MICU with septic shock, with urine being the most likely souce although urine cultures only had < 10,000 organisms.
Blood cultures grew enterococcus faecilis in 2 bottles on [**8-30**].
Surveillance cultures were drawn on [**9-1**], 16.
The patient continued to have elevated white counts and with heart murmurs, TEE was done to r/o endocarditis.
The TEE showed small vegetation on aortic valve and patient was so pt has endocarditis.
The patient then developed cough and CXR was done and compared to one on admission, this showed perihilar consolidation and sputum grew out gram neg rods.
Swallow eval done showed that pt was not aspiration risk thereafter.
The patient's white count has fluctuated throughout this admission and on discharge was 12 and trending down.
He was volume repleted and BP has been stable at 80-100s/60s.
Therefore the dose was just increased to 120 mg q8 today and peak and trough levels should be followed before and after the third dose tomorrow [**9-8**].
NSTEMI/troponin leak - Patient with elevated troponin in setting of hypoperfusion from septic shock.
Cardiac enzymes trended down.
Troponin went from .28-->.19-->.09.
A fib - continued digoxin, held coumadin initially since INR was supratherapeutic and resumed when INR was between [**2-25**].
Since INR is 3.3 today, will hold off on coumadin at least tonight and will have recheck before resuming in the next 1-2 days.
Coumadin 3 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: please do not start until after you check INR with goal between [**2-25**].
Please check gentamycin trough 1/2 hour before third dose which should be given at 1 pm on [**9-8**].
