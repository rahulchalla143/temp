Compared with the report of the prior study of [**2161-8-29**], there may be more aortic regurgitation, left ventricular function is unchanged.
Left heart catheterization revealed normal systemic blood pressures.
[**2163-3-1**] CT Chest/abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Correlation with bronchoscopy is suggested to exclude neoplastic mass.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 15225**] is a 42 year old man with HIV/AIDS (CD4 count of 1) status post recent hospitalization for PCP pneumonia, history of multiple opportunistic infections in the past including disseminated MAC, cerebral MAC, chest wall HSV, many PCP pneumonia infections, presented with fevers, chest pain, elevated lactate, hypotension concerning for sepsis but also with EKG changes and positive cardiac enzymes.
Sepsis/infectious disease issues:  As stated above, patient was thought to be septic based on initial presentation, had numerous cultures sent, including checking for opportunistic infections, and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Given his CXR findings throughout hospital course, it was thought that he likely had a pulmonic source of his infection.
Via extensive work up including repeat cultures, CXR, sputum cultures, and pulmonary consultation, it was believed that the likely scenario was that the patient had an endo-bronchial lesion (seen on previous bronchoscopy which biopsy was consistent with PCP) that likely began to bleed with his post-cath anticoagulation, and this bleeding caused is decreased oxygen saturation.
Bronchoscopy was not performed during hospital course as patient was too tenuous to be able to tolerate and he improved without intervention, as stated.
This required a number of blood transfusions to keep his hematocrit [**Last Name (un) 15355**] above 28 given his coronary artery disease.
Work up of this Hct drop included chest/abd/pelvis CT scan to rule out a bleed, as the patient had just undergone cardiac catheterization, and therefore there was concern for retroperitoneal bleed.
Therefore, the likely explanation was that his Hct drop was due to his hemoptysis described above.
His Hct stabilized to low 30's prior to discharge, without requiring further transfusions.
The patient dose have a history of CAD (1VD on cardiac cath in [**2157**], s/p MI in [**2157**] with stent to RCA, thought possibly secondary to his lupus anti-coagulant).
Therefore, the patient was maintained on his outpatient aspirin and plavix, started on metoprolol once his blood pressure tolerated and maintained on a heparin drip.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization during the hospital course with stent re-placed to his RCA.
He had C diff and stool cultures sent off which were negative.
He was discharged with a therapeutic INR, with instructions to have INR monitered and adjust his coumadin dose as instructed.
His Cr remained fairly stable throughout hospital course.
Prednisone taper, was on 20 mg Tablet from [**2-16**] to [**2-26**] 19.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4170**] on Friday, [**2163-3-11**] at 1:30pm - you will need follow up with cardiology as well.
