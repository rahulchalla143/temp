At the time of tranfer the patient's PAP was 40/17, PCWP was 17, CI was 1.7 and PA sat was 49%.
Enzymes from the OSH were notable for CK 1043, MB 123, MB 11.8 and Trop I 45.2.
EKG from the OSH showed T wave inversions and Q waves in V1-V3.
An echo done at the [**Hospital1 **], showed an EF of 15-20%, and depressed left ventricular systolic function.
Cardiac enzymes trended downward and with gentle diuresis patient's cardiac index improved to 3.15. .
An echo revealed no cardiac effusion (s/p day 1 cardiac ablation).
Blood cultures were sent which later came back negative.
An EKG was done which showed no significant changes.
SBP improved to the 120s.
A GI consult was then obtained to rule out the possibility of a stricture.
A barium study was done.
Due to the limitations of the study, GI recommended an outpt eval in 2-3weeks.
A CXR showed bilateral effusions, left lower lobe collapse, consolidation, and mild background of CHF.
Stool cultures later came back positiove for C. diff.
