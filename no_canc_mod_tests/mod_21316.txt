The cardiology team evaluated the patient for assymptomatic, hemodynamically stable bradycardia and agreed to start low dose Metoprolol for blood pressure control in spite of the bradycardia.
As the patient's history reveals three episodes of difficult swallowing in less than 2 weeks prior to the event, a bed-side swallow evaluation was ordered and demonstrated oral/pharyngeal/esophageal dysphagia.
On POD7, a brain MRI was normal, excluding prior CVAs.
A video swallow showed slight tongue weakness and esophageal motility dysfunction with abnormal emptying and tertiary contractions.
The GI consultant/Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended to continue the Protonix treatment and potentially perform an EGD once the surgical wound has healed.
She will be follwe up by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] on [**2197-10-9**] and further GI follow up will be organized then.
