She had h/o PAF and CTH showed large hypodensity on left side on [**1-22**] and repeat head CT showed evolution of infarct with minimal hemorrhage on day of discharge.
Her INRs were difficult to get into therapeutic range but peak INR was 5 days ago at 5.8.
Last INR documented in OSH records is INR 4 on [**2-12**] and Coumadin held again.
Per son, patient's INR was 2 yesterday and she was given small dose Coumadin.
INR now is 1.8.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2170-2-15**] 10:22 AM FINDINGS: Again identified is a hemorrhagic infarction of the left middle cerebral artery territory and associated vasogenic edema.
1) Left MCA hemorrhagic transformation- Likely etiology was supratherapeutic levels of coumadin at outside hospital, reported by son to have [**Name (NI) 62023**] as high as [**5-12**].
CT on admission revealed hematoma measuring approximately 2.9 x 5.3 cm at level of temporal lobe and insula compressing the left lateral vent with 4-5 mm midline shift.
Her examination at presentation was slightly improved from her last examination at time of discharge- this is likely because the hemorrhage was contained within the prior infarct region.
Patient was given 2 units FFP and 1 dose Vit K far and admitted to the neuro ICU for close observation and blood pressure control.
Interval CT scan did not reveal worsening of the hemorrhage or midline shift.
On [**2-22**], because of the concern re persistent aphasia, she had a repeat NCHCT which was unchanged.
Her exam at discharge: global aphasia (mute but mouthing, inconsistently follows basic commands), R facial droop and hemiparesis with RUE plegia and triple flexious response to noxious stim of RLE, R upgoing plantar response, L-sided strength full.
We recommend that she be restarted on her Coumadin 14 days after the hemorrhage which occurred [**2-14**], without Heparin bridge, but this should be done at conservative doses and with frequent INR monitoring.
Metoprolol Tartrate 5 mg/5 mL Solution [**Hospital1 **]: 2.5 mg, repeat x 1 mg Intravenous Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for SBP > 160.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
You should restart your Coumdadin 14 days after this bleeding, with very conservative management and lower dose than previous, and make sure to have your INR monitored frequently.
