Post-gadolinium imaging demonstrates no abnormal enhancement.
MRI [**3-12**] TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained including axial in- and out-of-phase, axial and coronal HASTE, 2D time-of-flight and 3D VIBE pre-, during, and post-gadolinium enhancement with subtractions in each phase.
FINDINGS: Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, unchanged from the prior study.
There is a tiny 7-mm cystic lesion projecting anteriorly through the main pancreatic duct in the body of the pancreas, unchanged from prior studies back to [**2158**].
Bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and splenomegaly, unchanged from prior studies.
CXR [**3-13**] COMPARISON: Chest x-rays [**3-9**] and [**2161-3-11**].
ECHO [**3-13**]  Conclusions: 1.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2161-1-23**], the size of the pericardial effusion has increased.
Echo: [**3-24**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-13**], the effusion appears similar.
Right atrial collapse was also present previously  Echo: [**3-25**] Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-25**], the effusion appears smaller.
Pleural Fluid Cytology and Flow Cytometry FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT  FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING  The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7, and CD antigens 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 19, 20, 23, and 45.
*  Pleural Effusion (presented w/ CP, tachycardia, & SOB)--likely hepatic hydrothorax [**1-22**] to cirrhosis and ascites (requires therapeutic paracentesis every week).
No h/o heart failure (most recent echo in [**1-26**] shows normal LV function), cardiac enzymes negative X 3, Pt is s/p Right-sided thoracentesis on [**3-9**] in which 1.5 L of fluid was taken off--she was repleted with 12 g of albumin following her procedure.
Follow-up CXR showed no significant change in bilateral pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
Pleural specimen results were consistent with an exudative process--LDH effusion/LDH serum is 157/163 which is significantly > 0.6 (Light's Criteria).
However, the serum-albumin gradient is > 1.2 meeting criteria for a transudative process.
Pulmonary was consulted regarding her recurrent pleural effusions--they opine that effusions are likely transudative [**1-22**] to asctes, but would like to r/o malignancy and diastolic heart dysfunction.
Pleural biopsy showed inflammation, but no granulomas, no malignancy was identified.
An Echocardiogram revealed a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse during diastole.
Pulsus paradoxus ranged from [**4-1**] over a few days.
RHC showed low filling pressures (PCWP 11, CVP 7, PAP 22/5).
After fluid resusitation (albumin and rbcs given), pressures were better (PCWP 16, CVP 13, PAP 32/20).
Systolic pressures remained in 80s.
A cardiac MRI was performed and the read was pending on the time of discharge.
Initially, abdominal U/S shows a large amount of ascites--the ascites chemistries are notable for only 5% PMNs arguing against a bacterial infection.
Abdominal/Pelvic MRI showed attenuated patent main and right portal veins, a very thin vessel within the left lobe that may represent a recanalized left portal vein, (however, connection with the main portal vein is not appreciated), an attenuated but patent SMV, and a widely patent splenic vein.
*  h/o bacteremia (Blood Cx Staph Aureus Coag + on [**2160-12-2**])/thigh abcesses (wound cx positive for Strep Milleri on [**2160-12-19**]) [**1-22**] ?endocarditis --Vancomycin was D/C on [**3-13**] as MRI showed interval resolution of the multiple fluid collections within the right thigh as compared to imaging done on [**2161-1-16**].
During admission, had pretransplant evaluation, and right thigh abscess was reassessed, right thigh MRI showed decreased size of abscess, with no fluid collection that was amenable to drainage by radiology.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.
Last LVP at [**Hospital1 18**] was 4.5 L and tolerated OK. Shortness of breath was different from when ascites reaccumulated, chest pain is new, does not feel like her usual GERD pain.
Got pleuroscopy with pleural bx and pleurodesis [**2161-3-20**].
Repeat MRI of thigh showed resolution of thigh abscess and now off abx.
Repeat MRI abd shows patent SMV.
[**Date range (1) 35607**] Pleural biopsy w/o granulomas.
ECHO with mod pericardial effusion.
Still dyspneic, hypoxic, CXR showed persistent pleural effusion.
No further W/U needed, but need aggressive pulm toilet and rehab.
Card: fluid restriction Pulm: W/U for other serositis [**3-30**] ECHO: small pericardial effusion [**3-30**] US: mod ascites [**3-31**] card MRI: pending Plan: Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to discuss further options about liver transplantation, esophageal banding and sbp prophylaxis, since last abdominal ultrasound showed re-accumulating ascites.
