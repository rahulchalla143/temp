[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Conclusions PRE-CPB:1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
