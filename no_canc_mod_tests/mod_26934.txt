Arterial Doppler was performed on both kidneys.
PORTABLE AP CHEST: Heart size is borderline.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION: 1).
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
EKG: [**1-8**] 1.
Sinus rhythm 2.
Sinus rhythm 2.
Since previous tracing of [**2132-1-9**], no significant change   Brief Hospital Course: 58-year old white male was immediately taken to cardiac catheterization with intervention in the LAD, as noted above, transferred to CCU for post-procedure stabilization, and transferred to cardiology floor.
CV: Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**], EKG showed acute st-elevations in the anterior leads, initial troponins were negative.
An echocardiogram showed depressed systolic function with mid and distal anterior and apical akinesis and distal septal hypokinesis.
In the CCU, patient remained in stable condition, with SBPs maintained between 120 and 140 and HR in 70s/80s.
HEME:  Given risk for thrombus formation secondary to wall akinesis, anticoagulation was continued with an INR goal of 1.6 to 2.0.
Patient's coumadin was re-initiated at 4mg qhs, with a discharge INR of 1.3  Patient was given one dose of 80units SC lovenox prior to his discharge and given a prescription for 80 units SC lovenox [**Hospital1 **] until early next week after follow INR checks, which will be addressed by patient's PCP.
Patient was also advised to have a follow-up hematocrit check at the same time of his INR check on [**1-14**].
Patient was noted to intermittently have O2 sats in the mid 90s on room air however.
RENAL: pt's admit Creatinine was 1.5 without evidence per report or in the medical records available as to the source of this elevation.
A renal ultrasound was performed, see results above, which showed no acute abnormality.
On day #2, patient's creatinine dropped to 1.2 and remained at this level until discharge.
Empirically he was initated on vancomycin and levofloxacin, with discontinuation of levofloxacin after a CXR failed to show any signs of pneumonia or infiltrate.
A u/a was negative for infection.
His leukocytosis stabilized and his temperature did not spike but he did have periods of low grade temps.

***Pt has been started on coumadin treatments for his depressed ejection fraction on his echocardiogram secondary to his myocardial infarction.
Goal INR is 1.6-2.0.
On day of discharge, pt's INR was 1.3.
He should also have his hematocrit checked and followed-up by his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] PCP should further [**Name9 (PRE) 8019**] possible sources of GI bleed - if his hematocrit continues to fall by recheck on [**Name (NI) 766**], pt may need to be readmitted for work-up of a GI bleed.
