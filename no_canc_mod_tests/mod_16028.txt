There, a CT scan demonstrated a right temporal occipital contusion with small subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Per report, the patient was awake on transport but with a GCS of seven on arrival at [**Hospital1 69**].
The GCS improved to 14 by the time of the CT scan.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.0; heart rate 70; blood pressure 139/60; respiratory rate 20 prior to intubation.
Pulse oximetry was 100% on three liters nasal cannula.
Chest: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium of 140; potassium of 4.6; chloride of 105; bicarbonate of 22; BUN 23; creatinine 0.7; glucose 138; white count 14.4; hematocrit of 41.3; platelets 224; blood gases 7.46/30/288/22/0.
Amylase 77.
Serum toxicology screen is negative.
Urine has large blood, greater than 50 red cells.
Urine toxicology is negative.
X-rays demonstrate head CT which showed several high attenuation foci in the cortical parenchyma, the right frontal lobe, anterior and bilateral frontal lobes, more posterior along the vertex and along the right parietal cortex as well.
CT of the cervical spine shows irregularity at the end plates at the C5-C6 level which could be degenerative in nature.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no evidence of intra-abdominal solid organ injury.
Thoracic and lumbar spine x-rays show severe compression fracture of T12 at approximately the 60 to 70% muscle height.
A repeat CAT scan on [**2194-2-8**] showed no significant changes from the original CT.  A repeat abdominal CT on [**2194-2-8**] showed no changes.
A magnetic resonance scan of the brain showed a punctate area of elevated signal metal fusion weighted images in the left hypocanthus which read as an acute area of ischemia could be present.
These could represent areas of infarction or sequela of recent trauma.
Magnetic resonance scan of the cervical spine:  The study was limited by patient motion.
The Neurosurgery consult service was asked to see her regarding her subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as the findings on her spine radiographs.
A repeat CAT scan was performed on hospital day number two which was stable from the original CAT scan.
Therefore, both her cervical and thoracic and lumbar spine were all cleared.
A magnetic resonance scan was obtained of her brain which showed a possible area of ischemia in the hypocanthus as well as evidence of traumatic injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The right wrist fracture, the Colles' fracture was reduced and then reduced again on [**2194-2-10**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9694**].
Weight bearing as tolerated on right lower extremity.
