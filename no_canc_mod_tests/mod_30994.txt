The patient was admitted to the outside hospital on [**4-16**] with hematemesis of approximately 100 cc.
The patient had a hematocrit of 21 with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s.
He had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy there which revealed variceal rupture and underwent sclerosis.
The patient was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells with a rise in his hematocrit to 28; which subsequently fell to 26.
Upon arrival, the patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli, had mild tachypnea, and a systolic blood pressure in the 70s to 80s.
A chest x-ray was without pneumothorax or effusions.
The patient was given 3 units of packed red blood cells, a normal saline bolus of 500 cc, and started on a bicarbonate drip for severe acidemia with a blood gas showing a pH of 7.1, a PCO2 of 28, and PO2 of 383.
The patient's systolic blood pressure stabilized around 85 on Levophed/dopamine drip.
Hepatitis B and hepatitis C. 6.
q.d., trazodone, lithium, Ambien, nadolol 20 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature was 97, weight was 75 kg, blood pressure was 106/50 on 10 mcg of dopamine per minute with 5.3 mcg of Levophed, heart rate was 70 to 90, respiratory rate was 10 to 14 (with ventilator settings of AC/700/12X12/100/5, oxygen saturation was 91%.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat showed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
The oropharynx showed poor dentition, mucous membranes were moist.
The neck showed no jugular venous distention.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 21.8, hematocrit was 27.1, platelets were 162, mean cell volume was 90.
Differential revealed 79% neutrophils, 8% bands, 10% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes).
Sodium was 139, potassium was 5.8, chloride was 106, bicarbonate was 6, blood urea nitrogen was 74, creatinine was 2, blood glucose was 128.
PT was 19.6, PTT was 39.5, INR was 2.7.
ALT was 151, AST was 196, alkaline phosphatase was 55, ammonia was 357, total bilirubin was 1.6, albumin was 1.9.
Calcium was 8, phosphorous was 6.7, magnesium was 2.3.
Uric acid was 9.9.
Acidic fluid revealed total protein was 1.2, LDH was 67.
Gram stain revealed 1+ polys, no organisms.
Acidic cultures were pending times two.
White count of acidic fluid showed 126 white blood cells, 547 red blood cells.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed the right internal jugular in good position.
The ETT was 2 cm from the carina.
His hypotension was felt to be multifactorial secondary to both hypovolemia secondary to blood loss as well as sepsis.
His INR improved to 1.7 from 2.7, but an additional 2 units of fresh frozen plasma were given.
His creatinine improved to 1.8 with intravenous fluids.
An abdominal ultrasound was obtained given his elevated amylase and lipase and elevated liver function tests.
This ultrasound showed liver cysts, normal portal flow, and gallstones but no evidence of obstruction.
On hospital day three, the ascites cultures came back with 4/4 bottles positive for gram-negative rods.
His creatinine continued to improve.
His fractional secretion of sodium was greater than 25%; consistent with acute tubular necrosis from his hypotension.
His antibodies were sent given his decreasing platelets.
On hospital day six, the patient's urine culture came back positive for enterococcus.
The patient was hemodynamically stable, and oxygen saturations were within normal limits.
On hospital day nine, the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and banding of his esophageal varices by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**].
His hematocrit was noted to be slowly trending down, but there was initially no evidence of rebleeding.
A STAT hematocrit was sent.
His blood pressure was 94/70 at this time.
Hepatitis B and hepatitis C cirrhosis.
