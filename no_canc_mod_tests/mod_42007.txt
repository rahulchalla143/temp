After less than an hour, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
A CBC and chemistries were pending at the time of transfer.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**], his initial vitals in the ED were: 50, 140/106, 93%, but his BP dropped to 60/30's within 10 minutes of arrival.
A head CT was performed and negative for intracranial processes.
Lumbar puncture was attempted [**Last Name (LF) 112154**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] interventional radiology did a flouro-guided LP.

However, study is somewhat limited due to the orientation of the images.
Comparison with prior studies can be helpful to assess interval change.

IMAGING METHOD:  Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
Following resting images and 20 seconds following intravenous regadenoson, approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously.
Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 68% with an EDV of 87 ml.
A head CT and a head MRI were both done and showed no acute intracranial processes.
The flouro-guided lumbar puncture showed 1 WBC and slightly elevated protein.
A 24 hour electroencephalogram showed global slowing consistant with alpha coma.
In 2 months he should have a repeat MRI to determine whether or not his sellar mass remains stable.
Also EKG showed RBBB and inferolateral ST depression of 1mm in limb leads and 2mm in lateral precordial leads.
His creatinine was trended and decreased during his stay, thus suggesting prerenal failure as the etiology.
Information was obtained from Family/Caregiver.
In the ICU, several diagnostic studies were obtained, including head imaging and a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).
You were monitored with continuous EEG, and there were no concerning findings on this.
Because you initially had some EKG changes, we also performed a nuclear stress study of your heart, which was normal.
Also, a follow-up brain MRI should be obtained in [**1-16**] months to make sure that the changes seen in your brain are stable.
You should have a repeat MRI 2 months after discharge.
