Initial OSH head CT negative.
[**1-16**] MRI head also showed no acute infarcts but evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic disease and volume loss noted.
OSH ED Labs notable for K of 7.8 (unclear if hemolyzed) and he received calcium gluconate, dextrose/insulin and K recovered.
Infectious workup showed negative LP, CXR, and urine.
Neurology team felt that patient's history and exam was most consistent with a post-ictal [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis verus CVA or infection.
Extubated successfully on [**1-20**] and now comfortable at 93% O2 Saturations but continues to have mild cough and fevers.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4640**] was transferred to the neurology service on [**1-20**] and additional workup has been limited from a neurological standpoint with no clear cause for his seizures to date.
[**1-17**] Sputum Culture grew out Moraxella catarrhalis and he has been continued on IV ceftriaxone and Azithromycin (started [**1-18**]) and .
Sensation to light touch in tact.

CXR [**2124-1-26**]: FINDINGS: Retrocardiac opacity has slightly worsened since [**2124-1-24**] and likely reflects left lower lobe collapse.
Partially imaged is mucosal disease in the maxillary sinuses with air-fluid levels and mastoid effusions.
[**2124-1-18**] CT head without contrast: FINDINGS: There is no evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, or hydrocephalus.
Extensive periventricular, deep and subcortical white matter hypodensity is likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic disease, similar to prior.
Underpneumatization of the right mastoid air cells is again seen, likely secondary to prior chronic infections.
Echo [**2124-1-17**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
EEG [**2124-1-17**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable routine EEG due to the presence of a disorganized background composed of generally slow  frequencies.
MRI head with and without contrast [**2124-1-16**]: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct.
The major intracranial vascular flow-voids are maintained (please see the recent CTA for additional details regarding the vessels).
Paranasal sinus and right mastoid fluid-opacification, likely related to intubation, possibly superimposed on pre-existent inflammatory disease.
However, if feasible, an MRI scan may be more sensitive in detecting a so-called ischemic core.
Imaging with head CT/CTA and MRI show no evidence of any bleeds, traumas, new infarcts to blame CVA event for his seizure activity.
EEG done [**1-17**] showed mild diffuse encephalopathy but no focal or epileptiform features.
On [**2123-03-28**] when he had only 2 days of Ceftriaxone treatment left he became tachypnic and his CXR showed a new RLL.
A bed side speech and swallow evaluation was negative for aspiration.
He had a UA on [**1-17**] that grew coag negative staph but repeat UA on [**2124-1-24**] showed no pyuria and his urine cx returned with mixed bacterial flora.
On [**2124-1-17**] he had a single bottle blood cx + for coag negative staph on [**1-17**] that was thought to be a contaminant.
He has multiple days of blood cultures pending since.
This was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia given FENA of 0.9% and contracted labs with elevated BUN.
His Na was 129 on the day of discharge.
His atenolol 25mg was changed to metoprolol and ultimately increased to toprol XL 300mg on [**1-26**].
His HRs were stable in 80s-90s on discharge.
#Anemia: HCT levels have been slowly drifting down over hospital course with drop from 35-> 29-> 26 and then stable after this.
His HCT was 29 on the day of discharge.
He was found to be guaiac + and will need a colonoscopy as an outpatient.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative.
#Diastolic CHF: Most recent TTE on this admission with continued preserved systolic function and EF 55%.

You had a very thorough workup with the neurology service which included MRI imaging of your brain, CT/CTA scans of your head and neck, electrical studies of the brain (EEG), and a lumbar tap of your spine was done to examine cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for any concerning malignancies, meningitis or other infections.
All of these studies were unrevealing for a clear cause of your seizures.
It is important that you discuss the need for a  repeat chest x-ray in a few weeks with your primary care M.D.
MEDICATION INSTRUCTIONS/CHANGES: The following medications were discontinued: -tamsulosin (will likely be restarted at rehab) -atenolol -Hydrochlorothiazide (this should not be restarted in the future given your low sodium) .
