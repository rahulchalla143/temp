The patient had been discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Care Hospital on [**1-2**] where he was noted to have melena for 24 hours with a hematocrit drop from 34 to 28%.
He was transfused two units of packed red blood cells with only some compensation of his hematocrit to 31.6.
He was sent to the Emergency Room on [**2150-1-12**] for evaluation where he was hypotensive to 70/48 and started on IV fluids and Dopamine.
An NG lavage was negative for bright red blood or coffee grounds.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization with LAD stent on [**2149-12-15**], status post myocardial infarction [**11-8**], congestive heart failure with an EF of 25-30%, type 2 diabetes times 20 years, peripheral vascular disease status post toe amputation times two, atrial fibrillation, pseudomonas urinary tract infection [**2149-11-8**], hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, now on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday, gout, chronic lower extremity edema, obstructive sleep apnea on C-PAP, history of MRSA pneumonia, history of GI bleed with no EGD or colonoscopy report available.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.8, heart rate 80, blood pressure 131/51, respiratory rate 26, oxygen saturation 97% on four liters.
HEENT exam indicated pupils are equal, round and reactive to light, there was a right subconjunctival hemorrhage, had dry oral mucosa.
Cardiovascular exam indicated regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
On abdominal exam the patient had bruising on his lower abdomen which was soft, nontender, non distended with normal bowel sounds.
On extremity exam the patient had 2+ peripheral pulses and no edema.
EKG indicated normal sinus rhythm.
Chest x-ray indicated an elevated right hemidiaphragm, unchanged from previous study on [**12-29**].
Remainder of his laboratory studies were notable for a white blood count of 28.4 with differential of 74% neutrophils and 20% lymphocytes, hematocrit 31.6, BUN 69, creatinine 6.1, glucose 188.
Urinalysis indicated specific gravity of greater than 1.030, nitrites positive with 3-5 white blood cells and a few bacteria.
Arterial blood gas indicated a PH of 7.31 with a PCO2 40 and PAO2 of 62.
Lactate level was 2.3.
Blood cultures times two were sent as was a urine culture and a C. diff.
He was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 25.9 on hospital day #2 and was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells on hospital day #3.
The GI service saw the patient on hospital day #2 and felt that he was not actively bleeding since his blood pressure was stable and his blood counts were stable and it was therefore opted for upper and lower endoscopy when his coagulation parameters were optimized.
As all of his cultures were negative antibiotics were discontinued.
Upper endoscopy indicated normal esophagus, stomach and duodenum with the exception of a small polyp in the stomach which was likely hyperplastic.
