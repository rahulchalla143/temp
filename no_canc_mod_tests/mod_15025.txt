Reflexes were decreased in his lower extremities.
The initial presentation was suggestive of a multifocal process felt most likely to be acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.
A lumbar puncture was performed.
The white count was 62, red count 2, 5% polys, 82% lymphs, 13% macrophages.
Protein 69, glucose 58.
His myelin basic protein was weakly positive.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] improved as an outpatient and his main issues were tingling in his fingertips and toes.
The patient was transferred to the Neurology Service at [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation and treatment.
His blood pressure was 116/67, pulse 80, breathing 18, 02 saturation 99% on room air.
Neurologic:  He is awake, alert, and cooperative with examination and a normal affect.
His sensation was intact to light touch and temperature as well as proprioception.

There were 197 white cells, 11 red blood cells, polys 4%, lymphocytes 86%, monocytes 10%, protein 78, glucose 80.
The patient had a repeat MRI of his head and of his spine.
A brain biopsy was considered to determine pathologically what [**Known firstname **] diagnosis is, however, this was deferred as the constellation of clinical findings including the lesion location, the rapid progression, and the response to steroids were all consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.
