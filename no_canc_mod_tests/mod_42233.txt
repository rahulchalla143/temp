Studies: [**2116-10-31**] CXR PA/Lat: 1.
[**2116-10-31**] CT Abd/Pelv: There is no retroperitoneal bleed.
Micro: None  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 56 year old woman with Crohn's disease complicated by rectovaginal fistula and multiple SBOs s/p multiple abdominal surgeries, also with prior SVC surgery now on fondaparinux, who was transferred to ICU from ED for hypotension and HCT drop of 15 in past 4 days likely due to her right upper extremity hematoma.
# Acute blood loss anemia: Patient had 14 point Hct drop over the course of 5 days (38.7 on [**2116-10-26**] to 24.3 on [**2116-10-31**]).
Other possible causes of anemia were considered including retroperitoneal bleed, GI losses, or hemolysis, but there was no evidence of RP bleed on CT, NG lavage and guaiac were negative in the ED, and Tbili was normal.
Her hematocrit remained stable at 12 hours (24.6, up from 24.3) and the arm ecchymosis appeard to be resolving.
She did agree to have her blood drawn the following day as an outpatient and to return to the hospital if she experienced any concerning symptoms.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] evidence of compartment syndrome on exam and she remained neurovascularly intact.
The ecchymosis had spread far beyond the markings drawn by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] hematocrit remained stable (24.3 on admission to 24.6 approx 12 hours later), and the ecchymosis improved while hospitalized.
She declined further lab draws (as above), but agreed to have blood drawn as outpatient within 1-3 days.
Last abdominal surgery was [**2112**] per pt.
KUB showed distended loops and air fluid levels concerning for obstruction, and CT revealed large amount of stool in the colon with no evidence of free air or transition point.
# Hypotension: Patient had isolated blood pressure [**Location (un) 1131**] in the 80s systolic, otherwise remained in the 90s-100s.
Sepsis is unlikely given that she has afebrile without leukocytosis, and her BPs have stabilized and the remainder of her vitals are normal.
# Right apical lung opacity: Patient with RUL opacity on CXR in ED.
CT stability documented and there is no acute change to suggest infection or malignancy.
# Transitional issues: - Patient should have hematocrit checked within 1-3 days of discharge to monitor for stability (last hct 24.6)  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
