CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2171-9-10**] FINDINGS: The previously noted right posterior temporal hemorrhagic contusion with mild surrounding edema is unchanged.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2171-9-10**] FINDINGS: There is no fracture or subluxation.
EEG [**2171-9-12**] FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout most of the record, the background rhythm remained of low voltage and was slow, typically reaching a 5 Hz maximum during wakefulness.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were additional bursts of generalized mixed frequency slowing.
ABNORMALITY #3: There were several brief sharp waves with some following slowing in the right temporal region, maximal at the T4 electrode in the right temporal region.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
Head CT was repeated to evaluate for interval change, and was determined to be stable.
CT C-spine was ordered for clearance.
A1C was 5.5 Carotid US showed bilateral stenosis <50%.
EEG showed widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures but no clear epileptiform activity.
On [**9-12**] his UA was positive and Culture showed mixed flora.
Cipro was started and repeat culture was sent on [**9-15**].
Speech/ swallow evaluation was ordered and a modified diet was recommended.
