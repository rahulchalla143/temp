STUDIES: [**2158-12-15**] - CT HEAD -IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
[**2158-12-15**] - CTA CHEST IMPRESSION: 1.
Evaluation is limited on this non-gated study, but a dedicated cardiac CT could be performed if clinically indicated to further evaluate this region.
Pulmonary artery enlargement, concerning for pulmonary arterial hypertension.
[**2158-12-16**] - ECHOCARDIOGRAM Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to muliple areas of severe hypokinesis and akinesis (see figure), with posterobasal dyskinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Left ventricular contractile function remains profoundly depressed.
If clinically warranted, further evaluation with MR, more sensitive study for osteomyelitis.
[**2158-12-20**] - VENOUS ULTRASOUND (MAP) IMPRESSION: Patent right greater saphenous and bilateral lesser saphenous veins with reasonable diameters for bypass.
CPR initiated, had BP and pulse by the time EMS arrived.
Confused in ED, CT scan of the head was unrevealing.
A foot xray was consistent with osteomyelitis.
Non-invasive arterial studies were obtained to evaluate the blood flow to his LE prior to an debridement.
Echocardiogram was preformed during this admission.
# Renal Function - The patient's creatinine began to rise during this admission most which was felt to be secondary to vancomycin toxicity.
His creatinine improved after the vancomycin was discontinued.

Outpatient Lab Work Please have a CBC checked on Monday [**2159-1-1**].
The antibiotic you are taking for your foot infection, linezolid, can cause your white blood cell count to be low.
You will need weekly blood draws while you are on it to check your cell count.
You will need to have your blood drawn on Monday [**12-25**] to have your renal function checked.
