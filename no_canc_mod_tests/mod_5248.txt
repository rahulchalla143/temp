A computed tomography of the abdomen confirmed a kidney stone in the left ureter with hydronephrosis.
The patient was evaluated by Urology and sent to the [**Hospital **] Care Center for emergent ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy with stent placement.
His oxygen saturation on room air at that time was 80%.
The patient's vital signs at that time showed a heart rate in the 80s and an oxygen saturation of 98% on 70% oxygen.
A chest x-ray was obtained, and the Intensive Care Unit team was called.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed the patient's temperature was 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 80 to 100, his blood pressure was 110 to 120/50 to 70, his respiratory rate was 18 to 22, and his oxygen saturation was 78% on 70% face mask.
General examination revealed the patient was pleasant sitting in a chair with a continuous nebulizer.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   His chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.
Of note, the patient received Decadron 8 mg in the operating room for unclear reasons which may have blunted any reaction he had, as with our examination he had no evidence of respiratory distress; although, he did have evidence of hypoxia by his oxygen saturations.
Once the patient reached the Intensive Care Unit, he was able to maintain his oxygen saturations above 95% without supplemental oxygen support.
He had a slight elevation in his white blood cell count but was not treated for any aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was instructed to have a repeat chest x-ray in one month.
