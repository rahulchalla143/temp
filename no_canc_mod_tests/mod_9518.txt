1) Upper GI Bleed: Patient was admitted on aspirin and plavix, and per EGD found to have an ulcer that had a vessel which was cauterized.
His hematocrit was followed, and he was transfused red cells to maintain his a hematocrit above 28.
At discharge his hematocrit was stable, and his hemodynamics were stable as well.
Per GI, he should have his ASA and plavix held for life, but with his history of CAD restarting ASA 81mg can be considered at 1 week post discharge, and restarting plavix not only for status post CABG but for carotid stenosis, can be decided by his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Other work-up was pursued, and he did not exhibit signs of arrythmia on telemetry, was ruled out for an MI, and his ECHO lacked significant valvular pathology.
