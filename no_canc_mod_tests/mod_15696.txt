In the Emergency Room, the patient had a chest x-ray, which was consistent with new congestive heart failure.
Sarcoidosis diagnosed by skin biopsy in [**2160-5-1**].
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Patient was afebrile, blood pressure 124/88, pulse 120, respirations 18, and saturating 96% on 2 liters.
Dorsalis pedis were 2+.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White count 10.3, hematocrit 46.8, platelets 295.
Chem-7:  Sodium 140, potassium 4.9, bicarb 20, BUN 23, creatinine 1.0.
Chest x-ray revealed congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions, upper lobe volume loss consistent with adenopathy.
CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolus.
EKG was sinus tachycardia at 120, left anterior fascicular block, flat T waves laterally in V5 and V6 and poor R-wave progression.
The patient had an echocardiogram on [**3-13**], which revealed an ejection fraction of [**10-16**]%, dilation of the atria and ventricles as well as global LV hypokinesis and 2+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiac catheterization to assess for evidence of ischemia as an etiology for his congestive heart failure.
Cardiac catheterization on [**3-16**] showed no flow-limiting disease.
He had a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 36, LVEDP of 40, and cardiac index of 1.4.
Patient was diuresed in the CCU until his wedge pressure came down appropriately, and then he was transferred back to the floor.
The patient had a myocardial biopsy at the time of his cardiac catheterization, which did not reveal sarcoid.
The patient had an ACE level of 48, which was normal.
Further workup also included viral serologies, CMV IgM which was equivocal, CMV IgG which was positive, EBV IgG positive, and IgM was negative.
Patient had an abdominal ultrasound which was normal.
As an outpatient, the patient will follow up for gallium thallium scan for further assessment of possible sarcoid as the underlying etiology of his congestive heart failure.
He had a cardiac catheterization, which revealed no flow-limiting disease.
He was monitored on telemetry and found to have evidence of second-degree heart block.
The patient was started on an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker, and the patient's blood pressure remained under good control.
The ground-glass opacities on CT are likely due to his congestive heart failure.
His goal INR is 2-2.5.
He will follow up with his primary care physician for further monitoring of his Coumadin dosing.
The patient will discuss referral for a sleep study to evaluate for possible obstructive-sleep apnea.
In addition to this, he will have his INR checked for further adjustment of his Coumadin dose.
