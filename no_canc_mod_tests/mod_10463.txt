At the outside hospital, an EKG showed anterolateral wall ST elevations and the patient was started on Retivase with no significant changes in his EKG.
At that time, a stat echocardiogram showed anterior wall hypokinesis and the patient was emergently transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for emergent PCI.
His hemodynamics showed a right atrial pressure of 28, right ventricle of 118/21, pulmonary artery 116/33, wedge of 31, cardiac index of 1.3, cardiac output of 2.6, SVR 1,692, PVR 92.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed which increased his cardiac index to 2.2.
LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:  White count of 23.3, hematocrit 51.5, platelet count 295,000.
His Chem-10 showed a sodium of 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 100, bicarbonate 27, BUN 9, creatinine 1.3, glucose 135.
His initial troponin was 33.2.
His EKG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 104.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 100.6, blood pressure 107/78, heart rate 108 beats per minute, saturating at 100% on mechanical ventilation.
His peak CK was 3,236.
His peak CK MB was 201.
His peak index was 7.1.
His peak troponin was greater than 50.
An echocardiogram revealed a left atrium that was normal in size, left ventricular wall thickness that was normal.
Overall, LV systolic function was severely depressed with an ejection fraction of 20-25%.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus could not be excluded.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities including akinesis of the apex, mid and distal anterior and anterolateral walls along with a midinferior wall, right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal.
A fasting lipid panel was drawn.
It showed an HDL of 50, LDL of 40.
His sputum yielded H. influenzae and the patient completed a course of antibiotics.
ALCOHOL:  The patient had a significant history of alcohol use and he was started on a CIWA scale and given Valium as needed for a score greater than 10 on the CIWA scale.
