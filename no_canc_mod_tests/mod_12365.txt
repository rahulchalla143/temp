Apparently, the patient was going to be discharged to rehabilitation on the day of admission to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**4-3**], when the patient became lethargic and had a temperature to 103.8.
She was transferred to [**Hospital6 2910**] briefly, where her initial blood pressure was in the 90s.
The patient was very lethargic there and ABG showed a blood gas with pH of 7.39, carbon dioxide 39.6, and oxygen 79.
Chest x-ray showed a right left lower lobe infiltrate.
Upon arrival to the emergency room, the vital signs were blood pressure 148/56; heart rate 80; temperature 98.6; respiratory rate 16; oxygen saturation 98% on four liters.
Repeat ABG there showed a pH of 7.35, pO2 149, pCO2 40, on four liters by nasal cannula.
The patient, on initial labs, was seen to have a hematocrit of 25, decreased from 30, two days previously.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient denied headache, back pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, hematemesis, melena, or bright red blood per rectum.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, temperature was 98.0, blood pressure 117/38, heart rate 76, respirations 14, oxygen saturation 98% on four liters by nasal cannula.
BACK:  Diffuse thoracic and lumbar spine tenderness.
RECTAL:  Examination revealed guaiac negative with brown stool.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following: White count 5.5, hematocrit 25.5, platelet count 257,000.
Chem 7 remarkable for creatinine of 2.2, magnesium 1.1, AST 81, ALT 23, alkaline phosphatase 119, albumin 2.1, INR 1.6, PTT 40.8, D-dimer greater than 1.0.
Urinalysis:  Positive nitrites, 3+ blood, no leukocyte esterase, 2 to 5 red blood cells, 5 to 10 white blood cells, no bacteria.
Urine cultures were negative from [**4-4**] to [**4-11**] and then positive for Pseudomonas greater than 100,000 from urine cultures [**4-16**] and [**4-18**].
Stool cultures were negative for C. difficile times four.
Tissue culture from the L2-L3 disk on [**4-15**], showed no growth.
Tissue culture L2-L3 bone on [**4-15**] grew MRSA.
CSF from the lumbar puncture on [**4-10**] was negative.
Radiology:  Multiple chest x-rays done between [**4-4**] and [**4-20**], initially showed a right lower lobe atelectasis and left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia, which improved over time and chronic mild CHF.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**4-4**], showed no retroperitoneal bleed and atelectasis of bilateral lungs.
Repeat abdominal CT on [**4-22**] showed no evidence of intraabdominal abscess, thickened wall of the sigmoid consistent with circular muscle hypertrophy.
MRI of the spine on [**4-8**], showed diskitis and osteomyelitis of T4-T5 and T11-T12 and L2-L3.
On [**4-8**], MR of the head showed old ischemic disease in the brain stem with a tiny lesion present advanced periventricular microvascular ischemic changes, left-sided mastoiditis of uncertain age and generalized atrophy.
On [**4-19**], repeat MR of the spine and head showed no change from the initial studies.
Echocardiogram on [**4-10**], transesophageal echocardiogram showed no thrombus; no atrial septal defect; mild LVH with LV function ejection fraction greater than 55%, normal RV with mild aortic regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation and significant pulmonary regurgitation.
Transesophageal echocardiogram done [**4-10**] showed a probable mitral valve perforation consistent with endocarditis, no vegetations seen.
The patient had a lumbar puncture on the 8th.
CSF from this puncture was culture negative and had no organisms on gram stain, 1+ PMN.
Culture of the abscess subsequently grew enterococcus.
Urine culture subcutaneously grew Pseudomonas and the patient was started on Tobramycin on [**4-20**] for a seven-day course.
Stool was sent for C. difficile as the patient briefly developed some diarrhea.
Urine was sent for urinalysis and culture.
Urinalysis was consistent with a UTI with nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and white blood cells with many bacteria.
The culture was pending at the time of this dictation.
Because the patient is already on Linezolid and Tobramycin, we will followup culture results and treat accordingly.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was done [**4-9**] and Transesophageal echocardiogram was done on [**4-10**], which showed probable endocarditis involving the mitral valve.
She was started on Lopressor and Hydralazine during her hospital stay to control her blood pressure.
She had no further pulmonary issues and she had good oxygen saturations on room air.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient is anemic with hematocrit stable, but running in the low 20s throughout the hospital course.
She had two CT scans, which showed that she did not have any retroperitoneal bleed.
It is most likely that she had suppression due to her infection, which will recover as the patient clinically improves.
She did not have any evidence for meningitis by lumbar puncture and intracranial abscess or hemorrhage was ruled out by head MRI.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  This patient was started on TPN on [**2171-4-11**] and on tube feeds [**4-18**].
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had a small bowel obstruction at the outside hospital and had a laparotomy and lysis of adhesions there.
She had slightly worsened abdominal pain [**4-20**] to [**4-22**], but repeat abdominal CT on [**4-22**] showed no intra-abdominal pathology.
This was sent for C. difficile times four, which was negative.
hold for systolic blood pressure less than 100.
