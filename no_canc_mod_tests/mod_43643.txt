[**Name (NI) **] presents for evaluation of his expanding neck mass.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination in the Emergency [**Hospital1 **] revealed vital signs of temperature of 103.9, heart rate 108, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 156/60.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Neck examination revealed a warm mass posterior to the left ear about 20 cm X 8 cm long.
Pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds throughout.
Coronary examination was tachycardic, normal first heart sound and second heart sound.
Extremity examination revealed 2+ peripheral pulses.
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Admission laboratories were white blood cell count 19.1, hemoglobin 12.7, hematocrit 35.7, platelets 215.
Sodium 131, potassium 4.6, chloride 92, bicarbonate 23, blood urea nitrogen 10, creatinine 0.9.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   CT scan of the neck revealed a splenius capitus myositis and cellulitis overlying with fluid tracking between plains.
Infectious Disease was consulted for further evaluation of the patient's neck mass, and the consultants recommended the addition of vancomycin, clindamycin, and to continue Unasyn which the patient had been started on.
Blood cultures ultimately returned growing coagulase-positive Staphylococcus.
A chest CT examination was checked to examine for extension into the mediastinum, and this was negative.
Serial neck CT examinations revealed increase in edema, fat stranding, and possible abscess formation.
On [**2197-8-31**], routine laboratories revealed that the patient's hematocrit had been declining, and his white blood cell count had been increasing.
That day the patient suffered an episode of hypotension to a systolic blood pressure in the 90s, and he was tachycardic.
He was given large volume intravenous fluids and transfusions of packed red blood cells to restore blood volume and blood pressure.
White blood cell count continued to rise.
The patient was seen in consultation by the Cardiology Service to evaluate for his atrial flutter and to receive a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out endocarditis.
Transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis.
White blood cell count continued to increase.
The patient's urine also was noted to become rust colored, and his liver function tests began to rise.
A repeat CT scan was suspicious for persistent pus in the neck.
On [**2197-9-3**], the possibility of meningitis was entertained, and a lumbar puncture was attempted to rule out meningitis.
The patient was again taken to the operating room and an incision an drainage was performed, and a drainage of prevertebral collection of fluid was drained as well.
The patient continued to require pressors as necessary to maintain blood pressure.
Lumbar puncture was again attempted, and this was again unsuccessful.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy to remove mucous plugs felt to be contributing to the patient's increasing oxygen requirements.
A repeat CT scan revealed a possible persistent neck abscess and possible lower lung collapse, possibly consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
A repeat bronchoscopy was performed and some mucous plugs were obtained.
The patient's urine output declined, and the possibility of acute tubular necrosis secondary to rhabdomyolysis or sepsis was entertained.
CVVHD was recommended and undertaken.
An autopsy was performed, per the family's request.
