During cardiac catheterization, she clotted off her left circumflex artery and left anterior descending artery.
Emergent bedside echo showed no evidence of tamponade.She was successfully resuscitated using CPS with emergent deployment of drug eluting stents in LAD and LCx(Kissing stenting of the LMCA into the LAD and LCX ).Patient had resumption of pulsatile central aortic pressure after stenting of the LAD and LCx.
An IABP was placed.PA cath c/w ischemic MR.  She has massive blood loss during the procedure and has recieved 5U PRBC and 1u platelet prior to transfer to CCU.
Echo post cath showed small pericardial effusion, mild aymmetric LVH, nl LV size, mildly depressed LVEF  Patient did well in cath lab and ECMO weaned off.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is mild to moderately depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed with apical akinesis.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Initial resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided filling pressures.
Left ventriculography revealed normal systolic function.
The first cineangiogram showed mild LMCA plaquing with abrupt cutoff and total occlusion of the LCx.
Emergent bedside echo showed no evidence of tamponade.
Limited angiography of the RCA showed minimal CAD.
Successful kissing stenting of the LAD/LCX back to the ostium of the LMCA was performed with a 3.0 x 33 mm Cypher DES (LAD) and LCX 2.5 x 28 mm Cypher DES (LCX).
PA catheterization was performed via the LFV.
Repeat emergent echo showed a small pericardial space, posterobasal hypokinesis and a hyperdynamic anterior wall with moderate mitral regurgitation.
Vascular surgery consulted (together with CT surgery) regarding weaning of CPS and removal of CPS catheter  CT abdomen and pelvis [**2127-3-25**]:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar collapse/consolidation.
The adrenal glands, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, and intraabdominal loops of bowel are unchanged.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is diffuse stranding in the subcutaneous tissues in the left groin with obliteration of the normal fat planes with asymmetry with expansion of the anterior thigh musculature consistent with a hematoma.
Echo [**2127-3-28**]: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is modertately depressed.

Her blood pressure dropped drastically requiring a brief period of pressure support with levophed, which was quickly weaned off.
Echo was performed on [**2127-3-28**] with the concern of posterior wall aneurysm seen by ECG changes.
Her blood pressure control is satisfactory with metoprolol, lisinopril and imdur.
She was transfused to keep her hematocrit above 30.
Her hematocrit remained stable thereafter.
Vancomycin was discontinued since sputum culture did not grow any organism.
