The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction and had a troponin peak of 15.4, but CKMB was within normal limits and cardiology reviewed the electrocardiogram concluding that it was not an myocardial infarction.
Lumbar puncture was negative.
Liver function tests were found to be negative with AST equalling 359, ALT equaling 258.
The patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, but became hypoxic and hypoventilated during the procedure.
The patient was also found to be anemic with a hematocrit of 25.6 and so received 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
The patient was found on chest x-ray to have pneumonia.
Blood cultures came back positive for Enterobacter cloacae that was Levaquin sensitivity, so Ampicillin and Flagyl were discontinued.
The decision was made to then hold off repeating the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for at least another month to allow the patient to recover and compensate and then to arrange an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography as an outpatient.
The plan, therefore is to discharge the patient to a rehab facility and follow up endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in about a month.

holding for systolic blood pressures of less then 100.
Enoxaparin 50 mg subQ q 12 hours until INR is 12.5.
