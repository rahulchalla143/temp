Pain began in the setting of practical exam for surgical technician training.
EKG showed STE in III>II and aVF, STD in I and aVL.
Cath showed right-dominant system with 90% blockage in mid LCx and 40% blockage in mid RCA.
He had continued diaphoresis, mild chest pain, but repeat EKG no changes suggestive of ichemia.

CK peaked at 4733, MBI 8.8, trop 14.98 on [**2-7**].
RLE cyanosis observed after catheterization was reduced after removal of venous sheath and did not recur during inpatient course; right sided LENIs revealed no evidence of DVT and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not show evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
The patient transiently complained of chest pain following the procedure; the CP was not associated with EKG changes suggestive of ischemia.
Pump:  Echcardiogram on [**2126-2-8**] was significant for impaired systolic function, with EF 30-35%.
Cyanosis s/p cath  As mentioned above, the RLE cyanosis post-cath#1 was considered to be due to venous insufficiency.
The patient had brisk DP pulses during the cyanotic episode and throughout the hospital course.
