An echocardiogram on [**9-23**] showed worsening aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.7cm2, a bicuspid aortic valve, a peak gradient of 91mmHg, a mean gradiant of 60mmHg and an ejection fraction of 55%.
She underwent a cardiac catheterization today in preparation of her aortic valve surgery which showed normal coronary arteries and severe aortic stenosis.

Normal ventricular function  [**2101-1-19**] EKG Sinus rhythm, rate 66.
