PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On physical examination, vital signs were stable with a temperature of 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 92/38, his respiratory rate was 22, and his oxygen saturation was 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Significant laboratory data revealed the patient's platelet count was 42 (which was stable during his hospitalization).
His mean cell volume was 101.
His INR was 1.7, prothrombin time was 15.9, and partial thromboplastin time was 29.9.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An echocardiogram from [**11-2**] showed an ejection fraction of 60% to 70%.
Mitral regurgitation of 2+ and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
On [**11-3**], a right upper quadrant ultrasound showed an echogenic liver consistent with cirrhosis and a hyperechoic lesion in the posterior right lobe.
A chest x-ray from [**11-12**] showed a patchy retrocardiac density and a slight increase in atelectasis.
On [**11-11**], an upper extremity ultrasound showed a chronic occlusion of right internal jugular with collateralization.
He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and mucous plugging.
A chest x-ray on [**11-16**] showed interval improvement of the left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with clear lung fields.
Thyroid studies were sent here which showed a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone and a free T4.
His C4 level was within normal limits, and his C1 level was an out of hospital study which was still pending.
GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS SEPSIS ISSUES:  The patient was to complete a 21-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone as per Infectious Disease consultation.
All surveillance cultures have been negative thus far.
After the patient has completed his course of antibiotics, he should have surveillance cultures drawn as an outpatient.
PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient is now in a sinus rhythm; although, it appears that he is at high risk for having recurrent atrial fibrillation given that his left atrium was enlarged on an echocardiogram done at this institution.
From an ultrasound done on [**11-15**], there was no reversal of flow noted.
It was unclear at this time whether the patient has had an evaluation for varies; however, this should be done as an outpatient.
