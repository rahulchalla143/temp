CXR - IMPRESSION: Marked improvement of previously identified congestive pattern and parenchymal infiltrates in this elderly patient.
Comparison with the study of [**2106-7-7**] demonstrates now also improvement of the initially seen fluffy infiltrates on the right base.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to involutional change.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain without intracranial hemorrhage  Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2106-7-9**]  6:48:26 PM   Atrial fibrillation.

Repeat radiography following diuresis may be indicated to assess for underlying infection.
Strict aspiration precautions were maintained and the patient was assisted with all meals.
Repeat CXR revealed improved pneumonia.
Congestive heart failure - diastolic, pulmonary edema - from aggressive IVF and rapid A fib.
Warfarin was held during the hospital stay and the INR at most times was between [**2-13**] (from drug  interaction with levofloxacin).
The warfarin should be started 1 day after stopping levofloxacin and close monitoring of INR should be done.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid rate - as above  h/o CVA - warfarin as above.
TSH was normal.
