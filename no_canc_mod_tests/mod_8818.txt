Neurologic work-up for stroke back then included an echocardiogram on [**8-30**] showing EF of 45-50%, aortic sclerosis, trace aortic insufficiency, trace tricuspid regurgitation.
MRA and MRI showed moderate global atrophy with diffuse extensive small vessel disease.
Based on the study results, differential diagnosis was made to include small vessel disease vs vasculitis.
An LP was recommended.
This was reported to be a moderately traumatic tap with only one out of four tubes sent where there were 110 red blood cells, 30 monocytes, no polys with a glucose of 69, protein 167.
Gram stain was negative and culture showed question of coag negative staph aureus which was thought to be a contaminant.
Based on this result the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for positive angiography and biopsy for work-up of possible CNS vasculitis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission blood pressure 140/80.
Cardiovascular exam showed regular rate and rhythm.
On cranial nerve exam pupils were equal and reactive.
On motor exam there is increased tone in the lower extremities.
On upper extremity exam there is questionable deltoid weakness on the left, otherwise full strength on the left upper extremity.
Reflexes were brisk and toes were upgoing.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission RPR negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, ESR 20, platelet count 115,000, cholesterol 186, triglycerides 173, LDL 123, Lyme titers were negative.
A lumbar puncture was repeated to verify the abnormal [**Location (un) 1131**] in the CSF.
On repeat lumbar puncture the patient still was found to have an elevated protein of 133 in his cerebrospinal fluid.
Cerebral angiogram showed narrowing of the P1 segment in his posterior circulation which was uncommon for atherosclerotic disease.
Based on these results, the patient underwent diagnostic brain biopsy of the right frontal region on [**2182-9-12**].
Results of the brain biopsy were consistent with a microangiopathic vasculitis.
The patient was loaded on Dilantin and CT of head was immediately obtained to evaluate intracranial status and ruled out any postoperative bleeding.
CT head was normal.
EKG obtained also suggested the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy with ST changes that are chronic.
The patient will require weekly CBC to monitor his white blood cell count while on Cytoxan therapy.
