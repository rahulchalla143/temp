Neurosurgery evaluated the SAH with serial head CTs which showed stable SAH and used Dilantin for prophylaxis.
After running several test to further evaluate his dementia, the consensus among teams was that his changes in mental status were due to his SAH on top of his underlying dementia, the patient's mental status failed to improve and a speech and swallow eval revealed that he was unable to protect his airway with POs.
