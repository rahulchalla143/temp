NYHA Class: III  CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2122-7-23**].
ECHOCARDIOGRAM  TTE (Complete) Done [**2123-3-10**] at 11:00:00 Echocardiographic Measurements   Findings LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined with certainty or precision (due to the absence of a reliable tricuspid regurgitation Doppler spectrum) but appears to be at least moderately elevated.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-9-4**], the calculated aortic valve orifice area is reduced.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Rest of the examination is unchanged.
TTE [**2123-5-3**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-4-28**], the findings are similar.
