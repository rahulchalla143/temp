The most recent MRI on [**2150-7-20**] showed a left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia     with a moderate amount of liver and a large fluid-filled     loop of bowel.
Sinus fetal bradycardia with an echocardiogram on [**7-20**], showing trivial mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid     regurgitation, mild aortic arch hypoplasia, a left aortic     arch, and secondary dextrocardia.
Sinus bradycardia with a heart rate     of 95 to 100 was noted and appeared to be     atrioventricular synchrony.
Fetal brain MRI normal and without hydrocephalus.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 37079**] was placed, and 30 mL of bilious fluid were removed.
The infant was warmed, dried, and transported to the NICU on 100% FIO2 with saturations of 91%.
Apgars were 4 at 1 minute and 7 at 5 minutes.
A surgical team from [**Hospital3 1810**] was present in the delivery room.
to 100.3, unknown Group B Strep, and rupture of membranes on [**2150-7-30**] at 2230, the mother did receive intrapartum antibiotics.
Initial blood pressure was low, and the infant received 1 normal saline bolus.
ADMISSION/DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight 1475 g (25th to 50th percentile); length 40.5 cm (also 25th to 50th percentile); head circumference 29 cm (25th to 50th percentile); pre- and postductal sats.
89% and 90% on 100% FIO2, status post surfactant; initial blood pressure 52/17 with a mean of 27 and a repeat of 64/25 with a mean of 36.
Chest x-ray showed some evidence of lung tissue in the     lung tissue in the left upper lobe.
The infant was placed on high frequency     oscillation ventilation with a MAP of 12 and a Hertz of     25.
The first gas was venous with a pH of 7.16, CO2     of 81, and PO2 of 43 with a base excess of -2.
Repeat venous gas after this     change showed a pH of 7.33, CO2 of 47, and base excess of -1     The amplitude was then decreased to 27.
Cardiovascular: The infant did have an initial low blood     pressure and required 1 normal saline bolus with follow-up     blood pressures that were normal.
The infant will require an echocardiogram     and blood pressures will continue to need to be monitored.
This was increased     to 100 mL/kg/day after a repeat d-stick was 46.
The infant had an initial CBC with a     white count of 10.5, 50 neutrophils, 0 bands, 36 lymphs,     a crit of 38%, and a normal platelet count.
Extension of this treatment is to depend     upon the infant's clinical course and blood culture     results.
The infant will require a hearing screen at     some point.
Car seat and hearing screening - Not done at this time.
State newborn screen - Status pending.
Prematurity at 32 weeks.
