He was referred to cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who did an echocardiogram and found the patient to have cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of approximately 20 to 25%.
The patient had a Holter monitor without ventricular tachycardia.
He had clean coronary arteries, but the biopsy procedure was complicated by bleeding, cardiac tamponade, decreased blood pressure and PEA arrest.
A pericardial drain was placed and his blood pressure increased.
Repeat echocardiogram initially in the Coronary Care Unit showed a small collection of fluid.
The patient had presented with ventilator settings of AC570 by 12 and a ventilation of 10.4, PEEP of 5, 60%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 80, blood pressure 107/62, SPO2 100% and afebrile.
JVD unable to assess given positive pressure of ventilation.
LABORATORIES ON PRESENTATION TO THE CORONARY CARE UNIT: White blood cell count 4.8, hematocrit 34.7 and was 44 on admission.
Platelets 167.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.7, chloride 103, bicarb 28, anion gap 4, BUN 16, creatinine 1.1.
CK 123, MB index 6.5, MB 10.
Magnesium 1.6, calcium 7.7, phosphorus 1.8.
Status post a catheterization a clean coronary arteries, status post perforation secondary to biopsy complicated by tamponade.
Pulseless electrical activity arrest status post tamponade drain, transient use of pressors, status post 2 units of packed red blood cells, status post intubation and had an echocardiogram in the Coronary Care Unit with only a small amount of residual fluid.
Serial hematocrits: Final hematocrit was 32 at the day of discharge, stable throughout his stay following initial traumatic tamponode.
His heart rate would be in the 70s to 80s at rest and when the patient ate or moved around in bed his heart would shoot up to the 110s, 120s.
