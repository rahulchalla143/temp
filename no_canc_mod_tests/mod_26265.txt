Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed no significant coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 40 mmHg and low central aortic pressures 66/47 with a mean of 57 mmHg.
Supravalvular aortography revealed 3+ aortic regurgitation.
LVEF 45%.
The aortic mechanical valve is stable, fucntioning well with a transaortic mean gradient of 20mm of Hg.
Cardiac output is 5.2L/min.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).

There, severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 97 mm Hg was discovered.
The supravalvular aortography revealed 3+ aortic regurgitation.
Echocardiogram was consistent with tamponade and she eventually required re-exploration with significant improvement in hemodynamics.
Warfarin was eventually resumed and dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0.
Her postop creatinine peaked to 4.9, and by discharge creatinine improved to 1.7mg/dL.
