The patient had a CXR performed at [**Hospital1 5595**] which did not reveal any acute PNA, as well as stools positive for c.diff x1.
At [**Hospital1 5595**], the pt was found to have a tachycardia with HR to 150s-160s and a BP of 90/50 resulting in this ED presentations.
She became more hypotensive with SBP in the 70s to 80s and she was successfully cardioverted in the ED with return to NSR at 70s with some improvement in SBP to 100s.
Her SBP then decreased to 60s requiring low dose of neosynephrine.
In the ED, she had a WBC count of 25 and lactate of 2.3.
Her UA was neg and a CT abd/pelvis was performed, still pending read.

Mild anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 that is unchanged compared to prior study from [**2106-10-22**].
Aspiration is greatly reduced with nectar thick liquids and pureed solids, but not completely prevented, when using a  right head turn and a chin tuck, which the pt uses independently at this time.
Her troponin was slightly elevated to 0.05 on admission but CK and MB wer negative which rules out acute ischemia.
Hypotension: The hypotension may have been secondary to her AVnRT, however since her BP did not improve even after restoration of NSR at 70s, more likely due to her initial infected/septic presentation.
This was attributed to vasodilation from ongoing sepsis (tachycardia, WBC count with source of infection (c diff), and hypotension).
Patient was on pressors from [**Date range (1) 95249**] weaned off neo gtt on [**6-27**].
ID: Given the development of fever and diarrhea along with positive C.diff stool and WBC count of 20.5 on admission, this was most likely due to c.diff especially in the setting of recent antibiotic use.
CXR was without any clear evidence of new infiltrate or effusion.
