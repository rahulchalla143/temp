2 days ago on [**7-19**] the patient was noted to have acute worsening of her mentation following feeding, which was normally alert and verbal to be found complaining of shortness of breath, despite having normal oxygen saturations - she was found to have hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and anemia - she was treated for all three including transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs and subsequently underwent suctioning with transient improvement in her mental status.
She was found to be somnolent on arrival with a tongue bite and the differential included post-ictal state although no seizure activity was noted, this was confirmed with an EEG which showed slowing but no epileptiform activity.
She reportedly had a normal head CT, and a CT of the chest which revealed left lower lobe collapse which has been frequently noted on previous imaging studies.
Additionally, she was noted to have [**Last Name (un) **] and a significantly elevated vancomycin level - this was presumably held, but not clearly noted in the chart, there was an appreciable decline in the vancomycin trough between [**7-20**] to [**7-21**] from 50 to 30. .
This significantly improved her rigidity, but then her mental status did not improve and her spasticity returned gradually over several hours.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was noted to be completely unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli, occassionally grimacing to suction, but had no purposeful movements.
She was hemodynamically stable, but vital signs were notable for a bradycardia in the low 50s, BP was elevated, but not markedly so.
Labs were drawn, a CXR was ordered, and a neurology consult was ordered who initially recommended MRI/MRA of the head and neck.

CHEST X-RAY ([**2168-7-22**]): Repositioned left PICC now terminates in the upper SVC.
24-HOUR VIDEO EEG ([**2168-7-22**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of one brief generalized electrographic seizure at 04:23:38 as is described under Continuous EEG.
MRI/MRA BRAIN AND NECK WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2168-7-22**]): 1.
Appearance is similar to that seen on the previous MRI from [**2167-5-8**].
RENAL ULTRASOUND ([**2168-7-22**]): Normal-sized kidneys with increased cortical echogenicity consistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.
EEG ([**2168-7-23**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of generalized periodic epileptic discharges in the first half of the recording indicative of diffuse cortical irritability with potential epileptogenicity.
EEG ([**2168-7-24**]): This is  an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of moderate to severe generalized background slowing indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction of non-specific etiology.
Compared to prior day's recording, this study shows improvement with resolution of the epileptiform discharges through the recording as well as appearance of a more continuous and faster background activity.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2168-7-24**]): Compared to yesterday's study, there is overall interval stability of mild acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure, right lower lobe atelectasis, and opacification of the lingula.
EEG ([**2168-7-26**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study due to moderate diffuse background slowing with intermittent bursts of further generalized slowing suggestive of moderate generalized encephalopathy of non-specific etiology.
Compared to the prior day's recording, this study shows improvement with no epileptiform discharges.
Her GCS was E1V1M1.
Her OSH EEG reportedly showed no seizure activity.
Labs showed normal TSH, ammonia, cortisol.
They were however notable for acute renal failure (Cr 2.3, baseline Cr 0.3) and vancomycin toxicity (vanc level 37.1).
24-hour video EEG showed generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) superimposed on encephalopathic slowing, but no explicit seizures.
On discharge she remained on Keppra but the Baclofen, Tizanidine, Morphine and Tramadol were all stopped given that her renal function was still not back to baseline.
Sputum cultures grew out MRSA, Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas on [**7-21**].
Given her bronchiectasis, positive cultures were found to be likely secondary to chronic colonization.
Because consecutive chest Xrays showed complete LLL collapse (result of prior episodes of Pseudomonas pneumonia and consistent with prior CXRs) with potential worsening with pulmonary edema, the patient was diuresed with 50 mg IV Lasix daily.
The patient had a renal ultrasound which showed diffuse parenchymal disease.
Urine eos x 3 were sent out, only 1 of which returned mildly positive.
The patient's vanc levels were monitored and continued to downtrend from her vanc level at admission (51) to 24.5 on [**7-27**].
The patient's Creatinine and urine ouput was monitored and the patient also received 40 mg Lasix IV daily to help with her volume overload.
The patient's lisinopril, tizanidine and tramadol were held during her hospitalization to limit exposure to potentially nephrotoxic medications.
#Hypernatremia: The patient was mildly hypernatremic on [**7-27**] with a serum Na of 147.
The patient's free water flushes were increased and her serum Na monitored.
#HTN: The patient's lisinopril was held while she was in renal failure, but she was treated with IV Hydralazine prn for SBPs > 160.
#Anemia: The patient had a Hct of 29.4 at admission.
The patient's Hct was 25.9 on [**7-27**], but her stool guaiac was negative.
Given her toxic vanc levels, IV vanc was held and levels were trended throughout hospitalization: trended down to 24.5 on [**7-27**].
