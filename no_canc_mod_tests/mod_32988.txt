Per notes he had HD yesterday and received 2 units PRBCS during HD and hct was 35 during HD.
INR was noted to be 4.3 , so pt received 5 mg of vitamin K. VS at NH were T 97.5 HR 104 BP 108/59 and sats of 98%.
Hs HR was initialy in the 90s with BP 108/53.
Upon arrival to the floor, the pt's initial SBP was in the 70s, with HR in the 120s.

EGD [**2150-4-2**] Impression: Internal bumper of the recently placed PEG tube was seen in place.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2150-4-4**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-4-17**] FINDINGS: The image did not include the lung bases; however, there is opacification in the right lung base secondary to atelectasis and effusion.
The patient had a tagged red blood cell scan to identify the source of bleeding, which was negative.
He was transfused 8 units of PRBCs as well as 2 units of FFP on day of admission, and his HCT remained stable above 30.
Although his HCT remained stable, he continued to be guaiac positive.
He was a second EGD on [**4-20**], which showed no source of bleeding.
His ASA and coumadin were restarted.
However, in the setting of diuresis, the patient dropped his blood pressures and required Neo to maintain SBP over 90 and MAP greater than 55.
At discharge, his SBP ranged at 100s-110s.
He was started on midodrine to support his BP during dialysis.
He was also transiently on digoxin for improved rate control while on CVVH; this was discontinued as his HR came under better control with BB.
HR on discharge was in the 50-60s.
The catheter tip culture has no growth to time of discharge.
He had HD, where 3L were removed and his sats did not improve significantly.
He was requiring .7% FiO2, CXR showed partial collapse of his left lung.
Sputum culture from [**4-8**] showed acinetobacter and stenotrophomonas, initially not treated because it was felt these could be colonizers.
However, in the context of his increased oxygen requirement and cxr findings he was started on tobramycin and was already on vanc for a presumed line infection (positive blood cultures).
If tobramycin level is >2, dose will required adjustment.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed.
Your INR was also high, which was a contributing factor.
While in the hostpial you had an infection of your urinary tract that was treated, your blood pressure was also low.
You had alot of fluid removed in dialysis and your current weight, which is your dry weight is 147 kg.
Your blood pressure is now fine off the medications.
A BAL was done [**4-21**], with no growth to date.
