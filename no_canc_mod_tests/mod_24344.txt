RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2137-12-1**]):       SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Abdominal ultrasound with doppler ([**11-27**]): 1.
EEG ([**11-28**]): IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow background with bursts of additional generalized slowing.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of hepatitis and altered mental status.
Your hematocrit, or red blood cell count, has been low, which we suspect is due to the hepatitis and the blood loss from the abortion.
It is important that you follow-up at [**Hospital 84286**] Community Health Center next week (an appointment has been scheduled) so that you can have the complete blood count and liver enzymes checked.
