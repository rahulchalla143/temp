On admission, patient's INR had fallen to 2.7; however, given fall in setting of elevated INR, but had a trauma evaluation including CT head, spine, Abd/pelvis and LLE without evidence of bleed or fracture.
At the time, she was admitted for pain control and monitoring of hematocrit (34.6-->31.9).
Of note, patient has a h/o HTN; on admission was noted to have low BPs (usual SBP 140-160s, on admission SBP 100), but was asymptomatic (no LH/dizziness/CP/SOB/fatigue).

Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: [**2201-2-14**]: 1:15pm Hct 34.6 [**2201-2-15**]: 07:00am Hct 31.9, INR 2.9, PTT 42.1 [**2201-2-15**]: 6:00pm Hct 30.0 * Chemistries: GLUCOSE-94 UREA N-21* CREAT-1.4* SODIUM-134 POTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-99 TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-14 * Radiologic Studies- CT left knee: No evidence of hemarthrosis or fracture of the left knee.
* Femur/Tib Fib Plain Films: Negative for fracture * CXR PA/LAT [**2-17**]: Bilateral plate-like atelectasis at the lung bases, left greater than right.
* CXR PA/LAT [**2-19**]: No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion   Brief Hospital Course: 54 y/o female with CAD, mechanical AVR, MVannuloplasty, on coumadin, who was admitted for pain control s/p fall with hospital course c/b hypotension and hematocrit drop of unclear etiology requiring [**Name (NI) 153**] overnight observation.
Hypotension: On admission the patient was found to have a blood pressure in 100's systolic.
CT scan of the thigh and pelvis were performed which showed no evidence of bleed.
CT head on admission was also negative for bleed.
SBP decreased to the 80's-90's and she was given NS prn boluses to maintain BP >100.
During her hospitalization, her BPs remained on the low side and required prn NS boluses.
Her hematocrits were also being followed.
Afternoon of [**2-17**], patient was found to have a SBP 70s.
Had an EKG which showed a new RBBB.
Given her history of significant cardiac disease and new RBBB, cardiology was consulted and a stat bedside echo was performed to r/o cardiogenic shock, which was unchanged from prior echo.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], hematocrit that was checked showed drop 29.7 to 25.9.
She had a [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test to r/o adrenal insufficiency as cause for her hypotension, which was normal.
CXR showed vague RLL infiltrate, and she was started on empiric vancomycin/levofloxacin pending culture data.
She remained stable overnight, with stable blood pressure and hematocrit and was transferred back to the medicine service.
On return to the medicine service her blood pressures gradually normally, trending upwards to 120's systolic of anti-hypertensives.
Her blood pressure meds may be re-started as outpatient as her BP/HR tolerates.
In addition, repeat CXR PA and Lat showed resolution of vague RLL infiltrate.
Her LDH on admission was mildly elevated w/ Haptoglobin less than 20.
However, her levels were not significantly elevated from baseline to suggest this as the cause of her acute hematocrit drop.
As mentioned she had no evidence of bleed by multiple CT studies.
Her hct drop may have been dilutional secondary to recieving aggressive IVF repletion with her hypotension.
Following her transfusion in the ICU, her hematocrit remained stable at 30 and she required no further transfusions.
She was started on IV heparin since her INR was sub-therapeutic and she was continued on this until her INR was greater than 2 on coumadin.
Plan to re-start atenolol once blood pressure tolerates.
LLL pneumonia: Initial evidence of pneumonia by CXR vs atelectasis.
However subsequent CXR 2 days later showed no evidence of pneumonia.
