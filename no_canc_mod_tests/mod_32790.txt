Her isotope study showed lateral ischemia.
([**9-2**]) Her cath revealed a proximal 80% long lesion, totally occluded Cx, occluded diagnoal, mild RCA disease.

Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Cardiac catheterization [**2166-9-3**]: COMMENTS: 1- Limited selective coronary angiography confirmed the presence of a long mid LAD 80% stenosis with a totally and chronically occluded long diagonal branch (originates from the diseased LAD segment).
2- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment showed normal systemic  arterial BP (130/70).
3- Successful PTCA of the chronically and totally occluded diagonal branch with 20% residual ostial stenosis, TIMI 3 flow and no dissection or distal emboli.
Final angiography whosed no residual stenosis with TIMI 3 flow and no dissection or distal emboli.
The portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.
The study was obtained in lordotic projection.
CXR clear, LS without crackles and no peripheral edema.
ECHO [**Last Name (un) **] preserved EF.
Right shoulder films showed no fracture.
EKG and CK's stable, not thought to be cardiac related.
pt will need LFT's checked in 2 months and then at 6 months to assess for transaminitis.
No wheezes on exam or O2 requirement.
CPAP machine offered to pt but mask did not fit well and pt ref to use.
