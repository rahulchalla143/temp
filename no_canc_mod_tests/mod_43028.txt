ABNORMALITY #2: The background rhythm is disorganized and slowed in the [**5-6**] Hz theta frequency range with intermittent generalized delta frequency slowing.
HYPERVENTILATION: Was not performed due to the patient's clinical condition.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 72 bpm.
CT head: FINDINGS: Comparison with the prior head CT scan of [**2111-8-12**] re- demonstrates moderate cerebral atrophy, most evident in both frontal lobes.
MRI/MRA head and neck: Comparison was made with the previous MRI of [**2111-3-4**].
Fluid levels are visualized in both maxillary, sphenoid, and ethmoid sinuses.
Bifrontal and temporal atrophy, which has increased since the previous MRI study of [**2111-3-4**].
CT and MRI ruled out any acute infract but was noteable for known fronto-temporal atrophy consistent with her dementia.
She had an EEG which did not show any evidence of electrographic seizures.
Laboratory workup revealed no evidence of metabolic or toxic cause for her event.
As well, there was also a question of airway obstruction during sleep (OSA) and the family agreed a sleep study would be informative at a later date (to be scheduled by Dr.[**Name (NI) 14065**] office).
