Coronary artery disease: The patient reports a "massive heart attack" 16 years ago.

[**2197-10-27**] CT HEAD - No intracranial hemorrhage or other acute intracranial abnormality.
[**2197-10-19**] R LE art ext (rest) study - There is significant outflow arterial insufficiency at the level of the distal popliteal or proximal tibial artery.
EKG: [**2197-10-25**] 14:00, NSR, LAD, ?q's inferiorly, no STE/STD.
TWF V4-6, V1.
EEG: ([**11-22**]): This is an abnormal video EEG study due to periodic generalized sharp and slow wave discharges with bifrontal predominance at 1-1.5 Hz frequency.
Interictal background activity showed severe diffuse slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies consistent with a severe diffuse encephalopathy  ([**11-13**]): This 24 hour video EEG telemetry demonstrated generalized and bifrontal, spike and sharp wave discharges that evolved into periods of sustained, rhythmic discharges, consistent with an underlying non-convulsive status epilepticus.
Over the next day, the patient's blood pressure was stable, and the Neo drip was weaned off.
His Tmax was 101.0, and his R LE wound swab grew Pseduomonas.
On [**10-25**] @ 0847AM, the pt was noted to have A. FIB with RVR 160s, SBP 95/60s->60/40, prompting re-starting the neo gtt and transfer to CVICU with cardiology consultation.
Cardiac enzymes were obtained, and his troponin ranged from 0.40 to 0.53, with flat CK, MB peaked at 10.
TTE was obtained without new focal wall motion abnormality.
BP was 83/40, albumin hung, and BP increased.
On [**10-27**], pt continued to be oliguric, with SBP in 80s, despite albumin and fluid boluses.
He was placed on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ABG was drawn (7.05/81/43 @ 4AM); he was re-started on neo gtt, and then intubated for respiratory distress (no O2 sats in chart, time 04:46AM on [**10-27**]).
His CVICU course is not documented, but he received 2U PRBC (HCT 27->34->27).
Repeat TTE ordered (EF more depressed), heparin gtt stopped.
MRI or LP without etiology for mental status changes.
His ABG (7.05/81/43) during the initial event was consistent with hypoventilation--likely contributors include myopathy (?
His CXR and exam were additionally consistent with volume overload, without frank evidence of pneumonia.
PE was thought to be less likely, given the pt's therapeutic INR and on heparin gtt.
# Hypotension - The patient had several episodes of hypotension while admitted, including post-operatively, in the setting of A.fib w. RVR, after diuresis, and while being treated with AEDs for status epilepticus (see below).
A wound culture grew Pseudomononas with sensitivities as noted above.
Given this, an EEG was obtained, which showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures (see report above).
Further during MICU course he underwent an LP (WBC 1, RBC 1, 0% polys, 52% lymphs) and an MRI brain (no epileptogenic focus), which were both essentially unrevealing of an etiology for the pt's seizures.
CSF protein electrophoresis showed no oligoclonal banding.
HSV, VZV, and [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] negative.
Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1.
Lactate WNL (1.2).
?with the pt's chronic respiratory acidosis,  LE ischemia, septic physiology from his wound infection, and uremia [**12-19**] ARF (see below) all contributing.
# Acute renal failure: The pt had rising Cr (peak 1.6 on [**11-11**]) and decreasing urine output over [**11-7**] to [**11-11**].
Urine lytes showed FeNa = 2, which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts in urine.
# PVD s/p R BKA, distant L BKA - His right LE wound cxr grew Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime.
