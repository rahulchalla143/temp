CT neck with contrast ([**2105-4-16**]): Retropharyngeal fluid collection spanning from C2/3 to C5/6 with extensive surrounding edema and inflammation of the hypopharynx.
CXR ([**2105-4-17**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
CT neck and chest w/ contrast ([**2105-4-18**]): 1.
Chest CT ([**4-22**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Small dependent left pleural effusion has also increased in size since the prior study but does not have loculated components.
TTE ([**4-22**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**4-23**] CXR REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient with complicated pleural effusion.
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to [**2105-4-21**].

#Epiglottis/retropharyngenal phlegmon: Diagnosed on CT neck and by ENT scope.
Repeat CT neck and chest with contrast, in the setting of ongoing posterior neck pain and inspiration pain as well as worsening erythematous lesion (see below), did not show Lemierre's or mediastinitis.
Blood cultures from admission were positive for GNRs, later grew out HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE.
Repeat cultures were negative ????
HIV was sent and was negative.
Derm did not feel compelled to biopsy - they thought it was likely due to her infectious process but did not represent a cellulitis.
Medicine was consulted on [**4-22**], and in setting of new moderate pleural effusions R>L on CXR, recommended chest CT, which showed rapidly expanding and loculated effusion on R. She was then transferred to medicine, and ID was consulted.
#Hypertension: Blood pressures normal and intermittently high (SBPs 150s) in-house.
# Intermittent bradycardia to 40s, asymptomatic: She was monitored on telemetry with occasional intermittent bradycardia to the 40s.
her EKG was otherwise normal, without AVB.
TTE was done which showed no HD significant pericardial effusion, abscess, or vegetations.
Her bradycardia may have been due to vagal tone in setting of pleural effusions and pleuritic pain.
