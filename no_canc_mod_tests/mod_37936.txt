On presentation, he was found to have a blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio of 124 to 2.9 which was significantly increased from his baseline.
Biventricular heart failure/congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%; thought secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2086**] with cardiogenic shock at the age of 47; status post cardiac catheterization in [**2102-5-22**] with 50% proximal left anterior descending artery, severe pulmonary hypertension, wedge of 14, and global hypokinesis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of 97.4, blood pressure of 116/77, respiratory rate of 14, saturating 100% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed mucous membranes were moist.
Cardiovascular examination revealed soft first heart sound, obliterated second heart sound.
Pulmonary revealed mild bibasilar crackles; otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories at the time of admission revealed a white blood cell count of 7.4, hematocrit of 39, platelets of 199.
Sodium of 128, potassium of 3.9, chloride of 83, bicarbonate of 20, blood urea nitrogen of 124, creatinine of 2.9, blood glucose of 110.
Calcium of 9.1, magnesium of 3.2, phosphate of 7.2.
Digoxin level of 2.8.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed a right pleural effusion; unchanged, with right-sided atelectasis, dual chamber pacemaker placed, questionable left lower extremity opacity, possibly consistent with pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram revealed AV paced at 61 beats per minute with left axis deviation, QRS of 122 seconds to 200 seconds.
The patient was initially admitted to the Medicine floor and then subsequently he was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for more intensive hemodynamic monitoring and further management.
Cardiac index of 1.12 with a cardiac output of 1.9.
As the patient's blood pressure fell slightly with Milrinone, a vasopressin was added with subsequent stabilization of his blood pressure.
The patient's pacemaker was interrogated by the Electrophysiology team, and his baseline heart rate was increased to 80 in an attempt to improve his cardiac output and cardiac index.
However, over the next few hospital days, the patient's cardiac output and cardiac index continued to decrease despite optimal Milrinone and vasopressin therapy in addition to continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
RENAL:  The patient had a baseline chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.1 which was increased to 2.9 at the time of admission.
A Renal consultation was obtained at the time of admission to comment on the appropriateness of initiating hemodialysis given the patient's overall fluid overload state.
In addition, the patient was maintained on Phos-Lo and Amphojel given his elevated phosphorous levels, and his electrolytes were followed carefully on a b.i.d.
However, despite adequate diuresis and hemodialysis the patient continued to remain oliguric and continued to demonstrate a decrease in cardiac output and index.
PULMONARY:  The patient was felt to have a questionable left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray at the time of admission.
However, the patient had no signs or symptoms suggestive of a pneumonia on a clinical basis, and therefore antibiotics were withheld unless the patient had an increase in a white blood cell count of fever.
The family was present in the room at the time of the death, and an autopsy was refused at that time.
