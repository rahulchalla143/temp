[**2130-6-13**] PSIF T2-T11   History of Present Illness: 54 yoF w/ a h/o IDDM, CAD s/p CABG in [**2128**], CHF with an EF of 30% s/p ICD plcmt who initially presented to [**Hospital3 2568**] on [**4-24**] with a complaint of R sided back pain (sudden onset, R mid back pain, worsened with coughing) and shortness of breath, as well as a few weeks of increasing lower extremity edema.
She was aggressively diuresed initially to the point which her Cr increased from initiall normal to 4.9.
An initial CT of the chest showed mild angulation of the thoracic spine as well as multilobar pneumonia, so the patient was started on vanc in addition to her levaquin.
A repeat CT of the spine on [**5-20**] revealed major thoracic kyphosis and compression, in addition she was noted to have an fluid collection (possible abscess) extending along the soft tissue pre vertebral surface from T7-T9.

Correlation with a dedicated CT of the chest is recommended if clinically warranted.
CT THORACIC SPINE WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST [**2130-5-29**]  IMPRESSION: 1.
The appearance of the abscesses is similar to prior study of [**2130-5-20**].
CT MYELOGRAM T-SPINE [**2130-6-7**] IMPRESSION:  Compression deformity with moderate-to-severe spinal stenosis and borderline cord compression at the T7 vertebral level.
Please see report of the cervical and lumbar spines for additional information.
EEG [**2130-6-14**] FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording the background rhythm was of very low voltage such that no definite activity of cortical origin could be seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2130-6-14**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and infero-lateral/apical akinesis.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2130-6-29**] - no significant change from [**2130-6-14**]  PORTABLE CHEST [**2130-7-9**] AT 05:20 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study there is no significant interval change with continued demonstration of distended pulmonary vasculature, cardiomegaly and blunted CP angle.

Of note, pt's strength exam was very inconsistent and thought to possibly have a component of lack of effort as she did not move on command but was able to withdraw from pain/Babinski.
Pt received multiple imaging studies including spine CT without contrast, spine CT with contrast, chest/abd/pelvis CT with contrast, EMG, bone scan and tagged WBC.
Repeat CT scan was obtained (see results section) and the decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention.
CPR was performed and the rhythm was pharmacologically converted.
Neurology was consulted and EEG was performed which was consistent with anoxic brain injury.
CT head did not reveal any bleed or large infarct.
MRI head was not obtainable due to the patient's pacemaker.
She was able to grossly move bilateral lower extremities by rolling her hips, but no more distal movement was observed.
# Acute renal failure: Pt's creatinine rose on [**5-4**] from baseline of 1.2-1.5 and peaked on [**5-10**] at 4.9.
Pt underwent biopsy at [**Hospital3 2568**], with nonspecific results not ruling out Henoch Schlonlein Purpura.
# CHF: Pt known to have ischemic CHF with EF 30-35%.
Her WBC count was 19,000 and she had a R sided pleural effusion requiring chest tube.
Since transfer pt had been afebrile, had normal WBC count, and CXR showed small persistent effusions but consolidation resolved.
# CAD: Pt had a recent CABG ([**2128**]) and was continued home medications including aspirin per okay of spine surgery.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Osteomyelitis, paraspinal abscess, lower extremity weakness  Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Wound care: Keep incisions covered with dry dressings, change daily and prn.
