Just prior to admission, the patient had a barium swallow study to evaluate a known hiatal hernia and had a normal bowel movement on the day prior to admission which was consisting mainly of barium from that swallow study.
Attempts were made in the Emergency Department to place a nasogastric tube, but this was unsuccessful secondary to the patient's discomfort.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  His medications at the time of admission included Plavix, digoxin, Florinef, Levoxyl, Acufex, and Timoptic eyedrops.
His temperature was 98.2, his blood pressure was 152/78, heart rate was 88, respiratory rate was 20, and his oxygen saturation was 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory evaluation at the time of admission revealed white blood cell count was 9.5, hematocrit was 42, and platelets were 331.
Sodium was 141, potassium was 3.5, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 14, creatinine was 0.8, and blood glucose was 110.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed no acute disease.
A portable abdominal examination revealed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
He was admitted for aggressive fluid resuscitation, and as needed blood transfusion, and blood pressure control.
The upper gastrointestinal study revealed an incarcerated hiatal hernia, and a General Surgery consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 100353**] was obtained.
The patient had tests which were positive for Helicobacter pylori, and he was started on an additional antibiotic regiment to treat this.
By postoperative day seven, the patient was having difficulty tolerating oral intake, and an x-ray evaluation revealed that there was gas-filled colon, indicating an apparent obstruction versus a pseudo-obstruction.
On the day and evening of [**11-2**], the patient developed low urine output which was not responding to fluid boluses, and despite the fluid boluses and blood transfusion, the patient continued to have low urine output and went into respiratory distress; for which he required intubation which was performed by the Anesthesia staff.
The patient underwent a computed tomography angiogram of his chest which was negative for pulmonary embolism and also underwent serial cycling of cardiac enzymes and was found to not have a myocardial infarction.
In the Intensive Care Unit, he underwent invasive monitoring of his blood pressure and his pulmonary performance and remained intubated.
The remainder of his hospital course was characterized by a pseudo-obstruction which failed to resolve despite rectal tubes and colonic decompression by the gastroenterologist by endoscopy.
Pan-cultures were essentially negative, and the sputum cultures grew only expected respiratory flora.
He did have a point during this course where he required dobutamine for his blood pressure which was able to be weaned off.
