CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
CT OF THE CHEST PRE- AND POST-IV CONTRAST: There are no pleural effusions.
Lung window images demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN POST-IV CONTRAST: 2 small hypodensities are seen within the inferior most margin of the right lobe of the liver, which are too small to characterize, but likely represent cysts.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The upper pelvis was imaged.
CT ANGIOGRAM: There is evidence of prior aortic surgery with clips and what appears to be an anastomosis just superior to the native aortic valve.
Comparison with prior examinations is recommended.
If available, outside prior CT examinations should be obtained for comparison.
