Reports: [**2144-6-12**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: A central line is unchanged, terminating at the aortocaval junction.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to the radiograph of [**2144-6-3**].
[**2144-6-12**] Radiology CT ABDOMEN PELVIS: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A right-sided pleural effusion and bilateral lower lobe multifocal patchy opacities are again demonstrated not significantly changed compared to the prior study.
The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, stomach, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
Unchanged appearance of the chest compared to the prior study with a right-sided pleural effusion and patchy multifocal opacities.
A day after the sigmoidoscopy, he underwent HD where he was afebrile and stable, and was transported to the GI suite for possible colonoscopy but developed severe rigor and fever.
He was later transferred to the floor where his BP was stable at SBP 90-110's.
Serial surveillance cultures have been negative.
Blood cultures were sent.
A [**Name (NI) 5283**] sono was negative and a port chest and KUB did not demonstrate any evidence of disease including free air.
Additionally, C. Diff toxin was sent which was positive depite having received 9+ days of Flagyl.
A LUE US revealed partial obstruction of the left IJ and Left basilic vein.
The patient was given 1 unit of blood overnight.
The patient was fairly stable on the floor with SBP 100-110 with plans of possible discharge back to nursing facility, as this was what patient repeatedly told medical team he wished to do.
The patient was ordered for a portable chest film, but was with satisfactory O2 sats on NC.
The patient was placed on a non-rebreather, an ABG and stat port film were performed and the MICU team was called to evaluate the patient.
The patient was placed back on 100% O2 on non-rebreather, but was maintaining BP 90-110 without pressors.
AM labs revealed that the patient had 25bands and was currently unweanable from 100% non-rebreather.
Given the above and his recent medical decompensation, thought likely to represent sepsis and DIC, the decision was made, agreed upon by all healthcare workers involed in his care, that Mr. [**Known lastname 52065**] would not have wanted continued aggressive medical management.
The decision was made to place the patient on comfort care, and all medical treatments including blood draws and HD were stopped.
On last admission, all stool studies were negative and his diarrhea slowly resolved.
CT of the abdomen showing wall thickening of the ascending, transverse, and descending colon.
Again, all of the stool studies were negative including C.diff toxin A and B upon admission.
3)Pneumonia: CXR in MICU suggestive of possible PNA as well as worsening right side pleural effusion which was tapped.
However, he had a drop in plt count to the 40's.
HIT antibody was sent which came back positive.
Repeat HIT was negative as was Serotonin Release Assay.
Also he may need a legal guardianship.
