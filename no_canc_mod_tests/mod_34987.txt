She had a non contrast CT scan [**6-17**] reviewed by our ED radiologist confirming impression which reads: "moderate left pelvocalyceal and ureteral dilation with perirenal stranding and fascial thickening.
Temp spiked to 102 at 2AM with drop in BP to 87/41 at 3:30 AM for which she was given  1L NS.
Pertinent labs prior to transfer included creatinine of 1, TSH 6.24, normal LFT's, WBC 3.2 with 21% bands, HCT 37.9. .
WBC was 13.8 on admission and rose to 19.1 with fever up to 102.
She was initially treated with Zosyn for a UTI however this was stopped when her culture returned with only 20,000 colonies ESBL E.col (resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, augmentin, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, sensitive to gent, nitrofurantoin, tobramycin, TMP/SMX).
HCT on admission was 27, she was transfused 1 unit PRBC with increase in HCT to 28, with drop to 23 on repeat for which she was transfused antother 2 units with bump to 30 where she remained for the duration of her admission.
CT abdomen did not show any stones but did show hemorrhage in intrarenal collecting system.
She had CT urogram [**2108-6-10**] which showed "moderate hydro on right, mild hydro on L, blood in both intrarenal collecting systems, R>L, focal filling defect in proximal left interrenal collecting systmes, proximal ureter renal pelvis region measuring 9mm.
Renal U/S [**2108-6-13**] showed "the right kidney does not have hydronephrosis, echogenic material in right renal pelvis".
In the ED VS on presentation with 86/44, HR 122 T 100.9 RR 32 96% on 2L NC.
She was initially given 2l IVF with improvement in BP to 100-130's, she was also given vancomycin 1gIV and Zosyn 4g IV.
After one hour her blood pressure dropped to 70's-80's systolic, she was given IVF X4L, RIJ was placed and she was started on levophen and dopamine gtt and transferred to the ICU.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS:TM 99.6 HR 115 (94-129), BP 109/50 (90/46 - 144/63)  RR 14-24 CVP 11([**8-18**])  I=8L  O = 250 HEENT: NC AT, PERRL, dry mucosa, JVP elevated at angle of jaw CV: RRR, s1 s2, no appreciable murmur Lungs: harsh crackles to [**12-7**] way bilaterally, no wheezes Abd: soft, NT, ND, BS +, no flank tenderness on exam Ext: warm, no pedal edema, DP's full bilaterally Skin: no rashes or lesions noted   Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: Na 140 K 3.9 Cl 107 HCO 19 BUN 24 Creat 1.2 Gluc 127 lactate 3.5 CK 50 MB - Trop 0.26 WBC 13.5 HCT 33.2 PLT 337 UA: trace leuk, lg blood, nitr neg, 500 protein, 0-2 WBC, few bacteria, 0-2epis  Micro: [**2108-6-17**] Blood Cultures: 4/4 bottles GNR [**2108-6-17**] Urine Cultures: no growth  Imaging: [**2108-6-17**] CXR: There is a new right IJ central venous catheter with distal lead tip in the proximal SVC.
[**2108-6-17**] Renal U/S - (dictation) mild to moderate hydronephrosis of left kidney, echogenic material in several papillae and renal pelvis, right kidney with no hydronephrosis, echogenic material in renal pelvis and several calyces, collapsed bladder with foley catheter in place.
[**2108-6-19**] MRI Abdomen: Limited study, but no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal obstruction.
[**2108-6-20**] Noncontrast CT Head: (preliminary) Normal unenhanced study   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Mrs.[**Known lastname **] is a 77 yo F with PMH Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent UTI admitted with urosepsis on two pressors.
#Urosepsis: Blood cultures from admission yielded GNR bacteremia, with 4/4 bottles positive in <12 hours.
Pt also had ESBL E.coli grow out on urine culture from previous week.
Pt also had dramatic increase in WBC count from 13 on admission to 75.3, raising suspicion that intrarenal pus accumulation secondary to pylonephritis is causing leukocytosis and oliguria via obstruction.
Pt underwent chest x-ray showing no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary source of infection.
MRI showed no hydronephrosis, abscess or obstruction.
#Acute renal failure/Oliguria: Baseline creatinine 0.8, rose as high as 2.2 during admission before returning to 1.3.
Initial renal ultrasound reportedly concerning for papillary necrosis with most likely causes in this case being pyelonephritis, analgesics nephropathy (given longterm daily percocet use) or hypotension in the setting of sepsis.
Urine output and renal function gradually returned with stabilization of hemodynamics.
Noncontrast CT was obtained showing no acute pathology.
Further sedation was held and serial neuro exams completed.
Pts confusion improved over the course to the next 72hours.
#Coagulopathy - elevated PT/PTT with INR at 1.6 from normal baseline likely secondary to sepsis.
Heme/Onc classified elevated INR and decreased platelets as a leukemoid reaction that would require no further evaluation at this time.
#Demand myocardial ischemia - with isolated bump in troponin on admission with peak of 0.26, CK and MB flat, likely due to severe hypotension in setting of sepsis.
No further evaluation was warranted.
Echo eas performed that showed an EF of 45-50%.
