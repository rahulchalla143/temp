A liver biopsy was performed on [**11-6**] noting mild to focally moderate Zone 3 cholestasis with focal feathery degeneration of hepatocytes, consistent with preservation/reperfusion injury.
On [**11-9**], repeat liver duplex showed patent hepatic vasculature.
An ERCP was performed on [**11-10**].
A renal biopsy was performed on [**11-11**] showing considerable donor chronic vascular changes and some of the findings raise the possibility of (donor) diabetic nephropathy.
