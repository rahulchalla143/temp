Here in the Emergency Room, she was tachypneic and hypertensive, and arterial blood gas revealed ventilatory failure for which she was intubated.
In the Emergency Department, CT scan of the head revealed a question of left frontal early ischemic lesion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.1 F.; heart rate 60 to 70; blood pressure 120/90; respiratory rate, intubated.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 6,800, hematocrit of 42.8, platelets 199,000.
Sodium 134, potassium 5.4, chloride 99, CO2 of 32, BUN 26, creatinine 1.1, glucose 105, ALT 188, AST 239, LDH 2137.
Urinalysis was nitrite positive, positive white blood cells, positive bacteria.
Arterial blood gas revealed gas of 7.17/103/107.
EKG was normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, large P wave in II, T's decreased in III, AVF and V2 through V5.
CT scan of the head showed negative bleed, question left frontal cortex, hypodense, question edema and infarction.
EKG and head CT scan was suggestive of ischemic process of the brain.
Also, urinalysis is suggestive of urinary tract infection.
Chest [**Known lastname 37493**] was revealing of only mild congestive heart failure with oxygen saturations stable.
The patient underwent cardiac echocardiogram on [**11-25**], which showed positive left ventricular hypertrophy.
No thrombus was seen and ejection fraction estimated at 45% with apical lateral hypokinesis.
The patient's neurologic examination at this time:  The patient squeezes with left hand only and wiggles left toes only.
An MRI/MRA performed on [**11-26**], showed hemorrhage into the left frontal infarction with midline shift; no significant carotid stenosis was seen and right frontal area of apparent hemorrhage, the patient's carotids appeared normal on MRA.
The patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram on [**11-27**], which showed left atrium normal in size.
No ASD or patent foramen ovale was seen by 2D color Doppler or saline contrast maneuvers.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic with ejection fraction greater than 75%.
No vegetations or thrombi were identified compared to trans-thoracic study of [**11-25**].
The patient had a head CT scan done on [**2149-11-28**], which showed two areas of hemorrhage:  The first was located in the left frontal lobe in the region of the infarction first seen on [**11-25**].
The size of the hemorrhage and extensive surrounding edema and mass effect is unchanged from the MRI of [**11-26**].
A second area of hemorrhage is seen as a small 3 mm hyperdense region, high in the sulcus of the parietal lobe.
Bone windows show fluid levels within the sphenoid sinus; these are unchanged from MRI of [**11-26**].
On [**12-1**], the patient self extubated thought to be secondary to a respiratory muscle weakness and shallow breaths with respiratory rate into the fifties and delta MF.
The patient's blood pressure was labile throughout her Intensive Care Unit stay.
The patient would have episodes of blood pressure 200 to 100 which would resolve either spontaneously or with Lopressor.
Lability of the blood pressure stabilized throughout her Intensive Care Unit stay.
q. day and blood pressure ranged at the end of the MICU stay was from 110 to 170 systolic.
Neurology recommended an MR of the cervical spine which was done on [**2149-12-5**], showed no evidence of cord compression or neural impingement.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy at the time showed normal EGD to the stomach.
The patient had a CT scan of the chest on [**2149-12-5**], to assess for possible primary pulmonary process, and to assess for previous needs for intubation and prolonged ventilation.
This study revealed no gross evidence of interstitial lung disease, bibasilar dependent opacities, more prominent on the right lower lobe than the left; may represent atelectasis.
The patient had original respiratory rate of 40 to 50; this slowly came down into the 20s.
Repeat arterial blood gas on trache mask revealed no elevated hypercarbia above normal.
