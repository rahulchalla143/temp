She is transferred emergently from [**Hospital 189**] Hospital for evaluation of the pulseless legs.
The left kidney demonstrates delayed nephrogram and scattered areas of wedge-shaped transcortical hypoattenuation, consistent with renal infarction.
CT PELVIS:  Assessment is highly limited due to streak artifact from bilateral hip arthroplasty.
A large expansile lytic lesion within the left ischial tuberosity is incompletely assessed and could be correlated with prior exam and clinical history.
Recommend correlation with prior imaging and clinical history.
[**2156-7-22**] CTA 1.
[**2156-8-9**] CT 1.
Arterial duplex demonstrated a likely chronic subclavian stenosis.
Nitropaste was applied without improvement, so on POD2 she underwent angioplasy and steting of her L subclavian artery with improvement in her blood flow.
A TTE was performed showing a large mobile right atrial thrombus and loculated pericardial effusion with tamponade.
There was concern at this point for HITT so she was changed to bivalrudin, but her HITT antibody was negative and she was replaced on heparin.
A CTA torso at this time showed no pulmonary embolism, but did show a high grade stenosis of her SMA.
The following day she had her staples removed from her initial operation and her antibiotics were stopped.
She was reintubated and underwent bronchoscopy showing mucous plugging and very friable and hyperemic tracheal and bronchial mucosa.
A CT abdomen was performed and she was noted to have continued free air, but no extravasation of contrast.
However, since her PEG tract was not matured she returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, closure gastrostomy, and placement of jejunal feeding tube.
