On presentation to the Emergency Department, the patient had a lithium level of 3.3, an increased creatinine to 5.2, and a chest x-ray with left lower lobe infiltrate, as well as a white blood cell count of 28.
Her last lithium level was one to five months ago.
The patient was emergently hemodialyzed on [**10-27**], and a recheck lithium level was 1.6 and then 1.5 on [**10-28**].
Her creatinine has decreased to 3.7 on transfer to the medicine floor (her baseline creatinine is 1.2).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed the patient's temperature was 98.9 degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 109/40, her heart rate was 84, her respiratory rate was 23, and her oxygen saturation was 95% on 5 liters via nasal cannula.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was lethargic.
Gait testing was not assessed secondary to the patient's Quinton catheter in place.
Neck examination was difficult to assess secondary to body habitus.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Pulmonary examination revealed scattered rhonchi with a few expiratory wheezes bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally in the lower extremities.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission revealed her white blood cell count was 16.5 (with a differential of 85% neutrophils, 0% bands, 9% lymphocytes, and 2% monocytes), her hematocrit was 37.7, and her platelets were 257.
Her prothrombin time was 13.9, her partial thromboplastin time was 27.5, and her INR was 1.3.
Sodium was 126 (although repeat was 139), potassium was 3.1, chloride was 97, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 43, creatinine was 3.7 (increased from 3.4 from the day before), and her blood glucose was 257.
Calcium was 8.6, magnesium was 1.9, and her phosphorous was 4.4.
ALT was 42, AST was 24, and her alkaline phosphatase was 253.
Glucose tolerance test was 59 (which was increased).
Her lipase was 74.
Total bilirubin was 0.4.
Serum osmolarity was 310.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone was 5.
Her lithium level was 1.5.
Urine creatinine was 53.
Her urine sodium was 24.
Urine osmolalities was 187.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray on [**10-28**] (since the previous study) revealed development of bilateral pulmonary congestion.
A chest x-ray from [**10-26**] showed an increased density in the left lower base.
Her lithium levels remained stable in the 1 to 1.5 range.
Serial lithium levels were monitored, and at the time of this dictation the last lithium level was 0.5.
The patient will have to have lithium levels monitored every four days after discharge to insure that the patient does not have toxic levels of lithium with her increased creatinine.
The patient was to be monitored for her lithium levels by her psychiatry physician as an outpatient.
