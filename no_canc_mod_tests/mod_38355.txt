CT head done showed blood inleft lateral ventricle and neurosurgery was called for consult.

Atherosclerosis of the right CCA and origin of the bilateral vertebral arteries but no significant stenosis.
MRI c-spine ([**2123-12-27**]) 1.
These findings are consistent with MRI findings from [**2123-12-27**].
0 to 40% stenosis in the right ICA  CT head ([**2123-12-29**]): Stable appearance of large intraventricular hemorrhage, with no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus or new bleed.
CTA chest ([**2123-12-29**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Given these findings, a repeat chest CT is recommended in 12 months in order to document stability.
CXR ([**2123-12-30**]): IMPRESSION: 1) Dense right lower lobe opacity and left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
3) Mild vascular congestion compatible with previous CT imaging.
CT Head ([**2123-12-30**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head ([**2124-1-1**]): Little change in size or extent of intraventricular hemorrhage.
CXR ([**2124-1-6**]): The current study demonstrates resolution of previously demonstrated pulmonary edema.
As compared to chest CT from [**2123-12-29**], the amount of the pleural effusion has substantially increased.
CT Head ([**2124-1-7**]): 1.
CXR ([**2124-1-8**]): Compared to the prior study there has been interval decrease in the bilateral pleural effusions.
A 10-mm opacity seen in the left mid lung that was not present on the film from two days prior or chest CT likely represents confluence of shadows but attention should be paid to this region on followup.
A Cervical MRI was obtained and ruled out ligamentous injury and his collar was removed on [**2123-12-28**].
On that morning he was alert but had emesis and went to CT for a repeat study which showed an increase in ventricular hemorrhage with extension to the right venticle.
CT on [**12-29**] was without change and he was trasnfered to the floor with Q2 hr neuro checks.
He had a repeat CT on [**2123-12-30**] which ruled out hydrocephalus prior to transfer to the medicine service.
Subsequent head CT on [**2124-1-7**], which was ordered because Mr. [**Known lastname **] complained of worsening headache, showed interval improvement of intraventricular hemorrhage.
We attempted to maintain his blood pressure below 160 given the bleed.
On exam he continued to have poor air entry and showed evidence of bibasilar consolidations.
He was subsequently transferred to the MICU and started on a Diltiazem drip, which effectively decreased his HR to the 70's.
His BP remained elevated, with SBP ranging from 120s up to 210s at one point.
#Carotid stenosis: MRA and carotid ultrasound was performed for syncope work up.
His abdominal exam remained benign with no rebound or tenderness.
Urinalysis was checked on [**1-11**] and was negative.
Urine and blood cultures were also sent at that time and were pending at time of discharge.
#Code status this admission: DNR, OK to intubate (confirmed with patient and daughter/HCP)  #Transitional Issues: -Goal systolic BP is 90-160, if SBP consistently >160, he will need uptitration of lisinopril or an additional antihypertensive -Pt will follow up with neurosurgery in one month, at which time CT scan of the head should be done and he should be considered for re-initiation of anti-coagulation therapy -Pt will follow up with vascular surgery regarding his carotid stenosis -Will need repeat CTA of neck in 1 month from discharge to reassess carotid stenosis -Control of his heart rate and atrial flutter should be re-evaluated as an outpatient, he may benefit from a A.flutter ablation once he is able to be anticoagulated -At discharge, he will remain on ASA 325mg daily but his warfarin has been stopped until he is seen by neurosurgery in follow-up -Lisinopril was changed to 10mg PO daily at discharge, this will need further titration at rehab according to his BP -Patient had urinary retention on day of discharge.
Last void with straight catheterization at approximately 4pm on [**1-11**].
We controlled your heart rate with medications and treated you for pneumonia with IV antibiotics.
Slowly we were able to control your heart rate and treat your infection and your condition improved.
