His FSG was 328 in field and VS on route were BP 168/92, 58 SR, 16, 97 RA, 99 on FM.
His exam stayed the same en route.
His NIHSS score at 6.10pm was 11, with points for right sided paralysis, right hemineglect, and visual neglect (versus field cut).
Exam notable for R sided visual, tactile neglect and no mvt at RUE or RLE, R facial droop, visual paralysis to the R side.

Further evaluation with [**Month/Year (2) 4338**] with diffusion- weighted imaging is recommended.
3D time-of-flight MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates diminished flow within the left middle cerebral artery compared to the flow on the right side.
Diminished flow within the left middle cerebral artery compared to the right on the MR angiogram images, suggestive of possible focal occlusions, embolic or thrombotic in nature.
ECHO [**1-9**]: Conclusions: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Repeat Head CT [**1-10**]: There is no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
New hypodensity in the posterior left temporal lobe is seen corresponding to the region of abnormal diffusion on the recent prior brain [**Month/Year (2) 4338**].
Limited assessment of the glenohumeral joint suggests that the joint is congruent, but if there is strong clinical suspicion for dislocation, then additional imaging would be recommended.
CT scan showed no hemorrhage, and the patient was considered to be a good candidate for the [**Last Name (un) **]-2 study protocol, which tests a new thrombolytic within a 9 hour window.
The MRA showed decreased flow signal in the distal M1 segment on the left MCA.
He was admitted to the neuro ICU for close post-lytic monitoring of blood pressure and vital signs.
Head CT repeated in 72 hours (or sooner if change in exam) and was stable.
ASA was started 24 hours after the study medication injection and afterward Aggrenox was added at 1 cap po qd x 3 days, followed by [**Hospital1 **] dosing to be taken after discharge.
