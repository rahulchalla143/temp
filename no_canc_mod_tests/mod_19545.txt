Initial CT scan diagnosed ileitis of the distal ileum, and she was treated with iv levofloxacin/metronidazole, and kept NPO.
Repeat CT showed improvement in inflammation, but she failed po trial, and continues to have nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
She developed a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, thought to be due to ongoing diarrhea.
TTG was 3, ANCA negative, stool cultures negative.

CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) NAUSEA/VOMITING: At OSH, pt had evidence of ileitis on CT scan.
Repeat CT here showed resolution of this.
In addition, a head CT was done to r/o intracranial mass lesion.
With this her rate was controlled and her rhthym was subsequently mostly sinus.
Last dig level was 1.4.
An echo was done which showed mild LVH with preserved EF.
8) ANEMIA: Iron studies consistent with ACD though level of anemia and lack of chronic inflammation made this unusual.
Her hct was variable between 24-30 but did not require any transfusions.
Stools were guiac negative and hemolysis labs were negative.
