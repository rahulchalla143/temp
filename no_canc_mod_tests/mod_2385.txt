ECHO [**2192-9-12**] There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal  (LVEF>55%).
[**9-19**] CT chest: As suggested on the prior chest radiographs, there are multiple linear opacities within the lung lobes, right greater than left consistent with atelectasis and/or scarring.
ABG on RA after pneumonia: was 7.40/41/54.
Dyspnea/Hypoxia- no organism identified in sputum at outside hospital, and a sputum was unable to be obtained here.
PA/LAT CXR showed a multilobar PNA.
Her WBC count decreased from around 20 at the OSH to about [**9-6**]; her dyspnea totally resolved however her hypoxia continued.
She remained on her home asthma medications although she never showed any signs of obstructive disease on CXR or exam.
An ABG on room air showed 7.40/41/54.
At this point the pulmonary consult team consulted and a Chest CT was obtained that showed diffuse scarring versus atelectasis.
A V/Q scan showed low-probability for PE.
Pulmonary consult felt that her hypoxia was due to shunt physiology and upon reviewing the CT scan felt her abnormal findings were most likely due to atelectasis.
It was additionally recommended that a echocardiogram with bubble study be performed in the future to evaluate for intracardiac shunt.
CHF - BNP of 8055, no echo in our system, negative cardiac cath 10 yrs ago.
Pt appears clinically euvolemic, had ECHO that showed preserved LVEF, with moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Her hypoxia did not improve with a trial of diuresis.
Given her hypoxia is thought to be from chronic underlying lung disease she is medically cleared to receive psychiatric treatment at this time with additional work-up/management as detailed above upon discharge  Medications on Admission: Transfer Meds: Tigecycline 50mg IV q12 Aztreonam 1 gm IV q12 Caspofungin 50mg daily Prednisone 5mg daily Prograf 5 mg po BID Protonix 40mg daily Lopressor 150mg [**Hospital1 **] Bactrim DS PO daily vitamin C 500mg daily Zocor 40mg MagO4 400mg TID Amlodipine 10mg daily Lovenox 30mg SQ Lantus 30 Units Ilotycin eye gtt Flovent 110mcg [**Hospital1 **] Xalatan eye qtt Alphagan eye qtt   Discharge Medications: 1.
