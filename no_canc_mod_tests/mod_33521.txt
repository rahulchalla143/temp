CT CHEST [**2125-8-27**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT CHEST [**2125-9-6**] CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: Since the prior CT, there has been placement of a right posterior pleural pigtail catheter which terminates in the major fissure at the base of the right lung.
In the bones, there are multiple anterior wedge deformities of T6, T7, T8, T9, and L1, all stable from [**2125-8-27**].
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW STUDY [**2125-10-18**]  This study was performed in conjunction with speech pathology department.
During initial nectar-thick administration in a more recumbent position, there was marked premature spillover and frank aspiration, which remained silent.
Cough reflex was inadequate in clearing the aspirated material.
Patient's O2 saturations were noted to transiently decrease during these episodes.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-8-10**], right ventricular cavity size is smaller and the severity of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation are reduced.

He was initially treated with Vancomycin, however, developed an exfoliative rash to this medication.
He was found to be unresponsive, with T = 92 degrees, BP 44/P, HR 82; he was intubated.
Nursing assessment at this time noted necrotic L toes, necrotic calcaneous, as well as having thick bloody secretions.
He underwent several speech and swallow evaluations and did not pass.
He had an ileus for approximately 5 days which prevented him from getting tube feeds.
He had marginal blood pressures and so was placed on a lasix drip.
A thoracentesis on [**2125-11-12**] was suggestive of empyema  Upper GU bleed: [**11-4**] stablized on proton pump inhibitor.
