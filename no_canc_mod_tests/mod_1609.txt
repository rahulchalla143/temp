Her initial electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in the inferior leads consistent with an acute inferior myocardial infarction.
Head computerized tomography scan showed intracranial hemorrhage primarily in the third and fourth ventricles extending into the lateral ventricles, resulting in mild hydrocephaly.
Intracranial pressure was monitored and on [**9-19**] with the intracranial pressure 1315, the ventriculoscopy drain was removed.
8 hours; Zocor 20 mg q. day  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, temperature 100.6, blood pressure 193/99, pulse 88, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 100% on FIO2 of 30%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Eyes closed, right eye externally deviated, minimally reactive to light.
Abdomen, soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10, hematocrit 33.6, platelets 296 with differential 78 neutrophils, 15 lymphocytes, 6 monocytes, sodium 136, potassium 4.0, chloride 104, bicarbonate 25, BUN 15, creatinine .6, glucose 131.
Calcium 9.1, magnesium 2.2, phosphorus 3.8, PT 12.7, PTT 23.7, INR 1.1.
Arterial blood gases, 7.48, 32, 121, 25 on 30% FIO2.
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the head on the day of discharge showed decreased blood and improved hydrocephalus.
The patient's blood pressures were closely monitored throughout the hospitalization, initially she was maintained on systolic blood pressure of 130 to 140 and then one week out from the bleed the blood pressure was further lowered in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction.
She continued to have a weak gag reflex although this did improve during the hospital course.
Her Metoprolol was tolerated up during the hospitalization as her blood pressure and heartrate tolerated.
Initial repeat electrocardiogram showed continued ST elevation in the inferior leads, however, this resolved over hospitalization.
Fever/meningitis - The patient presented following low-grade temperatures at the outside hospital where she was on Ancef.
Multiple blood, urine and sputum cultures were sent as was the urinalysis and chest x-ray.
Her sputum from [**9-20**] grew out sparse Klebsiella, however, the gram stain was negative.
A sputum from [**9-23**] again showed a sparse course of  a Klebsiella on her sputum culture along with sparse oropharyngeal Flora.
Given the sparse growth of organism it was thought that this was more likely a contaminate, particularly given the lack of significant chest x-ray changes.
She later had an lumbar puncture after approval for safety from Neurology which showed both red cells and white cells thought to be consistent with an inflammatory versus infectious process.
Anemia - Hematocrit was low on admission, thought to be due to intracranial hemorrhage, although baseline hematocrit was unknown.
Her hematocrit was followed throughout the hospitalization and remained stable.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient initially was NPO upon transfer from the outside hospital.
Her electrolytes were followed throughout the hospitalization.
Prophylaxis - The patient on Lansoprazole for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
Metoprolol 75 mg per nasogastric tube t.i.d., hold for systolic blood pressure less than 120 or heartrate less than 55.
t.i.d., hold for systolic blood pressure less than 120.
4 hours prn for systolic blood pressure greater than 145 7.
The patient is being discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital in [**Location (un) 38**], fax #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 10317**], phone #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 10318**].
