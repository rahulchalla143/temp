His EKG at that time showed sinus tachycardia with a rate of [**Street Address(2) 64158**] depressions in 1, 2, F and V4 through V6, elevations with T-wave inversions in V1 through V3.
His initial CK was 147 with a troponin of 0.08.
His cardiac catheterization revealed an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm squared and 3 vessel disease in LAD with 80% tubulo stenosis, circumflex with a mid vessel 70% stenosis, and an RCA with proximal 80% stenosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 97.9, heart rate 88, blood pressure 111/54, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturations 96% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORY DATA:  WBC 10.2, hematocrit 37.6, platelet count 196, PT 54, INR 1.1, sodium 142, potassium 4.1, chloride 103, CO2 16, BUN 20, creatinine 1.7, glucose 294.
Urinalysis has protein, otherwise negative.
EKG - sinus rhythm with normal intervals.
Chest x-ray - hyperinflated lung fields with moderate congestive heart failure, no effusions or consolidations.
Following cardiac catheterization the patient underwent carotid studies which showed less than 40% narrowing bilaterally.
At the time of transfer he was in sinus rhythm at 82 beats per minute with mean arterial pressure of 80.
During that period the patient had frequent burst of rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 120 to 140.
An attempt again was made to cardiovert the patient following which he had short periods of sinus rhythm but then generally returned to atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 120 to 130.
The patient again became agitated and dyspneic, however he maintained his oxygen saturations with minimal ventilatory support.
He was placed on Precedex infusion following which a neuro examination was performed with his Greek speaking nephew in attendance.
His chest tubes and temporary pacing wires were removed, however he was maintained on cardiothoracic intensive care unit for 2 additional days to monitor his pulmonary status.
At the time of this dictation the patient's physical examination was as follows:  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.7, heart rate 97, in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 124/52, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturations 96% on 2 liters nasal prongs.
His weight at the time of discharge was 77.3 kilos.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell 8.0, hematocrit 35.8, platelet count 290, sodium 143, potassium 4.6, chloride 107, CO 325, BUN 45, creatinine 1.1, glucose 116.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of    1.7.
