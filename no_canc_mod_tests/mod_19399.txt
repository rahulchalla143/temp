Transmitral Doppler E>A and TDI E/e' <8 suggesting normal diastolic function, and normal LV filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
On admission patient was found to be in normal sinus tachycardia with a leukocytosis of 24.3.
EKG was unremarkable.
Chest CXR showed a right basilar consolidation and bibasilar atelectasis.
EKG, cardiac enzymes and ECHO were unremarkable.
Patient remained in normal sinus tachycardia with heart rates in low 100's.
Blood cultures were drawn and eventually grew 1 of 4 bottles with gram positive cocci (being speciated).
TIP cultures have been negative to date.
Sputum cultures show Gram negative rods.
CT scan of sinuses were also obtained and showed opacification consistent with sinusitis.
ENT service was consulted and sinus aspirate was obtained, with cultures also showing Gram negative rods.
During this hospitalization, patient was continued on Vancomycin and Zosyn and Gentamycin was added for double Gram negative rod coverage.
