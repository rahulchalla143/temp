Subarachnoid hemorrhage is also seen in the right temporal area (series 2, image 5; series 401b, images 15, 20, 44).
CT of the temporal bones and skull base can provide further evaluation.
Two partly calcified subcutaneous nodules as described above..  CT C-Spine [**3-14**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Skull fractures with one extending to the base, and horizontal fracture of the right temporal bone and pneumocephalus, please refer to the head CT from earlier today.
Head CT [**3-15**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRA Head [**3-16**]: IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.
MRI Head [**3-16**]: FINDINGS: Correlation was made with the CT examination of [**2193-3-15**].
There are bilateral small subdurals identified at the parietal occipital region measuring not more than 3 mm in width and are not seen on the previous CT in retrospect.
For evaluation of fractures correlate with previous CT findings.
EKG [**3-14**]: Sinus rhythm.
Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 77	138	92	372/401	66	0	20  EEG [**3-15**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of focal slow transients involving the left anterior to mid-temporal region; this abnormality typically correlates with an area of subcortical dysfunction.
Cardiac Echo [**3-15**]: Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Carotid Duplex Study [**3-15**]: Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 54/14, 95/27, 100/33 cm/sec.
CCA peak systolic velocity is 77 cm/sec.
ECA peak systolic velocity is 85 cm/sec.
On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 98/26, 96/27, 81/19 cm/sec.
CCA peak systolic velocity is 86 cm/sec.
ECA peak systolic velocity is 80 cm/sec.
Bilateral carotid duplex, and TTE were performed and found to be negative in causation of syncopal event.
