Cardiology Service followed the patient and adjusted medications for volume overload and blood pressure management.
The patient was discharged to rehabilitation on [**11-2**] with an amputation scheduled for [**11-20**] at [**Hospital1 69**].
At the rehabilitation facility ([**Location (un) **]), on the day of admission, the patient complained of shortness of breath with an oxygen saturation of 75% on room air which increased to 90% with 2 liters nasal cannula.
There was also a question of low blood pressures, and the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital where oxygen saturations were noted to be 79% on room air, which improved to 93% with 2 liters; however, the respiratory rate was 34.
The patient's blood pressure was noted to be 134/72, but then dropped to 70/palpable, and the patient was noted to hypothermic with a temperature of 95.4.
A chest x-ray performed at the outside facility showed questionable right upper lobe consolidation and congestive heart failure.
The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room with continued shortness of breath and an oxygen saturation of 86% to 100% on 4 liters which improved to 98%.
The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate into the 110s and 120s and a blood pressure of 100/60 which dropped to 84/56.
At approximately 1:30 in the morning, the patient was started on Levophed 2 mcg/min with an increase in blood pressure to 99/65.
The patient's temperature was 96.6.
In the Emergency Department, the patient became more alert with an elevation of her blood pressure as the patient was able to speak in full sentences as opposed to one-word answers, and a noted right eyelid drop had resolved at this time.
Blood cultures were drawn after the initiation of antibiotics.
The patient's heart rate was noted to become elevated into the 150s in the Emergency Department; and, therefore, intravenous Cardizem 5 mg was given times two with a decrease in heart rate to the 120s to 130s.
Echocardiogram in [**2140-1-15**] showed left atrial dilatation with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of 20% to 25%, with global hypokinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, 1+ aortic regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Temperature was 96.6 rectally, heart rate was 122 (in atrial fibrillation), blood pressure was 122/76 (which decreased to 84/56), oxygen saturation was 94% on 4 liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round and reactive to light.
Cardiovascular examination revealed irregularly irregular and tachycardic.
The chest revealed decreased breath sounds at the right base with crackles halfway up bilaterally.
Extremity examination revealed necrotic right toes with dressing in place and pneumatic boots on.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 10 (with a differential of 89 polys, 3 bands, 6 lymphocytes, and 2 monocytes), hematocrit was 43.6, and platelets were 138.
Prothrombin time was 15.5, INR was 1.6, and partial thromboplastin time was 34.8.
Sodium was 140, potassium was 4.4, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 65, creatinine was 1.3, and blood glucose was 100.
Calcium was 9.5, magnesium was 2, and phosphate was 5.1.
Urinalysis revealed 0 to 2 red blood cells, 0 white blood cells, no bacteria or yeast.
Urine culture was pending.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed right effusion with mild congestive heart failure, middle right upper lobe consolidation with questionable left retrocardiac consolidation.
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 118, left axis deviation, with a left bundle-branch block, ST elevations of 1 mm in leads V2, ST depressions of 1 mm in V5 through V6 (which were slightly more pronounced than prior electrocardiograms).
The patient's hypotension improved to a systolic blood pressure of 100s to 120s.
Once the patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit (on [**2140-11-19**]), it was unclear what the patient's intravascular volume status was given evidence of rales on pulmonary examination and elevated jugular venous pressure; however, a fractional secretion of sodium was found to be less than 1%, and the patient was complaining of thirst.
Unfortunately, the catheter was unable to wedge; and, therefore, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were unable to be obtained.
The catheter readings did show a cardiac index of 0.8 to 1.1, and a central venous pressure of 12 to 16, and elevated pulmonary artery pressures of 50/20, and a systemic vascular resistance of 2424 to 3677.
A trial of diuresis was given with Lasix with a good response in urine output.
However, on [**11-27**], diuresis had to be held since the patient's systolic blood pressure became borderline hypotensive at 96.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was noted to have a multilobar pneumonia on chest x-ray as well as a right gangrenous leg.
The patient's blood cultures were negative to date.
The patient remained afebrile, and her white blood cell count remained stable.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient was noted to have a right large pleural effusion on chest x-ray which was stable from a prior chest x-ray in [**2140-10-16**].
Therefore, a thoracentesis was not done for diagnostic purposes in the patient.
A chest computed tomography was done which revealed a large right pleural effusion, and moderate left pleural effusion, with a small pericardial effusion, and less than 3-mm nodules in the lung parenchyma.
However, since thoracentesis could not be pursued in this patient, there was no reason to pursue a further workup of malignancy.
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient was continued on a regular insulin sliding-scale, and her fingersticks were checked on a q.i.d.
