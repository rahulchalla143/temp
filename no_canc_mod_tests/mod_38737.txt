NCHCT was negative for acute process and she was admitted for hyponatremia.
Subsequent MRI showed a R sided thalamic stroke.
Repeat MRI was performed which the daughter believes was non-conclusive and she does not recall hearing a final read on that study.
Discharge summary states MRI with contrast showed acute/subacute infarct of R hemisphere involving entire PCA territory and posterior aspect of the MCA territory, moderate diffuse atrophy and periventricular gliosis.
Multiple EEG studies were performed which were concerning for continued epileptiform focus in the R occipital lobe and epilepsy partialis continua.
Last Depakote level on [**9-1**] was therapeutic at 96.
PLT were 177 at admission on [**8-27**] and dropped to 55 on day of transfer.
She apparently had evidence of gastritis on EGD in the setting of PEG placement.
Nephrology was also consulted and she was transfused 1u PRBCs to improve her oncotic pressure (last albumin 2.2).
Strength 3/5 in LUE, [**3-13**] in RUE/RLE, 3+/5 in LLE.
Patellar DTR 1+ on L, 2+ on R. Sensation grossly intact to light touch throughout.

Although encephalopathies may obscure focal findings, there was focal slowing on this EEG, suggesting a focal subcortical dysfunction or possibly lesion in the right posterior quadrant.
There were frequent focal sharp waves and spikes in the same area, raising the possibility of an area of focal epileptogenesis, but no actual seizures were recorded.
[**2108-9-10**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 1.
[**9-12**]: Echo No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
[**9-14**]: right upper extremity DVT scan: -clot noted in basilic vein(prelim read)   Brief Hospital Course: 78F with HTN, bipolar disorder, recent CVA with residual L hemiparesis and unclear seizure disorder who is transferred for possible plasmapheresis in the setting of thrombocytopenia believed to be heparin-induced.
TTP was thought to be unlikely due to lack of shisctocytes on blood smear and no evidence of hemolysis.
Fibrinogen level was sent to help rule out DIC, although again, clinical suspicion for low.
Her plt count continued to improve and on discharge was normal (156).
HIT abs test was equivocal and a seratonin release assay was sent(pending).
PLEASE CHECK CBC BIWEEKLY FOR 2 WEEKS AT REHAB, IF STABLE THEN DECREASE TO DAILY.
Echo was neg for embolic source and carotid ultrasound showed 40% stenosis.
EEG showed general slowing with some sharp spikes, but no clear seizure activity.
Discharge Instructions: You had a recent stroke and to prevent blood clots you were put on heparin.
There was a concern that may have caused your platelet count to drop(heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) and you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up.
Your platelet count improved to the normal range during your hospitalization.
