She went to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where she was found to be hyponatremic (128), have a CK of 2500, MB 99 (MBI 3.9) and troponin T of .12.
BNP was >6000.
EKG showed LVH with lat/inf ST depressions as well as evidence of left main disease.
A cortisol stimulation test did not bump appropriately and she was started on hydrocortisone/ fludrocortisone.
Troponin peaked at 1.61.
Pulmonary hypertension (moderate) 7.
Restrictive lung disease, +/- obstructive component 8.
Goiter (non-toxic) 9. h/o airway obstruction   Social History: Lives independently.

Scooped ST depressions noted in I, II, F, V4-V6 with elevations in R and V1.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2154-4-24**]) The estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is an echo-lucency (3mm) seen in tha basal infero-septum and inferior wall that is suggestive of a small diverticulum (there is no color flow to suggest a small VSD or intra-myocardial coronary bridge but thesse cannot be excluded).
1+ MR.  CXR ([**2154-4-23**]): Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS ([**2154-4-23**]): There is a 4.9 x 3.3 cm heterogeneous mass in the right lobe of the thyroid gland causing some displacement of the esophagus and the trachea across the midline.
Lung windows show some patchy scattered nodular infiltrates which may represent infectious process or atelectasis.
Oral contrast was not used for this study limiting evaluation of bowel loops but no gross abnormalities are seen.
CT HEAD ([**2154-4-23**]): There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
MRI and MRA of the head showed nothing acute to account for this and MRI of the c-spine only showed some stenosis.
A lumbar puncture was done under fluroscopy which did not show any cytoalbuminogenic dissociation, so [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **] was thought less likely.
Repeat EMG on HD 17 was also non-diagnostic.
CT chest was done to look for evidence of malignancy (?
CAD- EKG on admission showed left main disease (ST elevations in avr, V1, V2).
Her enzymes were positive with peak troponin to >1.6 with a positive MB index.
Echo was initially hyperdynamic but echo on HD 8 showd new inferior and inferoseptal wall motion abnormalities.
Pt'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and HCTZ were held in the initial setting of hypotension and then held as other agents were thought to be medically superior.
CK and MBs did not elevate but troponin was (?
Hematuria- On HD 16, pt had a large amount of hematuria requiring a 3 way foley/ bladder irrigation.
Urology was consulted who aided in management and urine cytology was also sent off.
On otoscopic exam with impacted cerumen.
Access- RIJ removed [**5-14**], PIVs x 2.

Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) teaspoon PO BID (2 times a day).
Carbamide Peroxide 6.5 % Drops [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 5-10 Drops Otic [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) for 2 days.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe [**Hospital1 **]: 0.5 mg Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1.
