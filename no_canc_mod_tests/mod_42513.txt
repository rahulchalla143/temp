Pericardiocentesis 2.
Upon arrival, bedside echo revealed a large pericardial effusion without tamponade.
Pulsus was 30 so she proceeded with pericardiocentesis this afternoon.
Vitals this morning are 105/73 105 92% on RA.
SBP was 120 when doing pulsus.
Pericardiocentesis removed 520cc of bloody fluid.
Echo done after the procedure revealed a thick pericardium but no residual effusion.
Right atrial pressures were also elevated and decreased but were still high at the end of the procedure.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 5 cm.

CHEST CT [**10-8**] 1.
CTA [**2132-10-9**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Moderate-sized left pleural effusion, trace right pleural effusion, and large pericardial effusion are unchanged since the chest CT performed yesterday.
ECHO [**2132-10-9**] The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
ECHO [**2132-10-10**] IMPRESSION: Large circumferential pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of impaired ventricular filling.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-10-9**], there is evidence of impaired ventricular filling.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-10-11**], the findings are similar.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-10-11**] the findings are similar  PERICARDIAL AND PLEURAL FLUID WERE NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS  Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo female with history of breast cancer and prior pericardial effusion in [**2125**] who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] with large pericardial effusion and tamponade after two weeks of fever and viral illness.
When the patient's output from the drain slowed down, the drain was pulled.
A repeat TTE done after pulling the pericardial drain showed that there was no significant re-accumulation of pericardial effusion.
The patient was also instructed to get an echocardiogram of the heart two weeks after discharge.
PERICARDIAL AND PLEURAL FLUID WERE NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS .
# pleural effusion:  The patient has evidence of pleural effusion on CXR and ECHO.
She is s/p thoracentesis [**2132-10-12**], taking off ~600cc of blood tinged, clear pleural fluid.
Moreover, patient denied any infectious symptoms besides dry cough and because of this, no antibiotics were started; upon discharge, the all blood cultures were no growth to date and the patient remained afebrile.
The patient's pressures were well controlled while in the CCU, and her metoprolol was uptitrated because of her elevated heart rates.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having some soreness with breathing, and echocardiogram of your heart showed that you had some fluid in the bag that is surrounding your heart.
A repeat echocardiogram showed that the fluid did not reaccumulate.
You will need to get an echocardiogram of your heart in two weeks.
