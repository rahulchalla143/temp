COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from same date, chest radiograph from [**2144-8-8**], chest CT from [**2144-8-5**].
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images of the chest were obtained before and after administration of IV contrast as per routine pulmonary embolism protocol.
FINDINGS: CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The non-contrast CT demonstrates no intramural hematoma within the aorta.
CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no filling defect in the pulmonary arterial tree to suggest the present of a pulmonary embolism.
Compared to the prior CT, nodes are smaller and likely relate to resolving pneumonia.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

TTE Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2132-11-20**], the severity of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation have increased slightly.
CXR Final Report REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient with parenchymal opacities.
PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to multiple prior studies dating back to [**2144-8-3**].
There is gradual improvement up to practically complete resolution of bilateral right more than left opacities with only minimal left basilar opacity seen on the current study and that might represent area of lingular atelectasis.
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position.
Available for comparison is the next previous PA and lateral chest examination obtained one day earlier.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern5) 3250**] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 3251**] Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2144-8-27**] 5:54 PM    Imaging Lab    Brief Hospital Course: 47F with remote h/o asthma p/w progressive SOB/DOE, pleuritic CP, fatigue, and hypoxia with eosinophilia after recent admission for pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin now with resolved infiltrates.
CXR and CTA chest showed no significant infiltrate, PE, or other parenchymal lung disease, which was markedly improved from her last recent CT which showed multifocal PNA.
She had peripheral eos of 25, which resolved for one day after ED gave 1x steroids due to concern for asthma flare.
Otherwise, ABG 7.38/44/66 was drawn on room air with A-A gradient 28, suggesting either a V/Q mismatch, diffusion abnormality, or shunt.
An acute diffusion gradient etiology is less likely given CT chest without significant pathology, although given peripheral eosinophilia, AEP/CEP was thought to be a possibility.
Her pleuritic CP was most consistent with an inflammatory vs post-infectious cause as CTA did not show PE.
She received albuterol and ipratropium nebs and her sats improved to room air without desats while walking.
TTE showed mild/mod TR worsened from before but normal EF.
Pulmonary team recommended spirometry and they initially felt it was unclear if peripheral eosinophilia is related to pulmonary process but rapid response of eos as well as infiltrates suggest may be related.
Her bronch fluid notably showed 30-40% eos.
She had blood tests sent for aspergillous galactomannan antibody and IgE were sent and are pending.
She will have review of her lung biopsies at that time as well.
Disp:*qs 21 days * Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: chronic eosinophilic pneumonia .
You had a bronchoscopy performed which showed mucous secretions, and biopsies/fluid samples were obtained.
