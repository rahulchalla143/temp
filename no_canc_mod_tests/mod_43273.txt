A toxicology screen of her urine was positive for benzodiazepines, cocaine, narcotics, and methadone.
Urinalysis also showed likely infection.
She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
At this point, her CT scan had been read as negative, and she had been seen by both the Stroke and Neurological Services who felt that she was not suffering from either an acute seizure or an acute stroke.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.1?????
?, heart rate 87, blood pressure 148/83, oxygen saturation 97% on 40% FI02.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheezing.
There were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
A full neurological exam was unable to be performed secondary to sedation.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 5.6, 46% neutrophils, 45% lymphs, 6% monos, hemoglobin 14, hematocrit 41.1, platelet count 255; sodium 138, potassium 4.1, chloride 97, bicarb 29, BUN 14, creatinine 1.1, glucose 104; ALT 17, AST 27, alkaline phosphatase 190, amylase 77, lipase 33, total bilirubin 0.2; INR 1.2, PT 13, PTT 27; calcium 9.5, magnesium 2.2, phosphorus 5.5; troponin less than 0.3, CK 106; urine toxicology screen showed benzodiazepines, cocaine, narcotic, Methadone; serum toxicology screen was negative; urinalysis showed nitrite positive, pH of 5.5, trace leukocyte esterase, [**5-2**] whites, many bacteria; ................... less than 1, Dilantin level 15.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 83, 0.5-1.
[**Street Address(2) 103493**] depressions in II, III, and AVF, with T-wave inversions in the same leads, biphasic T-waves in V5 and V6, compared an electrocardiogram of [**2100-11-23**].
Chest x-ray was clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for careful monitoring status post overdose presumed secondary to narcotics.
She was seen by Neurology and the Stroke Team who felt that this was unlikely to represent either ................. or stroke given the findings on CT scan and her abrupt resolution of symptoms with the administration of Narcan.
Given the cocaine in her urine toxicology screen and minimal ST depressions on electrocardiogram, she was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
She had serial cardiac enzymes which were negative including troponin I and CK.
Upon admission, she had a urinalysis which was consistent with infection and received Bactrim double strength for five days for this.
A urine culture grew out two colonial morphologies of gram-negative rods.
She did have a white count shortly after admission of 15 and low-grade temperatures to approximately 100.4??????.
It was felt that this temperature and white count was either likely due to an exacerbation of her urinary tract infection or a small aspiration pneumonitis.
There was no evidence on a repeat chest film of severe pneumonitis or pneumonia.
She did state that she had a history of emphysema for which she has not been treated, and chest x-ray showed some nodularity in the periphery which can be consistent with talc granulomatosis secondary to heroine use.
