Electrocardiogram was without evidence of ST segment elevations.
Initial cardiac enzymes were negative on admission, however, now were significant for troponin-T elevation from 0.54 to 0.85.
Echocardiogram was performed, and patient was found to have ejection fraction of 25%, PA systolic pressure of 58, which is elevated and a new 4+ mitral regurgitation.
In the Catheterization Laboratory, angiography revealed a 90% stenosis of proximal saphenous vein graft to his right coronary artery, and 80% stenosis of his distal LIMA.
Patient has also had a catheterization in [**2122-1-20**] showing patent grafts with 50% touchdown of LIMA occlusion.
Echocardiogram [**2124-7-19**] shows ejection fraction of 25%, mitral regurgitation 4+, tricuspid regurgitation 3+, akinetic left ventricular wall motion and dilated RV.
EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO CCU:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.0, blood pressure 95/39, heart rate 68, respiratory rate 20, 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula, PA diastolic pressure was 10.
Extremities:  Pulses 2+, no edema and right femoral line placed.
On admission to the CCU, patient's chest x-ray showed pulmonary vascular congestion.
Patient was initially on a high O2 requirement requiring a nonrebreather face mask, however, patient was diuresed and afterload reduced, patient's O2 requirement decreased and eventually the patient was 100% on room air.
In terms of the patient's renal function, his creatinine was elevated to 2.2 on admission to the CCU with afterload reduction, increased perfusion of the kidneys, and appropriate diuresis, patient's creatinine trended down to 1.6 and is currently improving.
Her urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrates.
Patient will not be started on antibiotics unless urine culture is positive.
Urine culture is currently pending.
Repeat echocardiogram showed dilated left atrium with diameter of 5.7 cm.
Left ventricular wall showed basal and mid inferior akinesis, dilated RV and LV which was larger than on previous examination, 4+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation without significant change, and an ejection fraction of 20-25%.
Patient has had diagnosis of gout in the past, and has been treated successfully with Indocin, however, at the time of treatment, the patient's kidney function was not at baseline, therefore nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories cannot be initiated.
Renal:  Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase or nitrate.
Patient's creatinine has decreased from 2.2 to 1.6 currently and is currently trending down.
The patient will be scheduled for an echocardiogram prior to his Cardiology follow-up appointment.
