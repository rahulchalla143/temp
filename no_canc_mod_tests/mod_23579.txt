In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.6 P 106 BP 137/93 R 28 O2 sat 100%.
CXR was difficult to interpret, so the patient had a CTA - there was no e/o PE, but a LLL opacity was noted.
Prior to transfer, vitals: P 93 BP 135/106 RR 21 O2sat 100% on 35% trach mask.

There was a suggestion of chronic atelectasis in that portion of the lung on a read from an old CT from [**Hospital1 2025**], however not having seen that scan, and given the severity of Mr. [**Known lastname 86060**] underlying lung disease and lack of any pulmonary reserve, we chose to initiate treatment.
Sputum cultures were sent and contaminated.
Vanc and cefepime were chosen for a 14 day outpatient course after looking at the sensitivites of prior sputum cx from [**Hospital1 2025**].
Of note, chest CT did suggest some component of pulmonary edema as contributing to the new respiratory difficulties.
An echo was unable to visualize the right heart well, unfortunately.
EF was >55%.
Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome: Rare connective tissue disorder and osteolytic syndrome, with characteristic facies, skull deformities, osteoporosis, joint laxity, short stature, dissolution of distal phalanges.
