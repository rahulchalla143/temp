CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2153-3-26**] 12:22 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
Graft patency is not assessed without intravenous contrast.
EEG [**2153-4-11**] ROUTINE SAMPLING: The background is still low voltage and slow reaching up to a maximum of 7 Hz with reactivity, which is a mild improvement compared to the previous day's recording.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
The background showed reactivity, but was again slow and disorganized reaching up to a maximum of 7 Hz, which is a mild improvement compared to the previous day's recording.
