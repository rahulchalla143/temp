On electrocardiogram at the time of admission she had marked ST elevations of 5 cm in V3 through V6.
She was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on [**10-7**] which revealed angiographically normal coronary arteries.
Her left ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 35% of unknown origin although the patient has a history of viral myocarditis at age 11.
The patient had multiple echocardiograms during her admission which showed an ejection fraction of around 20 to 22% with severe global hypokinesis and a normal left ventricular size, also 3+ tricuspid regurgitation.
She had a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen which showed free air as well as free fluid in the abdominal cavity.
On [**10-18**], her sputum culture revealed 2+ Senna Trepomonas which was Levofloxacin sensitive as well as 2+ yeast.
They did more sputum cultures on [**10-22**] and then she grew out Senna Trepomonas as well as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
On [**10-23**], her Clostridium difficile toxin was positive and she was treated with a course of Flagyl.
Cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 22%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on [**2164-10-8**], at the time of admission revealed the patient was afebrile, pulse was 85, her blood pressure was 117/62, she was sating 96% on room air.
Neck had a jugulovenous pressure of 6.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities:  She had no edema and 2+ pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs at the time of admission included a white count of 21.9, hematocrit 49.6, platelets 567.
Chem-7 Sodium was 129, potassium 3.1, chloride 85, bicarbonate 19, BUN 52, creatinine 4.1 and glucose 111.
Calcium was 6.5, magnesium 1.3, CK 509, trended down to 350.
Her chest x-ray was negative.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus with a rate of 100, left axis deviation, ST elevations inferiorly as well as V3 through V6 of up to [**Street Address(2) 32524**] depression V1 through V2.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25%, severe global hypokinesis, decreased left ventricular function and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
She had a pulse of 79, blood pressure 100/56 sating 100% on a ventilator set with pressure support of 18 and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, FIO2 40%.
Her labs at the time of transfer to us were white count 17.4 which was trending down from 22.5.
Her hematocrit was 29.3, platelets 350, sodium 134, potassium 4.3, chloride 99, bicarbonate 27, BUN 38, creatinine 0.8, glucose 128, calcium 8.5, phosphorus 3.0 and magnesium 2.2.
Her micro-data summarized for hospital course, basically all her blood cultures were negative.
She had cultures done [**10-7**] times two, [**10-17**] times three, [**10-18**] times two, [**10-20**] times two and [**11-8**] times three.
Her sputum cultures as in history of present illness on [**10-18**] grew Senna Trepomonas sensitive to Levofloxacin and yeast.
[**10-21**] was normal oropharyngeal Flora, [**10-22**] was Senna Trepomonas Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, [**11-4**] Senna Trepomonas Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, [**11-8**] she had 2+ gram negative rods and 1+ gram positive cocci.
Urine cultures had evidence of yeast and her stool was positive for Clostridium difficile on [**10-23**], negative for Clostridium difficile times five on all other testings.
Pleural fluid samples on [**10-19**] had polys no organisms, on [**11-3**] had neither polys nor organisms.
It was decided that after the tracheostomy the patient would need time to let that heal so it was decided to just continue the tube feeds and let her have a swallow evaluation and otorhinolaryngology evaluation after discharge to a rehabilitation facility.
After tracheostomy was placed, we checked mechanics, her NIF was 10, her vital capacity was 750, title volume 400 and her RISB was 42.5.
Cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 22% 3.
