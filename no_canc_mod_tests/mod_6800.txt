The patient is status post left anterior descending interventions, i.e., repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the past, who was referred for a cardiac catheterization due to recurrent exertional chest pain.
He underwent an exercise treadmill test on [**2124-7-12**], which revealed that, after five minutes of exercise on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol, he complained of shortness of breath, calf claudication, and had significant electrocardiogram changes.
Electrocardiogram had inferolateral ST changes.
On [**2124-7-18**], he had cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 190**], where he was found to have an 80% ostial left anterior descending lesion.
His ejection fraction was noted to be 65% at that time.
Other angiography revealed diffuse disease in the distal left anterior descending up to 80% after the origin of the D2.
In [**2125-6-16**], he underwent another re-look catheterization because of again anteroseptal and apical ischemia noted on his surveillance treadmill test.
He was referred for repeat catheterization and possible coronary artery bypass graft due to this problem, and was ultimately referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**].
LABORATORY DATA:  CBC on [**2125-11-6**] revealed a white count of 7,000, hematocrit 42.6, platelet count 204,000.
INR .88, BUN and creatinine of 19 and 0.7.
He ultimately underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2125-11-8**] showing severe in-stent restenosis in the ostial left anterior descending stent, as well as moderate left circumflex and posterior descending artery disease, with low normal left ventricular ejection fraction, estimated to be 40 to 50%.
His pericardium was left open.
His diet was advanced as tolerated, and his postoperative hematocrit was noted to be 27.3, with a BUN and creatinine of 17 and 0.6.
His chest tubes were shortly thereafter discontinued.
He was in sinus in the 80s, with a blood pressure of 110/80.
Discharge temperature is 99.7, heart rate 60s and sinus, blood pressure 100/50, breathing at a rate of 20, room air saturation 94%.
His heart sounds were regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2.
Otherwise his dressings on the inferior portion of the wound were clean, dry and intact.
