Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service [**2146-9-14**] for further evaluation of pancreatitis and a pseudocyst after undergoing a failed ERCP.
The ERCP demonstrated severe edema of the distal stomach and bulb causing narrowing with a spontaneous drainage of pruluent material from the bulb, most likely due to a large pseudocyst or fluid collection.
Routine labwork, CXR, and ECG were performed.
Admission Abdominal/pelvic CT demonstrated findings consistent with pancreatitis with note a pseudocyst.
The study also showed mild intrahepatic biliary dilation, inflammation of the duodenum and CBD, as well as raised suspicion for SMV thrombosis.
A CTA pancreas protocol was perfomed on [**2146-9-17**], which redemonstrated pancreatitis with numerous adjacent air and fluid filled pseudocysts, as well as a filling defect of the  upper portion of the SMV, consistent with SMV thrombosis.
A hematocrit was 15.7 down from 28.6 four days prior.
Abdominal/pelvic CT revealed an overall stable appearance of the abdomen and pelvis with persistent small fluid collection tracking lateral to the duodenum/posterior to the pancreatic head and small probable hepatic subcapsular fluid collection.
The PICC was discontinued on [**2146-10-9**] and the tip sent for culture for a temperature spike.
PICC tip culture was negative.
He was also started on IV Reglan to improve his GI motility.
On [**2146-10-19**], he underwent PTC evaluation in IR, which demonstrated no evidence of ductal dilatation, again with long area of narrowing in the lower CBD likely related to mass effect from edema.
CXR revealed a marked increase in the extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion, with the effusion occupying about one-half of the right hemithorax.
Chest CT demonstrated a large multiloculated right pleural effusion, compressive atelectasis and patchy ground-glass opacities.
On [**2146-10-21**], the patient initially underwent an unsuccessful thoracentesis attempt of the right side, followed by a successful right video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) decortication of loculated right pleural effusion (See Operative Notes for full details).
Tachypneic overnight, ABG 7.41/51/107, CXR stable.
On [**2146-10-26**], the culture of the pleural tissue returned with pan-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii complex; Flagyl was added to Cipro for more comprehensive gram negative coverage.
On [**2146-10-27**], a CXR revealed a minimal decrease of the right pleural fluid with minimally improved transparency of the right-sided lung parenchyma.
