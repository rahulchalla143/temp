In the ED, initial vitals were T 105.4, HR 110, BP 120/57, RR 18, satting 100% RA.
Labs were notable for hct of 31 (at baseline) with white count of 3.2 (slightly lower than baseline), 92.9% polys with no bands.
Electrolytes were notable for BUN 31, creat 1.5 (both at baseline).
Glucose was 270.
Lactate was 1.6.
UA showed [**12-13**] whites, few bacteria, and trace LE.
CXR showed no infiltrate.
Blood cultures were drawn and urine culture sent.
Once in the ICU, the patient remained stable, with heart rate in high 80s and stable blood pressure.
Ultimately her urine and blood grew E-coli sensitive to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins.

CXR initially raised concern for a possible LLL infiltrate; oblique films were requested for better definition and showed no evidence of PNA.
Blood cultures were drawn.
Her WBC increased from 3.2 to 5.8 and she was transferred to the floor on the evening after admission.
She became afebrile and abx were changed to IV cipro and then PO cipro when urine culture came back negative.
It was believed that pt probably had a urinary tract infection sensitive to cipro which is why urine culture was negative as pt had taken one dose of cipro prior to presenting to ED.
# Type I diabetes: Pt became hyperglycemia the morning of admission with glucose of 491.
Under [**Last Name (un) **] guidance ISS and basal insulin were slowly uptitrated although pt continued to have difficult to control blood sugars into the 300s to the day of discharge.
Later in admission pt had issues with her baseline orthostatic hypotension with some blood pressures falling to 70s/40s when she stood up.
Hematocrit was at baseline.
She received 5L IVF and her UOP was ~150cc/h.
Cyclosporine level was check and found to be 89.

Your urine culture was negative, likely because you had taken antibiotics before coming to the hospital.
