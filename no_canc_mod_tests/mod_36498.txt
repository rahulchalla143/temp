The patient was found to have a blood pressure of 70/palpable, heart rate 86.
She received an abdominal CT that was unremarkable and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the MICU, the patient had a blood pressure of 95/40 on 15 micrograms of dopamine, a pulse in the 90s, saturating 100% on 50% face mask, temperature 99.5.
The patient's skin was remarkable for a very striking yellow-green color.
The patient's rectal examination was heme-negative.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 136, potassium 2.9, chloride 98, bicarbonate 24, BUN 27, creatinine 0.8.
She had a white count of 32.6 with a differential of 76 neutrophils, 9 bands, 10 lymphocytes, hematocrit 35.5, and platelets 185,000.
Her AST was 832, ALT 1,178, alkaline phosphatase 28, amylase 194, lipase 1,295.
Her ammonia level was 51, albumin 1.6.
Her total bilirubin was 21.9.
INR 1.16.
The patient's blood gas revealed a pH of 7.41, PC02 37, P02 87 on 50% face mask with a lactate of 2.1 and an ionized calcium of 0.97.
None of her cultures while she was in the Intensive Care Unit the first time were positive.
The patient's pain initially resolved and the patient was much improved with stable blood pressures and tolerating p.o.
The patient had difficulty with potassium homeostasis on the floor and a rising white blood cell count; however, minimal abdominal pain and only low-grade temperatures.
Given the increasing white blood cell count, the patient underwent repeat abdominal CT which showed a large pancreatic pseudocyst.
The patient remained afebrile but did have blood cultures drawn from her Porta-Cath turn positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus 48 hours after they were drawn.
Given the positive blood culture and the rising white blood cell count, the attending wished to have the patient's pseudocyst drained which was done in Interventional Radiology on [**2142-11-18**].
Gram stain from the drainage of the pseudocyst was negative for organisms.
Unfortunately, the patient's white count continued to rise and her hematocrit began to drop initially from 27.1 down to 24.1.
The patient was Guaiac negative from below.
The patient's hematocrit dropped as low as 20 and she was given multiple units of packed red blood cells.
The patient had a diagnostic paracentesis due to concern of bleeding into her peritoneum secondary to the pseudocyst drainage; however, this revealed no white blood cells, minimal red blood cells, and no organisms.
The patient's white count continued to climb and her belly became more distended and tender.
Unfortunately, the patient also developed increasing coagulopathy and her BUN and creatinine began to rise.
