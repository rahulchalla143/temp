In the Emergency Department the patient had an nasogastric lavage that demonstrated coffee ground emesis that cleared after 250 cc.
The patient's blood pressure transiently dropped to a systolic of 80, this pressure increased to 105 after a liter of normal saline.
Heart rate 65.
Blood pressure 104/45.
Respiratory rate 18.
Oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
He has 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and there is no peripheral edema.
He has normal finger nose finger testing, sensation to light touch is intact and he has 5 out of 5 muscular strength in all extremities diffusely.
Rectal examination demonstrates guaiac positive, black tarry stool.
INITIAL LABORATORY EVALUATION:  White blood cell count of 7.7, hematocrit 27.3, platelet count 158,000.
PT 13.5, PTT 26.9, INR 1.2.
Serum chemistries demonstrate sodium 137, potassium 5.2, chloride 106, bicarbonate 26, BUN 71, creatinine 1.6, glucose 107.
His CK is 77 and his troponin is less then 0.01.
Initial chest radiograph demonstrated no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
Initial electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per minute, normal axis, increased PR interval consistent with first degree AV block, inferior Q waves, lateral Q waves and inferolateral T wave inversions.
Because the patient's hematocrit continued to drop following these procedures, during his third esophagogastroduodenoscopy the anastomotic site was treated with Argon plasma coagulation.
By the time of discharge his hematocrit was stable at 36 for approximately 24 hours.
The patient was therefore deemed medically stable for discharge to home with plans for a repeat hematocrit check on [**2157-2-7**].
Of note, because the patient's bleeding source was believed to be his prior anastomotic site, surgical consultation was obtained on the day prior to discharge for evaluation of any possible surgical options that may resolve the patient's bleeding.
In addition, the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes on multiple occasions.
Although his Propanolol was initially held around the time of his acute gastrointestinal bleeding on admission this medication was subsequently restarted and titrated to both heart rate and blood pressure.
Hypertension:  As noted above, the patient's Propanolol was titrated to blood pressure throughout the hospitalization.
Lorazepam 2 to 4 mg po q.h.s.
Nitropaste [**4-13**] of an inch transdermally b.i.d.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2-7**] to have a hematocrit checked.
Further consideration or adjustment of the patient's medication regimen should be made at that time.
