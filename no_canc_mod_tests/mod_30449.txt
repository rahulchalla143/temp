At that time, on initial examination at she had left hemiparesis.She was also taking aspirin at the time.
Electroencephalogram was obtained, which frontal bilateral parietal and bilateral cerebellar strokes and question positive diffusion study in the right posterior limb and the internal capsule and right anteromedial temporal lobe.
A repeat MRI and MRA showed subarachnoid and intra parenchymal blood with supraclinoid ICA stenosis, question vasospasm.
She was admitted to the Neurosurgery Service, had an angiogram at that point, which was negative for aneurysm, and confirmed the ICA stenosis.
Her admission vital signs at that time were a temperature of 97.1, heart rate of 78, blood pressure 122/60, respiratory rate 15, O2 sat 96%.
Funduscopic examination was normal.
Her strength examination she did have a left pronator drift, 4 out of 5 left triceps weakness as well as a 4- weakness of her extensors and of her wrists and fingers on the left.
Coordination showed some ataxia and finger nose finger on the left upper extremity.
Rapid alternating movements were also somewhat slow on the left.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 7.2, hematocrit 27.9, platelets 252, sodium 141, potassium 3.3, chloride 101, CO2 23, BUN 9, creatinine .7, glucose 74.
MRI and MRA [**1-1**] showed subarachnoid blood extending from the right ICA to the intra parenchymal region, small amount of blood seen in both lateral ventricles, small intra peranchymal component involving the medial anterior temporal lobe.
MRA showed a supraclinoid stenosis showing narrowing of right side.
TCDs were done on [**1-3**] showed increase velocity of the right MCA, siphon and ACA.
Angiogram done on [**1-3**] and subsequently repeated on [**1-9**] did not show an aneurysm or AVM.
Her second angiogram on [**1-9**] showed improved vasospasm of the ICA in the vicinity of the hemorrhage.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the Neurology Service we had her on heparin for a goal PTT of 40 to 50.
While her INR was coming into acceptable range we decided that with the complex nature of her history that we would watch her extremely closely in regard to her anticoagulation status.
It was agreed that we would initially keep her INR from 1.5 to 2 and monitor her neurological examination closely and see how she tolerated this in the coming weeks after discharge.
It was agreed that we may be able to let her INR come up somewhat more toward cardiology INR goal of 2.5-3.5.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] blood pressure has always been systolic of 102 to 120 and this has at times limited us from using antihypertensives and rate control agents such as beta blockers for her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
We decided to mange her BP and HR with Coreg 6.25 mg b.i.d.
She will require frequent INR checks likely q day until the Digoxin load and Coumadin level have both reached a steady state.
She will be discharged to rehab today to [**Hospital1 **] on telemetry monitoring and for physical therapy, occupational and speech therapy.
(this may need to be adjusted per cardiology as her rate/blood pressure will tolerate it).
Her INR should be checked q day until a steady state is reached between her Coumadin and her Digoxin.
She should also have a Depakote level checked in the coming weeks.
FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient needs q day INR checks with a goal INR for now of 1.5 to 2 over the next few weeks.
Her blood pressure and pulse should be monitored closely and she should be on telemetry both on transfer as well as at [**Hospital1 **].
