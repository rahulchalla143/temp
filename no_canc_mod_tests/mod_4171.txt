Initial head CT was normal and LP was performed which showed elevated protein of >200 he was then admitted to the floor.
He had MRI which was reportedly negative for stroke and his R sided weakness appeared to have resolved.
Repeat head CT showed dense R MCA infarfct with subsequent MRI showing acute infarct of R MCA territory.
Pseudoseizures 4.
Abd: Soft, NT, BS+ and no abdominal bruit noted.
He spontaneous and puposively moves the right, which is antigravity and likely full strength (poor effort on strength exam and not always following commands).
Pertinent Results: [**3-20**] Brain perfusion - 1.
[**3-20**] CT head/neck - 1.
[**3-21**] Ct head - 1.
[**3-21**] Brain MRI - Continued maturation of large right MCA territory infarction with hemorrhagic transformation within the right putamen.
While this examination did not include an MR angiogram, there is suggestion of interval recanalization of the right M1 segment which has a probable flow void.
[**3-21**] CT Head - Interval increase in the hemorrhage within the known large right MCA territory infarct, with increased mass effect and leftward shift of midline structures and mild uncal henriation.
[**3-21**] CXR - Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
[**3-22**] Ct head - 1.
Left perihilar and left lower lobe atelectases are increasing  CT Head [**2108-3-24**] FINDINGS: Overall, there is no significant interval change.
CXR [**2108-3-27**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
Brief Hospital Course: Stroke [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 22159**] was admitted as a OSH transfer after an MRI demonstrated an acute Right MCA infarct.
Craniectomy On [**3-21**] Patient developed increasing lethargy and a head Ct obtained demonstrated interval increase of rigth cerebral edema with midline shift and right uncas was trending downwards.
His chest x-ray reveals questionable infiltrate without frank pneumonia.

Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**] Date/Time:[**2108-6-5**] 2:30 This will be at [**Hospital1 18**], [**Location (un) 86**], [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building, Level 8.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
