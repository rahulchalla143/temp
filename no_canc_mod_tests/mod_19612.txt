At that point, his BPs dropped to 60/40 and he was placed on dopamine with recovery of pressures in to the 90s systolic.
Labs at OSH revealed K 4.1, creatinine 0.9, WBC 11.5, Hct 48, Plt 226.
ABG showed 7.32, pCO2 30, pO2 307, FiO2 100%, He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **]; en route, dopamine was turned off and patient was switched to levophed on arrival here.

EKG here: atrial fibrillation at rate of 80. normal axis.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: atrial fibrillation 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2196-11-29**] demonstrated: dilated LV (66 mm ed and 57 mm es), EF 25%, mild MR, dilated LA, LV systolic function severely impaired with diffuse LV hypokinesis and symmetric LVH, mild TR, RV systolic pressure 41 * Previous echo ([**12/2196**]) with EF 52%  TTE [**2197-5-27**]:  LV cavity severely dilated with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CXR [**5-26**]: profound cardiomegaly, likely fluid overload CXR [**6-2**]: Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
EEG [**5-28**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the frequent left more than right frontal spike or sharp and slow wave discharges as well as the slow and disorganized background rhythm.
The slow and disorganized background rhythm is suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy which may be seen with medication effect, toxic metabolic abnormalities, infections, or global ischemic injury.

Patient presented with evidence of CHF and fluid overload on exam - rales on PE and pulmonary edema on CXR.
A subsequent TTE showed an EF 20-25%.
The neurology service was consulted and a CT head/c spine was done to rule out intracranial or cervical injury.
#) Fever/ leukocytosis: The patient presented with low grade fever (100.0) and leukocytosis (11.5) which progressed throughout hospital stay to tmax of 102.4 on [**5-29**].
clinical suspicion was for sinusitis versus PNA ([**5-27**] sputum sample positive for 4+GPR, 2+GPC; ?LLL opacity on CXR) versus line infection (swan tip culture negative to date).
Blood cultures and urine cultures returned negative to date.
#) Respiratory status: The patient was intubated by EMS and was maintained on ventilation with assist control with Tv 600, RR 14, weaning FiO2 as tolerated.
