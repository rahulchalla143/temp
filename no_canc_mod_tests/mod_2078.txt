CT perfusion study indicates a very small acute infarction in the territory of the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery, in the right frontal lobe, with a small ischemic penumbra which is significantly larger than the area of infarction.
MRI head - There are three foci of acute infarction in the right cerebral hemisphere.
TTE - The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
TEE [**2176-12-6**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
MRI brain showed acute infarct in the right putamen and posterior limb of the internal capsule, another infarct in the right caudate and anterior limb of the internal capsule, and a right subcortical infarct.
An echo was obtained which was negative for source of clot.
He subsequently underwent a transesophageal echo to further evaluate which was negative for PFO, ASD, thrombus or complex aortic plaques (prelim read did show simple arch and descending aorta atheromas).
His Atenolol dose may be titrated up gradually for better blood pressure and heart rate control.
His HgbA1c was 5.6 and his lipid panel showed mildly elveated LDL, so he was started on Lipitor 20mg QD.
His exam on discharge was significant for LUE weakness in the 2-4/5 range and LLE weakness in the 3-4/5 range.
