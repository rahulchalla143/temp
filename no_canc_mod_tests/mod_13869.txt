Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2178-2-16**], severity of mitral regurgitation has probably worsened and right ventricle is now hypocontractile.
This study might be significantly UNDERestimating the severity of eccentric mitral regurgitation and if there is clinical concern for acute severe mitral regurgitation, a transesophageal study is recommended.
[**2183-7-19**] Chest CT 1.
[**2183-7-19**] cardiac cath FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Echo [**2183-7-31**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-7-19**], the mitral and aortic prostheses are new and are with normal gradients  Chest CT, abdomen, pelvis  [**2183-8-1**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Echo revealed severe MR and severe AS with a bicuspid aortic valve.
Cath did not reveal any significant coronary disease.
Target INR is 1.8-2.2 for postop Afib ( per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] due to chest hematoma).
Blood draws should be Mon-Wed-Fri ( next draw [**8-8**]) .
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: 1 mg today, then 0.5 mg Fri and Sat;then further daily dosing by provider; target INR 1.8-2.2 for postop A Fib .
Particle/Crystal PO BID (2 times a day): hold for K+ > 4.5  with IV lasix.
