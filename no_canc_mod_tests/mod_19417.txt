CXR [**2124-6-8**]: 1.
Comparison with prior studies (chest radiographs or CTs) is recommended and/or a baseline CT scan with IV contrast for further characterization.
Echo [**2124-6-9**]: Left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity enlargement and extensive regional and global biventricular systolic function c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
CT chest w/o contrast [**2124-6-9**]: 1.
However, short-term followup CT in [**3-24**] weeks may be helpful to ensure resolution and to exclude a neoplastic cause such as lymphoma or metastatic disease.
