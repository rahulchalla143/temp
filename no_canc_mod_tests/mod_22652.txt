He had presented the day prior to admission to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who in his workuop obtained blood cultures and an MRI enterography to assess for intestinal lymphangiectasia.
He had blood cultures drawn for a temperature of 101 in the office.
On the day of admission Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified that blood cultures grew GPCs and also his MR enterography showed thrombus in his proximal celiac artery, distal SMA, chronic or subacute infarct of left upper renal pole, small splenic infarct.
Rectal exam showed yellow, guaiac positive stools.
Lactate was 2.3. .
cardiac arrhythmia which he states he was told was insignificant  Social History: Notable for a former heavy smoker with 90 pack years, stopped approximately three years ago, distant alcohol intake and significant travel history.

As imaging was not targetted towards assessment of renal arterial vasculature, arterial clot is not definitely identified.
Splenic infarct.Given the multiple arterial thrombi/emboli, recommend echocardiogram to evaluate for potential cardiac valvular disease or right-to-left shunting.
Recommend evaluation with colonoscopy if not recently performed.
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2117-7-29**] at 11:30:24 AM      FINAL IMPRESSION: Large vegetation on the aortic valve.
CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2117-7-29**] 8:46 PM IMPRESSION: Scattered, patchy consolidations throughout the left lung consistent with possible septic emboli.
CT scan of the chest with IV contrast is recommended.
CTA CHEST/ABD/PELVIS W&W/O C & RECONS	Study Date of [**2117-7-30**] 3:28 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Filling defects in the proximal celiac artery and distal branch of the superior mesenteric artery compatible with thrombus/embolus, unchanged from the MR enterography of [**2117-7-27**].
Multiple areas of ground-glass opacification within the upper and lower lobes of lungs, corresponding to areas of opacification seen on the chest x-ray of [**2117-7-29**] are noted.
PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to [**8-18**], [**2117**].
The evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is difficult due to obscuration of the cardiac borders bilaterally by pleural effusion.
#Endocarditis: The patient presented to the [**Hospital **] clinic with a fever, at which blood cultures were drawn, and were shown to contain GPCs in clusters and pairs.
A TEE was performed which showed a large vegetation on the aortic valve with mild aortic regurgitation.
Blood cultures grew MSSA and the patient is on Nafcillin 2g q4h to complete a 6 week course; last day of antibiotics is [**2117-9-7**].
He has ID follow-up and will need weekly labs checked (CBC with diff, LFTs, BUN/Cr) and faxed to the [**Hospital **] clinic; follow-up appts are schedule with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6137**].
The patient should have a repeat Echo and blood cultures at the end of therapy to be certain he has cleared the infection.
Today, albumin is 2.1.
CXR showed bil.
He may need either up or down titration of this regimen depending on his diuresis.
On the day of discharge, the patient was still subtherapeutic on coumadin with an INR of 1.2.
He was recently started on a low-fat diet and a medium chain triglycerides, which are a large part of the Peptamen formulation, and found some improvement in his diarrhea, which was therefore thought to be evidence consistent with intestinal lymphangiectasia.
#Anemia: On admission, patient's HCT was 35.6.
His Hct stabilized during his hospitalization at 23-24.
The patient did not tolerate PO iron, however, and declined a blood transfusion though he would likely benefit from either of these strategies.
#Thrombocytopenia: On admission, the patient's plt count was 103.
[**Month/Year (2) **]:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* 3.

Outpatient Lab Work You will need weekly labs drawn including LFTs, Cr/BUN, and CBC with diff.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Home Solutions Infusion Therapy  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: - Chronic Diarrhea - Endocarditis - Mesenteric Arterial Thrombi - LUE DVT - Protein losing enteropathy .
You were admitted to the hospital after it was discovered on imaging of your abdomen that you had clots in the arteries that supply your intestinal tract; in addition, you had bacteria growing in your blood (known as MSSA).
These procedures showed that you have ulcers in your colon.
Biopsies showed esophagitis, ileitis, and focal inflammation in your colon - possibly as result of the blood clots or as a result of a chronic process that accounts for your ongoing protein-losing diarrhea.
Finally, your hospital course was complicated by a blood clot in your left arm that was associated with the PICC line (IV) that you had placed.
You will need weekly labs drawn including LFTs, Cr/BUN, and CBC with diff.
Finally, when you complete your antibiotic course, please have your doctor check a blood culture to make sure that you have been cleared of your infection.
You will also need a repeat Echocardiogram.
