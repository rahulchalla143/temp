[**2137-12-13**] Sputum Culture: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2137-12-13**]): >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2137-12-15**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**2137-12-12**] and [**2137-12-13**] Blood Cultures: Negative [**2137-12-16**] and [**2137-12-17**] C. Difficile Stool Culture: Negative .
[**2137-12-9**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Patient has had median sternotomy, transvenous right [**Month/Day/Year **] pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads follow their expected courses from the left axillary pacemaker.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded with certainty.
[**2137-12-12**] Cardiac Catheterization 1.
[**2137-12-12**] CXR: Since yesterday, ETT and nasogastric tube end in expected position.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-12-10**], the distal anterior function is improved and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are lower.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 82020**] was transferred to the CCU from an OSH for respiratory failure in the setting of coronary artery disease and an echo which showed a depressed EF of 10% and 3+ MR. .
His chest x-ray did not show significant congestion upon admission and there was no clear focal consolidation indicating pneumonia.
Sputum cultures were negative.
All blood and urine cultures were negative.
He had a sputum culture which showed 1+ gram negative rods on gram stain but no growth on culture.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2137-12-12**] which confirmed this.
He had an echo which showed an LV thrombus and was also in [**Known lastname **] fibrillation which were reasons for his anticoagulation.
When his INR was above 2.0, the heparin was stopped.
He was set up to have his labs drawn after discharge and faxed to his cardiologist in [**State 760**] who will further manage his anticoagulation.
ANEMIA Mr. [**Known lastname 82020**] was anemic with a hematocrit of 26.5 on admission.
Iron studies were checked and showed a low iron of 19 with a low TIBC and low transferritin but normal ferritin.
His B12 and folate levels were normal.
He received 2 units PRBCs during his stay and his HCT on discharge was 28.1. .
RENAL FAILURE Mr. [**Known lastname 82020**] had a creatinine of 2.3 on admission which rose as high as 2.5 on [**2137-12-16**] and was 2.1 on discharge.
He was set up with [**Hospital 3052**] with his cardiologist and was told to have his INR checked in 3 days.
