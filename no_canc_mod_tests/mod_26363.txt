Abdominal aortogram with right lower extremity run-off.
The pt denied any frank LOC, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, rigors, night sweats, weight loss, abdominal pain, n/v/d, LH, dizziness, urinary incontinence, bowel incontinence, or confusion.
The pt has an outpt appointment with her vascular surgeon for evaluation next Thurs.
In the ED, the pt was found to be initially hypothermic (T: 93) then febrile (T: 100.8), tachycardic (HR 106), hypotensive (BP: 84/49 -> 60/30) and Hypoxic (85% on 2L NC -> 97% 2L NC).
IVF (total 4L of NS) and pressors (DA then levophed, both off at time of transfer from ED) were given for hypotension and cultures were drawn.
CXR was read as infrahilar opacities concerning for infiltrates.
A head CT was neg for bleed, CTA was neg for PE and without frank consolidation, mild bibasilar atelectasis.
An Abdominal/Pelvic CT demonstrated wall thickening of transverse-sigmoid colon and scattered diverticuli.
The neurologic signs were thought to be due to hypotension from sepsis bringing out old neurologic findings.
Deferred [**Last Name (un) **] for outpt and follow serial hct and manage with supportive care.
Prior CVA s/p right CEA - treated at [**Hospital1 2025**], presented with right sided numbness, which is the only residual symptom 2.

Pertinent Results: STUDIES: CXR [**2173-3-28**]: infrahilar patchy opacities concerning for developing infiltrate vs. aspiration.
UA [**2173-3-28**]: Neg .
ECG [**2173-3-30**] Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-3-30**] the rhythm is now sinus rather than atrial fibrillation.
Head CT (non-contrast) [**2173-3-28**] IMPRESSION: No mass effect or hemorrhage.
If brain infarction is a concern then an MRI and MRA would be a more sensitive modality.

In addition, the CT scan demonstrated some diffuse wall thickening between the transverse colon and sigmoid colon.
Pulm source is also possible, however the CXR and CT are not convincing and may be better explained by aspiration post hypotension.
MRI/MRA of head was positive for a new lesion in L coronaradiata on [**2173-3-31**].
Pt was then worked up for TTE and TEE echo for assessment of clots as well as carotid U/S.
Although stool studies came back negative, pt initially presented w/?sepsis, bandemia and no other source found, will complete 7 day course.
Underwent Carotid U/S, TEE echo for further evaluation of source for embolic brain lesion.
