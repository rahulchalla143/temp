Abdominal CT showed striated nephrogram in right kidney that may have been pyelonephritis or an infarct.
An incision and drainage of all these areas was successfully performed [**5-19**] and the patient returned to the medicine floor on [**2192-5-21**].

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2192-5-25**] IMPRESSION: Mitral valve structure attatched to the base of the posterior mitral leaflet with mobile components and a partial flail segment.
Compared to the prior study from [**2192-5-18**] (tape reviewed), there is a newly identifed mass (mobile components) at the base of the posterior mitral valve leaflet with severe eccentric mitral regurgitaiton  ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in echotexture without evidence of focal hepatic masses.
Over the hospital course, she'd developed a new heart murmur with echocardiogram showing vegetations and severe mitral valve regurgitation.
Daily ECGs were performed to monitor cardiac function and she had negative cardiac enzymes [**2192-5-24**].
She likely has both systolic and diastolic dysfunction, requiring rate and blood pressure control.
She was given nebulizer therapy and oxygen supplementation to maintain oxygen saturation in the setting of COPD and CHF.
Urine output was closely monitored and the patient was given gently IVF per recommendations by the renal consult service.
She also had transaminitis likely secondary to bowel ischemia since RUQ ultrasound was negative for common bile duct dilatation.
On [**2192-5-28**], the patient was unresponsive and found to be breathless, pulseless, and without heart tones, blood pressure, and corneal reflexes.
