She was referred for right and left heart catheterization for further evaluation of her cardiomyopathy.
Cath did not show any obstructive coronary disease.
Right heart catheterization was notable for normal right and left sided filling pressures.

The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal left and right sided filling pressures.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
