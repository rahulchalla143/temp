ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver shows no focal or textural abnormality.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP and LVEDP of 34 mm Hg.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was severely elevated with PASP of 75 mm Hg.
Mean PCWP was elevated with mean 27 mm Hg.
Cardiac index was mildly depressed at 2.37 l/min/m2.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior (inferolateral) walls.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Interpretation assigned to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6506**] [**Name8 (MD) 6507**], MD, Interpreting physician   Brief Hospital Course: 52yo man w/ AIDS, hepatitis C, CAD s/p MI, bicuspid AV w/ severe AR & MR, w/ h/o CHF (EF unkown) who presents w/ escalating chest pain.
His pre-op evaluation entailed undergoing cardiac catheterization which demonstrated severe AS (area 0.6 cm2), wedge of 27 mm Hg, 3vd, distal LM 40-50% stenosis, LAD 70-80% stenosis, Lcx 60% stenosis and RCA diffuse disease to 80% stenosis.
# Hep C: The patient has never received therapy for his hepatitis C. Outside records of a liver biopsy in [**5-30**] demonstrated steatosis, lymphocytic infiltration of portal triads with piecemeal necrosis and lobular inflammation.
trichrome stain with expansion of portal triads with portal-to-portal and portal-to-central vein bridging and fibrosis surrounding single cells.
Abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly a liver with normal contours.
This was successful in maintaining oxygen saturations and he was transferred to the cardiac surgery unit on ECMO and multiple pressors with an open chest.
He had a few chest wash outs during this time to clear fluid accumulation in the chest.
