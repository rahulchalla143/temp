He stopped taking his aspirin on 4 days prior to admission ([**2157-4-10**]) as he was advised to do so in order to go for a scheduled CT myelogram.
In [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], his VS were 97.3, P 49, BP 98/65, R 18, and O2 97% on 4L.
EKG showed STEs in II, III, AVF, V3-V6, ST depressions in I, AVL, and TWIs in V1,V2.
He was also given 500 cc NS and his BP incrased to 108.
He then had a right heart catheterization, which showed elevated RA pressures (18) and mildly elevated left-sided pressures.
He was then admitted to the CCU for further evaluation given the liklihood of RV infarct.

Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated one vessel disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 20 mmHg.
The systemic arterial pressure was normal with a central aortic pressure of 122/73 mmHg.
ECHO ([**2157-4-13**] 3:54:12 PM): - Mild symmetric LVH.
EF 30-35%.
Compared to the previous tracing ST segment elevation in the inferior leads is reduced.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 40860**] is a 64 yo man with h/o hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain and was found to have an inferolateral STEMI who subsequently underwent PCI with BMS X 2 insertion to RCA with uncomplicated post-cath course.
R/I for large STEMI with peak CK 6944 and trop 13.44.
His cardiac catheterization demonstrated two occlusions of the RCA, for which he had two BMS placed, and his hemodynamics were concerning for a RV infarct.
Follow-up TTE demonstrated mild symmetric LVH with regional LV systolic dysfunction, RV dysfunction consistent with RCA ischemia/infarction and no significant valvular abnormality.
Hyperlipidemia: Atorvastatin increased from 20mg daily to 80mg daily.
Lipid profiling done showed LDL at goal, HDL 35. .
OUTPATIENT ISSUES -- Follow-up blood pressure as outpatient; if stable and patient without symptoms of orthostasis can be restarted or may consider alternative BPH medication without side effect profile of hypotensive.
You had a heart attack and required emergency cardiac catheterization and 2 bare metal stents were placed in your right coronary artery.
Start taking Metoprolol to slow your heart rate and help your heart beat effectively 3.
Start lisinopril to lower your blood pressure and help your heart beat more effectively 4.
Stop taking Alfuzosin until seen in follow-up and your blood pressure is stable.
