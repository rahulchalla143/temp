The patient saw his primary care physician who referred the patient for exercise treadmill test which was done on [**2159-2-28**], and showed ejection fraction of 47%, minimal left ventricular reversible dilatation and moderately severe inferolateral reversible defect and inferolateral hypokinesis.
The patient was then referred for cardiac catheterization.
His catheterization was done on [**2159-3-16**], and showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50%, left internal mammary artery of approximately 50% distal and left anterior descending of approximately 80% distal stenosis and 80% stenosis at D1, 50% at mid diagonal, left circumflex total occlusion, 60% before left posterior descending artery and right coronary artery 70% ostial and total occlusion of mid.
Heart rate is 66, blood pressure 134/90, respiratory rate 19, oxygen saturation 95% in room air.
Examination of the neck revealed supple neck, no jugular venous distention, no bruits, and carotid pulses 1+ bilaterally.
Examination of the lungs revealed lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Examination of the heart revealed regular rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Examination of the abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, well healed midline supraumbilical incision.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Radial artery pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Sensory and motor examinations were grossly intact.
The patient's mean arterial pressure on transfer to the recovery room was 70, central venous pressure was 12.
Arterial blood gas was 7.41, 37, 88, 24 and 0, oxygen saturation 94% in room air.
White blood cell count was 14.6 and hematocrit was 23.9.
Pulse was at 104, good pressure, saturating well.
White blood cell count was down to 9.1 and hematocrit was 24.2.
Pulse was 91, and blood pressure was 116/59.
On postoperative day number six, the patient was doing well, remained afebrile with stable vital signs and the white blood cell count was 7.6, hematocrit 26.6, platelet count 261,000 and creatinine 1.2.
