Her troponin was elevated in 0.4 range and in the days to follow, it rose as high as 1.2.
Recommendation was to stop lisinopril as patient was in worsening renal failure, beta blocker was recommended, but currently held, as patient blood pressure has been quite low.
Patient was cleared for the angiogram by cardiology.
Patient had an echocardiogram which showed right ventricular strain.
Patient had an angiogram done which showed stenosis in the left femoral to popliteal bypass graft, which was angioplastied.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Patient has blood cultures pending.
The culture grew beta streptococcus.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
However, she developed a supraventricular arrhythma with HR 130-140, similar to episodes of junctional tachycardia documented during prior admissions.
EKG while tachycardic also demonstrated ischemic ST elevations in the inferior leads with reciprocal depressions in the precordium.
Shortly thereafter, the patient's blood pressure became unstable, requiring >8L of fluid as well as neosynephrine.
She then spontaneously converted to NSR and her BP stabilized, although pressors continued to be required.
