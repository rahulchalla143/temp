In ED, she was hypotensive to SBP 80s.
CXR w/ no infiltrate.
EKG without ST-T segment changes.
In the MICU, she was treated with vancomycin, ampillicin-sulbactam, and [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim showed a basal level > 20 but a small increase.
Pulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
- CT TORSO [**11-30**]: 1.
- ECHO [**12-1**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Based on [**2195**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is asymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**12-28**] years.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2194-7-16**], the aortic stenosis has progressed.
- CXR [**12-2**]: Increasing bibasilar opacities and left lower lobe atelectasis.
- CXR [**12-6**]: Bilateral patchy infiltrates in the posterior bases indicative of bronchopneumonic infiltrates.
- CXR [**12-9**]: Recurrence of bibasilar opacification right greater than left.
- ECG [**12-9**]: Regular rhythm - may be sinus tachycardia with first degree A-V delay but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.

Within 24 hours, her blood pressure had sufficiently stabilized for her to be transferred to the floor.
On the floor, her course was generally characterized by stable blood pressures but mild tachypnea, with respiratory rates generally between 22 and 26 per minute.
Notably, she was transferred back to the MICU roughly halfway through her hospitalization for further monitoring when she became increasingly tachypneic.
She had two blood culture bottles drawn during her initial visit to the ED that subsequently grew coagulase-negative staph.
This was considered to be a contaminant by the Infectious Diseases consultants as multiple subsequent blood cultures showed no growth.
She was consequently treated with Vancomycin for several days (roughly six), until after more blood cultures had returned negative.
One urine culture (of six) was also positive for bacterial growth, producing enterobacter and morganella.
This, too, was not believed to be the source of her fevers as she had no symptoms of a UTI and her urinalysis from that day was clean, having no WBC or bacteria.
A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no evidence of endocarditis.
Given the relatively low sensitivity of this test for endocarditis, a transesophageal echo was suggested, but the patient was highly resistant to this, even after the bariatric surgeon who was consulted assured her that this would not be contraindicated in a patient with her previous surgeries.
A CT angiogram to look for PE was also considered.
Indeed, she continued to have O2 saturations of 98% to 100% on room air even through her final hospital day.
Finally, a CT of the torso was performed that showed no significant intra-abdominal pathology but did reveal bilateral basilar infiltrates suggestive of an aspiration pneumonia.
Vancomycin was discontinued after roughly six days (two days after the ID consultants recommended stopping it), when enough blood cultures had been negative to convince us that the initial coag-negative staph was a contaminant.
Zosyn was stopped after nine days, when she had shown clinical improvement (afebrile for 72 hours, WBC count falling from peak of 36 to 26, respiratory rate decreased from 26 to 22) and when the Hematology consultants suggested that it may be responsible for her worsening thrombocytopenia (see below).
Heparin-dependent antibodies, 95% sensitive for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT), were negative.
Her chest x-rays had suggested pulmonary edema, and she had increasing pedal edema.
Her creatinine rose to a peak of 1.5 after receiving IV CT contrast.
Her abdominal exam was followed and her nutrition was supplemented with the recommendations of a nutritionist.
Her hematocrit was stable, slightly below her baseline.
Her iron studies suggested anemia of chronic disease.
Before further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions could be enacted, she became markedly tachypneic, and "triggered" for a respiratory rate of 36.
At this time, she also had an axillary temperature of 99.8 but notably was satting 98% on room air.
At that point, we had only a venous blood gas that suggested an alkalosis.
She had then become increasingly tachypneic (with a respiratory rate over 40), diaphoretic, and delirious.
An autopsy was performed at the family's request.
