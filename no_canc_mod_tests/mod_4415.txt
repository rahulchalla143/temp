On that admission, EKG showed right heart strain and possible lateral ischemic changes.
Pulmonary embolism was considered; V/Q scan was read as low probability.
He was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and a PNA and then sent to the floor, finished course Oxacillin for bacteremia while in house.
Other issues during that hospitalization included: -CTA [**1-16**] showed an enlarged left-sided pleural effusion (fluid density) and a R-sided pleural effusion that was determined to be solid on thorocentesis (Path result is pending) -HIV, [**Doctor First Name **] and RF were sent and found to be negative; scleroderma ab neg -[**1-8**] TTE was obtained and showed a dilated RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal movement; moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension consistent with a primary pulmonary process.
LVEF was >55%.
-Seen on CTA [**2143-1-16**]: 1.
Recommend follow-up CT in 1 year.
Thoracentesis on [**2-7**] removed ~800 cc serosanguinous fluid which was negative for malignant cells.
His O2 Sats were stable on 5LNC.
On [**2-12**] pt's sats stable while working with physical therapy.
His CRI was followed closely and Cr stable at 1.9 in setting of aggressive diuresis.

The RA pressure was slightly elevated at mean of 14mmHG with a relatively normal left sided filling pressure with PCWP of 11mmHG.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.2.
With oxygen PA was measured at 83/38 mean 57 and PCWP of 13mmHG.
With nitric oxygen pressure was 91/39 wit mean of 60.
The cardiac index did improve on oxygen to 2.7 and on nitric oxide to 3.2 FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
[**2143-2-4**] ECHO Bubble Study: Conclusions: No definite right-to-left passage of microbubbles identified at rest or with  maneuvers (cough, post-Valsalva).
An area of increased opacity is noted within the left retrocardiac region, with interval improvement since the recent study.
Bibasilar consolidation is more pronounced in comparison to the previous studies and may represent pneumonia or secondary atelectasis.
The spleen, adrenals, kidneys and pancreas are unremarkable except for left renal cortical atrophy.
IMPRESSION: 1) Increased, moderate left pleural effusion.
[**2143-2-8**] ECHO TTE: Conclusions: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
If clinically indicated, CT scan may be useful to further characterize this finding.
Limited examination secondary to cirrhotic heterogeneously echogenic liver.
Although no focal liver lesions are identified, given the technical difficulties of this ultrasound surveillance, CT or MRI surveillance for lesions could be performed for future examinations.
