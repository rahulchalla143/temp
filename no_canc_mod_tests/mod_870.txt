She also reports pleuritic chest pain, decreased oral intake, and left-sided abdominal pain.
On the floor, when she was admitted to the [**Doctor Last Name **] team, she was found to have a potassium of 7 and a bicarbonate of 10.
Digoxin level was 4.8.
She was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/40 and was 97% on room air.
Found to have an INR of approximately 8 possible secondary to the medications that she had been taking; however, the patient was unclear what medicine she had been taking.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination on transfer to the [**Hospital1 139**] team, her blood pressure was 84 to 91/30 to 50.
Her heart rate was 90 to 100, a regular rate and rhythm.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  On [**3-10**], she had a white blood cell count of 9.8, hematocrit was 29.4, and platelets were 264.
INR was 7.9.
Sodium was 134, potassium was 7, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 10, blood urea nitrogen was 163, creatinine was 10.8, and blood glucose was 120.
Calcium was 8.9, phosphorous was 11.5, and magnesium was 2.6.
Her laboratories on [**5-11**] revealed white blood cell count was 6, hemoglobin was 8.5, hematocrit was 24.4, and platelets were 167.
INR was 2.4.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone was 0.92.
Sodium was 137, potassium was 4, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen was 93, and creatinine was 6.5 (this was after dialysis).
Creatinine kinases were 47, 30, and 28.
Calcium was 8.6, phosphorous was 7.9, and magnesium was 1.9.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  She had a KUB on [**2163-3-10**] which showed a small-bowel resection in the pelvis.
She had a renal ultrasound on [**3-10**] as well.
An abdominal ultrasound on [**3-16**]; probable simple left cyst.
The kidney was 10.6 with a 2.6 cm cyst which is probably simple.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a 77-year-old woman with severe valvular disease, chest pain/pressure, dyspnea on exertion and at rest, fatigue, and found to be in acute renal failure, hypotensive, status post dialysis, with a persistent low blood pressure.
Hematocrit was 24.4 of unclear etiology.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  Hematocrit was down to 24.4 in the context of an elevated INR.
Her hematocrit jumped to 32.9.
Gastroenterology was consulted who recommended an outpatient colonoscopy as there were no signs of brisk bleed, and the patient's hematocrit was stable for greater than 48 hours status post the initial transfusion.
Liver function tests were within normal limits.
Her INR was 1.7 on the day of discharge.
She was started back on her Coumadin at 2.5 mg when her INR was 1.7.
The patient was to have an outpatient colonoscopy to follow up on the guaiac-positive stools in the context of a very supratherapeutic INR.
Iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency anemia.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Congestive heart failure: Initially the patient had hypotesion and was not given any treatment for her congestive heart failure after the blood transfusion and improvement of the patient's blood pressure to 120 to 145/50 to 60.
The goal will be to start an ACE inhibitor and place on hydralazine and nitrates when the patient's creatinine is less than 1.5.
An echocardiogram on [**2163-3-11**] showed an ejection fraction of 65% and P-R gradient of approximately 32 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal, greater than 55%.
Beta blocker was titrated up as the patient was diuresed, and on the day of discharge her heart rate was in the low 90s, and her blood pressure was 112/70.
On the day of discharge, her creatinine was 1.4 and her blood urea nitrogen was 35.
Anemia with guaiac-positive stools with an INR of 8.
She did have the echocardiogram (as stated earlier), and she was on dialysis (as stated earlier).
