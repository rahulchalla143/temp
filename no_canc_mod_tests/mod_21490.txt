The patient was woken up from sleep early the morning of admission by [**9-19**] sharp, substernal bilateral chest pain, which was associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, and possible palpitations.
The chest pain was nonpleuritic and aside from mild right forearm tingling, did not radiate.
At the outside hospital, the EKG showed ST elevations greater than 3 mm at I, aVL, V1 through V5, peaked T's anteriorly, ST depressions inferiorly, poor R-wave progression.
This first set of CK and troponin-I were normal.
Patient was treated with Heparin, nitroglycerin, aspirin, Lopressor and was transferred here for emergent cardiac catheterization, which revealed an 80 percent stenosis of the mid RCA, 100 percent proximal LAD stenosis, 80 percent proximal left circumflex, and 99 percent stenosis of the OM-1.
The left ventricular end diastolic pressure was 31 mm Hg.
The LAD was stented and intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, and the patient was enrolled in the Coil MI2 clinical trial.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  His temperature was 36.5 C, heart rate 60-84, blood pressure 110-122/90-98, respiratory rate 10-12, and oxygen saturation 100 percent on room air.
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, sclerae are anicteric, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
His jugular venous pressure was approximately 7 cm up 45 degrees.
Cardiovascular exam was regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with good aeration.
He had 2 plus pedal pulses bilaterally.
His EKG on [**2147-6-26**] at 11:02 a.m. showed sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute, poor baseline artifact, anterior ST elevations less pronounced, approximately 1.5 to 2 mm.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed a normal left main coronary artery, proximally occluded LAD, a proximal 80 percent tubular lesion on the left circumflex.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CK of 5109 with a CK MB of 490.
In addition, the patient had a normal Chem-7 with a creatinine of 1.0 at the outside hospital with an initial CPK of 116 and MB 1.0, troponin-I of less than 0.05 at [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital.
He had a normal hematocrit and platelet count prior to catheterization.
There was discussion regarding whether the most appropriate course of care would be to perform a CABG or to repeat catheterization with stenting of the other lesions in the RCA and the left circumflex.
Given that these lesions appeared to be discrete rather than long tubular lesions, a decision was made that repeat catheterization would be a favorable choice in this patient.
The patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization on [**2147-6-29**] with a stent to the RCA and the circumflex.
He did not develop any significant hematomas or bleeding from his catheterization site.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] recommended that the patient have an echocardiogram as well as a Holter monitor prior to following up with her [**8-10**] at 12:30 p.m. to help discuss possible electrophysiology study and possible ICD placement if needed.
In addition, the patient was started on Coumadin given that his post-ST elevation MI echocardiogram demonstrated the patient had a depressed ejection fraction of 25 percent with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and akinesis of the distal [**3-14**] of the heart with evidence of mild aneurysm of the apex.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his primary care physician to check his INR and for Coumadin adjustment.
He also has a follow-up appointment on [**8-21**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] at 12:30.
until INR is therapeutic.
