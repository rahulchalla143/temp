EKG [**10-23**] Baseline artifact at the end of the tracing.
CATH [**10-23**] COMMENTS: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial normotension with a central aortic pressure of 128/68, mean 94 mmHg.
EKG [**10-24**] Baseline artifact.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-10-23**] the diffuse T wave inversions are new, as are the inferior Q waves, consistent with evolution of the previously seen inferior myocardial infarction pattern.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior, posterior, and lateral hypokinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CXR [**10-24**] FINDINGS: Evaluation is slightly limited due to severe levoscoliosis of the thoracic spine.
Post catheterization EKG demonstrated resolution of the STE but new Q waves in II and AVF.
Echo the following day demonstrated LVEF 35% and depressed RV function.
Blood pressure was well controlled at discharge.
Her LVEF is 35% on recent echo thought to be depressed from baseline.
This was changed to atorvastatin 80mg after her MI .
U/A positive, started on ceftriaxone empirically and culture grew klebsiella in urine, sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
BP and HR monitoring on new medicines 5.
Repeat ECHO in 6 weeks to assess EF.
Calcium 600 + D(3) 600 mg(1,500mg) -400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hopital on [**2121-10-23**] with a heart attack.
You had a heart catheterization the same day and 2 bare metal stents placed in your right coronary artery.
You will need labs repeated in 3 days.
