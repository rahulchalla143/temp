Upon evaluation for the current admission, the patient's daughter stated that since her discharge, the patient's mental status has been at baseline until the day prior to admission when she became slightly more depressed.
At the nursing home, her temperature was 101.1 F.; heart rate was 106 and respiratory rate was 14.
Coronary artery disease with a history of anterior myocardial infarction and an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On evaluation in the Emergency Room, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 101.8 F.; blood pressure 145/66; heart rate 110; respiratory rate 22; 99% on a non-rebreather, 93% on room air at rest.
She had fine crackles half way up bilaterally on her lung examination and had occasional expiratory wheezes.
Her PEG site was clean, dry and intact without erythema or drainage.
On neurologic examination, she responded to commands by opening her eyes, but appeared sedated.
LABORATORY:   Her labs were as follows on admission, white blood cell count 19.8, hematocrit 29.7, platelets 671.
She had 70% neutrophils and 7% bands.
Her electrolytes were as follows:  Sodium 139, potassium 3.8, chloride 99, bicarbonate 29, BUN 18, creatinine 0.5, glucose 143.
Her first set of cardiac enzymes revealed the following:  A CK of 30, MB of 3, troponin of 0.13.
Her second troponin was 0.15.
Her INR was 1.2.
Two sets of blood cultures and a urine culture were drawn.
Her ALT was 25, alkaline phosphatase 82, total bilirubin 0.2, lipase 78, amylase 83.
On urinalysis she had moderate leukocytes and moderate blood.
She had a white blood cell count of greater than 50 in her urine and many bacteria.
Chest x-ray showed increasing rounded but ill defined opacity in the left upper lobe, same as in [**2146-2-17**].
An EKG was done which showed sinus tachycardia at 108 with normal intervals and left axis deviation.
She had been placed on Levaquin to treat for the urinary tract infection, however, when the cultures came back showing methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, the patient was switched to Vancomycin.
Also, blood cultures had been drawn upon admission.
The first set of blood cultures ended up growth enterococcus which was resistant to Vancomycin; thus, the patient's Vancomycin was discontinued and the Levaquin was discontinued as well.
Surveillance blood cultures were drawn daily.
PULMONARY NODULE:  Given the presence of this pulmonary nodule on chest x-ray upon admission, a CT scan was recommended by a pulmonary consultation that had been obtained in the early part of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course.
CT scan showed that the nodule had been present on a prior CT scan but had slightly grown in size.
The first two sets of sputum cultures had no acid fast bacilli on smear.
Cultures were pending.
ELEVATED TROPONIN:  Given that the patient's CK and MBs were within normal limits, it was thought that the patient's slightly elevated troponins were likely from demand ischemia.
Her hematocrit remained stable throughout the remainder of her hospital course.
A swallow consultation was obtained to see if the patient was at high risk for aspiration.
Her blood sugars remained well controlled during her hospital stay.
