Serologies were sent for Lyme and Babesiosis, which were both negative.
In the ED, the patient's VS were T 99.8, P 107, BP 137/78, O2 100% on RA.
The patient had a CXR performed, which showed a markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
An ECHO was then performed, which showed a large pericardial effusion and sustained right atrial collapse.
Patient's pericardial pressure was found to be 14.
Patient was then admitted to the CCU for further workup and evaluation.
Physical Exam: VS: T 101.8, BP 112/56 , HR 102, RR 29, O2 94% on RA Gen: Young man, pleasant, well-nourished, in NAD.
Breath sounds not well appreciated secondary to pain with inspiration.

Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 17 mm Hg and PCWP mean of 15 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.4 l/min/m2.
The pericardial pressure decreased to 5 mm Hg.
Echo ([**2179-9-30**]):  The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Echo ([**2179-10-1**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echo ([**2179-10-2**]):  Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

CXR demonstrated enlarged cardiac silhouette, and subsequent TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse.
Gm stain and cultures were all negative.
Labs were sent for TB, [**Doctor First Name **], ds-DNA, Lyme, and Babesiosis, which were all negative.
The patient had two repeat ECHOs during this hospitalization, which both showed resolution of the tamponade physiology.
Medications on Admission: Tylenol prn Oxycodone 10 mg prn for pain in neck and chest   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Cardiac tamponade Pericardial effusion Bilateral pleural effusions Lung granuloma   Discharge Condition: ambulatory, SpO2 100% on RA   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you had signs of cardiac tamponade, which means that fluid was building up in the sac around your heart causing compromise of your heart's ability to pump.
You received serial echocardiograms which demonstrated that a small amount of fluid was still in your heart.
In addition, you had a CT scan which showed that some fluid had developed below your lungs, called a pleural effusion.
You should undergo a Echocardiogram this week to assess for reaccumulation of the fluid around your heart.
