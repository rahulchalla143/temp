Admission Date:  [**2133-6-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-7-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-4-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization w/ [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] X1   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 41 yo man with h/o GERD and 3-week history of stable angina who presented s/p cardiac catheterization with possible RV perforation.
The chest pain was a pressure, [**4-3**], exacerbated with exertion, which radiated to his left shoulder.
During the cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was found to have a 99% stenosis in the LAD and an apical occlusion.
The patient had a TTE at this time which did not show any evidence of effusion.
Physical Exam: VS: T 98.2, BP 132/74, R 16, P 88, O2 99% RA GENERAL: Middle aged man, pleasant, in NAD.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 8 cm.
PULSES: Right: DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: ETT: [**2133-6-29**] at [**Hospital3 **]: Reproduced chest pressure after 4-5 minutes into the test and remained 4 minutes into recovery.
CARDIAC CATH: [**2133-6-29**] (at [**Hospital1 18**]):  LAD with 99% mid stenosis with ?
thrombus, muscle bridge distal (50% stenosis) and apical occlusion (wrap around LAD) -> PTCA -> stenting -> slow flow suggesting acute worsening of stenosis, active plaque -> 0% residual in mid vessel -> advanced wire through the apical occlusion to restore some flow -> slight contrast stain worrisome for microperforation -> echo showed no effusion -> slow flow restored across the apical LAD.
CXR ([**6-29**]): PA and lateral views of the chest reveal clear lungs with normal cardiac and mediastinal outlines and pulmonary vascular distribution.

Pulsus checked overnight after cardiac cath, negative throughout.
The patient had serial TTE echocardiograms to assess for pericardial effusion.
# CAD:  The patient has a three week history of stable angina, for which he underwent cardiac catheterization today.
Cardiac enzymes peaked on [**2133-6-30**] at 10am (CK306 MB23 MBI7.5    Trop0.37) but trended down ([**2133-7-1**] AM CK188 MB12 I6.4 Trop0.36).
Disp:*30 * Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Stable chest pain (angina) s/p elective cardiac catheterization w/ drug-eluting stent placement X1   Discharge Condition: Improved.
A blockage was found in one of your heart vessels and a stent placed to open up the vessel and maintain blood flow.
