Concurrent with this the patient was noted to have a drop in her hematocrit from a baseline of around 30 to 25.5 on [**3-14**] and by the following day her oxygen saturation continued to drop requiring increasing amounts of oxygen.
Chest x-ray was concerning for interstitial edema consistent with congestive heart failure and the patient was diuresed with intravenous Lasix and was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells as her hematocrit had dropped to 25.
By the next day her oxygen saturations continued to drop despite diuresis and a pulmonary consult was obtained.
Recommendation was made to obtain a CT of the chest with intravenous contrast, which was revealing for diffuse interstitial edema including the alveoli and recommendation was made to proceed with bronchoscopy.
Bronchoscopy was postponed as the patient developed a bradyarrhythmia with frequent pauses as well as rates in the 30s and 40s.
By [**3-19**] oxygen requirement had increased to 100% FIO2 on a nonrebreather with sats being maintained in the mid 90% range.
An induced sputum was sent by respiratory therapy for a PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2347**], later that day the patient's oxygenation continued to worsen, began to develop mental status changes.
An arterial blood gas was sent, which showed a PAO2 of 35 and the patient was emergently intubated with initially difficult oxygenation either with 100% FIO2 and PEEP was gradually increased to about 15 bringing the PAO2 to above 70.
Appearance on chest x-ray appeared to be that of a resolving diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Data did support the use of plasmaphoresis in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to scleroderma is unfortunately scant, however, given the patient's critical illness it was felt that a trial of plasmaphoresis would be worthwhile.
Over the course of the next five days the patient's oxygenation significantly improved with stabilization of the hematocrit and FIO2 weaned down to .45 as well as a decrease of the PEEP down to 5.
Bronchoscopy was performed once again, which showed evidence of ongoing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
No clear evidence of an infectious process as contributing to this current worsening as gram stain as well as cultures were negative for any growth of organisms.
It was felt that it was likely due to the aggresive diuresis and reducing volume overload that was evident on chest x-ray.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 2348**] the patient was discontinued from the Bactrim she a Swan-Ganz catheterization was performed in order to ascertain the preload pressures.
It was evident that the patient had mild pulmonary hypertension with systolic PA pressures in the 50 to 60 range with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of approximately 25 giving evidence that the etiology of the renal failure was unlikely to be prerenal.
Urine electrolytes, however, did give the appearance of the prerenal failure of being prerenal and for this reason the diagnosis of sclerodermal renal crisis was entertained along with the findings of hypertension.
A renal biopsy was performed on [**3-22**] the results of which were not diagnostic for sclerodermal renal crisis, however, the size of tissue used was likely inadequate.
The recommendation made around the time of the first biopsy was to begin ace inhibitor therapy as this was a treatment of choice for sclerodermal renal crisis and this was continued and a higher dose after the second biopsy results came back with Enalapril intravenous with goals to keep the systolic blood pressure in the range of 100 to 120.
The patient required dialysis as she continued to have volume overload that was not amenable to medical therapy as well as continuously rising BUN and creatinine concerning for uremia.
Treatment was supportive with fresh frozen platelets given for elevated INR and platelets given during periprocedural bleeding.
Treatment was largely supportive with blood products being given for hematocrits that showed evidence of continued decline or hematocrits below 30.
Infectious disease:  Throughout the course of her hospital stay multiple blood cultures were taken, which showed no evidence of bacterial growth in the blood.
There was one bottle also that grew out yeast, however, this was likely also a colonizer as after the line was changed there was no evidence of fungemia by follow up blood cultures or by clinical status.
Posterior oropharyngeal hematoma:  On [**4-2**] the patient began to have some bleeding from her posterior oropharynx during an attempted transesophageal echocardiogram.
The blood had to be transfused as her hematocrit dropped fairly significant.
