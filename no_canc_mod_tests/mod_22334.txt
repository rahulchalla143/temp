Subsequent echocardiogram done at [**Hospital3 1810**]    had concerns for coarctation due to narrowing and the left    superior vena cava draining into the coronary sinus.
The prior ultrasound done at 19    weeks had normal AFI.
No pleural effusions    with a small pericardial effusion noted on the examination    on the day of delivery.
Ultrasound on [**2110-1-7**] revealed more anasarca as well as    pericardial effusion prompting delivery.
Apgars were 3 at one minute, 6 at five minutes, and 7 at 10 minutes.
He was intubated and brought to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further care.

Head circumference is 37 cm which is much greater than 90th percentile.
Length of 45.5 cm which is between the 25th and 50th percentile and weight of 2600 grams which is the 50th percentile.
Four extremity blood pressures revealed right arm systolic blood pressure of 78, right leg systolic blood pressure of 65, left arm systolic blood pressure of 75 and left leg systolic blood pressure of 60.
He has decreased activity with only slight response during examination and minimal spontaneous activity.
Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 with no murmur appreciated.
Examination of the lungs revealed coarse breath sounds.
Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, nondistended.
Initial chest x-ray had no concerns of lung disease.
On    day of life number 7 he developed respiratory    acidosis with an echocardiogram showing significant    pulmonary hypertension.
Follow up    echocardiogram demonstrated no PPHN and his current    settings are 24/6 with a rate of 38, FIO2 between 29 and    35 percent.
His most recent gas was pH of 7.29 with a    pCO2 of 61, pO2 132.
An echocardiogram subsequently showed    decreased biventricular function with a large PDA and no    coarctation visualized.
Therefore, the prostaglandins    were stopped and pre and postductal as well as four    extremity blood pressures were closely monitored.
Serial echos have not    demonstrated evidence of coarctation of the aorta.
His most recent echocardiogram    was on day of life 21 showed moderately depressed right    ventricular function, borderline left ventricular function and    small (1.8 mm) PDA with continuous left to right flow.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient has been    NPO for the majority of the hospital course.
Birth weight was 2600 grams.
Rebound bilirubin have remained normal.
His most recent hematocrit was    51.5 on day of life 22.
His platelet count has been to a    low of 74 on day of life number four.
His cultures remained negative at 48 hours therefore    the antibiotics were discontinued.
When blood cultures were    negative at 48 hours these were discontinued.
Blood cultures were sent which was negative on three    separate occasions.
Viral cultures were sent and were    negative.
CMV, parvovirus, toxoplasma and enterovirus all    returned negative.
On day of life    number one a head ultrasound was performed which showed    mild ventriculomegaly, but no significant hydrocephalus.
On day of life number six an EEG was performed which was also    normal.
On day of life 7 a lumbar puncture was performed    which was also normal.
The patient had a CPK initially which was elevated at    570.
Repeat was 409.
The plan is for a muscle, nerve and skin biopsy on [**2110-1-29**]    at [**Hospital3 1810**].
FISH for    Prader Willi was sent which revealed disomy in chromosome 15    although methylation studies are still pending.
Urine    organic acids showed nonspecific elevations.
From [**1-29**]: ABG 7.29/61/132/35 Na 141 K 5.6 (hemolyzed) Cl 102 DS 102 TG 109 hct 51.5, plt 146, wbc 12.5 (61P/2B/22L) PT 16.4 PTT 48.8 INR 1.7  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Poor.
