CT abd [**8-4**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions and stable parenchymal calcifications which may reflect amiodarone usage.
CXR [**8-4**]: Small right pleural effusion.
Gap in ED was 34 prior to fluids, improved to 19 after 2L NS in ED.
Delta delta is 22, so corrected bicarb is 30 - some component of metabolic alkalosis possibly from vomiting.
Ingestions also a possibility - urine and serum tox negative.
Osmolar gap is 13, typically osmole gap > 10 indicative of ingestion.
ethylene glycol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol level were sent and were unremarkable.
A CT scan showed signs c/w likely cirrhosis.
B12, folate levels were normal.
Coags unremarkable, albumin c/w poor nutritional status.
The patient's cardiac enzymes were negative x3 and EKG not significantly changed from prior EKGs.
On further interview, symptoms suggestive of GERD (typically occur with pepsi, [**Location (un) 2452**] juice, right side chest burning, never elicited by exertion).
His CBC on the day of discharge was 2.5>28.7<81.
Talking to his PCP revealed that the patient's baseline chronically low with his last outpatient CBC being 3.3>29.1<132.
He was referred to a hematologist at [**Hospital6 **] and scheduled for a bone marrow biopsy in [**7-1**] but never followed up.
A CXR showed only a small effusion.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 30623**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 30837**]) on Thursday [**2199-8-15**] at your original appointment time.
