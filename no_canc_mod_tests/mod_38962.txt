She was brought to [**Hospital6 48708**] where she had initial vitals T 97.9, BP 173/76, HR 73, RR 20, exam showed "expressive aphasic," and she was seen to have possible small left temporo-occipital infarct on head CT of undetermined age, and then she was intubated for concerns that she was not able to protect her airway while with nausea/vomiting.

70s RR 20 94% 3LNC I/O (8H) -550 (24H) 1080/400+ BMx2 PE: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress Neck: JVP just below mandible at 30 degrees CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, G2 systolic murmur at RUSB.
[**2124-2-15**]: Echo The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler or bubble study x 3.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).

CT at OSH was concerning for CVA, so was transferred to the neurology service at [**Hospital1 18**].
If her weight continued to decrease or her Cr increases, decreasing her lasix regimen back to her home dose should be considered.
Initial culture from ED grew Proteus.
We completed a CT scan and an MRI during your hospital visit to rule out a stroke due to changes in your speech.
These studies revealed an old stroke.
