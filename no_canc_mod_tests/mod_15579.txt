The patient had a CT angio and her systolic blood pressure was in the 200s.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] whose CT was read as not being appreciably different from the last CT performed on [**2115-4-10**].
The patient was placed on nitroprusside drip, po Labetalol 200 mg a day and was seen by the liver service who performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy to evaluate for guaiac positive stools and hematocrit of 22.8 on presentation.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed varices in the lower third of the esophagus with the middle grade one.
A sigmoidoscopy was performed, which showed spotting from the hemorrhoids.
was started with a goal blood pressure of decreased blood pressure given the dissection.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Her vital signs were temperature 97.
Heart rate of 56 to 60.
Blood pressure 139/60.
Lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Extremities 1+ pedal edema, 2+ sacral edema.
IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate or congestive heart failure.
CT of the pelvis from [**4-10**] showed dissection of lower thoracic abdominal aorta and right common iliac, infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm maximum diameter 5.5 by 5 cm.
LABORATORIES AT [**Hospital1 **]:  White blood cell count 5.2, hematocrit 22.8, platelets 63.
Diff 72.6, lymphocytes 11.1, 106, 2.8.
Electrolytes sodium 135, K 3.3, chloride 103, bicarb 25, BUN 40, creatinine 1.5, glucose 143, INR 1.3, albumin 2.1.
White blood cell [**Pager number **], red blood cell [**Pager number **], polys 6, lymphocytes 28, monocytes 46, eosinophils 1, mesothelial cells 14, macro 15.
Chest x-ray of [**2115-4-20**] showed a 1.1 cm pulmonary nodule right upper lobe, prominent tortuous aorta.
Patient with a history of aortic dissection initially placed on nitroprusside drip for blood pressure control.
It was necessary to maintain a blood pressure so that her aortic dissection would not progress.
On [**2115-4-22**] a repeat chest x-ray was performed.
Further evaluation with a CT was suggested.
The differential included atelectasis versus an evolving pneumonia.
The patient's hematocrit was felt to require an outpatient colonoscopy.
On [**2115-4-21**] an abdominal ultrasound and diagnostic paracentesis was performed, which showed a small 3 cm pocket of ascites located within the right lower quadrant the patient in the sitting position.
An abdominal ultrasound on [**4-22**] was performed.
The impression was a nodular liver consistent with the patient's known cirrhosis, patent flow to the liver, borderline enlarged spleen, mild ascites and abdominal portion of the aortic dissection seen in the dissection consistent with both CT and MR recently with correlation of the studies was suggested.
A renal ultrasound was performed on [**5-23**].
The ultrasound showed color flow seen to both kidneys, but the wave form is parvus sitarist suggesting more proximal stenosis in both renal arteries.
The patient's creatinine on presentation was 1.5.
