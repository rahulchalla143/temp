However, due to large size of hematoma, an underlying mask or an abnormality could not be completely excluded and followup study is recommended.
MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA demonstrates somewhat tortuous intracranial arteries.
Head CT: 1.
Patient's labs were concerning for sepsis, although there was no clear source.
HOB at 30 degrees and performed Q1h neuro checks.
Continued phenytoin and checked a level which was therapeutic.
Chest x-ray was negative for an acute cardiopulmonary process.
Blood cultures were pending.
KUB was negative for obvious obstruction or perforation.
Liver function tests were within normal limits as well as lipase.
MRI brain was obtained did not show enhancing lesion but could not exclude underlying mass given the extent of the hemorrhage.
A repeat head CT the following morning showed worsening subfalcine and uncal herniation with increased associated edema.
Patient's clinical exam was also worsened fixed right pupil and decreased movement in his extremities.
