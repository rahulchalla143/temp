He was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**2194-9-30**] CT Torso  1.
[**2194-9-30**] CT LUE  1.
MR examination of the left wrist would provide further imaging evaluation if clinically warranted.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
[**2194-10-10**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Though there has been interval resolution of a left pneumothorax from [**9-30**], there is little change in segmental atelectasis at the bilateral lower lobes.
He underwent CT imaging showing fracture of the right lateral aspect of the T12 vertebral body.
Echo and CXR were unremarkable, but he required ongoing pressor support with Levophed until [**10-2**].
As his respiratory status improved, his blood pressure stabilized.
On his initial CT, there were large dependant fluid collections which were read as likely atelectasis, but were somewhat concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
On HD 3, he began to exhibit symptoms of ARDS, and his CXR was in keeping with this finding.
Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed for persistent RLL collapse on [**9-27**] and culture was positive for acid-fast bacilli.
On [**9-30**], a repeat CXR revealed increase in a left subpulmonic pneumothorax and a second, posterior chest tube was placed with satisfactory resolution.
Repeat bronchoscopy was performed on [**10-1**] for RLL collapse on chest CT, with purulent sputum aspirated and sent for culture.
He continued to be weaned off his oxygen requirement, until he was on room air and oxygen saturations were above > 90%.
Heme/ID:  His WBC began to climb though he did not spike any fevers and none of his cultures came back positive as of HD 5.
He did have a bronch on [**9-27**] which showed non-anthracis bacillus.
AFB+ culture data did not reveal TB.
His temperature curve was monitored after this.
His  oxygen requirement was weaned to room air and his oxygen saturations were kept above > 90%.
