Prenatal screens - A positive, antibody negative, hepatitis C surface antigen negative, Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, Group B Streptotoccus unknown.
Antenatal echocardiogram revealed aortic stenosis, bicommissural, thickened and dysplastic aortic valve, increasingly dilated ventricles with poor ventricular wall motion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Respiratory - Initially infant was well appearing in no respiratory distress, with post ductal saturations 40% in room air.
Due to post ductal saturations 40%, and apnea, the infant was intubated with a 3.5 French endotracheal tube secured at 9 cm.
A chest radiograph after intubation showed 8 rib expansion bilaterally, increased cardiac silhouette, diffuse opacification consistent with surfactant deficiency.
In light of the desaturation and radiographic appearance, initial dose of Surfactant was administered with good response and oxygen saturation were 95%.
Preductal saturations were 85% prior to Surfactant administration.
The infant was on ventilator, placed on ventilator settings of positive inspiratory pressure 26, positive end-expiratory pressure 5, rate 25 with oxygen saturation to keep above preductal saturations, 85 to 90%.
An arterial blood gases drawn after Surfactant administration showed a pH of 6.94, carbon dioxide 56, pAO2 39, pCO2 of 13, base excess -23.
At that time, ventilator settings were increased from a rate of 25 to 35 and positive inspiratory pressure was increased from 26 to 28 and the infant received 2 mEq/kg of sodium bicarbonate.
Cardiovascular - Initial blood pressure 55/24 with a mean blood pressure of 35.
Heartrate 160 to 180, murmur present.
PGE 1 was started at .05 mcg/kg/min and were increased to .1 mcg/kg/min.
Blood pressure means remained 35 to 40.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The infant was currently NPO and was started on D10/W 80 cc/kg/day intravenously.
