Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension  Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2105-9-21**], a slightly higher aortic valve gradient is now measured (likely related to slightly better technical quality of Doppler spectral measurement in the current study).
Left ventricular systolic function and mitral valve appear similar.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2105-10-3**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Found to have NSTEMI, with a positive troponin of 0.12 and was admitted for cardiac cath.
On cardiac cath [**9-18**] she was found to have an ulcerated 80% lesion in the proximal SV to LAD graft.
Limited resting hemodynamics showed elevated central aortic pressures (200/65mmHg).
LV gram was not performed due to renal insufficiency.
She was felt to be fluid overloaded and a CXR was consistent with florid CHF.
Her cardiac enzymes were also elevated overnight post-cath and this was felt to be possibly related to showering of microemboli from her SVG into her microvasculature.
Re-look cath on [**9-23**] showed the LCX to have serial 70% lesions at the mid-segment.
JVP was up at 10cm's and she had crackles on exam to apices with decreased air movement at the bases.
NTG x 3 was given with sub-total relief of symptoms.
EKG was performed and showed no evidence of acute MI (in the setting of baseline LBBB).
ABG demonstrated 7.23/65/66 with bicarb of 21, c/w an acute respiratory acidosis.
Of note, she was found to have evidence as well of a new LLL pneumonia by CXR ,with a WBC of 15.6, and was started on Levaquin/Flagyl.
Subsequent hemodialysis was well tolerated with maintenance of her blood pressures.
She has been on room air and maintaining sats >93% since return from CCU on [**10-1**].
She was subsequently started on Levo/Flagyl for infiltrate on CXR and elevated WBC.
Repeat urine cultures demonstrated E.coli R to levaquin/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was started on Gent at 100mg Bolus, + 60mgQHD x 1 week for uncomplicated E.Coli UTI.
PTH elevated, likely secondary to ESRD, but will need outpatient follow-up to check Vitamin D levels and potentially a Parathyroid U/S to evaluate for adenoma.
CT abdomen/pelvis negative for bleed.
