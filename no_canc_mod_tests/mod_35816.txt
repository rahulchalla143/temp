Compared to the previous tracing of [**2163-7-11**] no diagnostic interim change.
[**2163-7-29**] CXR: In comparison with previous study of [**7-27**], there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with continued small bilateral effusions in a patient with intact sternal sutures and previous CABG and valve replacement.
Although all this could represent atelectatic change, in view of the clinical history, the possibility of a supervening consolidation cannot be definitely excluded.
Compared with the prior intraoperative study (images reviewed) of [**2162-8-16**], the findings are similar.
Blood cultures were positive for VISA.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 y/o WF with PMH significant for ESRD on HD, systolic CHF with EF 25-30%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation initially admitted to hospital with CHF exacerbation, now with VISA line related bacteremia (6/6 bottles).
# VISA bacteremia/sepsis: Patient spiked fever on [**7-27**], blood cultures drawn which grew GPCs in pairs and clusters and was intially started on vancomycin.
She had a TEE negative for any vegetations.
However, when blood cx from [**2163-8-2**] cont to grow VISA the line was removed on [**8-4**] and patient given 72 hr line holiday.
Blood cultures have remained no growth since [**2163-8-8**].
She will need weekly CK checked while on Daptomycin.
[**Date range (3) **] in [**10-13**] showed EF of 25-30% and a repeat [**Date Range 113**] during admission showed severely reduced global systolic function.
Pneumonia was unlikely given lack of cough, fever, leukocytosis, or focal CXR findings.
ACS was unlikely given lack of acute changes on EKG and stable cardiac enzymes.
Her dyspnea responded well to dialysis treatment and her oxygen saturation remained stabely in the high 90's on [**1-7**] liters of oxygen.
Would suggest restarting metoprolol succinate in the future if blood pressure can tolerate this.
# Anemia: Hematocrit levels were measured daily and a slow trending down was noted.
Iron studies pending at time of discharge which renal has agreed to follow as pt may require IV iron with HD.
Would suggest restarting  metoprolol succinate when blood pressure can tolerate this.
