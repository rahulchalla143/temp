Lyme serology negative Urine culture [**6-23**] negative Wound swab from R amputated toe [**6-30**]: no growth, no microorganisms on gram stain  IMAGING: TTE [**2131-6-25**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The IVC is small, consistent with an RA pressure of <10mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-5-10**], global left ventricular sysotlic function is now slightly reduced with preserved systolic function.
The heart rate is also now tachycardic.
CT CHEST [**2131-6-25**]: FINDINGS: Normal appearance of the visualized thyroid.
Limited, non-contrast evaluation of the upper abdomen reveals no gross abnormality.
Blood pool is hypodense relative to myocardium suggesting anemia.
Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates normal overall parenchymal pattern with focal areas of scattered ground-glass opacity in the bilateral upper and lower lobes, most prominent in the left upper lobe.
Lack of IV contrast prevents evaluation of the pulmonarey vessels for embolus.
Evaluation of the extensor and flexor tendons as well as limited evaluation of the intrinsic ligaments of the foot demonstrates no acute abnormality.
Limited evaluation of the mid foot also demonstrates no acute pathology.
Although initial concern was for septic arthritis, tap by orthopedics only showed a few drops of bloody fluid that was not sent for lab evaluation.
Another MRI was obtained on [**2131-7-2**] that included all portions of the right foot, as parts of the foot, notably the amputated 5th metatarsal, were not obtained on the prior MRI, which was again negative for osteomyelitis.
Blood cultures 8/4, [**6-24**], [**6-26**], and [**6-29**] and urine culture [**6-23**] showed no growth.
His creatinine level was around ~1.7 a few months ago, but hovered around ~2.5 for much of his admission.
His labs were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, with no evidence of hemolysis.
# Elevated Troponin (Not NSTEMI): While in the MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 33020**] cardiac enzymes revealed a mildly elevated Tn-T in the setting of CKD, but his CM-MB was normal.
A TTE was performed that demonstrated normal LV function without any regional wall motion abnormalities.
Labetolol was added to help with his blood pressure control.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
