CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2180-4-29**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2180-4-28**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
Testing of repeat isolates may be warranted.
Air-fluid levels cannot be assessed.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25%) with inferior/inferolateral akinesis/severely hypokinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[**2180-5-11**]: LVOT VTI in baseline pacing mode = 10.7 cm RV pacing alone: LVOT VTI = 11.5 cm LV-RV 10 msec offset: LVOT VTI = 12.8 cm LV-RV 20 msec offset: LVOT VTI = 13.3 cm LV tip to ring (LV-RV offset 0 msec): LVOT VTI = 14.0 cm LV tip to ring (LV-RV offset 30 msec): LVOT VTI = 12.3 cm LV ring to RV coil (LV-RV offset 0 msec): LVOT VTI = 13.2 cm LV ring to RV coil (LV-RV offset 30 msec): LVOT VTI = 11.2 cm LV tip to RV coil (LV-RV offset 0 msec): LVOT VTI = 13.3 msec     Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old male with PMHx of severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, s/p ICD placement [**2175**], mild-mod MR/TR, DM, ICD, Afib on coumadin, gout, hypothyroidism, CKD p/w vtach and ICD firing, also with decompensated CHF.
ECHO on [**5-11**] evaluated his heart function after change in lead placement and it showed marked improvement in squeeze of his vintricles.
To increase efficiency of systolic function and increase time in BiV pacing, he was betablocked with metoprolol and his pacemaker rate was increased to 80.
Weaning his pressors proved to be a challenge however and were kept on for several days.
A repeat ECHO on milrinone showed slightly improved EF to 20-25%.
Initially his BP remained low and Creatinine began trending up.
His BP improved as well as his creatinine.
On coumadin at home, however INR supratherapeutic at 4.0 so was held on admission.
His coumadin was held and on the day of discharge his INR was 3.1.
He will have his INR checked at Rehab and they will restart his coumadin at 2mg when his INR is between [**3-2**].
Repeat TSH was 24.
