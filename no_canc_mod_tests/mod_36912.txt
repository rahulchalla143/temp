Patient initially presented to OSH, had CT chest that did not demonstrate signs of infection and was discharged.
As symptoms continued to worsen he presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.
On initial presentation to ED, vital signs were 97.3 93 139/68 18 100% RA.
Exam was significant for crackles and systolic murmur.
Labs were significant for WBC15.9, Hct37.4, Cr2.1 (no prior), Trop<.01, BNP5903, Ddimer2916.
EKG w L atrial abnormality (?p-mitrale), peaked twaves in precordials w ST changes.
OSH CT scan was re-read and w/o sign of PE.
CXR did not demonstrate any acute process.

The estimated right atrial pressure is [**4-26**] mmHg.Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function (LVEF >55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were all normal in appearence.
Resting hemodynamcis revealed  mildly elevated right and severly elevated left ventricular filling pressures, with a RVEDP of 16mmHg and an LVEDP of 28mmHg.
Significantly depressed cardiac function, with an cardiac index of 1.6 L/min/m2.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Overall left ventricular function improved though inferior hypokinesis and septal dyskinesis remained - ejection fraction approximated 40-45%.
The maximum gradient across the mitral valve was 5 with a mean of 3 at a cardiac output of 5 liters/minute.
Ischemia was ruled out as cause of this event with negative cardiac enzymes and no ECG evidence of ischemia.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed a partial mitral leaflet flail, torn mitral chordae, and an eccentric mitral regurgitation jet with severe (4+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] prior to cardiac catheteriation, patient developed respiratory distress and became less responsive.
He required intubation and transfered to cath lab where catheterization revealed no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease, cardiogenic shock with elevated biventricular filling pressures and severe pulmonary hypertension.
He remained in a normal sinus rhythm and no further episodes of atrial fibrillation were noted.
