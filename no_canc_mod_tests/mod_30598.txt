Her BNP was around 5800 and exam remarkable for LE edema.
An echo was ordered for further evaluation of her cardiac function.
Initially it was felt that a bacterial pneumonia and asthma/COPD exacerbation could be contributing to her dyspnea, so the patient received initial doses of levofloxacin and prednisone, but these were soon discontinued when it was clear that a viral etiology and CHF were the more likely precipitants.
Prior to arrival on the floor, she had been adequately diuresed in the MICU, and her creatinine bumped as a result of the diuresis.
Her exam improved and she was titrated off of supplemental O2 over 2 [**Known lastname **].
Her warfarin was held initially as her INR climbed to above 6 after receving the dose of levofloxacin.
