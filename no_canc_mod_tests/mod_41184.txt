[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10502**] DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   Brief Hospital Course: 85F who presented to an OSH after a fall, on Coumadin, CT showed a R SDH and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
On initial examination, her exam was stable, however, she decompensated while in the ER and required to go to the OR emergently.
Post-op imaging was stable with expected post-op changes.
Her exam was improved from the day prior.
Her Dilantin level corrected was 19.1 and one dose was held.
Overnight on [**7-10**] into [**7-11**] she became tachycardic to the 130s.
CT head showed a new Right SDH and new right IPH but improvement in MLS.
She continued to aspirate on repeat Speach and Swallow evaluation on [**7-13**].
Respiratory was called and patient was placed on 2L O2 and saturation was improved.
A CXR was ordered to evaluate for PNA and a NGT was placed for medication and food administration.
Video swallow evaluation was performed on [**7-18**] and demonstrated moderate-severe pharyngeal dysphagia primarily characterized by risk of aspiration with all PO intake due to swallow initiation delay, reduced laryngeal valve closure, and residue mixing with secretions.
Information was obtained from Family/Caregiver.
