He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-21**] for further monitoring.
Creatinine was noted to be elevated (to as high as 5), and a temporary HD [**Last Name (un) **] was placed on [**2167-4-24**] (R IJ) for initiation of HD; prior to this, pt had been managed without dialysis.
He was given lasix (20mg, then 40 mg, IV lopressor), EKG demonstrated TWI/ST depre in anterolateral distribution (similar to admit EKG).
Cardiac enzymes have been repeatedly negative.
Repeat TTE and diuresis (lasix and nitro gtt) were also recommended.
CRI, b/l creatinine 2.6-2.8, was not previously on HD; nephrologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 34543**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 34544**]), PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 34545**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 34546**]) 3.

Please see torso CT from today for further evaluation of the lungs.
[**2167-4-21**] X-ray Knees - 1) No acute fracture is detected.
[**2167-4-21**] Femur X-ray - 1) No acute fracture is detected.
[**2167-4-21**] CT Torso - 1.
Evaluation for parenchymal disruption is not possible due to lack of IV contrast, and correlation to the prior outside CT with contrast should be made to [**Month/Day/Year 11197**] the degree of parenchymal disruption.
Trace left apical pneumothorax, although better visualized on the prior cervical spine CT than on this study.
[**2167-4-21**] ECHO - The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function appears to be at least moderately depressed; the inferior and anterior walls, as well as apex, appear hypokinetic.
[**2167-4-29**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed with inferior and infero-lateral akinesis including the infero-apex.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-4-21**], the findings are probably similar.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 59 yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG in [**2161**], DM, htn, CRI with baseline scr in the 2's who was taken to [**Hospital1 5979**] Hosp [**4-21**] after he was involved in a MVA.
CXR showed changes c/w failure (new from prior CXR).
EKG at that time demonstrated TWI/ST depressions in an anterolateral distribution, but this was unchaged from his admit EKG.
His symptoms improved s/p HD and diuresis (received lasix 20 mg, then 40 mg, in acute setting of SOB).
His cardiac enzymes at that time were negative and cardiology recommended optimizing medical mgt with beta blockade, ASA, statin, plavix when hct stable (ddx NSTEMI vs. cardiac contusion from trauma).
Patient's Cr trended up to a peak of 5 during his admission, which is well above his baseline.
He ended up needing 2 sessions of dilaysis for fluid overload after which his creatinine trended back to baseline.
Pt's cks were elevated early on and troponin continued to trend up during his stay with a peak of 1.28 on the day of discharge.
He had anterolateral ST depressions/TWI on his EKG at admission and a ?new anterior hypokinesis on echo.
Cholesterol levels were checked and his statin was increased to 40mg.
His hct was followed and he require a transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs.
His hct remained stable after that.
