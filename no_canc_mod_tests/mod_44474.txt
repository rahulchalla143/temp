Initial EKG demonstrated STE in V2-V4, which was unchanged from prior.
Family History: see above  Physical Exam: Vitals - T 96.7, HR 60 (paced), BP 127/57, RR 16, O2 97% on 2L NC General - awake, alert, pleasant, lying flat, NAD HEENT - PERRL, EOMI, MMM Neck - flat JVP Chest - R chest wall with bandage/temporary pacer in place.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: ECHOCARDIOGRAM: .
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of all segments except the basal inferior, posterior, and lateral walls (the anterior septum is extensively scarred/fibrotic and akinetic); the apex is dyskinetic.
There she underwent a VT ablation.
She transiently went into complete heart block during the procedure and was noted to have an H-V conduction time of 140msec.
She returned to the EP lab on [**5-6**] for a study to assess her H-V conduction.
Her temp wire was pulled and a permanent pacer was not placed.
She did not have CP while in the CCU  C. Pump: Pt w/ ECHO on [**2143-5-2**] that demonstrates EF of 30%.
