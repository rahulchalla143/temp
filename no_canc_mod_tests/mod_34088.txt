She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and had an echo which showed severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] <0.8cm2) with preserved systolic function, AR (1+), MR (2+), TR (2+) and severe PAH.
Labs were notable for Creat 3.35 (up from 2.31 on [**8-11**]), BNP 702, CK 153, trop 0.64.
EKG showed sinus tach.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: off-pump CABG x 2: Saphenous vein grafted to LAD and saphenous vein graft to PDA -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: PCI and stentx3 (?BMS) to RCA ([**2145**]) PTCA to LAD ([**2138**]) Aortic stenosis Carotid stenosis status post right carotid endarterectomy [**2137**] Chronic kidney disease (unknown baseline Creat) Left subclavian steal syndrome Glaucoma Sleep apnea (no longer uses CPAP)  Past surgical history: Tonsillectomy, Left ankle repair, Right carpal tunnel release, Total abdominal hysterectomy, Laser eye surgery, CABG as above   Social History: Non-smoker, rare brandy, no drugs.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: VS on transfer: T= 96.1 BP= 152/61 HR=88 RR=19 O2 sat= 95% on CPAP (50% FIO2) GENERAL: Pleasant, comfortable-appearing, in no acute distress.
NECK: Supple with 10cm JVP .
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+  Discharge Physical Exam: Patient delirious, not oriented.
On high flow face mask with good oxygen saturations Cardiac exam unchanged.
Lungs continue to be wheezy on exam with elevated JVP  Pertinent Results: Admission labs: WBC 5.6  Hgb 9.6 Hct 27.5 Plts 211 PT 11.4 PTT 25.7  INR 0.9  Na 140 K 4.7 Cl 99 CO2 23 BUN 70 Cr 4.2 Gluc 209 Ca 8.4 Mag 2.2 Phos 5.2 CK 164 CKMB 12 Trop-T 0.53  ALT 17 AST 32 Alk phos 133 T bili 0.4  Admission studies: CXR: Moderate pulmonary edema, worsened in comparison to prior study from [**2156-8-12**].
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-8-12**], no change (the [**Location (un) 109**] was slightly underestimated and regional antero-lateral hypokinesis was present but not commented on for the prior study).
CXR [**2156-8-24**]: Diffuse hazy opacification with cardiomegaly are consistent with pulmonary edema, unchanged in appearance from the prior examination.
Pertinent Labs:  Renal function pre-CVVHD: [**2156-8-18**] 07:08PM BLOOD UreaN-98* Creat-6.4*  Renal function Post-CVVHD: [**2156-8-20**] 09:59AM BLOOD UreaN-23* Creat-2.0* [**2156-8-21**] 05:15AM BLOOD UreaN-33* Creat-3.0* [**2156-8-23**] 03:57AM BLOOD UreaN-55* Creat-3.7* [**2156-8-24**] 05:16AM BLOOD UreaN-65* Creat-4.0* [**2156-8-25**] 05:45AM BLOOD UreaN-78* Creat-4.6* [**2156-8-26**] 04:59AM BLOOD UreaN-86* Creat-5.0*  Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 83yoF with h/o severe aortic stenosis and [**Hospital **] transfered from OSH for SOB [**2-4**] flash edema from AS.
Review of her echo demonstrated that her MR was more significant than AS and she would likely get little benefit from intervention on her aortic valve.
Her isosorbide mononitrate CR was initally increased to 90mg daily, then reduced to 60mg daily as above.
Creatinine continued to trend upwards and patient continued to have poor urine output.
# Hypertension: BP stable on home amlodipine, and metoprolol.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Patient's blood sugar was well controlled throughout admission on home lantus and insulin sliding scale.
