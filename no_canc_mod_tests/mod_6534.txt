58 RHW with HTN was brought to the ED for evaluation of sudden onset left sided weakness and dysarthria.
Patient was significantly hypertensive (BP above 200/100) and CT head showed bleed in right thalamus.
ICU course was complicated by VAP per [**8-3**] sputum Cx and was treated with 14 days of broad spectrum antibiotics.
Initial head CT at [**Hospital6 1597**] showed 2x2cm R thalamic hemorrhage.
At [**Hospital1 18**], head CT showed enlargement to 3.6 x 2.8 cm with lateral and 4th intraventricular extension and new mild leftward shift of midline structures.
Patient was significantly hypertensive (BP above 200/100) and ICH was felt to be a primary hypertensive bleed.
Initial ED neuro exam was significant for agitation and yelling but not following commands, and L hemiparesis of face, arm and leg.
Repeat head CT showed interval enlargement of ICH and neurosurgery was consulted emergently.
The patient's neuro exam improved so that she was alert and able to follow commands on R side when off sedation.
Lipid panel showed Chol 219 and LDL 149.
CV: BP was initially controlled with nicardipine drip.
ENT was consulted for evaluation but they saw no structural damage to the cartilage.
Treated for VAP since [**8-6**] and sputum from [**8-3**] grew pseudomonas sensitive to cefepime and received a 14 day total antibiotic course.
High urine Osm 616 vs serum Osm 270 UNa 117.
# ID: The patient was noted to be febrile with leukocytosis [**7-31**].
She was pan-cultured but all cultures were negative.
On [**8-3**] a sputum culture grew pseudomonas.
Blood glucose monitored and remained controlled on HIS.
