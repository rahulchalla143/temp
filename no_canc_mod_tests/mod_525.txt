Although, based on his lung exam with wheezing and rhonchi, it was felt that there was also a COPD component to the patient's dyspnea.
A CXR revealed bilateral opacification consistent pulmonary edema or new LUL infiltrate.
[**Name (NI) 6**] outpatient workup for OSA might be reasonable for this patient.
Echo done on [**2145-7-7**] showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hyopokinesis, and moderate mitral regurgitation.
His initial chemistry panel revealed a sodium of 119.
The patient's sodium levels began to normalize with diuresis.
His antihypertensives other than lasix continued to be held in the setting of aggressive diuresis and low normal blood pressure, but lisinopril in particular should likely be restarted once his blood pressure returns to higher levels.
# Anticoagulation - Because of his mechanical aortic valve, the patient has a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
After some adjustments, it was decided to keep the patient on the heparin drip until he reached his goal PTT of 60-80.
Coumadin was restarted at 5mg and then raised to 7.5mg, and the patient's INR rose to 1.9 at the time of discharge.
His blood sugars varied during his hospitalization but generally were <200.
