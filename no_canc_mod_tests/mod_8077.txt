GRAM STAIN (Final [**2141-6-10**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):       PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.
Rads: [**6-1**] KUB - ileus [**6-2**] - Abd U/S - no ascites, possible cirrhosis [**6-2**] - CT abd - Small bowel dilatation up to 4.2 cm with relatively decompressed distal loops of small bowel and colon - pSBO vs. ileus, cholelithiasis [**6-4**] - KUB/CXR - free air under L hemidiaphragm and dilated SB up to 5 cm with decompressed loops distally.
Pathology Examination Procedure date     [**2141-6-4**] DIAGNOSIS: Ascending colon, segmented resection: 1.
Acute Polyarticular Arthritis: although joint distribution is not classic, polys and needle shaped crystals and negative gram stain on microscopy of joint fluid is c/w gout.
Liquid tumor is less likely, but must be considered, especially if WBC not responding to managements directed at inflammation.
Patient's WBC count initially trended down.
Had some loose stool so sent for C. Diff although abdominal exam benign, and no known recent antibiotic exposure prior to presentation.
Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase was elevated - not c/w CML.
Acute renal failure: BUN:Cr ratio > 20:1 and pt has not been taking adequate po x5 days, highly suggestive of prerenal azotemia.
Transfused for Hct <21 with appropriate increase to 25%.
monitored per CIWA scale protocol- no signs of withdrawal noted during admission.
On [**2141-6-4**] General Surgery consulted for complaints of abdominal distension and emesis - treated as an ileus with an NGT and had dark bilious output from the NGT - put out 1-2 liters per day.
Today with free air under the diaphragm per CT scan.
Abdomen was benign at the time, but steroid managment makes abdominal exam unreliable.
His abdominal dressing remained CDI.
There was no increase in WBC or development of fever.
