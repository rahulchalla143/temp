An additional cyst is seen within the left epididymis tail.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**2172-7-9**] CT abdomen and pelvis .
Resistive indices in the upper left and lower poles of the left kidney are 0.79 and 0.62 respectively.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CTA CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS ON [**2174-5-12**]  FINDINGS: There is an intimal flap seen within the aortic arch originating at the level of the right common carotid artery and crossing the ostia of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries extending through the thoracic aorta through the abdomen beyond the bifurcation into the external iliac vessels.
There is likely hypoperfusion of the right kidney which is supplied by the false lumen; however, early arterial phase imaging precludes evaluation of the renal parenchyma.
Radiology Report MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-5-12**] 11:21 AM Final Report MRI OF THE THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT GADOLINIUM.
Comparison is made with prior C-spine study from [**2172-7-11**].
[**2174-5-12**] SCHED CHEST (PA & LAT) Final Report FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest radiographs are reviewed without comparison.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2174-5-12**]  3:59:18 AM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-8-14**] upward bowing of ST segment elevations in lead V2-V4 is no longer present.
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2174-5-12**] Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
HIs exam was notable for slight TTP at T8-9, normal neuro exam, normal testicular exam with no hernia.
ECG demonstrated NSR at 87 bpm, notched p-waves (old), LVH (old), biphasic T-waves in lateral leads (new).
His BP rose to a peak of 226/143 with HR 95, which was managed initially with labetalol 20mg IV boluses.
He had wbc 15.9, 87% PMN.
He was in acute on chronic renal failure with BUN/Cr of 32/2.9 from baseline creatinine 1.5.
CK was in 700s with negative -MB fraction.
Urinalysis was negative for infection, though with spot protein of 100, which is more than baseline.
CXR was clear, with no evidence of mediastinal widening.
MRI was attempted, but patient could not tolerate due to anxiety and discomfort.
BP control switched to esmolol, BP was 153/89 at time of transfer.
TEE showed Debakey type 2 Aortic dissection, involving aortic arch and extending all the way down to bifurcation.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] service and CT Surgery/Dr.
BP was aggressively controlled with titrating Nitro and Esmolol drips with target BP 100-120.
Creatinine 2.8->2.9.
BP in good control with current meds.CTA  showed-Type A aortic dissection originating at the level of the right common carotid and extending to the bilateral external iliac arteries, with thrombus seen within these vessels.
There is likely hypoperfusion of the right kidney which is supplied by the false lumen; however, early arterial phase imaging precludes evaluation of the renal parenchyma.
Serial HCT followed.
Creatinine 2.9.
HD5 [**5-16**] BP well controlled on Labetolol, Clinidine but still requiring Hydralazine IV prn.
HD6 [**5-17**] Good BP control.
Creatinine peaked at 3.6->2.8.
Appointment arranged with new PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the [**Company 191**] on [**2174-6-7**] for BP management.
Patient will have blood pressure monitored at [**Hospital 577**] Clinic and Cr checked there tomorrow.
