CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2111-10-21**] 11:56 AM IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous but relatively low-attenuation extraaxial collection, layering over the right cerebral convexity, likely representing a subacute subdural hematoma (or reflecting underlying profound anemia), with possible small foci of acute hemorrhage, anteriorly.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2111-10-23**] 10:43 AM IMPRESSION: Status post evacuation of the right frontoparietal subdural hematoma.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2111-10-24**] 4:46 PM IMPRESSION: Stable post-surgical changes within the right cerebral hemisphere from evacuation of subdural hematoma.
