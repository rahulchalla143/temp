In the next few days, the following tests were performed:  A right upper extremity ultrasound which did not show any evidence of a deep venous thrombosis; a CT scan of the chest did not show any evidence of a pulmonary embolism, and a chest x-ray, although showing left heart failure and pulmonary edema, did not show any evidence of aspiration.
An MRI of the head was obtained which, although did not show any acute infarction, showed evidence of chronic microvascular ischemia within the cerebellum and basal ganglion.
On physical examination over the next few days, the patient still was not responsive.
