He presented on [**2150-7-14**] with intermittent chest pressure since that morning.
The shortness of breath lasted 1 hour, at which time chest pressure diminished in intensity.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital Signs:  Temperature 98.1, heart rate 70, blood pressure is 135/92, respirations 16, and O2 saturation 98 percent on room air.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  CBC, white blood cell count 11.4, hematocrit 32.2, platelets 323.
Differential is, neutrophils 81 percent, lymphocytes 11 percent.
Chem-7, sodium 130, potassium 4.1, chloride 93, bicarbonate 25, BUN 29, creatinine 1.4, and glucose 94.
Cardiac markers, CK 212, MB 6, and troponin 0.14.
RADIOLOGY DATA:  Chest x-ray reveals interval development of polychamber cardiomegaly versus pericardial effusion, no pulmonary edema.
AVL unchanged, ST elevations to V1 to V3, which are unchanged.
Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 20 percent.
CT scan with nonionic contrast revealed a left-sided anterior mediastinal mass, contiguous and inseparable from the pericardial effusion.
Also discovered on CT scan was an abdominal aortic aneurysm, infrarenal in position and extended into the common iliac arteries.
Pericardial biopsy was sent to pathology and a caseating mediastinal mass was noted in the findings of this procedure.
They suggested that he may be a candidate for an endovascular AAA repair, but would need a CT angiogram protocol to study and assess the position/size of the AAA.
Immunohisto chemistry shows that the tumor cells are focally positive for CD5 and are negative for TTF1.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping was interpreted as a non- diagnostic study due to the paucity of specimen.
A cytology report for the pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells.
Because of the caseating mass found during the surgery, tuberculosis was suspected, although all of the cultures were negative.
FURTHER WORKUP:  Because the pathologic specimens were nondiagnostic and the bilateral pulmonary nodules were not biopsied at that time, a decision was made in cooperation with Medical service as well as the consulting Oncology service to perform a video-assisted wedge resection of at least 1 of the nodules for definitive diagnosis.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with 50 cc of blood loss.
He was transferred to the Thoracic Surgery service on [**2150-7-31**], and continued to be followed daily by chest x-ray and manipulation of the Pleur-evac to and from wall suction and water seal.
The following day, [**2150-8-5**], it put out 35 cc and the following day, [**2150-8-6**], it put out nothing.
On [**2150-8-7**], the patient's chest tube was converted to a Heimlich valve and was placed to a Foley bag.
He will also be scheduled for a PET scan in the interim between his discharge and his outpatient appointments.
