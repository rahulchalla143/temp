He was tx for a LLL infiltrate (MRSA PNA) and finished a 10 day course of linezolid (vanco allergy), levofloxacin and metronidazole for presumed aspiration pneumonia).
On [**5-17**] he was transferred to the MICU for hypotension and an elevated wbc count (21).
The fever workup was most notable for an abdominal CT which revealed a fluid collection in the bilateral obturator muscles, for which he underwent an IR guided biopsy on [**5-26**].
His labs that day were also notable for an increase in the WBC from 10 to 23.
He was given 2 L NS on the floor, with an improvement of his BP to 98 systolic and persistent tachycardia to 120's.
He received 5.5 L total of NS in the MICU with his BP now stable in the 110's systolic.

NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is a small oval hyperdensity seen within the left putamen with surrounding lucency likely indicating intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
[**6-9**] - CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated are bilateral fluid collections tracking beneath the fascia of the obturator internus muscles bilaterally.
The rectum and visualized distal large bowel is normal.
[**6-2**] - CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter is again seen within the bladder lumen.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance to the bilateral fluid collections adjacent to the obturator internus muscles.
[**5-25**] - CT OF THE PELVIS: IMPRESSION: 1) Bilateral peripherally enhancing fluid collections, likely abscesses, tracking beneath the fascia of the obturator internus muscles as described above.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 59 y/o male with history of multiple sclerosis, initially admitted to the neurology service when found to have bilateral basal gangila hemorrhages, and then transferred to the medicine service when found to have persistent fevers and subsequently bilateral obturator abscesses of unknown etiology.
PPD in-house was negative.
On [**5-25**], pt underwent repeat CT scn of the Pelvis which revealed bilateral peripherally enhancing fluid collections tracking beneath the fascia of the obturator internus muscle bilaterally, tracking from its origin anteriorly along the surface of the obturator membrane to its insertion posteriorly along the medial surface of the greater trochanter of the femur.
On [**5-26**], he underwent CT guided drainage of the right abscess which yielded 10cc of blood and pus sent to the lab for cultures.
The abscess culture grew out Bacteroides fragilis.
Repeat CT scans on [**6-2**] and [**6-9**] show decreased size of the bilateral abscesses.
The patient is scheduled to have repeat imaging on [**6-25**] of the OI abscesses and scheduled to see Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4334**] in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**7-8**], who at that time will determine the duration of the antibiotics.
# Intracranial hemorrhage - Head CT performed at [**Hospital1 18**] was consistent with a left basal ganglia bleed.
On initial neurological exam, mental status exam was notable for inattention.
Cranial nerve exam notable for right sided skew, abduction paresis, and facial palsy.
Lower extremity exam with paraparesis, worsened from last reported exam by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
MRI was performed and although limited by motion artifact, revealed no evidence of underlying mass.
There, he initially did well, but had an episode of decreased responsiveness which prompted a repeat CT of the head.
After this event, it was noted that the patient's blood pressures were in the 170-180's systolic.
However, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed and ruled out cardiac valvular vegetations as a source of embolus.
In addition, a CT venogram of the head was performed and ruled out venous sinus thrombosis as a cause.
The pt's blood pressure was subsequently well-controlled with metoprolol.
His neurologic exam also has remained stable.
His blood pressures have remained stable off of antihypertensives, which were discontinued due to his hypotension during sepsis episodes.
PTH, vitamin D levels, and 24-hour urine were all consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism - elevated PTH, elevated serum Ca, normal vitamin D levels, and urine Ca>300.
He needs to have a PTH and calcium checked on [**2117-6-14**].
The initial workup was negative for toxic-metabolic or infectious etiologies.
UA and CXR as well as blood cultures failed to demonstrate any infection that could have precipitated encephalopathy.
The patient was briefly on acyclovir and ampicillin to empirically cover HSV and listeria until cx and HSV pcr came back negative.
Abdominal CT demonstrated possible left obturator internus muscle abscess, but attempted drainage by IR could not aspirate fluid.
He can get a video swallow for further evaluation at rehab if needed.
Anemia/Guaiac positive stool: The patient does have guaiac postive stools and Hct dropped to 19 at one point in the MICU thought to be secondary to fluids, requiring 2 units of PRBCs, however, no urgent scope was felt necessary and CT of abdomen did not reveal any hematoma.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
His hematocrit eventually stabilized once on the floor.
His blood pressure was eventually well-controlled with metoprolol.
As above, his anti-hypertensives were d/c'd when his sepsis occured with hypotension.
A CT was negative for PE, EKG negative for ischemic changes.
Recommend video swallow eval in the near future for further evaluation if needed.
