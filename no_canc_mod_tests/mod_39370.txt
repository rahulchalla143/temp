[**2198-2-6**] CT Abdomen: IMPRESSION: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Outside hospital cultures showed MSSA and he was started on nafcillin.
EP was called and he had an EP study with ablation.
He has a CHADS2 score of 2 and so would indicate anticoagulation with coumadin if safe after his repeat EGD in mid-[**Month (only) 958**].
# Retroperitoneal bleed - On [**2-4**], his Hct began to trend down to around 22.
His Hct remained somewhat stable and he received another 2 units on [**2-5**].
His Hct continued to trend down, yet repeat imaging showed a stable RP bleed.
# Suspicion for coronary disease- on [**2-12**] he had some episodes of tachycardia, during which time an EKG showed anterior ST depressions.
The patient underwent an EGD that showed esophagitis, gastritis, and duodenitis, but no active bleeding and no intervention was undertaken.
The patient's Hct was trended and stabilized.
He will require a repeat EGD in 8 weeks (mid-[**Month (only) 958**]) and GI follow-up.
His hypoxia improved with some diuresis.
Chest imaging showed slight pulmonary edema, but no consolidations.
# Acute kidney injury - His basline creatinine was around 0.8.
-- consider resuming coumadin after his repeat EGD in mid-[**Month (only) 958**] -- PFTs should be repeated, with possible sleep study to evaluate for OSA -- Lung nodule seen on imaging that needs to be followed up with repeat CT scan in [**6-26**] months.
