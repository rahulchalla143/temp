She represented to [**Hospital **] hospital with worsening lethargy at which point urine culture showed extended spectrum resistant klebsiella.
Neurology was consulted and an EEG was performed which showed slowing (on prelim read).
CT scans were reportedly stable.

MRI/MRV [**2110-11-19**]: 1.
EEG [**2110-11-20**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal extended routine EEG due to a moderately slow and disorganized background.
CXR [**2110-11-20**]: Borderline cardiomegaly unchanged.
Cerebral angiogram [**2110-11-24**]: FINDINGS: Right common carotid artery arteriogram shows that the right common carotid artery is widely patent with no evidence of stenosis at the bifurcation.
KUB [**2110-11-30**]: There is no free air.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 91562**] was admitted to the neurology service on [**2110-11-18**] after being transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital for further workup of intermittent episodes of somnolence.
Repeat MRI/MRV showed some new areas of signal abnormality in the b/l medial occipital lobes, as well as areas of restricted diffusion in the splenium and R thalamus suggestive of subacute to chronic [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusion.
MRV showed better visualization of the straight sinus as compared with her prior study, but the deep cerebral veins were still unable to be visualized.
EEG showed evidence of diffuse encephalopathy but no epileptiform activity.
Repeat urine culture showed yeast; per ID this was felt to most likely represent colonization.
A second UA and culture were performed at the end of her antibiotic course and was clear.
Her TSH was 14 on admission; it appeared that her levothyroxine had been stopped for unclear reasons.
An angiogram was performed on [**2110-11-26**] to better evaluate her thrombosis and showed clear cerebral venous sinuses with no evidence of thrombosis or occlusion.
Blood pressure began to run high in the 160-180's; she was started on amlodipine 5mg daily in addition to her home atenolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
She will require daily INR checks until therapeutic between [**3-20**].
11. calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO twice a day.
An MRI of your brain showed stable appearance of the bleeding in your brain but also showed slight worsening of the abnormalities in your thalamus on both sides (an area important for staying awake).
You had an angiogram performed on [**2110-11-26**] to take a better look at the blood clot in your cerebral vein.
This showed that the blood clot has dissolved and your vessels are now clear.
We made the following changes to your medications: DECREASED Coumadin to 2mg daily INCREASED Ritalin to 5mg twice a day to help you stay awake STARTED Amlodipine 5mg daily for your blood pressure STARTED Potassium 40meQ daily for supplementation RESTARTED Levothyroxine 100mcg daily for your hypothyroidism  If you experience any of the below listed danger signs, please call your doctor or go to the nearest Emergency Department.
