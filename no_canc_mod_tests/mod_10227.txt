CK was 67.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 91 with normal axis and left bundle branch block with repolarization abnormalities.
She received an urgent EGD the night of [**2142-4-19**] which showed a large, 2 to 3 cm ulcer with clot on the posterior wall of the antrum in the immediate prepyloric region.
On [**2142-4-21**] her hematocrit varied as follows: 27.4, 33.1, 34.9, 36.0, 32.1.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission patient had a temperature of 98.8, blood pressure 168/78, heart rate 88, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 98% in room air.
Cardiac exam revealed regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Chest exam revealed lung fields that were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
Abdominal exam was soft, nondistended, nontender with present bowel sounds.
Extremities were warm, soft with cap refill less than two seconds.
Neuro exam revealed extraocular movements intact.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium 138, potassium 3.4, chloride 108, bicarb 24, BUN 14, creatinine 0.8, glucose 80.
White count 9.5, hematocrit 31.1, platelets 119, hemoglobin 11.2.
PT 13.5, PTT 27.2, INR 1.2.
Calcium 7.7, magnesium 2.2, phosphate 1.6.
Chest x-ray on [**2142-4-20**] showed no CHF and no pneumonia.
EKG NSR at 91, normal axis, LBBB with repolarization abnormalities.
EGD at the outside hospital on [**2142-4-19**] showed no varices, but a clot in the fundus.
Repeat EGD at [**Hospital1 18**] showed a large, 2 to 3 cm ulcer with clot in the posterior wall of the antrum in the immediate prepyloric region.
The lowest hematocrit during the hospital course was found to be 28.5 and the lowest platelet count was found to be 85.
On discharge, [**4-23**], patient's hematocrit was 34.1, hemoglobin 12.0, MCV 88, white blood cell count 13.8, platelets 167.
EKG on [**4-19**] showed an axis at 120 degrees, left bundle branch block, ST depressions in 2, ST depressions in V5, ST elevations in V1 to V2 and left ventricular hypertrophy.
Cardiac enzymes revealed troponin of less than 0.15.
Because of these nonspecific EKG changes, MICU recommended an echo which was performed on [**4-23**] which revealed an EF of 60%.
Echo was performed on [**2142-4-23**] which revealed an EF of 65%.
Hematocrit on admission on [**2142-4-19**] ranged from 28.5 to 32.9.
On [**4-20**] hematocrit ranged from 29.9 to 32.4.
On [**4-21**] hematocrit ranged from 27.4 to 36.0.
On [**4-22**] and [**4-23**] hematocrit varied from 32.1 to 34.1 at discharge.
The lowest platelet count was on [**2142-4-19**] at 85 and rose to 167 on discharge on [**4-23**].
INR on [**2142-4-19**] was 1.3 and decreased to 1.2 on [**2142-4-22**].
TSH was checked and came back within normal limits on [**2142-4-19**] at 3.8.
Routine chest x-ray revealed a pulmonary nodule in the left middle lung field, but there was no evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
Characterization of the lung nodule that appears calcified will be followed up with a CT scan as an outpatient.
BUN and creatinine at discharge were 12 and 0.8.
Given her echo which revealed an EF of greater than 65%, it is likely unnecessary to continue with digoxin.
With respect to her pulmonary nodule, patient was advised to follow up with an outpatient CT scan.
