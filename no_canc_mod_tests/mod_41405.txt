Sensitivity testing performed by Etest.
If confirmation or further delineation are needed clinically, CT or MR could be considered.
[**2149-7-26**] CT Chest:  Right upper lobe nodule on chest radiograph corresponds to a right upper lobe cavitary lesion with slightly spiculated borders.
Pathology: [**2149-7-29**] Sputum Cytology: Rare atypical squamous metaplastic cells; squamous cells, pulmonary macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells and many neutrophils.
[**2149-8-11**] CTA torso IMPRESSION: 1.
Further evaluation with MRI is recommended to evaluate for features of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 year old gentleman with a history of alcohol abuse, HTN and COPD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] after presenting complaining of abdominal pain/distention and found to have a sodium of 104, found to have alcoholic hepatitis and underlying alcoholic cirrhosis.
RUQ U/S showed diffuse nodularity consistent with cirrhosis.
No improvement of INR with IV vitamin K and high AST:platelet ratio, physcial exam findings consistent with long standing cirrhosis.
ADH from [**7-28**] was 3.5 (within nl range), so less likely SIADH.
Sodium was gradually increased on 3% hypertonic saline and fluid restriction.
Patient with sodium 120 when lab draws stopped.
# Secondary peritonitis: Polymicrobial peritoneal infection with E. coli, enterbacter, [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**], possibly iatrogenic, as earlier paracentesis negative for SBP, vs. microperforation.
CT with contrast did not show evidence of perforation, though one CT abdomen showed small amount of free air thought to be consistent with recent paracentesis, and had resolved on subsequent CT abdomen.
Initial plan was to treat with clindamycin for 4 weeks then re-image, with CT guided biopsy when Tbili <6.
Also considered other causes of cavitary lung lesions including klebsiella, staph, fungal, etc, but sputum cultures were unrevealing.
# Hepatorenal syndrome: patient with acute kidney injury late in hospital course, low urine sodium, bland sediment and no response to albumin challenge consistent with hepatorenal syndrome type 1, possibly triggered or exacerbated by restarting of diuretics when he had stabilized from acute infections.
# COPD: Continued on spiriva # Tobacco abuse: nicotine patch  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ====================== Unlikely to affect future management, but of note: - Liver hypodensity on CT not further characterized on MRI with gado as renal function not stable, but AFP and CA [**55**]-9 were normal - Fungal markers, Tb quantiferon pending at discharge, will not need to be follow up as patient transitioned to CMO - Final cultures from peritoneal fluid were pending at time of discharge   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

During this admission you were also found to have very serious lung and abdominal fluid infections, as well as damage to your kidneys.
