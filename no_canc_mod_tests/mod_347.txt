The patient had a previous hospitalization from [**11-2**] through [**11-6**] for which he was scheduled for an attempted apical canalization.
On admission to the hospital, the patient was noted to have a chest x-ray which was significant for a right pleural effusion as well as congestive heart failure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission, the patient was afebrile, his pulse was 56 in normal sinus rhythm, his blood pressure was 107/50, respiratory rate 17, and on room air oxygen saturation was 88%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat unremarkable.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Revealed a white blood cell count of 7,700, hematocrit 34.6, platelet count 195,000.
Sodium 138, BUN of 26, creatinine of 1.0, and blood glucose of 85.
His electrocardiogram on admission to the hospital was normal sinus rhythm with a left anterior fascicular block and a right bundle branch block as well as left ventricular hypertrophy.
His postoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 35-40% which was an improvement from preoperative ventricular function.
The patient had a cardiac index of greater than 3.0 on Levophed and milrinone drip.
The patient had a CT scan of his head which was negative.
His sputum was sent for culture which was found to have Enterobacter and he was started on levofloxacin at that time.
At the time of the reintubation, he was found to have thick tan secretions, although his repeat cultures were negative.
Pulmonary toilet was continued, aggressive diuresis was continued, and tube feeds were resumed.
On [**11-28**], the patient underwent a swallowing evaluation by the Speech Therapy Department.
Since he did not pass his bedside evaluation, it was recommended that he go for a video swallow which showed that he was at risk for aspiration.
He was seen here by the Electrophysiology service and it was decided upon that the patient would be transferred to [**Hospital6 3872**] under the direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**], who would plan to take him for electrophysiology study at [**Hospital6 3873**] and questionable automatic implantable cardioverter - defibrillator placement as indicated.
The patient's most recent laboratory values are from [**2149-12-2**], which revealed a white blood cell count of 10,900, hematocrit of 31.7, and a platelet count of 391,000.

PT 12.3, PTT 31.2.
Temperature is 97.9 F, pulse 58 and normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 106/96, oxygen saturation is 98% on four liters nasal cannula.
The coronary examination is regular rate and rhythm.
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Postoperative confusion, agitation, delirium, question alcoholic encephalopathy.
DISPOSITION:  The patient is being discharged today from [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to [**Hospital6 3874**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**], where he will undergo electrophysiology studies and possibly in the next couple of days be transferred to a rehabilitation facility.
