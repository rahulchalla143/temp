Lung window images demonstrate no pulmonary nodules or parenchymal masses.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A focal hypodensity is noted within the dome of the liver, which is too small to characterize.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is extensive diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
