Initial workup of his aortic stenosis revealed critical disease with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.45cm2, mean gradient 55mmHg, EF 55-60%.
Cardiac cath revealed nonobstructive CAD and patent stent.
He was initially referred for surgical AVR, and 9 weeks ago underwent sternotomy, where epiaortic ultra sound revealed prohibitively calcified aorta and procedure was aborted.
He was then referred to [**Hospital1 2025**] for evaluation for TAVR and was found to have large annulus.
Upon admission he endorsed SOB after walking [**12-11**] mile and climbing 4 stairs, lightheadedness when getting out of bed, and chest pressure when loading the car.

Postoperatively you demonstrated some changes on your EKG [**Location (un) 1131**].
Electrophysiology specialists were consulted, an EP study was done which demonstrated no indication for further intervention.
You will also have an echocardiogram with that visit.
