At baseline, the patient has moderate amount of yellow sputum and is on 2.5 L oxygen via home NC with typical oxygen saturations ranging from 95-96%.
In clinic she had a temperature of 100.3 F, RR 33 and she had notable accessory muscle use and obvious labored breathing.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED her vitals were: Temperature of 101.6F, HR 80, SBP 130s, and oxygen saturations were in the low 90's on 4L NC and remained in low 90s with higher rates on non-rebreather mask.
On EKG she was V-paced as she has a pacemaker.
CXR in ED showed both RUL and LLL opacities.
She has a history of resistant pseudomonas so there was some concern for re-infection, especially since gram negative rods were found on sputum culture.
Urine legionella testing was sent off as well and she was continued on her Levofloxacin coverage at time of her transfer to the general medical floor until urine legionella results returned.
While in the MICU she also underwent daily chest PT and received ongoing nebulizer treatments.
Upon arrival to the general medical floor she had been successfully weaned down to 4-5L on nasal cannula with oxygen saturation levels of 93%-95%.
Despite her CHF history she did not seem to have any signs of fluid overload as her JVD was 5-6cm and she had no crackles on lung exam and no pedal edema.
Because of her bronchiectasis her INR goal is uniquely 2.0 so the team made note of this fact during her stay.

She had an ABG with pO2 63 and pCO2 of 49 in MICU shortly after admission consistent with hypoxic failure mixed with hypercarbia.
At time of her transfer out of the MICU she had been waened to 4-5L on nasal cannula with oxygen saturations in the mid-90s.
At home her baseline oxygen saturations range between 94-97 % on 2.5L nasal cannula per patient and her family.
By time of discharge she was back at her baseline of 2.5 L nasal cannula with oxygen saturations in the high 90s.
# Pneumonia: Despite no leukocytosis, she presented with worsened cough from her baseline, respiratory distress (RR >30), fevers to 101 range, and CXR with consolidations noted at LLL and RUL which were all suggestive of a new PNA.
Given these sensitivity patterns and her significant underlying lung pathology with bronchiectasis she was continued on Levofloxacin initally for coverage for atypicals/Legionalla PNA but once urine legionella returned negative the levofloxacin was discontinued.
Blood cultures all returned negative.
She continued her chest PT and spirometry at the bedside and she was given daily mucinex, nebulizers alongside her antibiotics and her cough and phlegm production gradually improved.
# Systolic CHF: Last EF was 30% in [**2135**].
She remained V-paced with HR in 80s and occasional PVCs with no other notable ectopy.
Coumadin dose was held for a few days due to a brief period of time while her INR was supratherapeutic but it was restarted prior to discharge with instructions for her home services nurses to draw her blood on Wednesday [**10-23**] and have her  INR/PT levels sent to the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic at [**Company 191**] in order to make sure her Coumadin level was within a proper range.
Mrs.[**Known lastname 109589**] INR was 1.9 at time of discharge.
# Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was given a regular cardiac healthy diet and her electrolytes were checked daily and replete on an as-needed basis.
Calcium + Vit D 14.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on Wednesday [**10-23**] and call results to [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital 197**] Clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2173**], report will be forwarded to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

Because of your history congestive heart failure it is important to weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs as this may indicate fluid overload in your body.
