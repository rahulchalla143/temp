CHEST X-RAY ([**2143-1-28**]): The lung volumes are normal.
There is a moderate enlargement of the right pulmonary artery, already documented on a CT examination from [**2142-10-10**] and since then unchanged.
ECHO ([**2143-1-29**]): The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present and appears well-seated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-9-28**], a CoreValve is now in place.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2143-1-29**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, a right internal jugular catheter has been inserted.
Inspiration is improved as compared to the pre-interventional radiograph.
ECHO ([**2143-1-30**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Compared with the post aortic CoreValve implantation study dated [**2143-1-29**], the CoreValve continues to be well seated.
ABDOMINAL X-RAY ([**2143-1-30**]): Supine views of the abdomen demonstrate multiple air-filled loops of small and large bowel.
A single loop of jejunum in the mid-abdomen is slightly dilated due to mild localized ileus.
She underwent TTE which showed successful placement of Corevalve.
#Hepatic cirrhosis: She has cirrhosis by both an abdominal CT scan and MRI with esophageal varices.
#Pulmonary hypertension secondary to hepatopulmonary syndrome: She has apparently responded to sildenafil 60 mg daily with a reduction in her pulmonary pressures from over 100 mmHg systolic to 65 mmHg systolic.
