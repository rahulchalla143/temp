Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 4457**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 45503**] was admitted for stepdown level care on the stroke service for close evaluation and management of left temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
On the second day of admission, an MRI showed this hemorrhage and a left subdural hematoma along the tentorium and falx, as well as overlying the left temporal lobe; on review, the detection of the subdural bleeding was impaired on her initial CT scan due to head motion that significantly limited the study.
Her physical examination remained relatively stable over the hospital course, with notable difficulty in cognition.
Repeat head CT [**2191-7-6**] (~2 days after 1st scan) revealed no further progession of bleeding.
Laboratories studies suggested SIADH (likely associated with the CNS trauma), but the patient also had reduced oral intake prior to admission with a marginal urine output.
Both her sodium steadily improved, and her sodium was wnl at 134 on the day of discharge.
Neurological examination is notable for word-finding difficulties, aphasia (impaired naming), and memory loss.
For rehabiliation facility:  Please adjust anti-hypertensive medications as necessary to reduce systolic blood pressure to 130's-140's over the next two to three weeks.
Thereafter, the goal systolic blood pressure should be 120's and 130's.
As her heart rate is already borderline low, we would not recommend increasing metoprolol or adding another similar [**Doctor Last Name 360**] that slows heart rate.
