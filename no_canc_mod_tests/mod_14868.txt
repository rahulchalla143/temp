MRI/MRA and ECHO were performed (see reports below).

[**2111-12-10**] TSH 1.8  <br> Imaging: ECHO [**7-7**] from d/c summary: "This reveals normal EF of 65%.
The echo is consistent with the presence of a patent foramen ovale."
<br>  HCT [**2111-12-3**] shows subacute infarct of right parieto-temporal region, as well as more chronic infarct.
<br> CTA HEAD/NECK [**2111-12-3**] 1.
MRI/A BRAIN [**2111-12-4**]: MRI Head: Right middle cerebral artery inferior division infarction similar to the appearance on the recent CT examinations.
<br>  CAROTID ANGIOGRAM [**2111-12-5**]: PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room.
Through the sheath, we now advanced [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2 catheter into the aortic arch from where the left vertebral artery, the right internal carotid artery and the right common carotid artery was catheterized and AP lateral filming done.
Three- dimensional imaging was done where indicated.
The left common carotid artery was not catheterized as we felt that this was not necessary as the CT angiogram had supplied us with enough information.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended.
.. [**2111-12-7**]:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The lung bases show mild dependent hypoventilatory change.
Within the limitations of a non- contrast exam, the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, and kidneys are within normal limits.
The intra- abdominal loops of large and small bowel maintain a normal caliber without evidence of obstruction.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
GROIN ULTRASOUND [**12-8**]: FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed only of the right groin vessels.
EKG [**12-10**]: Baseline artifact.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2111-12-4**] sinus bradycardia is no longer present and QRS voltage is more prominent.
He underwent angiography which showed total occlusion of right MCA with some collateral circulation and with stenosis of the basilar artery.
Since [**2111-12-9**], his hct has fallen from 40-->26.6 and he has received 2U prbcs on [**2111-12-8**].
On the evening of [**2111-12-9**], his HR was noted to be 150s and EKG revealed a.fib vs. a. flutter w/ 2:1 conduction.
His SBPs remained stable in the 130s range.
He was then transferred to the ICU for 20 point hct drop from [**12-6**]-->[**12-9**] now with new a. fib with RVR initially difficult to control on the floor.
He had no further signs of bleeding and his blood pressure and hypertension remained under good control.

Echo suggested that atrial clot was less likely than lipomatous hypertrophy.
EKG with rate related ST depressions which improved with decreased rate.
Rate stabilized and rapid a-fib did not recur except briefly on [**2110-12-15**] for several minutes on the floor (responded to IV lopressor 5mg).
TSH was checked and was normal.
Echo [**12-10**] again showed "There is diffuse thickening of the left atrial anterior wall, abutting the posterior aortic root, and extending to the basal portion of the interatrial septum (?
He needs to have his INR checked daily to aim for a level of [**1-3**].
Once again, after several days in the ICU and 2 PRBC packs, hematocrit rose to a tolerable level and remained stable.
Hematocrit remained stable, and vascular surgery felt it was resafe to start low-dose coumadin with NO heparin on [**12-16**].
As above, his infarcts were felt to be embolic, and considering the new diagnosis of afib, coumadin was felt to be strongly indicated.
Does not appear to have been further investigated with echo here.
Echo was repeated [**12-10**] and as above, confirmed possible thrombus.
Blood pressure was stabilized and he was discharged on alternate antihypertensives that were short-acting, and had some rate control properties.
You must have your INR checked DAILY until it is within therapeutic range ([**1-3**]).
