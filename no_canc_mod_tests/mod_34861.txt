Apgars were 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.
She developed respiratory distress shortly after birth and was admitted to the NICU for further evaluation and treatment.
Anthropometric measurements upon admission to the NICU: Weight was 3.385 kg, 75th to 90th percentile.
Length 48 cm, 50th percentile.
Head circumference 34 cm, 50th percentile.
Head circumference 34 cm.
Positive red reflex bilaterally.
Femoral pulses +2.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:  Respiratory: This infant was placed on continuous positive airway pressure shortly after admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
Her chest x-ray was consistent with surfactant deficiency.
Her maximum support required was continuous positive airway pressure of 7 cm of water pressure and up to 100% oxygen.
By day of life 2, she had weaned to continuous positive airway pressure of 5 and oxygen requirement of 25%.
At the time of discharge, she is breathing comfortably in room air with a respiratory rate of 20 to 40 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturations greater than or equal to 96%.
Cardiovascular: This infant has maintained normal heart rates and blood pressures.
At the time of discharge, she has a baseline heart rate of 110 to 140 beats per minute, with a recent blood pressure of 78/44 mmHg.
Mean arterial pressure of 59 mmHg.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Initial serum glucose was 49.
Her weight gain and urine output were decreased on the exclusive breast feeding so the infant is being offered a bottle of expressed breast milk after each breast feeding session.
Weight on the day of discharge is 3.15 kg which is up 15 grams from the weight the previous day.
A white blood cell count and differential were within normal limits.
A blood culture was obtained prior to starting IV ampicillin and gentamycin.
The blood culture was no growth at 48 hours and the antibiotics were discontinued.
Hematocrit at birth was 58.1%.
Hematocrit at discharge is 55.7%.
Peak serum bilirubin occurred on day of life 3 with a total of 15.7 mg/dl.
She was treated with phototherapy for approximately 3 days and the The initial rebound bilirubin was 10.3/0.3.
However, 2 days later the bilirubin was 14.3/0.3 and phototherapy was restarted and provided over another 3 days; the lights were turned off with a bilirubin level of 11.4/0.3 on [**2-21**].
A rebound bilirubin 24 hours off phototherapy today ([**2-22**]) was 12.6/0.3.
With a negative Coombs test and a hematocrit essentially unchanged from birth it is unlikely that the persistently mildly elevated bilirubin levels are hemolytic in origin.
Neurologic:  This infant has maintained a normal neurologic examination during admission and there were no neurologic concerns at the time of discharge.
Sensory: Audiology: Hearing screening was performed with automated auditory brain stem responses.
Psychosocial: [**Hospital1 69**] social work has been involved with this family.
Fax #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 43702**].
Car seat position screening was performed.
State newborn screens were sent on [**2-14**] and [**2198-2-22**].
