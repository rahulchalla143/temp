Video swallow study showed need for honey thickened diet.
History of a. fib, held anti-coagulation, INR at 3.6.

Pertinent Results: STUDIES: CXR [**2133-6-10**]: Cardiomegaly is severe, associated with severe bilateral pulmonary edema, unchanged since the prior chest radiograph from [**2133-6-9**], but progressed since [**2133-6-3**].
ECHO [**2133-6-9**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with inferior akinesis/hypokinesis, and inferolateral and inferoseptal hypopkinesis .
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-1-9**], regional wall motion abnormalities may have been present previously (views subopitmal) but overall left ventricular ejection fraction now appears slightly less vigorous.
SWALLOW STUDY [**2133-6-5**]:  Premature spillover with laryngeal penetration, but no frank aspiration.
Video swallow study performed on [**2133-6-5**], confirmed worsening of patient's ability to tolerate nectar-thickened diet, progressed to honey-thickened with aspiration precautions.
Also he should make a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of his hydrocele and continued Foley catheter.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 25112**] at [**Location (un) **] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: - Aspiration pneumonitis - Vascular dementia - Congestive Heart Failure  Secondary Diagnoses: - Chronic permanent atrial fibrillation - Combined systolic & diastolic heart failure - Presumed coronary artery disease with evidence of old inferior MI - Hypertension - Urinary retention - Hydrocele - Recent urosepsis precipitated by urinary retention   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
These aspirations can increase your risk for pneumonia, however, since you were recently treated for a pneumonia and your exam and bloodwork were not consistent with pneumonia, we thought this diagnosis was unlikely.
However, you had a swallow study in the hospital which revealed that you were indeed continuing to have aspiration events that put you at risk for pneumonia.
