At that time, his left ventricular ejection fraction was 79%.
He had a catheterization in [**2157-6-23**] with a 90% to the obtuse marginal which was angioplastied.
At that time he had an exercise tolerance test during which he walked for 11 minutes with 0.5-mm ST depressions and 70% of maximum heart rate achieved.
At that time, he had a right heart catheterization which showed right atrial pressure of [**12-2**], right ventricle 34/10, pulmonary artery 34/15, and a wedge of 13.
The patient has had no further catheterizations or chest pain since that time until his catheterization during this admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Examination on admission revealed vital signs of temperature 97.5, pulse 75, blood pressure 147/77, respiratory rate 12, satting 95% on 2 liters.
Pulmonary revealed he was clear to auscultation bilaterally/anteriorly.
His groin revealed he had a right introducer in place on the catheterization.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Laboratories on admission included a sodium of 135, potassium 4.6, chloride 102, bicarbonate 20, BUN 19, creatinine 1.4, glucose 153.
His initial creatine kinase was 654 with an MB fraction of 39.
The patient had a white blood cell count of 14.2, hematocrit of 36.9, and platelets of 209.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute with 1-mm ST depressions in V2 through V5, T wave inversions in aVL, T wave elevation in III which was a change from his last electrocardiogram here in [**2158-2-21**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient had a catheterization before being brought to the Coronary Intensive Care Unit.
His catheterization reported left main which was within normal limits.
He had an echocardiogram which showed a normal left systolic function with an ejection fraction of over 50%, and the patient was discharged to home to follow up in cardiac rehabilitation in about three to four weeks.
