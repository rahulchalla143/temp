Course was complicated by Klebsiella HCAP (sp 8d Levofloxacin; BAL on [**6-23**] also showed 2+ budding yeast), [**Last Name (un) **] (Cr 1.1 --> 3.1), E. coli UTI (Dx: [**2168-6-16**]; sp 7d ciprofloxacin) and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**]/glabarta peritonitis (Dx [**2168-6-30**]; sp Micafungin and Flagyl).
Pt was not CT [**Doctor First Name **] candidate as per CT team (TEE on [**6-21**] showed MV vegetation: 2.4x1.4cm and on [**6-30**] showed MV vegetation, measuring 1.3 cm x 0.9 cm).
Exam was notable for being combative and agitated, and [**2-23**] pansystolic murmur best heard over the apex, and slight diffuse abdominal tenderness.
In ED, CT Head was negative, CT spine showed possible C5-6 diskitis (focal endplate irregularities and sclerosis), CXR showed bl hazy opacities, and CTA chest showed lingular nodule and multiple nodularities w fluid overload pattern and NO PE.
Echo [**2168-8-2**] showed a moderate-sized vegetation on the mitral valve (posterior leaflet) and severe (4+) mitral regurgitation.
Csurg was reconsulted for evaluation for mitral valve replacement.
[**2168-7-29**] CT torso IMPRESSION: 1.
These should be followed with repeat CT when the patient's current clinical scenario improves to assure complete resolution.
If patient is postmenopausal then further evaluation is recommended with pelvic ultrasound on a nonurgent basis (within 6 weeks).
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST [**2168-7-22**]: Included views of the lung bases demonstrate small basilar consolidations, mild interstitial edema, moderate emphysema, and multiple scattered ground-glass nodular opacities, all improved since the [**2168-7-18**] chest CT examination.
Relative hypodensity of the blood pool with respect to the intraventricular septum (2:6) is compatible with chronic anemia.
The pancreas, adrenal glands, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are normal.
27) are better appreciated on the contrast-enhanced study from [**2168-6-29**], reflecting infarcts.
ECHO REPORT [**2168-7-19**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior transesophageal study (images reviewed) of [**2168-6-30**], the mitral vegetation now appears smaller.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The maximum gradient through the mitral valve was 15 mmHg with a mean gradient of 5 mmHg at a cardiac output of 6.5 liters/minute.

Patient quickly desaturated to 60s-70s, RR 30s, HR 150s-160s, BPs 150s/90s-100s.
She briefly required ventilatory support with a PEEP of 5cmH2O and pressure support of [**4-26**] cmH2O.
She was instructed to remove her Passey-Muir valve overnight to improve pulmonary hygeine.
On [**7-29**] sputum cx grew colonies of Chryseobacterium and STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPHILIA.
Contributing sources included pneumonia--likely HCAP (sputum culture grew pseudomonas), persistent MSSA mitral endocarditis, possible cervical osteomyelitis/discitis as seen on cervical spine MRI.
In addition, elevated beta glucan raised potential of persistent or recurrent fungal peritonitis; CT was performed, which showed no intra-abdominal or intrapelvic fluid collections.
Given peristant fevers on [**2168-7-29**], a CT torso was performed, which revealed the possibility of another/new infectious lesion in the brain.
For further evaluation, and MRI of the brain was performed and revealed multiple septic emboli with hemorrhagic components.
A repeat echocardiogram was requested by them to evaluate.
This was performed and revealed severe (4+) mitral regurgitation was seen and MVR was done on [**2168-8-12**].
The explanted valve was sent to pathology and had cultures sent.
3) Right external iliac artery thrombus: This was seen on a non contrasted study in the ICU.
There were also some subtle changed on prior imaging from prior hospitalization.
A CT torso on [**2168-7-29**] demonstrated thrombosis of the rt.
ID and Vascular surgery were asked for input as to further specific managment for this finding, if any, over concern for the possible need for anticoagulation given possible nidus of septic thrombophlebitis/ongoing endovascular infection, and recommended heparin drip and would readdress operation after MVR with cardiac surgery.
Serial neuro checks were done while on heparin as pt had septic emboli to brain and had hemmorrhagic components.
Pt required a head CT after starting drip which ruled out hemorrhage.
Heparin drip was discontinued as risk of intracranial hemorrhage outweighed benefit of agressive anticoagulation for clot without interval change and not symptomatic (no wet gangrene of R LE and Doppler pulses of posterior tibialis).
4) C5-C6 chronic osteomyelitis with neck pain: The patient had a head and neck CT that suggested only discitis/osteomyelitis.
7) Hep C: The patient's LFTs and INR remained stable during her admission.
SURGICAL COURSE: 47F seen by Cardiac Surgery on [**2168-6-17**] during an admission for MSSA bacteremia and mitral valve endocarditis with multiple embolic events (brain, spleen, R kidney, [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions), presumably secondary to IV heroin use.
She then defervesced, her blood cultures after [**6-16**] were sterile, and a TEE failed to show progression; thus, surgery was deferred even after she stabilized.
Her hospital course was also significant for Klebsiella pneumonia/respiratory failure requiring trach (treated with levofloxacin x 8d), acute kidney injury (Cr 3.1, presumed secondary to ATN, secondary to hypotension), E.coli UTI (treated with cipro x7d), and fungal peritonitis (treated with micafungin and Flagyl).
In the ED, she was noted to be febrile (102.3), tachycardic (120-140s), and hypoxic (mid-low 90s on 3L).
WBC was normal.
CT and MRI C-spine demonstrated C5-6 chronic osteomyelitis.
CXR and CTA chest demonstrated multifocal pneumonia.
Repeat echo demonstrated that the MV vegetation had decreased in size.
All blood cultures since readmission have been sterile.
CT head demonstrated a new R vertex ring-enhancing lesion, ?early abscess.
[**2168-8-2**] Echo showed moderate-sized vegetation on mitral valve.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2168-8-12**] where the patient underwent MVR (29mm tissue).
Dr.[**Name (NI) 5070**] team, who placed the tube on [**6-23**], asked for a tube study that revealed that the tube was in in good position.
The patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 8**] on POD 6 in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
