Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-12-2**], left ventricular systolic function is similar.
Catheterization was performed, which revealed triple vessel disease, and elevated LVEDP.
Echocardiography demonstrated an EF of 20-25%, with mild pulmonary hypertension.
Potassium levels were monitored closely after the ACE-I was begun.
His oxygen requirement fell and his physical exam improved.
A cardiac cath was recommended which revealed all graft to be patent.
An ICD was subsequently placed.
