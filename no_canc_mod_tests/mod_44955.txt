The patient's blood cultures were positive on [**2164-9-28**] when one out of two blood cultures grew out staphylococcus coagulase-negative organisms.
The patient remained afebrile and subsequent numerous blood cultures thereafter remained negative until the date of discharge on his vancomycin regimen.
The patient was also placed on gentamicin for three days also to help his blood cultures remain negative for the synergistic effect that vancomycin and gentamicin have together.
The patient's white blood cell count and platelets also started to trend downwards and it was thought at this time that the patient's pancytopenia was probably due to vancomycin myelosuppression.
The patient's kidney function continued to deteriorate and by the time of discharge his creatinine had reached a level of 2.8.
The patient was to continue his eight week course of vancomycin at which time he was to have blood cultures drawn.
If these blood cultures remain negative there would be a possibility of liver transplant.
If the blood cultures came back positive, the patient and the family may decide at that time to discontinue any further antibiotic therapies.
