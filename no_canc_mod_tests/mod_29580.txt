EKG [**2170-11-29**]: Ventricular paced rhythm with fused ventricular premature depolarizations in a bigeminal type pattern.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2170-11-29**] ventricular ectopy is new.
CXR (portable AP) [**2170-12-2**]: In comparison with the study of [**12-1**], there is little change in the appearance of the central catheter and pacemaker device.
TTE [**2170-11-30**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-11-18**], overall left ventricular systolic function is more vigorous.
Portable CXR [**2170-11-29**]: A bedside upright radiograph of the chest excludes the right costophrenic angle from the field-of-view.
CT head w/o contrast [**2170-11-29**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses or mass effect.
Hypodensities within the right basal ganglia are consistent with old lacunar infarcts, unchanged.
Vascular leg studies: FINDINGS: Doppler evaluation was performed of both lower extremity arterial systems at rest.
Pulse volume recordings show drop off at the ankle and metatarsal level.

Upon transit to the ED, he was noted to have a low oxygen saturation in the 70s and was placed on non-rebreather and subsequently was placed on BiPAP in the ED.
While in the emergency department, his oxygen sats recovered and supplemental oxygen was titrated down.
# Cardiomyopathy with EF 15%: The patient had repeat TTE on admission that showed EF of 30%.
After aggressive fluid resuscitation, it was felt that he was volume-overloaded.
He had a head CT that showed no acute process.
Urine lytes performed in ED revealed a FeUrea of 26%, consistent with prerenal azotemia.
The patient's creatinine decreased to his recent baseline after fluid resuscitation.
He will need INR monitoring after discharge.
His pacemaker was interrogated and showed no episodes of VT.
Non-invasive arterial studies showed moderate bilateral tibial artery occlusive disease.
