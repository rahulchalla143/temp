Lung windows reveal mild hypoventilatory changes at the lung bases bilaterally.
Although this study is not tailored to evaluate abdominal organs, limited evaluation of the upper abdomen reveals tiny nonobstructing renal calculi, measuring up to 4 mm.
Limited evaluation without evidence for central pulmonary embolism.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
