PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature 96.3, heart rate 89, blood pressure 134/72, oxygen saturation 99% on two liters, weight 200 pounds.
Abdomen was obese, distended to percussion and nontender to palpation.
Neurologic examination was intact.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was 14.7.
Potassium 3.3.
Blood urea nitrogen 33, creatinine 10.9.
Liver function tests were normal.
Digoxin level 0.88.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and initially was believed to rule in for myocardial infarction with a troponin of 5.0.
Maximal CK was 157 with a MG of 13 and a positive MB index of 9.1.
The patient was subsequently taken for cardiac catheterization where coronary angiography of the right dominant circulation revealed branch vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics were measured at baseline and revealed a markedly impaired cardiac output of 3.6 liters per minute and a moderately elevated left ventricular filling pressures with a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 25 mmHg.
At rest, the gradient across the aortic valve was 21 mmHg with a calculated valve area of 0.97 square centimeters.
The patient's systolic blood pressure fell to a level of 70 mmHg.
Aortic valve calculations revealed peak gradient of 34 mmHg and a valve area of 1.02 square centimeters.
For this reason, an intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted with subsequent return of blood pressure to baseline and a cardiac output of 7.1 liters per minute.
The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath improved markedly after the biventricular pacer placement.
He had one episode of systolic blood pressure in the high 70s but otherwise was stable through the remainder of his hospital course.
Gram stain was negative.
