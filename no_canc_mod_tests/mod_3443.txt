[**8-3**] Blood cultures = No growth x2 [**8-2**] Urine culture- GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA.
[**7-29**] EKG - Baseline artifact.
[**7-31**] EKG - Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2148-7-29**] no diagnostic interim change.
[**7-29**] CXR - Comparison made with a radiograph dated [**2146-10-5**].
[**7-30**] Echo - The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
[**2148-8-1**] Cardiac Cath (prelim): 1.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent disease in the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP 16 mmHg and LVEDP 30 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.0 L/min/m2.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2148-8-6**] ectopy is new.
She has remained  afebrile, lung exam non-focal, with only a slight clinical productive cough.
blood, and sputum cultures are pending with no growth to date.
Legionella urine antigen was nagetive.
Acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation- Patient has known history of diastolic CHF with EF of 60% on echo in [**Month (only) **] [**2147**].
On admission, patient's exam was significant for several clinical indices of cardiac failure with blateral crackles on auscultation, elevated JVP and LE edema.
She was given a low salt diet and fluid restricted to 1500 mL, with strict monitoring of her weights and Is/Os.
Echo showed hyperdynamic systolic function w/ EF 75% and severe AS (valve area 0.8 cm2).
She underwent cardiac catheterization which showed moderately severe diastolic dysfunction, clean coronaries and severe AS (valve area 0.61 cm2).
While she was in the CCU, her volume status was carefully monitored and she was initially bolused with small amounts of fluid, at which point her urine output improved.
CXR was concerning for pneumonia.
She was started on empiric coverage with vancomycin and cefepime and blood cultures were sent which ultimately returned negative.
Aortic stenosis- Patient has a known history of severe AS on echo in [**2147-12-12**] with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2 and was admitted from clinic with concern that this has worsened in the 6 months given her decline in functional status and severe shortness of breath.
Echo showed stable to slight worsening of AS w/ valve area of 0.8 cm2, but increased gradient (61 mmHg, previously 44 in [**Month (only) **]).
Cardiac catheterization was performed and showed valve area of 0.61 and mean gradient of 45.4 mmHg.
She under went aortic valvuloplasty with 3 balloon inflations and after the procedure her mean gradient had improved to 24.5 mmHg and her aortic valve was appx 0.88 cm2.
Atrial fibrillation- Patient has a known history of AF, and remained in AF with rate in the 70s to 80s on telemetry for most of her hospitalization.
Her rate crept up into the 90s, and her metoprolol was uptitrated for better control.
CXR was similar to previous.
Had a brief episode on [**8-5**], with no new ECG changes and negative cardiac enzymes and was felt to be non-cardiac and potentially anxiety-related.
LENI study was negative.
CXR was concerning for a possible RLL pneumonia or atelectasis, she was commenced on IV cefepime and vancomycin on [**8-3**] as per the HAP policy.
UA, UCx and legionalla UAg were negative and blood cultures showed no growth.
There was no point tenderness on examination and motion was intact.
