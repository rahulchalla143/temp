His repeat NCHCTs did not show any significant expansion of the hemorrhage or resultant hydrocephalus.
He was eventually started on Lisinopril 40 and HCTZ 25 (he did not respond well to hydralizine NG or amlodipine NG for which he was on high doses).
He eventually was transitioned to a tracheostomy and his respiratory requirements were downgraded to supplemental O2 by trach mask only.
[] Gastrostomy, Pneumoperitoneum - He underwent gastrostomy placement but the next day had abdominal discomfort with a finding of free air under his diaphragm.
There was concern for bowel injury so an exploratory laparotomy was performed.
[] HIV - It was confirmed with his PCP/outpatient ID physician that he does have HIV.
[] Goals of Care and Guardianship - His Code Status was presumed Full.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] was admitted to the neuro-intensive care unit and neurology wards of the [**Hospital1 69**] for the evaluation of a fall and head injury that he sustained following the use of cocaine.
