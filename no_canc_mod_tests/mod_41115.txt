A CT abdomen was performed (no RUQ US) and showed known gallstones without a distended gallbladder or inflammatory changes to suggest acute cholecystitis.
Over the next 24 hours levophed was weaned off and blood cultures returned positive for e coli resulting in the discontinuation of vancomycin.
A CTA Chest was also performed, but did not show evidence of pulmonary embolist.
ECHO was performed and showed a perserved EF by report but no offical read is currently available.
