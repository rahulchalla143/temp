Vital signs: Temperature 97.8, heart rate 81, blood pressure 105/51, weight 90.5, respirations 20.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
The patient had a piggyback orthotopic liver transplant with a Roux-and-Y biliary reconstruction performed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**].
On [**2121-12-10**], after surgery, WBC was 2.4, hematocrit 25.5, platelets 59.
LFTs showed an ALT of 47, AST 1057, alkaline phosphatase 61, total bilirubin 5.4, direct bilirubin 3.6.
BUN and creatinine were 47 and 1.8.
Glucose was 135.
On [**2121-12-12**], the patient had another ultrasound of the liver demonstrating 1) persistent abnormal high- resistance Doppler arterial wave forms, unchanged compared to [**2121-12-11**], that may be related to diffuse edema in the transplanted liver, 2) there is an unchanged small perihepatic, likely postsurgical hematoma.
Prior to the transplant, the patient did have blood cultures obtained on [**2121-12-10**], which demonstrated that there was no growth, and also a swab was obtained on [**2121-12-10**], which demonstrated that the patient had enterococcus sensitive to linezolid.
CVP was 0-2.
Urine output was 10-15 cc/hr.
The ultrasound demonstrated a hematoma in the medial right groin on [**2121-12-12**], and showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
Urine output was slightly improved to 45 cc/hr, platelets to 84.
Hematocrit was stable at 71.
JPs were drainage serosanguineous fluid in large amounts.
On [**2121-12-14**], ALT was 261, AST 77, alkaline phosphatase 90.
Creatinine was up slightly from 2.4 to 2.8. on [**2121-12-14**], the patient was transferred to the floor with no over night events.
Cholangiogram was performed on [**2121-12-15**], as a regular postoperative exam demonstrating that there was biliary drainage, the catheter was at the tip of the jejunum, patent hepaticojejunostomy and anastomosis with reflux of contrast material from the jejunum into the hepatic duct.
On [**2121-12-22**], the patient had an ultrasound of the liver secondary to increased ascites which showed that there was a patent extrahepatic main hepatic artery with improved wave forms, but the enterohepatic arteries could not be found.
On [**2121-12-26**], labs that morning included a WBC of 6.3, hematocrit 24.0, platelets 158, sodium 134, 5.5, 112, 17, BUN and creatinine 54 and 1.7, glucose 104, ALT 20, AST 8, alkaline phosphatase 66, total bilirubin 0.4.
The patient continued to eat well with supplements of Nepro drinks 3 times a day.
The patient is also going to be discharged on MMF 1000 b.i.d., oxycodone 5-10 mg q.6 hours p.r.n., Valcyte 450 q.o.d., fluconazole 400 q.24, tacrolimus 1 mg b.i.d.
The patient should have labs every Monday and Thursday which include CBC, CHEM10, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin and Prograf trough level which the results should be faxed to [**Hospital6 256**] Transplant Office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 697**].
LABORATORY DATA:  On [**2121-12-29**], WBC was 4.5, hematocrit 28.6, platelets 120; sodium 135, 5.7, 112, 18, BUN and creatinine 50 and 2.0; ALT 11, AST 10, alkaline phosphatase 55, total bilirubin 0.4.
