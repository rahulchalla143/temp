CT scan showed right occipital hemorrhage into the ventricle, and pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]  ROS: no headaches prior to today.

MRI with contrast will be helpful to evaluate for possible underlying lesion or vascular malformation  CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2113-2-20**]: 1.

CTA was performed to rule out any vascular anomalies.
Swallow evaluation was performed, and pt was placed on thin liquids with regular solids with strict 1:1 supervision.
CT head demonstrated no significant changes.
Due to episode of hypotension on [**2-25**], an EKG was performed, and pt was ruled out with cardiac enzymes x 3 q 8 hours which was negative.
Repeat head CT on [**3-3**] showed no change.
His ASA 81mg daily was stopped in the setting of his IVH.
Hypertension: His medications were adjusted to keep BP <160 during hospitalization.
Your blood pressure, fever, and sodium levels gradually improved.
You will also obtain a head CT before your appointment.
You will first obtain a head CT on Thursday, [**4-6**] at 11:30 AM at the [**Location (un) 591**] Radiology Office.
