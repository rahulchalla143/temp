An echo done on [**2133-5-8**] revealed preserved LV function with tight AS and a peak gradient of 110 and mean gradient of 80 with an aortic valve area of 0.4 cm2.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count is 7.1, hematocrit 28.8, platelets 206, sodium 130, potassium 4.2, chloride 102, CO2 28, BUN 27, creatinine 1.5, INR 1.1.
In summary, she had a cath that showed critical AS with an aortic valve area of 0.4 cm2, a mean gradient of 76 and normal coronaries.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate is 72, blood pressure 110/50, respiratory rate 16, O2 sat 99 percent on 2 liters.
Respiratory - clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Pulses - femoral on the left is 2+, the right is cath site, dorsalis pedis 1+ bilaterally, radial 2+ bilaterally, carotids with bruits versus radiating murmur bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was accepted for cardiac surgery and was preopped for an AVR on [**5-21**].
The bypass time was 79 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 57 minutes.
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout the night of his surgery and on postoperative day 1, he was weaned from all cardioactive medications, but remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for close hemodynamic monitoring.
At this time, the patient's physical examination is as follows:  Vitals signs - temperature 98.4, heart rate 76, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 150/60, respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 94 percent on room air.
Weight preoperatively was 73.6 kg and at discharge 76.4 kg.
Lab data reveals a white count of 7.2, hematocrit 27.4, platelets 260, sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 97, CO2 29, BUN 19, creatinine 1.1, glucose 128.
Respiratory - clear to auscultation bilaterally.
