EMS was called and her blood glucose was 100.
She was brought to the CT scanner, where at 5:50 p.m. she had a seizure involving left eye deviation and some movement of the left arm (the duration of the event is not described in the records).
The propofol was held during transport so that we could obtain an unsedated examination here.
- EEG in [**2174**] revealed right frontotemporal slowing - MRI in [**2173**] with atrophy and chronic small vessel disease - Seizures began in 50's, has had several hospitalizations, no history of status.
She was initially on Dilantin, then added Neurontin in [**2171**]; then taken off Neurontin and started Keppra in [**2173**]; then admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with 2 breakthrough seizures in the setting of a missed dilantin dose in [**2174**], at which point her Keppra was increased; her last hospitalization = last significant seizure was in [**5-19**], when she was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 882**], and her Keppra dose was increased, as was Dilantin.

[**Name2 (NI) **] daughter does note that her Dilantin level is usually in the high teens, and it was 12.7 today, which might be too low for her.
She was continued on home doses of Keppra, Dilantin and Topamax and levels were followed closely (including Topamax and Keppra were sent out).
Infectious, toxic, metabolic work-up was negative.
CV: Patient had peak troponin 0.14, CPK 191 and MB index 6.2 with normal EKG upon admission which likely represented stress-induced cardiac ischemia/NSTEMI associated with her seizure activity.
LDL was 104 and would likely benefit from starting a statin.
