HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman with a history of congestive heart failure with the last echocardiogram prior to examination revealing an ejection fraction of 75 percent with 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure, atrial fibrillation, and colon carcinoma status post colectomy presenting with congestive heart failure and anemia.
His recent weight is 147 pounds when he is dry, but he was 157 pounds on admission.
Congestive heart failure:  Echocardiogram in [**2159-2-20**] showed mild dilated left atrium with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular function of greater than 75 percent, mild atrial fibrillation, trace aortic insufficiency, and 1+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation along with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.4 to 2.7.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed temperature 95.5, blood pressure 184/94, heart rate 105, respiratory rate 20, 97 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Sclera anicteric, right eye ptotic.
Jugulovenous pressure approximately 10 to 12 cm.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count 3.6, hematocrit 21.6, platelets 108.
Differential 78 lymphocytes, 1 band, 8 leukocytes, 1 monocyte, 12 atypical.
Chemistries, sodium 177, potassium 5.4, chloride 92, bicarbonate 29, BUN 67, creatinine 2.9, glucose 97, creatinine kinase 154, CKMB 14, troponin-T of 0.04.
Chest x-ray:  Stable cardiomegaly, pulmonary and axillary distribution consistent with mild congestive heart failure, without pulmonary edema or effusion.
Initially Foley catheter was placed to monitor ins and outs and creatinine was followed very closely.
His creatinine has remained stable during this time.
Laboratory data revealed an elevated MB index and slightly elevated troponin 0.4 to 0.6.
The patient was monitored on telemetry without _________________during the early parts of admission.
An echocardiogram was repeated to evaluate for new wall defect and provide further ______________ regarding the patient's congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram on [**2160-3-24**] showed in left ventricular function of greater than 55 percent.
On admission, his INR was supertherapeutic at 3.6.
His Coumadin was then restarted with goal INR ranged between 2 and 3.
However, on [**2160-3-25**], he became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 70.
Blood cultures have been negative during admission.
His creatinine was followed closely as he diuresed.
During admission, he did have an increase in creatinine during which time his Lasix was held.
His hematocrit and platelets have been fairly stable within the range since that time.
His hematocrit has been followed closely with a goal transfusion for hematocrit less than or equal to 28.
Rehabilitation - Physical therapy has been working extensively with the patient.
