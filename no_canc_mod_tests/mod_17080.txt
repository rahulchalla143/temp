Electrocardiogram revealed 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads I and aVL with inferior lateral depressions.
A subsequent catheterization revealed 3-vessel disease with no left main disease and no total occlusion, status post Retavase.
The patient was now awaiting Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation for evaluation for possible coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient was sent to the Coronary Care Unit for evaluation of a groin hematoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On evaluation, his examination revealed a temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit orally, his heart rate was in the 60s, his blood pressure was 110/50, his respiratory rate was 16, and his oxygen saturation was 94% on 4 liters.
General examination revealed he was an obese comfortable male and in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal examination revealed the abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended.
He had 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses, and he had 1+ lower extremity pitting edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   His laboratory data on admission revealed his white blood cell count was 12.1, his hematocrit was 40, and his platelets were 237.
Chemistry revealed his sodium was 134, potassium was 4.4, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 1.1, and his blood glucose was 211.
His creatine phosphokinase was 190, MB was 9.3, cardiac index was 5, and troponin at the outside hospital was 1.21.
His coagulations revealed his prothrombin time was 16.3, his partial thromboplastin time was 150, and his INR was 1.8.
His alanine-aminotransferase was 27, aspartate aminotransferase was 140, alkaline phosphatase was 57, and his total bilirubin was 0.5.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed a normal sinus rhythm at 90.
His cardiac catheterization revealed a cardiac index of 2.45, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure mean was 12, his right atrial pressure was 8, his pulmonary artery pressure was 43/12, left ventricular 50/12, right ventricular pressure was 43/11.
His left ventriculography showed no mitral regurgitation, ejection fraction was 35%, with anterior dyskinesis.
His coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system.
He subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 188**] which showed 3-vessel disease and subsequently was referred to Cardiothoracic Surgery for a possible coronary artery bypass graft.
His creatine phosphokinase levels were followed throughout his hospital course and peaked at 1020 on [**12-30**] with his CK/MB also peaking at 120 on this day.
He had his beta blocker titrated as his cardiovascular status allowed for.
Final angiography showed TIMI-III flow in all intervened vessels.
Status post catheterization, he was briefly hypotensive after his sheath was removed which responded to intravenous fluids.
His creatine phosphokinase levels were followed to insure they were trending down by the time of discharge.
He had an initial left ventriculography which showed an ejection fraction of 35%; although no comparison studies were available.
A subsequent echocardiogram on [**1-4**] showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
As mentioned above, he had a brief hypotensive episode after sheath removal following his second cardiac catheterization which responded appropriately with intravenous fluids.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient was initially transferred to the Coronary Care Unit following initial cardiac catheterization showing 3-vessel disease and was found to have a slight right groin hematoma.
It was confirmed on the computed tomography scan on [**1-2**] a right groin hematoma extending into right thigh without evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
His hematocrit subsequently remained stable in the low 30s during the remainder of his hospital course.
Finally, the patient should have an outpatient evaluation of his thyroid function.
The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24298**] in several days for evaluation of his volume status and hypothyroidism.
