This twin #1 emerged vigorous, with Apgars of 8 at one minute and 8 at five minutes.
She received a 48 hour course of antibiotics over first two days of life as part of a sepsis evaluation; blood cultures were negative.
In addition, over the first week of life, there was renal insufficiency noted, with a serum creatinine of 2.3 on ODL #2, increasing to peak of 3.7 on DOL #5.
Urine output was normal throughout.
Renal ultrasound on DOL #3 showed mild left hydronephrosis, mild right pelviectasis, and small bilateral renal cortical cysts.
On physical examination upon readmission to the [**Hospital1 **] neonatal intensive care unit, weight was 1.435 kg.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - Anterior fontanel soft and flat, symmetric facial features, positive red reflex bilaterally.
Chest clear, equal breath sounds, no murmur.
Pulses +2.
Neurologic - Appropriate tone and reflexes, reflective of gestational age.
Recent blood pressure    is 68/36, with a mean of 41.
An ECHO was obtained on [**4-6**]    given the neurologic findings (see below), and that was    normal without evidence of structural disease.
She was noted to have an    elevated alkaline phosphatase, with a level of 752 on DOL #15    and 851 on DOL #25.
Calcium and phosphorous levels were    normal at that time.
At that time, renal    function had improved, with creatinine decreasing to 1.6, and    feedings were changed to breast milk with HMF.
Her most laboratory studies on    [**4-11**] included AP 463, Ca 10.0, Phos 6.2, BUN 25, and    Creatinine 1.2.
Weight on the day of discharge is 2.200 kg.
Periodic monitoring of    renal function and chemistries including calcium, phosphorous,    and alkaline phosphatase is recommended.
HEMATOLOGY: Most recent hematocrit was on [**2132-4-5**] at    34 percent.
The reticulocyte count was 3.5 percent.
Initial head ultrasound on [**3-8**] was    within normal limits.
Follow-up head ultrasound on DOL #32,    [**4-3**], was notable for the unexpected finding of a large    cystic structure in the left parieto-occipital region, with an    additional small right subependymal bleed.
MRI on [**4-3**]    confirmed the large left cystic lesion without evidence of    other injury.
Repeat ultrasounds on [**4-5**] and [**4-9**] were    basically unchanged, with the cyst measuring approximately 2.4    x 1.9 x 1.8 cm, and no change of the right subependymal    hemorrhage.
Head circumferences were followed daily and    remained stable at 30-30.5 cm.
Due to the possibility,    although unlikely, that lesion could have reflected evolution    of an old infarct, ECHO was obtained to assess for possible    right- to-left shunts, and this was normal without evidence of    ASD or VSD.
Head ultrasound has been scheduled for [**4-19**] at    [**Hospital3 1810**] at 11 am, follow-up with the neonatal    neurology program at [**Hospital1 **] has been scheduled for [**4-25**]    at 1pm, and follow- up with Neurosurgery has been scheduled    with the family for [**Month (only) 205**].
Head circumference should be    followed weekly for now as screen for progressive enlargement    of the lesion or development of hydrocephalus.
Audiology - Hearing screening was performed with    automated auditory brainstem responses.
PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Street Address(2) 18787**], [**Location (un) 538**], [**Numeric Identifier 41119**], phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 61175**].
Car seat position screening was performed.
State newborn screens were sent on [**3-5**] and [**2136-3-17**].
A repeat    screen was sent on [**2136-3-28**], with no notification of    abnormal results to date.
A voiding cystourethrogram at [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**4-19**], [**2135**] at 9:30 a.m., with Head ultrasound at 11 a.m. 3.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], renal service, [**Hospital3 1810**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 61177**], four weeks after discharge.
Neonatal Neurology, [**Hospital3 1810**], [**4-25**], 1pm.
Neurosurgery, [**Hospital3 1810**], scheduled with the family    for [**5-30**].
Prematurity at 31 weeks' gestation.
