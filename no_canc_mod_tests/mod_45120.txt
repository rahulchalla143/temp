His Levaquin was discontinued, as the pseudomonas was found to be resistant to it.
He spiked a temperature to 101.2??????
Chest x-ray was done at that time which showed increased left lower lobe consolidation which was consistent with pneumonia and worsened from prior chest x-ray.
It was pathogen directed against Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus and Pseudomonas, all of which showed moderate growth on sputum culture from [**2184-9-21**].
The 1 of 4 positive blood cultures from [**9-22**] was identified as gamma strep.
His hematocrit dropped slightly from 40 on admission to 30 on discharge which was thought to be secondary to dilution with intravenous fluids, especially given patient's hypovolemia on admission.
No source of active bleeding was identified and his hematocrit was stable for the five days prior to discharge.
Due to worsening edema in his right arm just prior to transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, a Doppler study was performed on the right upper extremity which was negative for deep venous thrombosis.
