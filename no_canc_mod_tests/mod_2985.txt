AVR (19mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Pericardial Valve)   History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with aortic stenosis which is a relatively new diagnosis from [**2190**].
Approximately two months ago, she began developing dyspnea and chest pressure with walking upstairs, as well as intermittent mild pedal edema.
A recent echocardiogram revealed severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of <0.8cm2 and a mean gradient of 37mmHg.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The mean gradient across the valve is 8 mmHg at a cardiac output 4.0 L/min.
