Cath lab findings included no coronary artery disease, cardiac index of 2.0 and a LVEDP and wedge of 25.
Additionally echocardiogram showed diastolic dysfunction and biventricular systolic dysfunction.

CARDIOLOGY: Admission echo There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
Echo after extubation The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-2-15**], the aortic regurgitation is new (though prior study only had one color Doppler aortic valve clip, there does not appear to be any AR).
The left ventricular systolic function is better viewed on the current study, but was underestimated on review of the prior study.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD and LCX were without flow limiting disease.
RADIOLOGY: CXR ([**2-15**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Differential considerations include pulmonary edema, multifocal pneumonia, or other etiologies such as pulmonary hemorrhage or ARDS.
CT torso IMPRESSION: 1.
If such history or risk factors exist, consider a one-year followup chest CT to evaluate for stability.
CXR after extubation IMPRESSION: Overall, interval improvement of congestion of congestive heart failure with persistent mild congestion.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] LBBB on EKG (and no prior for comparison), the patient went to the cardiac cath lab, where she was found to have no obstructive lesions but elevated LVEDP/PCWP.
CXR also was suspicious for pneumonia, possibly secondary to aspiration, so she initially received azithromycin and zosyn, narrowed after 1 day to levofloxacin.
# Pump: Initial echo during the cath showed significant cardiac dysfunction with EF of 20%, elevated PCWP.
Repeat study showed EF 55% but new aortic insufficiency not visualized on the first study.
Thus, CT with contrast was done to evaluate for the possibility of aortic dissection.
CT showed no dissection.
However, had a CT to rule out an RP bleed.
Medications on Admission: Vit D 50,000 units weekly Proair HFA Zolpidem 3 mg qhs (obtained from pharmacy [**Telephone/Fax (1) 70172**]) Advair 250/50 Diovan 80mg    Discharge Medications: 1.
Oxycodone 10 mg Tablet Sustained Release 12 hr Sig: One (1) Tablet Sustained Release 12 hr PO Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for pain: long acting pain medication, do not crush or chew; do not combine with alcohol or drive while taking this medication, do not take if sleepy.
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed no heart attack, but some early coronary artery disease.
You will also need pulmonary function tests to better understand your lung condition.
You also need a sleep study to assess if you have sleep apnea, which may have put you at risk for this event.
