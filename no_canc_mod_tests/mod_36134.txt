Abdominal US .
MRI could be performed to furhter assess.
Thrombosis of the right portal vein.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
If indicated, a TEE would better exclude a small valvular vegetation.
Grayscale, color flow and pulse Doppler assessment of the portal venous system was next performed.
Once again there is evidence of aneurysmal dilatation of the splenic/portal vein confluence, with an AP diameter of 5.3 cm.
Today's study demonstrates the right portal vein to be small, but also patent in both the trunk and the anterior and posterior branches, patency confirmed both by color flow and pulse Doppler evaluation.
CXR showed possible opacification in right upper lobe which corroborated with crackles on physical exam.
Abdominal infection and UTI less likely considering normal physical exam and normal UA.
She had urine, blood and sputum cultures sent, including legionell cultures.
She had a central line placed for access and cvp monitoring which was later removed after she was hemodynamically stable.
She was briefly on levophed to support her blood pressure, however this was quickly weaned within 24 hours.
Her osletamivir was stopped when her flu screen was negative.
She did have [**2-19**] blood cultures from [**2-8**] which grew gram positive Cocci which later speciated as strep.
Her legionella antigen was negative.
Her urine culture was negative.
She was narrowed down to Ceftriaxone and recieved a TTE which was negative for valvular vegetations, though she had mitral regurg.
She did have a CT abdomen looking for a source of her original fever which revealed the incidental finding of portal vein thrombus and spleno-portal varix of undtermined age.
AT the time of the discharge ESR 22 and RF 6.
A TEE was not done because of anxiety the patient was experiencing during the admission and the significant sedatives she would require for such a procedure.
Blood cultures pending at the time of discharge .
Held anticoagulation with warfarin as INR therapeutic at 3.0.

After several imaging tests it was determined you will need approximately 3 more weeks of additional antibiotics for this infection.
We decreased your Coumadin to 1mg daily, you will need a INR check in the next week.
