The outside echocardiogram showed anterior hypokinesis and a large left ventricular thrombus.
The hypothermic protocol was initiated and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] where he underwent a cardiac catheterization and left anterior descending artery stent was placed.
He subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization which demonstrated an 80% stenosis of his left main coronary artery and also a 50% mid stenosis of his left anterior descending artery.
His echocardiogram demonstrated mild lesion or left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid and distal anterior septal and inferior septal segments.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
The remaining study is unchanged from prebypass.
