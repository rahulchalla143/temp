EEG [**2178-6-2**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured two pushbutton activations.
MRI head [**2178-6-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2178-6-1**]: Lung volumes are appreciably lower.
CXR [**2178-6-3**]: Patient is rightward shifted which projects the large heart over the right lower lung, but nevertheless, there is clearly progressive opacification of the right lung and decrease in volume of the right hemithorax suggesting a large component of atelectasis, conceivably obscuring pneumonia, but not necessarily.
EEG [**2178-6-4**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Upon arrival here she was intubated and sedated with no further signs of seizure activity.
Initial exam revealed intact brainstem reflexes but was otherwise very limited due to her sedation.
CT showed encephalomalacia of the left hemisphere, and UA was grossly positive.
On exam she was noted to be moving her right side more than left, inconsistent with her prior large L hemispheric stroke.
Routine EEG on [**5-31**] also showed R temporal spikes without clinical correlate.
An MRI was performed on [**6-2**] which showed multiple new strokes in R MCA distribution with hemorrhagic conversion in R basal ganglia.
Vessel imaging and TTE were considered for further work-up but were deferred after discussion with family regarding goals of care when patient was made CMO.
CV: She was maintained on telemetry monitoring during her admission which revealed atrial fibrillation.
Her FSs and ISS were stopped when she was made CMO.
UA was positive upon admission and she was initially started on ceftriaxone for empiric treatment.
CXR subsequently began to show evidence of aspiration pneumonia vs. VAP and her antibiotic coverage was broadened to linezolid/cefepime.
Sputum culture showed GPC in pairs and clusters.
Prophylaxis: She was maintained on SC heparin and a bowel regimen, which were stopped when pt was made CMO.
Her seizures stopped with medication but she was still not waking up appropriately.
An MRI of her brain was then performed which showed multiple strokes in the right side of her brain, in addition to her previous large area of stroke in the left side of her brain.
