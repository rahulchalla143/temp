She required pressors in the ICU to maintain her blood pressure in the normal range and was soon weaned off POD 1.
She was maintained on a heparin drip while bridging to coumadin (her INR was 1.2).
Because of her subtherapeutic INR, she will either need to be 1) placed on Lovenox lifetime without any need for warfarin or 2) Lovenox-Warfarin bridge until her INR is therapeutic.
Her INR should be monitored closely given that this is the second time she has embolized on a subtherapeutic INR.
