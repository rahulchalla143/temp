Catheterization in [**2193**], which showed deferred saphenous vein graft occlusion.
Catheterization in [**2194**] showed an increase filling pressure, inferior hypokinesis, 30% osteal LMA and 80% obtuse marginal occlusion.

Cardiac catheterization was done on [**7-21**], which showed left ejection fraction of 50%, right main occluded, left anterior descending coronary artery occluded, left circumflex occluded, right circumflex occluded, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending coronary artery 95% stenosis.
At that point the patient was urgently referred to CT surgery for further evaluation.
Vital signs were stable.
Postoperative day number one the patient was acidotic in blood gas, which was treated with two ampules of bicarb.
Postoperative day number three the patient's vital signs were stable, occasional bursts of premature atrial contractions.
On the floor the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 130 on the monitor.
The electrocardiogram was obtained, which showed ST depression in V2, V3.
She had a couple of episodes of A tach, A flutter 2 to 1 and atrial fibrillation with rates up to 140.
Postoperative day number six the patient's heart rate is 60 and A-paced.
Occasional episodes of atrial fibrillation with heart rates to 140s.
The patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in three to four weeks for her heart rate issues.
