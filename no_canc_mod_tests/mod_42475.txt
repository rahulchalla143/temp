HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 46 year old female with a history of postpartum dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of about 15% who was recently admitted for congestive heart failure exacerbation.
She presented initially to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] team on [**2122-7-19**], after Visiting Nurses Association noted that her cuff blood pressure was 70/50.
On admission, the patient was noted to have a creatinine elevation from 2.0 to 5.1 with a potassium of 5.5.
An echocardiogram was obtained and showed an unchanged ejection fraction with global left ventricular hypokinesis and akinesis.
The patient went for a right heart catheterization on [**2122-7-21**].
This showed a right atrial pressure of 26, PA pressure of 72/46, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 39.
Postpartum dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%.
Cardiac catheterization from [**2115**] shows normal coronaries.
Chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine of 2.0.
Stress test from [**2121-2-4**] showed mild to moderate reversible inferior wall defect.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.2 F.; pulse 107; blood pressure 96/42; respiratory rate 23; O2 saturation 98% on two liters.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  EKG with sinus tachycardia, left bundle branch block which is old, no changes.
White blood cell count 4.9, hematocrit 28.5, platelets 183, calcium 9.3, magnesium 2.3, phosphorus 6.0.
INR 1.0.
Sodium 133, potassium 5.0, chloride 91, bicarbonate 26, BUN 73, creatinine 5.0.
Glucose 111.
CK 224, MB 2, troponin less than 0.3.
Urinalysis with leukocyte esterase moderate, white blood cells 41, squamous epithelial cells 5.
Urinalysis with sodium 30, urine creatinine 120, urine urea at 215.
Echocardiogram from [**2122-7-20**], ejection fraction less than 15%, severe left ventricular systolic depression with akinetic anterior septum, hypokinesis/akinesis of anterior wall, inferior wall and apex.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 46 year old female with a history of post partum cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of about 15% and diabetes mellitus, who presents after Visiting Nurses Association noticed systolic blood pressure of 70.
She was noted to a have acute on chronic renal failure with a bump in her creatinine from 2.0 to 5.1 in just several days.
The patient was initially felt to be prerenal but noted to have pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 39.
Surprisingly, her cardiac index was higher than expected at 3.28 on 12 of Dobutamine and 3 of Neo-Synephrine.
It was felt that optimally the Dobutamine was more important in maintaining the blood pressure as it would increase the patient's cardiac output, whereas the patient was likely already clamped down from her cardiogenic shock and the addition of too much alpha activity would be deleterious.
Overall, the patient kept her mean arterial pressure between 60 and 70.
On [**2122-7-23**], the patient was noted to be more hypotensive, with mean arterial pressures between 50 and 55.
The patient also spiked a temperature up to 101.0 F.  The patient was pan cultured.
She had also become quite tachycardic up to a rate of 130, in normal sinus rhythm.
After about 24 hours, the patient started growing Gram positive cocci from her blood cultures drawn peripherally and from her left sided arterial line.
Because the patient's cardiac index was higher than expected, her Dobutamine was able to be weaned slightly to 5 micrograms per kilogram per minute.
The patient did receive a renal ultrasound which showed right and left kidney sizes of 9 centimeters.
Once she started diuresing with the Bumex and the Natrecor, her creatinine came down.
By [**2122-7-26**], her creatinine was close to baseline at 2.3.
In addition, the patient's left arterial line was taken out as blood cultures drawn from that line also grew Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient was noted to be anemic with a hematocrit of 28, but stable.
The patient's iron studies are consistent with iron deficiency anemia, although the patient likely also has a low epo state given her chronic renal failure.
