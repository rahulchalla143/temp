#R subclavian clot: The patient was noted to have a DVT of the Right subclavian in [**2179-6-15**] which was likely caused by instrumentation of R.IJ.
Repeat US of the right extremity showed resolution of the clot.
#History of Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis: TFT's were normal during last admission ([**7-1**]) and it was it was determined that it would be safe to restart amiodarone if needed as the risk of AIT is approximately 10%.
