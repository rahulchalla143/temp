She was last admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2145-11-3**] for a fistula placement, which failed and resulted in a small hematoma.
In the ED, initial VS were: HR 150, SBP 60s-70s/40s, nl RR and O2.
EKG was notable for ST depressions, felt to be rate-related vs. demand ischemia per cards after a TTE negative for any new wall motion abnormalities; given ASA PR.
Due to persistent hypoglycemia, she was started on maintenance D5-1/2NS with KCl + D10.
Vitals on transfer: 97.4 (will transfer on Bair Hugger), 100s/80s, RR 18-20, O2 98-100% on 2L  On arrival to the MICU, patient on a Bair hugger and BPs have been consistent in left forearm, quickly weaned off phenylephrine.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
CT head [**11-21**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or infarction.
Areas of hypoattenuation in the corona radiata and periventricular white matter correlate with areas of FLAIR hyperintensity on prior MRI and suggest chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
EEG [**11-22**] IMPRESSION: This EEG gives evidence at the beginning for what would be considered electrographic status epilepticus that seemed to respond positively to the infusion of Ativan and then later to the infusion of phosphenytoin.
The epileptiform activity resolved and the background at the end of the study remained in the mild to moderate encephalopathic range.
The cardiogram rhythm was felt to be secondary to the use of beta blockade that was present prior to the treatment of the status and it, too, seemed to resolve as the evening wore on.
MRA head [**11-22**] IMPRESSION: 1.
EEG [**11-27**] IMPRESSION: This EEG continues to show mild to, at times, moderate encephalopathy without clear focality or laterality.
CXR [**12-1**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-25**]:  Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach, with the proximal end of the weighted tip at or just beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old female with history of ESRD [**1-20**] lithium toxicity on HD with recent AV fistula thromboses and failed placement of right AV fistula, bipolar disorder, likely AF, HTN/HL, CAD s/p LAD stent in [**2142**], L3/L4 discitis on 8-week IV abx therapy, and hypothyroidism s/p thyroidectomy, initially presenting with hypothermia, hypogylcemia, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation with hypotension, consistent with septic shock along with numerous electrolyte abnormalities.
Her hypothermia, tachycardia, altered mental status, and persistent hypoglycemia indicated a septic picture.
Blood and urine cultures were sent and did not grow anything.
A chest xray demonstrated right sided effusions on atelectasis, but were not thought to be infectious.
The patient would complain of odd feelings all over her body, but was unable to verbalize what it felt like and would seem strange or inappropriate.
The patient's CT scan and MRI of her head were both negative.
An EEG was ordered, which showed status epilepticus.
Troponins checked and were actually lower than previous admission.
Her beta-blockade was initially held due to concern for septic shock, but were restarted after went back into AF with RVR.
TSH was checked and normal.
