His initial exam at 1:45am showed full alertness but fluent aphasia with right facial droop but no drift of his arms or legs; he had a R homonymous hemianopia.
Head CT showed a large left-sided ICH.
No nuchal rigidity Lungs CTA bilaterally CV RRR, nl S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abd soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Ext No C/C/E b/l Skin no rashes or lesions noted  NEURO MS Initially awake and alert on arrival -> sleepy after CT scan, needing light noxious stim to arouse.
Speech initially fluent aphasia -> global aphasia after CT scan.
Initially could hold both arms antigravity x 10s and both legs x 5s -> R arm/leg flaccid post-scan, with no withdrawal to noxious stimuli.

NCHCT [**2192-1-13**] at 10:11 am: In comparison with the prior study, again a large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage is visualized as well as the subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the left basal ganglia and left frontal, parietal and temporal lobes.
The orbits, the mastoid air cells and the paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable.
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH [**2192-1-13**]:  An endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned.
Brief Hospital Course: Given the severity of the hemorrhage and the need for intubation for airway protection, the patient was admitted to the neurologic ICU for further evaluation and management.
The patient was given FFP and Vitamin K to reverse his supratherapeutic INR in the setting of hemorrhage; INR dropped from 4.4 on presentation to 1.7 in the am.
Given concern for expanding hemorrhage with shift and herniation, a repeat CT of the head was performed, which revealed evidence of enlargement of the pattern of hemorrhage involving the left basal ganglia; there was also increase in the pattern of vasogenic edema and mass effect with 4 mm of midline shifting to the right.
