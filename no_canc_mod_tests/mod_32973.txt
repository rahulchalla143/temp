[**2125-3-27**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler imaging of the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
[**2125-4-2**] Upper Extremity Ultrasound FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and Doppler imaging was obtained on the right jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, cephalic, and basilic veins.
Blood and sputum cultures were positive for coag+ staph.
CXR showed LUL pneumonia and CT chest showed opacification of the L hemithorax w/o aerated lung.
An ultrasound revealed fluid so a thoracentesis was performed and drained about 700 cc's.
The chest Xray was only minimally improved so the patient was intubated and a bronchoscopy was performed.
Post-operatively the Gentamycin was stopped, and Vancomycin was dosed for a goal level between 15 to 20.
Nutrition was also suboptimal however she was cleared after a swallow evaluation for a modified diet.
The ID service was consulted and will monitor her Vancomycin as an outpatient.
She will also require follow up with the cardiac and plastic surgeons as an outpatient who will monitor her VAC dressing.
