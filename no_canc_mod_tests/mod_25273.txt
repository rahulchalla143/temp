At the OSH, the patient was initially febrile to 102 and her K+ in the ED was 7.6.
Blood cultures subsequently grew GPCs in clusters in [**5-14**] bottles, and a TTE demonstrated a vegetation on her AICD lead.
The decision was made to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for lead extraction.

MICROBIOLOGY Blood and urine cultures: no growth  IMAGING TTE [**6-18**]: .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**6-11**]/201, the tricupsid valve vegetation is not clearly seen (may be because of poor image quality rather than resolution).
Since the previous tracing of [**2164-6-6**] the rate is slower and ectopy is absent.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 72 year old female with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2157**], DM2, SSS s/p PM/ICD placement in [**2163-6-11**] and dilated cardiomyopathy who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**6-3**] with fever and lethargy, found to have vegetations on AICD leads, Mitral valve and Tricuspid valvee and Enterococcal sepsis, was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] [**6-5**] where ICD leads were extracted and IV antibiotics were initiated for endocarditis.
enterococcal endocarditis with ICD lead + MV + TV vegetations:  Patient presented to OSH with fevers to 102 and lethargy,Blood cultures revealed entercocci in [**9-17**] bottles as well as in her urine culture.
TTE showed vegetations involving the AICD leads, likely [**3-14**] enterococci urosepsis.
Daily surveillance blood cultures were all negative and her repeat urine culture was negative as well.
Her renal function was monitored closely during this time and worsening renal function prompted change from gentamycin to ceftriaxone.
CXR was without focal infiltrate.
Most recent TTE on [**6-18**] showed mild-mod MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**] mitral valve vegetation, vegetation was no longer seen on the tricuspid valve but this may be because of poor image quality rather than resolution.
There was moderate TR and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and RV dilatation which were improved from [**6-11**] study.
CXR consistent with pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.
Repeat TTE with worsening valvular function, Moderate to severe [3+] TR.
Weight at time of discharge is 65.7, she appears clinically euvolemic.
EF at time of discharge is 40%.
OUTPATIENT Follow-up plan: -- Monitor weights daily, I/O and diurese as needed to maintain clinical euvolemia.
RHYTHM: The patient has a history of sick sinus syndrome, prompting the original placement EP study in [**2163**] which showed inducible polymorphic VT.  AICD was placed for primary prevention in the setting of depressed LV function (EF = 25-30%).
Out patient follow up plan - continue telemetry monitoring - follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2164-8-1**] at 1:40 PM  #.
Microscopy of the urine showed rare muddy-brown cast.Patient was also on gentamycin at the time, levels were theraputic but as contribution of gentamycin to ATN could not be ruled out this was switched to ceftriaxone.
Elevated INR: Patient was not on anticoagulation on admission, but her INR was 3.0.
LFTs and DIC labs were unremarkable.
INR remained stable throughout remainder of her stay.
Normocytic anemia: Hct was stable, without signs of active bleeding.
HCT did note to trend down on [**4-3**].
HCT stable prior to transfer 28.6  #.
Glucose at OSH trended in 200s-300s in the setting of infection, with initiation of Lantus to 40 (from 20) units nightly.
Calcium+D 500 mg(1,250mg) -200 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush PICC, non-heparin dependent: Flush with 10 mL Normal Saline daily and PRN per lumen.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check chem-7 and CBC tomorrow [**2164-6-23**] 18. insulin glargine 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: Thirty (30) units Subcutaneous at bedtime.
Your blood pressure is now stable and your kidney function is improving.
You will need an echocardiogram again after the antibiotics are finished on [**7-17**].
