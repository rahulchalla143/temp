Once in the ED the patient triggered for SBP 80, rapid afib in 110 and his blood pressure improved with 500cc NS.
CTA torso showed diffuse PE.
Past Medical History: epidural hematoma (C2-C4) [**10/2184**]: while INR was 3.1, coumadin stopped PE: large PE in 7/[**2183**].

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-6-8**], the pulomonary artery pressure and tricuspid regurgitation are significantly worse.

No evidence of right heart strain on EKG, but on ECHO there was elevation in right heart pressures and RV dilatation, in addition to significantly worsened TR.
A limited hypercoagulable work-up was initiated, and was significant for a mildly positive Beta 2 microglobulin and a high [**Doctor First Name **] titer.
An MRI of C spine from [**11-30**] indicated resolution of prior epidural hematoma.
