Troponin T was 0.02-0.04 with no STE noted while in NSR.
She was then referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of this presumed ventricular tachycaria and surgical intervention on her aortic valve.
Before transfer, she had a coronary catheterization which was reportedly clean.
In both instances patient describes an aura of "warmth" over her chest and head that happens from an emotional stimulus (receiving an upsetting phone call).
Patient elected to leave [**State 1727**] and come home where she was worked up with a surface echocardiogram at [**Location (un) 47**].
During the procedure, BP fell from systolic 120 to 100 which was maintained for 30 minutes.
Echo was done immediately after procedure (ICE) showing developing effusion.
Another echo done 45 minutes apart showed marginal growth.
DR.[**Doctor Last Name **] recommended tap due to involution of RV (tamponade physiology).
NECK: Supple with JVP of 8 cm.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: Echocardiogram [**2187-8-9**]: LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.
LV EF > 55%, no segmental wall motion abnormalities.
Carotid Duplex [**2187-8-9**]:Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 60/27, 103/47, 98/38 cm/sec.
CCA peak systolic velocity is 95 cm/sec.
ECA peak systolic velocity is  57 cm/sec.
On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 63/16, 77/39, 60/25 cm/sec.
CCA peak systolic velocity is 100 cm/sec.
ECA peak systolic velocity is 55 cm/sec.
Pt transferred to CCU for close monitoring in setting of RV perforation and pericardial effusion.
There was only 70 cc of fluid drainage overnight and repeat echo did not show re accumulation of fluid.
Cardiac Surgery Course The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2187-8-9**] where the patient underwent Aortic Valve Replacement([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] 25 mm Porcine).
She had no further ectopy and her beta-blockers were titrated as needed.
Electrolytes were replete to maintain potassium greater than 4.0 and Magnesium greater than 2.
