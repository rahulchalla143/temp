She developed temperatures with a temperature maximum of 102.0 F. with increasing left thigh erythema, swelling and tenderness.
Ultrasound was done which was negative for fluid collection.
A repeat ultrasound was done on the 8th which showed a pseudo-aneurysm, query graft infection.
History of creatinine renal insufficiency with a baseline     creatinine of 2.0.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 98.6 F.; 72; 193/55; 28; O2 saturation on room air is 99%.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination is unremarkable.
Musculoskeletal examination shows a left inner thigh erythema, swelling and redness.
Neurological examination was unremarkable.
LABORATORY:  In the Emergency Room included white count of 1.4, hematocrit 31.2, platelets 47,000.
Electrolytes: Sodium 132, potassium 3.2, chloride 100, CO2 29.1, BUN 44, creatinine 2.8.
INR and PTT were normal.
Chest x-ray showed a cardiomegaly with upper zone re-distribution.
Ultrasound of the thigh was negative for deep venous thrombosis and echocardiogram was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of 60% with two to three plus mitral regurgitation.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a normal spleen.
The patient was then admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.
Her routine labs were monitored.
She had bilateral vein mapping, upper and lower extremities, completed and an ultrasound, arterial, done on the thigh.
The patient was placed on neutropenic precautions secondary to her low white count of 1.4.
The Hematology/Oncology consultation recommended beginning Epogen of 30,000 units and continue weekly until hematocrit is 30 or greater; start Neupogen 300 mcg subcutaneously q. day and skip if white count is greater than 10,000, restart folic acid 1 mg q. day; transfuse for hematocrit to be maintained between 28 and 30.
Renal also was requested to see the patient and recommended to dose all medications for a creatinine clearance of 15 to 25.
Her extremity examination showed dressings were clean, dry and intact with a palpable graft pulse and a warm foot.
Antibiotics were continued and cultures were monitored and choice narrowed according to culture results.
She did have a temperature elevation of 101.7 F., that defervesced to 100.7 F.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.
The white blood cell count was 1.4.
Incentive spirometry and chest PT was begun.
A chest x-ray was obtained without evidence of focal consolidation.
During the postoperative period, the patient had acceleration of her renal dysfunction with a peak creatinine of 3.4 post-fever.
There was continued improvement in her creatinine to show a fall from 3.4 to 2.7 over the next 48 hours after beginning treatment for the urinary tract infection.
On postoperative day her blood pressure remained elevated and required adjustments in her Norvasc and was converted to Cardura.
for systolic blood     pressure greater than 180.
