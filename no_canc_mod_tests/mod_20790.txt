There, he had a CT scan of the head which showed evidence of a left frontal contusion as well as C1 and C2 fractures.
Vital signs revealed heart rate was 80, blood pressure was 124/72, respiratory rate was 24, and 100 percent on mechanical ventilation.
Neck examination demonstrated a midline trachea.
The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with no obvious injury.
Cardiovascular examination revealed irregularly bradycardic.
Rectal examination demonstrated decreased rectal tone and was guaiac negative.
No repeat imaging was obtained initially, secondary to the fact that he came with hard copies of all of his radiologic studies at [**Hospital6 2561**].
Further imaging in order to determine his prognosis was then obtained.
A CT scan of the head demonstrated no obvious intracranial bleed, but a fracture of the clivus, arch of C1 and dens.
A CT angiogram of the chest demonstrated no PE and no dissection with bibasilar atelectasis.
An echocardiogram demonstrated a normal ejection fraction of greater than 55 percent without hypokinesis and normal valvular function.
A CT angiogram of the neck demonstrated obstruction of the right vertebral artery and narrowing of the left vertebral artery.
