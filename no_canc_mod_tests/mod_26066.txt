History of Present Illness: 74-year-old female with history of severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.75 cm2, peak/mean gradients 75/50 mmHg), who presented with substernal chest pain and EKG changes.
Underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy on [**2163-4-11**] and cholecystectomy was deferred given her AS.
She presented again to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2163-4-21**] with abdominal pain and a CT abdomen showed gallbladder inflammation suggestive of acute cholecystitis.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
EKG showed 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in I, II, aVL, V4-V6 with troponin elevation.
On [**4-23**] a perc cholecystostomy tube was placed given her high risks for surgery and her WBC improved, has been afebrile and abdominal pain improving, although her troponins continued to rise up to 2.5 this am.
A cardiac surgery consult was requested for evaluation of possible CABG and AVR.
Has had cognitive decline since her husband died 3 [**Name2 (NI) 1686**] ago.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
LAA ejection velocity is <40cm/s.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %).
The left ventricular systolic function remains mildly depressed, estimated EF is 40-50%.
The right ventricular systolic function remains unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo W with AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7cm2), PE ([**12-18**]), s/p Left CEA (09) and recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for gall stone pancreatitis and GIB ([**4-14**]) who presented to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital with RUQ pain, diagnosed with cholecystitis, but also developed CP/CHF and a troponin bump, transferred [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for treatment of cholecystitis w/ drainage and management of NSTEMI.
Repeat TTE showed [**Location (un) 109**] at 0.7-1.0.
She  underwent Cardiac Catheterization that showed two vessel coronary artery disease, Severe aortic stenosis, and preserved ventricular function.
Preoperative workup was performed per cardiac surgery protocol.
She transferred to the step down unit on POD#2 for further monitoring and recovery.
Physical Therpay was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
