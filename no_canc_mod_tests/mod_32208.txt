Admission Date:  [**2186-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-10-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization with two bare metal stents to Right Coronary Artery   History of Present Illness: 87 yo female with history of dementia presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2186-10-8**] with chest pain and diaphoresis, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for immediate cath as thought to have an inferior STEMI, with ST elevations and CKs ranging from 150-155.
She was hypoxic and hypotensive with a PCWP of 20-25 in the catheterization lab and was admitted to the CCU post-operatively for additional management.
Of note, she had a leukocytosis to 33 with 92% neutrophils, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and an elevated LDH in addition to her cardiac issues.
Infectious work up revealed negative blood and urine cultures, and a CT torso significant for multi-focal ground glass opacities consistent with edema vs. a multi-lobar infectious process, and one enlarged 17x17mm subcarinal lymph node was found as well.
The patient had no chest pain, dizziness or shortness of breath compliants at that time and her blood pressures were stable.
A more detailed EP study with possible ablation was also explored but the patient continued to have bradycardia, hemodynamic instability and an acute PNA infection.
She was continued on metoprolol 50mg twice a day and her electrolyes were closely monitored and repleted while on the cardiology service.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**2186-10-18**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 14mm Hg.
There was mild to moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 45/19 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressure was elevated at 210/80 mm Hg prior to administration of NTG drip IV.
The cardiac index was depressed at 1.8 L/min/m2.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
Perihepatic ascites and periportal edema, could be due to underlying CHF.

She was noted to have a leukocytosis to 33 with 92% neutrophils, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and an elevated LDH in addition to her cardiac problems.
A CT of her torso was significant for multi-focal ground glass opacities consistent with edema vs. a multi-lobar infectious process and one enlarged 17x17mm subcarinal lymph node was described as well.
She triggered for bradycardia to the 30-40 range and appeared diaphoretic and pale with systolic blood pressures ranging from 70-90 range which was a marked dip from her baseline 120-130 systolic ranges.
An EKG revealed a prolonged QTc to 580 with sinus bradycardia.
The team stopped quinidine, azithromycin, and metoprolol and gave a one-time dose of atropine and IV magnesium.
Soon after quinidine was discontinued the patient's VT eventually stabilized and her electrolytes were closely monitored.
The patient's low Hct levels were felt to be due to her chronic anemia.
An anemia workup was consistent with anemia of chronic disease with mixed Fe-deficiency.
Repeat CXRs showed bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with possible aspiration and a small consolidation was noted at the patitn's left upper lung lobe.
Mrs.[**Known lastname 80177**] WBC trended down initially.
Ground glass opacities seen at bases on Chest CT seem more likely due to volume overload than infectious infiltrate.
Blood/Urine Cultures were unremarkable.
WBC was followed closely and there was a small concern for occult malignancy.
A speech and swallow evaluation was done and it was felt that the patient was not a major aspiration risk.
On [**2186-10-19**] the patient began to display worsening shortness of breath and a new development of fluid overload alongside declining oxygen saturation levels.
CXRs showed bilateral effusions and physical exam revealed bilateral crackles at the mid-lower lung fields.
The patient lost her peripheral IV access on [**2186-10-21**] and the patient as well as her family expressed that she did not want any more needle sticks for blood draws and the patient did not want any additional IVs.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**1-18**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day) as needed.
