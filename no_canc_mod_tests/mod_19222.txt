Diffuse gallbladder wall edema, similar to the CT from [**2194-9-19**].
Sigmoid colon biopsy ([**10-1**]): DIAGNOSIS: Colon, sigmoid, mucosal biopsy: No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Her INR was elevated, so she was given vitamin K. On the gancyclovir treatment, the patient's liver enzymes steadily improved, however, they started to rise towards the end of her admission.
There was concern that her diarrhea was related to CMV colitis, however a simoidoscopy with biopsy showed no concerning infection.
A pathology consult thought a transfusion reaction was unlikely saying "although the patient experienced oxygen desaturation, had a low arterial PO2, and developed crackles at the time of the transfusion, it is difficult to separate these from the findings from the symptoms she is experiencing due to her underlying condition.
The lack of diffuse infiltrates on CXR and the lack of hypotension temporally associated with the transfusion make transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) unlikely.
Upon transfer to the medical floors, the patient had a stable hematocrit without signs of bleeding.
An MRV of the head ruled out sinus thrombosis and a head CT was normal.
