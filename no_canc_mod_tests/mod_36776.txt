Iatrogenic bile duct injury - Underwent interval laparoscopic, converted to open cholecystectomy on [**4-3**]; Complicated by iatrogenic CBD injury - Intra-op critical view was felt to be achieved; intra-op cholangiogram did not reveal CBD injury - Converted to open due to adherrent bowel to RUQ - POD1: LFT, Bil noted to be raised + raised Trop T; went into AF with RVR; cardio consult recommended doubling Toprol dose - MRCP done in view of rising Bil: non-filling CBD ; PTC placed; initally drained bile but now blood - Transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac evaluation and management of CBD injury  2.
CAD - No acute intervention for NSTEMI, left circumflex stenting in [**1-21**] - Cardiac cath [**2-18**] shoed thrombosed left circumflex stent, unable to recannulate - Noted to have stress-induced AFib and demand ischemia but did not require further investigation  Past Medical History: PMHX 1.
CAD s/p left circumflex stenting with recent myocardial infarction [**1-21**] - Cardiac cath [**2-18**] showed thrombosed left circumflex which cannot be recannulated  2.

Imaging: - [**3-28**] CXR ([**Last Name (un) 1724**]): The chest is normal except for healed rib fractures on the right.
There is no interval change - [**4-3**] Intra-Op Cholangiogram ([**Last Name (un) 1724**]): Opacification of the intrahepatic biliary ductal system, probably both right and left intrahepatic ducts, as well as dilation of a tubular structure more inferiorly that was initially read as the common bile duct.
Further review indicates that in addition to the common bile duct, this also could be a dilated left intrahepatic duct projecting inferiorly due to obliquity - [**4-4**] MRCP ([**Last Name (un) 1724**]): Common hepatic duct and proximal CBD not seen and there is dilatation of the left greater than right intrahepatic biliary ductal system, with postsurgical inflammatory changes within the operative bed as well as perihepatic fluid.
An occulsion cholangiogram did not result in passage of contrast beyond the cut-off.
Brief Hospital Course: 75M with a recent hx of cholecystitis and cholangitis ([**1-/2152**]), managed medically due to concurrent NSTEMI w/trop >84 underwent an interval laparoscopic converted to open cholecystectomy on [**4-3**], which was complicated by an iatrogenic CBD transection and cardiac enzyme elevation.
The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac evaluation and management of his bile duct injury.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled which revealed no rising troponin levels.
On [**4-9**] the patient underwent preoperative evaluation.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
The patient's wound was monitored for possible signs of infection.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely.
On [**2152-4-14**] a repeat tube cholangiogram was obtained which demonstrated patent anastamosis.
Medications on Admission: Medications prior to admission to [**Last Name (un) 1724**]: coumadin 5mg daily, ASA 325mg daily, finasteride 5mg daily, terazosin 2mg daily, Toprol 12.5mg daily, omeprazole 20mg daily, lovastatin 20mg qAM / 40mg qPM, asthmacort, albuterol, MVI, Vit D .
Medications on transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]: Toprol XL 25mg daily, omeprazole 20mg daily, albuterol 2puffs q6h PRN SOB, lorazepam 0.5mg IV BID, ASA 325mg daily, HSQ 5000U TID .
Discharge Instructions: Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] if you have any of the following: fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, increased abdominal pain or distension, constipation/diarrhea, incision redness/bleeding/drainage or capped "roux tube" insertion site appears red or has drainage.
