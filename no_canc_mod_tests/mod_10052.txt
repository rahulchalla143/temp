She was taken to [**Hospital3 42966**] where her sodium was 115, potassium 2.5 and a head CT revealed an subacute subdural hematoma.
LABS ON PRESENTATION:  She had a white blood cell count of 17.1, hematocrit of 30.4, platelet count of 265.
Sodium of 115, potassium 2.9, chloride 78, bicarbonate 23, BUN 24, creatinine 1.0 and glucose 133.
The patient's cardiac panel showed a troponin of less than 0.3, CPK of 666 and a CK/MB of 15.5.
A urinalysis was done which was yellow and cloudy with protein greater than 300, large blood, trace ketones, small bilirubin, pH of 5, specific gravity of greater than 1.030, large leukocytes, negative nitrite and greater than 50 white blood cells and red blood cells.
The patient's electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with decreased ST segments in V5 and V6.
The patient also had reports from [**Hospital3 3765**] of a head CT of 1.2 cm x 6.5 cm of right post frontal subdural without midline shift.
Chest x-ray also by report from [**Hospital3 3765**] showed an obscured right heart border and a cervical spine by report from [**Hospital3 42966**] showed no fracture or dislocation.
During her Medical Intensive Care Unit course, the patient's repeat head CT showed subdural hematoma which was unchanged to slightly smaller.
The patient was felt to have hypovolemic hyponatremia and was started on normal saline infusion with improvement of her sodium from 115 to 120, as well as improvement of her mental status.
A second panel of cardiac enzymes were sent which were again negative.
She was then sent again for a repeat CT scan which showed no change in her subdural hematoma and the patient denied any further chest discomfort from then on.
The patient was treated for her hyponatremia with fluid restriction, thought likely to be SIADH given her subdural hematoma.
Her sodium continued to increase through her hospital course.
The patient had an echocardiogram which was completed on [**2112-7-11**] which shows severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild dilated left atrium, hyperdynamic left ventricle with an ejection fraction of greater than 75%, aortic valve leaflets severely thickened and deformed, moderate aortic stenosis, mild mitral stenosis, 1+ to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation according to telemetry and repeat electrocardiogram with slight decrease in the level of ST depression from the baseline electrocardiogram.
The repeat urine cultures showed no growth which indicated that there was adequate coverage with the antibiotic chosen.
The patient's electrolytes were monitored on a daily basis and repleted as necessary, especially in regards to her potassium phosphorus and magnesium.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Her right pupil was reactive, the left surgical.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema and distal pulses are palpable 2+.
DISCHARGE LABS:  Her white blood cell count is 11.8.
Hematocrit is 35.8.
Platelet count is 266.
Her sodium is 132, potassium 4.3, chloride 94, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, glucose 123.
Calcium is 8.9, potassium 3.2, magnesium 1.9.
