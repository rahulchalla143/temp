When EMS arrived, the patient was noted to have a room air oxygen saturation in the 60% range and she was noted to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate in the 40s.
Upon arrival in the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be cyanotic and her vital signs showed a heart rate of 85, blood pressure 175/77, respiratory rate 32, and she was saturating at 97% on 100% nonrebreather face mask.
This was diagnosed at least five years prior to the time of admission when sleep studies performed in [**2098-2-17**], showed 43 hypopneas and oxygen saturation in the 70s.
The patient had room air oximetry studies performed in [**2102-7-21**], again at an outpatient hospital which showed that she spent approximately 63% of her time with oxygen saturation in the 90s, 24% of her time with oxygen saturation in the 80s and 5% of her time with oxygen saturation in the 70s.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery catheterization in [**2097-10-18**], which showed clean coronary arteries.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  When we examined the patient, her vital signs revealed a heart rate of 48, blood pressure 89/48, respiratory rate 26, oxygen saturation 92% on BIPAP face mask with a pressure support of 15, PEEP of 5 and FIO2 of 40%.
Her skin examination was notable for pallor but no cyanosis.
Examination of the jugular venous distention revealed jugular venous pulse of 9.0 centimeters.
Her chest examination showed diffusely decreased breath sounds, decreased more so on the left side than on the right side, however, there were no wheezes or crackles noted.
Her cardiac examination revealed a bradycardic heart rate but at a regular rhythm with a harsh IV/VI systolic murmur heard across the precordium, an occasional S3 but no rubs.
Her abdominal examination revealed normoactive bowel sounds, obese but soft abdomen, which was nontender.
Examination of her extremities showed dorsalis pedis pulses 1+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, sodium 142, initial potassium of 7.0 in a hemolyzed specimen with a repeat potassium of 4.9, chloride 96, bicarbonate 37, blood urea nitrogen 23, creatinine 0.8, and glucose of 151.
Her complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 6.9, hematocrit 37.5, and platelet count of 357,000.
The white blood cell count differential included 72% polys, 20 lymphocytes and 7 monocytes.
Her coagulation panel showed a prothrombin time of 13.0, partial thromboplastin time of 29.1 and INR of 1.2.
Initial CK level was 65.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 beats per minute with some right axis deviation and right bundle branch block which was unchanged from previous electrocardiogram provided from outside hospital.
A chest x-ray showed opacification at the right mediastinal border and prominent pulmonary vasculature but no focal consolidation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, an initial arterial blood gas was performed with the patient on 100% nonrebreather face mask.
This blood gas revealed a pH 7.19, pCO2 122, and pO2 of 150.
After the patient was placed on a face mask with 50% FIO2, a repeat blood gas showed a pH of 7.13, pCO2 of 137, and pO2 of 132.
Instead, full face mask was the preferred method of oxygen delivery and she was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilatory status.
On the evening of admission, ultrasound studies of the lower extremities were performed and revealed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
Further antibiotics were held at this time as the patient was afebrile and did not have an elevated white blood cell count and there was low clinical suspicion for pneumonia.
Overnight, the patient's oxygenation and ventilatory status improved somewhat based on repeat arterial blood gas analysis.
On [**2103-7-25**], hospital day two, an echocardiogram was obtained in order to assess the possible role of diastolic congestive heart failure contributing to pulmonary edema and the patient's shortness of breath.
Following the echocardiogram which was performed at the bedside, the patient experienced a desaturation with oxygen saturation noted to be in the 30 to 40% range.
An electrocardiogram was obtained and showed no changes suggestive of acute ischemia.
Stat portable chest x-ray also showed no acute change from prior chest x-rays.
At the time of this desaturation event, the patient was on nasal CPAP and ultimately after being placed on full face mask BIPAP, the patient's oxygen saturation returned to the 80% range.
The echocardiogram ultimately showed an ejection fraction greater than 55%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Although previously obtained lower extremity ultrasounds had revealed no deep vein thrombosis, we continued to entertain the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
Therefore, we had been unable to send the patient for a CT angiogram study to prove the presence of pulmonary embolism.
This same day an initial blood culture taken in the Emergency Department returned positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters in one out of two bottles and the patient was begun on Vancomycin.
On the morning of [**2103-7-26**], the patient was restarted on Solu-Medrol to treat for any possible underlying component of bronchospastic disease and the decision was made to obtain a bedside abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the question of a pleural effusion at the right lung base seen on serial chest x-rays.
