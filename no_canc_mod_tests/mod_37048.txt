CXR ([**9-23**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
MRI of the orbits was unable to be completed secondary to the patient's claustrophobia.
Head CT showed no evidence of intracranial mass or hemorrhage.
LP showed opening pressure of 8, elevated WBC, increased protein, decreased glucose.
CSF showed no bacteria, no virus isolated so far, no fungus, and no cryptococcal antigen.
The CSF was negative for HSV 1 and 2 but positive for EBV.
CSF VDRL and Treponema antibody were pending at the time of discharge.

The patient was transferred to the MICU for PCN desensitization protocol, with 7 doses of increasing penicillin over 3 hours.
If patient's PCN doses are separated by greater than 12 hours, he will need repeat desensitization.
They recommended for him to continue Pred Forte 1 gtt Q1hr OU and Scopolamine 0.25% 1 gtt [**Hospital1 **] OU, which had been prescribed to him a few months earlier.
# HIV: The patient was diagnosed with HIV in [**2118**] [last CD4 ([**1-1**]) 81, VL 48].
The patient had a CD4 count of 80 and CD4% of 13, and his HIV Viral load was 1,390 copies/ml.
A CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
#Hyponatremia:  The patient presented with a Na of 134, which decreased to 131 on Day 2 of admission.
Serum Osm 272, Urine Osm 308, Urine urea 407, UrineCr 48, UrineNa 43.
The patient had guaiac negative stools, iron studies normal, normal reticulocyte count, and normal B12 and folate levels.
His Hct improved to 33.7 at the time of discharge, and his anemia was possibly due to hemodilution from SIADH.
