CXR suggested PNA so she was given Vanc/Levo.
During the exam patient becoming more confused and BP dropped to 80s/30s remained low consistently.
Given her history of recurrent PE's she underwent CTA which showed acute PE's in the segmental anterior and posterior segments of the right superior lobar artery, also LLL infiltrate.
VS prior to transfer were: HR 71, BP 132.63, RR 16, POx 96% 2L (92% RA) on Levophed 0.08mg.kg.

Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE 69yo female with COPD, ulcerative colitis, diverticulosis s/p partial colectomy, and 2 PE's in the past on chronic Warfarin with IVC filter who presented to the ED for chest pain and was found to have PEs and pneumonia  --Active issues--  #Pulmonary embolus: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has h/o 2 PEs in past and had IVC filter placed in [**2106**].
At admission, her INR was 3.1 and she was found to have a PE on CTA chest.
Heparin drip was transitioned to Loevenox 80mg (1mg/kg) sc q12h given that she had a PE on therapeutic coumadin.
Anti-Xa level was 1.26 at discharge, Lovenox dose will be adjusted as an outpatient.
Heme/onc was [**Year (4 digits) 4221**] and antiphosphopipid antibody was sent which is pending at discharge.
TTE was performed which showed normal EF and no evidence of right heart dysfunction.
CT abd/pelvis showed no evidence of abdominal or pelvic malignancy but noted thrombus in the IVC filter.
BP was stable off pressors since arriving in the MICU.
Her PE's are small, with no evidence of RV dysfunction/strain and no cardiac biomarker elevation, so her PE is an unlikely cause for the hypotension.
After 3L IVF, her BP was much improved.
She did not require any further BP support and was transferred to the floor where her BP remained stable in the 90-110s.
All EKGs this admission show Q waves in the inferior leads which were not present on her prior EKGs from many years ago.
