At OSH, initial vitals were T 97.4 BP 199/85 HR 76 RR 28 87% on 4L nasal cannula.
CXR showed a LLL pna.
ABG was 7.43/30/51 on an unclear amount of oxygen.
WBC was 10.3.
BNP was 114.
In the ED, initial VS T 100, BP 134/84, HR 96, RR 22.
Patient was 89% on NRB, and RR in 30s, so was intubated.
CXR confirmed a LLL pneumonia.
BPs dropped to 70s-80s on propofol, so sedation was switched to Midazolam and Fentanyl.

Recurrent UTIs: Most recent cultures ([**2110-5-7**]) grew pan sensitive kleb pnemonia and corynebacterium, but in the past has  grown out resistant strains of pseudomonas sensitive only to meropenem ([**3-6**]), to amikacin ([**2-3**]).
QTc was 499-536 despite holding meds and given daily magnesium and potassium.
Most recent OMR note: secondary to recurrent infections and that intermittent catheterization led to hydronephrosis.
Discharge Physical: T 97.8, P 75, BP 126/78, RR 18, O2 99% on 40% trach mask Notably changed for patient having new tracheostomy.

Bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate in size on the right, and small on the left  Chest Radiograph [**2111-9-16**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-15**], the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion appears to have decreased.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2111-9-14**]: Conclusions: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2110-3-24**], regional and global systolic function have improved.
No organisms were obtained from initial BAL or sputum cultures so this treatment was empiric.

You required mechanical ventilation to help with your breathing, and ultimately had a tracheostomy tube placed.
Your liver and kidney function were generally normal during the hospitalization.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Discontinued cefpodoxime, an antibiotic you were taking before your admission - Discontinued cholestyramine, loperamide and tincture of opium, because your diarrhea improved and these can worsen your digestion of your tube feeds - Discontinued prochlorperazine (Compazine) because it can interact with METOCLOPRAMIDE, which we started at 5 mg with meals and at bedtime, to help you digest your tube feeds - Decreased your dose of SIROLIMUS to 1 mg daily, to keep it at the appropriate levels - Started HEPARIN injections, 5,000 units subcutaneously, three times daily, to prevent blood clots - Started NYSTATIN oral suspension, taken orally four times daily AS NEEDED for thrush - Started SENNA, one tab taken orally twice daily AS NEEDED for constipation - Started LIDOCAINE patch 5% adhesive patch applied topically for 12 hours at a time, followed by 12 hours off, as needed for back pain - Started PANTOPRAZOLE 40 mg tablets, taken orally once daily - Started MEROPENEM, an antibiotic to treat your pneumonia.
