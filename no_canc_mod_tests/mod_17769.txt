At [**Hospital3 **], EKG raised concern for NSTEMI.
She was hypertensive with improved respiratory status, RR 20's with O2 sats 93% on RA improved to 99-100% on 2L.
EKG here revealed new anterolateral ST depressions and elevated cardiac enzymes (trending downward).
Her heart rate was not controlled with metoprolol or diltiazem boluses.
She developed shortness of breath and CXR revealed likely pulmonary edema.
Exam was notable for swelling in her right hip/leg raising concern for a fracture.
She had an XR performed which revealed that she had a left proximal tibia and fibula fracture.

Another EKG from 17:46 with a fib at a rate of 155.
CXR ([**2201-2-10**]): Worsening CHF with upper lung zone redistribution and perihilar haze.
Echocardiogram was deferred as it was felt that the results would not change management given her goals of care.
The day after admission, she returned to AFib with HR in the 130 - 140's refractory to a diltiazem drip.
She was pharmacologically cardioverted with procainamide on [**2201-2-11**] to sinus rhythm with HR 50 - 60's.
On [**2201-2-13**] her blood pressures were fairly high and she was restarted on lisinopril 20 mg QD (half of her home dose of 40 mg QD) with hydralazine PRN for breakthrough SBP > 170.
Chest x-ray showed a questionable opacity, and she was started on a seven day course of cefpodoxime for a possible pneumonia.
In [**2199**], her creatinine was 0.9; it was 1.2 on admission on [**2201-2-10**].
She likely had some degree of ARF from poor forward flow in the setting of AFib with RVR and CHF, and her creatinine improved to 1.0 with better rate control.
