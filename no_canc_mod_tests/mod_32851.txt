At that time, EKG showed TWI in V3-V6 with 1mm ST depressions in V2-V3.
His HCT upon admission was 47.2, but by the afternoon the day after admission, his HCT decreased to 40, even in the setting of 1 unit pRBC.
Pt was started on protonix gtt and GI performed EGD on [**2200-9-8**], which per accompanying report, showed no varicies, no current bleeding, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] C esophagitis, clotted blood int he entire stomach adn duodenum, with a large duodenal bulb ulceration/fistula just past pyloric channel with mild oozing, clot exudates.
GI there recommended emergent surgery, but surgery declined and suggested IR angiography and embolization and so he was transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
His most recent Hct 40%.
On HD # 6, he underwent an upper GI study which showed no evidence of duodenal leak.
Tachycardic to 138 with SBP 100, and vomited 850cc of bright red blood and was getting 2 units pRBC en route.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is tachycardic to the 130s with SBP in the 90s.

#HCV - Diagnosed 3 years ago with cirrhosis documented on OSH CT abd/pelvis.
#Diabetes, type 2 controlled - Patient's FS were monitored and he was maintained on ISS with adequate glycemic control.
QTc was monitored daily.
