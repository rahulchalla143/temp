He was admitted on [**2-16**], the day prior to assessment as an outpatient to evaluate and assess his exercise tolerance testing which was abnormal.
A cardiac cath showed severe AS with an aortic valve area of 0.76 cm2, LVEDP 32, 90% left main, 100% LAD, 100% circumflex, 100% right lesion.
Coreg 3.125, [**2-10**] tablet po qd.
His pedal pulses were nonpalpable but his feet were warm.
PREOP LABS:  White count 5.6, hematocrit 37.0, platelet count 139,000, sodium 137, K 4.0, chloride 103, bicarb 27, BUN 28, creatinine 1.8, blood sugar 119.
INR 1.1.
Chest x-ray showed no significant process.
At the time of evaluation, carotid studies and echo were pending.
He had a T-max of 97.9.
He was in sinus bradycardia in the 50s, with a blood pressure of 110/45, PA pressures 42/29, with an index of 2.1.
The RVAD flow was at a 5 liters with a VAD rate of 67, and the patient remained in stable condition but critically ill with multiple drug support, on the RVAD, and the intra-aortic balloon pump.
White count was 7.5, hematocrit 31.8, K 3.8, BUN 26, creatinine 2.0, INR 1.4.
They were asked to consult for volume management, noting his baseline creatinine of 1.718 was now 2.2.
The patient's chest was open at the time in the ICU.
A chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.
Blood gases 7.46/32/130/23 and a base excess of 0.
At the time, the patient's index was 3.4 with PA pressures of 36/26, and a CVP of 11.
The patient remained in sinus rhythm with a blood pressure of 101/47.
The patient very early in the morning at 1:00 am on [**2-26**] was seen by general surgery on consult for evaluation of continuing decrease in urine output, increasing acidosis.
pH continued to worsen and got as low as 7.20 with a base excess of -8, and a lactate of 15.
Given the critically ill nature of the patient, they felt that abdominal exploration would be futile at the time, and the resident discussed this with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**], the attending from general surgery.
The patient continued on the RVAD and intra-aortic balloon pump with a blood pressure of 87/42, heart rate in the 70s, with an index of 2.7, with the RVAD and intra-aortic balloon pump.
Creatinine rose to 3.8.
White count rose to 16.4.
Hematocrit dropped to 27.0.
Total bilirubin climbed to 1.3.
AST 898, ALT 235, and a worsening lactic acidosis with a severely elevated lactate.
He was paced at a rhythm of 80 with PA pressures of 47/32, an index of 2.7, on maximal pressor support, with a blood gas of 7.29/37/80/19/-7.
White count 16.4, creatinine 3.8.
INR rose to 2.2 with a PT of 18.2.
At approximately 11:00 am, the patient experienced a progressive drop in his blood pressure with wide complex tachycardia, worsening acidosis, and anuria.
