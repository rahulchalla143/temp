The patient denied any symptoms of radiation, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, but did note that this burning chest pressure lasted approximately 15 minutes and was relieved with rest.
Evaluation at an outside hospital with exercise treadmill test showed positive findings with reversible anterior defect and ejection fraction of 47%.
The patient thereafter was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for cardiac catheterization.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  As of [**2167-5-15**], sodium 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate 29, BUN 13, creatinine 1.0, glucose 94.
White blood cell count 7.3, platelets 210,000, hematocrit 25.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.8, pulse 74, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 111/80, respirations 12, saturation 97% on room air.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Sternotomy site revealed no evidence of erythema, no evidence of serosanguinous drainage.
Palpation of the sternum revealed no evidence of click.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 59-year-old male with no prior history of coronary artery disease who presented with positive exercise treadmill test and positive cardiac catheterization results revealing LMCA distal 50% occlusion at bifurcation, LAD 90% occlusion at D1, LCX less than 50% ostial involvement but occluded OM1, RCA severe proximal-mid disease with midtotal occlusion.
The patient maintained sinus rhythm and good spontaneous breathing with 100% oxygen saturation on nasal cannula.
By postoperative day number two, the patient's Neo-Synephrine was weaned off and the patient's clinical status continued to improve.
Although the patient initially refused transfusion, because the patient began to develop symptoms of lightheadedness and gait instability, 1 unit was transfused with the patient's final approval.
At this time, cardiac echocardiogram was also obtained which showed that the ejection fraction was preserved.
Carotid duplex revealing no evidence of significant leaking.
The patient was initiated on Lopressor after blood pressure stabilization and transferred to the floor.
