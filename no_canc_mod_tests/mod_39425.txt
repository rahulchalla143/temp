She was admitted to the ICU for neuro checks which were intact throughout her time in the ICU.
This CT was not obtained as the patient able to participate in neuro checks.
Events in the TICU were the following: [**1-3**]: admitted to TSICU.
She remained alert and oriented and neuro checks were performed q8h, with no changes in neuro status.
Her vitals signs were routinely monitored and she remained hemodynamically stable.
It was noted that her O2 saturation was decreasing to the high 80's on RA.
However, difficulty remained weaning supplemental oxygen and a chest xray was obtained  on [**1-9**] which showed a very small right pleural effusion  (old) and new, small loculated, right pleural or extrapleural fluid.
However the xray showed resolution of prior pulmonary edema when compared to prior xrays, no new focal consolidation, and no evidence of prior pneumothorax seen initially on CT scan at admission.
Her blood sugars were monitored routinely and managed with her home metformin and a sliding scale of regular insulin as needed.
