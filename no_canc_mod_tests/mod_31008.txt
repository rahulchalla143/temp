Per the patient's daughter, patient had increased "gurgling," increased hyperglycemia on finger stick blood glucoses, and anorexia secondary to increasing dysphagia.
Prior to admission, the patient's finger stick glucoses were noted to be greater than 500 and her temperature was measured at 101.6 on the evening prior to admission.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was noted to have a lactate of 6 and was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit via the sepsis protocol and received Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl prior to transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 104.2; blood pressure 157/56; pulse 106; respiratory rate 30; 95% on 2 liters by nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No sinus tenderness, mucous membranes dry, oropharynx without any lesions.
Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, non-distended, normal active bowel sounds, no rebound or guarding.
LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood count 30.3; hematocrit 43.7; platelets 391; sodium 153; potassium 6; chloride 114; bicarbonate 28; BUN 63; creatinine 1.5; glucose 411; lactate 6.4; 89 neutrophils; 0 bands.
Urinalysis showed pH 5 with moderate leukocyte esterase, 250 glucose, [**7-15**] red cells, greater than 50 white cells, many bacteria.
Chest film showed full lung volumes, no ..........., pleural effusions or pneumothorax with a possible lingular infiltrate; electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 105 beats per minute with normal axis, normal intervals, borderline left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage, no ST or T-segment changes when compared with a prior electrocardiogram and no T-waves.
Her creatinine improved somewhat over the course of hospitalization, it was 1.6 on transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the general medical floor.
Patient was noted on the floor to have a temperature of 101 as well as worsening respiratory distress.
The patient's oxygen saturation rate was 96% on 3 liters initially on transfer to the medical floor, though subsequently, patient developed a worsening oxygen requirement and was noted to desaturate to 86% on 3 liters with a respiratory rate of 48 followed by the initiation of a non-rebreather with improvement of her oxygen saturation rate to 90%.
Arterial blood gases demonstrated significant hypoxemia with pH of 7.40, CO2 of 28, and an O2 of 69 on the non-rebreather.
