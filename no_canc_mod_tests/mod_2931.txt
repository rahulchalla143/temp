CT Torso: TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without oral or intravenous contrast due to the patient's acute renal failure.
NON-CONTRAST CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is a 20-mm low-density lesion within segment VIII/VII of the liver (3:16), which is nonspecific and cannot be further evaluated on this non-contrast CT. Sludge layers within the gallbladder.
The adrenal glands, spleen, and intra-abdominal small and large bowel loops are normal.
Exam for renal abscess is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
CT OF THE PELVIS: Foley catheter is seen within a decompressed bladder.
Evaluation of the renal abscesses is limited due to lack of IV contrast, however, there are no secondary signs of renal abscess.
Admission labs notable for WBC 20.5 without associated bandemia.
She was in acute renal failure up to Creatinine of 4.5 from baseline of 0.8.
LP performed with 5 WBC, 2 RBC, 0 polys, 92 lymphs, protein 35, glucose 107.
Head CT without acute pathology, CT abd/pelvis without hydronephrosis, intra-abdominal abscesses, signs of pyelo but exam limited as no IV contrast given.

The IV acyclovir was continued until CSF PCR was negative for VZV, and pt pulled out her IV's before results were back for HSV PCR.
# Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 0.6 - 0.8 with most recent Cr in [**9-24**] 0.8.
Her creatinine slowly improved back to baseline.
Fasting glucose up to 140s on a daily basis.
You will need to have an ultrasound of your kidneys in 6 months to futher follow up a cyst.
You also will need an ultrasound of your liver to further delineate a small lesion noted on the liver on CT scan.
