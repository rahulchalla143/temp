# HHS: Glucose elevated to 1053 on admission with anion gap 25, hemoconcentrated to Hct 54.
Urinalysis demonstrates 9 WBC and few bacteria (along with 3 epidermal cells).
Streaky RLL ifiltrate on CXR was thought unlikely to be pneumonia.
Ischemic cardiac event was ruled out with troponins x 4.
On transfer to the floor from the MICU the patient was stable and her blood sugar was being controlled with SQ insulin regimen.
Urinalysis demonstrated 9 WBC and few bacteria (along with 3 epidermal cells).
Urine culture with 10-100K gram positive cocci concerning for lactobacillus vs. group a strep.
[**12-24**] sets of blood cultures were positive for coag negative staph which was thought to be a contaminant.
Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was treated for her UTI with 3 days of levofloxacin.
Lisinopril and furosemide were held as patient initially demonstrated pre-renal azotemia with initial creatinine to 1.3 which responded to 0.9 with IVF.
Please start these as you see fit if her blood pressures become elevated as her systolic blood pressure have been in the 110's prior to discharge here and thus we didn't start them.
A second round of blood cultures are pending on discharge given coag pos staph in blood culture on admission.
