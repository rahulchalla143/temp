He presented to the [**Hospital6 256**] for elective cardiac catheterization on [**2121-12-3**].
His cardiac catheterization at that time showed an ejection fraction of 56% with 70-80% occlusion of the right posterior descending artery, 100% occlusion at the right posterior lateral artery, 60% occlusion of the left main coronary artery, 40% occlusion of the lymphadenopathy coronary artery, and 70% occlusion of the obtuse marginal 1 coronary artery.
Vitals signs:  Heart rate 63 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 118/64, oxygen saturation in room air at 95%.
Neck:  Supple with 2+ palpable carotid pulses and no bruits.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Once in the Intensive Care Unit, he was found to have labile blood pressures and was hypotensive with stimulation.
This prompted use intermittently of a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain his mean arterial pressure greater than 70.
He was found to have high sanguinous output from his chest tubes later that evening and an activated coagulation time of 123 and was at this time reversed with 50 mg of Protamine and 1 U of platelets.
He was found to have a stable hematocrit and platelet count.
During postoperative day #1, his blood pressure remained stable, and he was able to be weaned off of Neo-Synephrine drip.
At the time of discharge, the patient was in no acute distress with a rate in the 70s and in sinus rhythm showing no ectopy.
His blood pressure was stable, and his room air oxygen saturation had improved to 96%.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with slightly decreased breath sounds at his bases bilaterally.
