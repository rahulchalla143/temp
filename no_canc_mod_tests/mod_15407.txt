Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Exam notable for stiff neck with [**Month (only) **] ROM, decreased withdrawal on left side compared with right, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, clonus, upgoing toes.
An EEG was performed while she was still in the ICU that showed the presence of aslow, low voltage background rhythm in the delta and mid theta frequency ranges.
Prior to discharge her dose was increased to 130, 100, 100 because of a level of 7 (corrected for her albumin was 10).
She was transferred to the floor on HD 3 in improved condition and her neuro exam was at her baseline at the time of discharge, with L hemiparesis.
She also showed some evidence of pneumonia on her CXR and the vantin was continued for this as well.
ECHO showed low-normal EF (50-55%).
FEN/GI: Iniitally she required an NG tube but after transfer to the floor she passed her swallow evaluation for ground solids which she tolerated well.
Heme: Initially, because of the concern for new stroke/hemorrhage, she was given FFP and Vit K in ED to correct her INR.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
