Clinical correlation and additional testing suggested including culture and detection of serum antibody.
CXR [**2184-8-8**]: Volume of moderate left pleural effusion and severity of left lower lobe consolidation have increased slightly since [**8-10**], but the difference could be due to transient findings such as retained secretions and a sympathetic pleural exudate.

His urine legionella antigen was positive and he was narrowed to levofloxacin.
Serum and urine tox were negative.
[**Last Name (un) **]/CKD: Patient was admitted to OSH with creatinine of 2.4 that improved with IVF.
His Cr stabilized to 1.7 prior to discharge and his kidney disease was thought to be secondary to underlying untreated hypertension.
UTI:  The patient was admitted with a UA that could be consistent with UTI but UCx at OSH was negative.
With resolution of his hematuria, his hematocrit has been trending back up and was stable at discharge.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on [**2184-8-20**].
Also, your kidney function was noted to be elevated and we attributed that to the underlying infection along with likely long-standing untreated high blood pressure.
While you were here, we controlled your blood pressure with specific medications that we would like you to continue after you leave.
