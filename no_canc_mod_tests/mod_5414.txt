ECG unchanged from ECG at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on presentation.
- ECHO:  [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]: echo with moderate pulmonary hypertension, mildly dilated R ventricle with preserved systolic fn, normal LV function.
CT chest at [**Location (un) 620**] read as: evidence of ventricular septal bulge and pulmonary embolism involving all branches of the left and right pulmonary arteries along with pulmonary artery hypertension.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
Transmitral Doppler E>A and TDI E/e' <8 suggesting normal diastolic function, and normal LV filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-12-12**], the right ventricle appears smaller with better systolic function.
LE Doppler [**2131-12-13**] FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and Doppler images were obtained of bilateral common femoral, femoral, popliteal, and tibial veins.
#pulmonary embolism - At rest pt completely asymptomatic, presented only with some dyspnea when climbing stairs.
Although prior hypercoagulable workup in [**2127**] was reportedly negative, pt likely has some underlying propensity for clotting and it was felt that accordingly the IVC filter would likely clot off within several weeks, possibly prior to removal.
Hypercoagulable workup sent and pt was started on warfarin.
Factor 10a levels were measured and were therapeutic on lovenox.
ECG with no evidence of right heart strain.
Pt was monitored on telemetry without events.
BP monitored and remained stable.
#Ground glass opacity on chest CT - found on presentation to [**Location (un) 620**].
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) needs outpt f/u CT scan for pulm nodule noted on CTA chest.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on Monday [**12-17**] with results to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25373**] at the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 25374**] clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25375**].1   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
At this time, your oxygen level is normal and your heart rate and blood pressure are stable.
You will be discharged on lovenox injections until your INR is more than 2.0.
You will need to have your INR checked on Monday [**2131-12-17**] at the [**Location (un) **] lab and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25373**] will call you with the result.
