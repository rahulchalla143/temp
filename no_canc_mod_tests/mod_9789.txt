Patient underwent redo TIPS on [**1-28**] and was found to have portal vein thrombosis causing poor flow through the TIPS with a gradient of only 15.
An attempt was made to place an NGT but his oxygen saturation dropped to 80s and was placed on 5L NC.
He was placed on NRB with oxygen sats to 98-100%.
Head CT showed evidence of hydrocephalus.
Neurology was called and they stated that the study is consistent with NPH and this should not cause acute change in mental status.
CXR was concerning for RLL consolidation.
On arrival to MICU his vital were T 97.8, HR 89 afib, BP 130/D, RR 27, 99-100% NRB.
CKD 9.
No wheezes, crackles, rhonchi Abd: +BS, NT, distended with fluid wave, soft Ext: Trace edema B/L Neuro: 5/5 strength, sensation intact to light touch, no asterixis Psych: appropriate, AOx3 Skin: no rashes   Pertinent Results: [**2124-1-21**] 02:20PM   PT-19.5* PTT-38.1* INR(PT)-1.8* [**2124-1-21**] 02:20PM   PLT COUNT-123* [**2124-1-21**] 02:20PM   WBC-5.8 RBC-3.27* HGB-12.3* HCT-33.0* MCV-101* MCH-37.7* MCHC-37.4* RDW-15.6* [**2124-1-21**] 02:20PM   CALCIUM-8.1* PHOSPHATE-4.6*# MAGNESIUM-0.8* [**2124-1-21**] 02:20PM   ALT(SGPT)-29 AST(SGOT)-49* ALK PHOS-119* TOT BILI-3.2* [**2124-1-21**] 02:20PM   GLUCOSE-107* UREA N-21* CREAT-1.4* SODIUM-130* POTASSIUM-4.4 CHLORIDE-96 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-15 [**2124-1-21**] 10:05PM   HCT-34.8*  CXR [**1-28**]: Lung volumes are lower, accounting in part for larger cardiomediastinal silhouette but cardiac size and mediastinal vascular engorgement have worsened.
non-con CT head [**1-31**]: Markedly limited study.
Cardiac Echo [**2-1**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The pulmonary artery pressure was not adequately determined .
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2120-5-15**], the right ventricle is now dilated and hypokinetic.
CTA chest [**2-2**]: 1.
Liver doppler/US [**1-30**]: 1.
Limited exam of the left lower extremity demonstrating normal compressibility without evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
Limited evaluation of TIPS with variable velocities, which were mostly at or above the prior baseline.
TTE showed right heart strain but CTA was negative for PE.
He was empirically treated with Vanc/Zosyn for possible HAP given infiltrates on CXR and hypoxia but abx were discontinued [**2-3**] since pt developed a rash and did not have any clear source of infection with no positive culture data and no fever or elevated WBC.
