However, sbp decreased to 60s (no improvement following d/c of nitro gtt).
CTA (-) for PE, showing diffuse ground glass opacities and bibasilar opacities (c/w pulmonary edema and aspiration).
Transferred to the floor [**3-11**] and doing well at this time  Past Medical History: 1) HTN 2) Hypercholesterolemia 3) h/o pancreatitis 4) lumbar radiculopathy s/p laminectomy 5) s/p bilateral hip replacements 6) h/o aspiration PNA  Social History: No tobacco or ETOH use.

Comparison was made to prior study dated [**2181-7-29**].
CHEST (PA & LAT) ([**2182-3-6**]): FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size.
Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Echo ([**3-8**]): Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
CT abdomen and pelvis ([**3-10**]): FINDINGS: Evaluation of the lung bases demonstrates bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
This is less severe than on a prior examination although the entire lungs are not evaluated on today's exam.
Evaluation of the deep pelvis is slightly limited due to artifact from the indwelling bilateral hip arthroplasties.
Evaluation of the bone windows demonstrates no osseous blastic or lytic lesions.
This is better evaluated on the prior CT and MRI of the lumbar spine.
Evaluation of the deep pelvis is slightly limited as described above.
The peak systolic velocities bilaterally are normal, as are the ICA to CCA ratios.
Sputum culture ([**3-10**]): GRAM STAIN (Final [**2182-3-10**]): <10 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2182-3-12**]): SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
MRI was negative for acute CVA.
CTA was negative for PE but showed bilateral consollidations concerning for aspiration PNA.
CXR showed florid CHF so the pt was diuresed with lasix 40 mg IV and started on a nitro drip.
However, her SBP decreased to the 60s at that time and the pt required intubation.
A CTA was concerned given a concern for PE but this was negative.
At this time, she has an oxygen saturation in the mid 90s on room air.
Blood cultures have been negative to date and sputum cultures grew only oropharyngeal flora.
A CT was obtained that diverticulosis and fluid at L4-L5 of the spinal processes.
Blood clutures were sent which are negative to date.
As the pt remained afebrile on the floor with negative blood cultures and no new murmer, a TEE was not obtained.
Head CT and MRI were negative for evidence of acute infarct.
Carotid US was obtained [**3-12**] which showed widely patent arteries.
