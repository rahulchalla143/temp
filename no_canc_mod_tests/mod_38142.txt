CXR [**5-31**]:  IMPRESSION: Mild CHF.
Chest CT is recommended for further evaluation to exclude a mass in this region.
CT abdomen [**6-1**]:  IMPRESSION: 1) Foci of decreased enhancement in both kidneys consistent with pyelonephritis.
CXR [**6-1**]:  FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with the patient in upright position is compared with a recent similar study (half hour interval).
The liver is of normal echogenicity and echo texture without focal lesions.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation s/p recent hospitalization for ablation, discharged on [**5-18**], who returns with fatigue x 3 days, and fever to 102 with chills, found to have UTI by UA and evidence of pyelonephritis on CT scan, hypotension on admission responsive to 4 L IVF, thought to be urosepsis.
Urine culture shows e-coli and one blood culture showed gram negative rods.
[**2-8**] blood cultures from [**5-31**] were positive for GNR.
Post hydration, patient was euvolemic to hypervolemic - she had rales at bases, CHF on CXR [**5-31**], we encouraged PO intake and patient did not require further IVF.
Also, patient got 2 U PRBC which also helped volume status.
Random cortisol was done and was appropriatly > 25.
CT was negative for RP bleed.
Patient was transfused on [**6-1**] and hct remained stable after that.
Iron studies were done, Iron 31, TIBC low, Ferritin elevated.
6) LFTs: LFTs noted to be elevated on [**6-2**], however patient had no abdominal pain or tenderness.
She underwent RUQ US that was normal (see report above).
Likely this is a result of hypotension on the liver during her initial presentation and would be expected to improve.
