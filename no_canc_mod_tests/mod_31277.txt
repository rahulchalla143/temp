Admission Date:  [**2114-10-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-10-25**]   Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Echo [**10-22**] Cardiac Cath [**10-23**] Cardiac Cath [**10-24**]  History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft [**2109**] and PCI in [**2110**] who presents with exertional angina, doe and pnd with + stress test for cardiac cath.
She had a stres test on [**2114-9-4**] showing LV dilation with exertion.
Pt direct admit for cardiac catheterization on [**10-22**].
Mild AS on Cath in 99   Social History: The patient lives alone in [**Hospital3 4634**] in [**Location (un) 538**] with a granddaughter involved.
[**Month (only) **], BP 102/67, HR 70, RR 20, O2 sat 94%RA  Gen:  Pleasant spanish elderly female.
Neuro:  communicative, grossly intact   Pertinent Results: Echo: [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated, EF 15%, severe global LV hypokinesis, 2 X 1.2 cm globular thrombus in LV.
Cath [**2114-10-22**] 1) Native vessels.
3) Hemodynamics - mean RA pressure of 13 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 17 mmHg.
The cardiac output was severely reduced at 2.5 L/min with an SVR of 2592 dynes-sec/cm5.
There was also evidence of pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 72/23/40 mmHg and a PVR of 736 dynes-sec/cm5.
Left ventricular filling pressures were not obtained due to the patient's known LV clot.
Cath [**2114-10-23**]  1) Coronary arteries -The LAD had severe proximal and midvessel disease with distal competitive filling via the SVG-LAD.
LCx as above cath [**10-22**].
2) Resting hemodynamics revealed central hypertension with blood pressure 170/82 mmHg.
PA systolic pressures were elevated at 39 mmHg.
Mean PCWP was 11 mmHg.
Cardiac index was 1.9 L/min/m2 by Fick.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow.

Pt admitted for cath [**2114-10-22**].
Pt's Creatinine was 1.5 on admission and pt received mucomyst and bicarb hydration prior to cath on [**10-22**].
Pt also had an echo done prior to cath, which showed a 2X1 cm thrombus in LV.
Echo [**10-22**] was remarkable for global hypokinesis and a thrombus in LV cavity.
Hemodynamics at cath on [**2114-10-22**] were PCW 18, PA 62/21, CO (Fick) 2.43 and CI 1.63 at cath and pt transferred to CCU.
Hemodynamics on cath [**10-23**], PA 45/20, PCW 11, CO 4.7, CI 3.1.
3) CRI - Creatinine on admission 1.5.
Creatinine 0.9 post cath [**10-23**], in setting of post cath hydration.
Her creatinine was 1.2 on [**10-25**] which maybe near her baseline creatinine.
She should have Potassium and Creatinine checked on [**10-26**].
4) LV thrombus - Pt with a 2X1 cm thrombus on Echo [**10-22**].
Her sugars remained in 100-210 range.
Lisinopril was held post cath since pt had received 2 dye loads in 2 days.
CHF 5.
CRI (baseline creatinine ~1.2)   Discharge Condition: Fair  Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
