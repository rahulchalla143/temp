CXR ([**1-9**]): Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
CXR ([**1-10**]): Cardiomegaly is stable.
ECHO ([**1-10**]): Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
EKG ([**1-11**]): NSR, no acute ST/TW changes.

Infectious hepatitis and AIH labs were negative.
EGD revealed 4 cords of Grade 2 varices.
Renal ultrasound no evidence of obstruction or hydronephrosis.
Repeat urine lytes showed that she was pre-renal with UNa < 10, FeNa 0.08%.
HRS was considered and treatment with albumin, octreotide and midodrine was initiated.
Creatinine improved at the time of discharge to a stable value of ~1 .
She was treated for a UTI/pneumonia, but other infectious work-up was negative .
# UTI:  Urine culture positive for E coli, treated with Cipro for 3 days.
Later urine cultures negative.
# Respiratory distress and MICU course:  On the night of [**1-9**], the patient spiked a temperature to 101 and developed a new oxygen requirement.
A CXR was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
She was initially subject to Section 12 for 3 days, however this was discontinued as her mental status normalized with treatment.
This will need outpatient follow-up.
