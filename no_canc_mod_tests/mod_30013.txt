UA and blood cultures were sent.
EKG was showing afib, lbbb old.
She underwent a bedside echo at ED showed poor squeeze, CXR was notable for LLL consolidation and cardiomegaly and CT head was negative for intracranial lesions.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
-CXR ([**2142-11-20**]) - Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased.
-CT head ([**2142-11-20**]) - 1.
Extensive opacification of the left maxillary sinus, is concerning for inverted papilloma, though a sinonasal polyp might also have this appearance; dense appearance can relate to soft tissue contents, dense contents with/without blood products.
Dedicated CT Sinus imaging can be considered after routine ENT consult.
#Cardiogenic shock/hypotension - There was initial concern for cardiogenic vs septic shock at presentation.
CVP was 18-20 suggesting cardiogenic shock.
Repeat TTE showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and EF=15%.
A right heart cath was not performed because the patient declined further invasive procedures and this was determined to not be consistent with her goals of care.
#Altered mental status - Etiology remained unclear, head CT during this admission showed no acute intracranial process.
MS was likely worsened by her hypotension and potential infection, which were treated with pressors and antibiotics, respectively.
Her Cr remained stable at 1.9-2.1 during this admission, which is slightly elevated from her baseline of 1.7.
# Afib with LBBB - Her rate remained well controlled, she was not on beta blockers at home and none were given during this admission [**1-10**] hypotension.
#Supratherapeutic INR - INR at admission was 4.1, as mentioned above.
INR trended up to 5.0 despite holding warfarin.
Her INR may have increased because of the broad spectrum antibiotics started during this admission.
We think your blood pressure is low because your heart is not pumping effectively.
