Admission Date:  [**2186-3-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-3-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-7-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7881**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness:  75 year old man with mild dementia, CAD, s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1/OM2, SVG to PDA),  and prior stent to OM2 graft, PVD, s/p fem [**Doctor Last Name **] in [**2174**], HTN, Aortic stenosis, CRI (cr 1.9), DM admitted on [**2186-3-4**] to [**Hospital3 **] with chest pain that was not relieved with nitro.
BP came down to 150.
EKG showed NSR with rate 75bpm, 1st degree AVB with IVCD and 1mm ST depression in lateral aspect with no change from prior EKGs.
On admission he also had SOB and CXR that was reportedly consistenet with CHF as well as mildly elevated BNP (627).
His troponins then rose with peak troponin of 4.77 and CKMB 16.8.
Last cath ([**2181**] at [**Hospital1 2177**]) showed patent grafts and 60% stenosis in SVG to OM2 which was not intervened upon.
In [**2180**] patient had cath at [**Hospital1 18**] and had stent placed in SVG to OM2 graft.
It was decided to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath and potential intervention on the OM2 lesion.
VS prior to transfer:  144/68, 59 SB, 20, 97.6, 95% on room air.
There he underwent cardiac cath with attempted intervention on OM2 lesion at end of previously placed stent, however, they were unable to pass the wire and no intervention was done.
Selective graft angiography demonstrated a patent SVG-OM1 and SVG-rPDA.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
(reportedly), in [**2181**] anatomy as follows: patent grafts, 60% distal stenosis in the SVG to Om2- medical, mangement continued.

Physical Exam: VS -  T 97.3 HR 61bpm BP 168/67 RR 20 O2sat 96% RA Gen: Elderly male in NAD lying flat HEENT: NCAT.
The LAD and LCX were occluded proximally, and the RCA occluded distally.
Selective venous conduit angiography revealed a patent saphenous vein grafts to OM1, OM2 and PDA.
Nonselective angiography of the LIMA demonstrated a tubular 50-60% stenosis in the mid LAD.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2181-2-2**], lateral wall hypokinesis is not seen on the current study.
[**3-14**]: R Groin U/S preliminary: .
CAD: Cath showed stenosis at end of stent in OM2 that was unable to be intervened upon.
This would resolve with BP control and the EKG changes would come down to baseline, his last episode of chest pain was on [**2186-3-11**].
His HR was in 60-70s at time of discharge and his Carvedilol was increased to 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **] .
LVEF 55% reportedly on TTE at OSH but did have symptoms of CHF requiring diuresis.
Repeat ECHO on [**3-9**] showed 55-60% EF, mild regional left systolic disfunction with hypokinesis of the bassal or mid inferior inferolateral segments.
After [**3-9**] he remained euvolemic on exam and did not require further diuresis or oxygen.
Patient had moderate-severe AS (valve area 0.9cm on prior TTE) which was not evaluated during catheterization.
Repeat TTE on [**3-9**] showed a moderate AS (*1.3 cm2) so it was thought more likely that the chest pain was from his CAD not the AS.
Initially his HCTZ was held given dye load at cath and concern for contrast-induced nephropathy, however, creatinine remained stable at 1.7.
Was fluctuating throughout hostpital stay with elevations thought to lead to chest pain/demand ischemia.
He will reqiure further follow up and uptightration of medication for goal BP of < 130/80.
psychomotor slowing he underwent a CT head which was consistent w/ dementia.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain.
You had a cardiac catheterization that showed that you have a blockage.
Unfortunately, nothing could be done about the blockage.
Should you experience further chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, faintness, severe weakness or any other symptom concerning to you, please call the doctor at your rehabilitation facility or go to the emergency room.
