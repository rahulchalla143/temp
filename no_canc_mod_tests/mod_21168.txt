She was taken emergently to [**Hospital6 2561**] where head MRI revealed a left PCA infarct on DWI with abrupt cut-off of the left P2 branch.
Initial read of the emergent CT was concerning for a small occipital bleed, and the patient was admitted to the NeuroICU.
Final read, however, showed no hemorrhage, just an area of increased contrast.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Pupils 3 to 2mm bilaterally, directly and consensually.
Sensation was intact to Light touch, pin prick, temperature(cold), vibration, and proprioception.

This high attenuation material represents blood and contrast from the patients recent cerebral angiogram.
Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
A follow up CT is recommended in [**11-20**] days to assess interval change.
----- Angiogram [**2108-1-31**]: Occlusion of a left P2 branch of the posterior cerebral artery with successful thrombolysis after infusion of approximately 20 mg of intraarterial TPA.
The post-procedure angiogram showed significant improvement of flow to the previously occluded left P2 posterior cerebral artery branches.
----- CT head [**2108-2-1**]: Again demonstrated within the left occipital lobe is an area of low attenuation, not significantly changed since the prior study, consistent with infarction within the distribution of the left posterior cerebral artery.
----- Bilateral LENIs [**2108-2-2**]: No evidence of DVT in the right or left lower extremity.
----- Echocardiogram [**2108-2-2**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Bubble study is positive for right-to-left shunting at rest and with maneuvers.
Findings on exam and imaging were consistent with left PCA infarct.
Stroke:  The patient presented with a left PCA infarct, confirmed by head CT and MRI.
She was monitored on telemetry without findings of arrhythmia.
Goal INR on coumadin is 2-2.5.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1356**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60976**].
Given the patient's age and negative risk factors for stroke, a transesophageal echocardiogram was done to look for an embolic source.
Lower extremity dopplers were done to rule out DVT and were negative.
A hypercoagulable work-up was initiated, including studies for lupus anticoagulant, protein C and S deficiency, activate protein C mutation, antithrombin III mutation, factor V Leiden, and anticardiolipin antibody.
Additionally, a rheumatologic work-up was initiated.
Goal systolic blood pressure in the acute and subacute phase is 120-130.
The patient's blood pressue was lower than this, running in the 90s-110s.
Hematology: Hypercoaguable panel was sent prior to initiation of anticoagulation.

Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Coumadin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime: Goal INR is [**12-22**].
