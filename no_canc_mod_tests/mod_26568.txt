The patient reported no signs of bleeding or melenic stools since the evening of [**8-4**] and thereafter, his HCT was stable and had been trending upward.
Pain was treated with Dilaudid, first IV, then PO.
However,  C. Diff and stool cultures were negative.
# Mechanical mitral valve replacment on warfarin with goal INR 2.5-3.5.
Given INR of 14 on admission, warfarin was held.
Heparin drip started when INR decreased below 2, while Coumadin was still being held.
Once the patient's GI workup was complete (as above) with no further bleeding, warfarin was restarted.
You were transferred here because you were bleeding in your digestive tract and had abdominal pain, as well as an INR of 14.
To assess your bleeding and pain, we performed CT-scans of your abdomen and the GI team performed several endoscopies.
On your day of discharge, your INR was 1.3 and we switched you to an injectable blood thinner, called Enoxaparin.
You should START enoxaparin (Lovenox) every 12 hours until your INR is between 2.5-3.5.
Followup Instructions: Please followup with your PCP to check/adjust your INR and warfarin dosing: .
