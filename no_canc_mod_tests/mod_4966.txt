Past work ups for these falls include [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts on [**7-23**] which showed no recorded events and an echocardiogram on [**8-23**] which revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 60 percent.
An MRI of the head on [**9-22**] showed mild to moderate cerebral atrophy with diffuse mild to moderate areas of chronic microvascular infarction.
TSH on [**7-23**] was 4.1.
Lungs, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood count, 13.6; 76% neutrophils; 13% lymphs; 9% monos.
Chemistry, sodium, 135; potassium, 4.3; chloride, 94; bicarbonate, 31; BUN, 23; creatinine, 0.8; glucose, 131; magnesium, 1.7.
Urinalysis on admission was specific gravity, 1.02; glucose negative; negative ketones, negative blood, negative nitrite, trace of leukocyte esterase.
0 red blood cells.
21 to 50 white blood cells.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, rate 84.
Head CT revealed microvascular disease in the white matter, a large hematoma of the right paroccipital region.
C spine revealed no fracture.
Head CT at that time was again negative.
This third head CT performed showed a 2 cm right frontal hemorrhage, left frontal hemorrhage, likely both subarachnoid and subdural.
Of note, INR actually on admission was 1.7.
The patient was sent to the SICU and treated with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.
Her INR reversed from 1.7 to 1.1.
The patient had a C spine CT done which showed marked degenerative changes in C5 through 6, C6 through 7, with moderate spondylitic ridges, prominent left sided facet joint degeneration causing moderate spinal cord compression.
Bilateral neuroforaminal narrowing of 2 to 3 mm, subluxation of C3 to C4, C4 to C5, which was unchanged compared to MRI on [**9-22**].
Neurosurgery recommended repeat neurological examinations and keeping her systolic blood pressure greater than 150.
Repeat CT of the head was done which showed stable right frontal and right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Her neurological examination was stable.
Her blood pressure was maintained between 140s and 160s.
In order to accomplish this, the patient was started on Norvasc with Hydralazine ridden for systolic blood pressures greater than 160.
As work up for possible causes of her fall, the patient had another echocardiogram performed.
Echocardiogram was read as left ventricular wall thickness.
Cavity size and systolic function, normal.
Left ventricular ejection fraction, greater than 55%.
The patient's sodium was noted to fall following head trauma.
Fluid restriction was decreased from 1,000 cc per day to 750 cc per day.
Urinary tract infection - The patient was initially started on Ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection, however, cultures came back positive Klebsiella which was resistant to Ciprofloxacin.
Repeat cultures were negative.
Blood pressure - The patient's blood pressure was, at times, difficult to control.
The patient blood pressure remained well controlled on this regimen, however, near the end of her hospital course, it was slightly higher.
Headaches - The patient had several severe headaches following her head trauma.
Rehabilitation - The patient was seen by Physical Therapy who initially felt the patient would require a short term rehabilitation stay, however, the patient and family was against this.
