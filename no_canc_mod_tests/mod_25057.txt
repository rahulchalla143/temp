On arrival to the OSH he had a head CT which showed vasogenic edema in the bilateral frontal lobe around the midline and then an MRI with contrast that showed a mass in the frontal lobe with surrounding edema.
He had a spinal tap with 10 WBC (5% PMNs, 80% lymphs, 15% monos, gram stain and culture negative, AFB negative, no opening pressure recorded).
Finger to nose testing normal.
PE Upon Discharge: non-focal Incision- C/D/I, 2 staples from EVD site closure  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS:  [**2184-1-2**] 06:15AM BLOOD WBC-7.0 RBC-4.96 Hgb-15.1 Hct-43.8 MCV-88 MCH-30.4 MCHC-34.5 RDW-12.4 Plt Ct-364 [**2184-1-3**] 01:59AM BLOOD PT-13.8* PTT-21.2* INR(PT)-1.2* [**2184-1-2**] 06:15AM BLOOD Glucose-92 UreaN-13 Creat-1.2 Na-137 K-4.3 Cl-101 HCO3-28 AnGap-12  IMAGING: MRI [**1-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Slight increase in ventricular size compared to preoperative studies.
CT Head [**1-3**]: IMPRESSION: Interval placement of EVD via right frontal approach with tip at the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
Otherwise similar examination with postoperative hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space, along the basal cisterns and within the fourth ventricle.
MRI Head [**1-4**]: Residual enhancing tumor,moderate in extent, which appears to arise from the posterior aspect of the cribriform plate and extends along both sides of the contiguous falx cerebri.
CT Abdomen [**1-8**]: IMPRESSION: Normal chest CT within the limitation of the study technique.
CT Head [**1-8**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 34 year old male with 2 weeks of headache and vision changes, subjective fever, neck stiffness who was admitted to and OSH with brain mass and transferred for second opinion.
An EVD was subsequently placed and leveled at 10.
Post-extubation, the patient's neurologic examination was unchanged relative to pre-op.
Preliminary pathology result was consistent with granuloma with caseating necrosis.
His EVD was raised to 20, and his ICPs stayed well below 20.
He appeared orthostatic and his neuro exam was intact immediately after the fall.
His post-pull CT was stable and he also had a CT torso looking for signs of pulmonary TB which showed no pulmonary nodules.
Given that ID recommended starting him on Ethambutol, amongst other TB medications, opthamology was consulted to do a baseline exam and follow him post-operative.
RPR and FTA-ABS were added on per Rheumatology request.
You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to this appointment.
