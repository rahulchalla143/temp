Prenatal screens were notable for A positive, direct Coombs negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune and Group B Strep.
Heart rate was stable.
Mother was transferred from [**Hospital3 38285**] and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care due to the probable twin-twin transfusion.
The infant received bag-mask ventilation in the delivery room and Apgars were 7 at 1 minutes and 8 at 5 minutes.
Due to respiratory distress, the infant was endotracheally intubated and brought to the NICU for further care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, weight was 828 g, head circumference of 25.25 cm and length of 34.5 cm.
Heart rate was 164, respiratory rate 60, temperature 96.1 initially and that increased to 97.3.
Initial blood pressure was 45/22 with a mean of 32.
Oxygen saturation was 93% in 37% oxygen.
Initial chest exam was notable for moderate intercostal retractions and fair breath sounds bilaterally, coarse crackles noted in both lung fields.
The infant was pale with moderately decreased perfusion, regular rhythm and rate, femoral pulses normal, normal S1 and S2 no murmur appreciated.
Initially, the infant was on settings of 22/6 and a rate of 25.
Due to persistent desaturation on day of life #1, the infant was changed to a high frequency oscillator with a maximum mean airway pressure of 14.
Currently, the infant is on nasal cannula of 300 cc with an FIO2 ranging between 21% and 30%.
Due to a birth weight of less than 1000 g, the infant was also treated with vitamin A to receive a total of 12 doses.
No significant murmur has been appreciated since then except on day of life #21 when the infant was noted to have an intermittent murmur associated with anemia with a hematocrit of 25.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: The infant's birth weight was 828 g. The infant currently weighs 1110 g. Head circumference on [**7-24**] was 26 cm and the length was 35.5 cm.
The lowest sodium was 124 on day of life #23.
A most recent set of electrolytes was day of life #24 with a sodium of 130, potassium 5.4, chloride 93, bicarbonate of 29.
A repeat set of electrolytes are pending and will be sent on [**2158-7-25**].
Infectious Disease: The infant initially was neutropenic with an ANC of 1305.
The initial white blood count was 4.5 with 28 polys and 1 band.
This white blood cell count decreased to a low point of 1.9 and a low point with an ANC of 696.
By day of life #12, the infant's white count had normalized to 6.9 with an ANC of 2890.
A spinal tap demonstrated 0 white blood cells on day of life #7.
Blood culture was no growth.
Hematology: This donor infant had an initial hematocrit of 27.6 for which he received 1 PRBC transfusion, 20 cc/kg, on day of life #1.
When repeat hematocrit was 29%, the infant received a 2nd packed red blood cell transfusion on day of life [**1-8**].
The 3rd and last blood transfusion was given on day of life #20 of 20 cc/kg for a hematocrit of 25.
The infant also had thrombocytopenia with an initial platelet count of 89 and that decreased to 57 requiring 1 platelet transfusion.
The most recent platelet count was on day of life #21 of 472.
The most recent white blood cell count was 10.9 on day of life #21.
GI: Phototherapy was started at 12 hours of age with a maximum bilirubin at that time of 6.4 and was discontinued on day of life #12.
The most recent bilirubin noted was 2.7 on day of life #16.
The 1st head ultrasound on [**6-30**] documentation is not available in the computer at this time.
However, repeat ultrasound on [**7-5**] results are available and this head ultrasound at 1 week of age was notable for periventricular echogenicities, as noted previously on [**2158-6-30**].
A follow-up ultrasound was done on [**7-13**] that showed normal echogenicity of the periventricular white matter which is symmetric with no cystic change to suggest PVL.
Sensory - Audiology: A hearing screen has not been performed at this time and will need to be done prior to the infant's discharge home.
Car seat screening will need to be done prior to the infant's discharge home.
