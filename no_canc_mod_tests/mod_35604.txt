Underwent cath which revealed severe three vessel disease.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %).
POSTBYPASS: LV systolic function appears hyperdynamic (LVEF>55%).
The study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.
There is a small left apical pneumothorax that is more apparent on today's examination than on [**2196-4-16**] and that appears similar to [**2196-4-15**].
