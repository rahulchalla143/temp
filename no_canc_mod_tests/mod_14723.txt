The patient underwent an exercise treadmill test in [**2135-12-12**] which showed an ejection fraction of 27% and was positive for evidence of ischemia.
The patient was referred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization showed an left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 30, PA pressures of 69/20, 100% proximal left anterior descending lesion and 100% first diagonal lesion, 100% mid circumflex lesion, 100% obtuse marginal one, 100% right PDA and 100% RPL.
The patient had an echocardiogram done at that time which showed left atrial enlargement and global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No aortic insufficiency, two plus mitral regurgitation, one to two plus tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary artery hypertension and an ejection fraction of 20%.
Status post renal cell carcinoma in [**2121**]; status post nephrectomy with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 to 2.1.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: 1.
LABORATORY:  Preoperatively showed a hematocrit of 34.7 and creatinine of 2.7.
Intraoperative TEE revealed and EF of 15% and 2+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] improved to 30% postoperatively and the MR decreased to 1+.
On the morning of postoperative day number one, the patient had liver function tests done which were significant for an amylase of 1700 which, on repeat, was found to be 2700.
A General Surgery consultation was obtained and a CT scan was obtained which showed an unremarkable gallbladder, two small granulomas in the right lobe of the liver, some fatty infiltration of the pancreas without enlargement or fat stranding around the pancreas, grossly patent celiac and superior mesentery artery.
With these findings, the General Surgery Team of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was significantly concerned for mesenteric ischemia and the decision was made to take the patient to the Operating Room for an exploratory laparotomy.
The patient's creatinine which had been 1.8 on postoperative day number one began to rise to 2.3 on postoperative day number two and continued to rise and peaked at 3.0.
By postoperative day number three, the patient's potassium was stable and no longer remained elevated.
The Renal Team felt that the patient needed more fluid resuscitation and with which his urine output increased.
The patient's chest tubes which had been placed during the initial operation continued to have significant amount of serous output.
The patient's albumin had been checked and was found to be 1.7.
It was recommended that the patient receive 25 grams of albumin as well as taking chest tubes off suction; the chest tube output decreased and the chest tubes were removed on postoperative day number six.
The Neurology attending felt that perhaps the patient had some subtle neurologic findings and recommended obtaining an MRI at a future date as the patient could not have an MRI at that time due to the staples on his incisions.
A CT scan obtained showed no acute process and no evidence of a stroke.
Chest tubes continued to have a moderate amount of serous drainage.
Chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Temperature maximum 98.2 F.; pulse 81 in sinus rhythm; blood pressure 120/64; respiratory rate 18; room air oxygen saturation 93%.
Laboratory data was white blood cell count of 7.0, hematocrit 28.1, platelets count 206.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.1, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, BUN 29, creatinine 1.9, glucose 115.
The patient's weight on [**3-30**] is 88 kilograms; preoperatively the patient was 83 kilograms.
Breath sounds are decreased at the left base; otherwise clear.
