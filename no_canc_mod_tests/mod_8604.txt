TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the chest were obtained without administration of IV contrast.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a central line through the right subclavian vein, ending in the mid-SVC.
The upper part of the abdomen visualized on this study appears unremarkable except for atrophic kidneys with marked vascular calcification.
Blood cultures from the 16th showed no growth Blood cultured from the 17th showed coag positive staph (prior to removal of AV graft) Tissue from the AV graft grew out MRSA Blood cultures from 18th, 20th, and 21st showed no growth  RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2159-11-28**] 11:50 AM  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: please assses for liver hematoma, abscess, or any other acut  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 47 year old woman with ESRD on HD s/p kideny [**Hospital **], here with MRSA bacteremia but now s/p liver biopsy and PD catheter placement and with intense abdominal pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please assses for liver hematoma, abscess, or any other acute abdominal process (patient is immunosuppresed) CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired following administration of oral contrast only.
COMPARISON: Chest CT from [**2159-11-25**].
CT OF ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a small right pleural effusion, which has decreased in size since [**11-25**], with associated basilar atelectasis and peripheral pleural calcification, also unchanged in appearance.
Evaluation of the solid abdominal organs is limited without IV contrast.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The trasplanted kidney is identified in the right lower quadrant.
Cultures from the 17th (prior to graft removal) also show MRSA, but surveillance cultures have all been negative.
patient had a TTE which showed no evidence of endocarditis, but a TEE was done to confirm this.
In addition patient was initially started in ceftriazone for ?pna but maintained on azithro to tx her pna - started Ceftriaxone (initially), azithro for pneumonia (dc'ed on the 21st) - repeat CT -resolution of air-space disease, also evidence of small bilateral pleural effusions (per attnd these had attempted to be tapped previously but were to small for tap)  2.
Metabolic Acidosis: Related to renal failure, infection, hyperglycemia in setting of metabolic alkalosis from n/v, we continued to monitor her gap (on admission was 21).
Gap closed as patient had a stable dialysis regimen and glucose was better controlled   3.
Hyperglcemia: Patient has very severe diabetes and is very sensitive to insulin, therfore [**Last Name (un) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] to help manage her diabetic regimen  4) CRF: patient was maintained on HD (MWF) on immunosuppressive agents  6) HTN: patients blood pressure was controlled with CCB and ACE, hydral prn (not using beta blocker as may mask signs of hypoglycemia)  7) Diastolic HF: dialysis dependent  9) Abnl LFTs- patient liver was biopsied when the AV graft was removed- pending results  10) Epilepsy: we continued to monitor tegretol levels  11) Anemia: hct 38 on admission to 23.6 on [**11-24**] (patient also had some blood loss with removal of AV graft).
Attempted to transfuse her on [**11-23**]- patient spiked a temp to 101, hemolysis work up was negative - likely nonhemolytic febrile reaction.
Iron studies were also sent, in [**Month (only) 462**] iron studies were consistent with chronic disease and recent studies show the same.
