Operational workup thus far has shown specific IgG antibody negative on multiple insulin regimens.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile at 97.8, blood pressure 126/72, pulse of 88, respiratory rate 20, and 97 percent on room air.
In general, a well-developed, well- nourished, Hispanic male, looking very comfortable in no acute distress, alert and oriented x 3.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination is soft, nontender, nondistended.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 7.8, hematocrit 38.8, and platelet count 163.
Chemistries:  Sodium 136, potassium 6.1, chloride 103, bicarbonate 23, BUN 25, creatinine 1.3, glucose 420, calcium 9.6, magnesium 1.7, and phosphorus 3.5.
ALT 15, AST 12, and CPK 2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Rashes/Urticaria:  The patient was initially admitted under the supervision of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**] from Allergy for further evaluation of the patient's urticarial skin reactions thought secondary to insulin.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for further help and management of his diabetes given that his blood sugars are elevated in the setting of markedly elevated steroid requirements.
Also of note, he had had previous IgG antibodies documented as negative when exposed to insulin.
There ultimately was a trend towards moving patient towards shorter-acting insulins and even a, thought about possibly insulin pump.
However, 1-2 days after his ICU stay, patient had another reaction, which he thought was secondary to Regular insulin administration.
After having been abstaining from all antihistamines x 2 days and using Medrol at higher doses to mitigate urticarial reactions, patient underwent skin testing for various insulins.
The skin testing results showed that patient did not have an allergy to insulin after all.
The plan at this point was to restart patient on Lantus and a sliding scale insulin [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 9718**] recommendations.
