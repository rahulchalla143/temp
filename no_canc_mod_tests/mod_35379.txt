He was rewarmed in the unit and taken back to the OR for exploration of 3 stab wounds to his neck.
Head CT showed intraventricular hemorrhage and a neurosurgical consult was obtained.
Serial head CT scans were followed and the initial follow up scan did reveal an increase in the intraventricular hemorrhage.
His neurologic status was watched closely, a repeat head CT on the next day remained stable with no interval increase.
He will follow up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] for repeat head imaging.
An MR of his head and orbits were done which did show a right inferior rectus muscle into the fracture defect.
Plastics felt that this was caused by superior orbital fissure syndrome and recommended that he see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2398**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital3 2576**] for evaluation and treatment in the next several weeks.
He had a fever work-up which revealed pan-sensitive E. coli in his urine.
A CT scan of his abdomen confirmed a post-operative mechanical obstruction.
