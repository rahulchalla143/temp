CARDIAC CATH [**7-16**]: Cardiac catheterisation used a L-femoral approach, after failed to access narrow R-radial.
Diagnostic component revealed RCA: 80% mid, 85% distal; Cx: 70%; LMS: 20%; LAD: prox 40, mid 40%.

Cath showed LMCA ostial 20% stenosis, distal 3+ calcification, LAD proximal 3+ calcification with 40% calcification and mid 40% stenosis, LCX had a proximal 3+ calcification with 70 % stenosis, RCA had a 3+ calcification of proximal, mid 80% and distal 85%.
Will need further work up with ABI as inpt or once discharged.
Chronic Issues Managed:  # COPD: Findings on lung exam and low ECG voltage suggest significant emphysematous changes.
Per family he was more confused then baseline during admission  Transitions of Care: 1.Pt needs follow up for PAD 2.Consider adding ACEI if BP tolerates 3.
Information was obtained from Family/Caregiver.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to this hospital from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] hospital after a test showed that you had some blockages in your arteries.
You had a cardiac catherization which showed a blockage in your right coronary artery that was opened with 2 bare metal stents.
You had a heart attack during the procedure but an echocardiogram showed that your heart is functioning well, although there is an area that is not contracting.
