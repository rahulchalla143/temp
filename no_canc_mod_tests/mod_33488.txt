He was found to be hypotensive and with a Hct of 17 from 30 on admission.
He was hypotensive during periods of acute bleeding and required IVFs to maintain his blood pressure.
His BP and Hct remained stable on the floor and he had no more episodes of UGIB until the week of discharge.
Hematocrit was stable, but do to original presentation, there was concern for repeat UGIB.
Flex Sigmoidoscopy showed internal hemorrhoids and rectal ulcer, not actively bleeding, but with brown stool above.
Hematocrit was monitored and stable through discharge on [**2164-9-12**].
His Cr increased from baseline of 0.8 to 3.0.
A diagnostic paracentesis was done that ruled out SBP.
His presentation was consistent EtOH hepatitis with Tbili 37 and INR 1.9.
Once his UGIB was undercontrol and his renal function was improving he was transfered to the floor.
On the floor his Tbili and INR remained elevated.
Flex sigmoidoscopy revealed internal hemorrhoids and rectal ulcers with brown stool above, so this was sufficient to account for the bleeding.
