Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system  revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal central aortic pressures.
The abdominal aorta was noted to be extremely tortuous on arterial access, requiring placement first of a 5F long sheath up to the iliac bifurcation before advancing a magic torque wire could be advanced to the aortic arch.
A 55cm [**Last Name (un) 28712**] sheath was advanced to the mid-abdominal aorta to provide support for the diagnostic angiography, which was otherwise uncomplicated.
[**2168-11-4**] ECHO PRE-CPB:1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %).
Sinus rhythm at 100 bpm.
