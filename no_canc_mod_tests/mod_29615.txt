PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the vital signs as follows:  Blood pressure 136/80, heart rate 115, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
Pulses examination showed Dopplerable femorals bilaterally, Dopplerable popliteals bilaterally, absent DP and PT on the right and Dopplerable DP and PT on the left.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs included the CBC, white count of 12.5, hematocrit 35.3, PT/INR normal.
BUN 24, creatinine 1.4.
The EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 110, no acute ischemic changes or Q-waves.
Chest x-ray showed no active cardiopulmonary disease.
Urinalysis showed trace blood, 1000 glucose, negative ketones.
The PTT was monitored sequentially to maintain a goal PTT of 60 to 80.
She underwent arteriogram on [**2147-12-6**], which demonstrated two focal stenosis in infrarenal aorta; occlusion of the right iliac, but the femoral-popliteal graft and SFA were also occluded with segmental reconstruction of the AK popliteal.
She underwent carotid noninvasive, which showed internal carotid artery on the right 60% to 69%, on the left less than 40%, but normal antegrade flow of the right and left vertebral arteries.
Post procedure the BUN was 39, creatinine 2.1.
The patient was hydrated and her renal function was monitored.
Postoperative hematocrit was 25.
The potassium was 3.0 and this was supplemented.
During the postoperative course, from day #1, she ran a low-grade temperature from 101 to 100.5.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained.
Blood cultures were not finalized.
The maximum total white count was 18, which defervesced over the next 48 hours.
The post transfusion hematocrit was 30.8.
She underwent an arteriogram on [**2147-12-11**], which showed a patent ABF right limb.
Heparin was continued and Coumadin was initiated for goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
At the time of her discharge, the creatinine was 1.4, white count 16.0.
Chest x-ray was unremarkable.
NPH 35 to 38 units q.a.m.
and 18 units of NPH at bed time; regular sliding scale lunch, dinner, and bedtime as follows:  Glucoses less than 100 no insulin; 151 to 200 no insulin; 201 to 250 two units; 251 to 300 three units; 301 to 350 four units; greater than 351 five units.
Bedtime insulin:  No insulin unless glucoses greater than 300, give two units, and glucoses greater than 350, three units.
goal INR two to three, continued to monitor on a daily basis until she is at a steady state at her goal INRs.
hold for systolic blood pressure less than 105 and heart rate less than 70.
