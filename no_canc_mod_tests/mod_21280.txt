Head CT showed a dense RMCA M1 thrombus extending up to M2.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for possible neurointerventional procedure.

CT perfusion study suggests acute infarctions in the superior right middle cerebral artery territory and in the right posterior cerebral artery territory.
These are not yet detectible on the conventional CT images, with only a small focus of mild cytotoxic edema noted in the right anterior insula.
MRI/MRA head and NEck 1.
The previously seen occlusion of the superior division of the right MCA is not completely included in the field of view of today's study given that the study is a neck CTA.
The patient had a MRI head which showed large acute infarctions involving the right frontal lobe, insula, and temporal lobe in the middle cerebral artery territory and the right occipital lobe in the posterior cerebral artery territory as well asa focal hemorrhagic conversion.
CT head was obtained 24hours after tPA and showed no progression of hemorrhagic conversion noted on MRI the previous day.
A repeat CTA of the neck showed decreased thrombus of the right common carotid.
Cardiac: The patient was monitored on telemetry and remained in atrial fibrillation.
Her cardiac enzymes were negative.
Her heart rate trended up and her metoprolol was increased to her home dose.
Echocardiogram revealed a PFO.
Endocrine: Her fingersticks were checked and she was placed on sliding scale insulin.
Glycohemoglobin was normal and LDL cholesterol was <100.
She was started on Ceftriaxone for UTI, urine culture pending at this time.
(for LDL > 100) () Yes - (x) No (if LDL >100, Reason Not Given: ) 6.
(x) Yes - () No (if LDL >100, Reason Not Given: ) 10.
Information was obtained from Family/Caregiver.
Aspirin 325 mg PO DAILY stop when INR [**12-26**] 8.
Your LDL cholesterol was 66.
You had a cardiac echocardiogram which demonstrated no cardioembolic source, but did show a patent foremen ovale.
You were checked for blood glucose control with a HgB A1c.
The level was 5.6 which is normal.
