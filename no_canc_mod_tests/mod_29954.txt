HEAD CT: 1.
C-SPINE CT: Marked degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: 1.
Left adrenal indeterminate lesion, which can be further evaluated on subsequent noncontrast CT imaging, or dedicated adrenal MRI.
Small left parietal extra-axial subacute hematoma in keeping with CT findings of [**2105-10-20**].
During hospital course, pt was noted to be increasingly hypoxic, requiring facemask to keep saturations in high 80's upon admission to MICU.
Studies consistent with exudative effusion with > 100 K RBCs and 1800 WBCs, pH 7.47.
CTA to r/o PE was also considered; however not obtained as pt did improve s/p thoracentesis and pt likely lives at lower O2 sat given severe emphysematous changes seen on chest CT on admission.
Repeat NCHCT showed stable bleed, no new hemorrhage.
EEG showed diffuse slowing but no epileptiform waves.
Hct was stable during hospital course.
