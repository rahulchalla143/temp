Her Hct were monitored and stable.
On transition to the floor, the patient was satting mid-90s on 2L NC.
She was therapeutic on her coumadin with INR peaking at 3.8 and heparin drip was discontinued after two days of therapeutic INR.
Coumadin was held when INR > 3 with instructions for her to restart coumadin when INR <3.
She was weaned down on her oxygen to 1-2 L by time of discharge with instructions to increase nasal cannula if oxygen levels fall below 92%.
Her HCT remained stable in the high 20s and upon discharge her Hct was 31.0.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
#Hypertension: Home diltiazem was held on admission for SBP in 100s while in the MICU, but after transition to the floor, her pressures increased that patient was restarted on her Diltiazem, with pressures stable in the 130s systolic.

You were hospitalized because your oxygen levels were low at the nursing home.
When you got to the hospital we did some imaging of your lungs and found a blood clot in your lungs that was causing your decreased oxygen levels.
We started you on medications that will thin your blood, and your breathing and oxygenation levels have been improving.
While you are on this medication, it is very important that you check your blood levels of this medication.
After the first two weeks, you can start checking your blood levels 2 times per week when your levels become stable.
The CAT scan of your lungs showed an incidental nodule in the thyroid.
We made some changes to your medications: START Coumadin; your dosage and schedule for taking the medication will depend on the blood level.
Hold coumadin until INR<3; start coumadin at 2mg daily when INR is between 2 and 3  Followup Instructions: You will be seen by a doctor at your nursing facility    Completed by:[**2120-8-18**
