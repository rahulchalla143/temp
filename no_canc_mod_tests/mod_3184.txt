PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 103.9?????
?, heart rate 108, blood pressure 130/70.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 19.3, hematocrit 35.3, platelet count 333, 84% neutrophils, 5% bands; coags within normal limits.
Chemistries with a sodium of 138, potassium 3.6, chloride 98, bicarb 26, BUN 75, creatinine 2.6, glucose 176.
Left lower extremity cellulitis:  The patient was initially started on Oxacillin; however, the fevers persisted over the next 24-48 hrs and white cell count continued to escalate.
Shortly thereafter, the patient developed delirium and the patient's white blood cell count continued to climb to 30,000, and he was clinically worsening.
Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen consistent with sepsis.
CT of the leg did not demonstrate any abscess but the study was done without contrast due to renal impairment.
MRI was unable to be performed given that the patient had a surgical clip in the ethmoid sinus.
A LE Ultrasound was done which did not any focal fluid collections and a gallium scan was also done which confirmed these findings.
Surgical culture eventually grew Oxacillin resistant staph aureus.
His white blood cell count slowly trended down and was 11,000  on [**2133-10-12**].
Vancomycin was dosed for levels less than 15.
On [**2133-10-12**], a PICC line was placed, and his Vancomycin is to be continued until [**2133-10-26**].
This was in the setting of sepsis from the leg infection but with careful fluid management and supportive treatment, his creatinine improved back to 2.0 on [**2133-10-12**] close to his baseline.
The patient initially had his immunosuppressants held except for the Prednisone given that he had an acute infection.
Diabetes:  Initially the patient's blood sugars were difficult to control, and the patient was placed on an insulin drip while he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Left lower extremity cellulitis, culture positive for MRSA.
Coronary artery disease, EF 35-40%.
Need to check Vancomycin levels periodically to assure levels < 15.
