At [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital, his blood urea nitrogen was 183 and creatinine was 60 with a bicarbonate of 14 and anion gap of 18.
He was then admitted to the MICU and was treated with emergent hemodialysis for a bicarbonate of 7 and potassium of 6.0.
His creatinine at that time was down to 22.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was afebrile, heart rate 95, blood pressure 153/93, respiratory rate 22.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 15.2, hematocrit 42.0, platelet count 216,000, 81% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes,  Sodium 130, potassium 5.7, chloride 85, bicarbonate 8, blood urea nitrogen 178, creatinine 22.2, glucose 132, anion gap 33.
Calcium 9.5, magnesium 3.1, phosphate 16.3, troponin 0.08.
Chest x-ray shows mild congestive heart failure.
Head CT negative for bleed, but small hypodensities bilaterally towards the vertex in the frontoparietal region.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute.
Acute renal failure - Initially, the patient was treated in the MICU with emergent hemodialysis for a bicarbonate of 7 and potassium of 6.0.
Renal ultrasound showed enlarged kidneys bilaterally with left measuring 14 centimeters and right measuring 13 centimeters.
Now after two weeks, his urine output is beginning to increase to 200cc per 24 hours.
His initial laboratories on [**2177-11-14**], were negative for ethylene glycol, acetone methanol and isopropanol with a serum anion gap of 33 and plasma osmolar gap of 15 but acute renal failure may cause both elevation in the serum anion gap and osmolar gap, making these uninterpretable.
Serum anion gap and plasma osmolar gap - Suspected polyethylene glycol ingestion although complicated by the fact that acute renal failure can cause both to be elevated.
Urine output continuing to increase.
Decreased mental status - Concern for intracranial hemorrhage initially but head CT negative for bleed.
Increasing white blood cell count - White blood cell count initially was 15.2 and has now increased up to 23.0.
KUB examination is negative.
Blood cultures are no growth to date.
We will check a repeat chest x-ray although he has had no infiltrates on past chest x-rays.
Likely secondary to fluid overload and improved saturation with tighter blood pressure control and more frequent dialysis.
Will check a chest x-ray today to rule out any pneumonia.
Disposition - The patient will likely be discharged to rehabilitation facility with outpatient dialysis treatment when white blood cell count is improved and his hypertension is controlled.
