HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old male with a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20%, chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of roughly 2, and atrial fibrillation diagnosed in [**2137-12-7**], who was in his usual state of fair health until the last several when he started noticing that he was dizzy with orthostatic symptoms.
Dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, clean coronary arteries, 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of around 2, has been rising recently).
Last esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2137-9-2**], which showed antral gastritis.
Last colonoscopy on [**2138-2-7**], showed five sigmoid polyps and grade II internal hemorrhoids; also diverticulosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Admission physical examination revealed vital signs with a temperature of 96, pulse of 73, blood pressure of 150/70, heart rate of 19, oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm, normal rate.
Rectal examination was heme-positive, black/tarry stool.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Admission laboratories revealed a white blood cell count of 9.9, hematocrit of 16, and platelets of 255.
PT of 43.7, PTT of 45, INR of 13.3.
AST of 29, ALT of 36, LDH of 209, amylase of 88, total bilirubin of 0.2.
SMA-7 revealed sodium of 139, potassium of 4.2, chloride of 105, bicarbonate of 24, blood urea nitrogen of 51, creatinine of 2.2, blood sugar of 134.
Digoxin level of 1.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or opacifications.
Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 73.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on [**5-15**] which revealed a moderate reducible hiatal hernia but a normal stomach and duodenal mucosa.
After the patient's 3 units of packed red blood cells, his hematocrit was stable at 26, and he had no further melenic stools.
The patient's INR came down to 1.2 over the first 48 hours.
Iron studies sent one month prior to admission showed the following:  An iron of 36, a TIBC of 472, and ferritin of 19.
His hematocrit remained stable at 26, and his INR was stable at 1.2.
The patient's Diovan was restarted after his creatinine had come down to 1.8 (which was in his baseline range).
The patient will need to arrange an appointment for a small-bowel follow-through; and after those results are obtained an appointment will need to be arranged with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17185**] of Gastroenterology for further followup.
