The patient had multiple episodes of nausea, chest pressure, chest discomfort, and epigastric pain over the past two weeks prior to admission.
She presented to an outside hospital where her electrocardiogram showed first-degree atrioventricular block with ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF; ST depressions in leads I, aVL, V2 through V6.
An interventional heart catheterization was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13584**] which demonstrated a right-dominant coronary circulation with left main coronary artery with a 30% tubular ostial calcification, left anterior descending artery 70% proximal lesion, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30272**] diseased first diagonal, left circumflex with 99% long stenosis involving the origin/proximal portion of first obtuse marginal which filled retrograde by left-to-left collaterals; likely very chronic but contributory to anterolateral ST depressions noted on electrocardiograms prior to transfer.
The right coronary artery with initial TIMI-II flow, sequential 90% tubular then 90% ulcerated hazy lesions just before short posterior descending artery (with 90% ostial) and large posterior left ventricular branches.
Her blood pressure went to 240/130, and the patient went into flash pulmonary edema.
At that time, the patient's blood pressure was at 189/101, and she was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination at the time of admission revealed heart rate was 122, blood pressure was 189/101, respiratory rate was 20, and the patient was saturating at 89% on 100% nonrebreather mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the oropharynx was clear.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed dorsalis pedis, posterior tibialis, and radial  pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times three.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed sodium was 140, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 119, bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was 15, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 122.
Initial INR was 1.3.
Blood gas revealed 7.37/34/71.
Creatine kinase was [**2118**].
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with 3-mm to 4-mm ST depressions in V1 through V6 (these were dynamic changes).
Status post catheterization with a left axis deviation, still with 0.5-mm ST elevations inferiorly.
She was asymptomatic with no nausea, chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, palpitations, or edema.
Her lung examination was markedly improved on her second hospital day with crackles halfway up.
An echocardiogram was performed on [**7-2**] which showed an ejection fraction of 50%.
Mitral regurgitation of 2+ and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
A chest x-ray from early on [**7-3**] showed likely congestive heart failure with a tortuous aorta, small pleural effusions (left greater than right), with pulmonary edema.
She did have two brief hypotensive episodes to a systolic blood pressure of 90 which quickly corrected with 250-cc boluses times two.
Her creatine kinases trended down nicely from 3092 to 2199 to 1456.
Her MB fractions also trended down from 401 to 221 to 110.
On [**2178-7-4**], the patient was changed from atorvastatin to fluvastatin because of a recent study indicating a mortality benefit from fluvastatin as opposed to atorvastatin when combined with Plavix.
A Physical Therapy consultation was obtained which showed the patient fully able to ambulate without becoming symptomatic.
