However, a run sheet describes her O2 sat as 84% on room air; she was placed on 5L and reached 100%, and stayed at this O2 saturation as this was titrated to 2L, and 1L NC.
Of note, on her previous admission, she had pulmonary and cardiology pre-op evaluation for possible cholecystectomy.
From a cardiology standpoint, she was considered low-risk, but pulmonary put her at a high risk for failure to wean from the vent based on a FVC of 1.4 and an FEV1 of 0.52; ultimately, with the resolution of her possible biliary symptoms, and these risks, surgery elected not to go forward with an operation.
Most recent PFTs from [**2118**]: FEV1 = 36% of predicted FEV1/FVC = 54% of predicted 2.
CHF - EF >65%, so presumably diastolic 4.

Chest x-ray and PFTs suggesting advanced COPD.
PFTs on [**2122-7-13**] were consistent with severe obstructive disease.
Repeat ABG on the floor showed improving CO2 and patient was discharged on [**12-5**] L O2 by NC.
