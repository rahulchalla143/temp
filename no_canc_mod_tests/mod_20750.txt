Her temperature was 101.6; blood pressure 129/62; heart rate was 121; respiratory rate was 30 and oxygen saturation on room air was 97 percent.
Lower extremity showed no swelling or erythema.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were present palpably bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission, white count was 20.3; hematocrit was 32.1; platelets were 426.
Coagulation studies showed PT to be 12.2; PTT 29.2; INR was 1.0.
She had a urinalysis that was hazy.
Specific gravity was 1.023.
Protein was 30.
Moderate leukocytes and 11 to 20 red blood cells.
White blood cells were greater than 50.
Sodium was 136; potassium of 4.1; chloride 94; bicarbonate 28; BUN 28; creatinine .3; glucose 115.
Urine and blood cultures were sent.
She had a chest x-ray done that showed linear atelectasis versus opacity in the right lower lobe.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.
She did have signs consistent with a urinary tract infection and, therefore, it was recommended that the Foley be changed and repeat urinalysis and urine culture were sent.
Her vital signs were stable.
Her temperature did come down.
Due to a falling hematocrit of 27, she did receive a unit of packed red blood cells on [**9-14**] after her hematocrit rose to 33.
Infectious disease did continue to follow and on a chest CAT scan, on [**9-14**], this showed a new right lower lobe consolidation.
All urine cultures showed yeast but grew out no bacteria.
The infectious disease team checked on the chest CT with cardiologist and felt that the picture was most consistent with atelectasis, and therefore, recommended that the Gentamycin could be discontinued.
