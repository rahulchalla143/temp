Since [**2134**] he has only been following up with a general gastroenterologist near his home, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of [**Hospital6 48601**].
At the OSH, head CT was negative for acute intracranial pathology.
Labs were notable for K 6.2.
CXR was notable only for low lung volumes.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, labs notable for K 5.9, Na 132.
Her BP was initially 100-110 systolic but fell to 80s with midazolam gtt.

Chest/abd CT [**3-10**]: 1.
Echo [**3-15**]: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
