The blood pressure response to exercise was mildly  exaggerated (232/80mmHg).
C. ECHO ([**2105-3-2**]) Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2098-9-3**], the left ventricular cavity size is smaller (now normal) and the heart rate is now lower.
His rhythm was mostly junctional with continuing long pause intervals (4 to 5 seconds at times) with continuing symptoms including feeling "awful, washed out, and nauseous."
An ECHO was performed on [**2105-3-2**] showing normal biventricular sizes and function with no overt valvular pathology.
He also had an exercise stress test to evaluate cardiac rhythm during and post-exercise.
The blood pressure response to exercise was mildly exaggerated (232/80).
Post-procedure CXR was within normal limits showing good lead placement.
# Hyperlipidemia He was continued on simvastatin  # Hct drop Labs on [**3-2**] showed Hct decrease from 46.1 to 35.3 with repeat labs stable at 44.7 -47.2 likely reflecting an isolated and spurious value.
# Transitional issues - Pacemaker follow-up  # Pending studies - follow-up final CXR report performed on [**2105-3-3**]  Medications on Admission: HCTZ 25 mg daily lisinopril 20 mg daily simvastatin 20 mg daily aspirin 81 mg daily propranolol 20 mg Q6H PRN hypertension (rarely takes) triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Medications: 1. hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
You had an exercise test that showed that your heart was doing well when you exerted yourself.
