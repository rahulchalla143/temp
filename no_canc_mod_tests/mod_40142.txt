Laboratory work-up revealed no evidence of hemolysis and the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
[**2138-11-22**] CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
He continued to have voluminous output from his G tube which was replaced to keep his systolic blood pressures greater than 90.
Also noted to have fever to 103.3 during initial transfusion, and workup for transfusion reaction was negative.
On discharge, HCT was 26 down from admission of 31 but remained relatively stable for several days and no further evidence of blood in Gtube output.
EGD was notable for portal gastropathy, large mucosal congestion.
large output could be [**3-12**] bleeding from Gtube.
Gtube fluid showed high amylase, of [**Numeric Identifier 40285**] and Tbili of 4.3.
RUQ ultrasound shows no biliary dilitation and pt is s/p cholecystectomy.
WBlood cultures showed no growth.
Concern that fevers could be aspiration pneumonitis after EGD but could also be translocation secondary to esophagitis.
Given the friable and denuded mucosa of his esophagus and the epinephrine administration during EGD CT chest/neck with contrast was considered to evalute for possible mediastinitis but pt's fevers resolved.
Of note, pt did have 1/4 bottles grow Gm positive rods c/w corynebacterium or propionibacterium species, but we felt this was a contaminant as his fevers were subsiding and all other blood cultures showed no growth.
Patient appears hypovolemic on exam and takes TPN and fluids at home on regular basis.
Creatinine up to 1.0 from baseline of 0.6.
- Strict Is&Os - OSH records .

We did an endoscopy and found that you had some bleeding in your esophagus, which was treated and we also gave you some blood through a transfusion.
You can weigh yourself and if your weight is going down several pounds this likely means you need to use more IV fluid.
