CT head [**10-22**]: (prelim) Unchanged tiny right frontal SDH and parafalcine SDH.
Plain films pelvis [**10-22**]: (prelim) suboptimal eval of sacrum due to overlying bowel gas.
CXR [**10-22**]: Diffuse bilateral infiltrates - ARDS vs. multifocal pneumonia, less likely cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
