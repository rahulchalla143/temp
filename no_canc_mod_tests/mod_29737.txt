Head CT revealed no acute intracranial process with bilateral parietal lobe atrophy.
EKG revealed 2-4mm STEs in Anterior Leads (V2-V4) with reciprocal STDs in II, III and aVf consistent with STEMI.
Troponin was elevated to 5.04 with CK of 339 and CKMB of 8.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 10 cm.

Imaging: Head CT ([**2145-2-23**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Widening of the extra-axial spaces overlying both parietal lobes, likely due to atrophy .
Pa/Lat CXR ([**2145-2-23**]): IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
TTE ([**2145-2-24**]): Conclusions The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2137-3-11**], wall motion abnormalities are new.
Specific signs of acute cholecystitis are not seen, however, if there is high clinical concern for acute cholecystitis, a Gallbladder HIDA scan can be obtained for further evaluation.
CT Abdomen and Plevis ([**2145-2-26**]): Findings consistent with acute cholecystitis.
F/U EKG the next day with evidence of Q waves which combined with normal CK/CKMBs and fact that history obtained after talking with family indicated that CP started at least 3-4 days before presentation made likely that pt had an MI but that had already completed infarcting by time of arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
TTE showed severe hypokinesis in the anterior/lateral/apical area with decreased EF (20-25%) compared to prior also consistent with recent anterior MI.
# Acute Cholecystitis: Initial labs showed significant elevation in transaminases as well as cholestatic labs (Tbili, Alk Phos) and synthetic function alteration (elevated INR).
Hepatitis panel showed immunization to Hep B and no evidence of active Hep C infection.
Pt then developed mild abdominal pain and an abdominal CT showed evidence of cholecystitis.
Cultures ultimately grew out Streptococcus species most consistent with strep bovis.
Head CT in the ER negative.
However, during afternoon of [**2-27**] urine output started to drop off to anuric levels and was non-responsive to 3.5L of fluid bolus.
This was thought most likely [**1-27**] to septic shock as BP was lowish at the time and required pressor support.
Pt had I/Os monitored and ECHO confirmed decrased EF as noted above.
Initially was able to make urine, but urine output later tailed off as renal failure worsened.
Initial sugars were very high with range in 500-600s in chemistry panels.
Pt started on aggressive ISS wth extra regular insulin which dropped blood sugar too aggressively the first night.
