Sigmoidoscopy showed non-bleeding grade 1 external hemorrhoids but no explanation for her bleeding.
EGD showed esophagitis and two non bleeding varices at the gastric fundus.
INR was elevated as high as 3.5 and it did not correct with multiple treatments with vitamin K which was ascribed to poor hepatic synthetic function.
# Intubation: The patient was intubated for the EGD and afterwards was not able to be weaned off the vent.
Blood cultures and CXR were negative but sputum culture grew pansensitive serratia and pansensitive enterobacter.
Bilirubin and INR trended upwards during this admission.
A RUQ U/S was performed to look for cause of worsening hepatic function which showed cholethiasis but not cholecystitis.
A TTE was performed which showed mild pulmonary artery hypertension but no evidence of right heart failure to cause congestive hepatopathy.
# Low Urine Output:  She presented initially with acute kidney injury with creatinine as high as 2.1 that was likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion in the setting of GI bleed.
Creatinine normalized to 0.7 prior to discharge however urine output stayed low.
BRBPR 2.
Endoscopy of your gut did not show any active bleeding though your mental status was worsened by medications given to sedate you.
