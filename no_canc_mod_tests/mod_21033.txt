HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a history of "severe" COPD with recent upper respiratory tract infection who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with a COPD exacerbation and was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure (ABGs 7.26/59/89) and is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Her urine culture was showing more than 100,000 gram-positive cocci which eventually grew out Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Her blood cultures were no growth to date.
Her white blood cell count went from 9,000 to 6,000 to 18,000 to 16,000 to 23,000 here at [**Hospital1 **].
Her transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside hospital was reportedly with a normal EF, moderate MR, moderate TR, normal regional wall motion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.8, heart rate 98, BP 127/71, respiratory rate 13, 02 saturation 97% on AC 650/12/5/0.40 with an ABG on this setting of 7.43/53/86.
Pertinent laboratories included a white count in the 20,000 range which progressed to a bandemia of 12% bands.
Second U/A on [**2163-5-22**] showed 6 white blood cells and less than 1 epithelial, large blood, 9 red blood cells, trace protein, occasional white blood cell clusters.
Renal function was within normal limits.
LDL 72, HDL 66, triglycerides 119, iron studies within normal limits with the exception of ferritin at 193.
TSH was normal at 2.5.
Digoxin level 1.2, lactate 0.8.
Cultures at the time of transfer from the SICU to the floor were showing no growth.
She had a head CT without contrast that showed air-fluid levels within the bilateral maxillary sinuses and right sphenoid and ethmoid air cells.
A sputum culture was obtained and is pending at the time of transfer to the floor.
She may also need an outpatient Holter monitor to actually better clearly define these runs of SVT.
PUMP:  Her digoxin was discontinued and she had a normal EF on the transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside hospital.
Her Foley was changed out and a repeat U/A and urine culture was sent.
On the day of transfer to the floor, a repeat U/A showed some white blood cells and some white blood cell clumps and thus she was started on levofloxacin.
An Infectious Disease workup ensued as the patient was afebrile; however, this was in the setting of IV steroids.
Thus, she underwent a head CT which revealed evidence of sinusitis and thus she was treated with Bactrim and Augmentin.
Her TSH was within normal limits.
