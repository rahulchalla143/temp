Sputum samples with no definitive microbiology, but rather moderate oropharyngeal flora, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued.
Respiratory viral panel as well as urine legionalla were negative, and BCx were with no growth to date.
Serial chest x-rays demonstrated rapid progression of right lower lobe consolidation from HD #1- HD #2, but no interval change following that time period.
On [**4-8**] a right pigtail catheter was placed in an attempt to drain the large effusion, CT scan showed significant loculations as well as a thick pleural rind, the decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for a formal decortication and drainge.
CXR were checked daily to evaluate for recurrence of effusion, pneumothorax as well as appropriate chest tube position.
Intra-operative cultures became positive for MRSA, Vancomycin and levaquin were continued as abx coverage.
On POD 4 patient noted some swelling in her right arm a venous duplex was performed to evaluate for DVT given her PICC line, the study was negative for thrombosis.
On POD 5 repeat CT scan was performed, showing; " Overall improvement.
On POD #6  repeat bronchoscopy was performed, this demonstrated improvement of edema in RML/RLL, with no evidence of obstruction.
At the time of discharge, pt pain was controlled with PO meds, she was ambulating without assistance, her oxygen saturations were in the high 90's on room air, her WBC had normalized, and she was tolerating a regular diet.
2) Asthma: Pt demonstrated no physical exam evidence of wheezing, suggestive against an acute asthma exacerbation.
Systemic steroids, which were given in ED, were not continued given known infection and no evidence of asthma exacerbation.
3) Sinus tachycardia: Heart rate 110 bpm at admission; most likely secondary to fever and pleuritic chest pain, as well as s/p albuterol nebulizers, both of which can produce tachycardia.
Heart rate only mildly elevated at admission, and improved with defervescence and improved respiratory function.
4) Normocytic anemia: Hct dropped to 32-34 during hospitalization, Hct 40 at admission.
