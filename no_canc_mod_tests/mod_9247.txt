The patient had blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures, CMV viral load sent on the [**9-13**].
The patient underwent an ultrasound on the 20 which demonstrated no flow in his hepatic artery.
The patient underwent a CAT scan that demonstrated a 4 x 5 x 4.7 cm collection consistent with a large biloma.
We followed him serial CAT scans on the 25 and again on the 31.
The patient's biliary cultures grew out gram-negative Staph.
Of note, his LFTs on admission revealed an AST and ALT of 47 and 55, and an alk phos of 228, and a total bilirubin 1.0, that slowly increased up to a bilirubin of 4.3 on [**10-4**], with transaminases of 39 and 48, and alk phos increased to 377.
The patient had significant lower extremity swelling, and had an IVC gram that showed a stenosis that was angioplastied on the [**10-8**].
The patient's vanc levels remained in a therapeutic range.
On [**10-10**], the patient received an offer for a cadaveric liver, and on [**10-10**] the patient underwent cadaveric renal transplantation.
It was an end-to-end anastomosis between the recipient splenic artery and the donor hepatic artery.
His bilirubin slowly increased postoperatively to a high of 22.6 on [**10-30**], which was postop day #19.
The patient had full investigations including tube cholangiograms which were normal, CT scanning with IV contrast which demonstrated a small wasting of the portal vein with good flow through the portal vein, and a small residual stenosis of IVC with good flow in the IVC.
The patient underwent a portal cavagram on the [**10-22**] which demonstrated a small wasting of the portal vein again with no gradient as well.
The patient had an IVC gram that showed no gradient across the IVC stenosis.
The patient had a mesenteric A gram that demonstrated the hepatic-splenic artery anastomosis to be intact with good flow and perfusion of the left and right hepatic arteries without evidence of stenosis.
The patient had a liver biopsy that was consistent with some ischemic changes of preservation injury, without evidence of rejection.
The patient had a repeat CT scan done on the [**9-27**] which showed a small collection in the lesser sac for which he had a percutaneous drain placed.
His hepatic graft and function returned, and he slowly increased his synthetic function, and over the ensuing weeks his bilirubin decreased from a maximum of 22.6 down to 3.5.
All of the patient's cultures were negative, and all of his antibiotics were completed.
The patient had a repeat CT scan done on the [**11-30**] which demonstrated nephrolithiasis on the right, and no kidney stones on the left, a decrease in ascites, a small collection associated with the pigtail catheter, and a small pancreatic pseudocyst.
The platelet count was stable at 40,000 at the time of discharge.
By the time of discharge on [**2173-12-3**], the patient was on hospital day #53, and the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 98.8.
Blood pressure was stable.
His labs as of the [**12-2**] revealed a creatinine which was stable at 1.2, AST and ALT 40 and 55, alk phos 286, and a bilirubin of 3.4.
The patient will have [**Hospital1 **]-weekly laboratory examinations for CBC including platelets to follow platelet count, a chem-10 or a renal to follow his creatinine and his blood chemistries, LFTs, and [**Hospital1 **]-weekly Prograf levels.
