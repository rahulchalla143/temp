It was postulated that pt's hypotension was secondary to severe fluid overload (5 liters positive on pod 1) and residual of anesthesia.
As mentioned above, he was ruled out for mi, had echo which was neg for tamponade and demonstrated unchanged lv function.
He also was cultured for potential sepsis although he remained afebrile - these cultures were negative.
Over the next several days, his blood pressure should be checked regularly and his beta blocker can be gently titrated for optimal bp control.
Based upon PA cath [**Location (un) 1131**] and overall fluid balance, pt felt to be in failure and thought to be etiology of hypotension.
His ACEi and Coreg were gently restarted for maximal bp control.
CXR showed no displacement of leads and still pacing on tele.
Afib: continued on coumadin and coumadin should be titrated for goal inr greater than 2.0.
