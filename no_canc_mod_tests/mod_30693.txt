Pt was initially put on Lovenox 70 [**Hospital1 **] with coumadin when PE's discovered on chest CT.  Pt was stable for 2 days and then had an acute episode of desaturation, O2 sats 83-84% on 4L, minimal improvement with nebs and 50% facemask.
Chest X-ray did not show any acute process, but patient was laboring to breathe, using accessory muscles, and was not moving air very well.
ABG showed some CO2 retention, a normal pH, but inadequate O2 sat given the amount of facemask O2.
TTE showed possible left mobile PA mass/clot; suggestion was patient was throwing new clots even though on Lovenox.
