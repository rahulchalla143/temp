CXR with equivocal findings for PNA, also febrile with increasing WBC though no left shift or leukocytosis at admission.
Some evidence of volume overload on exam with elevated JVP and bibasilar crackles, also with evidence on CXR, and SBP almost 200 at admission so may have had flash pulmonary edema.
At time of discharge, he was satting well on RA and his respiratory exam was normal.
Chest x-ray questionable for pneumonia.
Most likely represents respiratory acidosis with superimposed AG and non-AG metabolic acidosis vs primary metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation in the setting of chronically elevated pCO2 >50, though serum HCO3 22 in 2/[**2148**].
Creatinine improved and was nearing baseline at time of discharge.
Information was obtained from Patient.
Your chest x-ray showed a possible pneumonia, so you were treated with antibiotics.
Your lab tests showed that your kidneys suffered some damage, so you were given IV fluids and diuretics and your kidney function improved.
Amitriptyline - this medication was stopped 6.
