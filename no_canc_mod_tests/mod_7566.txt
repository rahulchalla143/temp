At that time, the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 33 and 3,000 units of factor VIII.
Hepatitis C. 4.
Human immunodeficiency virus, last CD4 count on [**5-17**] showed a viral load of 700.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival, the patient had a pulse of 90, blood pressure 140/palp, and was satting 97% on room air.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ARRIVAL:  White count of 9.2, hematocrit of 36.4, PT of 12.8, PTT of 34.7, INR of 1.1.
ALT of 30, AST 95, amylase 100, alkaline phosphatase 137, factor VIII 49%.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.2, chloride 108, bicarb 22, BUN 13, creatinine 0.4, and glucose 176.
CT of the abdomen showed increased fluid in the pelvis, spleen with an increase in size, and within the spleen, there was heterogeneity as well as air.
Chest x-ray was negative.
Pelvis x-ray was also negative.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL EVENTS:  After initial evaluation in the Emergency Department and initial films at Radiology, the patient was transferred to the Trauma SICU with plans for Hematology/Oncology followup, two hour hematocrit checks, and factor VIII treatment.
Although, this was felt to be a probable response from the splenic injury, the ID service was consulted for further evaluation of the fevers.
Multiple x-rays showed no major change in this area overtime.
Both Infectious Disease and Pulmonology agreed that a repeat abdominal CT and chest CT would be wise prior to bronch.
Results of the CT showed no splenic abscess and no change in the pleural effusion.
It was finally determined that the fevers were not due to an infectious source, and the patient was discharged with followup at the Trauma service, Chronic Pain service, and his PCP.
