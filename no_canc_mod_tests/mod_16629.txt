On presentation to ED, intitially (14:45) T 97.1, HR 35, BP 84/35, RR 18, O2 96% on RA.
Initial EKG demonstrated HR 44, no change from previous EKG from PCP office in [**2132-3-31**], read by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], demonstrated ectopic atrial rhythm at slow rate of 46 bpm (same p'-wave morphologies).
When HR 30, BP 94/56, pt c/o lightheadedness and was given atropine 0.5mg x 1 and Glucagon 5mg IV x 1 (at 16:32), HR increased to 61, BP 112/61.
Repeat EKGs essentially unchanged, HR ranging 36-54.
Past Medical History: --Cirrhosis (h/o ascites, h/o encephalopathy, esophageal varicies, spenomegaly) - Appointment with hepatology on [**2132-8-27**] --Seizures:  from EtOH withdrawl AND in [**3-4**] presented to [**Hospital1 2177**] with sz, thought to be [**1-2**] NARCOTIC (oxycontin/codone) withdrawl - represented next day s/p syncope and tox screen positive for cocaine - therefore thought sz [**1-2**] narcotic AND cocaine withdrawl.
PCP set up MRI for further w/u but patient did not show up at appointment.
--Guiac + stool in [**2129**] - s/p colonoscopy that showed incomplete exam due to poor prep.
Colonoscopy in [**2131-12-1**] that showed sessile polyp that was removed - path showed fragments of adenoma.
--Pancreatitis ([**1-2**] EtOH) --Left foot injury - pins placed - on oxycodone and oxycontin for pain control (Of note, when he stops taking, experiences withdrawl symptoms such as N/V, piloerection, diaphoresis) --HTN --Thrombocytopenia - thought likely [**1-2**] EtOH use, also noted to have hypersplenism.
