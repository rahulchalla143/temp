LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in critical but stable condition for further monitoring and recovery.
