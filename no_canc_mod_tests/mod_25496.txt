LUMBAR PUNCTURE: [**2132-10-28**] wbc=1 rbc=1 protein=15  glucose=94 .
Urine culture (from foley) one day prior to d/c notable for 50+ reds, 20-50 whites, trace leukesterase and negative nitrites   Brief Hospital Course: 42F with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreaitis developed hypotension and ARDS requiring intubation.
All cultures were negative, neither we nor the surgical team beleived that her pancreas had become infected.
Initially, pt had an APACHEII score 7, which corresponds to a predicted death rate of 7.6%.
Initially her CT showed large amount of peripancreatic stranding and fluid consistent acute pancreatitis and progressed to severe pancreatitis with concern for widespread necrosis involving the body and tail, extending into the neck within 48 hours.
She also required an insulin gtt to control her blood glucose.
Given persistent abdominal distension and worsening leukocytosis, a repeat CT was obtained which showed a possible abscess forming to the right of the uterus potentially communicating with peripancreatic fluid.
Over the next day, she became afebrile and her WBC count trended down from 35 to 25.
We were not worried about the question of abscess due to resolving fevers and return of leukocytosis from 35 to 25, however we have suggested daily abdominal examinations with repeat evaluation with imaging should she become acutely febrile or have any elevation in WBC or other inflammatory markers.
Initial intubation was [**10-12**].
Lumbar puncture was performed to rule out infection of her VP shunt: 1wbc, 1rbc, glucose of 90, and protein of 15.
Yeast grew from [**Last Name (un) 29828**] her sputum and urine; Beta-glucan was negative and fungal cultures were negative at the time of discharge.
A repeat abdominal CT showed development of small area of wall thickening near uterus communicative with peripancreatic fluid as above however our suspicion for intervention was low given that her WBC trended back down and remained afebrile.
C diff toxin X 2 was negative.
Urine lytes were c/w intra-renal etiology.
Magnesium and K repleted daily with K goal > 3.5.
