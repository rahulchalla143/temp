Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system.
Left ventriculography revealed a normal estimated ejection fraction.
Hemodynamic assessment revealed a moderately elevated left-sided filling pressure (LVEDP 25mmHg).
The right-sided filling pressures were moderately elevated (RA mean 14mmHg, PVEDP 17mmHg).
Final angiogrpahy demonstrated no residual stenosis, no apparent  dissection, and normal flow.
During the procedure his BP and HR were labile and he had an episode of Afib which resolved spontaneously.
A head CT obtained was negative for a bleed.
A CTA of his neck was also obtained b/c the pt continued to have CP post cath.
His symptoms resolved and he was initially kept in the CCU for observation.
Repeat echo post cath revealed the left atrium to be moderately dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
