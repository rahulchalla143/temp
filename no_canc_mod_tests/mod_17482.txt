In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.3, P 74, BP 151/64, R 24, O2 sat.
Exam notable for rales at right lung base.
Labs notable for normal WBC, anemia with HCT 30.9, hyperkalemia with K 5.5, and elevated BUN/Cr of 71/11.4.
EKG showed sinus rhythm with Q wave in III and TWI in III.
CXR demonstrated right-sided effusion.
Sats were dropping to mid 80s on 5L NC, and patient became responsive only to sternal rub, prompting a trigger for hypoxia and AMS.
Just prior to transfer, ABG showed 7.20/72/62/29.

Brief Hospital Course: This 45yo male with CHF, COPD, OSA, and ESRD on HD MWF, who presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia in the setting of recent cocaine use, with CXR demonstrating right sided effusion.
ACS was felt to be unlikely etiology of dyspnea and acute hypoxia, in absence of chest pain, EKG w/o evidence of ischemia, and flat cardiac enzymes.
Patient's sats improved on non-rebreather, and he became more awake and alert.
CT chest demonstrated loculated right pleural effusion, concerning for parapneumonic effusion and possible empyema in setting of multifocal PNA.
Thoracentesis on [**2148-2-8**] yielded ~1L of serosanguionous fluid, which was sent for cell count, gram stain, culture and cytology.
EKG did not demonstrate any evidence of ischemia to suggest acute worsening of CHF secondary to an ischemic event.
CT showed evidence of renal osteodystrophy.
