A repeat image obtained in full inspiration is recommended when the condition of the patient permits.
Her first debridement revealed a relatively small abscess cavity which was copiously irrigated and evacuated.
An aggressive debridement was undertaken and a sponge was packed in the abscess.
At this time very little necrotic tissue was discovered and a wound vac was placed.
Her white blood cell count remained in the high teens but she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Her blood sugars remained very difficult to control so she was begun on an insulin drip.
Cultures from the wound early in her course showed heavy polymicrobial growth on gram stain and cultures showed heavy growth of STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS.MODERATE GROWTH STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
Her vancomycin troughs were closely monitored and she did have mild renal insufficiency with an elevated creatinine to 2.2.
Her white blood cell count stabilized and her clindamycin was discontinued on [**8-30**].
Recommendations for insulin dosing was reviewed and she maintained her blood sugars within an acceptable range.
[**Name (NI) **] vital signs are stable and she is afebrile.
Her white blood cell count is 10.5 and her creatinine is 1.7.
Of note her blood pressure is in good range off her Enalapril and she will remain off for now.
Her creatine will be checked on [**2139-9-15**] and her blood pressure will also be monitored by the VNA.
