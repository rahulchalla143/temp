CXR [**2117-8-29**] As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
The small retrosternal air collection documented on a CT from [**8-28**] is, with knowledge of this CT, visible on the lateral chest film.
Chest tubes d/ced by IP yesterday, some concern for small residual PTX on the right but recent CXR demonstrate no concerning PTX at this time.
Both of these processes could likely have caused her presentation and it is unclear if her PE could have set off an acute asthma exerbation or if her PE is subclinical.
There is a possibility that the clot was bigger at one point and perhaps after 8 min of CPR, clot was dislodged and traveled more distally.
Transitional Issues: Patient will need to have INR checked at PCP's office for initiation of Coumadin.
Outpatient Lab Work Please obtain INR on [**2117-8-30**] and fax to PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **],[**Name9 (PRE) 18356**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21473**] Fax: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 90804**].
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] medication requires frequent follow up and blood tests to make sure that you have the correct blood level.
You will need to go to your PCP's office in the next 2-3 days to obtain an INR check, the blood test to check the levels of coumadin in your body.
