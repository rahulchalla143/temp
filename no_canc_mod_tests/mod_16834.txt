Exploratory Laparotomy with diverting ileostomy 3.
Abdominal exam reveals no masses, tenderness, ascites.
Pt transferred to SICU, intubated, and taken to OR for exploratory laparotomy and diverting ileostomy; primary incision left open due to abdominal compartment syndrome.
Upon transfer to SICU, patient started on levophed and pitressor to maintain blood pressures.
Gradually weaned off thsee drips with appropriate recovery of blood pressure, pt essentially normotensive by [**5-31**].
Although pt denied any orthostatic symptoms, he would have HRs of 80-90 at rest, and 160-170 upon standing or walking.
In SICU pt noted to have bizarre electrolyte abnormalities, including sodiums up to 160, with concomitant concentrated urine.
However, late in hospital course as it appeared that pt was unable to concentrate urine despite net fluid loss, a more intensive renal workup was pursued.
On the floor, pt gradually began having good flow from his ostomy, and in fact output became so high he was started on significant doses of loperamide, as his ostomy output was felt to be contributing to his general hypovolemia.
