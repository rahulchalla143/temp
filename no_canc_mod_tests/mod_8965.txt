GI Bleed: In the emergency department, she was hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 20 and .
Her INR was reversed with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.  A nasogastric lavage was negative.
A central line was placed, and she was started on dopamine for blood pressure support.
She later underwent an upper endoscopy that showed gastritis without any obvious bleeding source.
Her aspirin, plavix, and coumadin were held in the setting of her bleed.
Her hematocrit was stable at 28 for several days.
At the time of discharge, her hematocrit was 29.3.
It was recommended to have an outpatient colonoscopy to complete her evaluation.
A chest x-ray demonstarted fluid overload from her aggressive fluid ressucitation.
Serial cardiac enzymes remained negative.
As she was not a candidate for further intervention, she was treated with medical management.
Her metoprolol, lisinopril, and digoxin were held given bradycardia and renal dysfunction.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20% and was unchanged from prior studies with the exception of increased pericardial effusion (pulsus was 8).
Prior to discharge, her metoprolol, lisinopril, digoxin, and lasix were restarted.
Acute on chronic renal failure: Her creatinine was elevated above her baseline of 1.6-1.9 on admission.
