Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated an LMCA free of angiographically significant disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated systemic arterial pressures.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg) and Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the CCU following her cardiac catheterization for a circumflex artery ST elevation MI.
Despite a massive CK and troponin elevation, she was hemodynamically stable.
An echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction between 30% to 35%.
The patient could likely do with a repeat echocardiogram in 6 weeks.
There was some concern on an OSH chest X-ray for a pneumonia, but she was not initiated on antibiotic therapy as clinically she did not appear to have a pneumonia.

Please ensure that your INR and kidney function are checked when you see your primary care physician on [**Location (un) **].
He may want to get a repeat ECHOcardiogram in 6 weeks to determine how well your heart is functioning.
