Compared to the previous tracing of [**2113-8-19**] the findings are similar.
[**2113-8-24**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-22**], apical hypokinesis of the left and right ventricle is now seen.
[**2113-8-24**] CXR: In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is little change.
Multiple monitoring and support devices remain in place with no definite pneumothorax.
[**2113-8-24**] CXR: In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is little change.
Multiple monitoring and support devices remain in place with no definite pneumothorax.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2113-8-23**] no change except supraventricular premature beats are more frequent.
[**2113-8-25**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**8-24**], there is little overall change in the appearance of the extensive bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
[**2113-8-26**] CXR: Compared to the study from the prior day, there is no significant interval change.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2113-8-25**] atrial fibrillation has appeared.
[**2113-8-28**] CXR: In combination with findings of the CT of [**2113-8-19**], the observed lung abnormalties probably represent a combination of pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia.
[**2113-8-28**] CXR: Following removal of right-sided chest tube, there is no visible right pneumothorax and no substantial change in a moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
Many groups of bronchial epithelial cells, some with crowding and prominent nucleoli, favor reactive; pulmonary macrophages, neutrophils, and some squamous cells.
Comparison is made with prior study performed 4 hours earlier.
Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right are unchanged, could be due to atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.
[**2113-9-2**] CT chest/abd/pelvis : Moderate-to-large layering L pleural effusion, worsened with loculations in superior posterior portion.
Multiple wedge perfusion anomalies of the kidneys, likely renal infarcts.
[**2113-9-4**] CXR : Worsening B pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.
[**2113-9-5**] CXR : Unchanged extensive R lung opacities associated with pleural effusion.
Otherwise, unchanged exam from two days prior.
Recommendation was made to repeat study after removal of overlying external device on left upper chest.
In combination with findings from CT torso [**2112-9-2**], this is concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
