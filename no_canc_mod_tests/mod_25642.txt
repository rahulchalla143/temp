Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with PMH CAD s/p LAD and RCA stents, MI x 3, DMII, HTN, PAD presenting with CP x2 nights, seen at OSH and treated as NSTEMI and depressed EF (30-35% to 15-20%) with unchanged coronary disease and significant abdominal pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Even though her cardiac enzymes were elevated, it seems unlikely to be an acute ischemic cardiomyopathy, given that her most recent catheterization findings were unchanged from those of previous catheterizations.
She underwent a myocardial viability study using cardiac MR, showing findings consistent with low likelihood of functional recovery in the anterior and septal walls and distal inferior wall after mechanical revascularization.
She was discharged on a Lovenox bridge for continued warfarin therapy (which she should continue indefinitely for history of a parietal stroke), with INR checks by her PCP.
Her pain was controlled with narcotics and eased down to her baseline abdominal pain, which she has had for a few years.
H. pylori serologies were negative and CT abomen/pelvis was unremarkable for abscess or occult infection.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on Saturday [**4-18**] with results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],KIAME J.
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 63099**] 6. metformin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
A cardiac catheterization was done there and you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to evaluate your heart arteries and decide on a plan for treatment.
You had a cardiac MRI which showed that there are areas of your heart that would not benefit from a bypass operation.
All of the tests that we performed did not show a cause for the abdominal pain.
You should have a colonoscopy done soon to evaluate your [**Last Name (STitle) 499**] for any problems.
Start taking Lovenox once a day to prevent blood clots until your INR is more than 2 and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66153**] tells you to stop.
Stop simvastatin because your liver tests are high, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66153**] will restart this medicine again  Followup Instructions: Name: [**Last Name (STitle) **],KIAME J Address: [**Location (un) **], [**Hospital1 **],[**Numeric Identifier 66038**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 63099**] Appt: [**4-22**] at 3:40pm  Name: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] B.
