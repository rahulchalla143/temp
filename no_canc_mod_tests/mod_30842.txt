In addition, during that hospitalization, the was noted to have a systolic blood pressure in the 85-110 range and all of his antihypertension medications were discontinued.
On [**2116-3-6**], VNA found the patient supine, blood pressure 100/60, sitting blood pressure 60/40, and standing blood pressure 40/palpable.
His initial examination was notable for brown, guaiac negative stool, but several hours later, he had sudden, explosive episodes of melena.
The patient then had a nasogastric lavage done, which was clear.
A GI consultation was obtained and evaluated the patient and initially, an upper endoscopy was planned.
A type and cross was sent.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature was 98.8, heart rate 108, blood pressure 91/58, respiratory rate 60, O2 saturation 98% on room air.
EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99, left ventricular hypertrophy, normal intervals, no acute ST and T wave changes.
The EKG was compared with [**2115-11-23**].
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cells was 12.6, hematocrit 27.4, platelet count 211, MCV 95, sodium 141, potassium 5.7 (slightly hemolyzed), chloride 109, bicarbonate 25, BUN 49, creatinine 1.1, glucose 106, PT 14.2, PTT 31.5, INR 1.3.
IMPRESSION:  An 82-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident and dehydration who was noted to have orthostatic hypotension (standing blood pressure 40/palpable), when VNA visited him.
His initial examination was notable for negative guaiac and brown stool.
However, a repeat OGT lavage was done which revealed again, no bright red blood, and brown-tinged fluid, which cleared with lavage.
The patient's hematocrit was checked q.
8 hours while in the medical intensive care unit, and his hematocrit was stable after transfusion of another unit of packed red cells (for a total of six units) in the medical intensive care unit.
The question of an emergent/urgent endoscopy was approached again with GI and since the patient was hemodynamically stable, and his nasogastric lavage was negative, in the setting of a new large pneumothorax, and without obvious life-threatening active hemorrhage, GI deferred on endoscopy until the patient was more medically stable.
Even though the patient had melena, his hematocrit was checked initially q.
12 hours on the floor and his hematocrit remained stable x 4 days.
Given that the patient's hematocrit remained stable, there did not appear to be any active blood loss.
A cold forceps biopsy was performed for histology.
In addition, the patient will be scheduled to have a repeat endoscopy in eight weeks to document ulcer healing and for possible repeat biopsy to exclude malignancy.
His hematocrit was checked q.
The patient's pneumothorax was moderate to large sized and cardiothoracic surgery was called to place a chest tube.
Initially, the chest tube had air leaks, which later resolved.
The thoracic service continued to follow the chest tube throughout his admission and repeat chest x-rays were obtained to evaluate the progression/resolution of it.
On [**2116-3-10**], cardiothoracic surgery pulled the chest tube, and a repeat chest x-ray obtained showed that the pneumothorax was slightly smaller in size.
The patient was stable on room air and had O2 saturations of 95-99%.
The patient had a type and screen sent every three days, and always had three units of packed red cells ready/reserved for this patient.
This was likely secondary to an expansion acidosis, given his aggressive IV fluid hydration with normal saline.
Over the next three to four days on the floor, his bicarbonate slowly increased to 20, and his chloride decreased to 110.
Pneumoboots were not placed on this patient, secondary to them being too painful to his lower extremities.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was given fluid resuscitation with normal saline at 150 cc/hour in the medical intensive care unit, which was changed to lactated Ringer solution at 125 cc/hour on the floor.
and as it seemed that his GI bleeding had resolved, and hematocrit was stable, he was transitioned to sips of clears.
After his esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed a healing ulcer, he was transitioned to clears, to full liquids, and is now tolerating a regular diet well.
Strict I's and O's were kept on this patient, which included his rectal tube, chest tube, intravenous fluids, and urine output.
Urine output was good and there were no problems with the discontinuation of his Foley catheter.
The patient continued to have melena, have his hematocrit was stable and it is likely that his melena will continue for a while.
DISPOSITION:  The patient is status post EGD x 1 day and doing well.
His hematocrit is stable.
The patient will follow up with GI for a repeat EGD in eight weeks to document ulcer healing, and possible repeat biopsy to exclude malignancy.
The patient should had a hematocrit checked twice a week.
If there is evidence of decreasing hematocrit (patient's hematocrit is currently stable at the 29-31% range) to less than 26-27%, recommend investigation.
HOWEVER, ON THE DAY OF DISCHARGE, AS WELL AS THE DAY BEFORE DISCHARGE, THE PATIENT'S CREATININE WAS 0.9 TO 1.0, WITH A BUN OF 16 TO 20.
