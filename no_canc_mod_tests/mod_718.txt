The patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a positive troponin level of 2.87 and a creatine kinase of 426.
Cardiac catheterization performed on the day prior to admission at [**Hospital **] Hospital demonstrated a small LIMA, total occlusion of the SVG to OM,  and diseased segments of the SVG to diagonal to obtuse marginal.
The LV end-diastolic pressure was 19, right atrial pressure was 13, and pulmonary artery pressure 33/10.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed his blood pressure was 100 to 110/60, his heart rate was 40 to 50 (without ectopy), and he was saturating 100 percent on room air.
The lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 7.2, his hematocrit was 40.7, and his platelets were 187.
His blood urea nitrogen was 20 and his creatinine was 1.1.
Cholesterol was 154, his high-density lipoprotein was 30, and his low-density lipoprotein was 90.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia with a rate in the 50s.
Then the patient dropped his blood pressure significantly in the SVG to first diagonal to first obtuse marginal jump graft  90's with prominent ST depressions in V1, two hepicoat stents mid and distally, one cypher in the ostium.
Post procedure, the patient developed recurrent angina with more prominent ST depressions in V1 through V4, ST elevations in I and aVL, with a decrease in blood pressures to systolics in the 90s when the nitroglycerin drip was increased.
An intraaortic balloon pump was placed to maximize coronary blood flow.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS-FOLLOWUP: 1.
The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (his    cardiologist) who will arrange for signal-averaged EKG and    exercise T wave alternate study.
