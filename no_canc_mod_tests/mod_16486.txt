An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST changes.
Subsequently he was noted to have a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 4.9, creatinine kinase 867.
He had a cardiac catheterization on [**12-17**] showing three vessel disease with proximal lesions of the left anterior descending, left circumflex and right coronary artery with a global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of approximately 30%.
Prior to the coronary artery bypass graft the patient also developed a fever which was thought to be due to a urinary tract infection as well as a pneumonia and urine growing greater than 100,000 Escherichia coli.
Chest x-ray showed a right middle lobe infiltrate.
At [**Hospital6 256**] the patient presented with a low-grade fever, still slight leukocytosis and hypoxia to 83% on room air, improving to 96% on 4 liters.
Urinary tract infection; 6.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on transfer to Medicine Service were 99.6 temperature maximum, temperature currently was 98.2, blood pressure 104 to 120/60 to 70, and last at 110/60, heartrate ranging 65 to 76, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturations 96% on 4 liters.
On examination this is a well-appearing although slightly pale elderly male in no acute distress.
His pulses were equal bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On laboratory data significant was a white blood cell count of 12.3.
Chemistry panel was notable for a BUN of 42 and a creatinine of 2.4.
The patient's baseline creatinine was approximately 1.1, on transfer was 24 for BUN and 1.8 for creatinine.
His urinalysis was negative for any evidence of urinary tract infection.
Liver function tests had a slight increase of ALT to 105 and AST at 61.
His creatinine kinase was 53, his troponin T was 4.47.
Chest x-ray was done which showed evidence of congestive heart failure with bilateral effusions and increased vascularity and evidence of pulmonary edema.
On a repeat urinalysis it did show 21 to 50 red blood cells but negative for urinary tract infection and urine cultures were negative.
Blood cultures times two were also negative.
Sputum culture was not able to be done as the patient was not producing any sputum.
The hypoxia subsequently resolved and at the time of transfer for his coronary artery bypass graft the patient had an oxygen saturation of 93 to 94% on room air.
His congestive heart failure did improve clinically throughout his hospital stay prior to his coronary artery bypass graft.
The acute tubular necrosis was resolving with stabilized creatinine of approximately 2.3.
For continued workup of this Renal Team is recommending outpatient nephrology follow up for this patient.
