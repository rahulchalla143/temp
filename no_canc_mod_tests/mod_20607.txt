Previous evaluation by echocardiogram at an outside hospital revealed worsening of her aortic valve stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
On[**Last Name (STitle) 53680**]ate of admission, a TEE was performed which showed an aortic valve area of 0.8 as well as no evidence of mitral valve regurgitation.
A valvuloplasty was considered as a diagnostic tool and the surgery was postponed.
CHF with an ejection fraction of 35%.
Calcium carbonate.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile with a blood pressure of 118/67, heart rate 77, respiratory rate of 20, oxygen saturation 99% on face mask following extubation.
The physical examination is notable for labored breathing but no accessory muscle use.
At that time, she was found to have an aortic valve area of 0.9 with a cardiac index of 3.1 and a peak gradient of 31.
In the interim since her discharge, the patient had an outpatient echocardiogram at an outside hospital.
At that time, it was felt that her aortic valve area had worsened to 0.6 and that there was also evidence of mitral valve regurgitation.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed prior to the procedure.
It showed an aortic valve area of 0.8 and no evidence of mitral valve regurgitation.
On the following day, the patient was taken to cardiac catheterization for repeat evaulation and standby valvuloplasty.
She was found to have a cardiac output of 5.14 and a cardiac index of 3.61.
Her aortic valve area was measured at 0.8 with an area index of 0.53.
The aortic valve gradient was 43.14.
Of note, an echocardiogram done on the day of cardiac catheterization showed [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] initially of 0.4 cm.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 38%.
Her systolic blood pressures remained stable in the low 100s.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36953**] had performed a thorough pulmonary workup in the past including PFTs and chest CT.
During the hospitalization, pulmonary function tests were obtained which revealed a FEV1 of 540 cc (41% predicted), an FVC of 0.98 liters (47% predicted), and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 86% predicted.
Her lung volumes were also decreased.
A chest CT was obtained which showed mild emphysematous changes but no evidence of interstitial disease or bronchiectasis.
However, they were not able to offer any therapy for her chest wall deformity.
Pulmonary consult recommended repeating a CT to follow the ground glass opacity seen in the right upper lobe.
They also recommended an outpatient speech and swallow evaluation to rule out aspiration given the patient's history of esophageal dilation.
A femoral vascular ultrasound was performed which showed an AV fistula but no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
Following discussion with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Vascular Surgery, it was decided to make a follow-up appointment with him as well as a follow-up femoral ultrasound study in three to four weeks following discharge.
Saturating 98% on room air and ambulating with a walker.
An outpatient femoral ultrasound study to evaluate the AV fistula on Friday, [**2167-1-23**], at 10:30 a.m.
