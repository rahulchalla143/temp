LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler could not be assess due to absence of apical windows, but there appears to be atrial mechanical function on M-mode of the mitral leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
