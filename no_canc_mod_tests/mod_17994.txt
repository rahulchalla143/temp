BNP was noted to be elevated at 1000, and there was some concern for dietary indiscretion during a recent trip.
Given that she was scheduled to have and AICD generator change at [**Hospital1 18**] in the next few weeks, her cardiologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Of note, imaging performed after the patient's head strike was significant for anterior C4 fracture of unclear chronicity.
VS at the time of transfer were HR 80s - 100s with SBP 100s - 110s.

OSH CXR - Cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion (per d/c summary) .
OSH Cervical Xray - Limited exam, not visualizing C7.
OSH CT Head and C-Spine - No acute intracranial finding.
[**2145-12-4**] CXR - Left dual-lead pacemaker has its leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle respectively.
There is worsening indistinctness of the perihilar and pulmonary vasculature which is suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema.

She had no significant electrolyte abnormalities noted (K was 3.5 the morning of admission to the outside hospital and her magnesium was reassuring).
Her electrolytes were optimized with a magnesium of greater than 2.0 and potassium greater than 4.0 to 4.5.
She was maintained on telemtry and had serial EKG monitoring.
On admission, she denied any chest pain and her EKG was without ischemic changes.
# DYSPNEA ON EXERTION - The patient has a known history of non-ischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LVEF of [**5-11**]%.
On admission to the CCU, her exam still was notable for bibasilar crackles, a CXR showing mild fluid overload.
Of note, the patient also has history of asthma and was recently on a steroid taper; however, her exam did not reveal any wheezing or evidence of asthma exacerbation.
# NAUSEA & DIARRHEA - An infectious process vs. medication effect from her Doxycycline is the most likely etiology.
A C.diff was negative at the outside hospital; while her other stool cultures were pending.
# C-SPINE FRACTURE ON C-SPINE IMAGING - The patient presented with a syncope episode that resulted in a presumed head injury and CT head with C-spine imaging showed evidence of a C4-fracture of unknown chronicity.
On exam in the CCU at [**Hospital1 18**], she had no evidence of neurologic compromise.
