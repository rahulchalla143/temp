History of Present Illness: Pt is a 74 yo man with h/o stroke in [**2186**] on warfarin, recent TIA in [**5-1**], a. fib, HTN, and dyslipidemia who presents for scheduled cardiac catheterization for further assessment of aortic stenosis.
Pt reports he was recently diagnosed by echocardiogram in [**7-1**].
He also denied HA, cough, hemoptysis, N/V/D, abdominal pain, melena, or BRBPR, and recent fevers or chills.
Physical Exam: VS - P76, BP165/68, R18, 97% RA Gen: older male in NAD.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: [**2200-7-28**] 05:17PM   PT-15.2* PTT-30.0 INR(PT)-1.4* [**2200-7-28**] 05:17PM   PLT COUNT-147* [**2200-7-28**] 05:17PM   WBC-8.3 RBC-5.16 HGB-14.7 HCT-42.5 MCV-82 MCH-28.5 MCHC-34.7 RDW-16.2* [**2200-7-28**] 05:17PM   GLUCOSE-92 UREA N-14 CREAT-1.3* SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-100 TOTAL CO2-31 ANION GAP-13  [**2200-7-29**] Cardiac Cath 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed moderate two vessel coronary artery disease with slow perfusion consistent with microvascular dysfunction.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 21-23 mmHg.
The cardiac index was depressed at 1.1 L/min/m2 with modest augmentation of cardiac output with dobutamine to 15 mcg/kg/min (with minimal change in heart rate and only mild increase in systemic systolic arterial pressure), based on a measured oxygen consumption post-sedation.
The SVR and PVR were  elevated at 3994 and 222 dynes-sec/cm5.
The mean aortic valve gradient was 42 mm Hg at rest with a calculated aortic valve area of 0.5 cm2  WIth dobutamine infusion at 15 mcg/kg/min, the gradient rose to 56 mm Hg, with calculated valve area of 0.5 cm2.
Left ventriculography showed a moderate-severely calcified aortic valve, mild (1+) non-ectopic mitral regurgitation, and normal wall motion with estimated ejection fraction of 60%.
[**2200-7-30**] Carotid Study There is a less than 40% right ICA stenosis and less than 40% left ICA stenosis with antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
[**2200-8-10**] CT Scan 1.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization in preparation for surgery which showed mild two vessel coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, mild pulmonary hypertension and a normal left ventricular function.
A head CT scan showed a moderate degree of small vessel ischemic changes and scattered lacunes.
Ceftriaxone was started for possible aspiration pneumonia however his chest x-rays remained normal.
His output eventually decreased and his NG tube was removed on postoperative day 6.
Laboratory studies were consistent with pancreatitis and TPN was started for nutrition.
A CT scan was performed which showed stranding seen adjacent to the pancreas tail which was consistent with mild uncomplicated pancreatitis however no evidence of pseudocyst formation or other sequelae of pancreatitis was identified.
On [**2200-8-7**], he transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
Slowly Mr. [**Known lastname 50840**] lipase and amylase trended back towards normal.
