CXR ([**2192-1-30**]) FINDINGS: Semi-upright portable AP views of the chest are obtained.
TTE ([**2192-1-31**]) The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
His exam (cardiac wheeze, pulmonary edema) indicates a predominantly left sided failure.
Repeat TTE showed low normal EF (LVEF 50%).
EKG was unremarkable, cardiac enzyme was flat.
LA was 5 cm in [**2184**].
Repeat TTE showed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] axis dimension 5.3 cm, and four chamber length of 6.8 cm.
Patient's CHADS2 score is 3, so he should be anticoagulated with coumadin.
Patient's blood pressure was well-controlled on the regimen.
LFT showed mildly elevated ALT: 58 and AST: 63, Alk phos and bilirubin were within normal range.
----------------- -------------- --------- MAJOR ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED 1) Anticoagulation - patient scores a 3 by CHADS2.
2) Dietary Indiscretion - reinforce healthy diet, review low/high salt foods for repetition 3) Hypertension and Rate control - we made changes to these meds (metoprolol, lisinopril) and restarted digoxin.
He was under considerably better control by discharge but this must be reasessed --------- ------------- ----------------  Medications on Admission: Metformin 1000 [**Hospital1 **] Risperdal 3 [**Hospital1 **] Metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] Furosemide 80 qAM Digoxin .125, not taking  Discharge Medications: 1.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check chem-7 on Monday [**2-6**] and call results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25288**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 83873**] Hypertension 2.
