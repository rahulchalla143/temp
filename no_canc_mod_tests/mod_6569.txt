Blood cx: negative Urine Legionella ag: negative .
CXR FINDINGS: The heart size is markedly enlarged, with unchanged configuration, but increased size in comparison to the previous film.
On the previous chest radiograph, right middle lobe opacity has been demonstrated, suggesting the chronic nature of this process.
bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma) cannot be excluded given previous CXR abnormality, and follow-up radiographs after completion of antibiotic therapy are necessary to ensure resolution.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
CXR showed right middle lobe and right lower lobe infiltrate.
Cardiology was consulted given a concern for pericardial effusion which by bedside ECHO appeared to be present but was not causing tamponade.
Urine legionella antigen was sent and was negative.
Sputum culture was sent but was nondiagnostic.
A subsequent formal ECHO in the ICU showed no evidence of pericardial effusion but an EF < 20% with 2+MR, 2+TR, and restrictive LV inflow pattern with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension and pulmonic regurgitation.
He continued to diurese on the floor with stable creatinine and was ultimately weaned off all supplemental oxygen.
Patient refused bronchoscopy, NG lavage, and rectal in the ICU.
His hematocrit remained stable on his home ASA and plavix without transfusion.
His labs are remarkable for a new thrombocytopenia.
Coags remarkable for a slightly elevated INR (1.4) for which he received po vitamin K.  He will follow-up with his primary care doctor for a chest CT following the resolution of his pneumonia to assess for pulmonary malignancy.
# Anemia: Hematocrit stable x 72 hours prior to discharge.
Iron studies, folate, B12 normal.
Repeat TSH and free T4 were normal.
# CAD: Patient had a troponin leak (peak 0.31) in the setting of CHF with creatinine 1.5.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day).
Outpatient Lab Work Sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, creatinine To be drawn on the day of your doctor's appointment 14.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: multilobar pneumonia Secondary: CHF exacerbation, thrombocytopenia, anemia   Discharge Condition: good - 95% on room air, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you experience shortness of breath, swelling in your legs, difficulties breathing lying down, temperature > 101, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, or other concerning symptoms.
