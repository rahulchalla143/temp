# Hyponatremia: Patient was admitted to the ICU with a sodium of 112.
Initial sodium deficit of 15mEq, so hypertonic saline was started at 28cc/hr.
Her sodium persisted to be 115 despite being at 46cc/hr, so that rate was continued with plan for correction of 8-12mEq over 24 hours.
Soidum was checked frequently.
Sodium was 126 on time morning of transfer out of ICU on [**1-19**].
Her orthostasis resolved and renal recommended fluid restriction.
She will need a repeat sodium as an outpt, this is scheduled for later this week, with follow-up with pcp.
# Pneumonia: While initial x-ray suggested a cavitary lung lesion, this was not apparent on CT chest.
A PPD had been placed on [**1-18**] and a sputum ctx was ordered, although the patient was unable to produce a sample for analysis.
She will need repeat CXR at 6 weeks post-abx in order to ensure resolution of consolidation.
CT head and neck negative for acute process.
Need to follow inr closely on levofloxacin given drug interaction.
TSH checked and within normal range at 1.6.
