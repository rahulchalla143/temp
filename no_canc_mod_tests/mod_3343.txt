Her initial examination there was only significant for right calf tenderness.
Bilateral lower extremity Dopplers were obtained but were poor studies.
The etiology of her rhabdomyolysis was presumed secondary to either her Mevacor or her hypothyroidism, which was under-treated secondary to non-compliance with her thyroid replacement.
Biopsy in [**2171-4-16**], revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma ER and PR positive, HER-2 negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon transfer to the Floor, vital signs with temperature of 97.4 F.; heart rate 70; blood pressure 160/70; respirations 18; 100% on two liters nasal cannula.
Abdomen:  Difficult examination secondary to obesity.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 13.7, hematocrit 32, platelets 246.
INR 1.1; PTT 32.6.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.4, chloride 97, bicarbonate 25, BUN 48, creatinine 6.4, glucose 143.
CK was 3400.
Musculoskeletal:  The patient's rhabdomyolysis was blamed on either her medication Mevacor, or on her hypothyroidism which was under-treated due to non-compliance with medication.
Her CK peaked in the 20,000 but then trended down.
She underwent fasciotomies on [**3-17**], with medial and lateral fasciotomies bilaterally.
She was started on heparin because deep vein thromboses could not be ruled out and were on the differential for etiologies for her compartment syndrome.
She was not scoped during this hospitalization, but will likely need gastrointestinal outpatient work-up for this.
