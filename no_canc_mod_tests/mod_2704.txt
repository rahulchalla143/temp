EKG initially RBBB w/ non specific ST T wave changes w/ NSR at 62.
CXR showed some bilateral patchy infiltrate.
AN LP was attempted in the ED for concern of disseminated zoster.
He was sats 98 % on Ra and BP 98/43 and afebrile.
Bld cx was drawn and these have remained negative.
Central line was inserted and CVP was 16 w/ BNP 1020.
Frothy pinkish secretions were obtained from his ETT tubes.
Cultures were sent.
CAD- s/p CABG x 3 in [**2158**] at [**Hospital1 112**], last cath [**6-28**] with 80% stenosis in SVG to OM1 s/p stent placement 2.
DM- HgA1C 6.4 in [**4-29**]; c/b nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy 5.

Pt did have bandemia at OSH on arrival, but numerous cultures on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] and at OSH negative including blood, sputum, BAL, urine, and foot wounds (left and right) were negative.
Pt gradually improved, tolerating trial of high flow face mask ventilation, with O2 sats 95-100% on 8-15LPM.
His secretions were improving on [**9-22**], and less copious.
Blood and sputum cultures, though initially negative [**Hospital1 18**] (pt previously on vanco/zosyn from OSH for unclear indication, abx d/c'd [**9-14**]), subseqeuntly were positive for MRSA in blood and sputum on [**9-17**].
Blood Cx subsequently +mrsa.
This admission pt with cardiac enzymes x 3 w/ + trop but negative CKs and these trended down.
On [**9-24**] pt complained of CP, however no new EKG changes were noted, cardiac enzymes unremarkable compared to prior bump, and CP resolved within <5 min.
b) pump-last ECHO showed decreased EF from [**4-29**] w/ 1+ MR and AS, now with EF 30-40% and mod-severe AS-attempting diuresis with diamox and lasix although on this hospitlization, diureses was complicated by pt's preload dependence.
# DM2 with complications - pt initially treated with insulin gtt which was weaned and transitioned to sliding scale coverage with good fsbs.
Iron studies demonstrate ACD [**12-26**] likely [**12-26**] DM, CHF.
# FEN: s/p extubation pt, evaluation of pt's swallow was attempted, however he was requiring long periods of CPAP which made this difficult.
