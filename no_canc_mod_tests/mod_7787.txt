TECHNIQUE: A multidetector scanner was used to obtain contiguous axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
Neither IV nor oral contrast were used.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater the left; there is compressive atelectasis at the left lung base.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: As previously noted, there is a small amount of free fluid surrounding the right colon, tracking along the mesentery and into the pelvis.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
