This was found because when his left arm/leg were lifted up and released, they dropped, whereas on the right he was able to keep them up for a little bit.
Notably, had leukocytosis with WBC 15 as well as chest x-ray consistent with pneumonia.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as it was not possible to place patient on EEG monitoring at OSH.

Neuro: The patient was monitored on continuous EEG while in the ICU.
This raised our concern for HSV encephalitis so he was started empirically on acyclovir and an LP was done.
The LP showed only 2 WBCs and 3 RBCs, 5 bands, protein 43 and glucose 112.
The PLEDs may be arising from a recent infarct but given the fact that the patient had a pacer an MRI could not be obtained.
His EEG initially showed intermittent R-sided PLEDs.
His EEG improved and showed fewer and less severe discharges than before.
A head CT showed no acute injury, wrist and hip x-rays showed no fractures.
The HSV PCR was negative, as was the CSF culture.
He also had a chest xray that was concerning for pneumonia so he was started on cefepime and vancomycin.
This was stopped after 2 days because the patient's chest xray improved after diuresis and he had no further white count or fever.
His blood pressure and electrolytes were stable and he did not require stress dose steroids.

Your EEG showed abnormal brain activity indicating a high likelihood of further seizures.
Another seizure medicine, Lacosamide, was added and the dose titrated up.
