AP CHEST FROM 11:09 P.M. [**6-2**]  HISTORY: End-stage renal disease and respiratory distress.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 3:00 and 4:30 p.m. today:  With the chin down, the tip of the endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles at least 5 cm from the carina, 2-3 cm above optimal placement.
Comparison is made with prior study performed the day before.
UNILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, basilic, brachial, and cephalic veins and the left subclavian vein.
They concurred with surgeon's evaluation that patient had become hypercarbic and tachypnic during OR and thought the angioedema was most likely to drug allergic reaction secondary to no pulmonary edema on CXR.
These medications were discontinued and patient improved mentally after several doses of flumazenil and narcan; however, patient was transferred to T/SICU for HD and observation on [**2172-6-4**].
