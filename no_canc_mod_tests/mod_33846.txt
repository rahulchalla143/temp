LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
There is no atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler but with provocative manuevers and contrast, a patent foramen ovale can be seen.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately to severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %).
A Valsalva manuever could not be performed due to concerns with lung hyperinflation and the LIMA positioning.
No other changes from pre-bypass study are noted.
