She was found to be anemic with Hct 25 and got 1 pRBC transfusion.
Her Hct was 27.
WBC was 8.1.
Troponin was found to be positive at that time with EKG changes in STD in anterolateral leads.
- GU: + foley, clear pale yellow urine - Ext: No cyanosis, clubbing.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
OTHER TESTING: - [**5-18**] CT abd: pneumonia in the right lung base, b/l trace pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, severe atherosclerosis, no ischemic colitis, milk of calcium vs. tiny GB stone in the GB, status post hysteretomy - [**5-18**] abd U/S- no GB wall thickening, possible + [**Doctor Last Name **] sign - [**5-22**] CT abd pelvis (OSH)- b/l pleural effusion, atelectasis, cholelithiasis, + ascites, levocurvature of the lumbar spine, coronary atherosclerosis and calficication of the abdominal aorta.
- [**5-20**]- C diff + - [**5-26**] CT ABDOMEN ([**Hospital1 18**]): There are bilateral moderate pleural effusion and bibasilar mild atelectasis.
Hyperdensity layering in the gallbladder wall likely represent small stones as seen on prior study (ultrasound [**2173-5-26**]).
The spleen, pancreas, adrenals, stomach, loops of small and large bowel appear unremarkable.
- [**5-26**] PELVIC CT ([**Hospital1 18**]): A Foley catheter is noted in the bladder.
The bladder, distal ureters, rectum and sigmoid appear unremarkable.
No CT findings to explain patient's symptoms.
[**2173-5-30**]: CXR IMPRESSIONS: Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions, with likely progressing multiple bilateral consolidations.
CT chest with IV contrast is recommended for further assessment.
[**2173-5-31**] CT chest:IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE performed showed depressed EF of 30%.
Infectious disease: Originally treated with unasyn (and later switched to cipro) for possible cholecystitis however this was discontinued after imaging and further evaluation revealed no evidence fo cholecystitis.
Endocrine: DM2, hold glipizide, RISS goal BG >150  The patient was ruled out for cholecystitis clinically and on imaging.
Had likely troponin leak from possible CHF exacerbation in the setting of sepsis or hypovolemia (given the labs showed hemoconcentration).
LVEF 30%.
However, pt's coumadin and flagyl likely interacted [**2173-6-1**] pt had an INR of 10.0, was given 10 units of vit K and INR the next day was 1.3, so pt was placed on a heparin drip while coumadin increased again back to therapeutic level.
# ID - pt has UA positive for yeast, consulted ID who recommended replacing the Foley and re-culturing from fresh Foley.
We did a CXR [**2173-5-31**] which showed a question of a lung consolidation, so we did a CT chest also [**2173-5-31**] which showed bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
Stool guiac positive, likely secondary to C-diff irritation of intestinal lining, however, did not definitively r/o GIB.
Pt running in SBP 140's throughout admission, so increased lisinopril from 2.5mg to 5mg then ([**2173-6-3**]) to 10mg.
Stool guiac was positive.
Lactate was 1.7 so less concerned for complication of ischemic bowel.
As pt's HCT is now stable but still low, will defer work-up of anemia to PCP.
Pt had high of 10.6, then gave vit K and INR then became 1.3, pt was then placed on heparin drip until could become therapeutic on warfarin.
