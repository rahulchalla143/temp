2) Retrocardiac opacity, which may represent pneumonia  CT abdomen/pelvis [**4-28**]: IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence for retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
Femoral U/S [**4-30**]: The right groin region was interrogated using a linear transducer.
CT head [**4-30**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR [**4-30**]: The previously identified left lower lobe pneumonia has been improving.
TTE [**4-30**]: There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
AP PELVIS AND RIGHT HIP: Exam consists of rotated AP film of the pelvis plus two additional views of the right hip and proximal femur.
underwent a CT scan of the pelvis which ruled-out a retroperitoneal bleed.
Right LE ultrasound showed no DVT or local abscess but demonstrated a possible A-V fistula and regional lymphadenopathy.
A pulsus paradoxus was checked, BP varied 8-10mmHg.
An echocardiogram was subsequently performed (after pt.
transferred to MICU, as below) and demonstrated slightly reduced EF (50-55%), symmetric LVH, 3+ TR, trivial pericardial effusion and no evidence of tamponade.
Routine blood pressure was taken and was noted to be 80's/60.
A MICU evaluation was performed and in the setting of encephalopathy and hypotension, the pt was transferred to the MICU.
There she was volume resuscitated with intravenous fluids with response (mental status cleared, blood pressure improved).
A repeat CXR showed increased retrocardiac consolidation on the left.
had a head CT which was negative for acute intracranial pathology and an EEG given her history of seizures.
A repeat femoral ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of pseudoaneusym or hematoma.
Her blood cultures remained negative.
In addition to the studies performed as detailed above, the pt.
She was slated to undergo an MRI of the pelvis and thigh to rule-out psoas abscess but the pt.
Seizure disorder: EEG performed in the MICU was consistent encephalopathy and there were no epileptiform discharges noted.
