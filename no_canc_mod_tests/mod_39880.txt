Portable CXR [**2190-5-1**]: SINGLE BEDSIDE FRONTAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: An endotracheal tube is in place, terminating 3.5 cm above the carina.
CT Cervical spine [**2190-5-1**]: IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment involving the cervical spine.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2190-5-1**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Postoperative CT Head noncontrast [**2190-5-1**]: Status post right craniotomy and evacuation of epidural hematoma.
On the left side, note is made of subarachnoid and parenchymalhemorrhage, unchanged from the comparison study and most notable in the left frontal and temporal lobes.
CTA Head [**2190-5-1**]: The major intracranial arteries are patent.
CT Head noncontrast [**2190-5-2**]: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to postoperative study.
CT Sinus/ Mandible/Maxillofacial noncontrast [**2190-5-2**]: FINDINGS: Again seen are multiple complex facial, skull base, and temporal [**Month/Day/Year 500**] fractures.
Residual pneumocephalus is present in the right middle cranial fossa, along with a heterogeneous extra-axial fluid collection measuring up to 8 mm in depth.
Hemorrhagic contusions measuring 3 x 2.2 cm in the left temporal lobe and 2.2 x 1.3 cm in the left frontal lobe continue to evolve.
Upper cervical spine alignment is preserved.
Multiple facial, skull base, and temporal [**First Name3 (LF) 500**] fractures, as described above.
CT Head Noncontrast [**2190-5-3**]: Stable appearance of brain with multiple fractures, right craniotomy and residual extra-axial fluid collection, left frontotemporal contusion, diffuse subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage, global cerebral edema, and blood in paranasal sinuses and middle ear cavities.
Chest Xray [**2190-5-6**]: Lung volumes are low.
[**5-7**] CT Orbit: IMPRESSION: 1.
Repeat imaging following resolution of hemorrhage would be helpful.
[**5-10**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**5-11**] CXR - negative   Brief Hospital Course: On [**2190-5-1**], the patient was transferred to the operating room emergently for Right epidural hematoma evacuation.
On [**2190-5-2**], repeat CT head was stable.
On [**2190-5-3**], dilantin dose was increased, CT head was stable, and the patient was started on precedex and fentanyl infusions in an attempt to wean sedation for extubation.
ENT was consulted for Bilateral temporal [**Month/Year (2) 500**] fractures and a dedicated CT temporal [**Month/Year (2) 500**] was obtained.
Pt will need an audiogram and ENT followup at a later date.
On [**5-8**], The patient's potassium was repleated for a level of 3.0.
The patient's potassium was repleated for a level of 3.2.
The patient's INR 1.8 was fpund to be slightly elevated.
The decision was made to not reverse this INR for risk of DVT/PE per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
A  non contrast head CT was ordered which was stable.
INR was again elevated and it was decided to continue to monitor.
A culture was added on.
WBC was noted to be elevated which was thought to be due to UTI, but INR was within normal limits.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
