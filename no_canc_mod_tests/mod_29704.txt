She also noticed that her abdomen was distended, and her lower abdomen was red.
On CT scan at the OSH, there was a ventral hernia containing a bowel loop with contrast extravasation from the bowel into the soft tissue of the anterior abd wall as well as air and inflammation in the abdominal wall.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
TTE [**8-14**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).

CPR was immediately initiated, atropine was given and she recovered pulse and pressure nicely.
Echo showed no evidence of any cardiac dysfunction, except for mild tricuspid regurgitation.
Cardiology c/s was obtained and despite extensive workup including repeat TTE, EKGs, telemetry, no etiology of arrest was identified.
Electrolytes were optimized as appropriate and no further cardiac abnormalities were appreciated until [**2173-8-20**] when she had PAF as high as 200bpm.
She also developed some edema and redness of her left lower leg and a duplex scan was done on [**2173-8-17**] which ruled out DVT.
The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Her blood sugars were monitored routinely and she was placed on her pre op Actos once she tolerated a regular diet.
She was reluctant to start insulin and was instructed to record her blood sugars and follow up in 1 week with her PCP for review and possible medication adjustment.
Ultrasound was obtained POD3 showing fluid collection that was I&D'd at bedside.
Cultures were sent which revealed enterococcus.
