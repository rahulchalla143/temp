Radiologic Data: [**12-10**] CT C-spine IMPRESSION: No acute fracture.
[**12-10**] CT pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Grade 2 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.
This is increased compared with prior exam dated [**2162-6-28**], at which time it was grade 1.
The acuity of this displacement is not clearly defined on the CT scan.
[**12-10**] CXR (PA/Lat) IMPRESSION: Large left pleural effusion.
#)Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: The patient's initial chest CT noted mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Though this is likely reactive in the setting of parapneumonic effusion, an interval chest CT should be obtained 1 month following discharge.
No evidence of cardiac etiology-no EKG changes, no changes in cardiac enzymes.
Lactate level was not elevated.
#) Fall: CT head on admission without any evidence of bleeding.
#) Anemia: Iron studies consistent with acute inflammatory state.
Pt's hematocrit was trending upwards at time of discharge.
You were given intravenous antibiotics and medicines to help support your blood pressure in the ICU.
Followup Instructions: Please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within a week of discharge from rehab  You should have a CT scan of your chest within the next 1-2months to follow up a scan here that showed enlargement of some lymph nodes.
