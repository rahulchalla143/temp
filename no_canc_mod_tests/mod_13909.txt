CT perfusion study indicates infarction of the entire middle cerebral artery territory on the right.
This infarction is occult on the conventional noncontrast CT study at this time, indicating acuity.
Suggest ultrasound for futher evaluation when the patient is stable, if not performed previously.
Head  CT showed an area of hypodensity in R MCA territory with perfusion deficits.
CTA showed occlusion in M1.
NIHSS was 19.
Repeat head CT showed extensive R MCA territory infarct, with edema, resulting in compression of the R lateral [**Doctor Last Name 534**], but no evidence of hemorrhagic conversion or herniation.
Serial head CTs remained stable.
Her infarct was likely secondary to an embolic event in the context of being subtherapeutic on Coumadin prior to her recent cataract surgery.
Her A1C was 6.0%, and her LDL was 122, for which she was started on simvastatin.
Exam at discharge was notable for left sided weakness and neglect, worse in the arm than in the leg, with flattening of the left nasolabial fold.
INR on presentation was 1.3.
An echocardiogram demonstrated no sign of thrombus.
