There was only trivial MR and his LVEF was estimated at 60%.
Cardiac catheterization back in [**2144-9-10**] showed normal coronary arteries.
A recent carotid ultrasound in [**2145-6-10**] revealed bilateral carotid artery plaques, left worse than right, associated with luminal narrowings stable since [**2144-2-11**] (diameter reduction less than 40% on the right and between 60 and 69% on the left).

[**2145-6-14**] ECHO Prebypass  1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Routine chest x-ray revealed a sizeable right sided pneumothorax.
He remained stable over the next several days and the pneumothorax was followed very closely by serial chest x-rays.
He appeared to be doing well with stable labs and physical exam on post-op day eight.
He will return monday for a chest x-ray to again evaluate his small right apical pneumothorax.
