Evaluation by his primary care provider showed hypercholesterolemia.
He was also sent for exercise tolerance test on [**7-18**], which demonstrated inferior septal apical ischemia.
Following his exercise tolerance test he was referred for cardiac catheterization, and on [**7-29**], the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed 100% proximal right coronary artery, 30% left main, 50 to 90% left anterior descending, 60% proximal circumflex and an ejection fraction of 61%.
Following cardiac catheterization the patient was referred for cardiothoracic surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, heartrate 55, blood pressure 105/58, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils equally round and reactive to light with extraocular movements intact, uninjected, anicteric.
Feet are warm bilaterally, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 9.4, hematocrit 37.5, platelets 253, sodium 134, potassium 3.7, chloride 102, carbon dioxide 24, BUN 20, creatinine 0.7, glucose 185, PT 12.8, PTT 28.2, INR 1.0.
Urinalysis is negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was discharged home following cardiac catheterization and returned as a postoperative admit on [**8-8**].
He had coronary artery bypass grafting times three with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the posterior left ventricular, bypass time was 127 minutes with a crossclamp time of 81 minutes.
At the time of transfer the patient's mean arterial pressure was 93.
At the time of discharge the patient's physical examination revealed temperature 99.1, heartrate 66, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 112/70, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturations 96% on room air.
Weight preoperatively 88.6 kg, at discharge 82.6 kg.
Laboratory data revealed white count 12, hematocrit 27, platelets 387, sodium 145, potassium 4.7, chloride 106, carbon dioxide 29, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 96, magnesium 2.3.
Respiratory clear to auscultation bilaterally.
