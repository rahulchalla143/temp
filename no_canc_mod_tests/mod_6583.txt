He can not feel when he goes into atrial fibrillation unless his rate is really quick.
In the ED, initial VS T 98, BP 126/72, HR 114, RR 20, O2 91% on RA.
Exam was notable for bibasilar crackles and irregularly irregular HR.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes.
CXR showed evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and ?

JNC VI Stage 2 hypertension -PACING/ICD:  none - chronic systolic CHF - EF 30-35% on [**2118-6-27**] echo -mild diastolic HF per [**2109**] cath - paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, s/p cardioversion [**2118-8-27**] followed by initiation of amiodarone .
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Rheumatoid Arthritis - HTN - ?
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: T 96, HR 101, BP 100/77, RR 15, 93% on 5L GENERAL: Pleasant, well appearing male in NAD HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: 1+ edema of ankles and shins, 1+ distal pulses, no  calf tenderness.
CXR [**9-4**]: UPRIGHT AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There is increased opacity in the right lower lobe.
Backrgound prominence of interstitial markings, consistent with known interstial disease seen on prior CT is noted, ([**2118-7-17**]).
CXR [**9-5**]: FINDINGS: Since [**2118-9-4**], increased opacification of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and of the right lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia or less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.
EKG [**9-4**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-8-23**] the ventricular response is faster.

# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure:  EF 30-35% on echo [**6-28**].
He lost about 3 kg from his admission weight and his dry weight seems to be 95 kg.
He was also advised to follow a low salt diet and give himself an extra dose of Lasix 40mg if his weight increases 5 pounds above his baseline dry weight.
His INR remained therapeutic on his home Coumadin dosing.
His initial rate in atrial fibrillation was up to the 120s so his metoprolol dosing was increased to 50mg twice daily and his home digoxin was continued.
His rate then improved to the 70s, but it is unclear whether his rate would have improved with diuresis alone.
- He will continue his anticoagulation with alternating coumadin 2 mg and 2.5 mg daily with a goal INR [**2-22**].
- He will undergo a repeat cardioversion in [**3-23**] weeks after amiodarone has reached steady state wit Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
# CAD:  2VD on cath [**2109**].
- CEs were negative times 2.
# ARF:  His creatinine bumped to 1.3 from his baseline of 1.0.
The creatinine trended down to 1.2 prior to discharge.
Labs to check Chem-7, Dig level and INR will be done in 1 week.
# Lactic acidosis:  Initial lactate 3.9 with anion gap 15.
Sugar 300s on admission chemistry panel and A1C=8.2.
He had QID FS and his sugars were covered with ISS.
Multiple pulmonary nodules and mediastinal LAD on CT [**7-17**] concerning for infection vs neoplasm.
Plan was for outpatient follow up for PET CT and possible bronchoscopy with biopsy vs mediastinoscopy for tissue diagnosis.
