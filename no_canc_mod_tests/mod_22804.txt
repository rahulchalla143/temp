Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-7-21**], a normally functioning, well-seated aortic CoreValve prosthesis is seen.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

Aortography demonstrated mild aortic regurgitation (1+), and trans-esophageal echocardiography showed mild (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation.
Echocardiogram performed prior to discharge indicated that corevalve prosthesis was in place and well sealed with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
EF was <55%.
All of the appropriate labs and studies for corevalve study were performed.
# Rhythm- The patients pre-op EKG demonstrated a native RBBB, and given the risk of post procedure conduction abnormalities a temporary pacemaker was placed.
His weight was monitored throughout admission.
Grafts patent on cath in [**2119-5-31**].
Transitional Issues: - Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization.
This procedure went well and the echocardiogram shows that the valve is working well.
