He was referred for outpatient cardiac catheterization to further evaluate the progression of his aortic disease.
He is status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the right coronary artery in [**2184**] and is status post repeat cardiac catheterization in [**2186**] revealing the RCA to be patent and no other significant disease noted.
He has some left arm numbness that occurs at the end of one and a half miles and also chest tightness and dyspnea after he walks up hills.
His most recent echocardiogram done on [**2191-4-1**], revealed moderate aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.9 cm squared and a peak aortic gradient of 64 mm/Hg with a mean aortic gradient of 42 mm/Hg and an ejection fraction of 55%.
Status post repeat cardiac catheterization in [**2186**].
Status post lung biopsy in [**2168**].
Carotids 2+ and equal bilaterally without bruits.
Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.
Pulses were 2+ and equal bilaterally throughout.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2191-5-23**], which revealed the left ventricle had heavily calcified aortic valve and mitral annular calcification.
The ventriculography was not performed because of an increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure and history of renal failure.
RCA had a proximal in-stent re-stenoses to 40% tapering down from ostium, diffusely diseased mid RCA and an ostial 30-40% lesion.
He had a carotid ultrasound which showed no significant stenoses bilaterally.
DISCHARGE LABS:  Hematocrit 27.2, white count 8,600, platelet count 174,000.
Sodium 137, potassium 4, chloride 99, CO2 31, BUN 17, creatinine 1.7, blood sugar 93.
KCl 40 mEq p.o.
