He underwent an MRI of the pelvis without contrast to rule out local recurrence of metastasis.
This examination was notable for no evidence of definite tumor recurrence, no evidence of hydronephrosis, but was notable for a soft tissue signal at the anterior pelvic floor representing either radiation changes or inflammation.
A bone scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease.
CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed with and without contrast.
These studies were notable for a fluid collection with air measuring 4.4 x 1.8 cm anterior to the pubic symphysis with extension inferolaterally to the space between the left pectineus and adductor musculature.
A culture of the sinus drainage grew alpha Streptococcus, Carinii bacterium (diphtheroids), gram-negative rods (species not elucidated).
Anaerobic culture was notable for a mixed bacterial flora.
Of note, preoperatively, the patient had an echocardiogram that was notable for a normal ejection fraction and normal wall motion.
A wound culture of the abscess grew alpha Streptococcus and gram-positive rods (unable to further identify).
Anaerobic culture was negative.
Culture of the bone revealed gram-positive rods, alpha Streptococcus, Carinii bacterium, [**Female First Name (un) 564**] (presumptive identification), Prevotella, but no acid-fast bacilli.
Bone pathology revealed extensively necrotic soft tissue and cartilage with acute inflammation, fibrinopurulent exudate, and granulation tissue, as well as acute osteomyelitis.
