Creatinine at that time on admission was 1.8.
She had an ultrasound with Doppler [**12-12**] showing increased flow in the TIPS.
Intraoperatively you way hypotensive to SBP 70s, treated with 1L 5% albumin and neo gtt without complication.
[**Name (NI) **], pt again became hypotensive to the 70s, asymmptomatic and resolve with 50g 25% albumin and 500cc NS.

Micro: [**2145-12-21**] URINE CULTURE (Final [**2145-12-22**]):       MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN       AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
Last therapeutic tap had been [**12-13**].
Ultrasound showed lack of wall-to-wall flow in the mid to distal TIPS, suggestive of neo-intimal hyperplasia.
Given the history of apparent improvement in ascites after placement and subsequently after revision of TIPS, she underwent TIPS revision with 10 mm balloon and improved flow.
Paracentesis of 6 L was done at the time of revision, and an additional 11.25 liters were taken off two days later, with albumin replacement each time.
# Hypotension:  Intraoperatively while under general anesthesia, patient was hypotensive with SBP 70s.
She was transferred briefly to the MICU, where blood pressure returned to baseline SBP 90s with IVF and albumin.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine at OSH was increased from baseline 1.5 to 2.0.
On admission, creatinine was 1.7.
Urinary sodium was <10, consistent with prerenal vs HRS.
She was given albumin at the time of paracentesis, and creatinine trended down to 1.5 prior to discharge.
# Pancytopenia: Hematocrit and platelets were at baseline.
