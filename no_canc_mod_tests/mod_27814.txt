A head CT showed subarachnoid blood.
He lives in a 2 story home with wife, still drives  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Vit: 95.3   75   105/73  15   98% SM with 4L NC I/O: 24 hr 1750/2115, last 16 hr 2275/1515 Gen: elderly male, resting in bed, face mask in place HEENT: Bilateral eye bruising, dried blood at nares, no icterus, EOMI, PERRLA, neck supple, + jvd CV: RRR, s1s2, [**1-14**] SM at LUSB Pulm: Decreased breath sounds at bases, scattered wheezes and few crackles in lower lung fields, right worse than left ABD: + BS, soft, mild RUQ tenderness, no guarding EXT: no peripheral edema, 2+ radial and DP pulses NEURO: CN II-XII intact, alert and appropriate with exam/questioning  Pertinent Results: [**4-16**]: ECHO Conclusions: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[**4-12**] C-spine: Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and grade 1 retrolisthesis of C5 on C6 are stable during flexion and extension.
[**2104-4-10**]: trauma CT torso: No evidence of acute traumatic injury or active extravasation.
Followup imaging is recommended when patient is stable .
[**2104-4-10**] CT head: 1.
While this may relate to subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to trauma and anticoagulation, a CT angiogram would be necessary to exclude underlying aneurysm.
Third and lateral ventricular dilatation, raising possibility of early obstructive hydrocephalus.
Brief Hospital Course: # SAH - CT scan in the ED showed large subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and suprasellar cisterns.
A CTA of the head showed no evidence of aneurysm, bleed was likely due to trauma from fall and anticoagulation.
ECHO showed EF 60-65%.
Patient should follow up with his outpatient pulmonologists at the VA for further monitoring and management of his shortness of breath after discharge from rehab.
He had a video swallow which showed mild to moderate oral, mild pharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids which were prevented by chin tuck maneuver.
Pt should have a repeat swallow study done at a later date to assess for improvement in function.
