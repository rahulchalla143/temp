He recieved 2L NS and was started on labetolol gtt and BP decreased to 161/79.
At that time BP was attributed to abdominal pain and inability to take PO meds d/t nausea/vomiting.

In the MICU he became hypotensive to SBP 80s.
Labetalol was stopped and he received a 500cc fluid bolus and his blood pressure rose to SBP 90s.
Cardiac and infectious sources of hypotension were considered, but cardiac enzymes were not changed from prior studies and he had no localizing signs of infection; blood cultures were sent and a ultrasound of the L arm AVF ordered to rule out abscess at the site.
Over night, his blood pressure trended up to 130s systolic.
He was restarted on his home blood pressure regimen.
He was to be called out to the medical floor on [**2186-2-26**] but became somnolent after receiving pain and anti-nausea meds, so he stayed in the ICU for closer monitoring of respiratory status, which spontaneously improved.
His blood sugar at 10pm was low at 22 and he was disoriented, which resolved with two glasses of juice; he did not receive his standing dose of NPH that evening.
Blood cultures returned positive with GPC in pairs and clusters, so a TTE and surveillance cultures were ordered and vancomycin was started.
