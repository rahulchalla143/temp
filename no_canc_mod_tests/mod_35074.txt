If acute pulmonary symptoms are clinically present, a PA/Lateral chest radiograph is recommended.
A chest CT should also be considered for further evaluation when clinically appropriate.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-2-17**], the rhythm still appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Left ventricular function is less dynamic (but still normal).

Sensitivity testing performed by Etest.
# abdominal pain / constipation / impaction -  pt's abdominal pain was felt to likely be secondary to constipation, given his imaging with severe diffuse fecal loading and massive inguinal hernias containing loops of colon.
He also underwent manual disimpaction, which revealed hard trace guaiaic positive stools.
# acute kidney injury / urinary retention - Patient was noted to have a creatinine of 1.9 from a baseline of 0.5.
His creatinine resolved with IVF.
His urinary retention was felt possible [**3-17**] narcotic use and constipation.
Foot XRAY was obtained which raised concern for possible osteomyeletis, however, after discussion with podiatry, this was felt unlikely.
ESR was 17, and CRP was 85, however felt there was contribution from UTI and constipation.
His initial delerium was felt multifactorial with contribution from narcotic administration, anticholinergics/benzo's at his nursing home, constipation, urinary tract infection.
TSH was 1.2.
TTE was performed which showed preserved EF.
he should have repeat potassium checked on 1d after discharge, and repleted as needed, for goal K>3.7 given atrial fibrillation above.
