Briefly, the patient present to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**9-20**] with severe abdominal pain worsened by inspiration and was found to be febrile to 102.7, tachycardic to HR 130s, and have significant LFT abnormalities (lipase 6391, T.bili 1.7, D. bili 1.3, AST 281, ALT 134, AP 285).
He had some hypotension to SBP 90s on the night of admission, however he never required pressor support.
[**9-21**] Blood cultures revealed GNRs in 4 of 4 bottles; spec/[**Last Name (un) 36**] are pending.
The patient had an attempted ERCP [**9-21**] which was aborted as the ERCP scope was unable to be passed into the second part of the duodenum secondary to a significant stricture of the duodenal bulb, just before the D1/D2 junction.
Labs on discharge were lipase 1313, T.bili 3.6, D.bili 3.0, AST 161, ALT 126, AP 210, LDH 262.
Blood cultures growing GNRs (prelim) were still pending.
Of note, the patient's gallbladder was not visualized on either abdominal ultrasound or MRCP on [**9-20**].
He had an attempted laparascopic cholecystectomy in [**2178**] which was aborted due to extensive adhesions, but he and his family are certain that he has not had his gallbladder removed.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], VS were: T 98.1, 151/71, HR 76, SpO2 96%RA, RR 15.
Most recently had an episode of amaurosis fugax in spring [**2182**] & saw his neurologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6692**], who did carotid dopplers on [**2182-5-30**] that showed severe bilateral ICA disease >70% bilaterally.
- Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - S/p right inguinal herniorhapy x 3 with 3rd operation requiring removal of his right testicle ([**2140**]) - Meniere's disease with recent complaints of refractory dizziness earlier this summer [**2182**] - Tinnitus (likely related to Meniere's) - Hearing loss in left ear - Seizure disorder on low-dose Tegretol (did not tolerate switch to Keppra; high-dose Tegretol has been associated with cognitive slowing).
EEG showed L temporal seizure activity.
