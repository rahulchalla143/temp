Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed severe erosive esophagitis, question of [**Female First Name (un) 564**], and small gastric polyps.
The patient was brought to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department where his GCS was 6 with oxygen saturation in the 80s.
He was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure in the 120s and heart rate in the 90s.
Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe pneumonia and bilateral apical opacities.
CT of the head was negative.
CT of the spine was negative for any cervical spine fractures.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and treatment.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed blood pressure of 90/45, temperature maximum 102.4, heart rate 96 to 110, respiratory rate 16 to 21, oxygen saturation 95 to 98% on "many" liters of oxygen.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - The pupils are 2.0 millimeters and reactive bilaterally.
Respiratory is clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Examination limited due to the patient's unresponsiveness.
Neurologically, the patient is moving all four extremities, withdraws to pain, no posturing, no corneal or gag reflex (but on Propofol).
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 17.6, hematocrit 34.3, platelets 364,000, neutrophils 71%, bands 18%, lymphocytes 6%.
Urinalysis is nitrite positive, protein trace, bilirubin small, pH 5.0, blood negative, red blood cells 0 per high power field, white blood cells 0-2 per high power field, bacteria rare.
Chem7 revealed sodium 141, potassium 4.4, chloride 105, bicarbonate 13, blood urea nitrogen 56, creatinine 4.2, glucose 100, anion gap 23.
CPK [**Numeric Identifier 40281**], MB 91, index 0.8.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, PR interval 204 consistent with first degree AV block, left atrial enlargement, QRS 140, Q-Tc 450, peaked T waves, 1.0 to 2.
[**Street Address(2) 27948**] elevation in V1, V2, but pattern is left bundle branch block, no T wave inversions, Q wave only in lead III.
IMAGING STUDIES:  CT of the head revealed cerebellar atrophy, mucosal thickening of maxillary and ethmoid sinus.
CT spine revealed normal alignment of vertebra, no fractures, no subluxation, positive degenerative changes in C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7.
Chest x-ray revealed hazy opacities in the bilateral apices and right lower lobe - ?
Carbamazepine levels were monitored q3hours.
Pulmonary - Due to the patient's findings on chest x-ray of right lower lobe and bilateral apical opacities, he was assumed to have suffered an aspiration event causing aspiration pneumonia.
The patient's lung findings improved rapidly over the course of the stay and for the last six days he was clear to auscultation bilaterally with normal oxygen saturation and no signs or symptoms, i.e., cough.
Renal - Initially the patient's creatinine was increased to 4.2.
Multiple Clostridium difficile toxin assays were sent which were negative.
His abdominal examination continued to appear benign.
His CT of the head was negative for any acute process.
Cerebrospinal fluid cultures for HSV and urine toxicology screens were negative, not consistent with these as possible etiologies of altered mental status.
A few days later, a CT was done of the head again which showed minimal intraventricular and subarachnoid blood.
Neurology recommendations included electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance scan to further workup altered mental status.
Two lumbar punctures were also done, one at admission and one later on.
Both were bloody with increased protein, however, CT of the head initially did not reveal an acute bleed.
The repeat CT on [**2100-11-4**], is stated above.
Follow-up CT will need to be obtained one week after discharge.
Hematology - The patient's hematocrit was 34.3 on admission and dropped to 26.7 on hospital day number one.
He was transfused with two units after which his hematocrit remained stable for the duration of the admission.
Trauma - He was seen by trauma surgery to be evaluated for cervical spine instability; they recommended that he be kept in a cervical collar even though he had no fracture, since ligamentous injury was not ruled out at the time.
Later on in the course of the hospitalization when he was moved to the floor, flexion and extension spine films were done and approved by neurosurgery as clear and thus the collar was removed.
He will follow-up with neurosurgery a week or two after discharge when he will be reevaluated with flexion and extension films as well as a head CT to follow his subarachnoid blood and intraventricular blood seen on CT of the head on [**2100-11-4**].
DFA for HSV type I and type II as well as ZBZ were negative except for an HSV type I DFA which was positive.
All other cultures of the wound were negative and Acyclovir, which was started empirically when dermatology first saw him for HSV, was discontinued when these cultures and DFA came back negative.
They recommended an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance scan to evaluate mental status if this did not improve once he was extubated.
They also were questioning the fact that his Carbamazepine level of 33 implied overingestion, suggesting possible assault or possible suicide attempt.
Neurology: he had a repeat head CT done on the day of transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor which was not different from the [**2100-11-4**] study and was notable for perhaps a slightly larger bleed ("subdural fluid collection").
It was decided that a repeat CT would be done one to two weeks after discharge when following up with neurosurgery unless there was significant clinical deterioration.
Magnetic resonance scan and electroencephalogram were postponed as the patient's mental status continued to improve progressively and once he was awake, was alert and oriented times three.
His hematocrit remained stable during his hospital floor course and his abrasions on his extremities continued to be treated with Bacitracin Ointment application to the wounds with dressing changes twice a day.
