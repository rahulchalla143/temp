No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful to more fully evaluate this region when the patient's condition permits, particularly to exclude a developing pneumonia at this site.
MRI can be obtained for further evaluation as clinically indicated.
Similar foci of high signal intensity are seen within the cerebellum as well as the brainstem on T2 and FLAIR images, most consistent with sequelae of microvascular ischemia.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 75%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-11-27**], no obvious change, but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes direct comparison.
[**12-15**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in appearance of the bilateral, right more than left opacities, suggesting pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia.
[**12-18**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**12-15**], there is slight improvement in the pulmonary edema.

Patient was continued on warfarin for stroke prophylaxis with INR goal [**12-27**].
She should be followed with INR checks two times per week.
Due to the event she did have a head CT and MRI that suggested a subacute CVA in the frontal and parietal lobe.
Neuro was consulted and recommended carotid ultrasounds which were normal.
A repeat echocardiogram to further assess valves was ordered and was negative for vegetations.
On the floor patient experienced intermittent episodes of asymptomatic hypotension with systolic blood pressures ~ 70s x 3days.
Her blood pressure returned to her likely baseline systolics in the 60's-80's and was thought to be downregulation of her alpha receptors while on neosynephrine.
Weight at discharge: 153.1 pounds.
However, you required extra days in the hospital to control your atrial fibrillation, to regulate your blood pressure, and to treat a heart failure exacerbation.
Please have your INR checked twice a week for a goal INR of [**12-27**].
