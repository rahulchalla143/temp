As the patient remained in a narrow complex tachycardia, the team felt comfortable using diltiazem for rate control in addition to beta blockers as his rate was not well controlled and the likelihood of him converting into a wide complex tachycardia was low.
His rate was eventually controlled on a diltiazem drip and the amiodarone was discontinued.
He will be seen as an outpatient to discuss the possibility of ablation of the WPW bypass tract to prevent further episodes of wide complex tachycardia.
# [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]:  The patient presented with a TEE done at [**Hospital 1474**] hospital which showed evidence of a left atrial appendage thrombus.
A TTE was done which could not visualize the left atrial appendage, therefore could not rule out the presence of a thrombus.
A TEE was done here which showed no thrombus.
The patient was discharged on coumadin with instructions to follow up with his primary care physician for an INR check on Monday following discharge.
The CXR on admission showed possible LLL and RLL infiltrate, thus the patient was started on doxycycline and ceftriaxone for CAP.
The patient also had a UA which showed possible evidence of a UTI however the urine culture was negative.
