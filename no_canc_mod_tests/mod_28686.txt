The study demonstrated right SFA popliteal disease with single-vessel runoff via the peroneal artery.
The right foot and blood toes remained the same but in the last 48 hours there is increasing erythema, edema and drainage from the wound.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: 95.3 axillary, 104, 18, blood pressure 111/85, O2 sats 97% on room air.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremity exam shows left foot is pale, cool, without lesions.
Pulse exam shows 2+ femoral pulses with 1+ popliteal, BP, and PT bilaterally.
Wound cultures were obtained and she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy of vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl.
Wound culture Gram stain showed no polys or microorganisms.
The wound culture was finalized as no growth.
The patient's INR on admission was 2.9.
Her medications were adjusted to improve her blood pressure and heart rate for a goal of systolic pressure of 120-140 and a pulse rate of 60 or less.
The graft pulse was marginal after the second surgery and decision was made if the graft failed that no further surgical intervention would be attempted.
The patient was weaned off Neo-Synephrine for systolic blood pressure control.
She was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26.
Arterial studies were done on [**2141-10-2**] which showed on the right foot 3 mm pressure wave tracings and on the left 2 mm.
Post transfusion hematocrit was 29.3.
Physical therapy was requested through the patient for evaluation for discharge planning.
The goal INR is 2.0-3.0.
She should follow up with her primary care physician for monitoring of her INR and adjustment of her Coumadin dosing as required.
