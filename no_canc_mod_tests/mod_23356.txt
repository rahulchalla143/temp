Pt underwent ablative procedure successfully on [**2189-1-13**], but in setting of chest pain was noted to have SBP in 100s, and HR in 100s.
Lowest BP noted to be 79/70 during procedure.
ECHO revealed circumferencial effusion (1-1.5cm width).
Repeat transthoracic echo preliminarily appeared to show mild increase in size of pericardial effusion.
NECK: JVP not elevated CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.

An echo showed mild increase in the size of the effusion post procedure, with some evidence of impaired filling consistent with tamponade.
Repeat echo the following day on [**2189-1-14**] showed some resolution of the pericardial effusion and less evidence of tamponade.
