SINGLE SEMI UPRIGHT AP BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: All invasive lines and tubes have been removed including right-sided chest tube.
Lung volumes are low and retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis in this postoperative patient, though consolidation is also a possibility.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.6 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.6 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 55% (nl >=55%) Left Ventricle - Peak Resting LVOT gradient: 8 mm Hg (nl <= 10 mm Hg) Aorta - Valve Level: *3.7 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *3.9 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: *4.0 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 65 mm Hg Aortic Valve - Mean Gradient: 44 mm Hg Aortic Valve - Valve Area: *1.1 cm2 (nl >= 3.0 cm2) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.9 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.29 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 142 msec  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Results were personally  Conclusions: Prebypass  1.No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed globally.
Right ventricular systolic function is unchanged.
