ECHO [**2104-3-25**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with inferior/inferolateral/inferoseptal akinesis and moderate to severe hypokinesis elsewhere.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
ECHO [**2104-3-27**]: There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and posterior akinesis.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CT Head [**2104-3-29**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or large acute territorial infarction.
The spinal cord cannot be assessed on CT and MRI might be considered if clinically indicated.
EEG [**2104-3-26**]: This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of a slow background which was generally in the delta and theta frequency range representing a moderate to severe diffuse encephalopathy.
Brain MRI [**4-3**]: FINDINGS: The parenchymal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is maintained.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

He had an unknown down time and chest compressions were not started before paramedics arrived.
His urine output and MAP were monitored and he was given fluid boluses to keep urine output > 30cc/hr and MAP > 60mmHg.
His initial echo showed severe global hypokinesis with an EF of 25%.
His echo on HD 3 showed EF improved to 40% and no mechanical complications.
He showed gradual improvement in his neurologic exam over the course of his admission.
Per cardiac cath report, patient has no- minimal disease in other coronary arteries.
His initial echo showed EF 25% with global hypokinesis and his repeat echo was much improved with EF of 40% and improved ventricular function.
His initial neurologic exam in the CCU was difficult given sedation and paralytics although reactive pupils were reassuring.
Post-extubation, his neuro exam continued to improve.
MRI brain revealed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality and no evidence of infarction identified.
His sputum grew strep pneumo and his cefepime was changed to ceftriaxone.
His vancomycin was initially continued as he has 1 blood culture bottle that grew GPCs, found to be coag negative staph, likely contaminant.
# Metabolic acidosis: On admission, patient had a pH of 7.09 with lactate of 4.5 on arrival to CCU.
His lactate improved with improved blood pressures and several amps of HCO3 and he had no other signs of leg ischemia or mesenteric ischemia.
# Leukocytosis: WBC was 22 on admission likely stress response from STEMI and cardiogenic shock.
On discharge, his CXR is clear and WBC is normal.
A cardiac catheterization was performed and you received 2 drug eluting stents to your right coronary artery.
