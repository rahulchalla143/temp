Her dilantin level was increased to a goal of 15-20 and she was started on Keppra.
A EEG was done without seizure activity noted.
The patient had a head CT which was stable.
Post operative CT shows a small amount of extra-axial blood is seen along the left cerebral hemisphere, adjacent to the falx and layering on the tentorium.
Her exam was deferred on the morning of [**12-1**] to give the patient privacy and as ensure that the patient remained comfortable.
The nurses were told to get vital signs at that time and the patient was found to have an O2 sat of 83% on a nonrebreather.
The patient's lips were blue at that point in time.
