Dilated IVC (>2.5 cm), with minimal respiratory variation c/w elevated RA pressure of >20 mmHg.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
CXR done [**12-4**] - small right pleural effusions, pulmonary nodules, perihilar lymph nodes.
ECHO at OSH showing EF 45-50%, globally dilated RV and hypokinesis, concentric LV hypertrophy could be ?cocaine induced cardiomyopathy vs. CHF.
Workup for PE was negative.
A PA catheter was placed, which showed severe pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 100/50.
expedited work-up and possible as outpt if patient has reliable follow-up plans.
h/o DVT/PE &#8211; Pt did not achieve therapeutic INR despite Coumadin and so Lovenox was started [**7-25**].
We continued in house and Factor Xa levels were therapeutic.
