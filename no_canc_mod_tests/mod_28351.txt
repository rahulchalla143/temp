Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-2-25**] the inferolateral ST-T wave changes have improved.
CTA Head ([**10-26**]): IMPRESSION: 1 Stable in appearance 5 x 4 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the right parietal lobe with mass effect and vasogenic edema and midline shift of 1.5 mm that is unchanged from previous examination.
However, this hemorrhage may mask an underlying lesion, and repeat imaging is recommended to follow up resolution and to assess for an underlying mass or malformation.
CXR ([**10-27**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2115-3-27**], there has been placement of a dual-channel pacemaker device, with the leads in the region of the apex of the right ventricle and the right atrium.
CT Head ([**10-27**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right parietal lobe that is largely unchanged in size and appearance from previous examination from [**2116-10-26**].
This intraparenchymal hemorrhage may mask an underlying lesion, recommend repeat followup imaging to ensure resolution.
CT Head ([**10-28**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Right intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right parietal lobe that is largely unchanged in size and appearance from previous examination from [**2116-10-27**].
His bp was 156/88 on admission to the OSH, and his INR was 2.6.
Neurosurgery was consulted on admission to [**Hospital1 18**], and recommended keeping INR <1.3 and no neurosurgical intervention.
CTA Head showed stable in appearance 5 x 4 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the right parietal lobe with mass effect and vasogenic edema and midline shift of 1.5 mm that is unchanged from previous examination, no evidence of arterial venous malformation or an underlying lesion.
CEs: CK 120-104-96, TropT <0.01; FLP Chol 162, TG 49, HDL 73, LDL 79; HgA1c 6.1%; TSH 0.92, LFTs WNL.
His blood pressure should remain SBP <160.
His urine culture showed no growth, and his blood culture was pending at the time of discharge.
His CRP was 7.1 on admission, but the patient then started complaining of headache and had tenderness to palpation of his left temporal lobe.
Repeat CRP was 46.2 and ESR 60.
Carotid ultrasound showed 0% carotid stenosis bilaterally on preliminary report.
