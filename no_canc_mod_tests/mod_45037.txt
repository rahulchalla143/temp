Sputum culture eventually grew out Pseudomonas and multidrug resistant Klebsiella.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination upon transfer, vital signs showed temperature of 98.6, blood pressure 152/84, heart rate 88, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 99% on 70% oxygen via tracheostomy collar.
Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm.
Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2 heart sounds auscultated.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on transfer was remarkable for the following, complete blood count demonstrated white blood count of .1, hematocrit 26.0, platelets 453.

Coagulation profile showed PT 13.8, PTT 34.3, INR 1.3.
A chest x-ray from [**2190-5-4**], showed a stable right effusion with patchy left lower lobe lingular infiltrates concerning for pneumonia.
Sputum culture from [**5-4**], demonstrated greater than 25 polymorphonuclear cells, 2+ gram negative rods and 1+ gram positive cocci in pairs.
She received oxygen via tracheostomy collar with it weaned down to oxygen saturation greater than 90%.
She underwent a bedside bronchoscopy on [**2190-5-5**] which demonstrated copious thick viscous secretions with purulent appearance.
She had sputum suctioning and pulmonary toilet via the bedside bronchoscopy and then had a repeat bronchoscopy the following day for a BAL and lavage sampling.
The patient's sputum eventually grew out multidrug resistant Klebsiella and Pseudomonas.
As questioned, this was related to her immunosuppressive therapy, however, to rule out thrombosis, she underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound which demonstrated patency of the portal vein, hepatic vessels and the previously placed hepatic artery stent as well as normal flow.
Sinusitis - While on the Medical Intensive Care Unit, early in this admission, the patient was noted to have increased nasal secretions around her nasogastric tube.
It is felt to be likely osmotic in nature as all culture data was negative and the patient demonstrated a dramatic decrease in her level of diarrhea after discontinuation of her tube feeds.
Hypertension - The patient was continued on Lisinopril and Norvasc titrated for blood pressure control.
Anemia - Iron studies demonstrated this to be an anemia of chronic disease.
Hematocrit was followed serially and the patient was transfused for a hematocrit less than 25.
Pain - The patient experienced significant pain from her sacral decubiti which was treated with Oxycodone.
