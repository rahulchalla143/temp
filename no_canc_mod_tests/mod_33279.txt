CTA Chest [**2111-6-22**]: 1.
CT Chest [**2111-7-4**]: IMPRESSION: Multifocal bilateral airspace opacities in the lungs, grossly unchanged from the prior study.
TTE [**2111-6-15**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
TTE [**2111-6-22**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
TTE [**2111-7-4**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT Head [**2111-6-18**] 1.
Air-fluid level seen in the sphenoid sinuses, which may be the result of long-term intubation or nasal feeding tube.
CT Head [**2111-7-4**]: No acute intracranial process.
If there is a high clinical concern for an infarct, an MRI with diffusion is recommended.
Abd X-ray [**2111-7-4**]: FINDINGS: A percutaneous feeding tube is present overlying the midabdominal region.
A non-obstructive bowel gas pattern is visualized with no evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
Abnormalities within the lung parenchyma are seen to better detail on the recent chest CT of earlier the same date.

Her course was notable for progressive worsening of her respiratory status during her OSH hospitalization, along with development of bilateral infiltrates.
A respiratory viral screen performed at the OSH was negative and was repeated at [**Hospital1 18**].
The initial DFA test was negative but the sample was sent to the state lab and there, it was positive for H1N1.
The ID service was consulted and recommended switching from vancomycin to linezolid and empirically completing a course of oseltamavir Of note, she also underwent a repeat chest CTA that was negative for PE and a TTE with a bubble study that was limited in quality but negative for intracardiac shunt.
Although sputum cx with persistence of pseudomonas, per ID this was thought to represent colonization.
No evidence of PE on CTA chest or right heart strain on echo; normal atria.
RIJ placed [**2111-6-20**] was pulled [**7-2**].
However, [**7-1**] blood cultures from a-line grew out yeast (presumptively not C. albicans) on [**7-3**]; her A-line and PICC were pulled.
TTE was suboptimal but without e/o endocarditis; ID did not think TEE needed.
As blood cx grew C. paraipsilosis, changed to fluconazole IV to complete 14-day course of antifungal (last dose [**2111-7-16**]).
Repeat blood cultures including mycolytic cultures showed no growth to date up until [**2111-7-6**].
CT Head was done [**7-4**] which showed no acute process and a TTE was without vegitations.
Pt later observed to be moving all 4 extremities and withdrawing to painful stimuli in L arm so no further work-up pursued.
A pelvic ultrasound was a very limited study but did not find any pathology.
Repeat bronch on [**6-17**] with path read of "lymphocytes, alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and rare plasma cells with insufficient tissue for immunohistochemical characterization"; cytology negative for malignant cells.

You likely had swine flu which was complicated by MRSA pneumonia.
However, you were examined by Ob-Gyn with a negative pelvic ultrasound and no evidence of any more bleeding.
