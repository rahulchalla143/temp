Rupture of membranes were less than 24 hours prior to delivery.
Apgars were 6 and 8.
Upon admission, growth parameters are as follows:  Weight 3135 grams; length 52.5 cm; head circumference 34.75 cm; temperature 97.1 rectal; heart rate 168; respiratory rate 70; blood pressure 56/30 with a mean of 34; oxygen saturations in room air 100%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the infant was pale pink with a hypotonic posture with mild tachypnea and mild intermittent grunting.
Lungs were clear to auscultation with good aeration.
Cardiac examination revealed regular rate and rhythm with no murmur and 2+ femoral pulses.
Blood pressures have been stable since that time.
On day of life #2 to #3, a cardiac murmur was noted.
A cardiac evaluation was performed.
Hyperoxia test revealed PAO2 of greater than 300.
4-extremity blood pressures were all within normal limits.
Chest x-ray revealed a normal cardiothymic silhouette.
On EKG there was right ventricular hypertrophy.
The Department of Cardiology was consulted and an echocardiogram revealed a small mid muscular VSD.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The infant was placed on maintenance IV fluids and in the latter half of day of life #1, enteral feedings were initiated by mouth.
Stools during the last couple of days have been trace guaiac positive, presumably from contamination from a recent circumcision, as well as a diaper dermatitis with excoriation.
The abdominal examination has been benign and he has been tolerating his feeding without any spitting or emesis.
Bilirubin levels have been insignificant with a peak bilirubin of 8.2/0.3 on day of life #4.
Mother's blood type is A negative, antibody negative and the infant blood type is A negative, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 36243**] negative.
Admission hematocrit was 32.6.
The next morning on [**2171-4-28**], the hematocrit was 27.1.
A Kleihauer-Betke test was positive.
On [**2171-5-1**], the hematocrit was 25.5 with the reticulocyte count of 5%.
A repeat hematocrit done prior to discharge on the morning of [**2171-5-4**] was 26.3 with a retic count=0.9%.
Close follow-up of his hematocrit is recommended, especially during the period of his physiologic nadir.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Due to his presentation and his early hypotension, a sepsis evaluation was performed.
The initial CBC had a white count of 16.3 with 38 polys, 25 bands.
At 48 hours the blood cultures remained negative.
Lumbar puncture was performed since the infant was going to receive seven days of antibiotics.
This revealed 6 red blood cells, 4 white blood cells, glucose of 41 and protein of 78.
On day of #3, Gentamicin levels were done, which were within normal limits with a peak of 11.3 and trough of 1.2.
A followup CBC on day of life #1 did show an improvement in the differential with 59 neutrophils and 4 bands.
CT scan without contrast was performed on the morning of [**2171-4-28**], which was negative for any intracranial hemorrhage, or other process.
The infant's neurological examination continued to improve with improving tone, improving activity, and improving interest in feeding.
The neurology attending was not impressed with the current physical examination and, therefore, did not recommended any further intervention at this time.
SENSORY:  Hearing screen was performed [**2171-5-2**].
Ophthalmology examination was not indicated due to the infant being full term.
IMMUNIZATIONS:  Hepatitis B vaccine - consent has been obtained and he was given the vaccine prior to discharge on [**2171-5-4**].
