PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission included a temperature of 102, heartrate 45 ,blood pressure 127/55.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram on admission had bradycardia with 46 rate per minute, old right bundle branch block compared with an electrocardiogram of [**2136-8-10**] which was the same.
Labs on admission included a white count of 20.1, hematocrit 40.7, platelets 472,000.
Chem-7 was 140/4.9, 96/31, BUN with creatinine of 45/3.0, glucose 146.
Urinalysis had a trace protein and otherwise negative.
Lithium on admission is level of 1.6, TSH was done and was pending.
Chest x-ray was negative.
Blood cultures were done.
The patient also had a head computerized tomography scan and an lumbar puncture performed at that time.
The patient had an arterial blood gases done at 7:45 on the day of admission which revealed 7.41, 53, and 63 with lactate of 2.3 and free calcium of 2.08.
Cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain had no polys seen, no organisms.
The cultures were pending, otherwise the lumbar puncture was normal.
Chest x-ray at that time also with elevated right hemidiaphragm.
The patient on [**8-2**] had an echocardiogram performed which was essentially unchanged from the previous study from [**2134**].
Left ventricular function was 55%, ascending aorta was mildly dilated.
Urinalysis remained clear.
The patient had hypotensive episodes, was febrile and was with infiltrates versus effusion on chest x-ray with chronic renal insufficiency.
From an infectious disease standpoint the patient remained febrile and had an lumbar puncture which was negative for any source of infection.
The patient also had a bronchoscopy for finding organisms which was negative.
The patient's oxygen saturations were 94% on 2 liters and was stable.
The patient was being transferred to the Medicine Service for further evaluation of her psychological issues which she developed while she was in the Intensive Care Unit, monitoring of her calcium and thyroid status and correction of hypernatremia with continuing monitoring of her blood pressure which had been stabilized.
Her blood pressure was stable and she came to the floor and her previous hypotensive state was attributed to hypothyroidism, but she was now being treated with Synthroid.
From a Psychiatry standpoint, we obtained RPR which came back negative, and B12 and Folate were within normal limits.
An magnetic resonance imaging scan of her head was obtained which also was negative for any acute events or acute ischemia.
On [**2136-8-17**], it was noted on examination that she had some proximal weakness of her right upper extremity with 2/5 strength in the right upper extremity, abduction.
Given her persistent low level hypernatremia, we obtained a urine osmolality on [**2136-8-16**] which revealed a urine osmolality of 176 and a urine sodium of 44.
At that time her serum sodium was 149.
Her oxygen saturation decreased and she was placed on 100% nonrebreather after which her oxygen saturation recovered into the mid 90s.
Chest x-ray was negative and given her old cerebrospinal fluid cultures being negative and a negative magnetic resonance imaging scan of her head several days prior to the event there was no clear etiology upon further workup.
But, given the fact that she had no recurrence of seizures and her electrolytes were stable at the time, it was concluded that it would be safe to discontinue any antiseizure medications.
Vital signs were stable and there were was no recurrence of seizure activity.
Her temperatures remained afebrile as well as her blood pressures remained relatively well at 130/80.
Urine cultures remained negative.
Chest x-rays remained negative.
Urine osmolality and urine sodium continued to show the patient had some evidence of some nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
The patient will continue on DDAVP for increased serum sodium 6.
Hypothyroidism which was treated with Synthroid  FOLLOW UP CARE:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for further evaluation and workup.
