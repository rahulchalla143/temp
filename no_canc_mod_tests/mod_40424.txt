Afterward, a tagged RBC scan failed to reveal any extravazation of blood.
5 days ago she had the sutures removed from her stoma.
In ED at [**Hospital1 18**] she was transiently hypotensive to SBP 70s.

Neuro: A&Ox3, speech fluent, moves all extremities.
A preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm the patient's name, procedure, and site.
The portogram confirmed the position of the balloon catheter within the right hepatic vein.
The venogram was performed through the catheter, which demonstrated multiple large collateral vessels.
The liver parenchyma track was dilated with an 9-mm balloon with an inflation pressure up to 12 atm.
Successful transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement with reduction of a pressure gradient between portal vein and right atrium at approximately 2 mmHg after the TIPS placed.
Inferior vena cava appears patent on color Doppler as is the right hepatic vein.
F/u Day 3 Post-TIPS Doppler U/S: TIPS ULTRASOUND: 2D, color flow, and Doppler examination of the abdomen was performed and compared with [**2133-5-28**].
Bilateral LENIs: FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and Doppler images of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained.
[**5-31**] PA/Lat CXR: There has been no significant change since the prior film of [**5-29**], 06, other than removal of the left jugular CV line.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 63 y/o female with UC s/p colectomy and colostomy 20 yrs ago and recently diagnosed cirrhosis after a variceal bleed in early [**Month (only) 547**] requiring ICU stay and a total of 11 units of PRBCs.
Afterward, a tagged RBC scan failed to reveal any extravazation of blood.
In ED at [**Hospital1 18**] she was transiently hypotensive to SBP 70s.
On initial exam in the MICU, she had no evidence of ascites, and diuretics were held.
Vitamin K was given for INR 1.5.
She had an ileoscopy on [**5-26**], which found friable tissue at the ioeostomy site exteriorly, with nonbleeding periileostomy varices.
On [**5-27**], she had a 1L BRB bleed via ostomy requiring an additional 2U PRBC and tamponade against liver via foley.
F/u US demonstrated resultant expected hepatopetal flow, but with elevated velocities to >200cm/sec.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] ran a low-grade temp while in the MICU, to 100.6 on [**5-27**], and then to 102.7F with rigors on [**5-28**] after her TIPS, with increased O2 requirements.
[**5-28**] CXR demonstrated a new RML and L retrocardiac infiltrate, c/w PNA or atelectasis.
She has been receiving finger sticks and being maintained on a diabetic diet for blood sugars elevated to 190s, possibly in setting of infection vs steroids.
She did have one transient episode of relative hypotension to SBP 70s on the morning of transfer, which responded well to 500mL LR.
Her baseline BBP is 90s, and she had no further episodes of hypotension below this level.
Once called out to the floor, a PA/Lateral CXR was done to better characterize opacities seen on AP film, which were read as more consistent with atelectasis.
