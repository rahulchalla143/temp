I suspect the etiology of the effusion was cardiac (valvular) + previous chest radiation.
Pleurex cath inserted in [**3-/2115**] for drainage at home; averages 550cc every other day.

Further imaging can be performed if indicated.
TTE [**2115-6-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2115-6-21**] 4:18 PM 1.
Her chest CT showed an increase of the right-sided pleural effusion, partially divided/organized in two major compartments.
Post-procedure CXRs showed continued right pleural effusion.
It also became quickly apparent to us that she was particularly preload dependent given her severe AS, which manifested as a prominent drop in SBPs with HRs >120s.
Her urine output remained adequate before and after these episodes of afib.
Her electrolytes were closely monitored and repleted PRN.
Her SBP was 70-80s requiring neosynephrine.
Her urine output for most of the morning was adequate at ~25cc per hour.
Urine electrolytes were sent which showed a FENA of 3%, not c/w a prerenal state.
Her creatinine bumped to 1.7.
Serial ABGs were obtained which showed a severe metabolic acidosis most likely caused by renal failure with a pH of 7.21, CO2 42 and HCO3 18.
Subsequent ABGs showed worsening acidosis.
Lactate was 13.8 and later trended upward to a max of 17.
Of note, her clinical exam was stable.
A urinalysis taken on [**6-22**] showed 6-10 WBCs with mod bacteria, but was believed to be contaminated given the presence of [**7-17**] epi cells.
Urine culture from that time eventually was negative.
Urinalysis from [**2115-6-23**] was also negative for infection.
A TTE showed elevated PCWP with a preserved EF>55%.
Post swan CXR showed appropriate line placement without new PTX.
The following plan for the evening was placed - obtain hemodynamic data, start CVVH to correct the metabolic acidosis, and cont vanc/zosyn.
Her abdominal exam was stable.
Hemodynamics were remarkable for a SVO2 60s, SVR >1300 (while on 3 of neo), PA pressures 60s/30s, wedge 28, mixed venous O2 50s, CO 2.4, fick CI 1.5.
She was relatively rate controlled for most of the evening with HR in the 110s, and SBP by aline in the 100-110s (neo of 3).
Her Hct was stable in the low 30s.
Bedside ultrasound was negative for a pericardial effusion.
Enoxaparin 60 mg/0.6 mL Syringe Sig: One (1) Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours): until INR 2.0 .
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Take  as directed to maintain INR 2.0-3.0 for L DVT.
