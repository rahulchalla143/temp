Prenatal labs included blood type A+, antibody negative, HBSAG negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, GBS unknown.
Fetal heart monitoring was not performed, although spot checks showed fetal heart rates to be in the 150s and reactive.
On the morning of delivery, there was noted to be a residual suture from the cerclage, and that was then removed.
The initial resuscitation was with positive-pressure ventilation, and the heart rate was initially 60-80.
Apgars were 2, 5 and 7.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The weight is 510 g, which is 10th-25th percentile, length is 28 cm, which is 10th- 25th percentile and the head circumference is 21 cm, which is 10th-25th percentile.
Vital signs: The temperature is 93.4 which quickly went up to 99 axillary, heart rate 160s, respiratory rate 40, blood pressure 27/23 with a mean of 25, shortly thereafter, 30s/20s with a mean of 27.
LABORATORY DATA:  Cord blood gas as delivery with arterial 7.15, CO2 of 59, venous 7.39, CO2 of 37.
Her maximum ventilator support thus far has been high frequency ventilation on day of life 16 with MAP of 10, amplitude of 20 and 70% FIO2.
At this present point in time, she is on high-frequency ventilation with a delta P of 13, mean airway pressure of 10 in approximately 50-70% FIO2 with stable blood gases, the most recent being 7.28, 53, 57, 26, -2 by ABG.
She had an echo on [**2141-12-4**], which showed no patent ductus but became symptomatic of a ductus with widening pulse pressures, bounding pulses and a murmur on [**2141-12-6**].
Follow-up echo on [**2141-12-8**], showed no PDA.
On day of life 14, which was [**2141-12-16**], a repeat echo was done which showed a small patent ductus arteriosus.
On [**2141-12-18**], follow-up echo showed a small to moderate PDA of 1.4 mm in size which was unchanged from the study on [**2141-12-16**].
Follow-up echocardiogram done on [**2141-12-21**], showed a small to moderate PDA that persisted, and that was after 3 courses of Indocin.
At this time her blood pressure and heart rate are fairly stable.
Heart rate in the 130s-160s, blood pressure 59/34 with a MAP of 42.
A UAC and UVC were placed.
She has had history of electrolyte instability, but at this point in time her electrolytes on [**2141-12-21**], are sodium 142, potassium of 3.3, chloride 104, CO2 of 24.
Electrolytes checked on [**12-22**] are Na=138/K=4.7/100/19.
She does have some edema, so we are basing her total fluids on a weight of 555  GI: Phototherapy was started on the newborn day.
Her peak bilirubin level was 2.7 on day of life 7, and she received a total of 10 days of phototherapy.
Hematology: On admission she presented with a hematocrit of 46.2.
She has had a total of 5 transfusions of packed red blood cells, and her most recent hematocrit is 32.3%, drawn on [**2141-12-21**].
Infectious disease: CBC and blood culture were drawn on admission.
The white count was 35.5 with 42 polys, 2 bands and 47 lymphocytes.
A lumbar puncture was done on [**2141-12-9**], day of life 7, which showed a white blood cell count of 45, red blood cells of [**Pager number **], protein of 126 and a glucose of 39.
A random level done at that time showed gentamicin to be 8.3.
She has had head ultrasounds done, the 1st one being on [**2141-12-3**], which was normal; on [**2141-12-6**], showed grade 2 on the left with a grade 1 on the right; on [**2141-12-7**], she had, also, a left grade 2 and a right grade 1; on [**2141-12-15**], she showed resolving hemorrhages, and that is her most recent head ultrasound.
Sensory: No hearing screen has been performed at this time.
No car seat testing has been done yet.
A repeat was sent on [**2141-12-17**], and that result is pending.
