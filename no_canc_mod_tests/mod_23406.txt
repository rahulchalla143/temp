At that time further evaluation was pursued with LFTs check and MRCP, which demonstrated severe biliary dilatation of the left lobe without definitive obstruction seen, as well as an altered T2-weighted signal in the perihilar region raising concerns for cholangiocarcinoma.
The procedure was uncomplicated and the patient was admitted to the medical floor for post-ERCP evaluation overnight.

Her blood culture came out to be positive for Klebsiella which had indeterminate sensitivity to zosyn, so zosyn was replaced with meropenum.On [**9-30**] She underwent an ECHO which showed mild LV dysfunction c/w PAD CAD.
She underwent a Cardiac Perfusion studu with Persantine which showed moderate partially reversible inferolateral wall perfusion defect and left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 41%.She was cleared by cardiology for future operative procedures.She was not able to ambulate without assistance and hence PT reccomended her to be discharged to rehab facility.
