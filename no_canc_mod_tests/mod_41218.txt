The week prior to her presentation her INR had been at goal of 2.0, she then noticed blood in her stool and red blood on the paper towel.
She called her PCP who checked an INR which was elevated to 8.0.
She went to [**Hospital3 635**] hospital where crit was 29.0 and INR was 6.1.
In the ED, initial VS were:  94 in sinus, 166/68, 20, 97% 3LNC Hematocrit was 24.0 and INR 2.5 .
Not on cardiac meds, follows with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13834**] in Tuscon AZ for management of her coumadin.

This study is not tailored to rule out tamponade.
A cardiac son[**Name (NI) **] is suggested.
If clinical concern of acute aortic process remains, a C+ exam is suggested.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2100-9-23**] IMPRESSION: Low-normal left ventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2100-9-22**], the current study is more complete.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2100-9-22**] FINDINGS:  There is moderate cardiomegaly, possible pericardial effusion, and a moderate left and small right pleural effusion.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2100-9-22**] IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Brief Hospital Course: #Pericardial Effusion:  A CXR done on admission noted a left pleural effusion.
A bedside thoracentesis was to be performed, however on ultrasound the heart was noted to be close to the wall.
A chest CT was done [**9-22**] which was remarkable for a small to moderate left effusion with a significant pericardial effusion and ascending thoracic aorta aneurysm.
An echo was performed [**9-22**] at the bedside due to concern for tamponade which showed probable moderate/severe aortic regurgitation with a a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp, moderate sized pericardial effusion without evidence of frank tamponade, although the right atrium does not fully dilate during atrial diastole, suggesting either low filling pressures or early tamponade.
A formal echo was performed on [**9-23**] dialted aortic root with probable small sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp and severe aortic regurgitaton, a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion without frank tamponade.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended CT with contrast due to concern for dissection; CT showed dissection of the thoracic ascending aorta with possible rupture into pericardium.
#Bright red blood per rectum: The patient present with bright red blood per rectum in the setting of an elevated INR of 8.0 and HCT of 29.0.
Her hematocrit dropped to 24.2.
The INR was corrected with 2 units FFP and 5 mg vitamin K x 2.
She did have a colonoscopy in [**2098**] that did not show any polyps, making malignancy unlikely.
The patient's hematocrit stabled and she had no further episodes of bleeding.
The CXR did not show any evidence of acute infection.
She was placed on nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation >92%.
They recommended monitoring vital capacity and negative inspiratory force.
Information was obtained from Patient.
