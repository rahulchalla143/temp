DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9987**] Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2189-8-10**]    PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: intraoperative TEE for AVR.TVR Height: (in) 74 Weight (lb): 327 BSA (m2): 2.68 m2 BP (mm Hg): 115/53 HR (bpm): 56 Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2189-8-10**] at 09:52 Test: TEE (Complete) Doppler: Limited Doppler and color Doppler Contrast: None Tape Number: 2007AW1-: Test Location: Anesthesia West OR cardiac Technical Quality: Suboptimal     REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: *7.5 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% to 45% (nl >=55%) Mitral Valve - Mean Gradient: 6 mm Hg Mitral Valve - Pressure Half Time: 125 ms Mitral Valve - MVA (P [**1-13**] T): 1.7 cm2 Tricuspid Valve - Mean TS Gradient: 9 mm Hg  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the RA.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
The peak systolic velocities bilaterally are normal as are the ICA to CCA ratios.
On [**8-10**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a Redo AVR/TVR (Mechanical) and replacement of her permenant A & V leads and generator.
CT brain showed large left MCA infarct, hyperdense left MCA sign present, mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle, several mm of subfalcine herniation to the right and mild uncal and hippocampal herniation, and no bleed or atrophy.
Neurology was consulted and recommended serial neuro exams and CT scans, MR brain, SBP 120-160, HOB > 30 degrees andcarotid ultrasound.
Carotid ultrasound showed no significant stenosis, but no end diastolic flow in the left CCA&ICA.
His neurological exam continued to deteriorate.
