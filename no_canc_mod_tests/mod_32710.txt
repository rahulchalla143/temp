ARF resolved prior to transfer to medical floor and further Renal follow-up was not recommended.
Potassium stabilized with resolution of ARF.
HCT remained stable and this was not pursued further while in the ICU.
On morning of [**2122-4-5**] CXR revealed a multilobar pneumonia.
Plan at that time was to only cover pseudomonas if sputum cultures grew pseudomonas, if patient did not defervesce within two days, or if patient had acute worsening.
On morning of [**4-6**], single blood culture from [**4-5**] returned positive for gram positive cocci and later speciated as an MSSA on [**4-8**].
Patient's pulmonary exam normalized on [**2122-4-9**] with no residual abnormal findings.
At time of discharge, a blood culture from [**4-5**] and two blood cultures from [**4-6**] were still pending and will need to be followed to finality.
No culture of exudate was able to be obtained due to insufficient volume.
HCT was measured daily through [**2122-4-7**] (nadir of 24.7 on [**2122-4-3**]) and found to be stable (and trending upward slightly) with final measured HCT of 29.4 on afternoon of [**2122-4-7**].
Iron of 8 and iron sat of 2.9% from [**2122-4-3**] indicated iron deficiency anemia.
She is medically stable from anemia standpoint and any further follow-up can be done as an outpatient.
Sinus Tachycardia: On presentation from MICU, heart rate was ranging from 100 to 140s when patient ambulatory.
Some consideration given to benzodiazepine withdrawal; however, heart rate not significantly responsive to low dose benzos.
