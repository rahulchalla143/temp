HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Sixty-year old female with history of CAD status post CABG, end-stage CHF on chronic dopamine, status post biventricular pacer with an EF of 20%, a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**11/2127**] and diabetes mellitus.
On arrival to ED, noted to be hypotensive with blood pressures of 40s/20s.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature was 101, her T max and her T current was 99.7 on admission.
Her blood pressure was 63/33 on admission to CCU.
Her pulse was 80.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities:  Cool extremities, unable to palpate dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cells 3.0, hematocrit 29.3, platelets 150.
Sodium 131, potassium 5.3, chloride 96, bicarb 20, BUN 71, creatinine 2.9, and glucose 80.
Albumin 3.7, calcium 8.7, magnesium 1.8, phosphorus 5.3, INR 4.0, and PTT of 39.1.
ALT of 77, LDH 27, alkaline phosphatase 189, AST 71.
CK 318.
Total bilirubin 1.6, and lipase 27.
EKG was AV sequentially paced, left bundle branch block, rate 81, normal QRS axis, no ST-T wave changes.
Dopamine drips were increased with a titration goal given a systolic blood pressures of greater than 60 with IV boluses and dopamine drip.
Her picture was most likely a mix between a cardiogenic component and a distributive secondary to sepsis.
Her fevers were likely secondary to infection of the Hickman based on previous admission.
On admission, she was started on empirical Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl to cover the GI scan and Clostridium difficile, and she was added for stool studies.
Her Coumadin was held at the time because she was supertherapeutic, INR of 4.0.
Her goal INR is 2.5.
On her discharge, according to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her goal INR has changed, now between 2-2.5 given that she has a valve.
They also recommended repeat blood cultures x2 and labeled the site of the specimens, which was done when she was admitted.
They also said that if blood cultures from [**8-6**] show Stenotrophomonas, would consider transesophageal echocardiogram, and would consider removing her Hickman catheter.
Her blood pressures with dopamine drip was much improved by [**8-8**], and she was back to her home IV dose of 8 mcg/kg/minute, which she continued to be on that dose until discharge date.
On [**8-9**], ID suggested to continue levofloxacin, and also because the blood cultures also grew budding yeast.
with close [**Month/Year (2) 7941**] of INR because of the interaction of fluconazole with Coumadin.
Though her blood cultures from the previous gram-negative rods actually grew Klebsiella, she was continued on levofloxacin to cover the Klebsiella, which was sensitive to levofloxacin.
On discharge date, patient since [**8-11**], since being on the triple antibiotics and the antifungal, the patient's blood cultures have been negative to date.
If blood sterilization is not accomplished, the Hickman line may in future need to  per Surgery's continued involvement balancing high risk / benefit.
Dopamine drip to titrate to systolic blood pressure over 60-80.
Warfarin 2.5 mg with close followup INR checks, first INR check should be on this Monday when VNA comes in and the INR, potassium and Vancomycin levels should be faxed to [**Hospital **] Clinic as directed.
Fluconazole, Vancomycin, and levofloxacin are to be taken for the next 14 days.
