CT scan from OSH was obtained and KUB was obtained here, both of which were consistent with a cecal volvulus.
On [**2165-5-23**] the patient began to have O2 sats in the upper 80's on 3LO2 and was sent for a CT to rule out a PE.
The CT was negative for a PE but showed increased consolidation in the lungs.
She failed her initial speecha and swallow examination, but a repeat video swallow study on [**2165-5-27**] indicated that the patient would be able to take pureed foods and thin liquids.
