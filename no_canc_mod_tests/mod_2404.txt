# DISCHARGE LABS  # PERTINENT STUDIES - [**7-28**] CXR portable The lungs are well expanded and clear.
- [**7-29**] CXR portable Aortic valve endograft projects over the anticipated location.
- [**7-29**] ECHO Conclusions Preimplantation: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
- [**7-31**] ECHO Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
TTE ([**2160-8-4**]) The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-7-31**], the findings are similar (severity of mitral regurgitation was underestimated on the prior study).
Post-op echo showed 1+ MR, 1+ paravalvular aortic regurgitation, LVH, LVEF 55%.
- ECHO at one week post-op showed similar findings with minimal AR.
