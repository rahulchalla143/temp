Physical exam was positive for elevated JVD and lower extremity edema.
Labs were significant for Na 122, Cr 0.2, Lactate 0.8, UA positive for [**10-2**] WBC and many bacteria.
CXR was concerning for a right middle lobe infiltrate.
Vital signs prior to transfer to the ICU were HR 124 BP 121/52 (on 0.25 levophed) RR 17 SpO2 97% NRB.
Her baseline blood pressures range from 101-118/66-70.

[**2178-8-22**] CXR: Limited study due to lack of lateral view and patient's positioning.
Limited study by motion artifacts, but no evidence of hemorrhage.
[**2178-8-23**] CHEST CT: 1.
Moderate-to-large right and moderate left simple-appearing pleural effusions with intrafissural fluid on the right.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2178-8-27**] MRI C/T SPINE: 1.
An abnormal cardiogram was noted intermittently.

Her ABG revealed hypercarbia of pCO2 79.
She is without any known chronic lung disease, though recent labs from [**2178-8-20**] did show HCO3 of 38 suggesting this may be a chronic process.
Albumin was 3.0 on admission.
She had a swallow evaluation on [**2178-8-25**] which showed no overt signs of aspiration.
She had a PEG placed on [**9-9**] without complication and tube feeds were running at goal.
Blood cultures were negative.
UA showed [**11-2**] WBC but was negative for LE and nitrites and urine culture returned negative.
Transthoracic echo from [**2178-8-25**] showed EF 55% with no wall motion abnormalities and minimal valvular disease, suggesting against cardiogenic source for hypotension.
She ulitmately was c. diff positive ([**9-5**]) which likely explains her sepsis.
She was treated for severe c/ diff with iv flagyl and po vancomycin (day 1 = [**9-5**]) for a total of 2 weeks.
Her family was concerned her wishes to be DNR/DNI and her refusal for a feeding tube, which were both expressed to mulitple housestaff and nurses, were the result of her depression and that these are not her true wishes.
TSH was checked and was 0.68.
Her blood pressure tends to drop with this dose, so she often required a 500cc fluid bolus after AM metoprolol.
Would hold metoprolol if systolic BP<100.
