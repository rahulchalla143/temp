Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited hemodynamics revealed centralized systolic normotension.
Please note to evaluate for an arterial graft, a dedicated study must be ordered through the [**Date Range 1106**] lab.

She underwent PTCA [**3-20**] which revealed diffuse RCA disease with 95% mid-distal lesion.
On presentation, she had normal cardiac enzymes and no ecg changes.
Stress MIBI showed new partially reversible inferior wall mild perfusion defect.
Cardiac enzymes were followed to peak.
On this admission, PE was ruled out by CTA.
Coumadin was stopped and coags trended until INR normalized.
