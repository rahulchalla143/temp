Cardiac cath revealed 2V disease, now s/p CABG on [**2145-6-16**].
MRI revealed left MCA parietal infarct.
An informal assessment was completed at the bedside.
She had difficulty [**Location (un) 1131**] the time off of a clock, but was able to self correct on the third attempt.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
LVEF 50% There is still some mild hypokinesis of the distal/apical portion of the anterior and anteroseptal walls.
Remaining exam is unchanged.
Cardiac catheterization was significant for a severe 90% ostial lesion in left anterior descending artery along with a 70% stenosis in the diagonal branch(see result section for additional detail).
Given concern for possible ischemic bowel via embolization during cardiac catheterization, an abdominal CT scan was obtained.
CT scan was essentially negative for any intra-abdominal pathology.
Carotid ultrasound showed no significant disease on the internal carotid arteries.
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an LVEF of 40% with 1-2+ mitral regurgitation.
She had a head CTA which was negative for a bleed or infarct and then had an MRI which revealed a R parietal infarct.
Her symptoms improved over the next 48 hours and neurology recommended ASA and statins.
