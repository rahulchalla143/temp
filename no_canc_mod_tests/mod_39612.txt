A 2D-Echo was performed and showed 3+ mitral regurgitation with an LVEF of 15-20%.
His weight on admission was 97 kg (dry weight estimated at 90 kg) and this improved to 89.8 kg at discharge.
In terms of cardiomyopathy investigation - his HIV, Lyme antibody, CMV, EBV, hepatitis serologies, TSH and [**Location (un) **] virus testing were all negative.
Additions to his medication list at that time included an ACEI, beta-blocker and spironolactone.
His exam was notable for tachypnea, tachycardia, but no leg swelling or JVP elevation.
His WBC was 21.1 (N 82.9%, L 10.3%), pro-BNP 2968, Troponin < 0.01.
CTA chest showed small, LLL subsegmental pulmonary embolus with possible right lung base PNA.
Prior to transfer, VS 97.7 100 99/72 22 100% intubated (500/22/5/1.0).
They continued Vancomycin, Cefepime and Levofloxacin for presumed healthcare-associated pneumonia given CT findings of right lung base consolidation.
He spiked a temperature to 101.5F, developed tachycardia to the 120s and had a repeat 2D-Echo on [**11-14**] showing right ventricular systolic function that was more severely impaired when compared to the [**10-31**] study.
A RUQ ultrasound showed prominent hepatic veins, mild distention of the gallbladder with mild wall thickening and no gallstones.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-10-31**], right ventricular systolic function is now more severely impaired.
[**2185-10-19**] CARDIAC MR IMAGING - Severely increased left ventricular cavity size with severe global dysfunction.
[**2185-11-12**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON - Pulmonary emboli within subsegmental branches of the left and right lower lobe pulmonary arteries.
He was noted to have decompensated dilated cardiomyopathy with a 2D-Echo showing 3+ mitral regurgitation with an LVEF of 15-20%.
Etiologies for his cardiomyopathy included: ischemic (unlikely given age and no risk factors; no cardiac cath data) vs. infectious (HIV, Lyme, viral, Chagas - last admission his HIV, Lyme antibody, CMV, EBV, hepatitis serologies, TSH and [**Location (un) **] virus testing were all negative) vs. toxic (alcohol, cocaine, medications - unlikely given no prior medication; prior toxicology screens negative, although moderate alcohol intake was noted) vs. familial (most likely possibility given strong family history noted above; genetic vs. autoimmunity-related).
A repeat 2D-Echo ([**11-15**]) showed right ventricular systolic dysfunction that was now more severely impaired.
Simultaneously, he was started on a continuous IV Lasix infusion at 5-7 mg/hr and together with the inotropic effect of Milrinone, he diuresed roughly 6-8L of fluid to a weight of 90.2 kg (95 kg on admission; dry weight 89.8 kg).
We trended his transaminitis and monitored his abdominal pain, which both steadily improved with diuresis.
His ACEI (Lisinopril) and Spironolactone therapy were held in the setting of acute heart failure, but his Metoprolol was titrated back at 12.5 mg by mouth twice daily; we also continued his Digoxin therapy.
A 2D-Echo showed right ventricular failure and right atrial dilatation with acute [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular failure; but it is unlikely that a distal, subsegmental PE induced right ventricular failure, but this should be considered.
EKG was without evidence of poor R-wave progression; and he maintained his oxygen saturations.
He was started on Coumadin 5 mg PO daily and his dose was titrated to an INR of [**1-20**].
He was found to have right lower lobe consolidation on CT imaging.
His U/A was reassuring and blood, urine cultures were negative.
# CORONARIES - He has no evidence of ischemic cardiomyopathy or coronary disease; no prior cardiac catheterizations; no HTN, smoking history or strong atherosclerotic family history (only familial NICM history) - presented with some atypical chest pain symptoms - but now pain free - Troponin < 0.01 x 2-sets with reassuring EKG showing only sinus tachycardia and no ST-changes on admission.
He has no indication for Aspirin - [**Location (un) 47**] risk score calculates to 10-year risk of 1% - given HDL 44, cholesterol 167, age < 20, male, no smoking history and no indication for statin at this time.
He was monitored with serial EKGs.
Pulmonary embolism 4.
* Upon admission, we ADDED: You are being TRANSFERRED ON: Milrinone 0.25 mcg/kg/min IV continuous infusion (maximum dosing 0.5 mcg/min); lasix drip titrated to urine output 100cc/hour; cefepime, vancomycin and levofloxacin.
Monitor your INR and restart warfarin when your INR is no longer supratherapeutic at 3.3 (ideal range is [**1-20**]).
