In early [**Month (only) 956**] she was treated medically for an ileus which improved w/ time and NPO.
After transient hypotension, she was admitted to the ICU where her pressures improved after volume resussitation and transfusion of 2 units of pRBC.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis during this hospitalization demonstrated again a small bowel obstruction with a transition point approximately in distal ileum presumed from adhesions.
The SBO appeared worse than similar CT scan several weeks prior.
The stools are soft, light brown, and no blood.
In the ED, patient triggered for hypotension with initial VS HR100 SBP 87/69, which resolved without intervention.
Labs were significant for creatinine 1.7 (baseline 1.0), mild transaminitis, Tbili at baseline, lactate 2.0.
A diagnostic paracentesis was attempted by no ultrasound windows were visualized.
Vitals on transfer were: 97.9 85 102/78 14 99%RA.
On arrival to the floor, vital signs were 97.8 102/74 80 20 100%RA.
Patient reported abdominal pain, improved from prior, similar to prior admissions.
