Pt went to OSH ED and EKG showed up to 2-mm STD in V1-3, Q and TWI in III.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his vitals were stable and he had [**12-16**] chest pain.
Pt currently c/o continued chest discomfort, which he desribes as a [**1-16**] "pressure."
PCP/Cardiologist- [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 29069**] [**Doctor Last Name 29070**] ([**Hospital1 3597**], NH) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37284**] has done stress and cath within the last several years.
Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: T 98.6 BP 136/84 HR 72 RR 18 O2 96% 3L NC Gen: NAD, comfortable, pleasant HEENT: PERRL.
Cardiac Cath [**11-30**]: Initial angiiogram demonstrateda 50% stenosis of the proximal LCx and a subsequent 90% stenosis.
Integrelin was the anticoagulant used during the procedure.
The lesion was pre-dilated with a 2.25 x 15 Quantum Maverick balloon at 10 ATM, a 2.5 x 20 Taxus DES was deployed across the lesion at 14 ATM and post dilated with a 2.75 Quantum Maverick at 20 ATM distally and proximally.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis and no angiographic evidence of dissection, thrombus or perforation with TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-11-30**], there is no definite change.
[**12-2**] CXR: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2150-12-1**]: Patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting.
