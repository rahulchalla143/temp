Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Head CT [**2167-8-14**]:  FINDINGS: Compared to a prior CT examination there is no longer midline shift.
Head CT [**2167-8-16**]: There is no new hemorrhage, no new focus of edema, and there remains no significant shift of normally midline structures.
Head CT showed increased extra-axial fluid with 10mm MLS and subfalcine herniation.
On [**8-13**] pt [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a L craniotomy evacuation of epidural and subdural collection.
Post-op CT midline shift much improved.
The subdural drain was DC'd [**8-15**], Subgaleal drain DC'd [**8-16**].
On [**8-16**] pt had repeat head CT for disorientation and R pupil seemed slightly bigger than L, though not consistent.
CT was stable and he was transferred to SDU on [**2167-8-17**].
