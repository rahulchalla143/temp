IMAGING CT sinus [**12-14**] 1.
CT head wo contrast [**12-14**] Small, focal area of mixed hypo- and hyperattenuation within the right frontal lobe adjacent to the skull, most consistent with a small hemorrhagic contusion.
CXR [**12-14**] Question subtle focal opacity projecting at the lung apex.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2173-12-15**] 10:08 AM IMPRESSION: No significant change since the previous study or evidence of progression of edema or worsening mass effect.
ECHO [**12-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
ECG Study Date of [**2173-12-15**]  7:41:32 AM Sinus bradycardia.
ECG Study Date of [**2173-12-14**]  7:33:30 PM Sinus bradycardia.
Compared to tracing #2 atrial fibrillation is no longer present.
ECG Study Date of [**2173-12-14**]  2:47:28 PM Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 101.
ECG Study Date of [**2173-12-14**]  1:41:50 PM Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
EEG Study Date of [**2173-12-16**] IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in the waking and drowsy states.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4643**] is a 63 y/o male w/ prodrome, syncope, question of possible seizure, tranferred to ED found to be hypertensive, in afib w/ RVR, noted to have nasal laceration, small right frontal lobe hemorragic contusion on CT head.
Confusion would fit w/ post ictal state, pt did not lose control of bladder or bowel.
Given he had no heart failure by ECHO and his [**Country **] score is 1, he was not anticoagulated.
TSH was normal.
#Head Trauma: Brain contusion on Head CT.  Repeat CT showed no change.
EKG changes (ST depression) resolved with control of RVR.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Pt noted to have Cr of 1.2 on admit, OSH labs from [**2169**] note Cr 1.1. .
SBP documented as in 180s in ED.
OSH records show no RAS in [**2169**] on angiogram.
Shoulder xray showed no fractures/dislocations but showed degenerative changes of the AC joint.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) for 4 days: Through [**2173-12-20**].
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day for 1 days: Take for one day on [**2173-12-21**].
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: [**11-17**] Capsule PO twice a day for 1 days: For only one day on [**2173-12-22**].
A head CT showed a brain contusion, which was stable on repeat head CT.  You were found to be in a rhythm called atrial fibrillation, which reverted back to a normal rhythm.
You also had an ECHO cardiogram, which showed essentially normal heart function, therefore, you will not need a blood thinner.
You also had an EEG, which showed normal brain function.
