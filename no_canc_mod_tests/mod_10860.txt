CT/CTA Head/neck [**2138-3-16**]: No change in the left cerebellar infarct compared with the previous CT of the [**Hospital3 628**].
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates approximately 50-60% stenosis at the right carotid bifurcation with exuberant calcification.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of occlusion or  stenosis or filling defect in the posterior circulation arteries.
MRI [**2138-3-17**]: Subacute infarction involving the left cerebellar hemisphere and left superior cerebellar peduncle.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2137-4-21**] the ventricular rate is increased and atrial ectopy is now seen.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 89 154 90 376/426 58 -27 126  Cerebral angiogram [**2138-3-19**]:  Left vertebral artery arteriogram shows widely patent left vertebral artery.
GROIN U/S [**2138-3-19**]: 2.5 cm right groin hematoma without evidence of pseudoaneurysm or fistula.
CXR [**2138-3-20**]: Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and accompanied by mild pulmonary [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] engorgement, new perihilar haziness and more confluent opacities at the bases, accompanied by small effusions.
At this OSH, she received a NCHCT which revealed a left cerebellar hypodensity of unknown chronicity.
Her CTA on admission showed the presence of cerebrovascular atherosclerosis which was expected given her history of [**Hospital1 1106**] risk factors.
Initial labs showed the presence of a urinary tract infection, later speciated as E coli.
The MRI showed evidence of restricted diffusion in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Her examination remained largely stable; her level of awareness would often fluctuate in a manner that was consistent with her history of anoxic brain damage (at the time of prior AAA repair).
Her LDL returned at 160, A1c at 13.9.
Her blood sugars as expected were difficult to control, and in conjunction with the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes service, we were able to obtain better control of her blood sugars using sliding scale and scheduled insulin.
They scheduled her for a repeat angiogram with possible stent/coiling on [**2138-3-19**] and she was loaded with plavix.
Unfortunately, the angiogram was not successful.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please be sure to have Ms. [**Known lastname **] meet all of her follow up appointments, including her follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from the Department of Neurosurgery - She requires anticoagulation as secondary prophylaxis against strokes.
- Her blood counts have been stable thus far, please measure daily CBCs so as to ensure that her h/H remains stable (following her right groin hematoma).
We also measured various laboratory tests and we found that your diabetes and elevated cholesterol were elevated to dangerous levels.
You received an angiogram in an attempt to fix your basilar artery aneurysm.
You will remain on aspirin until your blood tests reveal that WARFARIN is acting appropriately.
