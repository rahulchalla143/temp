There are air bronchograms evident in the right lower lung; however, this may be related to either compressive atelectasis or pneumonia  CT Abdomen: 1.
CT Chest: 1.
Pertinent labs on discharge: Hemoglobin 7.5 Hct 22.6.
Final urine culture on [**2180-4-11**] was negative for growth.
Urine legionella antigen was positive and antibiotics were narrowed to levofloxacin.
His WBC count continued to rise, infectious disease was consulted and coverage was broadened to tigecycline on [**2180-3-31**].
His white count trended down to 12 on transfer to the floor.
# Cardiac Arrest: On [**2180-4-3**] patient was extubated, became acutely hypoxic and suffered PEA arrest.
Chest compressions were started promptly, he received epinephrine, atropine and received one electrical defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation.
His rate was stable in the 80s.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: On arrival patient had increased BUN and creatinine (4.5 -> 8.8) from baseline, mild hyperkalemia (5.7) and metabolic acidosis.
As his platelets trended down from 267 to 110, there was concern for HIT.
Once his INR was > 2.0, argatroban was stopped.
INR was initially therapeutic on 4 mg warfarin, but then became supratherapeutic.
He will require INR checks on [**2180-4-14**] and [**2180-4-17**] with further adjustments as needed.
His blood pressures have been very stable on his current dose of diltiazem, which may be titrated up if his heart rate persists above 90s.
# Abdominal Pain:  Patient had tenderness to palpation of the abdomen on exam.
Given rising white count and question of perinephric fluid collection on the outside CT, an abdominal ultrasound was performed that were unremarkable.
DM2: Fingerstick blood glucose was checked daily.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **] will need to arrange for regular INR checks while on warfarin after discharge.
- Patient will need INR monitored tomorrow and Monday and warfarin dose adjusted accordingly.
- Patient will need to be monitored for heart rate control (diltiazem may be increased as needed).
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 4. warfarin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: PLEASE HOLD TODAY [**2180-4-13**] for INR of 4.6.
This will require following INR on a regular basis.
- BEGIN TAKING diltiazem 30 mg PO every 6 hours for heart rate control (your doctor may wish to change you to a once-daily formula once you are stable on this regimen) - BEGIN TAKING warfarin 2.5 mg PO daily (your doctor will need to monitor your INR and may need to adjust your dose) - BEGIN TAKING Phos-Lo to control your phosphate levels (total 4 tablets daily or as directed by your nephrologist) - BEGIN TAKING aspirin 81 mg PO daily - TAKE AS NEEDED acetaminophen for fever or pain - COMPLETE COURSE of levofloxacin (antibiotic) for your pneumonia (3 more doses over 6 days)  Please continue to take your medications as prescribed.
You will also need to have your INR monitored regularly while on anticoagulation therapy with warfarin.
You will need to follow up with a nephrologist at discharge from rehab (either your prior nephrologist or a new provider) to monitor your kidney function and need for dialysis.
