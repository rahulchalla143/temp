GENERAL:  DIABETIC FOOT CARE:  Diabetes is a disease in which high blood glucose levels over time can damage the nerves, kidneys, eyes, and blood vessels.
Damage to blood vessels and impairment of the immune system from diabetes makes it difficult to heal these wounds.
Although treatment for diabetic foot problems has improved, prevention, including good control over blood sugar, remains the best way to prevent problems.
If you have common foot abnormalities such as flat feet, bunions, or hammertoes, you may need prescription shoes or shoe inserts.
A diabetic may not be able to perceive a stone.
Cut them straight across and leave plenty of room out from the nailbed or quick.
If you have flat feet, bunions, or hammertoes, you may need prescription shoes or shoe inserts.
Smoking accelerates damage to blood vessels, especially small blood vessels leading to poor circulation, which is a major risk factor for foot infections and ultimately amputations.
Consistent long-term blood sugar control to near normal levels can greatly lower the risk of damage to your nerves, kidneys, eyes, and blood vessels.
Fever, defined as a temperature greater than 98.6?????
It may also be a sign of either very high or very low blood sugars, which are more common when there is infection present.
On Dc your INR is 2.1.
