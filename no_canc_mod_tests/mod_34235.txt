Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 78277**] was evaluated in the ER by the Trauma Service and Ct scans of the C Spine, Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis were notable for multiple rib fractures and an old L1 compression fracture.
He had carotid studies which showed a string sign on the right and 70-79% occlusion of the left internal carotid artery.
The vascular surgery service was consulted and recommended an MRA of the neck however this was not obtained as the family felt that surgery was not an option due to his age and comorbidities.
A chest Xray revealed a left lower lobe density and he was placed on IV Vancomycin and Zosyn.
His cultures were negative but the antibiotic was for Xray findings.
