In the setting of IV steroids, patient developed high blood sugars with a anion gap of 12 and was started on an insulin drip, discharged with a rate of 9u/hr.
Upon arrival to the floor he was tachycardic rates 120s and normotensive, oxygenation 100% 3L NC.
ECG today shows ST depressions in lateral and inferior leads unchanged from outside hospital.

Blood Culture, Routine : NO GROWTH .
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2132-10-25**]):       [**12-8**] PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2132-10-27**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2132-10-24**] 9:14 PM FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2132-10-22**].
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2132-10-27**] at 11:35:11 AM      FINAL  Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
ECG Study Date of [**2132-10-27**]  8:17:20 AM Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2132-10-26**] no diagnostic interim change.

Would recommend abdominal CT for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
ECHO [**2132-10-31**]: There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
ECHO showed overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Debate was had regarding whether or not pt should go to surgery for valve replacement which would provide a more durable treatment vs valvulplasty which would allow for quicker recovery.
Urine legionella was negative.
Sputum culture, blood cultures, and urine cultures were negative.
Repeat CXR showed resolving infiltrate, and by the day of discharge his cough and shortness of breath were markedly improved.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Known moderate diffuse disease including diagonals and OM2; 80% stenosis of the proximal RCA.
# Paroxsymal atrial fibrillation: The patient had episode of atrial fibrillation/flutter with HR 120-140s.
IV Lopressor was given without much effect, followed by IV diltiazem which slowed his rate and he had spontaneous conversion to sinus.
His beta blocker was held secondary to HR 50-60s, but can be restarted if amiodarone is stopped as an outpatient by his cardiologist.
His INR was subtherapeutic at discharge, but given that he remained in sinus, we did not discharge him on a lovenox bridge.
He was instructed to have an INR checked in 2 days on [**2132-11-4**] and have the results faxed to his PCP.
