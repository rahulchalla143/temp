Last ECHO (post op in '[**31**]) had an EF of 40%.
Labs demonstrated HCT of 35, a Troponin I of 0.08 with a BNP of 808 and a normal WBC count of 6.8.
CXR demonstrated mild cardiac enlargement and mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup of her aneurysm.
In house, her CXR confirmed mild pulmonary edema, and BNP was 2300.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the previous study of [**2132-9-29**], left ventricular systolic function has deteriorated.
Left ventriculography was deferred due to high filling pressures.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP=51 mmHg and mean PCWP=42 mmHg.
Pulmonary artery pressures were elevated with PASP=75 mmHg.
The cardiac output was depressed with CI=1.7 L/min/m2.
CTA Chest/Abd/Pelvis: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is an aortic dissection, which extends from the region of the junction of the ascending aorta and aortic arch and extends inferiorly down to the iliac bifurcation.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands are unremarkable on this single phase of contrast study.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Stranding is identified within the right groin consistent with recent catheterization.
CT Head: FINDINGS: No evidence of hemorrhage.
CT C-spine: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intraspinal or soft tissue hemorrhage within the neck.
Mild degenerative changes are noted within the cervical spine with endplate changes and osteophyte formation seen at the C4-5 and C5-6 levels.
CT does not provide intrathecal detail comparable to MR; however, the thecal sac appears grossly intact.

Recs: -Soft cervical collar and hard pillow qHS -NSAIDs or other antiinflammatory for pain relief in place of narcotics -Continue Valium (try 2 mg tid standing as not as sedating) or can substitue Skelaxin 800 mg po tid or Flexeril 5-10 mg po tid for neck spasm -CT C spine to rule out acute disc herniation -Heat and/or massage to the neck might be helpful -If there remains concern for aneurysm and subarachnoid bleed, CTA of the head is reportedly 95% sensitive for this but would not be able to rule it out completely   Brief Hospital Course: # Ischemia: Had cardiac catheterization to r/o ischemic etiology of CHF, which demonstrated clean coronaries.
Non-ischemic etiologies of CHF pursued: TSH 4.3 with FT4 1.1, Fe studies c/w iron-deficiency.
Had TTE [**5-11**], confirming EF 25% with no evidence of AI.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6818**] also had markedly elevated right-sided pressures on cardiac cath, with PCWP 42, and was aggressively diuresed for several days.
CTA was done, which confirmed aortic dissection extending to level of iliac bifurcation distally (see above for details).
Maintained on heparin bridge to coumadin with INR goal 2.5-3.5.
INR at time of d/c was 3.3.
She was instructed to hold her coumadin for 1 day, then restart, and to follow up on [**5-24**] to have her INR rechecked.
A head and neck CT demonstrated no evidence of bleeding, and had no neurological findings suggestive of SAH.
Please see your Doctor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7661**] on Mon [**5-24**] to have your INR (coumadin level) checked.
Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 56849**],[**Name11 (NameIs) **]  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 56850**]  Follow-up appointment should be in 1 week for a blood pressure check and to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and digoxin level.
