The patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] where he was noted to have electrocardiogram changes.
He was started on aspirin, heparin, and metoprolol and transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was afebrile, his blood pressure was 159/79, his heart rate was 68, his respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was 96 percent on room air.
In general,  a well-appearing elderly male lying in bed after his cardiac catheterization in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremities revealed 2 plus dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 11.3, his hematocrit was 49.1, and his platelets were 316.
His INR was 0.94.  sodium was 136, potassium was 3.3, chloride was 94, bicarbonate was 32, blood urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 1.2, and his blood glucose was 226.
His troponin was 0.05.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram initially revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 66 beats per minute with a left bundle branch block.
Subsequent electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 51 beats per minute with a left bundle branch block as well as 9-mm ST elevations in V2 through V3 and 5-mm ST elevations in V1 and V4.
Cardiac catheterization - on [**2170-6-14**] - revealed there was a 100 percent mid left anterior descending lesion after the second diagonal; status post three stents (two Taxus/one Pixel), dilated distal third diagonal with residual 60 percent stenosis.
Hemodynamics were significant for a right atrial pressure of 9, right ventricular pressure of 40/4, pulmonary artery pressure of 40/18, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, cardiac output of 2.85, and a cardiac index of 1.57.
The patient cardiac catheterization revealed a 100 percent mid left anterior descending lesion that was stented with three stents.
The patient was also started on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor; the doses of which were titrated up as tolerated by his blood pressure and heart rate.
The patient was evaluated with an echocardiogram on the day following admission which revealed an ejection fraction of 30 percent and apical akinesis.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  As noted previously, the    patient had an echocardiogram on hospital day two that    revealed an ejection fraction of 30 percent with extensive    apical akinesis.
An evaluation    of the rhythm strip demonstrated atrial fibrillation    alternating with atrial flutter.
Ejection fraction of 30 percent with apical akinesis.
The patient was to have his blood drawn on the day after discharge - on [**2170-6-18**] - to check his INR.
The patient was encouraged to discuss his elevated blood sugars with his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] we recommend that his fasting blood sugar checked once he is discharged.
