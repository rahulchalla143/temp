The patient was fully evaluated in the trauma bay, with a CT scan of the head showing a small subdural hematoma and frontoparietal hemorrhage.
A CT scan of the abdomen showed a grade IV liver laceration with blood around the liver and in the pelvis.
A CT scan of the neck was initially concerning for C1-2 injury, subsequently ruled out.
A CT scan of the abdomen saw a left lower lobe infiltrate versus aspiration.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils 2 mm, equal and reactive, mid-face stable, endotracheal tube in place, left upper lip laceration, no head or scalp lacerations.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with chest wall intact.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 27.3, hematocrit 32.1, platelet count 281,000, prothrombin time 15.4, partial thromboplastin time 58, INR 1.6, fibrinogen 116.5, amylase 66, sodium 143, potassium 3.5, chloride 110, bicarbonate 18, BUN 18, creatinine 1 and blood sugar 301 and lactate 5.7.
Alcohol level was 187.
CT scan of the head showed a small right subdural hematoma.
CT of the abdomen showed left lower lobe developing infiltrate, questionable aspiration, liver laceration grade IV with blood around the liver and pelvis, right back hematoma.
CT of the neck could not rule out C1-2 atlantoaxial injury initially; further evaluated to be negative.
A trauma ultrasound was performed and suggested fluid in [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch.
The patient went for a CT scan to rule out intra-abdominal injury, at which point it was felt there was no injury and the patient could go to the Operating Room for fixation of the right femur.
A systolic blood pressure of less than 140 was desirable.
The patient was loaded on Dilantin with a repeat head CT in 24 hours showing no progression of bleeds.
It was also desirable to keep the INR below 1.7.
He received two units of blood for a hematocrit of 23.
Liver function tests, TSH, T4, B12 and folate were all evaluated.
