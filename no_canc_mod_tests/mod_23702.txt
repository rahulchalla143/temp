Echocardiogram ([**2175-10-5**]): Conclusions Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  45% to 50% The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Cardiac Catheterization report was pending at the time of discharge.
Persantine MIBI on [**2175-9-26**] at [**Hospital3 1280**] showed moderate sized septal infarct and anteroseptal and apical ischemia.
Cardiac catheterization revealed 1 vessel disease with 90% stenosis of the LAD, complicated by dissection of the LAD during intervention.
Her enzymes were trended with a slight bump associated with the dissection.
She had an echo that showed a depressed EF to 45-50% and evidence of septal wall infarct.
We did not start an ACEI out of concern for her kidney function with a high contrast load.
Her EKGs were unchanged with a sinus rhythm and LBBB with elevated j points, but no changes after catheterization.
Cardiac enzymes were trended and had a slight expected increase in troponins.
Repeat EKGs were unchanged from prior.
Her creatinine was at 0.7 on discharge.
We will have her get labs drawn Monday to make sure her renal function is stable.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a cardiac catheterization to fix a blockage in one of the arteries in your heart.
