The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course as narrated according to [**Last Name **] problem list is as follows:  # Rapid onset weakness: Quickly progressive over the last 48 hours involving the toes to the T2 level, with a lumbar puncture significant for greater than 350 WBCs (see above).
That said, despite positivity for anti-Ro and anti-[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 32545**] detected earlier on a reflex rheumatologic panel, her constellation of symptoms does not conform to a diagnosis of Sjogren's or any other rheumatologic disorder.
An LP and brain MRI were performed, with results above.
Her neurological examination improved initially but then plateaued, with a persisting T2 sensory level and weakness in the lower extremities with the left worse than the right and the proximal muscles worse than the distal muscles.
The patient was transferred from medicine to neurology service for further work-up and management.
After the third of these treatments, a repeat lumbar puncture suggested improvement in the inflammation with only 1 WBC detected.
Following the final round of plasmapheresis treatment, the neurological exam was only minimally improved, with motor exam showing LLE iliopsoas [**12-4**], quad [**2-1**], ham [**1-4**], tibialis anterior [**3-4**], gastroc 4+/5, and extensor hallucis longis [**3-4**].
RLE was iliopsoas [**1-4**], quad [**3-4**], ham [**3-4**], tibialis anterior [**4-3**], gastroc [**4-3**], and extensor hallucis longis [**4-3**].
The sensory line persisted at T2 but there was trace sensation to light touch and position sense in both lower extremities with the left more than the right.
Pathology from a wedge resection at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital was reviewed at the [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] pathology department and was consistent with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
# Abdominal pain: The patient initially presented with a band-like pain, which may have been secondary to the progressive myelitis.
She was started on amlodipine and lisinopril upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], and her blood pressures improved.
Blood counts trended down during the first 10 days of her hospitalization and reached a nadir of Hct 27.0, but then began increasing in over the final days in the hospital.

This lung biopsy showed evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP).
As extensive panel of infectious, autoimmune and viral tests were sent on your spinal fluid and did not provide a definite cause for your symptoms.
There was evidence of inflammation in both your spinal fluid and your blood and your Sjogrens antibodies were positive.
You were treated with steroids and plasmapheresis and your repeat spinal tap and blood markers showed less inflammation.
