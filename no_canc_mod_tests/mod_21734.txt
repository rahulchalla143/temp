CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2130-11-16**] 6:37 PM: FINDINGS: The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
CHEST (PA & LAT) [**2130-11-17**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2130-11-17**] at 11:19:51 AM.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are multiple gas-filled loops of small and large bowel without any air-fluid levels and no free air.
ANKLE XRAY [**2130-11-20**]: There is patchy demineralization about the ankle.
BONE SCAN [**2130-11-21**]: INTERPRETATION: A three phase bone scan was performed, with blood flow and blood pool images performed over the lower extremities.
Blood flow images demonstrate asymmetric increased flow over the left lateral malleolus.
The blood pool phase also demonstrates asymmetric increased uptake over the left lateral malleolus.
This uptake was not present on the prior bone scan from [**2129-7-1**].
Uptake over the left lateral malleolus on all three bone scan phases may be consistent with osteomyelitis, however correlation with a white blood cell scan is recommended for further characterization.
CTA Chest [**2130-10-29**]: 1.
Right lower lobe mass slightly smaller when compared to the CT of [**2128**].
Left pulmonary nodule seen on previous exam is not visualized on the current study and may be related to slice selection and/or motion degradation.
Several hyperenhancing lesions of the liver, incompletely characterized but unchanged compared to the CT of [**2128**].
Tagged WBC Scan [**2130-11-23**]: INTERPRETATION: Following the injection of autologous white blood cells labeled with In-111, images of the whole body with dedicated views of the feet and ankles were obtained at 24 hours.
TTE done with no evidence of vegetation.
As patient with diarrhea, stool studies including C. diff were sent.
These as well as blood and urine cultures are pending to date.
C. diff studies returned positive, and pt was started on Flagyl.
Vanco and Zosyn were stopped after cultures were negative x 72 hours.
As pt later complained of left lateral malleolus, XR was done which was significant only for osteopenia.
Tagged WBC scan to further evaluate was (on prelim read) significant for some abnormal uptake but no definite evidence of osteomyelitis.
If he spikes again, would consider checking MRI of left foot to evaluate for osteomyelitis but no further work-up indicated at this time.
Last colonoscopy 1 year ago with benign polyp per pt.
Rectal exam positive for small amount of bright red blood, likely secondary to inflammatory changes s/p radiation for prostate cancer, stools not grossly blood and Hct stable.
Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
No further work-up pursued as inpatient given stable Hct, but pt should have further work-up by PCP as outpatient.
Pt is to see PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2130-11-28**] for pre-op evaluation and to f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Vascular Surgery on [**2130-12-13**].
As your blood and urine cultures were negative, your IV antibiotics were stopped.
There was a question of possible left ankle osteomyelitis on your bone scan, but Vascular Surgery did not think this was likely on exam, and your tagged white blood scan was not suggestive of this.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**], on Tuesday, [**2130-11-28**] at 2pm for follow-up as well as pre-op clearance for R leg bypass.
