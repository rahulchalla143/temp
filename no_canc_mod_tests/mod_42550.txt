An electrocardiogram upon arrival showed an ST elevations anteriorly.
She was pain free upon arrival and the Coronary Care Unit team was contact[**Name (NI) **] for further management and for cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature 98.8.
Blood pressure 176/80.
Pulse 87.
Respirations 18.
O2 sat 100% on 4 liters oxygen nasal cannula.
Lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 7.4, hematocrit 35.6, platelets 196, sodium 138, K 4.7, chloride 102, bicarb 25, BUN 28, creatinine 1.3, glucose 152, CK 137, CKMB 5, troponin less then .01.
Chest x-ray no acute processes.
Electrocardiogram sinus at 75, ST elevations in V2 through V5 and one in AVL.
She went to the catheterization laboratory, which showed 90% occlusion in her left anterior descending coronary artery in addition to 80% lesions in her right coronary artery.
She also had elevated filling pressures and was sent to the Coronary Care Unit for close monitoring following her catheterization.
Her cardiac enzymes were followed.
She had a peak CK of 1112.
Repeat electrocardiogram showed resolution of her ST elevation.
She had an echocardiogram following her anterior myocardial infarction.
Her echocardiogram showed an EF of 30% with focal akinesis in her distal septum and anterior walls and severe hypokinesis of her apex.
She was monitored on telemetry throughout her hospitalization and had no arrhythmias.
Her blood sugars remained in the low 100s without insulin.
Her electrolytes were followed throughout the hospitalization.
She was scheduled for following of her INR with plans to continue her Lovenox when therapeutic on Coumadin.
She will require follow up in one month for repeat echocardiogram and risk stratification given her low EF.
Cardiac catheterization with two left anterior descending coronary artery cipher stents.
She needs a repeat echocardiogram in one month for risk stratification given her low EF.
