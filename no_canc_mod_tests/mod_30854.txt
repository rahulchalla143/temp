On arrival to ED, BP 140/90, HR 110, spO2 89% on 100% NRB, RR 89.
With finding of pulmonary edema on CXR and positive troponin (1.10), she received Plavix 600 mg PO and was started on integrillin and heparin drips given concern for cardiac ischemia.
She subsequently became transiently bradycardic with HR 40, BP 50/p and a dopamine drip was started.
BP improved to 88/57.
ABG was performed 7.31/42/54, and NIPPV was resumed prior to transfer to CCU.
Physical Exam: VS: T 96, BP 111/82, HR 90, RR 28, O2 94% on NIPPV 8/8/50% Gen: WDWN middle aged female in NAD, in supine position, tolerating NIPPV mask.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated NSR, HR 100.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2146-9-28**] demonstrated: Right-dominant system with no angiographically apparent CAD in LMCA, LAD, LCx, RCA.
LVEF 20% Apical balloning.
HEMODYNAMICS: CO 4.73 CI 2.22 PCWP 38 PA 38 RA 21 RV 59/18 .
CXR (my read): diffuse infiltrates bilaterally, consistent with pulmonary edema  Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, TO BE REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS: Ms. [**Known lastname 26172**] is a 63 yo female with no significant past medical history who presents with pulmonary edema in the setting of new-onset cardiomyopathy .
# Pump:  Patient presents with pulmonary edema, found to have a cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, with no evidence of active ischemia.
- wean dopamine as able, maintaining MAP>65 - initiate AceI and beta-blocker once BP able to tolerate - aggressive diuresis as tolerated by BP and renal function - check lyme serology - check TSH - Social work consult Pt was closely observed during her hospitalization, ambulation was gradually increased, and she was ultimately discharged in stable condition.
# CAD/Ischemia:  Patient with no evidence of CAD on cardiac catheterization.
