Admission Date:  [**2122-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-1-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-4-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Meperidine / Erythromycin Base / Oxycodone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**] Chief Complaint: Fever, [**First Name3 (LF) **]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Central line and Swan Ganz catheter placement Chest tube placement   History of Present Illness: 69 year-old female with CAD s/p RCA stent x 2 (last one [**2121-12-26**] post IMI), CHF with EF 60%, PVD s/p aorto-bifem bypass, and s/p left brachial pseudoaneurysmal repair, transferred from [**Hospital3 3834**] with fever and hypotension, as well as troponin leak.
A cardiac catheterization revealed 95% RCA stenosis (in-stent re-stenosis).
In the ER her vital signs were stable with T 97.0, BP 147/64, RR 18, Sat 98%RA.
JVP was elevated at 6cm, lungs with end expiratory wheezes.
An EKG revealed NSR with RBBB, no acute changes.
Her initial CK was 25, trop 0.04, WBC 4.8, and Cr 0.9.
On the night prior to admission to the [**Hospital1 18**], she became hypotensive with SBP to low 80's, temperature to 104, CK of 300 and CKMB 15.7, trop I 13.5.
Her BP did not improve with fluid resuscitation, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on neosynephrine and heparin IV for possible re-cath.
Cardiac cath in [**2117**] with 80% proximal RCA lesion, 50-60% distal RCA lesion, 50% OM and a 40% distal LM/PLAD lesion.
Cardiac cath [**2118**]: RCA had an ostial 30-40% stenosis and mild 30-40% diffuse in-stent restenosis.
EF of 60%.
Cardiac cath [**2121-12-26**], with 30% instent restenosis in the previously placed RCA stent, and 95% mid vessel stenosis.
Pseudoaneurysm repair '[**17**] 3.
Ex-smoker, stopped smoking 9 years ago (smoked [**12-21**] ppd X 35 yrs).
Family History: N/A  Physical Exam: Physical examination on admission per resident note: VITALS: T 99.9, HR 125, BP 101/42, RR 18, Sat 100% on 4L HEENT: WNL NECK: JVP 6 cm ASA.

[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V3-6, ST depressions in II (old).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Insufficent doppler studies performed of the aortic valve to determine the presence of stenosis or regurgitation.
**************** [**2122-1-19**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2122-1-13**], the findings are similar (Overall LVEF was somewhat overestimated on the prior study).
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year-old female with CAD s/p RCA stent on [**2121-12-27**] for in-stent restenosis, CHF, PVD, who returned to [**Location **] on [**1-8**] with chest pain, initially ruled out, and who then developed fever to 104, hypotension and rise in troponin I, transiently on Neo drip, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
1) CAD: On arrival, an echo revealed an EF of 25%, and resting regional wall motion abnormalities with inferior, inferoseptal, and inferolateral akinesis with relative preservation of the lateral and anterior walls.
CK was 250, Troponin 1.22 (peak), EKG without ST elevations.
A PA line was placed on admission, with initial numbers CVP 11, PA 43/16, SVR 620, CO/CI 7.1/3.76 felt most consistent with sepsis physiology, and MUST protocol was initiated, with fluid resuscitation.
BB therapy was eventually resumed when BP stable.
She will need repeat LFT's as an out-patient given dose titration of Lipitor.
2) CHF: On admission, an echo revealed a depressed EF with inferior, inferoseptal, and inferolateral akinesis.
Subsequent echocardiograms revealed poor EF approximately 20% (overestimated on [**2122-1-13**]) with global LV hypokinesis.
Mycoplasma titers were sent (given her respiratory illness, possible contribution to cardiomyopathy) and still pending at discharge.
Please repeat an out-patient echo in 2 weeks to reassess LVEF.
Her CXR picture slowly improved.
She will need daily weights, with titration of Lasix to 40 mg PO QD if weight increases >3 lbs.
Weight at discharge 68.7 (likely still [**1-22**] kg from goal weight).
Again, please consider a repeat echo in 2 weeks as an out-patient to reassess LVEF.
Serial ABGs and labs revealed a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, with compensatory hyperventilation.
4) ID: As mentionned above, her initial presentation was felt consistent with sepsis, and the MUST protocol was instituted.
The initial CXR revealed atelectasis but no definite consolidation.
All cultures were unremarkable, including sputum, urine and blood cultures.
Serial CXRs failed to reveal a definite consolidation, and it was felt that she may have had a viral pneumonia.
5) Renal failure: Patient with baseline creatinine of 0.5-0.7, up to 1.2 on admission.
Her creatinine rose to a peak of 1.7 in hospital.
Creatinine 1.1 on [**2122-1-22**].
She was also anemic, and was transfused 2 units of PRBCs on [**2122-1-12**] to maintain her hematocrit above 30.
Hematocrit at discharge 33.2.
Discharge Instructions: increases > 3lbs.
