Subsequent TTE and TEE were negative for endocarditis.
- [**12-19**] Spine MR [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) 97910**]/osteomyelitis with an adjasent psoas infection.
L spine films obtained on [**12-21**] were highly suggestive of osteomyelitis/diskitis at L1-2 with accompanying indistinct appearance of the vertebral bodies from L2 to S1.
- Uneventful post op course until [**1-23**] PM when he was found transiently unresponsive, hypotensive and hypoxic - all of which spontaneously resolved within minutes.

Fracture involving the first proximal phalanx extending to the IP joint,  ECHO Conclusions: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No echo evidence of endocarditis.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] IMPRESSION: Abnormal signal at the L1-L2 level and within the L1 vertebral body with abnormal enhancement in the adjacent psoas muscles, consistent with a [**Name13 (STitle) 97910**]/osteomyelitis with adjacent psoas infection.
Limited evaluation of the spinal canal suggests epidural infection at L1-2.
If there is a decline in neurologic function, a repeat study is recommended.
CT LE IMPRESSION: 1) Status post debridement in the medial malleolar region, with a VAC dressing in place, contacting the distal tibia.
[**1-23**] CT LE IMPRESSION: 1) Erosive and destructive changes involving the ankle, which may be consistent with the stated history of osteomyelitis.
When the sensitivities grew out MSSA, antibiotics were changed to oxacillin.
Orthopaedic service consulted and proceeded with a left ankle I&D with removal of hardware on [**12-4**]; wound cultures grew out MSSA.
Ortho spine and neurosurgery followed the patient while admitted.
Additionally, a urine culture was sent on [**1-24**] and grew gram negative rods (U/A negative).
A urine culture will be repeated [**Hospital **] rehab once the cipro is completed.
After his third surgery, his HCT fell to 26 and remained stable between 26-28.
Bactroban cream started [**Hospital1 **] with clean dressings.
Enoxaparin Sodium 30 mg/0.3 mL Syringe Sig: One (1) Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours).
