On discharge: ****   Pertinent Results: CT Head [**2147-12-13**]: Stable size and appearance of intraparenchymal and interventricular hemorrhage, pneumocephalus, post-surgical changes and frontal hematoma.
Midline shift measures 12 mm today vs 10 mm today likely due to inter-scan variability given stable size of intracranial hemorrhage and edema.
CT Head [**2147-12-11**]: 1.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**2147-12-9**]: 1.
MRA of Brain [**2147-12-9**]: There is no evidence of significant flow stenotic lesions, mild deviation of the vessels on the right, likely consistent with mass effect from the previously drained parenchymal hematoma.
MRA of Neck [**2147-12-9**]: Patency of the carotid arteries and vertebral arteries with mild  decreased signal at the origin of the left common carotid artery, possibly artifactual in nature.
CT Head [**2147-12-9**]: 1.
CT Head [**2147-12-8**]: 5 cm right intraparenchymal hemorrhage in right temporal and parietal lobe with extension into right lateral ventricle.
CT C-spine [**2147-12-8**]: Linear lucency through the right C4 transverse foramen.
A CTA is recommended for assessment of [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] injury.
CTA Head and Neck [**2147-12-8**]: 1.
Similar size and appearance of large parenchymal hematoma and  intraventricular hemorrhage as estimated on the contrast-enhanced study, and similar degree of mass effect, midline shift and central herniation.
On [**2147-12-9**], she had a NCHCT which showed expected post-operative changes, with persistent 10mm of midline shift.
With this event, she underwent a Head CT which showed Slight interval enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles but was otherwise unchanged from previous studies.
On [**2147-12-12**] her exam improved with her eyes opening to voice, following commands in the Right Upper and Right Lower extremities as well as the Left Upper extremity.
On [**2147-12-13**] her mannitol dosing was decreased from 50mg q4hours to 50mg q6hours, and her exam remained stable, however she appeared to be more interactive.
Her neuro exam remained stable despite this.
A STAT Head CT was obtained which was stable when compared to the prior study done on [**2147-12-13**].
Her mannitol was then decreased to 25g q6 hours with the intent to wean.
Her exam was improved and she was following commands with the right side.
Her mannitol was decreased to 12.5 Q6 hours.
On [**2147-12-16**] her sputum culture grew coag + staph aureus so she was changed to Cipro.
The patient's mannitol was decreased again and her exam remained stable.
Eventual cultures were negative for HSV but positive serum HSV for which she was treated for 7 days with Acyclovir.
Her hematocrit was trended during her hospital course.
On discharge her hct was 24.8.
Follow up CXR showed on [**12-25**] showed much improved pneumonia.
All blood have been negative to date.
HSV culture was finalized on [**2147-12-20**] which was positive for HSV, negative shingles; Acyclovir for 7 days for treatment.
On [**12-25**] she had a transient increase in LFTs for which her Naficllin was changed to Vancomycin and a ultrasound of her liver showed a grossly normal son[**Name (NI) 493**] assessment of the abdomen with incidental note of hepatic cyst.
Her hepatitis panel was negative.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
