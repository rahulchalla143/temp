She was emergently intubated and transported to the Intensive Care Unit where she underwent a flexible bronchoscopy and clearing of the airways by the Intensive Care Service.
Additionally, flexible bronchoscopy demonstrated a pulsatile mass in the right middle lobe which upon evaluation opened up and began bleeding massive amounts of blood.
The following day she went to the invasive radiology angio suite and had a aortogram which demonstrated a right middle lobe bronchial artery aneurysm.
After several days of intubation in the Intensive Care Unit she was finally extubated when her sepsis cleared and was eventually discharged in good condition on [**2146-6-7**].
PLAN: The plan was to have her come back in one month's time to undergo a flexible bronchoscopy and evaluation of the airway to assess the right middle lobe bronchus in the area where the aneurysm had been.
Additionally we will obtain a CT scan to rule out a parenchymal mass.
We have subsequently performed a three month bronchoscopy and CT scan of the chest.
There is no evidence on bronchoscopy or CT scan of any residual mass or aneurysm within the right frontal lobe.
Thus we will perform one more CT scan and bronchoscopy at the six month interval to confirm the absence of any new masses.
