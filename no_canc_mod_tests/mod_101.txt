IMAGING: CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**6-15**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
A proximal obstruction cannot be excluded as contrast was administered through the jejunostomy tube.
Abdominal XRay ([**6-22**]): IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
CXR ([**6-23**]): FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the previous study from [**2164-6-22**].
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**6-25**]): CONCLUSION: 1.
Abdominal Pathology ([**6-27**]): Ileum, segmental resection: 1.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**7-10**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Short term follow-up pelvic CT with oral contrast to evaluate for change or filling is suggested to aid differentiaion.
CT Pelvis ([**7-11**]): IMPRESSION: The previously described possible fluid collection on today's study appears to be a loculated pocket of ascites or intrapelvic abscess measuring 2.7 x 4.8 x 2.2 cm (AP, transverse, craniocaudal).
At the time, Pt's lab values during the initial period, including CBC and electrolytes were all normal throughout the hosptial course.
However, over the next few days, he continued to have trouble with SBO, and a significant high-grade bowel obstruction distal from the J-tube site was found on Abd CT on [**6-25**].
By [**7-2**], he was passing stools, and his NGT output was decreased until it came out and it was not replaced.
He did fail a swallow study on [**7-4**], and he has remained NPO.
The patient seemed to be more somnolent and less responsive on [**7-10**], and he had a repeat CT abdomen/pelvis which showed interval improvement in his SBO, but also a 2.1 X 4.4 cm loculated fluid collection as described above could represent a fluid filled pelvic ileal loop.
A subsequent Pelvic CT with PO contrast showed a loculated pocket of ascites or intrapelvic abscess measuring 2.7 x 4.8 x 2.2 cm.
The surgeons (including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] reviewed the films and determined that this was unlikely to be an abscess, and there was no need to take him for CT guided drainage or back to the OR.
C. Difficle Colitis: On HD 2 the patient was found to have stool positive for C.Diff.
Repeat C. diff stool cultures on [**8-17**], [**7-5**], and [**7-11**] were negative.
Dilantin levels were checked daily and often found to be subtherapeutic.
Post-operatively, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was maintained on IV Dilantin and Lorazepam, and his dilantin levels were followed.
His Trileptal was kept at 300-600-300, and his Felbatol was kept at 1400 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Upper GI Bleed: On [**6-22**], pt had black vomitus which was guaiac positive hence NGT was placed and pt had copious black fluid output which was once again guaiac positive.
Pt had stat CBC, type and screen and IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] was started and GI was consulted who recommended CT scan to rule out obstruction.
CXR [**6-25**] showed increased prominence of the airspace consolidations at both bases, consistent with pneumonia.
Repeat CXR on [**7-10**] showed marked improvement compared to 10 days prior with small residual right lower lobe consolidation  6.
Hyponatremia: Sodium nadired at 128, but was 130 at the time of discharge.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: C. difficile colitis SBO from adhesions Ischemic bowel GI bleed Hyponatremia likely secondary to Trileptal Reactive Thrombocytosis  SECONDARY: [**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut syndrome Mental retardation s/p recent J-tube placement   Discharge Condition: Stable, nonverbal, moving all extremities against gravity, tracks eyes past midline, no obvious abdominal pain   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital with C. difficile colitis, and this treated with antibiotics.
You then had hematemesis and your blood pressure became low, consistent with an upper GI bleed.
You had an exploratory laparotomy, and were found to have an SBO secondary to adhesions and ischemic bowels s/p resection and primary anastamosis.
Your sodium remained low (130 at the time of discharge) during this hospitalization which is likely secondary to Trileptal use.
Your platelet count was elevated to the 1000s, which is likely a reactive thrombocytosis.
If you develop increased frequency of seizures, decreased responsiveness, abdominal pain, increased frequency of diarrhea, fevers/chills, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 850**], or return to the ED.
