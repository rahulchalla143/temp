In the ED, initial vitals were: T 98.5, HR 92, BP 153/81, RR 16, 94% on room air.
Later in ED stay, however, he was febrile (Tmax 101.4), tachycardic (HR 110-140), hypertensive (SBP 165-200), and tachypneic (RR 22-36), with O2sats 94% on 4L nc.
He was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring given his labored breathing and abnormal vital signs.

Recommend multiphase liver MRI for further evaluation.
CXR [**2185-3-29**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute pneumonia.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia@120BPM,L atrial abnormality, RBBB (new relative to EKG [**2184-6-15**]) 1mm ST depressions V2-V3, frequent PVC's.
He has been afebrile since transfer from to the floor but his WBC was still elevated until [**3-30**] when it was normal.
Opacity on chest CT c/w atypical pna.
Sputum gram stain polymicrobial (2+GNR, 1+GPC, 1+GPR).
CTA negative for PE.
Treated CAP with Azithromycin x 2 day course (d1 [**3-29**]); CTX x 2d (d1 [**3-29**]).
Blood cultures, urinary legionella antigen are pending.
CXR [**3-31**] showed atelectasis.
# Hypertension: pt w/ h/o HTN on amlodipine, lopressor, and lisinopril, furosamide at home, hypertensive in ED to SBP 200.
Stable on floor w/ home regimen meds, lisinopril was increased from 20mg to 40mg QD on [**3-30**] due to systolic pressures >135 on [**3-30**].
Additional episode of tachy on night of [**3-31**] prompted increase of lopressor from 100mg to 150mg [**Hospital1 **] as above.
However, new RBBB on EKG concerning: ddx rate-related conduction delay vs. PE/R-heart strain (unlikely given neg CT) vs. ischemia.
CK elevated (274, 397), but MB fraction <2.5% and minimally elevated Tn (0.02) make ACS unlikely.
[**Month (only) 116**] be small enzyme leak related to tachycardia (demand ischemia.
Negative cardiac enzymes x3.
A repeat EKG ([**3-30**]) showed persistence of RBBB, but with negative enzymes, did not mandate further work-up.
Pt was monitored on tele and received home dose of lopressor 100bid (increased from 100mg [**Hospital1 **] to 150mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**4-1**]) .
You had an episode of respiratory distress, fever and high blood pressure and were stabilized in the intensive care unit.
