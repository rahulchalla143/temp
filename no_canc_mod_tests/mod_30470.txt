Upon arrival, her BP was initially 136/88 but increased to 205/83 by 14:55.
She was started on a nicardipine drip for blood pressure control.
Head CT was done which showed right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular extension.
Past Medical History: -vascular dementia-Diagnosed in [**2137-12-18**] at [**Last Name (un) 11786**] -HTN -mild CAD -possible TIA in [**2135**]; Per note in chart, work-up included an echo which showed PFO with atrial septal aneurysm.
Apparently, no further work-up for this was done.
-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in [**2134**] after a fall -gerd -hypothyroidism  -chronic back pain, -hyperlipidemia -bilateral cataract excisions complicated by retinal injury   Social History: No children, 2 sisters who are involved in her care.

Pertinent Results: [**2138-2-5**] 02:20AM BLOOD WBC-7.6 RBC-4.10* Hgb-11.5* Hct-35.6* MCV-87 MCH-28.0 MCHC-32.2 RDW-14.6 Plt Ct-268 [**2138-2-4**] 12:30PM BLOOD PT-12.2 PTT-25.3 INR(PT)-1.0 [**2138-2-4**] 12:30PM BLOOD Glucose-101* UreaN-19 Creat-0.8 Na-139 K-3.4 Cl-98 HCO3-27 AnGap-17  CEs neg x 3  Urine and blood cx negative  IMAGING: CXR:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
HEAD CT [**2-4**]: There is extensive multicompartmental intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no acute fracture  CT C-SPINE 1.
Additionally, slight suboptimal evaluation of the upper thoracic vertebral bodies on the lateral view of the thoracic spine, although T1 through T3 are included on the C-spine CT.
CTA HEAD AND NECK 1.
EEG [**2-6**] This EEG is markedly abnormal and gives evidence for a moderate diffuse encephalopathy along with right hemisphere periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges and occasional bilateral synchronous epileptiform discharges.
EEG [**2-14**] This is an abnormal routine EEG due to focal slowing in the right frontal region suggestive of subcortical dysfunction in this region and consistent with patient's history of intraparenchymal  hemorrhage.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances and infections are common causes.
CXR [**2-14**] New small left-sided pleural effusion.
Her exam was notable for agitation, essentially no speech, only following one command, and not answering questions.
Imaging showed a multicompartmental intracranial hemorrhage, involving RIGHT frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Blood pressures were controlled on IV and then PO medications, and she was transferred when stable to the neurology floor.
Calorie count was performed and she steadily took in at least 1000 calories per day.
Your blood pressure was controlled with new medications.
