While admitted, he underwent a stress test that revealed signs of lateral wall ischemia.
Upon arrival to the floor, and after fluid resusciation he was not noted to be orthostatic.
He had a cardiac catheterization whcih revealed coronary artery disease and was referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization evaluation.

Selective renal angiography revealed 80% left and 70% right renal artery stenosis.
Limited resting hemodynamic revealed severe systemic arterial  hypertension of 214/84mmHg.
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE Study Date of [**2111-4-1**] 12:43 PM TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Extracranial evaluation of bilateral carotids was performed with B mode, color and spectral Doppler ultrasound.
On the right side, peak systolic velocities are 223 cm/sec, 103 cm/sec and 120 cm/sec in the internal, common, and external carotid arteries respectively.
The right ICA to CCA ratio is 2.4.
On the left side, peak systolic velocities are 572 cm/sec, 52 cm/sec, and 261 cm/sec in the internal, common and external carotid arteries respectively.
Renal U/S [**2111-4-1**]: RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2111-4-1**] 1:44 PM The right kidney measures 10 cm in length and the left kidney 10.7 cm.
Color flow and pulse Doppler assessment was performed showing relatively normal and symmetrical upstroke of the main renal arteries on the left and right side at the level of the renal hilum with perhaps a slight delay of time to peak on the left side compared to the right.
CT or MRI would be preferable and non-contrast studies could be adequate for this purpose.
CXR [**2111-4-1**]: FINDINGS: No previous images.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2111-4-1**] at 11:15:50 AM      FINAL  Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS Study Date of [**2111-4-2**] 5:34 PM FINDINGS: CT HEAD: The parenchymal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is maintained.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells where included on the exam are clear.
No evidence of infarction, hemorrhage or mass is identified on the non-contrast CT portion of the exam.
There are scattered foci of white matter hypodensity which may represent chronic small vessel ischemic disease, if there is sufficient clinical concern for infarction, MRI is more sensitive in a patient with no contraindications to MRI.
CTA of the head demonstrates scattered calcified atheromatous plaque without flow-limiting stenosis.
CTA of the neck demonstrates severe (string sign) stenoses of the proximal bilateral internal carotid arteries, left more severe than right, described above with a string of contrast passing beyond calcified atheromatous plaque.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2111-4-4**] 9:11 PM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.
No CT evidence of an acute major vascular territorial infarction.
MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction, if clinically indicated.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
His pre-op work-up carotid ultrasound showed 70% stenosis on the L and 80-90% stenosis on the R. A left carotid stent was placed on [**4-3**].
A CT of his head was negative for an acute process.He was also found to have possible suprarenal mass when renal vessels selectively engaged on cath.
However, a renal ultrasound was repeated and did not show a mass, although CT and MRI were recommended as better studies.
Edema 1+    Discharge Instructions: Please shower daily including washing incisions gently with mild soap, no baths or swimming until cleared by surgeon.
