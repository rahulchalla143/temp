In the Emergency Department the patient was found to have a blood sugar of 570, was found to be tachycardic, afebrile, with an anion gap of 40, small ketones in her urine and total c02 of 7.
A chest x-ray was obtained which was clear without evidence of infiltrate but a dedimer returned with greater than 1,900 and an emergent CTA was done showing a filling defect in the right posterior apical segmental branch with multiple areas of air space opacities within the left upper and left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.

Electrocardiogram - sinus tachycardia at 114, right atrial enlargement, no ST or T-wave changes.
Chest x-ray - lungs are clear, no congestive heart failure, mild pectus.
CT angiogram of the chest - positive pulmonary edema in the right posterior apical segmental branch and peripheral pulmonary opacities in the left upper and lower lobes concerning for pneumonia.
However, the patient was initially started on weight-based heparin with a goal PTT of 60-80 and was subsequently transitioned on the day prior to discharge on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous twice a day as well as Coumadin loaded while she was in house.
The patient had a discharge INR of 1.4 based on two loads of 5 mg and a 7.5 mg load.
The patient will be discharged with 5 mg of Coumadin to have her INR followed up with her primary care physician on [**2105-11-23**].
Until her INR is greater than 2.0 the patient will likely need to have Lovenox shots.
Monitor her 02 sats which were greater than 92% on room air.
The patient remained afebrile with a white blood cell count that was stable and within normal limits, although there was a question of pneumonia on the chest x-ray.
Weight loss/fatigue.
Albumin was obtained which was low and we had a nutrition consult in house which established patient to have supplements in her nutrition status.
The patient had a stable platelet count was in house with no acute evidence of infection.
Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturations on room air, afebrile, stable fingerstick blood sugar controlled, no cough or wheezing.
