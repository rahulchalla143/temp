A head ct was done and revealed blood in the ventricular system with an entraped left lateral ventricle and subsequent hydrocephalus.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-5-3**] 9:46 PM IMPRESSION: Acute hydrocephalus with multiple foci of blood within the bilateral lateral ventricles, cerebral aqueduct, and fourth ventricle with ventricular catheter placed within the left lateral ventricle.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-5-4**] 7:54 AM IMPRESSION:  Minimal if any decrease in ventricular size.
The pt's neurologic exam never improved from her initial presentation despite shunt placement, and a cerebral angiogram revealed a minimum of 7 more aneuyrsms, at least one of which (ACOMM) was not amenable to coiling or clipping.
All life-supporting measures were withdrawn, and she was treated with a morphine drip and ativan for her pain/anxiety.
