Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
CXR [**2175-1-11**] (PORTABLE): In comparison with the study of [**2173-10-8**], there has been substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
It is difficult to determine whether this represents a manifestation of vascular congestion or merely a reflection of the size of the patient and the AP portable technique.
CXR [**2175-1-12**] (PA/LAT): Pacemaker leads are in standard position with tips in the right atrium and right ventricle.
ECHO [**2175-1-17**]: There is left ventricular hypertrophy with prominent interventricular septum (at least 30 mm thick at its base).
On baseline imaging, a resting left ventricular outflow gradient of at least 26 mmHg was recorded.
Cardiac Cath [**2175-1-17**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Worsening symptoms recently with weight gain of 15.6 lbs in 3 wks over the holidays.
TTE was done to evaluate for interval change in her cardiac function, which showed improved LVOT (which likely points to volume overload and increased preload).
Echo was done after the alcohol septal ablation and noted no significant residual left ventricular outflow gradient with peak left ventricular outflow velocity of 1 m/s.
Continued on home verapamil, olmesartan, atenolol changed to carvedilol with improvement in blood pressure.
Her blood pressure was more elevated after her alcohol septal ablation, likely from the resolution of LVOT gradient, and will need follow up as an outpatient for further uptitration of her anti-hypertensives.
# HL: continued on home pravastatin  # Anemia: new anemia, baseline high 30 to 40, Patient's CBC was trended and it remained stably around mid 30s.
Iron studies were added and did not suggest iron deficiency anemia.
Disp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0* 12. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
These CHANGES were made to your medications: - Your atenolol was STOPPED - You were STARTED on carvedilol (Coreg) for your heart rate and blood pressure.
