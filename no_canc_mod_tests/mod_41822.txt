Holter monitor in [**Month (only) 116**] revealed sustained atrial fibrillation with HR up to 165 with pauses up to 3.2 seconds; Lifewatch monitor in [**Month (only) **] revealed pauses up to 4 seconds (per notes).
On review of systems, she endorses prior history of stroke/TIA (2-minute duration of left arm numbness and aphasia in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2177**]; left parietal infarct noted on imaging) and deep venous thrombosis in [**2175**] (left leg).
She has had recent FUO, but no fever since her last admission and no chills or rigors or nightsweats.

- ECHO (TEE) [**2177-6-23**]: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
She also had episodes of AF with RVR in the 150's.
Pneumothorax was confirmed on chest xray and though ptient remained asymptomatic, serial xrays revealed that left pneumothorax has increased in volume with substantial atelectasis at the base of the lung as well as a small and increasing left pleural effusion.
Pacer interogration revealed that it was functioning properly, however pt often had episodes of being paced at max rate in response to sensed atrial fibrillation beats.
# FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN: Patient has had recurrent fevers for several months, though work-up to date has been unrevealing (negative CT torso, negative TEE, cultures negative, s/p empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics).
