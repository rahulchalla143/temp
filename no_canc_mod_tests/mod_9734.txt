An arterial blood gas showed 7.49/35/67 while he was saturating at 92% on room air.
A right lower extremity ultrasound revealed an extensive DVT from the popliteal vein cephalad to include the common femoral vein.
A stat chest CT showed a massive pulmonary embolism with a saddle embolus extending across the bifurcation of both the right and left pulmonary artery with extensive emboli throughout both lower lobes.
The was started on a heparin drip and emergently transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure was 117/72, pulse 98, respiratory rate 28, temperature 99.2, oxygen saturation 99% on three liters.
There was no cyanosis or clubbing and he had +2 dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 102, bicarbonate 25, BUN 20, creatinine 1.4, glucose 113.
His white blood cell count was 8.9.
His hematocrit was 37.9, platelet count 244, PT 13.1, PTT 22.3 and an INR was 1.2.
His initial cardiac enzymes showed a CK of 256, a CK MB of 4.4, a troponin of 2.9.
EKG on presentation showed sinus tachycardia with a slight PR prolongation.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was unable to be assessed.
The right ventricular cavity was moderately dilated and the right ventricular systolic function appeared to be depressed.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed which showed that the left atrium was mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal with an ejection fraction of approximately 70%.
Multiple laboratory studies were drawn to determine the patient's coagulation status.
Protein C was slightly elevated with a value of 132.
Protein S was normal with a value of 91.
Anticardiolipin antibody studies were normal.
The prothrombin mutation analysis showed no mutations and the factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**] analysis showed no genetic mutations also.
The patient remained on a heparin drip and he was seen by the pulmonary team for evaluation of whether thrombolysis therapy should be initiated.
His O2 saturations remained above 92% on two liters.
The patient was then set up with the outpatient [**Hospital 197**] clinic at the VA who will manage his Coumadin and INR with a goal INR between 2 and 3.
Follow up at the [**Hospital **] clinic in two [**Known lastname **] for an INR check and for further management of his Coumadin.
The patient know to return to the emergency room if he develops any shortness of breath, chest pain, chest tightness, dyspnea on exertion or lower extremity pain.
