He called Emergency Medical Service who found the patient to be dyspneic and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 70% on room air.
His dysphagia was for solid foods, and the patient described it as if "something was caught in my throat."
The patient was referred for Ear/Nose/Throat and had a swallowing study done on [**3-25**] (one day prior to admission) with a barium esophagogram showing a nonspecific motor disorder of the esophagus with one episode of aspiration.
In the Emergency Department, the patient's oxygen saturation was 70% on room air and improved to 90% to 95% on a nonrebreather.
His blood pressure was 96/50.
An arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.41, a PCO2 of 46, and a PO2 of 98.
He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and catheterization showed clean coronary arteries.
In the Catheterization Laboratory, the patient developed further deterioration of his mental status as well as hypoxemia and respectively acidosis with an arterial blood gas of 7.25/61/67.
He was placed on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
As of [**3-27**], the patient was off of [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure since 4 a.m. and stable with an arterial blood gas of 7.38/46/82.
Chronic renal failure (with a baseline creatinine of 1.2 to 1.5).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination at the time of transfer revealed temperature was 96.1, blood pressure was 114/49, heart rate was 60, respiratory rate was 25, and oxygen saturation was 95% on 5 liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed surgical pupils, 2 mm bilaterally.
Heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed 1+ pitting lower extremity edema to the knees bilaterally with venous stasis skin changes.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times three.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on transfer revealed white blood cell count was 13.9, hematocrit was 36.7, and platelet count was 204.
Sodium was 145, potassium was 3.4, chloride was 107, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 17, creatinine was 2.1, and blood glucose was 170.
Calcium was 8.1, magnesium was 2, and phosphate was 3.7.
Total bilirubin was 1.4 and direct bilirubin was 0.4.
Creatine kinase was 104.
INR was 1.1 and partial thromboplastin time was 26.
Urinalysis revealed yellow/clear and small blood.
Negative nitrites, ketones, bilirubin, leukocyte esterase, 30 mg/dL of protein, 3 to 5 red blood cells, 0 to 2 white blood cells, and a few bacteria.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest radiograph on [**3-26**] revealed an increased density at the left base, right hemidiaphragm less distinct, perihilar edema consistent with heart failure.
A chest radiograph on [**3-27**] showed decreased heart failure, no infiltrates, and decreased bibasilar atelectasis.
An echocardiogram on [**3-26**] was a suboptimal study with normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size.
Catheterization on [**3-26**] revealed no significant obstructive disease.
Ejection fraction was 60%.
Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure at 17 mmHg.
With further diuresis, the patient's oxygen saturations were improved and by [**4-1**] he was saturating greater than 92% on room air.
His furosemide was held starting on the evening of [**3-29**] because he started to appear hypovolemic on examination with dry mucous membranes and poor skin turgor.
He received a video oropharyngeal swallowing study which demonstrated an intact swallowing mechanism with no evidence of aspiration.
To rule out further heart failure, a chest radiograph was obtained on [**3-31**] which demonstrated some bibasilar atelectasis, but no evidence of heart failure.
Lower extremity venous ultrasounds with Doppler studies were obtained and revealed no deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
Given the patient's recent history of twisting his left ankle, a plain film was obtained which revealed no evidence of fracture or dislocation.
RENAL ISSUES:  As aforementioned, at the time of transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a creatinine of 2.1.
His fractional excretion of sodium was 0.19%.
The patient maintained good urine output throughout his time on the floor, and his creatinine improved to a level of 1.4 at the time of discharge.
He had persistent mild elevations in his fasting blood sugars which ranged between 150 and 200.
