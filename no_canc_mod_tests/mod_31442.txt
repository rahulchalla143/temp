HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 76-year-old female with a history of aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement, on chronic Coumadin therapy, who presented to [**Hospital1 69**] after a fall which led to a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe and small subdural hematoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Her physical examination upon transfer to the Medicine Service showed vital signs which revealed she was afebrile, pulse was 93, blood pressure was 167/65.
Her general appearance revealed she was a confused-appearing and well-nourished female in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination showed pupils were equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Her neck examination showed no masses, no jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular examination was irregularly irregular with a prominent first heart sound and second heart sound secondary to her valve replacements.
Her extremities showed no edema, clubbing or cyanosis, and there was a splint on her left thumb.
Her neurologic examination showed cranial nerves II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, [**Doctor First Name 81**], and XII were intact.
Her reflexes revealed she was hyporeflexic in the lower extremities and hyperreflexic in the upper extremities.
She had a positive suck reflex, a negative snout reflex, positive grasp reflex, and positive perseveration.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's laboratories on admission showed a white blood cell count of 12.2, hemoglobin was 14.8, hematocrit was 41, and a platelet count of 218.
She had a PT of 25, PTT was 38.3, and an INR of 4.3.
Her Chemistry-7 showed sodium was 139, potassium was 5, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 18, creatinine was 1.3, blood glucose was 249.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Otherwise, a CT of the head showed a question of a subdural hematoma at the right sylvian fissure versus a brain contusion.
A CT of the cervical spine showed no fractures.
An x-ray of the lumbar spine showed no fractures.
An x-ray of the thoracic spine showed no fractures.
An x-ray of the hand showed a transverse fracture of the left distal first phalanx.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was significant for an admission to Neurosurgery where she remained for one day and had her anticoagulation reversed with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.  She was subsequently transferred to the Medicine Service after serial CT examinations of the head which were negative for an increase in the size of the bleed.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended that the patient's PTT be maintained around 40 to 60.
The Neurology Stroke Service agreed with this assessment and decided the patient should be anticoagulated for at one week with serial CT examinations to look for increasing size of the subarachnoid hemorrhage with a central hematoma and could subsequently be switched to Coumadin after one week with a stable CT scan of the head.
