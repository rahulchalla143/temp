Currently the patient has had a repeat CT scan which demonstrated FDG avidity in the region of the lung nodule and some uptake in T11.
He does come today with an X-ray report of the thoracic and lumbar spine which demonstrated no abnormality in that region.

He was followed with surveillance CT scans as he desired conservative management as opposed to VATS biopsy.
The nodule continued to grow on f/u CT scan [**1-/2103**] and recommendation was made for resection.
On POD2, his chest xray demonstrated progressive collapse as well as a sizeable pneumothorax.
On [**3-25**], his CXR demonstrated continued atalectasis and he returned to the OR for a repeat therapeutic bronchoscopy.
A CT chest was obtained [**3-29**] and demonstrated an apical pleural effusion which was drained with a pigtail by Interventional pulmonology.
His last bronchoscopy was [**3-30**] with IP and resulted in significant improvement in his CXR with greater aeration.
He continued to work with physical therapy and his ambulatory saturations improved.
His pigtail drainage decreased significantly and was insignificant on [**2103-4-3**] at which time it was removed.
On [**4-3**], his pain was well controlled, he was tolerating a regular diet and his CXR following pigtail removal was stable.
