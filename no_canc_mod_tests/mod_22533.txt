Initial ECG at the outside hospital demonstrated ST segment elevations of 1 0.5 to 1 mm in 3 and aVF as well as Q-waves in 2, 3, and aVF.
The first set of cardiac enzymes are negative.
However, the patient's second set of enzymes revealed a CK of 522, an MB of 61.7, and a troponin-I of 3.11.
The patient was transferred to the CCU and then subsequently to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, blood pressure was 104/64, heart rate was 64 and regular, respiratory rate is 18.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
No calf tenderness and has 2 plus DP and PT pulses bilaterally.
EKG demonstrates sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with normal axis and intervals.
Q-waves in 2, 3, and aVF as well as 0.5 mm ST segment elevations in 2, 3, and aVF.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, sodium 142, potassium 3.6, chloride 104, bicarbonate 24, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, and glucose 139.
White count of 12.9 with hematocrit of 40.7, and platelets of 263.
His lipid panel revealed a total cholesterol of 162 with an HDL of 48 and an LDL of 96.
The patient was maintained on a nitroglycerin drip intermittently and serial EKGs were followed.
The patient was taken for cardiac catheterization on [**2164-7-9**].
Catheterization revealed 1-vessel coronary artery disease including a mid LAD total occlusion with faint TIMI 1 distal flow in the left-to-left collaterals.
Final angiography demonstrated no dissection and TIMI 3 flow.
Echocardiogram also on the [**2164-7-9**] demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50 to 55 percent with an apical left ventricular aneurysm as well as anterior apical akinesis, septal apex akinesis, inferior apex akinesis and apical akinesis.
