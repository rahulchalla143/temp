GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Interpretation assigned to [**Name6 (MD) 15425**] [**Name8 (MD) 15426**], MD, Interpreting physician    Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 71 year old male with a history of multiple revisions of pace-maker, coronary artery disease, chronic systolic congestive heart failure-?acute on chronic systolic CHF, and bipolar disorder who presents from [**State **] for evaluation of non-healing wound and likely pacemaker revision.
He reports that he has had continued drainage and bleeding from his chest wall abnormality that is concerning for persistent infection (either abscess, infected new or old wires that are in place) in setting of sinus tract.
His wound culture subsequently grew MRSA.
An ECHO was obtained which showed no vegetation.
INR goal 2.0.
