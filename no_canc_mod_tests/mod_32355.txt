[**6-20**] CT C spine: IMPRESSION: Comminuted fractures of C5 and C6 in a flexion teardrop configuration, extending into the middle column.
If focal neural deficits localize to the cervical spine, MRI may be useful to exclude cord contusion.
[**6-20**] CT torso: 1.
Otherwise, right knee x- ray examination is within normal limits on these views.
[**6-22**] XR pelvis: Thirteen fluoroscopic images from the operating room of the right hemipelvis show interval placement of a fracture plate across the iliac bone extending into the iliopectineal line and pubic symphysis on the right side.
[**6-23**] MRI C spine: 1.
Vertebral body fractures at C5 and C6, better depicted on the CT dated [**2195-6-20**].
CT head and CXR neg, C5-6 teardrop fx on CT neck, L1 fx and mult pelvic fx on CT torso.
The patient was admitted to the TSICu under Attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], for serial HCT due to retroperitoneal hematoma.
Neurosurgery was consulted for the spinal fx and recommended C-collar to be worn at all times, MRI of C-spine, logroll precautions and TLSO.
HOD2: Pt remained stable, although her HCT trended down from 29.1 to 24.6.
HOD3: Two units PRBCs transfused with a repeat HCT of 28.9.
An [**Hospital 79399**] rehabilitation facility was identified and she was discharged to their care for further intensive physical and occupational therapy.
