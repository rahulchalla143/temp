He denies  In the emergency room the patient was found to be tachycardic to 140, hypotension to 90/palp, acidotic with ABG of 7.18, 16, 134.
Coagulopathic with INR of 65.6 and in acute renal failure with BUN of 100 and creatinine of 8.
Acid Base - The patient anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to diarrhea and acute renal failure.
Anion gap closed after fluid.
Renal - Acute renal failure with creatinine of 8 up from baseline of 1.7.
Renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction.
Electrolytes - The patient's potassium and magnesium were aggressively repleted in setting of ongoing diarrhea.
EGD and colonoscopy were deferred.
Hematocrit remained stable after transfusion.
Stool studies were sent.
On admission elevated INR was thought to be secondary to inadvertent Coumadin overdosing.
His INR was reversed with 6 units of fresh frozen plasma and 10 milligrams of subcutaneous vitamin K.  The patient was also transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 35 down from baseline of 42.
TTP was ruled out by normal sphere.
CT scan of the head was negative for hemorrhage.
Viral load greater than 100,000.

Stool studies are pending.
Coagulopathy - The patient's INR was corrected with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K as per HPI.
Creatinine returned to baseline after fluid resuscitation.
Gastrointestinal - Diarrhea became non-bloody once INR was corrected.
Abdominal CT scan was obtained which was negative for bowel wall thickening.
Infectious Disease - Stool studies were sent which were positive for microsporidia times two as well as 4+ PMNs.
