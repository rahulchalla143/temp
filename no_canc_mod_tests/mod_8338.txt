Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35% and global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Epo 5,000 units 2x/week.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature is 97.1, heart rate 88, blood pressure 155/70, respiratory rate 20, and O2 saturation is 99% on room air.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His abdominal examination revealed normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, he had guaiac negative stool on rectal examination.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
Examination of his skin revealed no rashes.
LABORATORIES ON EXAMINATION:  Sodium was 121, potassium 6.7, chloride 84, bicarb 8, BUN and creatinine of 111 and 8.1 respectively.
Blood glucose initially on admission was 1,111.
His anion gap was 29.
Complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 10.8, hematocrit of 29.9, platelets of 427.
LFTs revealed an ALT of 62, AST of 56, alkaline phosphatase of 301, amylase of 63, total bilirubin of 0.4.
Initial arterial blood gas was 7.20/23/89.
Electrocardiogram was sinus rhythm at 95 beats per minute with a normal axis.
Chest x-ray revealed small bilateral effusions.
Initially because of poor po intake, he was only given 10 units of Lantus insulin and his blood sugars were persistently between 200-300.
Pulmonary:  Because of his anemia, which is likely secondary to his renal disease, he was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells on the 15th.
Following this blood transfusion and in addition to the aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation he received, the patient developed pulmonary edema, and was restarted on his outpatient dose of Lasix 80 mg po bid.
With the pleural effusions at the lung bases were obscured, to better evaluate lung parenchyma, a CT scan of the chest was done which revealed a right lower lobe parenchymal air space consolidation with again no evidence of bilateral pleural effusions associated with compressive atelectasis.
Sputum culture was obtained which revealed fewer than 10 polys, and culture grew moderate oropharyngeal flora.
Culture of this fluid yielded no growth.
Gram stain revealed no organisms or leukocytes.
Chemistry analysis of the fluid and cell counts revealed white blood cell count of 125, red blood cell count of 1,490 with a differential with the white blood cell count of 0 polys, 77 lymphocytes, 17 monocytes, and 5 mesothelial cells.
The pleural fluid glucose was 146, LDH 93, and albumin 0.9.
For the local pain of the thoracentesis site, the patient was given Percocet with good relief.
Bilateral lower extremity noninvasive studies were performed which were negative for any evidence of deep venous thrombosis at which time the Heparin was stopped.
His creatinine progressively improved from 8.1 on admission down to 6.6 on the day of discharge.
One final Chem-7 was checked before discharge, as the patient left late at night in order to check his anion gap, and it showed that his creatinine had bumped again to 7.2.
It was felt that the coffee-grounds was likely due to a small [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear given the refractory vomiting the patient had prior to admission.
