Layering blood within the left lateral ventricle temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] with transependymal extension.
As noted above, he had undergone head CT at OSH which was reviewed by our radiologists and was negative for acute process.
Patient was then admitted to the MICU, intubated and sedated, for further workup of altered mental status and nonresponsiveness.
He had EEG leads placed, and the preliminary read returned with no seizure-like activity.
Meanwhile, his blood pressures began rising to systolics of 180-200 in the afternoon.
At this time he went for an urgent head CT with findings described above.
The CT showed that he had suffered a large left cerebellar ischemic infarct, with surrounding edema and spread into the brainstem.
His blood pressure began to drop.
