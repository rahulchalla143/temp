At that time he had a cardiac cath where he was found to have instent restenosis of LM to LCx and ostial LAD.
His LIMA and SVG to OM were patent at that time.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: [**7-/2109**]: CABG with SVG-OM2CAD [**3-11**]: CABG with LIMA-LAD and SVG-?diagonal -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: [**9-/2109**] PTCA [**7-/2114**] PTCA of RCA [**3-13**] BMS to SVG-OM2 [**10-13**] 3 DES to SVG-OM2 [**9-14**]: DES to LMCA and RCA [**9-15**]: Repeat DES to LMCA into LCx [**11-16**]: POBA of LAD and LCx [**2-19**]: PTCA of in-stent restenosis of his left main into the proximal circumflex stent.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -Chronic Kidney disease stage III -Carotid stenosis 60-69% right ICA stenosis, 70-79% left ICA stenosis in [**7-/2125**] -DMII- last HgA1C 7.7 -Gout -PVD s/p aortobifemoral bypass -Depression and Anxiety  Social History: Retired.
PT 13.1, PTT 24.4 INR: 1.1 .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-11-4**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased and the degree of aortic regurgitation has decreased.
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are higher on the current study.
[**12-17**] CXR : As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal improvement with improved ventilation of the lung bases.
===================HISTORICAL DATA=================== [**11-4**] Echo: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-3-12**], the  severity of aortic regurgitation is increased (may be related to  much higher systemic blood pressure).

Last echo in [**10/2126**] showing EF of 25%.
Echo on admission shows LVEF 25-30% ??????
# CORONARIES: Patient complained of CP on admission and may have had ischemia prior to cardiac cath.
Patient underwent cardiac cath with kissing balloon dilation in LAD and LCx.
While in the CCU, he had angina at rest and dynamic EKG changes.
Cr on admission was  1.8.
# Anemia: His HCT of 28.6 at discharge is near his baseline for the past year or so, though still inexplicably low.
Fe studies showed low iron during last admission,  normal b12 and folate, normal ferritin, TRF.
Your weight at discharge is 150 pounds.
Start Carvedilol to keep your heart rate and blood pressure low 5.
Increase Lantus (Glargine) to 54 units daily, please check your blood sugars before meals and use the humalog sliding scale that you have at home.
