Admission Date:  [**2148-2-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2148-2-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2070-11-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU/[**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old gentleman, a patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who was referred with known peripheral vascular disease referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for lower extremity angiography on [**2148-2-19**] who was not able to complete angiography due to severe lower extremity pain.
Ejection fraction 25-30% with 2+ MR. 7.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 56, blood pressure 120/60, respiratory rate 20, saturations 100% on 5 liters.
Fingerstick 207.
Distal pulses diminished but palpable on lower extremities bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a cardiac catheterization and stent the day of admission with the final diagnosis of three vessel coronary artery disease, patent SVG to OM1, patent LIMA to LAD, severe diffuse disease of the right superficial femoral artery, popliteal, and posterior tibial arteries.
and had a chest x-ray to rule out any pneumonia.
Instead of being transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a repeat blood gas which showed a P02 of 64 on the nonrebreather again and on length of stay the patient had been 1,700 cc positive.
The patient had a chest x-ray which showed right-sided effusion and mild edema but no pneumothorax.
Eventually, his blood pressure improved and the patient was restarted on Lasix and Natrecor for further diuresis.
His hypoxia was attributed to pulmonary edema with also a superimposed pneumonia versus bronchitis as he continued to have gram-negative rods growing on his sputum which were never speciated.
Together with the milrinone, Natrecor, and the Lasix drip was able to diurese and the patient continued at a goal rate of diuresis of 500 cc to a liter daily and eventually as the patient started to respond and his creatinine started to improve, diuresis improved and his oxygenation improved.
After his creatinine improved and his renal function improved, the patient was restarted on his ACE inhibitor, continued and titrated up on long-acting beta blocker like Coreg.
The patient's creatinine at the time of discharge from the MICU was 1.0 and back to his baseline.
The patient had an exercise MIBI in [**2147-12-31**] with severe LV enlargement, severe fixed defect in the basilar portion of the inferior wall, severe fixed defect in the mid anterior wall, moderate fixed apical defect, mild partially reversible defect in the basilar portion of the lateral wall, severe global hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 17%.
The patient did have a look at his coronary vessels during his catheterization which showed three vessel native coronary artery disease.
The LIMA angiography showed widely patent conduit to the distal LAD with collateral filling of the distal circumflex and also showed a patent SVG to high OM1, 40% kink was present as the SVG passed into the pericardium.
The patient's CKs peaked at 1,085 on [**2148-2-21**] with an MB of 68, index of 6.3, and continued to come down from that level.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient had an EF of 20%, was diuresed as described above with Lasix and Natrecor temporarily on milrinone to improve his inotropy.
The patient's creatinine was back to baseline at the time of discharge.
NUTRITION: The patient was on tube feeds while intubated and his electrolytes followed closely.
