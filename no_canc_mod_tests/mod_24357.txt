At this time a large anterior territory STEMI was revealed on EKG and she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**].
LV gram showeeEF 55% with apical dyskinesis and non infarct zone hyperkinesis.
Review of systems could not be obtained as patient was intubated and sedated.

Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel disease.
The Cx and RCA were without angiographically apparent disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated systemic arterial pressures with SBP 148 mm Hg and DBP 94 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation.
[**2193-10-26**]:NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or vascular territorial infarction.
[**2193-10-27**] MR HEAD: Final Report MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2193-10-27**]  CLINICAL HISTORY: 59-year-old woman status post cardiac arrest, now with neurological recovery, but had questionable findings on the EEG that suggests mini seizures, please evaluate for any changes that suggest ischemia.
TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain was performed both before and after the administration of intravenous contrast with imaging sequences including: Sagittal T1, axial T1, axial gradient echo, axial T2 propeller, axial FLAIR propeller, sagittal T1 post-contrast, axial T1 post-contrast, and axial diffusion-weighted imaging.
COMPARISONS: Head CT dated [**2193-10-26**].
Multiple T2 and FLAIR hyperintense foci are noted in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, a nonspecific finding.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
Routine sampling showed a moderate encephalopathy consisting of mixed theta frequencies.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Cardiac enzmes elevated on admission, peaked at CK 229* CKMB 17.9* Trop 2.17 .
Repeat TTE on [**2193-10-28**] showed EF of 40%, apical akinesis and no LV clot or thrombus.
Patient had EF 40% on LV gram with apical dyskinesis and non infarct zone hyperkinesis.
CXR performed on admission showed no evidence of infiltrate.
Head CT performed after rewarming was unremarkable for bleed or edema.
Continuous EEG monitoring revealed questionable spikes that were suggestive of seizure activities.
MR was performed that was largely unremarkable.
Hct was trended and remained stable.
Iron studies with nl B12 and haptoglobin, high ferretin and low TIBC, with low reticulocyte index - likely anemia of chronic disease with inappropriate bone marrow responses.
A cardiac catheterization was done to look at your coronary arteries and found a total blockage in your left coronary artery.
You had an EEG that showed some mild seizures, you were started on a medicine to prevent this.
