[**2200-1-7**] CT Torso with NGT and IV contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
Leakage of contrast from the posterosuperior aspect of the gastric fundus with oral contrast present within the left upper quadrant and splenectomy bed.
An over the scope clip (12mm, T-type, OTSC) was loaded over the scope and the scope advanced to the region of the perforation.
An over the scope clip (OTSC) was successfully deployed to close the perforation.
[**2200-1-9**] CT a/p: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2200-1-15**] CT a/p: IMPRESSION: 1.
Given the change in JP output and a persistently uptrending WBC count, the patient underwent a CTA torso on POD 8, [**2200-1-7**], which showed a small gastric perforation along the greater curvature of the stomach.
CT a/p on [**2200-1-9**] (POD 10) with contrast via NGT showed no active extravasation, UGI series on [**2200-1-14**] confirmed no extravasation, and the NGT was removed on [**2200-1-14**] (POD 15).
Repeat CT a/p on [**2200-1-15**] again showed no active extravasation, and demonstrated a small residual peri-splenic bed collection (residual 9 x 2.7 x 3.4 cm subphrenic collection).
It will be monitored in the future with repeat CT as necessary as an outpatient to evaluate progression/resolution.
His central line was removed, and tip culture returned negative.
Regarding his pulse-exam post operatively, he had palpable distal pulses throughout his post-operative period.
