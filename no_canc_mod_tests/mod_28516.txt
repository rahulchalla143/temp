He went to [**Hospital3 7569**] where he was found to be in pulmonary edema with a SBP of 80-90 and O2 Sats in the low 80s.
An EKG revealed LBBB with no prior EKG for comparison.
Initial enzymes revealed a CK of 132, Ck-MB 36 and an index of 27, trop I of 1.41.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the ED the patient was found to have a HR at 104, BP 126/86, O2SAt of 100% on NRB.
A Plavix load of 600mg was given and Zofran was given for nausea.
Physical Exam: VS: T 98.7, BP 97/71, HR 72, RR 18, 95 O2% on 5L Gen: NAD, resp or otherwise.
Dry mucous membranes Neck: Supple with JVP of 10 cm.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ with bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP Left: Carotid 2+ with bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Pertinent Results: [**2198-9-23**] ADMISSION LABS CBC: WBC-17.1* RBC-5.07 Hgb-16.2 Hct-46.3 MCV-91 MCH-31.9 MCHC-34.9 RDW-15.0 Plt Ct-188 .

CHOLESTEROL PANEL: Cholest-169 Triglyc-111 HDL-45 CHOL/HD-3.8 LDLcalc-102 .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) with global hypokinesis.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Resting hemodynamic measurement shows aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 30mmHg and calculated valve area of 0.8cm2.
The left sided filling pressure is elevated with a PCWP and LVEDP of 25mmHg.
EKG changes improved with Heparin, Nitro, Morphine, ASA and Plavix load.
Medical management was continued with ASA, plavix, atorvastatin, added ezetimibe (lipid panel revealed LDL not at goal) and metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] as tolerated.
Was mildly hypervolemic following cath and diuresed well to 20mg IV lasix.
However to rule out infection a U/A was sent (negative), and urine culture was negative.
CXR was without convincing evidence of infiltrate (volume overload).
You were found to have had a heart attack, and were taken to the catheterization lab, where a stent was placed into an artery that was closed off.
