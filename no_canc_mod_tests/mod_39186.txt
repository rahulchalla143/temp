His initial peak flow was 150.
Initial exam showed poor air movement and diffuse wheezing.
However while he was in observation, he triggered for pulse oximetry [**Location (un) 1131**] of 88 % on room air.
He received continuous nebulized albuterol for an hour and on repeat exam, he still have poor air movement.
Labs on transfer were significant for WBC 13.4, Hgb 16.6, Plt 340 with neutrophilia and lymphopenia.

ABG on 5 L NC and 50 % FM showed pH 7.42, pCO2 35, pO2 70, HCO3 23, lactate 4.6.
A sputum culture was also obtained.
