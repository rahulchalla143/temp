Admission Date:  [**2139-10-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-11-5**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**] Chief Complaint: Intracranial bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG tube placement w/ endoscopy   History of Present Illness: 87 year-old French Creole speaking man with a history of HTN, Parkinson's disease was transferred from OSH with lethargy,  difficulty speaking for 1 day and head CT with left basal ganglia hemorrhage for further management.
head CT showed left basal ganglia bleed.
He was given 1gm dilantin, and received IV labetalol 10mg x4 for BP control, though was still in 200s for most of stay.
Labs with negative cardiac enzymes, INR 1.2.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Repeat labs here with INR 1.4 so no blood products given.
Repeat head CT essentially stable.

--- CXR [**10-27**]:A nasogastric tube remains in place, terminating below the diaphragm.
Workup there revealed left basal ganglia bleed.
Neuro: Initial exam showed right arm and face paresis and increased tone in the right arm.
Etiology of decreased alertness was less clear as CT showed only mild surrounding edema, no mass effect or midline shift, and initial labs did not suggest metabolic derangement.
Additionally, he was found to have aspiration pneumonia and a UTI, which likely attributed to his lethargy.
He had a repeat head CT on [**10-22**] which showed resolving hemorrhage.
His neuro exam on the day of discharge showed that he is intermittently alert, w/ appropriate verbal responses to his son (at times, speech still garbled).
Management of his BP has been challenging and has required sequential addition of anti-hypertensive meds.
He was on atenolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] and lisinopril 40 qd - here, he was given metoprolol 100 tid, captopril 75 [**Hospital1 **] (for low GFR, less frequent dosing), HCTZ 50mg qd, Norvasc 5mg qd with a range between 140 - 150s.
His BP should be <140, and would recommend further titration of his meds to achieve that goal for future stroke prevention.
GI - On upper endoscopy, pt found to have gastritis.
Prophylaxis - Pneumoboots, PPI  Full code   Medications on Admission: Atenolol sinemet 25/100 TID vitamin C lisinopril 40mg qd coumadin 3.5mg qd prilosec 20mg qd asa 81mg qd   Discharge Medications: 1.
