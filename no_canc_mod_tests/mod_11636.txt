Prenatal screens, B positive, antibody negative, GBS positive, Hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive.
Uterine size was consistent with dates until 32-1/2 weeks when uterine size was noted to be 31 weeks.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, this appeared to be a relatively well-appearing, however, asymmetric growth restricted term infant with a head circumference of 31 cm, 10th percentile; length 42 cm, less than 10th percentile, and weight 1750 grams, which is less than the 10th percentile.
Due to growth restriction, the infant was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further observation.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  The infant had early problems with hypoglycemia with serum glucose of 45 to 50 at times, requiring ad lib feeding of formula supplemented with 2 to 4 calories of Polycose in order to get him to maintain adequate blood sugars.
He had serum electrolytes drawn on day of life two which showed a sodium of 139, potassium 5.4, chloride 109, and bicarbonate of 16 at that time.
Hematology:  The infant had a hematocrit at birth of 63 with platelet count of 79.
His hematocrit reached a peak of 73 in the second 24 hours of life.
20 cc of blood were removed from the infant and replaced with 20 cc of saline.
The infant's immediate post-transfusion hematocrit was 68.6 His hematocrit the following day was 64 and that remained stable for one subsequent measure.
The infant also had some thrombocytopenia at birth with a platelet count initially of 79.
His most recent platelet count was 97,000, obtained on the [**1-31**].
His admission white count was 9.2 and he had a subsequent white count of 11.5.
His bilirubin was 16.5 with an indirect fraction of 15.4 and a direct fraction of 1.1 on day of life two.
After attempting a discontinuation of phototherapy three days after initiation, a rebound bilirubin was obtained which showed a level of 12.6, which was up from the prior day, hence, the infant was kept on phototherapy for an additional few days.
His most recent bilirubin was 8.9 obtained today; this was a drop from 9.1 of yesterday.
In addition, we obtained alkaline phosphatase which was 496, SGOT which was 64; SGPT which was 17 today and it may be worthwhile repeating these liver function tests to insure resolution of these symptoms as well.
The placental pathology, however, was normal, therefore CMV testing was pursued.
Results of CMV testing are pending and should be followed as an outpatient.
His white count at birth was 9.2 with 53% polys, 1% bands, 39% lymphs.
Blood cultures were drawn but were negative at 48 hours.
Urine CMV was sent and results are pending.
Neurology:  Due to the presence of some growth restriction, even though there was head sparing, the infant did have a head ultrasound to look for central nervous system abnormalities and this head ultrasound was normal.
State Newborn Screening Status:  The screening labs were sent after birth and showed a slightly elevated tyrosine.
