Admission abdominal/pelvic CT demonstrated findings consistent with a partial gastric outlet obstruction.
Given his history of advanced AIDS off anti-retroviral therapy and CNS toxoplasmosis, a head MRI with and wihtout contrast was performed, which demonstrated decrease size in the left basal ganglia abnormality and decrease in enhancement compared to a previous MRI performed on [**2153-9-21**].
Initial ECG noted sinus tachycardia without ectopy.
Pulmonary: [**2154-11-27**] CXR was unremarkable.
The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
The NG tube, placed at admission, was removed when the patient underwent EGD on [**2154-12-2**].
Repeat stool studies were sent.
Biopsies and cultures were sent as requested.
Last viral markers performed [**11-4**] revealed a CD4 count of 24 with a viral looad of 92,000 copies/mL.
Repeat CD4 30(3%).
Standard and Mycolytic cultures, CMV vial load, crytococcal Ag, and standard and specialized stool analyses including cryptosporidium, microsporidium, AFB, isoporidium were again sent.
Tissue biopsy, cytology, cultures for gram stain, aerobic culture, anaerobic culture, AFB smear and culture, fungal culture, and KOH prep form the EGD performed on [**2154-12-2**] were sent.
Urine culture from [**12-4**] also grew cipro resistant E Coli and he completed 7 day course of Ceftriaxone ([**12-8**] - [**12-14**]).
A lumbar puncture was performed and serum antigen negative, CSF antigen negative, suggesting that he does not have disseminated infection.
Even though he has had chronic productive cough without new changes, multiple CXR done during this admission were without evidence of PNA.
A CT showed high grade small-bowel obstruction with a potential transition point in the right lower quadrant.
After aggressive volume resuscitation, the patient had improving kidney function with baseline creatinine of 1.3.
Neuroexam was nonfocal throughout hospitalization without evidence of meningismus  Patient had both MRI of his brain as well as an IR guided LP ([**2154-12-4**]) that were reassuring and did not show evidence of disseminated crypto.
RML 3 mm pulmonary nodule A CT scan performed during his hospitalization revealed an incidental 3mm pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe.
He will need repeat CT scan in 12 months.
