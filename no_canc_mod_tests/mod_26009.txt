He underwent a CT scan which revealed narrowing of the trachea with a disruption of the tracheal ring at that same site.
The patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy [**2-7**] which demonstrated a proximal trachea fracture and moderate tracheomalacia.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2117-5-11**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2117-5-10**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
[**5-10**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**5-8**], there is little change.
This was felt to be possibly inflammatory in setting of recent procedure, however CXR was suspicious for a RLL infiltrate and the patient had a large amount of tracheal secretions.
WBC returned to [**Location 213**] and he had no further fevers.
Sputum culture was consistent with likely oropharyngeal contamination.
