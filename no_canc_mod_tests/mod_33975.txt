TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest, abdomen and pelvis following administration of intravenous contrast material.
Multiplanar reformatted images were generated.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post aortic valve replacement, and post-surgical changes are seen throughout the mediastinum, consisting of a small amount of pneumomediastinum, soft tissue stranding and edema, although without focal fluid collection.
The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, stomach and duodenum, and adrenal glands are normal.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Multiple loops of large and small bowel are within normal limits.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

On admisson, he underwent preoperative testing, as well as an echocardiogram and CT chest with coronary reconstruction to evaluate the coronary anatomy.
No hemodynamically significant stenoses were found on CT evaluation.
Pre-op echo did reveal a secundum type atrial septal defect (ASD).
Pathology of the excised, native valve revealed gram positive cocci with acute and chronic inflammation.
However, final culture of the tissue revealed no growth.
Additionally, CT of the head, torso and pelvis revealed no abscess or collection.
