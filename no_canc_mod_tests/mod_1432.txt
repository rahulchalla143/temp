Her recent history is notably for being hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 12089**] with fevers and culture negative sepsis presumed to be due to a line infection for which her HD catheter was removed and replaced.
She had a TTE which did not show any evidence of endocarditis, and as nothing ever grew from her cultures, she was discharged after completing 2 week course of Vancomycin, stopping on 6/31.
Initially very hypertensive but CXR witout fluid overload.
Blood cultures were drawn and she was given a dose of vanc/zosyn.
CXR suggested retrocardiac opacity, pt pt without SOB, cough, hypoxia.
A viral NOS/flu syndrome was suspected, pt was admitted on droplet precautions for flu r/o.
She had a trop of 0.11, during last hospitalization wsa 0.8.
INR 1.9 on coumadin.
She had a recent sick contact, and for the past several days had been having cold symptoms with productive cough and shortness of breath.
She was undergoing HD on the morning of transfer had became hypotensive with BP in the 80s.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2175-5-16**] anterolateral ST-T wave changes are not seen on the current tracing and the rate has increased substantially.
Echo [**2175-6-28**] There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
EKG [**7-2**] Probable ectopic atrial rhythm.
CT [**7-2**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Suggest HIDA scan or [**Month/Day (4) 4338**] with Eovist for further followup.
CT torso [**7-6**] CONCLUSION: 1.
Gas within the lower pole of the renal transplant is new since the previous CT, and is felt likely to relate to prior instrumentation, although gas-forming organism cannot be entirely excluded if infection is present.
Echo [**7-7**] IMPRESSION: Diffuse thickening of the mitral leaflets with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Aortic valve morphology and severity of aortic regurgitation are grossly similar.
Pus was expressed from around the patient's line and MSSA grew from blood cultures from that line.
No clear etiology was found through numerous imaging studies and blood cultures.
The patient was given phenylephrine to keep her pressures above a MAP of 65. .
The patient remained febrile and a CT torso was conducted.
It showed a distended gallbladder and an irregular HIDA scan prompted a gallbladder percutaneous drain.
The culture showed normal bile.
However, she had labile blood pressures and did periodically have need for brief periods of pressors during short periods of hypotension.
Starting on [**7-6**], the patient had consistent hypotension and new degrees of fever, and had a repeat echo and CT torso as well as broadening of antibiotic coverage to include vancomycin and meropenem.
The CT torso showed multiple infarcts in the liver, spleen, native kidneys and renal transplant concerning for hypoperfusion/infarcts.
An echocardiogram on [**7-6**] showed thickening of the mitral valve leaflets compared to an earlier echocardiogram of [**6-28**], and was unable to exclude vegetation, suggesting though not proving endocarditis, which was consistent with the clinical picture.
Microbiology results which returned after her death showed VRE-positive blood cultures from [**7-8**] and urine culture from [**7-5**] (resulted on [**7-9**]), with blood cultures returning as positive in the setting of having been on vancomycin, meropenem, and micafungin at the time, suggesting that the VRE (as is common) was not sensitive to meropenem, though specific sensitivity testing to meropenem was not performed.
The patient had an elevated troponin-T with a CK-MB index of 2.9, which remained stable.
An echo on [**6-28**] was unremarkable.
There was no plan for cath due to bacteremia.
Her CK increased, her statin was stopped with a down trend in CK.
Ultimately as above, a later echocardiogram raised suspicion for endocarditis.
She had fluid removed with CVVH and HD and had CXR which showed improvement in her volume status.
Neuromuscular was consulted and conducted EMG studies which suggested that the patient had diffuse axonal neuropathy and muscular disease.
