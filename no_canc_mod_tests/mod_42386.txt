After transfer to the floor, as confusion continued (pt was mostly AOx1 to self only) MRI Head was checked, which showed abnormal signal and enchancement in the hippocampus.
Myelinolysis, ischemia, or encephalitis was in the differntial.
Tap was negative for inflammatory cells, with cultures pending.
Lyme serology and blood cultures from admission are also pending.
Neurology also ordered a Voltage-gated K channel antibody test for further eval, and this is pending.
CXR x 2 was negative, urine culture negative, and multiple u/a's negative.
She has had no abdominal pain or diarrhea, and CT head on admission was negative for bleed or mass.
LFTs, pancreatic enzymes were wnl.
CT Head and CXR were both negative for mass (pt has hx of breast CA.)
Urine electrolytes were consistent with SIADH, and sodium did not improve with fluid challenge.
Delta-delta of 6 suggested underlying metabolic alkalosis in addition to possible AGMA.
Abdominal exam remained benign.
ECG showed no change from baseline.
Blood pressures normalized after receiving home medications, and it is likely that patient was not taking her meds at home secondary to confusion.
Baseline Hct seems to be in mid-30s.
Vit B12 and folate were within normal limits.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 169**] Elmhurst  Discharge Diagnosis: SIADH Altered mental status   Discharge Condition: Good, hemodynamically stable, afebrile, Na 136, AOx 1 (to person only), but alert   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of confusion.
You were admitted to the ICU for treatment, and transferred to the floor once your sodium levels had come up.
Your confusion persisted, so you had an MRI of the Head, which showed some swelling in your brain.
A lumbar pucture was done to check your spinal fluid for infection.
Cultures and viral testing are still pending.
They will follow-up the results of your viral testing and pending labwork.
