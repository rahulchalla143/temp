U/S of AVF negative for abscess; however, renal felt that if she peristantly spiked temps, then she should have tagged WBC scan to rule out AVF infection.

Blood Cx negative [**Date range (1) 99198**] .
**FINAL REPORT [**2173-5-12**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2173-5-12**]):       REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1238**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ 5:30A [**2173-5-12**].
RPR non-reactive [**4-26**] .
OSH ECHO: LVEF 45%, MV thickened with [**Month/Day (4) 61539**] densities which prolapse into LA.
3+ TR, PA pressure 51; RA pressure 15 .
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2173-4-23**]  9:59:44 PM  Sinus rhythm.
Poor R wave progression - cannot rule out old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2169-8-26**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
CT with contrast of head [**2173-4-25**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT with contrast of torso [**2173-4-27**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
There are 2 large vegetations (1.7cm and 1.4 cm in lengths) and a third smaller vegetation (0.3 cm) arising from the base of the anterior mitral valve leaflet.
Due to acoustic shadowing, this study was not adequate to exclude an abscess.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-4-24**], the mitral valve vegetations appear larger and left ventricular contractile function is more depressed along with inferolateral hypokinesis.
This study was not able to exclude the presence of an abscess.
____________________________________________ Tagged WBC scan [**2173-4-30**] IMPRESSION: Normal white blood cell study.
___________________________________________ CT abd/pelvis without contrast [**2173-4-30**] IMPRESSION: 1.
___________________________________________ MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2173-5-7**] FINDINGS: Again multiple areas of slow diffusion are identified in the white matter in the periventricular region including involvement of the corpus callosum.
Overall the foci have evolved since the previous study and no definite new abnormalities are seen.
EEG [**2173-5-9**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG recording in the awake and sleeping states due to the slow background suggestive of a mild encephalopathy.
Metabolic disturbances, medications, and infections are among the most common causes.
Brief Hospital Course: #Methicillin-senstive staph aureus mitral valve endocarditis - OSH blood cultures showed high-grade MSSA bacteremia and echo demonstrated mitral thickening with 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 61539**] densities prolapsing into the left atrium LA.
Ultrasound and tagged WBC scan did not reveal a source of infection in the LUE AV graft.
TEE [**2173-4-24**] showed a 1.7 cm mitral valve vegetation, moderate MR but no apparent abscess.
Repeat TEE [**2173-4-29**] showed 3 vegetations (1.7 cm,1.4 cm,0.3 cm) on the mitral valve but could not definitively exclude an abscess.
Daily surveillance blood cultures remained negative.
Daily EKGs and telemetry monitoring did not show any evidence of conduction abnormality.
Given their preferences, as well as high operative morbidity, that the patient defervesced on antibiotic therapy, and that a repeat MRI did not show further evidence of cerebral septic emboli, the medical team agreed to continue with 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy (through [**2173-6-4**]).
She underwent repeat nafcillin desensitization on [**2173-5-12**] in the MICU without complication.
She may benefit from surveillance cultures and repeat TEE at the conclusion of her antibiotic course.
#Cerebral septic thromboembolic disease - MRI of the brain on [**2173-4-28**] showed multiple infra- and supratentorial foci of restricted diffusion consistent with thromboembolic ischemic events.
Repeat MR on [**2173-5-7**] showed evolution of these previously noted acute subcortical infarcts but no new signal abnormalities.
EEG showed mild non-specific encephalopathy.
#Clostridium difficile colitis - Started on flagyl [**2173-5-12**] to be continued for 1 week beyond the course of nafcillin ([**2173-6-11**]).
#End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis - Continued HD Tu/Th/Sa with vancomycin given per HD protocol.
#Transaminitis - ALT 77 AST 123 on [**5-13**].
Therefore, planned to monitor expectantly and repeat LFT's [**5-17**].
