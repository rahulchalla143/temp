Pt had serial abdominal exams and repeat labs to follow her progress.
This correlated with the pt's improving abdominal exams and labs suggested that the perforation had sealed on its own.
Pt had melanotic stools and dark red liquid was coming out of her NGT.
HD#4 pt was given PT treatments and a stool C. difficile toxin assay was collected.
Pt was sent home on [**Hospital1 **] protonix and 2 wks of carafate.
