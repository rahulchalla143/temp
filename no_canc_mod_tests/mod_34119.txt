AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST.
AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE PELVIS.
PELVIS: Evaluation is limited by underlying trauma backboard.
Evaluation of the right sacroiliac joint is limited but appears normal.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
~~~~~~~~~~~~ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 85446**] Reason: H/O ASSAULT.
Wet Read: JMGw FRI [**2106-6-25**] 3:31 AM large left sided soft tissue swelling and temporal-parietal subgaleal hematoma.
CT HEAD: Axial imaging was performed through the brain without IV contrast administration.
If indicated, facial bone CT could be performed for better evaluation of these fractures.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
~~~~~~~~~~~~ CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 85447**] Reason: S/P ASSAULT.
Wet Read: JMGw FRI [**2106-6-25**] 3:31 AM no traumatic injury .
CT C-SPINE: Helical imaging was performed through the cervical spine without IV contrast administration.
COMPARISON: CT head performed same day.
The visualized outline of thecal sac appears normal; however, CT is unable to provide intrathecal detail comparable to MRI.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CT ORBIT, SELLA & IAC W/O CONT   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 85448**] Reason: bilateral to further define fracture .
COMPARISON: Head CT obtained approximately 10 hours earlier.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial images were obtained through the facial bones.
Multiplanar reformatted images were generated.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 85449**] Reason: assess interval change .
COMPARISON: Head CT obtained approximately 10 hours earlier.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial images were obtained through the brain.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
He was sent for CT Orbit/Sella*IOC which showed multiple facial fractures, CT spine was negative, CT head showed SAH and a large left-sided temporoparietal subgaleal hematoma.
Patient was evaluated by Neurosurgery service who initially had trouble with exam due to sedation and recommended patient be transferred to Trauma ICU (TICU) for Q1h neurochecks.
Patient had a repeat head CT on [**2106-6-27**] which was stable and showed stable SAH and subgaleal hematoma.
