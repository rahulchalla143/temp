IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**4-27**] through 6:  Previous small left pneumothorax, largely posterior, is diminishing.
Orientation of multiple acute left lower lateral rib fractures is unchanged.
FINDINGS:  Color and pulsed doppler imaging was also utilized to assess vascular supply to the kidneys.
FINDINGS: Direct comparison is made to prior CT dated [**2157-4-21**].
Since the prior CT scan, there is increasing air within the pleural space noted at the lung base.
Recommend a chest x-ray for further characterization.
Evaluation of the spleen reveals interval decrease in the degree of perisplenic hematoma.
There is a focal area of relative [**Name (NI) 33214**] seen on image #67 of series 3.
Pancreas, gallbladder, and liver are grossly unremarkable.
Small air is noted to dissect along the superior aspect of the diaphragm, well seen on image #35 of series 5.
Recommend a chest x-ray for further evaluation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-4-21**] 10:44 PM HISTORY: Skiing accident with known severe intra-abdominal injuries.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT  No priors are available.
Exam was slightly limited due to motion artifact.
Serial exams and his hematocrits were followed closely.
He was noted to have an elevated blood pressure; at home he had been on an ACEI, beta blocker and thiazide diuretic; these were restarted and his blood pressure stabilized.
It was felt that the rise in creatinine was due to contrast load from all of the scans he had undergone.
Pulmonary: [**4-27**] CXR - L apical PTX on CXR, monitored clinically [**4-30**] CXR - Decrease in the size of the left-sided pneumothorax since the prior examination.
