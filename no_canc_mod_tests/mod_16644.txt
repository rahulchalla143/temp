CT angiography of the head was obtained using departmental protocol.
CT angiography demonstrate no evidence of vascular occlusion, stenosis, or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size, although the opacification of the vascular structures is somewhat suboptimal.
Head CT [**9-27**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the inferior right frontal lobe (2A:11) are not changed.
He had repeated CT scans of the head, which did not reveal any new foci of hemorrhage, and thereby determined to be stable.
After his blood pressure was adequately controlled, his was discharged to home on [**9-29**] with appropriate follow up instructions, and new prescription for lisinopril.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day).
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
