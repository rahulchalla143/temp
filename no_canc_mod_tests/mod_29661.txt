Following aspiration of 400 cc of fluid, the amount of pericardial effusion appears small without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Based on limited views, global left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF > 55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2100-7-21**], the findings are similar (when compared to the post-pericardiocentesis images performed at the end of the study).
He was transfered to CCU for further monitoring overnight.

Continued Coumadin daily, INR goal [**1-8**].
PT/INR at [**Hospital3 3765**] on [**2100-7-26**].
