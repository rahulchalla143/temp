After a  MRI that showed a R-cerebellar infarct with hemorrhagic conversion and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] (as surgical backup is present).

MRA OF THE HEAD: Irregularity of the flow signal of the distal right vertebral artery in the vicinity of the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery could be secondary to a thrombus or a focal dissection.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY: The right vertebral artery is narrowed from its entry into the foramen magnum until the take off of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
CT head [**6-10**]: FINDINGS: There is no significant change from the previous study.
IMPRESSION: No significant change from prior study of [**2113-6-9**].
CT head [**6-14**]: Comparison with the prior [**2113-6-10**] head CT scan continues to show the mixed density large infarct within the medial aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere, also occupying a portion of the vermis.
TEE [**6-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
CTA suggests dissection of R-vertebral artery (close to PICA) although the study was not optimal.
A follow up TEE should be done after a month to see whether the thrombus has resolved or whether it represents a myxoma.
Amiodarone (Afibb), Toprol, spironolacton, valsartan were continued with adjustments in dosing to achieve optimal blood pressure control.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
INRs must be followed (started coumadin [**2113-6-15**]), goal INR [**12-22**].
Please have your INR checked and coumadin dose adjusted to keep INR 2.0-3.0.
