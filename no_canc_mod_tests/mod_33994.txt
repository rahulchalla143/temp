On [**10-9**], he noted a "warm" feeling in his chest which lasted seconds; there may have been some associated nausea but no SOB or overt CP.
At the OSH ED he was found to have a troponin I of 0.51 and CK of 89; aspirin, plavix and heparin gtt were started and he was transferred for further evaluation.
In the ED, VSS with HR in the 60s and blood pressure in 120s systolic.

CXR ([**11-1**]): 1.
TTE ([**11-1**]):  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Cardiac cath ([**11-1**]): 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed no evidence of systemic arterial systolic or diastolic hypertension.
He was transferred here to undergo cardiac catheterization which showed no angiographically apparent flow limiting epicardial coronary artery disease of the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA.
After his cath showed no CAD the ASA, plavix, and heparin gtt he had been transferred on were stopped.
He underwent a TTE which showed an EF > 55% and normal regional and global biventricular systolic function.
# EOSINOPHILIA:  Mild with absoluate count of ~1000.
You had a cardiac catheterization which did not show any significant disease in your heart vessels.
Also, the chest discomfort could have been from your reflux disease.
