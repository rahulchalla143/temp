Chest X-ray shows new white out of L lung and multiple alveolar opacities in R lung, suggesting multifocal, possibly aspiration pneumonia.
Lactate of 4.2.
Has R hip stage I decub ulcer, but no erythema or warmth surrounding lesion, so not suspicious for cellulitis - Bcx x 2 - UA and urine cx - paracentesis today p 2 units FFP for emergent INR reversal - increase abx coverage to vanc, ceftazidime, flagyl (in discussion with ID) for broad spectrum coverage.
Desaturation - ABG 7.46/27/88/20, A-a gradient 120.
Hepatitis C/Alcoholic Cirrhosis - active, with VL 84,300.
On [**4-1**], the patient had an ultrasound which showed a nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis, patent hepato-pedal flow within the portal vein, ascites, sludge within the gallbladder, and no stones.
His MELD score is 26, and he will need a workup for a possible liver transplant.
A paracentesis on [**4-1**] showed SAAG>1.1, AFTP 0.3, LDH 52, Amylase 19, WBC 76, RBC 114, polys 9, lymphs 32.
Repeat ultrasound from [**4-9**] shows reaccumulating ascites, primarily in RLQ.
Patient with new fever [**4-10**] and s/p EGD/colonoscopy with high risk of SBP - Diagnostic/therapeutic tap today.
2 units FFP prior to tap - continue aldactone 50 QD for ascites.
tox screens negative except for methadone.
Guaiac + stool/melena - likely [**1-10**] combination of NSAID-induced gastritis, thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction.
[**4-9**] EGD showed 3 cords grade I varices, portal gastropathy and colonoscopy showed diffuse continuous congestion with no bleeding consistent with nonspecific mucosal edema.
- fluid restriction <2 L - monitor daily Na - continue aldactone .
- patient sinus tachy, BP stable, no other signs of withdrawal - watch for signs of withdrawal .
- Received 2 units of FFP [**4-9**] prior to scoping - aldactone decreased back to 50 mg QD.
w/ known pneumonia - likely aspiration - this may be the source.
aggressive fluid management to maintain pressure - will need central access to monitor CVP for adequate resuscitation .
Patient [**Name (NI) **] continue to rise and MELD > 26, and will need workup for possible liver transplant.
Recent paracentesis w/o SBP - Consider repeat paracentesis give septic picture - Will continue to follow with liver - Will continue lactulose and refaximin - Will continue nadolol, protonix, aldactone .
## PNA - Chest xray suggests worsening opacities consitent with aspiration PNA.
- Will send blood cx, sputum cx (if possible), urine cx .
Will monitor BP closely, if BP drop will first d/c ACEI .
## Anemia - Patient Hct currently stable.
Patient with EGD and c-scope this admission which showed no active bleeding.
## DM2 - Will cover patient with [**Name (NI) **] and monitor blood sugar closely given worsening liver failure.
## PPx - INR > 2, PPI .
Levophed was started, but it was still not enough to keep MAPs > 60.
