Cath [**2166-3-25**] 1.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated native 3-vessel coronary artery disease.
Supravalvular aortography demonstrated all three vein grafts were flush occluded as was the native RCA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal central aortic pressure.
CXR [**2166-3-25**] FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate stable appearance of median sternotomy wires and multiple clips related to prior coronary bypass grafting.
There is increased perihilar vascular congestion and a few peripheral Kerley B lines, suggestive of mild interstitial edema.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %).
She went to cardiac cath soon after arrival to the cardiology floor.
Her EF was 35% on echo, compared to "low normal" from OSH in [**2162**].
Global hypo- or akinesis is consistent with prior data.
Her admission CXR was consistent with mild-moderate pulmonary edema on admission, and she had gentle diuresis early in her hospital course.
