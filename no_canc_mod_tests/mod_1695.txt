He was found to be hypotensive with BP 80/50.
CT abd/pelvis was negative for acute pathology.
He received  2L NS but was still hypotensive to SBP 70s, was started on levophed, and then received 2.5 L NS.
Labs were significant for acute renal failure with Cr 4.
[**Hospital1 **] labs were significant Trop-I < 0.06, Cr 4, HCO3 10  [**Hospital1 **] imaging showed CT Abd showing normal appendix with no free air, bowel obstruction, or gross intestinal inflammation.
CT Pelvis was obtained that did not suggest the diagnosis.
Levophed was started at 0.8 mcg/min with resultant BP 120/80, HR 95, RR 17, pOx 100 % on biPap.

His blood pressures stabilized while in the MICU, he was taken off of pressors and transferred to the floor.
There, his blood pressures remained stable throughout the remainder of his hospital course.
His respiratory status stabilized and after being transferred to the floor he maintained good oxygen saturation levels while on room air for the remainder of his hospital course.
# Acute renal failure Admission Cr 3.7 (from 4) with K 5.8 HCO3 10 consistent with primary non-gap metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap and superimposed respiratory acidosis.
Baseline Cr [**2159-6-22**] was 1.79.
No evidence of obstruction on CT Abd.
# Right Hip Avascular Necrosis: Patient received CT Pelvis to evaluate for Fournier's gangrene in setting of scrotal skin changes, was negative for Fournier's, but concerning Right hip changes were noted.
Ortho was consulted for further evaluation and management.
Given 5mg on [**7-31**], 5mg on [**8-1**], INR was 4.0 on [**8-2**], so coumadin stopped.

Because people who have atrial fibrillation are at a higher risk of developing strokes, we began treating you with a blood thinner known as coumadin, which can help decrease this risk.
