Diagnostic studies, including LP, CXR, UA, MRI spine, and TTE were negative for a source of infection.
He was felt to have had an anteroseptal MI based on EKG and elevation in troponin.
***    Past Medical History: Diabetes mellitus type 2 Dyslipidemia Severe aortic stenosis (Echo [**8-9**] at OSH: EF 65%, [**Location (un) 109**] 0.9, Peak gradient 70) Peripheral arterial disease Hypertension Pancreatitis, alcoholic S/p tonsillectomy.
Physical Exam: VS: T 97.5, BP 125/70 HR 108, RR 27, O2 96% on 4L Gen: NAD.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 10 cm.
[**6-14**] CT of Chest/Abd/Pelvis: 1.
Emphysematous changes with peripheral ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes, which may represent an inflammatory or infectious process.
This examination was not tailored for venous evaluation but there is suggestion of thrombus (hypodensity) within the right common femoral vein.
[**6-15**] Cardiac MR: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Bioprotsthesis has a mean gradient 9, peak 13 mm Hg with CO 7.1 post bypass.
Remaining exam is unchanged.
[**7-6**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**7-5**], there is little change in the moderate right pleural effusion.

Cardiac cath was deferred due to endocarditis/bacteremia.
He is now status post cardiac cath, which found a filling defect of the distal LAD not intervened upon based on its location.
TEE and Cardiac MR showed a vegetation on the Mitral Valve.
Repeat CT scan of Chest/ABD/Pelvis was done which showed increasing splenic infarct but no signs of abscess formation.
A CT scan of the brain was done which was negative.
This was followed up by an MR of the brain which showed several small infarcts, which are likely due to septic emboli from the vegetation on the mitral valve.
His creatinine rose and his lasix was held.
