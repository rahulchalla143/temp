As an outpatient the patient underwent ultrasound on [**2141-9-22**], which showed a 40 to 60% stenosis and his right carotid artery and a 20 to 40% stenosis in his left carotid artery.
He also reports a previous MRI that showed "old tiny strokes," but otherwise has no neurological history.
He was then admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for close monitoring following this procedure.
Cardiac catheterization in [**2141-7-11**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs temperature 96.5.
Blood pressure 158/58.
Pulse 67.
Respirations 18.
Satting 100% on room air.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 8.4, hematocrit 31, platelets 160, BUN 39, creatinine 2.8.
Chest x-ray cardiomegaly, large pericardial fat pad, no acute infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram sinus rhythm at a rate of 68, PR interval .256, right bundle, no acute ST changes.
Initially his systolic blood pressures were kept elevated to ensure cerebral perfusion several days postop.
He had a recent cardiac catheterization prior to admission at an outside hospital, however, this was a technically complicated procedure and his grafts were thought to not be well visualized during this catheterization.
Several days into his hospitalization he did develop acute angina and had minor electrocardiogram changes, which did resolve with nitroglycerin.
Given the patient's new unstable angina and his recent catheterization, which showed poor visualization of his grafts the patient did undergo coronary catheterization.
The catheterization revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
Subsequent repeat angiography showed these vessels to now be patent.
The patient was briefly on heparin prior to catheterization given his unstable angina.
Following the catheterization with successful angioplasty he was taken off his heparin.
He had no echocardiogram reports on file, but reportedly had an EF of approximately 30%.
Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of approximately 2.1.
He received intravenous fluids and Mucomyst with his catheterization and his creatinine stabilized and returned to his baseline prior to discharge.
His electrolytes were followed and his potassium and magnesium were maintained.
