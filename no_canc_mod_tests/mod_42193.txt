At ED, he had episodes of hypotension with SBP in 70s responsive to IVFs.
Labs were notable for Cr 1.7, worsening anemia with Hgb 9.7, Na 126, K 5.3.

Piperacillin/Tazobactam sensitivity testing performed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**]          [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].

IMAGING: CXR [**5-31**]:  As compared to [**2169-5-20**], the extent of the right pleural effusion has substantially decreased.
RUQ U/S [**6-1**]: 1.
Chest CT [**6-2**]: With the exception of minimal peribronchovascular ground-glass opacity in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe, the lungs are clear.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is present:  A right lower paratracheal node measures 1.1 cm.
Although this exam is not tailored for the evaluation of infradiaphragmatic structures, note is made of a TIPS stent.
RUQ U/S [**2169-6-4**]: 1.
Blood pressures were in the 70s so he presented to the MICU.
Cultures from OSH ([**Hospital3 **]) pleural fluid growing Pseudomonas, Staph, and GBS.
ID was consulted and he was started on vanc and zosyn until cultures showed pseudomonas sensitive to ciprofloxacin at which time he was narrowed on [**5-24**].
Pleural fluid culture from [**5-22**] grew GNRs in broth only so no changes were made to antibiotics.
He was transferred to the floor and continued to have blood pressures with systolics in the low 100s-110s.
Repeat fluid cultures here showed small amount of GNRs in broth thought to be due to catheter inoculation rather than true infection.
Chest x-ray the day after removal of the drain showed no re-accumulation of fluid.
This could not definitively show septations, and in the setting of continued fevers, CT of the chest was performed to evaluate further.
After the procedure his transaminases and bilirubin rose for 2-3 days, as expected, and then began to trend down.
Liver function was stable at time of discharge.
Amiloride was held during this admission, [**1-5**] sepsis.
