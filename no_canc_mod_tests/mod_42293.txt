Hepatitis C 2.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40% 6.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with an estimated 250 cc of blood loss intraoperatively; 1400 cc of crystalloid given intraoperatively.
Of note, the patient was also noted in the Recovery Area to be in sinus bradycardia consistent with past electrocardiograms with an average heart rate ranging in the low 40s.
Also of note, renal function studies obtained in the Recovery Area demonstrated no evidence of renal failure, but did suggest a prerenal picture consistent with diminished renal perfusion.
Renal study results were as follows - sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 106, bicarbonate 23, BUN 25, creatinine 1.1, glucose 132.
Cardiac enzyme studies were negative for evidence for myocardial ischemia and electrocardiogram studies were negative for any signs of acute ischemic changes, but were notable for sinus bradycardia.
She remained bradycardic with a heart rate in the 40s to 50s the duration of her stay.
