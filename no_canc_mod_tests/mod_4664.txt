A FSG showed recording of 34 but was corrected to ~150 with administration of juice.
ED: Her BP was around 80's/40's, after 1L -> SBP was >100 (baseline SBP in 90-100).
CXR - ?LLL PNA, left sided effusion.

COMPARISON: CT head of [**2180-8-8**].
COMPARISON: A series of chest radiographs from [**2180-10-19**] through [**2180-11-4**].
PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Since [**2180-11-4**], there has been interval removal of a right PICC and Dobbhoff tube.
There is likely some increase in the moderate-to-large left pleural effusion compared to the study performed nearly a month prior.
The cardiac silhouette is obscured on the left by the pleural effusion and atelectasis; however, there is likely stable cardiomegaly.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-27**], the degree of vascular congestion has substantially decreased, though there is still evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure and a large left effusion.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Pt with worsening wet cough and rales on exam after 6L positive on [**11-28**] to maintain SBP and UOP and with cold extremities concerning for cardiogenic shock picture.
INR reversed for PICC placement [**11-29**].
Nystatin 100,000 unit/g Cream 15.
