Lung volumes are low.
CXR [**2119-9-11**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing radiodensity in the right lung, predominating in the right upper lobe.
CXR [**2119-9-14**]:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the current image is taken in a highly rotated patient position.
As a result, hyperlucency of the left lung apex without definite signs of pneumothorax is seen.
Lung volumes have minimally decreased, but the pre-existing signs suggesting fluid overload have decreased.
CXR [**2119-9-15**]:  The lungs are now clear.
CT Head without contrast [**2119-9-15**]:  pending at time of discharge   Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: 54 yo M w/ h/o Down's syndrome, non-verbal at baseline, hypothyroidism, dysphagia s/p G-tube, h/o aspiration pna's, hypoNa on 4Lnc QHS who presents w/ cough and hypoxia from group home.
# Hypotension: Blood pressure on the floor dropped to 92/50 and he was transferred to the MICU where his blood pressure responded to fluid boluses (total 3L).
On CXR he has a possible right lobe infiltrate that could represent infection, pneumonitis or pulmonary edema.
At the time of discharge, his blood pressure was at baseline (100s/80s) and did not require pressors.
No evidence of CHF by exam or CXR.
EKG did not have any ischemic changes.
On [**9-10**] patient had RIJ placed and follow up CXR showed small pneumothorax but there was no change in the patient's respiratory status.
He was put on supplemental oxygen, and on [**9-11**] CXR showed resolution of the pneumothorax.
At the time of discharge, his oxygen saturation was high 90s on 2L nasal cannula.
# pulmonary edema: No cardiac history, but patient developed findings c/w pulmonary edema on CXR after minimal fluids.
EKG was unconcerning.
Myoclonic jerks observed after transfer from MICU to the floor, and EEG showed seizure activity.
Given his lack of responsiveness, head imaging was performed to ensure lack of new pathology.
TSH was normal.
Please follow up on his blood cultures and sputum cultures.
He may need an EEG at a future time.
Please check his sodium and fluid balance, as he presented initially with hyponatremia, likely secondary to dehydration.
Head CT read pending on discharge, may show signs of subacute pathology that changes his overall prognosis.
