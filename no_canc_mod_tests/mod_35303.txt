TTE ([**2177-2-11**]): Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with inferior, anteroseptal and apical akinesis/severe hypokinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-8-5**], findings are similar.
CXR ([**2177-2-11**]) IMPRESSION: Regression of pulmonary vascular congestion during the last one day interval.
CXR ([**2177-2-13**]) IMPRESSION: Interval development of mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion, and slight interval decrease in moderate-to-severe left pleural effusion.
Urine Cx [**2177-2-13**] - no growth   Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms [**Known lastname 30258**] is an 80 year-old woman with chronic systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with shortness of breath.
# Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: History and presentation consistent with CHF exacerbation - LVEF 20%, BNP 26,000 on admission, lung exam with crackles, CXR w left pleural effusion/congestion.
Cardiac ischemia ruled out with negative biomarkers.
Total net -2L in 2 days.
She will need electrolytes checked every other day in the future to monitor.
CXR notable for likely right lower lobe infiltrate.
After discussion with family, decision was made to treat with oral levofloxacin but not to aggressively pursue blood cultures or intravenous access for antibiotics, which had been difficult.
