Head CT at 6:15AM revealed a 2.2x2.1 cm hyperdensity within the right basal ganglia.

His exam was limited by sedation for much of his early stay, but he consistently had little to no movement on his left side, but would follow commands on the right.
A CT scan here showed progression from the outside scan, and despite normal coags, he was given Factor 7 as it was not known whether his bleeding continued.
His BP was controlled aggressively to keep his SBP<150.
He had serial CT scans which showed stability.
His ICP remained in the 7-10 range with the drain and when clamped, it stabilized out at ~14.
The patient was kept sedated as he became very agitated when off sedation and his BP would rise above goal ranges.
The patient requires further titration of his captopril up - current dose is 37.5mg TID, for goal sbp<140.
His WBC ct went to 14, but then resolved over several days on antibiotics.
Multiple sets of blood cultures were negative.
Multiple UAs and urine cultures were also negative.
He had a sputum sent which grew haemophilus and strep pneumoniae.
He also had a CXR which showed LLL hazy opacity.
CSF was sent from his ventricular drain which had a negative GS and 300 WBCs(but with 200K RBCs, so the ratio is appropriate for normal blood).
On [**7-14**], however, chest ct showed no R nodule, but did show severe emphysema, chronic LLL inflammatory changes and a LLL nodule.
These lung changes were clinically silent and repeat CT was recommended in 3mo's for follow up.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Ceftazidime-Dextrose (Iso-osm) 2 g/50 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1)  Intravenous  Q8H (every 8 hours).
Followup Instructions: - Repeat Chest CT with IV contrast in 3mo to follow LLL pulmonary noduleProvider:  Provider: [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1220**].
