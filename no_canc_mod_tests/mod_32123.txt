Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT perfusion images support a bilateral PCA territory ischemia, particularly given the CTA finding and clinical history.
He was maintained with a SBP of 130-170.
Therefore a TEE was done the following day which showed no thrombus.
His screening labs were checked and his A1c was 5.5, HDL was 31 and LDL was 57.
An MRI was done that evening.
On admission, CE were done which showed a mild troponin bump of 0.35 at the peak.
This gradually tended down and his ECG showed no dynamic changes.
Over the first 24 hours of his admission, his HCT dropped to 22.
It remained stable and iron studies were consistent with chronic disease.
His retic count was also appropriately elevated.
On admission, a CXR was done which showed a retrocardiac opacification.
During his hospital course, his neurologic exam remained essentially [**Date Range 1506**].
Another family meeting occurred between the CT surgeon, TSICU, Neurology and both the daughter and son.
The CT surgeon suggested waiting 30 days to evaluate his potential for improvement.
He continued to require ventilatory assistance via his trach and by discharge his respiratory support was CPAP with pressure support with PEEP of 5 and PS of 5.
His cultures remained negative and antibiotics were discontinued.
