[**2147-5-2**] CXR PA/lat: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
GI bleed: She was hemodynamically stable at the time of her admission, with Hct 35.
A bleeding scan was obtained on [**2147-5-3**], which revealed active but intermittent GI bleeding with a source in the mid-epigastrium, probably small bowel, first seen 70 minutes after isotope injection, consistent with a slow bleed.
Her hematocrit drifted down, and she was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs on [**5-4**] and [**5-5**].
After a discussion with IR and the ICU team, the patient's family expressed their wishes to avoid invasive therapeutic and diagnostic procedures, including arteriography or further endoscopy.
Her hematocrit, however, remained stable.
Please follow hematocrit, transfuse for hematocrit <28.
Hematocrit at discharged 33.
CXRs were negative for pneumonia.
Please consider up-titration if her blood pressure is persistently elevated.
BP at D/C 120-160.
An infectious work-up at that time was remarkable for a positive U/A, with culture eventually growing E.coli (sensitive to CTX).
Nutrition: Speech and swallow was consulted, and the patient failed a swallowing evaluation on [**2147-5-8**].
A repeat swallow evaluation was performed on [**2147-5-10**], which she passed.
A HIT antibody returned negative, and heparin flushes were resumed.
Her platelet count has remained stable over the past 5 days, up to 119 on the day of discharge.
IV access: A PICC line was placed in the hospital, and remains in place at the time of discharge for access and blood draws.
