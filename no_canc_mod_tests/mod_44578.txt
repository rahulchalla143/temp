Biopsy was performed.
The patient's hematocrit the next day was found to be 26 and she was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit came up to 31 and remained stable for the rest of the admission.
She was presumed to have had pneumonia, however, the chest x-ray and symptoms were never overwhelmingly convincing for this.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Afebrile, fluid repleted, taking p.o., hematocrit stable.
