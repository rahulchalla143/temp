On [**12-31**], Emergency Medical Service was called, and the patient was found bradycardic at home with a heart rate in the 20s with an idioventricular rhythm and associated hypotension.
In the Emergency Department, her heart rate remained in the 20s.
A chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.
Her potassium was 6.5, glucose was 350, creatinine of 2.8.
AST and ALT were elevated, consistent with shock liver.
Heart rate at that time was in the 20s with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 346**], electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus bradycardia at 40 beats to 50 beats per minute with a left bundle-branch block.
Initial arterial blood gas was 7.36/28/590.
INR was 1.4.
Blood cultures were sent.
The heart rate was then stable in the 90s on [**2184-12-31**], and the pacing wire was discontinued.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs at the time of transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor revealed temperature afebrile, blood pressure 166/80, pulse 91, respiratory rate 18, pulse oximetry 98% on 5 liters.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat revealed dry oral mucosa.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient followed commands, moved all four extremities, [**4-3**] and equal bilaterally in her upper extremities.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 17.8, hematocrit 25.5, platelets of 322.
Sodium of 131, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 20, blood urea nitrogen 22, creatinine 1.2 (down from an admission creatinine of 2.4), glucose of 184.
ALT was 870, AST 701, LDH 691, alkaline phosphatase 78, total bilirubin 0.6, amylase 170, lipase 588.
Calcium 8.3, magnesium 1.4, phosphate 2.2.
INR was 1.3, albumin 3.5.
Sputum Gram stain showed greater than 25 polys, 4+ gram-positive cocci, 3+ gram-negative rods, 1+ gram-negative rods.
Respiratory culture was pending.
Urine and blood cultures were also pending.
Urinalysis was negative.
Creatine kinases were negative to date.
Troponin maximum at 1.3.
Iron was 18.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray on the day of transfer revealed congestive heart failure with underlying chronic interstitial disease with evidence of increased cephalization compared to the prior study with the question of a left lower lobe process.
She was noted to have  a troponin leak in the setting of congestive heart failure and poor perfusion.
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which revealed evidence of global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of approximately 35% and a partially reversible inferolateral defect.
The Cardiology Service was consulted to evaluate regarding the echocardiogram and the patient's persistent tachycardia.
The Cardiology Service felt that because it was only a partially reversible defect, given the patient's other complicating medical issues, a cardiac catheterization was not indicated at this time.
PULMONARY:  The patient was maintained on Levaquin for presumed pneumonia and completed a 10-day course with a normalization of her white blood cell count and no fevers.
Her INR was elevated on admission, and this improved with vitamin K times one.
A speech pathologist will evaluate her swallowing in order to evaluate her diet.
Recommend outpatient colonoscopy to evaluate for iron deficiency anemia.
