Labs were significant for a white blood cell count of 16.7 and a potassium of 2.6.
Neurology consulted and her exam was notable for UMN pattern of weakness in the arms and legs, normal sensation, normal tone and dropped reflexes at triceps and right brachioradialis, which was suggestive of a cervical cord process.
It was also suggested that her hypokalemia could be causing a periodic limb paralysis.
An MRI was obtained and ruled out an epidural abscess, hematoma, and transverse myelitis.
Fetal testing was reassuring and there were no obstetric concerns.
Her ABG showed a respiratory alkalosis which was likely physiolgic secondary to pregnancy.
Her oxygen saturation remained 97-100% on room air.
Her potassium and magnesium were repleted and serial EKGs were performed.
Additional labwork revealed an elevated CK 5683 and an elevated ESR 35.
A lumbar puncture was done and was negative for infection.
A 24 hour urine collection was done and revealed 660mg of protein.
Her creatinine was normal (0.4) and a uric acid was ordered, but unfortunately was not done prior to her discharge.
Her blood pressure on the day of discharge was 90/64.
Mrs[**Known lastname 75380**] weakness had significant improvement as her potassium levels increased.
Fetal testing remained reassuring during this admission.
She had an ultrasound on [**10-20**] which revealed breech, BPP [**8-6**], AFI 17.8, and EFW 1433g(50%).
