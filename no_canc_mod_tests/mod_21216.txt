Admission Date:  [**2100-12-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-1-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2039-6-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old man with known three vessel coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25 to 30% who had a planned coronary artery bypass grafting scheduled for the morning of admission when he was noted to be acutely short of breath while undressing in the Preoperative Holding Area.
An echocardiogram at that time revealed an ejection fraction of 40% with global hypokinesis and a catheterization reportedly showed three vessel disease for which he was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**]  on [**2100-12-2**].
His initial workup showed troponin of .56 and a chest x-ray with bilateral effusion and a left upper lobe infiltrate.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25 to 30% by echocardiogram on [**2100-12-1**], borderline hypertension, recent urinary tract infection on last admission and recent pneumonia on last admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he is a pleasant well nourished, well developed male in no apparent distress.
His vital signs showed a temperature of 97, heart rate 91, blood pressure 114/62, respirations 22, and oxygen saturations of 92% on 76% face mask.
His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat showed pupils equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, and oropharynx is clear.
Carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally.
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally and heart is regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 with no murmur, rub or gallop.
His extremities showed 2+ pitting edema to the mid calf with 2+ dorsalis pedis and 2+ posterior tibialis pulses.
His neurological examination shows him to be alert and oriented and grossly intact.
LABORATORY DATA:  His laboratory data on admission include a white count of 19.1, hematocrit 45.5%, platelet count of 368,000 and sodium of 41, potassium 3.1, chloride 106, carbon dioxide 22, BUN 16, creatinine 1.1 and blood glucose is 186.
His electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 119 beats/minute with T wave inversions in V5 and V6 which were old and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V1.
His chest x-ray showed low lung volumes, positive for mild congestive heart failure and positive for bilateral effusions.
His enzymes were checked over the day and his troponin peaked at .21.
On [**2100-12-30**], he had transthoracic cardiac echocardiogram which showed 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation which was unchanged from previous echocardiogram and an ejection fraction of about 25%.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 123 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 91 minutes.
He also was started on an insulin drip for blood sugars greater than 120.
Chest x-ray performed on postoperative day #4 showed mild to moderate left pleural effusion.
He continued with diuresis and repeat chest x-ray on postoperative day #5 showed slight improvement in this effusion and it was felt that the patient was ready to be discharged to home with the [**Hospital6 1587**] services.
His discharge examination revealed vital signs stable with a temperature of 98.8, heart rate 78, blood pressure 100/67, respirations 20 and oxygen saturations 93% on room air.
His discharge laboratory data included white count of 12.6, hematocrit 27.7%, platelet count of 273,000, sodium 137, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, carbon dioxide 30, BUN 17, creatinine 1.1 and blood glucose of 93.
