Admission Date:  [**2136-3-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2136-4-2**]   Service:  ACOVE  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Transferred from outside hospital for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography of stone obstructing common bile duct.
She underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound that revealed cholelithiasis and a thickened gallbladder wall.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**3-29**] for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for this defect.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  Vital signs heart rate 72.
Blood pressure 111/51.
Oxygen saturation 92% on 6 liters nasal cannula.
HEENT examination pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Distant heart sounds, normal S1 and S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the apex.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION TO THE MICU:  White blood cell count 15.1, hemoglobin 10.6, hematocrit 31.6, platelets 362, MCV 84, RDW 16.4.
Differential on the white blood cell count 92% segments, 0 bands, 5 lymphocytes, 2 monocytes, 1 eosinophils.
Chemistry panel sodium 135, potassium 4.9, chloride 97, bicarb 30, BUN 20, creatinine 0.8, glucose 200, ALT 31, AST 45, alkaline phosphatase 210, total bilirubin 0.6.
CK 73, calcium 8.2, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 3.1.
Initial arterial blood gas 7.35, 58, 268 on face mask.
Oxygen saturation 7% with a met hemoglobin level of 22.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 9683**] for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2136-3-29**].
She was taken to the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography suite where vital signs were initially heart rate 73, blood pressure 125/59, oxygen saturation 84 to 88% on room air, which increased to 96% on 3 liters.
Initial arterial blood gas showed 7.34, 62, 136, but with a pulse oxymetry sat of 80%.
Given the discordance between PO2 and oxygen saturation repeat arterial blood gas with met hemoglobin level was sent.
She was taken back to the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2136-3-30**].
Her liver function tests were mildly elevated at the time back to transfer to [**Hospital3 9683**] with an ALT of 70, AST 62, alkaline phosphatase 493, amylase 15, lipase 9 and total bilirubin 0.6.
Her room air saturation at the time of admission was 84 to 88%.
Given this hypoxia on room air arterial blood gas was checked with the results as follows:  7.44/51/52.
Given her clear persistent hypoxia and persistent hypercarbia as evidenced by her elevating and increasing serum bicarb that was 35 on the day of transfer the patient was not self to be safe for discharge home.
Given that she has received the majority of her medical care at [**Hospital3 **] she preferred to return to [**Hospital1 **] for further evaluation of her hypoxia.
Specifically, it is recommended that she have a transthoracic echocardiogram chest CT to evaluate for interstitial lung disease and pulmonary function tests to further evaluate the presence of any chronic disease.
In addition her liver function tests should be monitored to be sure that they begin to trend down following her recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy for retained common bile duct stones.
