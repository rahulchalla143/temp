Labs showed chronic anemia, thrombocytopenia, as well as smoldering transaminases and a lipase of 193.
Given the elevated LFTs and lipase, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for abdominal ultrasound and surgical consultation for possible acute cholecystitis and/or gallstone pancreatitis.
Repeat labs were similar to those at [**Hospital1 **]-N. RUQ U/S showed gallstones with a positive son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign but no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, concerning for but not diagnostic of acute cholecystitis.

Dullness to percussion over dependent areas but tympanic anteriorly.
Sensation grossly intact  Discharge exam VS:  98.0 68-78, 104-117/70-81, 97%ra.

Limited images of the head and body of the pancreas are unremarkable.
Limited images of the right kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis.
Further imaging with HIDA scan is recommended to aid in this differentiation, if clinically indicated.
