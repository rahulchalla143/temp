EKG: Initial EKG: ST @ 117, nl axis, nl intervals, <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] dep in V3/V4 EKG #2: NSR @ 83 bpm, nl axis, QTc 472.  no ST changes.
Radiologic Data: CXR [**2154-7-29**]: Endotracheal tube tip near right main stem bronchus.
CTA [**2154-7-29**]: No definite evidence of proximal pulmonary embolism.
This exam is limited secondary to heart motion and evaluation of the more peripheral branches of the pulmonary arterial vasculature is not well assessed.
Cath [**2154-7-29**]: 1) Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed one vessel coronary artery disease.
2) Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
The cardiac output and index were preserved at 5.0 and 2.5 respectively 3) Successful direct stenting of the proximal RCA was performed with a 3.0x18 mm Cypher stent.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
Echo ([**2154-7-30**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Abdominal U/S [**2154-7-31**]: 1.
Microbiology [**2154-8-1**] H. Pylori Ab test negative Urine Cx and Blood Cxs and sputum cx were negative during this admission .
Discharge Labs: [**2154-8-4**] 05:14AM BLOOD Hct-30.2   Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o F with h/o CAD s/p anteroseptal MI who presented with chest pain and arrested in CT scanner, which required intubation.
Questionable V fib arrest - It was unclear whether patient had VF when she became unresponsive at the CT scan, our leading explaination was that she had a respiratory arrest after one dose of IV contrast for chest CT, in setting of vomiting and low bicarb, also some QT prolongation.
Her urine tox screen was positive for benzo and opioids, but she received versed and fentanyl during cath.
Echo showed LVEF >70% with normal LV thickness.
Ischemia - patient presented with chest pain, N/V, SOB and diaphoresis, although her initial CK and tropinin was negative, and ECG showed no evidence of acute change suggesting ischemia.
Echo showed >70% EF with normal LV thickness.
Intially chest CT showed fatty liver, and RUQ ultradsound showed normal gall bladder and fatty liver.
6 Anemia - She was anemic post-cath (Hct in the 23-24), iron studies showed anemia of chronic disease, normal Folate and B12.
Given concerns for GI bleeding, GI was consulted, but no EGD per GI due to multiple cardiac risk factors at this time.
Prophylaxis - PPI, SC heparin, bowel regimen .
