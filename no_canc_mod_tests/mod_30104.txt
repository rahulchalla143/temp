Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1) intubation and ventilation 2) right wrist arthrocentesis 3) bronchoscopy 4) echocardiogram   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 56 year old man with a past medical history significant for hepatitis C, on interferon, COPD, yearly pneumonias, with one in [**2163**] that required medical induced coma and ventilator for one month who developed fever and shortness of breath over the past three days.
In the ED, patient was noted to have a temperature of 99.1 on admission (spiked to 104.1), HR 133, BP 90/56, RR 20, and oxygen saturation was 74% on room air.
He had a white count of 7.2, with 72% PMNs and 22 bands.
Lactate was 6.3.
Chest xray revealed interstitial and alveolar edema, so he received IV lasix.
The oxygen saturations did not improve, so he was intubated.
Blood pressure was noted to decrease to the 70-80s, so he was given three liters of IV fluids, started on levophed, and transferred to the ICU on a sepsis protocol.
By the time he was tx'ed to 11 [**Hospital Ward Name **], his urine was clear and the foley was removed, although he continued to pass intermittant small clots (per GU this was expected)  Shortly after admission, he grew out strep pneumomonia in his blood cx's from admission and his sputum had MRSA.
Past Medical History: -Hepatitis C virus, genotype 1a (most recent liver biopsy was performed in [**2170-9-19**] revealing stage IV fibrosis and grade 2 inflammation); being treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin; most recent viral load not detected in [**2171-3-19**].
Past Surgical History: -b/l hip replacements -irrigation/debridement L hip -Ankle flap -CEA -s/p 3 lumbar spine surgeries, including ?
TOB-occas cigar ETOH-occasional IVDA-denies   Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: T:102.7 BP:107/61 HR:116 RR:29 O2saturation:98% on 70% FiO2, PEEP 10.

[**4-26**] CXR Lung volumes have improved since [**4-25**] along with a component of pulmonary edema, but there is still extensive opacification in the lower lungs and a suggestion of cavitation bilaterally which would be due to pneumonia.
If the clinical picture is not clear, CT scanning would be helpful.
[**4-30**] CT HEAD FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
[**4-30**] CT TORSO IMPRESSION: 1.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal(LVEF>55%).
Compared to the prior study dated [**2171-4-26**], tricupsid regurgitation is more prominent (may not have been as well characterized on the prior study).
Pneumococcal Pneumonia - Extubated [**5-8**] after failing multiple trials in ICU - O2 Sats were normal on arrival to floor - Treated with Vanco/Zosyn, now off both - Incentive Spirometry - Nebulizers  4.
Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Massive Hematuria due to traumatic foley catheter insertion - Transfused 7units PRBC - CBI was used - GU consultation - HCT stable - No further gross hematuria - GU notes may be several days of passing additional clots  5.
Hepatitis C, Chronic - [**Month (only) 116**] resume peg-intron as an outpatient - [**Month (only) 116**] resume ribavirin  Medications on Admission: -Spiriva.
