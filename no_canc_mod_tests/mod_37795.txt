HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old man with complicated past medical history including coronary artery disease, status post MI, CHF with an EF of approximately 35%, history of seizure disorder, cerebral palsy and mild mental retardation, who was referred from the [**Hospital6 459**] for evaluation after he was noted to have fevers, be hypotensive with increased lethargy and guaiac positive stools.
In the Emergency Room upon this presentation, his vitals were as follows:  Temperature 99.8, blood pressure 85/60, heart rate 101, respiratory rate 18 with oxygen saturation of 95% on three liters.
He was then given further fluids and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.
His vitals were temperature 97.3, blood pressure 89/47, pulse 99, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% on non rebreather, on 40 mcg per minute of Neo.
His HEENT exam was significant for a surgical pupil on the left, minimally reactive on the right.
On neurologic exam he had a left hemiparesis.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, WBC 10.7, hematocrit 33.3, platelet count 55,000, coags with PT 13.1, INR 1.1, PTT 28.6, sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 106, CO2 17, BUN 49, creatinine 4.4, up from a baseline of approximately 0.8, glucose 96.
Initial CK was 889 but an MB of 12.
Troponin was less than 0.3.
Urinalysis showed large amount of leukocyte esterase, small blood, many bacteria, 15 whites, 2 reds, 0 epis.
Chest x-ray was rotated and showed mild CHF but no obvious infiltrate.
His EKG was sinus tachycardia at 108 with borderline PR prolongation, left axis deviation, borderline left anterior fascicular block, ST depressions of 1 mm in V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit given his pressor requirement for blood pressure support.
A rule out MI protocol was followed and serial CKs did not show evidence of myocardial infarction.
Repeat EKGs did not show changes.
Chest x-ray was not consistent with pneumonia, however, during this hospitalization there was a question of possible microaspiration.
As such, it may be reasonable to thicken the patient's liquids until a full speech and swallow evaluation can be performed.
As such, it may be reasonable to perform outpatient colonoscopy in the future to further evaluate.
The cultures returned indicating MRSA and as such, antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin alone.
With the treatment of his urosepsis and maintaining his blood pressure, his creatinine returned back down to his baseline of 0.7 by time of discharge.
It is not clear whether this CK leak came from at time of discharge.
prn, Vancomycin 1 gm IV q 12 hours to complete 10 day course on [**2125-7-14**].
At time of discharge the patient's Lasix of 20 mg po q d, potassium supplementation of 20 mEq po qid were being held.
