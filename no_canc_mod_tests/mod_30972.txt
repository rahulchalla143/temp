Her DM is complicated by peripheral neuropathy, proliferative retinopathy (left eye blindness), and nephropathy.
Chronic renal failure: Appears [**2-19**] to DM and Cr has been 5 over past few months.
CAD - NSTEMI [**10-23**] in the setting of hospitalization for DKA, Nuclear stress test [**8-23**]: P-MIBI, without fixed or reversible defects, normal wall motion.
EF 72%.
Pertinent Results: ekg- ED - hyperacute T waves, lateral ST seg depressions, prominent J point elevations V1-V3 [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] - T waves appear less acute, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions persist in V4-V6.
EKG reviewed and thought concerning for changes compatible with hyperkalemia.
Anion gap initially 35. venous pH 7.15.
Electrolytes were checked Q3 hours and BGs were checked every hour.
Her potassium was initially elevated but dropped substantially with insulin and fluids.
Her potassium was greatly elevated on admission but was likely falsely elevated from extracellular movement due to insulin deficiency.
In the ED, EKG showed peaked TWs.
Upon arrival to the floor, she was given Calcium gluconate and sodium bicarb with resolution of her peaked TWs.
EKG in ED showed worsening ST elevations in V1-V3 as well as ST depressions in 1, aVL, V4-V6.
CKs and troponins were intially negative in the ED.
Repeat EKG on the floor showed resolution of ST elevations back to baseline and improvement in ST depressions.
She was started on 325 mg daily aspirin and cardiac enzymes were cycled.
However, as her cardiac enzymes were negative, these were considered nonspecific changes and no further interventions were pursued.
Patient should have an outpatient cardiac stress test as a repeat due to the demand ischemia demonstrated on admission.
