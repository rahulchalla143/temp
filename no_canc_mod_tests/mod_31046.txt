[**3-17**] ERCP: FINDINGS: Eight fluoroscopic spot views from an ERCP are submitted for review.
[**3-22**] CT abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
No definite obstructive stone seen within the cystic duct or common bile duct, though CT is not exquisitely sensitive for detection of biliary calculi.
Findings were discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2184**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2185**] at 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on [**2129-3-22**].
His BP soon stabilized after aggressive hydration.
ERCP was performed and it revealed a distal CBD measured approximately 10mm.
Blood cxs are negative to date.
In discussion with ERCP, a CT abd/pelvis was pursued on [**3-22**] given ongoing low-grade temperatures.
Fluid prelim cultures demonstrated GNR, but were still PENDING upon discharge.
Blood cultures drawn on [**3-22**] were still NGTD, but PENDING upon discharge.
In addition, he will need a repeat ERCP in 1 month for stent removal, sphincterotomy and stone extaction, when off of coumadin.
He was restarted on coumadin on [**3-24**] per discussion with IR; this will need to be titrated up slowly to achieve goal INR [**3-17**].
He will have repeat INR on [**3-27**] to help with titration; to be followed by his cardiologist.
# Acute on chronic sCHF - patient has an EF of 35% per discussion with his primary cardiologist [**3-16**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, and is maintained on metoprolol, lasx, and ACE-I.
His lisinopril was increased from 5 mg to 20 mg for good blood pressure control, as he continued to be hypertensive on his usual regimen (SBPs 160s).
# Productive cough: CXR with posssible retrocardiac abnl causing sx, or could be acute bronchitis.
A repeat CXR with PA and L was done to eval further the possible infiltrate and it showed signs of aspiration pneumonia.
A swallow eval was done and it showed no evidence of aspiration pneumonia.
His O2 sats were maintained at 95% on RA and did not desat with ambulation.

An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatiography (ERCP) was performed where a 7 mm partially obstructing stone was found.
Continue current warfarin dosing (5 mg 5x/week, 2.5 mg 2x/week) but this may change depending on INR test Sunday, [**3-27**]   Followup Instructions:   ERCP in 1 month at the Gastroenterology suite at [**Hospital1 18**].
