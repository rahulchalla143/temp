found to have a Hct drop from baseline mid-30s to 27.8 to 20.8 and an INR of 5.7.
rectal: guaic negative  Pertinent Results: Echo [**2187-10-30**]: LVEF=25%.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2187-9-5**], left ventricular systolic function appears slightly more vigorous now in the setting of tachycardia.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure was elevated in the prior study (not noted in the prior report) and remains significantly elevated.
CXR [**2187-10-30**]: Marked cardiomegaly.
CT abd [**2187-10-29**]: 1.
CT abd [**2187-10-23**]: There is a large soft tissue hematoma within the right flank and anterior abdominal wall, measuring 17 x 11 cm in maximum dimension.
CXR [**2187-10-23**]: Stable cardiomegaly.
ECG [**2187-10-23**]: AFib with RVR (110s), nl.
Echo [**2187-9-5**]: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Cath [**2186-4-10**]: 1.
The PA pressures were significantly elvated (PA 62/30 mm Hg, mean PA 42 mm Hg).
The PCWP was significantly elevated (mean PCWP 30 mm Hg).
Left ventriculography revealed an EF of 30% with severe global hypokinesis.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
K (10 mg x 2) and her blood counts slowly stabilized (Hct 29.5, INR 1.3).
Hypotension persisted, and due to blood pressure holding parameters on diuretics and AFib meds, the patient could not take these meds.
She tolerated gentle diuresis (40 IV lasix QD), and her SOB/dyspnea improved during this time.
Goal net output was 0.5-1.0 L/d.
will restart coumadin on [**11-14**], with frequent INR checks, in preparation for cardioversion in approximately 1 month.
