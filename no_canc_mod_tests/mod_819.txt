She did not hear from her throughout the day which was a bit abnormal.
He was then brought by ambulance to an OSH where CT imaging revealed a SAH.
Neurosurgery thought an intervention would not be helpful, and his CT imaging has showed appropriate evolution of the bleed.
Moving bilateral upper extremities equally; moves left foot when bottom touched (wife states he's ticklish); minimal movement right foot and mostly in response to touching left; toes mute on L and downgoing on R  Pertinent Results: [**2164-3-14**] WBC-16.5* RBC-3.75* Hgb-11.9* Hct-33.3* MCV-89 MCH-31.9 MCHC-35.9* RDW-13.6 Plt Ct-275  [**2164-3-14**] Glucose-128* UreaN-24* Creat-0.8 Na-138 K-4.6 Cl-103 HCO3-29 AnGap-11  [**2164-3-14**] CK(CPK)-100 [**2164-3-14**] CK-MB-3 cTropnT-0.01  [**2164-3-14**] Calcium-7.9* Phos-3.2 Mg-1.8  [**2164-3-14**] Phenyto-26.4*  DISCHARGE  [**2164-3-25**] 06:30AM    WBC 14.9*, Hb 11.4, HCT 31.5, Plt 462*  [**2164-3-25**] 06:30AM Glu 115, BUN 24, Cr 0.8, Na 133, K 3.7, Cl 97, HCO3 28  ENZYMES & BILIRUBIN [**2164-3-25**] 06:30AM ALT 215, AST 146, LD(LDH) 433, AlkPhos 86, TotBili 0.6  IMAGING:  CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECO NON-CONTRAST CT OF THE HEAD: The patient is a status post left frontoparietal craniotomy, related to the resection of meningioma, as reported on the prior study.
Extensive areas of intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and subdural hemorrhages, have not significantly changed compared to the most recent study done approximately three hours earlier.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD: Significant atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are noted in the intracranial arteries, in the vertebral, in the cavernous carotid segments as well as extending into the supraclinoid segments and the distal vertebral arteries, right more than left.
Small foci of air, noted in the left middle cranial fossa, extending into the infratemporal fossa as described on the prior study are unchanged.
Further evaluation of the neck vessels can be considered.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**3-17**]: IMPRESSION: No appreciable increase in extent of multi-compartmental hemorrhage with bilateral subdural hematomas, diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhages, and multifocal hemorrhagic contusions.
CHEST (PA & LAT) [**3-19**]: In comparison with the study of [**3-17**], there is no change on the frontal view.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**3-19**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Redemonstrated is extensive multifocal intracranial hemorrhage, including intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and subdural bleeds.
ECHO [**3-21**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2164-3-22**] Continued evolution of multifocal intracranial hemorrhage, with decreased density and conspicuity of blood products on today's study.
CT CHEST / ABD / PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2164-3-23**] 4:33 PM 1.
On [**3-14**], his urine culture also grew positive for coag negative staph, and he was started on a course of cipro for days.
Chest x-rays have been unremarkable, and a leukocytosis (11-20K) has been persistent.
Specifically, he has had negative blood cultures, urine cultues without an identifiable pathogen and negative imaging including repeat CXR and LENIs.
Given that he is hospitalized, there is always concern for C.diff but abdominal exam fairly benign and no reported loose stools.
TTE [**3-21**] without clear vegetations but Echo poor quality due to patient unable to cooperate fully with exam.
[**3-22**] RUQ ultrasound ordered for transaminitis revealed no intrabdominal pathology.
Upon discharge, all blood cultures were no growth to date.
Stool culture were no growth.
CT chest/abd/pelvis was obtained to assess for occult infection and revealed no evidence of an infectious process.
Additionally, given transaminitis, a hepatitis panel was obtained and was negative.
# Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: Noted on OSH CT with expected evolution per NeuroSurgery.
NC-CT head [**3-22**] with expected interval change, no worsening edema or midline shift.
Additionally, his Aggrenox was held throughout his stay and his BP goal was SBP > 100 and < 160.
As above, BP goal per neurosurgery is SBP > 100 and < 160.
Hepatitis panel sent as above.
[**Name (NI) **] Simvastatin given transaminitis but should be restarted as ; restart ASAP  # ASPIRATION RISK: Patient on aspiration precautions and s/p speech and swallow evaluation with modifications per their recommendations.
Volume status difficult to assess as patient unable to fully cooperate with exam but no peripheral edema, MM appear moist.
Urine Osm / Na consistent with SIADH.
# DIET: Consistency: Soft (dysphagia); Thin liquids  CODE STATUS: FULL   Medications on Admission: Aggrenox 1 [**Hospital1 **] Lipitor 20mg daily HCTZ 25 daily Enalapril 10 mg daily Finasteride 5 mg daily Synthroid 125 micrograms daily Trileptal 300 mg: 2 tablets [**Hospital1 **] Dilantin 50 mg infantab: chew 3 morning, 2 evening, 3 night  Discharge Medications: 1.
Insulin Sliding Scale Please use Humalog insulin sliding scale, start at fingerstick 150 give 2u, increase by 2u for each additional 50 increase to maximum 400.
Complete work-up of your fevers revealed no positve cultures or imaging.
- You were on Aggrenox prior to your injury, this medication has been stopped and you should discuss this with your primary doctor - You have been prescribed Phenytoin for antiseizure prophylaxsis, you will require blood work to monitor levels.
