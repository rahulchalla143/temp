Her head CT showed a 3.2x2.0.3.5cm R frontal hemorrhage and 4mm hemorrhage in R thalamus.

Sensory - withdraws to pain  CT head in am at OSH - 3.2x2.0.3.5cm R frontal hemorrhage and 4mm hemorrhage in R thalamus  CT head here unchanged 4pm - 31 x 21 mm acute right frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild effacement of the right frontal lobe sulci, unchanged compared to OSH CT 6 hours earlier.
CTA no aneurysm or vascular malformation  CT c-spine - 1.
Biapical lung opacities, right greater than left, might represent pulmonary edema superimposed on an infectious process.

No significant change in right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema as compared to the examination of [**2151-6-23**].
There is no evidence of nodular contrast enhancement outside of the blood products to suggest an underlying mass.
Its hyperdensity on the preceding CT scan is likely related to calcification.
Fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses are likely related to endotracheal intubation.
On MRI scan the patient was noted to have mulitple microbleeds consistent with amyloid.
Her alertness improved but she did not follow commands.
