CT T-spine, L-spine ([**9-19**]): IMPRESSION:  Unchanged osteomyelitis at T7-8 thoracic vertebra with retropulsed fragment at T7-8 that causes severe spinal stenosis and is unchanged.
CT Chest ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in size in bilateral pleural effusions.
This could be better evaluated by MR exam of the spine.
Spinal canal stenosis at the level of L4/L5, appears to be slightly more severe than the prior study secondary to increase in disc bulge.
Increased signal in the disc of L4/L5 is unchanged when compared to prior studies and is likely degenerative since there is no involvement of the endplates and is stable.
She got an abdominal / pelvic CT scan which showed worsening bone destruction at T7,8 retropulsing into the thoracic canal concerning for osteomyelitis.

Brief Hospital Course: Impression/Plan: 64 female with MMP, recently admitted with MSSA epidural abscess s/p drainage of paraspinal abscess and laminectomy of T12-L1, now presents with fever, tachycardia, and increasing back pain, concerning for improperly treated paraspinal abscess .
Her urine returned positive for enterobacter which was sensitive to cefepime.
MRI obtained on [**9-18**] showed worsening of osteomyelitis with new compression deformity of T7 causing mass effect on the spinal cord at this level.
Ortho recommended a CT of T/L spine to further evaluate extent of progression of osteo/abscess, which showed soft tissue mass at T7 c/w abscess, unchanged from prior CT. ID consulted and recommend CT guided aspiration and Cx of T7 paraspinal abscess to determine if she still needs IV Nafcillin.
CT radiology declined to do procedure because of level of abscess.
Radiology uncomfortable with performing CT guided aspiration of abscess given the level.
She did get a thoracentesis with the anticipation that her pleural effusions were communicating with her abscess, but the pleural fluid was transudative in nature and did not subsequently grow out any bacteria.
She was continued on Vancomycin secondary to fevers on Nafcillin, and this was dosed for a level of 15-20.
A subsequent UA showed Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, and she was started on Linezolid on [**9-25**].
Repeat CT scan showed stable abscess.
She is to get an outpatient MRI and she has an appointment to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**10-2**].
She did have decreased UOP after a contrast CT which resolved.
Diarrhea:  The patient has persistent diarrhea, and her C diff negative times 3 Flagyl was discontinued with third negative result.
Abdominal pain: During prior hospitalization imaging revealed no etiology.
Baseline Hct ~ 25.
She did receive multiple transfusions for Hct <22.
