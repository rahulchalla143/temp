Recent echocardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.8cm2, peak 87 and mean 53 mmHg.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization showed heavily calcified aorta and dilated ascending aorta, measuring 5.1 centimeters.
Angiography revealed a left dominant system and an 80% lesion in the right coronary artery.
Family History: No premature coronary artery disease  Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 126/70, HR 82, RR 18, SAT  95 on room air General: obese, slow moving male in no acute distress HEENT: oropharynx benign, no peripheral vision in right eye Neck: supple, no JVD, hard to asses JVD due to squat neck Heart: irregular rate, normal s1s2, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur  Lungs: clear bilaterally , diminished at bases Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds Ext: warm, 2+ edema, rubor present Pulses: decreased distally Neuro: PERRL, EOM not intact, CN 2-12 grossly intact, nonfocal, slightly decreased strength on left side, moves all extremities    Pertinent Results: [**2142-9-30**] 09:30PM BLOOD WBC-6.0 RBC-3.48* Hgb-11.0* Hct-33.6* MCV-97 MCH-31.8 MCHC-32.8 RDW-16.2* Plt Ct-191 [**2142-9-30**] 09:30PM BLOOD PT-13.0 PTT-37.5* INR(PT)-1.1 [**2142-9-30**] 09:30PM BLOOD Glucose-108* UreaN-21* Creat-0.9 Na-137 K-4.9 Cl-100 HCO3-27 AnGap-15 [**2142-10-1**] Carotid Ultrasound: No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis in the carotid arteries bilaterally.
Workup was unremarkable, and carotid ultrasound showed only minimal disease of the internal carotid arteries.
Antihypertensives were titrated to maintain systolic blood pressures less than 120mmHg.
Over several days, his heart rate improved as did his hypoxia.
Warfarin was resumed and dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5.
Serial chest x-rays were significant for improving bilateral pleural effusions with persistent lower lobe atelectasis.
Sputum cultures were obtained due to thick, green secretions.
Microbiology showed gram negative rods and gram positive cocci, for which he was treated with levaquin.
Ultrasound was obtained which showed no evidence of left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime: Check INR [**10-17**].
