CT cystogram without Contrast [**2159-9-26**] IMPRESSION: No bladder wall rupture.
CXR [**2159-9-28**]: There is blunting of the left CP angle, slightly more conspicuous than on the prior study.
An early infiltrate could be present in this area.
CT pelvis is recommended for confirmation and  characterization of fracture.
Please note that there is very limited evaluation due to portable technique and the other fractures seen on the CT are not as well seen.

Then on [**2159-9-29**], on POD#2, he continued to be tachypneic with RR about 30 and O2 sat of 93% on 3LNC.
CXR showed mild blunting of left costophrenic angle and possible retrocardiac infiltrate.
