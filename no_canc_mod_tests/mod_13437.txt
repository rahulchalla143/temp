Her blood pressure was maintained on dopamine and an intraaortic balloon pump for cardiogenic shock.
A rhythm was restored during ACLS protocol but systolic pressure remined only about 60 despite high-dose dopamine and norepinephrine.
Echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation consistent with probable papillary muscle rupture.
Echo earlier in the day showed no significant mitral regurgitation.
Blood pressure was unable to be maintained and she expired.
