In [**2146-9-21**] per report had a CT scan that was negative for colitis, stool studies that were negative.
Repeat CT scan per report demonstrated colitis, most prominent in sigmoid and left sided colon, without evidence of mechanical obstruction or ischemic bowel (per one report - but also demonstrated dilation of bowel loops in large and small intestine, no noted mechanical obstruction, per another report - awaiting fax of CT scan report).
Stool studies for c diff have been negative multiple times, but he was also started on IV flagyl.
His symptoms improved with these measures and the NGT/rectal tube per report had a lot of drainage, and after a couple of days he had his NGT and rectal tube removed.
Patient is therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management of his colitis.
Per report that examination demonstrated colitis involving the rectum, sigmoid colon and left colon, with edema and erythema.
Left colon biopsies demonstrated active chronic colitis with low-grade dysplasia involving the left colon.
Right colon biopsies demonstrated focal mild acute colitis without dysplasia.
Following colonoscopy in [**1-18**], pt was treated with prednisone at that time with improvement of symptoms.

Comparison with prior study is recommended if available.
Again comparison with prior study would be useful for establishing stability.
In this patient with history of prostate cancer, correlation with bone scan would be recommended in the absence of prior study to establish stability.
CT a/p c contrast [**11-30**] 1.
================== [**2146-11-27**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right subclavian PICC line that extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
ABD plain film [**2146-11-30**] IMPRESSION: Marked gaseous distention of the colon, with the transverse colon measuring up to 8 cm.
[**12-6**] Chest CT noncontrast: 1.
Bone Scan [**12-5**] 1.
Anatomic imaging is recommended as clinically indicated.
No corresponding abnormal uptake in the lower thoracic or lumbar spine to correlate with CT findings.
He had a repeat CT scan here that demonstrated bowel wall edema from anus to sigmoid colon.
He therefore underwent a sigmoidoscopy for further evaluation that demonstrated very friable erythematous mucosa consistent with colitis.
He continued on bowel rest and IV solumedrol until [**2146-12-1**], when repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy showed worsened friable mucosa and colitis.
CT chest with multifocal opacities thought due to infection.
Sputum cultures were positive for Aspergillous.
Bronchoscopy was performed and BAL was negative for PCP.
DVT, RLE: incidental finding on CT scan.
Coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction: During the hospital course he was kept on ASA 81 and beta-blocker when he tolerated it.
