PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.7.
Blood pressure 100/60.
Respiratory rate 15.
Heart rate 100.
Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Tone in the right arm is decreased, but increased in the right and left legs.
Reflexes 1+ on the right arm and right leg.
Note that this examination is as noted by the author and is worse then the examination noted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 102587**] and [**Doctor Last Name 1004**] previously where they show that the patient was more alert and responsive and able to follow commands more readily with right sided hemiparesis, but mild.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 13, hematocrit 38.8, platelets 307, INR 1.3, sodium 137, potassium 2.7, chloride 95, bicarb 27, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 123, CK 104, 103, MB 1 and 3, troponin less then 0.3 times two.
Perfusion study revealed a defect t hat extende that seen on diffusion.
Given the mismatch in the perfusion and diffusion imaging sequences we f elt that Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] likely has ischemic and stunned neuronal tissue that may be salvaged if a perfusion can be maintained with hig h pressures.
He was initially started on neo-synephrine to maintain his systolic blood pressure between 160 and 190.
However, escalating doses of neo-synephrine was ineffective in maintaining his blood pressure and therefore he was switched to Levophed with good results.
Cardiac echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction greater then 55% without significant wall motion abnormalities.
Carotid duplex revealed significant plaque in the cervical left ICA and minimal disease in the right carotids.
The right peak systolic velocities suggest less then 40% stenosis.
Therefore further studies with an angiogram was done and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] performed this procedure, which revealed a proximal left MCA occlusion.
Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] was subsequently weaned off pressor support with blood pressures maintained at adequate levels.
While in the Intensive Care Unit Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] was found to have a urinary tract infection with cultures growing enterococcus species and staph coag negative species.
Sputum cultures also revealed staph aureus, which was felt to be colonization and therefore Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] was not started on antibiotics.
However, on the day of this dictation Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] had a temperature of 101.8.
Blood, urine and sputum cultures were resent and I recommended starting Vancomycin to cover for staph aureus.
