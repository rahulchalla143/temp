[**2170-4-6**] CT ABD/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST: 1.
Recommend CT for further evaluation.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Upon arrival to the MICU, her oxygen saturation dropped to 80% on 100% NRB.
Chest films were consistent with ARDS versus pulmonary edema.
Pelvic exam was unremarkable as well as pelvic ultrasound.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis raised concern for appendicitis versus intra-abdominal abscess.
She underwent exploratory laparotomy which demonstrated serous fluid without evidence of bowel pathology.
Eventually, her cultures from the OSH grew pan-sensitive E. coli and the patient was transitioned to levofloxacin.
All cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] were negative.
However, LP at the OSH and echocardiogram were negative.
