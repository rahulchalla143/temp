A HIDA scan was performed and revealed a bile leak.
A CT scan was performed as well and this revealed bilateral atelectasis and free fluid in the gallbladder fossa and in the right paracolic gutter.

He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a repeat ERCP.

[**2151-4-18**] GALLBLADDER SCAN: Serial images over the abdomen show uptake of tracer into the hepatic parenchyma.
Brief Hospital Course: 26M with bile leak seen on HIDA scan s/p lap chole from [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH after ERCP stenting of his pancreatic duct (unable to cannulate the CBD at [**Hospital6 302**]), presenting with evidence of acute pancreatitis.
A CT showed free fluid within the right upper quadrant tracking in the bilateral paracolic gutters and into the pelvis, but likely simple fluid density.
His Lipase decreased from 1800 initially to 1600 and then 247.
His lipase was down to 72 with improved abdominal tenderness.
He had no abdominal complaints and his laboratory studies were reassuring.
