Her post-operative course was complicated by a new O2 requirement (low 90s on 4L NC on call-out) likely due to decompensated CHF in the setting of COPD, low grade post-op fever to 100.5, delerium, typical CP ruled out for MI and tachycardic with persistent O2 requirement concerning for PE that was also ruled out by CTPA.
She was also been seen by ophthalmology for a corectopic right pupil, which is due to an anterior chamber itraocular lens (AC-IOL).

Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is partially due to the projection and low lung volumes.
[**10-16**] CXR Port: Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**10-17**] CXR PA-L: IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Please note cervical hardware appears grossly normal; however, a chest x-ray is not the recommended modality for evaluation of this hardware and consider dedicated C-spine radiographs for more appropriate evaluation.
[**10-16**] C-Spine: compared to CT from [**2110-5-30**].

Cervical laminectomies, C4, C5, and C6.
Arthrodesis, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7.
Instrumentation, C3 to C7, nonsegmental.
# Post-operative hypoxia due decompensated dCHF: Patient admitted with known diastolyic dysfunction according to previous ECHO from 9/[**2108**].
Post-operatively she became hypervolemic due to IVF and was transferred in respiratory distress on NRB to the MICU for close monitoring and diuresis; CXR at that time was equivocal for possible infiltrate and the patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible CA-PNA.
In the ICU, the patient complained of typical chest pain; EKG showed no ischemic changes and serial cardiac enzymes were flat; ECHO was unchanged from previous study.
# Post-operative sinus tachycardia concerning for PE: The patient remained persistently tachycardic the first day on the floor in the setting of hypoxia, requiring 4L NC to maintain sats in the low 90s, satting low 80s on RA.
Diuresis was stopped and oral rehydration was encouraged, with Cr showing a trend toward normalization to 1.7 the day of discharge from a peak of 2.5. .
Rehab medication instruction Please restart Lisinopril 30mg dailyt as previously prescribed after Cr returns to baseline of 1.3  Please restart Metformin 500mg SR daily when Cr returns to baseline of 1.3  Please restart relafen 750mg [**Hospital1 **] with food when Cr returns to baseline   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] manor  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: -Spinal stenosis -c4-c6 decompression with c3-c7 fusion for spinal stenosis -Hypoxia due to intravenous fluids -Acute kidney injury due to medication induced dehydration -chronic heart failure  Secondary Diagnoses: -Type 2 Diabetes -Hypothyroid -COPD -Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
