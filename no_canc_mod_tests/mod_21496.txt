Paracentesis [**9-19**]  History of Present Illness: 35 yo woman transferred from OSH with sepsis.
Her physical examination was reportedly noteworthy for mild lethargy, slightly dry mucous membranes, and no meningeal signs; her exam was reportedly otherwise unremarkable.
Her labs were noteworthy for a WBC of 16.6 (75 PMN, 20 bands, 3 monos, 2 eos), Hct 36.1 (baseline high 20's), plt 31 (baseline low 40's); Na 130, no anion gap, albumin 2.7, INR 1.9, AST 80, ALT 81, alk phos 146, bili 2.6 (direct 0.85).
U/A hazy, 3+ blood, 15-25 RBC, no WBC/bacteria.
Two units FFP were given prior to a diagnostic paracentesis that reportedly demonstrated ~2300 WBC with 87% PMN.
A head CT was reportedly normal.
OSH blood cxs were already growing gram negative rods by time of arrival here.

An LP was preformed revealing no WBC's.
Blood and urine cx's did not grow out anything.
Blood cultures from the OSH however, grew out Klebsiella x2, sensitive to Levofloxacin, but only intermediately sensitive to Cefoxitin, so her Ceftriaxone was switched to Levofloxacin.
A repeat paracentesis was preformed on HD2 which revealed ~1100 WBCs, down from 2300 at prior to admission.
Because the WBC decline was not as substantial as anticipated on Levofloxcin, Flagyl and Vancomycin were continued.
The patient did not have a repeat paracentesis because her white count continued to decline.
Head CT was preformed and was negative.
Ammonia levels were checked given her history of cirrhosis, and returned only mildly elevated at 49.
Serum and urine tox screens were negative.
Lasix was held pts ARF resolved, with Cr returning to 1.0 and brisk UOP daily.
Her admission INR of 2.3 improved daily back to her baseline of 1.5 with hydration.
Her DIC labs were followed daily and were within normal range.
She received an albumin infusion on HD 1 and 3 per SBP protocol to prevent hepatorenal syndrome sequelae.
On her last day of ICU stay, her INR rose to 2.0.
Given that she was NPO for several days, this was thought to be secondary to malnutrition, and she was given Vit K. However, the patient had repeated doses of vitamin K over a few days and her INR failed to respond.
HCT decreased progressively to 19 on HD2 with guaiac + stools and NG lavage with blood clots.
Plt levels continued to drop during hospital course, with no evidence of obvious bleed or hemolysis.
Pt was transfused to keep Plts >50 prior to invasive procedure, otherwise >10K unless suspicion for active bleed.
Transaminitis: Most likely due to mild tissue hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis, although liver enzymes may be elevated due to cholangitis as noted above.
Her vision was unaffected, and her platelets were kept > 50 to prevent further bleeding.
HTN: post-extubation pts BP rose gradually from SBP 130's to 170's.
This was stopped on discharge because the patient's blood pressure was slightly low and she has no documented history of varices.
This was accompanied by an amylase of 133 and lipase of 228.
F/E/N: Initial exam and labs were consistent with intravascular volume depletion.
