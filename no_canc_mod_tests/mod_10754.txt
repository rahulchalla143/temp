Surveillance liver function study tests by the patient's primary care physician demonstrated an increased alkaline phosphatase earlier this year; follow-up endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was notable for minimally and common bile duct narrowing, consistent with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
The patient's liver function tests were noted to acutely worsen in [**2178-9-15**], with a subsequent second endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography conducted on [**2178-9-23**] which demonstrated distorted intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts and focal narrowing of the right, left and common hepatic duct near the cystic duct remnant.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2178-10-21**] was notable for intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and atrophic left hepatic lobe.
A needle core biopsy conducted the same day demonstrated features consistent with primary sclerosing cholangitis and no evidence of malignancy.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was conducted on [**2178-10-22**] for investigation of an incidental CT finding of soft tissue density in the esophagus; this soft tissue was determined to be grade I varices at the lower one-third of the esophagus and at the gastroesophageal junction.
A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2178-11-3**] demonstrated persistent varices with an additional finding of a hiatal hernia, antral gastritis, and a reactive inflammation of the mediastinal lymph nodes.
The patient was subsequently scheduled for an exploratory laparotomy, left hepatic resection, and Roux-en-Y hepatic jejunostomy for [**2178-10-16**].
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography times two.
The patient reportedly sold his business, but still works regularly.
Intraoperatively, the patient also demonstrated a total urine output of approximately 630 cc.
Postoperatively, the patient was noted to be stable and was subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring and admitted to the Blue Surgery service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient was administered a 500 cc bolus of normal saline secondary to a transiently diminished systolic blood pressure, at which point his epidural rate was adjusted from 8 cc to 6 cc per hour.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains, both medial and lateral, were noted to be intact and patent and right and left biliary drainage were noted to be intact and patent as well.
On the evening of postoperative day number two, the patient was noted to have transient elevations in temperature with a maximum temperature of 101.1.
At this point, his wound dressing was removed and his suture line examined; wound evaluation revealed a clean abdominal incision with intact staples with mild serous drainage from the floor right extent of the wound.
On postoperative day number three, the patient was successfully transitioned to oral pain medication, provided via Percocet,  The patient was also transfused two units of blood for a hematocrit of 26.4 and demonstrated an appropriate post transfusion hematocrit increased to 33.1 on subsequent blood draw.
Near the completion of receipt of his second unit of blood, the demonstrated a transient increase in his temperature to 109.9.
Two sets of blood cultures and one set of urinary cultures were subsequently obtained; as of the time of this dictation, the patient's urine culture demonstrated no growth and his blood cultures are still pending.
His abdominal examination demonstrated a soft, nontender and nondistended abdomen; the patient's dressing was noted to be clean, dry and intact with no drainage or saturation.
Incisional examination demonstrated decreasing peri-incisional erythema with no evidence of active drainage and staples intact.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain and biliary drain were noted to be intact and patent throughout.
