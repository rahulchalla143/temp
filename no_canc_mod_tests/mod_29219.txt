Additionally, BP increased transiently to 190/90; O2sat 89% on RA.
CXR showed mild flash pulmonary edema.
MICU evaluation requested due to respiratory distress.
On evaluation, VS were stable with normalized BP, O2 sats 100% on BiPAP.
Furosemide 200 mg IV administered per renal recs and pt was transferred to MICU.
