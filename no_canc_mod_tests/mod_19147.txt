# Ostomy wound and skin breakdown - patient was evaluated in the ED with a CT scan showing flow through the ostomy without any entero-cutaneous fistulas.
Surgery was following along and did serial exams that were not concerning for an acute abdomen.
# UTI - had positive UA but culture grew yeast and was likely a contaminant.
We held the metformin because of her CKD and put her on insulin sliding scale.
# CKD - seems to be at baseline, but creatinine has been variable past few months.
Received some IVFs the night prior to CT scan, and creatinine was not rechecked because she refused labs every time.
An NGT was placed secondary to N/V and decreased ostomy output.
Here G-tube was than removed, however it was noted that there was output from the g-tube site and a CT scan was done.
