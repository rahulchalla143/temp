The patient had an echocardiogram in [**2127-7-4**], which was done as part of aortic stenosis screening, which revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction of 60%, with transvalvular mean pressure of 65 and aortic valve area of 0.45.
Repeat echocardiogram on [**2127-10-17**], revealed dilated left atrium and right atrium, ejection fraction of 55%, mean gradient of 92 and a valve area of 0.5 centimeter squared.
Due to these symptoms and aortic stenosis, the patient was referred for cardiac catheterization, which he underwent on [**2127-1-19**], which revealed an aortic valve gradient of 35.8 and a valve area of 0.64.
Additionally, the catheterization revealed his native three vessel disease and additionally an occlusion of the left anterior descending distal to the touchdown of his saphenous vein graft and an 80% stenosis in the proximal obtuse marginal three.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, heart rate was 76, blood pressure 149/85, oxygen saturation 99% in room air.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 70 beats per minute, normal axis, slightly long Q-Tc, peaked T waves in II, III, V2, V3 and V4, upsloping ST elevation in V2.
Cardiac catheterization [**2127-11-18**], showed worsening native disease, patent grafts with an occluded left anterior descending distal to the touchdown of the saphenous vein graft, 80% stenosis in the proximal obtuse marginal three, two serial 90% stenoses in the obtuse marginal two proximal to the saphenous vein graft touchdown.
Hemodynamics showed wedge 35/30, cardiac output 3.8, cardiac index 2.0, SVR 18/32.
Chest x-ray from [**2127-11-13**], showed mild congestive heart failure.
Sodium 140, potassium 4.8, chloride 107, bicarbonate 24, blood urea nitrogen 36, creatinine 1.5 with baseline 1.1 to 1.3, glucose 64.
White blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit 30.9, platelet count 195,000.
INR 3.4, partial thromboplastin time 45.2.
Aortic stenosis - In terms of the patient's critical aortic stenosis leading to his congestive heart failure, a CT surgery consultation was obtained for the question of aortic valve replacement.
His Coumadin was held initially for his cardiac catheterization and he was therefore post catheterization maintained on a Heparin drip until the decision regarding cardiothoracic surgery was made.
Once the decision was made that he would not be undergoing the surgery during this hospitalization, Coumadin was restarted with a goal INR of greater than 2.0.
Early in his hospital course, the patient was well rate controlled, however, later in his course, he started having heart rates above 100.
