[**2177-1-6**] 5:10 am BLOOD CULTURE     Site: ARM AEROBIC BOTTLE (Pending): ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Pending):   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 86yo man with h/o CAD, DM2, HTN, CRI, pancytopenia, a/w hypothermia, bradycardia, profound pancytopenia, found to be hypothyroid.
Cardiology evaluated while the patient was in the MICU, said that the patient did not require pacer but to continue to monitor for drops in pressure or symptoms, which patient did not have during his hospital stay; thought likely to resolve as Synthroid takes effect.
Pancytopenia: patient was noted on admission to have WBC 1.9 down from baseline 6.0, Hct 26.2 down from baseline 30, plts 21 down from baseline 90-100.
EGD and cspy in [**5-21**] were negative for bleed, iron studies were c/w anemia of chronic disease with low retic count 1.7%.
They do not feel that a BM biopsy would change his management, but plan to follow him in clinic.
Of note, the patient's WBC count returned to the patient's normal range, his hct remained stable after receiving 2 units PRBCs.
His plt count remains low but is slowly trending upwards.
Blood sugars: pt has h/o DM2, was started on RISS as glyburide was held, then patient became hyponatremic, possibly because of hypothyroidism; was on a D5W drip briefly, RISS adjusted to keep sugars in check; pt seems very sensative to insulin at bedtime when he is not eating, so this scale was decreased compared to his daytime dosing.
Baseline Cr 3.5. .
CHF: patient was initially felt to be a bit overloaded [**2-19**] his CXR and his clinical presentation; this was thought to be due to a combination of bradycardia, anemia and possible infection; TTE showed LVH but no evid of worsening heart function with LVEF>55%.
