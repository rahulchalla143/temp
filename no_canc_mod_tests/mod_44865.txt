Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears depressed (?30%) but images are suboptimal for assessment of wall motion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-5-18**], left ventricular systolic function appears more vigorous in the setting of tachycardia.

His creatinine rose to 2.2.
His CT was removed, he was mobilized and over two days the ileus resolved, flatus passed and his diet was advanced from clears to regular heart healthy.
As he was hydrated, urine output picked up and his creatinine normalized to his baseline of 1.7.
