His troponin was 4.05 yesterday and peaked at 7.39 today.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) secondary to focal akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and severe hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Cardiac Perfusion Test ([**2164-3-1**]): IMPRESSION: No reversible myocardial perfusion defect.
Calculated LVEF = 19%.
Cardiac MR ([**2164-3-2**]): Impression: 1.
The LVEF and effective forward LVEF were severely depressed at 21% and 15%, respectively.

His work-up revealed NSTEMI with peak troponin at 7.39 trending down to 2.31 at time of admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
ECHO showed EF 15-20% with inf/posterior akinesis and severe hypokinesis of other regions.
Cardiac MR was also done (see results section) although it was a technically poor quality study.
Since pt very likely to be pushed over into needing dialysis with either cardiac cath or cardiac surgery, decision was made to medically manage and pt discharged to follow-up with [**Doctor Last Name 3782**] cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**].
His JVP was not significantly elevated, he had only trace pedal edema and bibasilar crackles.
An ACE-I was held as above due to renal failure and decision was made to postpone either cardiac surgery or cardiac cath due to thought that this would push pt over the edge to requiring dialysis and thought that in setting of very poor social stability that this would lead to a worse prognosis than medical management of his disease.
CXR raised question of consolidation.
# HTN: Patient's blood pressures were moderately elevated on admission, but now well controlled with SBPs in 120s.
Pt transitioned to very low dose of glipizide (2.5mg daily) when blood sugars ran high for a few days in the hospital.
Glucometer One glucometer  Please use to check your blood sugars at least 3 times each day.
Glucose Test Strips Please use glucose test strips with your glucometer to check your blood sugars at least three time each day.
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
Start Glipizide 2.5mg to control your blood sugar 4.
Start taking labetolol 150mg to decrease your heart rate and blood pressure 5.
