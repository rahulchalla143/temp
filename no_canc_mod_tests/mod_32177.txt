An outpt head MRI/MRA revealed total stenosis of the [**Doctor First Name 3098**] but no ischemic infarcts.
Since being on the neurology service, he has had a EEG negative for szs, rpt MRI/MRA head without ischemia or temporal lobe enhancement, and LP that was significant for lymphocytic pleocytosis (WBC 85, 95% lymphs).
CHEST: + accessory muscle use and abdominal breathing, improved from initial evaluation, + diffuse rhonchi ABD: Soft, NT, ND, no HSM EXT: No c/c/e SKIN: No rash   Pertinent Results: IMAGING:  [**2159-7-4**] Evoked Potentials: BRAIN STEM AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIAL (08-044): After stimulation of either ear there were very poorly formed (and likely unreliable) evoked potential peaks including wave I and probably waves III and V, but the latencies were extremely difficult to determine.
The study is unreliable but suggests some brain stem activity.
In the MICU, his major problems were AMS, respiratory failure, blood pressure lability, tremors.
His family brought up the possibility of an anti-NMDA receptor antibody mediated encephalitis as a possible cause, and CSF was sent to UPenn for special analysis; the Anti-NMDA Ab was negative.
He did not open his eyes, did not make purposeful movements, and did not withdraw to pain.
Work-up was significant for lymphocytosis on CSF, two stable MRIs, 2 EEGs that showed no seizure activity, and evoked potentials that showed some brainstem activity.
A full panel of encephalitis and prion disease labs were sent.
Labs were negative for Bartonella, Lyme, Erlichiosis, HSV as well as WNV, EEE, CJD.
Also, CSF was sent to UPenn for evaluation for anti-NMDA antibody encephalities and this was negative (testicular U/S performed for associated testicular malignancy in the setting of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was also negative and AFP which can be elevated in this setting was also negative).
With diuresis and broad spectum coverage, his CXR improved and his leukocytosis and fevers resolved.
Patient's sputum did grow out Klebsiella on [**7-6**] and he was initially treated with a course of vanc/cipro; cultures were pan-sensitive and vanc was D/C.
Because repeat sputum on [**7-10**] grew out GNR he was also started on cefipime, but the cultures only showed minimal growth of pan-sensitive Klebsiella and cefipime was D/C on [**7-13**].
After the decision was made to extubate on [**7-21**], his PEEP was weaned and he was kept sedated to a respiratory rate of [**10-17**].
<br> Blood pressure lability: Pt presented to the MICU with hypertensive urgency, which led to flash pulmonary edema.
As his mental status worsened, so did his hemodynamic instability.
Metoprolol was tried but this caused the patient to drop his SBPs and was not continued.
He was hyponatremic (130) on [**7-15**] but a repeat sodium was 140 and this was thought to be due to lab error.
Sodium was monitored and was within normal limits after this time.
<br> Leukocytosis: Increased WBC count initially; resolved.
CDiff negative X3.
