We obtained a cortisol stim test that was normal.
However, we did not feel that her hypotension was due to sepsis and we discontinued her antibiotics prior to floor transfer.
By discharge, 2 blood cultures and 1 urine culture were still negative.
Head CT and tox screen negative.
Neurosurgery consulted in ICU, however, once spinal/brain MRI were normal, they signed off.
