He was started on Ancef, but developed a diffuse erythroderma rash the day after initiation of Ancef therapy, which was felt to be due to a drug rash.
His blood pressure dropped to 70 systolic, and he was given IV fluids and started on peripheral dopamine.
On arrival to [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was no longer on the dopamine drip and was normotensive with blood pressure's in the 100's to 110's/60's to 70's.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ARRIVAL:  Temperature 98.6, heart rate 106, blood pressure 108/67, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 96 percent on 2 liters.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
2 plus dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
Strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 19.8 with 94 percent polys, 0 bands, 3 percent lymphs, hematocrit 35.3, platelets 201, INR 1.3, PTT 30.7, ESR 100, reticulocyte count 1.7, sodium 137, potassium 3.8, chloride 103, bicarbonate 21, BUN 12, creatinine 0.7, ALT 64, AST 27, LDH 81, CK 153, alkaline phosphatase 127, amylase 12, total bilirubin 1.7, direct bilirubin 1.0, lipase 12, troponin-T less than 0.01, albumin 3.3, uric acid 3.0, haptoglobin 328, TSH 0.36, Lyme serology 160:[**2167**], negative.
CHEST X-RAY:  Showed increased interstitial markings, possibly suggesting fluid overload.
Blood cultures were sent which did not reveal any    organism.
The Gram stain showed 2    plus polys but no organisms.
A repeat ultrasound at [**Hospital6 256**] showed only left groin enlarged lymph nodes.
An excisional biopsy was attempted; however, no lymph node was obtained.
After approximately 3 to 4 days, the patient's cellulitis was clinically improving, he was no longer spiking fevers, and his white blood cell count was decreasing.
Given his extremely low risk for MRSA, and the fact that his cultures did not reveal any organisms, the patient's antibiotic coverage was changed to PO clindamycin.
The patient never reported any pharyngitis, but given his complaints of diffuse arthralgias, myalgias, migrating neuropathic pain, there was some concern of rheumatic fever, as the patient had 2 ASO screens performed which were both negative.
Tularemia titers were sent to the State Lab    and were pending at the time of transfer out of the    intensive care unit.
An echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and    no pericardial effusion, and Lyme titers were initially    negative.
Therefore, the    decision was made to complete a 1 month course of    doxycycline, and to repeat Lyme serologies in [**2-6**] weeks.
