IMAGING: [**2179-1-29**] EKG #1: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
[**2179-1-29**] EKG #2: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Compared to tracing #1 ventricular rate is slower.

She was noted to be in afib with RVR, and CXR was concerning for pulmonary edema.
She was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of respiratory distress.
After Code Stroke called on arrival to ICU in setting of left hemiparesis (see below), and imaging revealed large R MCA infarct, decision was made to focus on comfort care only.
Code Stroke called, and CT Head/Neck revealed right MCA infarct.
Given the history of recent falls and her limited pre-stroke functionality, the decision was made not to give heparin or tPA.
