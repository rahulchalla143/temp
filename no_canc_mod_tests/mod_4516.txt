He underwent a noncontrast computed tomography which revealed a right groin fluid collection which was stable.
The hospital course was unremarkable except for a low hematocrit of 26.1 for which he was transfused.
The patient's hematocrit was 34.1.
A computed tomography was done there.
The patient was transferred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment.
History of chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of 2).
Complete blood count revealed white blood cell count was 10.3 (with neutrophils of 76 and lymphocytes of 16), and his hematocrit was 26.5.
The patient was afebrile with a temperature maximum of 98.2.
The patient's electrolytes showed a potassium of 6.2 with a creatinine of 4.6 (which was elevated from his baseline of 2).
Cultures were obtained at that time.
The patient was then transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit for controlled monitoring and care.
His blood gas was 7.30/31/191/16/-9.
The patient's postoperative hematocrit was 28.
His white blood cell count was 7.
His blood urea nitrogen was 94.
His creatinine was 3.6.
Recommendations were to continue to monitor his urine output, maintain his systolic blood pressure at greater than 110, maintain his hematocrit at greater than 30, hold ACE inhibitors, and to avoid Lasix and diuretics and nonsteroidal medications.
Recommendations were since his urine output was good, there would be supportive care and dose medications for a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 50.
The patient remained intubated and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for continued monitoring and care.
The patient initial wound cultures grew gram-positive cocci.
The foot wound culture grew gram-positive cocci, gram-positive rods, and gram-negative rods.
The patient was seen by the Cardiology Service and a transesophageal echocardiogram was done.
His ejection fraction was calculated at greater than 50%.
Their recommendations were to continue vancomycin and to dose when levels were less than 15.
Repeat blood cultures times two sets to rule out bacteremia.
The patient was extubated on postoperative day one, and the patient was transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit for continued monitoring and care.
His hematocrit was 31 with a total white blood cell count of 6.6.
His blood urea nitrogen was 67.
His creatinine was 3.1.
Liver function tests were unremarkable.
The patient's blood cultures were no growth but not finalized at the time of this dictation.
The initial wound culture grew oxacillin-resistant coagulase-positive Staphylococcus.
A repeat wound culture grew the same organisms.
The patient underwent pulmonary vascular resistance studies which demonstrated noncompressible vessels with mild left tibial arterial disease.
The dopplerable signals at popliteal, posterior tibialis, and dorsalis pedis were all triphasic.
The pulse volume metatarsal was 26 on the right and 14 on the left.
Ankle-brachial index could not be calculated secondary to elevated noncompressible vessels.
