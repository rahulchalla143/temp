A lumbar puncture was performed with protein and glucose not consistent with a meningitis.
Gram stain and culture did not grow any thing out.
CSF was negative for RPR and cryptococcal antigen.
CMV PCR, toxoplasmosis PCR, and EBV PCR are still pending at the time of this discharge summary.
Given that pt has a CD4 count > 200 (298 in [**11-29**]) this was thought to unlikely due to toxoplasmosis, though pt does have a history of it.
MRI was not done as there was no clear indication for it given the negative workup.
