An LP was not done last night due to low concern and the feeling that this is hepatic encephalopathy.
He denies any benzodiazepine use, and serum tox was negative.
Sounds like hematemesis was post-epistaxis, wich was likely from his coagulopathy (elevated INR plus low platelets from liver dysfunction).
--hold diuretics for now given dry state on exam --monitor for further hemoptysis  4) Anemia:  Pt's baseline is mid-30s.
