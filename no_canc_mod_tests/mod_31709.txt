[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The mean pressure gradient across the valve is 4 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 3.5 L/min.
Left ventricular systolic function post-MVR is mildly depressed (LVEF 45%).
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
Baseline cr 1.4 with peak increase post operatively 1.6, medications adjusted.
