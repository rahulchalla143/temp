She was found to have an bilirubinemia of 12.5, mild transaminitis and abdominal imaging showing 1.6-cm dilatation of her common bile duct with RUQ showing intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with a hypoechoic focus at the level of pancreatic head.
Subsequent ERCP ([**2142-2-20**]) was performed showing 1-cm gallstone at the lower CBD.
Her hemoglobin was reportedly 7.2 g/dL at the OSH and she was given 2L NS prior to transfer (her hemoglobin and hematocrit on discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] was 10.6 g/dL and 34.5%).
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], initial VS 98.9 96 101/51 18 98%RA.
Exam revealed one more episode of frank hematochezia with clot that filled the bedpan in the ED.
Laboratory data revealed WBC 10.0, hemoglobin 6.2%, HCT 18.3%, platelets 219.
Creatinine 0.6.
INR 2.0 (from 1.2 on [**2-19**]).
The patient was evaluated by ERCP and there was plan for repeat ERCP the date of admission.
Reflux esophagitis, GERD 4.
RESP: Clear to auscultation bilaterally without adventitious sounds.
Digital exam reveals normal tone.
A 5cm by 10mm double pig tail biliary stent was placed successfully  (hemostasis, hemostasis, stent placement) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Transfuse pRBC and FFP as needed Q8hr hct checks NPO overnight until hct stabilizes and no evidence of active bleeding is noted.

# BRIGHT RED BLOOD PER RECTUM, FALLING HEMATOCRIT - Patient presented with rectal bleeding with hematochezia in the setting of recent ERCP that involved biliary stenting and sphincterotomy.
Also presented with INR of 2.0 without anticoagulation, antiplatelet or strong NSAID history.
Hemoglobin 6.2 g/dL, hematocrit 18.3% (recent values 10.6 g/dL, 34.5%).
Repeat ERCP visualized her retained stone and will need to be repeated in 1-month for further intervention.
She underwent CTA Pancreas, which showed 14 mm hypodense lesion in the superior head of the pancreas with concern for involvement of a short portion of the inferior wall of the main portal vein.
These results were discussed with ERCP team, and patient will return in approximately 1 week for EUS with FNA biopsy of the mass for further evaluation.
# INAPPROPRIATELY ELEVATED INR - Pt was noted to have INR 2 at time of admission, likely due to decreased PO intake with recent weight loss.
INR normalized after 2 units of FFP and vitamin K 4 mg PO.
Her blood pressure medications were resumed once her hematocrit stabilized.
# REFLUX ESOPHAGITIS, GERD - Remote history without active symptoms.
Limited evaluation of the esophagus and stomach on ERCP ([**2142-2-21**]) was normal.
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: [ ] outpatient EUS/FNA of pancreatic mass; in approx 1 week [ ] Repeat ERCP in 1 month for biliary stent removal [ ] Follow up LFT's and Coags at outpatient follow up, to ensure stability [ ] Follow up nutritional status and monitor for further weight loss  Medications on Admission: 1.
The bleeding stopped, and your blood levels have stabilized.
During this hospitalization, imaging showed a mass in your pancreas.
You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by the Gastroenterology Department to schedule an appointment in approximately 1 week for an endoscopic ultrasound and biopsy of this area.
