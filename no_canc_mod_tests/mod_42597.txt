Her electrolytes continued to improve, and her bicarb gradually returned to [**Location 213**].
Creatinine was 1.7 on admission (baseline is 0.8).
Her gastroparesis improved and she was able to tolerate a regular diabetic diet without difficulty.
A repeat head CT was performed, as well as extensive MRI imaging of the head/neck (MRI, MRA, MRV, see results).
However, imaging and further evaluation by the Neurology attending was not consistent with a CNS event.
Note that at the time of initial identification of the neurologic complaints, her calcium level was noted to be low, however this corrected to 8.3 once an albumin level was obtained, and thus not likely to contribute to her symptoms.
Pending labs: Blood cx [**5-16**] still pending at discharge.
Podiatry for ulcer evaluation on [**5-31**].
