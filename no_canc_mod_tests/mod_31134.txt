[**2166-4-7**] CT C-spine: 1.
[**2166-4-7**] CT head: 1.
Comminuted nasal bone fracture with blood products and fluid within the left maxillary and ethmoid sinuses, described in more detail on concurrent sinus CT.  [**2166-4-7**] CT max/sinus/maxillofacial: Study limited by osteopenia.
If there is continued clinical concern for acute fracture, consider correlation with CT or MRI.
Chondrocalcinosis of the pubic symphysis and femoroacetabular joints.
Right subdural hematoma layering along the right cerebral hemisphere is increased in size compared to the most recent prior CT examination with increased mass effect on the adjacent sulci and a slight increase in leftward shift of normally midline structures (now a 4-mm leftward shift, previously 2 mm leftward shift).
[**2166-4-9**] Repeat Head CT: 1.
Stable mixed density right subdural hematoma along the right cerebral hemisphere layering on the right tentorium with associated 4-mm leftward shift of the midline, unchanged from the most recent prior CT examination.

She was administered two units of PRBC and her hct bumped apropriately from 23 to 29.8.
Though her follow up head CT showed an increase in size of her SDH her neurological exam remained nonfocal and no intervention was required.
A repeat CT was performed again the following day which showed no changes (please see pertinent results section for details).
Her vital signs were routinely monitored and she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
A foley catheter was placed on admission for urine output monitoring and removed on [**4-10**].
Her home valsartan and lasix were held on admission given her elevated creatinine and blood loss.
On [**4-11**] her creatinine continued the trend downward toward normal and her hematocrit remained stable so these medications were restarted.
Repeat hematocrit showed adequate increase to 28.
