At that time, she was taken to cardiac catheterization and had stented the RCA.
The patient went to outside hospital, [**Hospital1 **] for shortness of breath and presented with a blood pressure of 167/87, sating at 97% on 4 liters.
Her electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed normal sinus rhythm with a normal axis, normal intervals, with flattening of the T waves with leads III, and aVL, otherwise unremarkable, and CK of 67, and troponin-I of 0.15.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
Her cardiac catheterization was delayed secondary to an elevated creatinine levels at 1.9.
Cardiac catheterization status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2135-3-1**].
Cardiac catheterization showed a 90% stenosis of the RCA, mild disease of the LAD, no disease of the left circumflex.
Ejection fraction of 51% and stenting of the right coronary artery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pulse is 77, blood pressure 176/87, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 98% on 4 liters.
Lung examination:  The patient has crackles on both bases of lung fields.
LABORATORIES FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White count of 14.8, hematocrit at 33.8, creatinine 1.9, CK of 67, troponin-I of 0.15, INR of 0.98.
Last cardiac catheterization in [**2135-3-31**] showed an ejection fraction of nearly 51%.
Patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction for peak troponins of 0.77.
Patient received an echocardiogram, which showed inferior hypokinesis and anterior akinesis.
Echocardiogram also showed a decreased ejection fraction of 30-35%.
Patient was subsequently taken to cardiac catheterization, which confirmed an ejection fraction of 35%.
Cardiac catheterization showed a right dominant system.
Patient's blood pressure was monitored and blood pressure medications were titrated up as her blood pressure was uncontrolled.
Postprocedure, the patient's hematocrit dropped from 33.8 to 29.4.
Patient's oxygen saturation dropped to the low 90s on 2 liters of oxygen.
Patient also became tachypneic with a respiratory rate into the 40s.
Chest x-ray was performed, which showed lung examination consistent with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema.
The patient's hematocrit was now stabilized to the mid 30s.
Patient's creatinine levels continued to be elevated at 1.9.
Patient was stabilized on the Cardiac Care Unit, and transferred back to the cardiac floor, at which point her oxygen saturations were in the mid 90s on room air.
Creatinine continued to be elevated into 2.2, at which point patient's ACE inhibitor was discontinued and creatinine levels were monitored.
The highest elevation of her creatinine was 2.8.
Urine cultures were sent and urinalysis suggested a urinary tract infection.
Patient was discharged home with a hematocrit of 30.1 and creatinine of 2.1.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient was discharged home with home VNA services to draw blood work to maintain therapeutic INR.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%.
Anemia with a hematocrit into the low 30s.
