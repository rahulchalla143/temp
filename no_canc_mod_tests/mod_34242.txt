Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
COMPARISON: With examination of [**2187-5-25**].
Cardiac enlargement, which could represent cardiomyopathy or underlying pericardial effusion.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Emergent neurosurgery evaluation recommended      Final Report EXAM: CT of the head.
TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the head were obtained without contrast.
Following this using departmental protocol CT angiography of the head was acquired.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD:  CT angiography demonstrates elevation of the right middle cerebral artery secondary to mass effect from the hematoma.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK:  CT angiography of the neck demonstrates normal appearances of the carotid and vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Gross: Multiple fragments of soft white brain tissue and blood clot measuring 7 x 5.5 x 2.5 cm in aggregate.
She was loaded with Dilantin and her BP was kept less than 140.
A neurology consult was completed to identify reason for bleed,they recommended a CTA head and neck showed No evidence of abnormal vascular structures or aneurysm on the CTA of the head.
An echo was done that showed echo reveals EF 50%, 3+ TR.
Her INR is pending at this pt and in speaking to the receiving physiatrist at [**Hospital1 **] - the pts INR will be called to 2 South where the pt will be admitted and they will dose her for this evening.
The INR recommended by the neurology team is 2.5-3.5.
Her INR yesterday was 1.3 prior to her first dose of coumadin.
