Thrombosis of the proximal superior mesenteric artery with distal reconstitution probably through collateral flow.
Wedge compression deformities of L1 and L3 are probably chronic.
Please note that MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**]-weighted imaging is more sensitive for evaluation of acute infarction if this is a significant clinical concern.
Brief Hospital Course: a/p:  89 yo female with afib, CVA x2, dementia, now with SMA clot, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**], non-enhancing kidney on CT and anuria with unresponsiveness.
# abdominal pain/hypotension - pt admitted to the surgical service, and found to have thrombus in left renal artery (with complete left renal infarction), and superior mesenteric artery.
serial lactates were trending down, and pt was without peritonitis.
Admission CT HEAD showed no acute bleeding, but could not exclude embolic event.
She has known clot in SMA, left renal artery and LEFT atrial thrombus (seen on CT superior cuts of CT abd/pelvis) despite anticoagulation with coumadin.
She was continued on empiric antibiotics for concern for PNA, though CXR was unremarkable.
After extensive discussion with both pt's HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12149**] and her son [**Name (NI) 12150**] [**Name2 (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12151**], decision was made to change goals of care to comfort measures only, as it was felt that she had likely suffered a recurrent stroke in spite of heparin anticoagulation.
Her urine output declined quickly.
Over the course of [**2104-2-25**] her urine output continue to decline to neglible levels.
