to reduce his sinus tachycardia and bring his blood pressure down.
His exam was unremarkable, but he had slightly decreased urine output which responded to an increase in Lasix, and he was encouraged to continue ambulating.
His creatinine was stable at 0.7, his hematocrit was stable at 32.0, and his white count was normal.

The patient continued to ambulate with a plan for discharge the following day if he remained afebrile and had improved blood pressure.
Follow- up cultures did not have any growth at that point.
On postoperative day 11, an echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection fraction of 55%, a dilated aortic root, and good wall function.
