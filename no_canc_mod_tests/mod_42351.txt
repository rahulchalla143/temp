PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, temperature 97.7, heart rate 98, respirations 13, 94% on room air saturations, blood pressure 141/71.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Extraocular movements intact, pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Diagnostic studies reveal electrocardiogram interpretation, sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block.
Echocardiogram:  [**2183-1-8**], preliminary echocardiogram showed no minimal pericardial effusion, no evidence of tamponade.
Repeat echocardiogram, [**2183-1-10**], no occlusions, limited study, no carotid doppler study performed.
Left ventricular wall thickness was normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Previous study is not available for review.
Cardiac catheterization [**2183-1-8**]:  1.
Left ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of 46% with mild global hypokinesis.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The right-sided filling pressures were normal.
The preliminary capillary wedge pressure was 12 mm of mercury.
The left ventricular end diastolic pressure was elevated about 30 mm of mercury.
Cardiac index depressed at 2.2 liters/min meter squared.
Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction; 3.
Hemodynamics:  Right atrium 12/9/9, right ventricle 28/10, pulmonary artery 28/16/21, pulmonary capillary wedge 15/13/12, left ventricle 163/30, aorta 163/78, cardiac output 4.4, cardiac index 2.2, SVR 1836, PVR 164.
ETT date, [**2182-9-23**], affixed anteroseptal defect, inferior/inferior septal staining with reperfusion, ejection fraction of 34%.
Laboratory data on [**2183-1-4**], sodium 141, potassium 4.3, chloride 102, bicarbonate 26, BUN 21, creatinine 0.8, INR 0.9, white blood count 9.3, hematocrit of 36.8, decreased down to 33 and platelets 276.
Peak CKMB 10.
The patient was placed on Telemetry and serial hematocrits were monitored q.
The patient's hematocrit dropped from 33 to 31.7 at which point the patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells with an inappropriate bump and the patient's hematocrit of 30.7.
The patient's hematocrit subsequently remained stable and increased to a predischarge hematocrit of 36.7.
TTE worse than at bedside and repeated several days after to evaluate for cardiac tamponade.
The patient's TTE showed an ejection fraction of 35% to 40%.
Depression - The patient will be restarted on an outpatient medication regimen on the day of discharge.
