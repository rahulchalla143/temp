On initial presentation to the Emergency Department, his temperature was 100.3, pulse 131, blood pressure 130/70, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 97% in room air.
Laboratories revealed a large anion gap and thus was pursued finding a lactate of 13.
The patient remained tachycardic with blood pressure 110 to 130.
Additional Emergency Department evaluation and treatment included magnesium repletion five grams intravenously, 40 meq potassium, Valium 10 and 5 mg, Ativan 2 mg, blood pressure and heart rate remained as above.
Repeat hematocrit went down nine points.
Because of concern for bowel injury, CT was performed, and the patient was seen by trauma surgery.
He was planned for a paracentesis, but rechecked platelets showed that they were down at 23,000.
DIC laboratories were sent and they elected to defer the paracentesis and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.

INR 2.2.
Chem7 revealed sodium 140, potassium 3.2, chloride 93, bicarbonate 15, blood urea nitrogen 12, creatinine 0.9.
Calcium 9.1, magnesium 1.1, phosphate 2.9.
Repeat hematocrit at 11:43 was 39.5.
Amylase 25.
Serum toxicology negative except for ethanol at 96.
Urine toxicology negative.
Arterial blood gases revealed pH 7.44, pCO2 25, pO2 75, lactate 13.5.
Potassium 3.3, free calcium 1.03.
CT abdomen at 5:00 a.m. revealed no trauma.
CT scan at 1:40 was negative without a right mass.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.
Vital signs revealed temperature 100.3, heart rate 144, systolic blood pressure 127, respiratory rate 40.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - Icteric sclera.
The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally except slightly decreased breath sounds at the right base.
Liver function tests provide evidence for hepatocellular damage.
myocardial infarction, coagulopathy, ascites with SBP and bilateral pleural effusions.
He was coagulopathic with INR 2.1.
He had a troponin of 3.3 and has bilateral pleural effusions likely secondary to ascites and thrombocytopenic due to splenomegaly.
The patient spiked a low grade fever to 100.6 with an increased white blood cell count to 18.5 and 23.0.
He had ascites tapped on [**2156-6-30**], with 2300 white blood cells and he was treated for peritonitis with two grams Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.
Then on [**2156-7-11**], the patient developed severe right lower quadrant pain and an ultrasound was done which showed a hernia which was obstructed.
These cultures were negative.
Blood cultures from the fever spike showed no growth to date.
Urine culture from that day are negative.
