He was noted to be febrile and hypotension to systolic blood pressure in the 90s, with baseline blood pressure in the low 100s.
His sputum was positive for Pseudomonas.
Upper endoscopy was done by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7640**], showing a polyp in the stomach, and otherwise normal.
An abdominal CT scan was done, showing gallstones and small ascites.
The patient was sent back to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.
Left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, four plus mitral regurgitation and three plus tricuspid regurgitation.
PTH is low, 25 hydroxy Vitamin D levels are low and PTH RP levels are negative.
A bone scan was done showing increased uptake in the left shoulder, where on x-ray the patient was noted to have a calcified appearing mass.
Subsequent CT scan guided biopsy of this calcified mass in the left shoulder revealed evidence of heterotopic calcification.
LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 10.3, hematocrit 30.6.
Platelets 340.
PT 12.8, PTT 32.3, INR 1.1.
Sodium 130, potassium 4.5, chloride 106, bicarbonate 16; BUN 17, creatinine 0.6, glucose 84.
ALT 30, AST 34, alkaline phosphatase 675, amylase 108, total bilirubin 0.4, lipase 104.
Calcium 8.6, phosphate 3.3, magnesium 2.5, albumin 2.6.
An abdominal x-ray with contrast injected into the J-tube to assess for feeding tube patency was done, which showed satisfactory positioning of the tube.
The patient was to have an upper endoscopy done to evaluate for gastric outlet obstruction; however, the patient's sister informed the Medical Team that an upper endoscopy had recently been done about two weeks prior at [**Hospital6 3873**].
Both the G and J tube passed the gastric outlet and were patent, and were not kinked.
At this time, all the appropriate work-up for this patient's recurrent nausea and vomiting have been pursued and no further work-up is needed.
PULMONARY:  Recurrent aspiration - the patient was placed on aspiration precautions.
Repeat sputum culture done on [**2159-4-10**], revealed two different colonies of Pseudomonas as well as Enterobacter species.
At night, the patient is rested on AC-ventilation with total volume 400, respiratory rate of 20, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 40%.
Amylase and lipase levels were trended on the first few hospital days during this admission and were noted to have decreased from his prior hospital say.
Work-up revealed low normal PTH, low vitamin D levels with PTH RP negative.
A osteocalcin level was normal and bone specific alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated, possibly suggestive of Paget's Disease.
A biopsy of a soft tissue mass in the left glenohumeral joint was done, which was suspect for malignancy.
During a recent admission the patient was treated with two doses of intravenous pamidronate, once with 30 mg and the second time with 50 mg, and the patient was given Calcitriol to replete his vitamin D stores, as these were noted to be low.
During the patient's current hospital stay, calcium on admission as normal (9.1 corrected to 10.6 with an albumin of 1.9).
Vitamin D levels checked on [**3-24**] were noted to be low (less than 7.0), so the patient was redosed with high dose Vitamin D, 10,000 Units, and was to then continue taking Calcitriol 0.125 micrograms per J-tube q. day.
