Initial EKG with T wave inversions.
On arrival pt went to cardiac cath where he was found to have 3VD with RCA and LCx occlusions.
Unable to cross RCA lesions, LCx lesions stented x2 BMS.

[**2142-7-2**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM: EF 40%.
Initially he was thought to have an RCA lesion, however stenting of the LCx revealed collaterals to the RCA suggesting subacute occlusion.
Patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient, and will have a stress test done at that time to determine whether CABG is indicated.
#) Pump:  TTE revealed an EF of 40% with mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis to akinesis.
The patient had mild inspiratory crackles on exam (first noted on [**6-30**] and CXR on [**7-2**] revealed congestive heart failure.
#) R retroperitoneal bleed: Pt noted to have a hct drop on [**7-2**] (was 40 on admission, dropped to 26.8 by [**7-2**]).
CT abd/pelvis on [**7-2**] revealed a large retroperitoneal hematoma, likely secondary to his catheterization.
Hematocrit has been stable since receiving the transfusion, on discharge = 32.7. .
