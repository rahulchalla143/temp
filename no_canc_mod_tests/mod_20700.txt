Admission Date: [**2154-9-1**]        Discharge Date: [**2154-9-5**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex: F  Service: NSURG   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old woman found on the floor at homoe who was minimally responsive and brought to an outside hospital where her head CT showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with right inferior temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] hemorrhage.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for angiogram and possible coiling.
Vital signs on admission was temperature 99.5, blood pressure 142/74, heart rate 78, Respiratory rate 21, sats 98 percent.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 27, hematocrit 46.8, platelets 301, sodium 142, K 3.2, chloride 107, CO2 23, Bun 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 149.
She was sent to angiogram on [**2154-9-1**] which showed a ruptured right posterior communicating artery aneurysm which she had coiling without complications.
Neurological exam remained difficult to assess at times because of agitation from the ET tube with resultant increased ICP and decreased pCO2.
Urine was no growth to date and CSF was no growth.
Head CT was done emergently which was negative for any change.
A head CT post- op demonstrated ischemic watershed infarcts consistent with severe diffuse vasospasm.
A angiogram was then performed to determine the source of the infarcts and to rule out emboli from the coil mass.
The angiogram disclosed severe vasospasm with thread- like vascular caliber.
