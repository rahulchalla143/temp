Trop at OSH was 0.07 (indeterminate) and had increased O2 requirement.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization which revealed nonobstructive CAD.
He met all inclusion criteria, and did not meet any exclusion criteria, was screened and accepted to be randomized to either [**Hospital1 10723**]/TAVI or surgical AVR as per study protocol.
He was admitted for cardiac enzyme monitoring, out of concern abd pain could be cardiac in etiology.
Troponins were trended and were 0.074, then 0.102, then 0.121.

ECHO [**2112-2-23**] Pre implant  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
ECHO [**2112-2-25**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-12-23**], a [**Year (4 digits) **] prosthesis is present and is functioning normally with no evidence of aortic regurgitation.
ECHO [**2112-2-29**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-2-25**], very mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation is now seen and the estimated PA systolic pressure is now lower.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and post-procedure echo showed resolution of aortic stenosis with a well-seated valve, with an EF of 55%.
Most recent cath at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**11/2111**]) revealed no obstructive CAD.
Given his several hospitalizations for epistaxis we discussed the risk benefit of anticoagulation with his hematologist/oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**], who agreed with us that given his CHADS2 score of 4 with an annual stroke rate of 8% and no major bleeds, anticoaggulation would still be indicated, and the patient agreed with this plan.
C diff toxin was negative.
He received 1 unit of PRBCs for a HCT of 25.5, and discharge HCT was 28.
#.CKD: baseline creatinine 1.2, stable throughout last hospitalization.
Creatinine remained stable at 0.8 upon discharge.
Blood sugars remained in the 100s throughout his hospital stay.
Transfused 2u PRBC [**2-19**] at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**].
Your workup and cultures here were negative, you remained fever free, and the symptoms resolved on their own.
3. your coumadin dose may need to be adjusted daily until a therapeutic INR of 2.0 is reached as treatment for your underlying atrial fibrillation.
