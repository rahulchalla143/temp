He presented to his PCP today who found lower abdominal pain and referred him to the ED, where he was found to have EKG changes.
His recent GI workup is for a h/o low Hct on prior admissions (to 34) and guaiac positive stools.
Per patient, colonoscopy ([**Hospital1 112**]), abdominal MRI and capsule endoscopy have all been unremarkable.
His PCP noted [**Name9 (PRE) 25714**] abdominal pain on deep palpation, which the patient says was reproduced in the ED.
Initial vitals showed hypertension to SBP 190.
EKG changes were concerning for STE in the inferior leads, over a territory of a known old infarct.
CXR in the ED was negative for PNA.
He was discharged, then came back 1 day later with recurrent symptoms, stable cardiac enzymes (peak toponin 0.04), and was taken for a repeat cath on [**3-21**].
The cath showed patent stents and an 80% OM2 lesion to which a new DES was successfully placed.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 4 cm at 20 degrees.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
IMPRESSION: Mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function with an EF of 40% and regional dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral hypokinesis consistent with CAD.
Given no CP and low enzymes, not ACS or cardiac strain in the setting of hypovolemia and likely tachycardia from diarrhea and nausea, c/w lightheadedness.
EKG was unchanged in AM.
Cardiac enzymes were unchanged.
Echo today showed mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function with an EF of 40% and regional dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral hypokinesis consistent with CAD.
No evidence of vegitations on TTE given recent dental work.
Recent endoscopy and colonoscopy were negative for sources of bleeding or diverticula (per patient).
Additionally, the patient will follow-up with his GI (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10794**] for further outpatient management.
On Admission his Cr was 1.4.
Additionally, your abdominal pain improved and a x-ray of your abdomen showed constipation.
