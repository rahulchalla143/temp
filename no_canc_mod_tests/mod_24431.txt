ECG Study Date of [**2124-7-8**]  11:22:58 AM Sinus tachycardia.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o F with a history of COPD on home oxygen (3LNC) and chronic prednisone, who initially presented to the hospital with dyspnea and two days of chest pain along with a cough productive of green sputum, diagnosed and treated for COPD exacerbation.
On admission she was diagnosed with a COPD exacerbation, thought to be due to heat exposure as this has happened in the past and there was no evidence of pneumonia on her chest x-ray.
Her hypoxia improved and she is currently on her home oxygen with sats in the low to mid 90's.
There was discussion about keeping her in the ICU overnight for bipap titration, however as it was thought that she likely had a complex sleep apnea, so will need a full sleep study with titration prior to bipap initiation.
Inactive Issues # Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: See above for MICU details, she was diuresed with good effect in the ICU, appears euvolemic on exam at discharge.
# OSA: Likely contributing to hypercarbia in addition to her COPD, no bipap for now but will make sure outpatient sleep study is arranged on discharge  # Fibromyalgia: she was continued on home morphine, oxycodone, carisoprodol, gabapentin, ibuprofen.
TRANSITIONAL CARE: - Will need evaluation for BiPAP as an outpatient due to worsening hypercapnea and OSA.
