Admission Date: [**2153-8-27**]        Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:  [**2153-8-27**]        Sex:  F  Service:  Neonatology   ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Infant was born at 32 and 1/7 weeks to a 39-year-old G3/P1 (to 3) mother with prenatal screens significant for blood type A positive, antibody negative, hep B surface antigen negative, HIV negative, CF negative woman.
Apgar's were 8 and 9 at one and five minutes of age, respectively.
INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight of 1660 grams (which is the 50th percentile), length of 43 cm.
The exam was remarkable for a well-appearing preterm infant in no distress with initial vital signs with a temperature of 97.4, heart rate of 145, respiratory rate of 44.
On day of life #24, due to     persistence of the soft systolic murmur a chest x-ray was     obtained--the cardiac silhouette was noted to be     normal.
EKG performed at that time was also read as normal.
Four     extremity blood pressures were normal.
If the quality of     the murmur increases in intensity, further evaluation is     warranted.
Most recent hematocrit was on day of life     #23, which was 27.6 with a reticulocyte count of 2.4.
State screening on [**8-30**], which was day of life #3, returned with a pattern of FS.
Repeat screening was sent and returned on day of life #16, also with an FS pattern consistent with sickle cell disease.

Prematurity at 32 and 1/7 weeks.
