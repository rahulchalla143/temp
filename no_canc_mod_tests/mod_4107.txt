TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.
Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-5-19**], the findings are similar.
[**MD Number(1) 21890**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute renal failure, status post renal transplant.
Ultrasound-guided puncture of the right common femoral     artery.
Pelvic angiogram and arteriogram of the transplant renal     artery.
Using ultrasound the right common femoral artery was identified.
A pelvic angiogram and transplant renal arteriogram were performed.
Using a Glidewire and an Omni flush catheter, we selected the renal artery.
In the ED he had EKG done and cardiac enzymes started.
His EKG showed no difference to prior EKGs and only Troponin T was mildly elevated at 0.05.
#Chest pain: Cardiac problems are less likely because his cardiac enzymes were negative and his second EKG showed no changes.
He underwent stress testing, which was notable for marked reduction in ability to exercise due to SOB but he had normal cardiac perfusion and an echo demonstrating LVEF of 60%.
In summary his cardiac workup showed it to be non-contributory to this process.
and second EKG ruled out MI and NSTEMI.
His CP symptoms and history of GERD and Baretts makes relfux the likley cause of his pain, which brought him to the ED.
His FENA on admission was <1% which is suggestive of prerenal azotemia.
Labs showed proetinuria of 30, but his baseline is up near 300.
Renal service followed his admission closely and was advising on BP meds, fluids, and imaging of renal artery.
Angiogram revealed patency of the renal artery, despite this the vessel was angioplastied.
He also commented on abdominal distension and so CT scan was ordered to assess for ascites, which would also be a mechanism for pressure on the diaphragm.
He had an ABG whihc showed chronic respiratory acidosis.
His HTN was under better control on the new regimen.
#TIIDM: His blood sugars fluctuated each day throughout his stay.
#CHF: His last echo showed compensated diastolic heart failure and the echo during this hospitalization showed LVEF of 60% demonstrating adequate compensation.
In light of these results and phsyical exam his CHF was thought to not be contributing to his chest pain.
Medications on Admission: Minoxidil 10mg 1TAB 2xday Prednisone 5mg 1TAB daily Clonidine  0.1mg 1TAB 2x daily Calcitriol 0.25mcg 1capdaily Furosemide 3TAB 2xday Mycophenolate 500mg 1TAB 2xday Lisinopril 10mg 1TAB QHS Labetalol 200mg 3TAB 2xday ASA 81 mg Humalin NPH 20 units AM and 15 in PM   Discharge Medications: 1.

You also had labwork and tests done to make sure that your chest pain was not caused by your heart.
You underwent a test to check the blood supply to your kidney which did not show a reason for your renal failure.
Please discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5717**] about possibly getting another sleep study to titrate your CPAP.
Please check your blood sugar at least daily.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5717**] or the [**Last Name (un) **] Center with any blood sugars greater than 300 or less than 75.
If your blood sugar is less than 75 or you feel symptoms of low blood sugar such as shakiness, lightheadedness, confusion, or nausea, please eat something and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5717**], the [**Last Name (un) **] Center, or come to the emergency department.
