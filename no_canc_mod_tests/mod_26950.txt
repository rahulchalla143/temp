SINGLE VIEW CHEST, AP: There has been interval placement of a right IJ CVL with the tip within the mid SVC.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color ultrasound of the abdomen was performed without priors available for comparison.
The splenic vein is prominent at the level of the spleno-portal confluence, which can be an early indicator of portal hypertension.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
COMPARISON STUDY: CT scan, [**2172-5-11**], which demonstrated a very large right inguinal scrotal hernia containing both right colon and cecum as well as multiple small bowel loops.
Color flow and Doppler assessment of the testes and epididymides show normal to perhaps slightly increased vascularity in both testes in a symmetrical distribution with normal pulsed Doppler waveforms.
However, since no contrast is available for use in ultrasound, the assessment for bowel wall ischemia is incomplete on this study and consideration of contrast-enhanced CT scan is recommended.
Since prior tracing of [**2172-6-28**] voltage in leads V1-V3 is decreased on the current study and the rate has increased.
