Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
LV systolic function is preserved post bypass.
He was then transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
V wires removed without incident, but one atrial wire could not be removed and was clipped at the skin.
