Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent), mainly due to abnormal left ventricular electrical/mechanical activation sequence.

Blood cultures remained persistently sterile.
[**Last Name (un) **] stim showed preservation of adrenal function with baseline at 21.9 and a rise to 38 after 1 hour after cosyntropin.
Continued to be hypotensive during CVVH only, but later was able to maintain his BP during HD sessions as time went on.
Over the latter part of his hospital course, he has maintained systolic blood pressures greater than 90.
POSSIBLE ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS: noted on CT abd/pelvis.
IR study showed good drainage contrast into duodenum, so drain was clamped and LFT's/AlkP were followed with the surgery team.
After the labs remained stable, this drain was pulled.
RECURRENT PNA: he initially noted increased sputum, fever, and some infiltrates on CXR (CHF vs infiltrate) c/w PNA.
Sputum Cx grew back MRSA and enterobacter, changed to CTX after sensitivity panel.
His CXR showed no evidence of a new pulmonary infiltrate.
His WBC count rose slightly.
Sputum grew MRSA and he was started on a 10 day course of vancomycin for MRSA tracheobronchitis.
His vanc levels were dosed at 1g to keep levels >25 for good pulmonary penetration.
Digoxin was held for serum level 2.2 and evidence of dig toxicity on EKG (accelerated junctional rhythm).
Repeat EF showed EF of 30%.
This will need to be readdressed over time as he will benefit from an ACEI from a CHF and blood pressure standpoint.
Subsequent rate control will be through beta-blockade, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].
Despite this reversal, his INR continued to be elevated for unclear reasons.
He did have repeat swallow study which continued to demonstrate high risk for aspiration.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Hydralazine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours): hold for sbp less than 90 and during HD days.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): please hold on HD days and for sbp less than 85 and hr less than 60.

A repeat swallow eval could be performed in [**12-28**] weeks to determine if improved.

He should have labs (chem 7 w/ calcium, mag, phos and digoxin) checked atleast every other day (with HD).
