Upon admission, she then became hypotensive to systolic of 70s, so her dilt gtt was d/c'ed and she was bolused with saline.
She was subsequently found to have GNRs in her blood and urine cultures, as well as group B strep in urine.
Her course was complicated by demand ischemia with Trop I peak of 0.85 and ARF with creatinine peak of 2.08. .
INR went from 2.1 to 6.5 on [**1-25**], which is now down to 1.35 after vitamin K. She had a RUQ ultrasound that showed gallbladder and CBD sludge v. stone v. mass and associated intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree dilatation.
Pt was transferred here for GI evaluation and possible ERCP given complicated anatomy.
CHF 2.
Clear to auscultation bilatearlly.

Pt had an ERCP on [**2189-1-27**] to work-up the common bile duct obstruction seen on the RUQ ultrasound from the OSH.
A 7cm by 7FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully to establish effective biliary drainage, which later become dislodaged and was removed.
Blood cultures from [**2189-1-29**] later grew VRE, and she was switched from vanc to linezolid.
Her PO intake increased and her albumin has beeen improving.
She underwent an ultrasound of her right arm which was negative for DVT (she remained anticoagulated on heparin SC during her hospitalization) .
She presented with a hematocrit of 30.1 which trended down to 23.0.
Her labs did not show any hemolysis.
Her anemia was likely related to iron deficiency and bone marrow suppression in the face of multiple medical issues.
She was later switched to linezolid and meropenem and cleared her blood cultures.
Multiple C diff tests and stool cultures were negative.
The initial etiologies were due to toxic/metabolic effects, use of sedatives during intubation and renal/hepatic failure.
A head CT was negative for intracranial bleed.
