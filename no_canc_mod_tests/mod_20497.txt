This was attributed to her underlying CAP in the setting of severe baseline COPD.
A chest x-ray after extubation revealed a modest degree of pulmonary edema.
Prior to the second extubation, in an attempt to avoid flash pulmonary edema, Ms. [**Known lastname 46197**] was actively diuresed and her blood pressure was aggressively controlled with a nitrogylycerin drip.
Her blood pressure was also extremely labile and difficult to control, especially in the setting of respiratory distress and agitation.
Acute-on-chronic RF: Acute component of renal failure attributed to hypovolemia and later, to ATN, as supported by a calculated FENa of >1%.
She was aggressively rehydrated initially, and eventually had increased spontaneous diuresis and creatinine returned to baseline (on discharge, 1.4).
