She had a family member check her pulse and BP on the day of admission, and pulse = 42 (normally ~90).
In the ED, BP 160/palp HR 39 --> 120-140/22-46 HR 64  RR 23  O2 99%RA.
EKG demonstrated atrial rate @ 150, narrow complex ventricular escape @ 50, increased QTc ~ 500msec.
Physical Exam: VS: T AF BP 154/54 HR 40 RR 14 O2 94% on 2L Gen: pleasant obese female in NAD.

#) Heart block: Patient was found to be in high degree heart block, likely multilevel in nature based on EKG findings.
The patient was monitored on telemetry, with nodal blocking agents held (home nifedipine) until an EP study was performed on [**6-15**].
#) Chest pain:  No history of CAD per patient report; she has had a prior cath without intervention and reports a "negative" stress test within the past 5 years.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x 2, and ischemia was ruled out as etiology of chest pain/ SOB.
VS were stable and EKG, while showing V pacing, did not show any significant EKG changes.
Evidence of bacteria on UA was therefore treated with home dose of macrobid.
She was discharged to rehab because PT evaluation indicated that she was functioning below her baseline and she could use further PT to aid in her transfering given mobility restrictions in left arm abduction after the pacemaker was placed.
Because of this a pacemaker was placed in your heart to keep your heart rate within a normal range.
You may need a stress test to evaluate the chest pain that you had inside the hospital.
