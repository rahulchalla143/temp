This decision came about in regards to an echocardiogram showing left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, with the belief that Pt would benefit most from a BB.
A resting MIBI was performed which showed a: "mild to moderate, fixed defect in the distal anterior wall and apex, without reversibility at 24 hours."
An Echo performed on the same day showed an improved EF 0f 35% and less akinesis.
Based upon these findings a repeat cardiac catheterization was performed.
An IVC angiogram revealed an organized thrombus in the distal IVC and an IVC filter was placed."
2) Pump:  Pt with EF 40% by cath and 30% by echo, who remained euvolemic during hospitalization.
Repeat Echo showed: "left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Hct were checked frequently during the first hospital day and was stable after the 2 units of PRBC transfused during the catherization.
She was found to have a IVC clot during her second cardiac catheterization and an IVC filter was placed.
A bilateral venous U/S was performed which showed rt normal, lt chronic non-occlusive thrombus of superficial femoral vein.
There was no indication for a hypercoagulable work-up at this time given her high risk of clots secondary to immobility.

Followup Instructions: Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2405**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 59740**] on Monday [**12-12**] be sure to address initiation of Coumadin, in addition you should have a screening colonoscopy sheduled.
