The patient suffered bleed graft function with his urine output on postoperative day number one being 471 ml of urine, on postoperative day two 255 ml of urine and on postoperative day three 350 ml of urine, decreasing to 7 ml of urine on postoperative day number four.
An abdominal x-ray revealed a dilated right colon.
This was followed by a physical examination and also imaging and the decision was finally made to attempt Neostigmine therapy.
CT scan of his abdomen was obtained to rule out mechanical obstruction prior to treatment with the Neostigmine.
The patient also went in to rapid atrial fibrillation with his heart rate in the upper 100s during this event.
Some Lopressor was given but the patient's blood pressure was noted to decrease and he was therefore started on Levophed and Neo-Synephrine.
On the day following the Neostigmine therapy, which was postoperative day number five, revealed that the patient's physical examination and his labs raised concern for an intra- abdominal pathologic process.
The patient's white blood cell count was increased to 12.
The decision was made to take the patient for an exploratory laparotomy.
The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, extended right hemicolectomy with takedown of the hepatic flexure and a diverting ileostomy.
Estimated blood loss was 600 ml.
Treatment of the rapid rhythm was attempted with two boluses of Lopressor but the patient's blood pressure was noted to decrease into the 80s and 90s.
A chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe collapse.
Following the intubation, the patient's blood pressure was noted to decrease and the patient was started on a Levophed drip.
On [**2112-4-8**], the patient also underwent CT scan of his abdomen to evaluate for obstruction.
The CT scan revealed contrast to the colostomy bag.
The transplanted kidney showed no evidence of hydronephrosis and there was no peri-renal fluid collection.
On [**2112-4-10**], a followup CT scan was obtained revealing an unchanged distribution of intraoperative peritoneal oral contrast.
While at CT scan, the patient did have an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation with a decrease in his systolic blood pressure to the 70s and 80s.
Given the deterioration of the patient's condition and unclear etiology, the patient was taken for an exploratory laparotomy on [**2112-4-12**].
On [**2112-4-14**], the patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram to evaluate for endocarditis.
The patient's urine output remained minimal, ranging from 38 to 571 between the [**4-9**] and [**4-15**].
The patient's blood urea nitrogen was noted to be increasing and was 218 on [**4-16**].
This was confirmed on an x-ray obtained on [**2112-4-18**].
The patient's serum lactate was also noted to be increasing.
An echocardiogram was ordered.
Although the quality of the images obtained were poor, the study was able to verify that the patient had no pericardial effusion to explain the decreased cardiac output.
The patient's right ventricular function did appear depressed.
