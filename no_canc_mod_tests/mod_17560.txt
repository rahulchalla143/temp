Echo at OSH revealed severe MR with partially flail posterior leaflet.
There is no other significant interval change [**8-23**] Chest CT: 1.
Further evaluation with high- resolution CT of the chest is recommended if clinically indicated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
