Cardiac catheterization showed severe three-vessel disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the following:  Temperature 100.7; blood pressure 154/91; pulse 97; respiratory rate 24; saturation 95% on three liters nasal cannula.
HEAD:  Examination was unremarkable.
CHEST:  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles or wheezes.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally; no edema.
RECTAL:  Rectal examination showed trace-positive guaiac.
He underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed severe three-vessel disease with a preserved ejection fraction of 50%.
Of note, the patient's preoperative testing revealed mildly elevated LFTs of unknown etiology.
The preoperative pulmonary function tests also showed moderate to severe restrictive pattern, again, of unknown etiology.
The patient also had CAT scan of the chest, as per the Pulmonary Service, which showed diffuse interstitial changes with ground-glass appearance and areas of alveolar filling process, especially in the left upper lobe.
The patient's coagulopathy was corrected with vitamin K and FFP initially.
The patient underwent a repeat echocardiogram, which showed severe hypokinesis.
This eventually peaked at a creatinine of approximately 5.9.
The patient maintained his electrolytes and never became acidotic and continued to make urine, such that volume overload was not an issue.
Multiple sets of cultures were sent including cultures from previous bronchoscopy, blood cultures, and urine cultures.
All of these cultures failed to grow out any organisms, however.
After all these cultures came back negative, the patient's broad- spectrum antibiotic coverage was stopped.
Given the patient's increased LFTs, hepatitis panel was sent, all of which came back negative.
The total bilirubin peaked at 16 and again slowly went down to the 4 or 5 level.
Sputum culture was sent after the nurse noted increased frequency of suctioning, which grew MRSA.
