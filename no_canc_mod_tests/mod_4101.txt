He had complaints of worsening dyspnea on exertion which prompted a stress test which was positive for ischemia.
Echocardiogram in [**2175-5-9**] showed no valvular pathology and an LVEF of 60%.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization in [**2175-5-9**] was notable for severe two vessel coronary artery disease.
Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with normal right coronary artery.
Physical Exam: Pre Admit Vitals: BP 180/100, HR 72, RR 14 General: well developed male in no acute distress, appears older than stated age Skin: vitilgo pathces noted HEENT: oropharynx benign, Neck: supple, no JVD, soft carotid bruits noted Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, no murmur or rub Lungs: clear bilaterally Abdomen: obese, soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds Ext: warm, 3+ pedal edema, no varicosities Pulses: 1+ distally Neuro: nonfocal   Pertinent Results: [**2175-7-7**] 08:30AM BLOOD WBC-6.6 RBC-2.77* Hgb-8.6* Hct-24.6* MCV-89 MCH-31.0 MCHC-35.0 RDW-13.9 Plt Ct-400 [**2175-7-7**] 08:30AM BLOOD Glucose-230* UreaN-71* Creat-4.3* Na-132* K-4.9 Cl-100 HCO3-25 AnGap-12 [**2175-7-6**] 09:55AM BLOOD Glucose-136* UreaN-76* Creat-4.3* Na-136 K-4.9 Cl-101 HCO3-26 AnGap-14 [**2175-7-6**] 09:55AM BLOOD ALT-15 AST-23 LD(LDH)-296* AlkPhos-77 Amylase-44 TotBili-0.4  PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Aortic valve disease.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Conclusions: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
POST-BYPASS: Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function is normal.
He did experience a further decline in renal function as his creatinine peaked to 4.4.
Diuretics were titrated and by discharge, his renal function has stabilized, with a creatinine of 4.3 for the past 2 days (4.4 prior to that).
