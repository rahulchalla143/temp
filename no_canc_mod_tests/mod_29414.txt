CT chest revealed dense colidation in LUL.
Interventional Pulmonology was consulted and bronch was performed - blood clot was seen at the level of the carina, between the apicoposterior and anterior segments of the left upper lobe.
Pt's HCT was stable at that time, she was not transfused.

Calcified mediastinal, hilar, and mesenteric lymph nodes with calcified granulomas in the lung and liver, compatible with prior granulomatous disease (patient is known to have had prior treated tuberculosis).
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS [**2113-7-19**]: 1.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2113-7-28**]: Improved multifocal airspace consolidation.
The patient's INR was high and of unclear etiology.
CTA was done and PE was diagnosed.
Lower extremity doppler was done and no DVT was found.
An upper extremety ultrasound was done and it showed bilateral clots, but no treatment was undertaken because of the recent history of hemoptysis.
<br> All sputum cultures were negative, but the patient was placed on respiratory precautions and started on four drug treatment.
Lung adenocarcinoma was also considered in the differential.
since multiple AFB negative sputum cultures had been collected.
C.diff toxins were sent and returned back negative x3.
They recommended a transthoracic approach and a biopsy was scheduled.
However, the medical team, in discussion with the patient and her daughters decided to first do a repeat CT scan which showed improvement.
As Ms.Y was clinically stable it was decided to cancel the biopsy and treat Ms.Y for a presumed necrotizing pneumonia.
Ms.Y was begun with a low therapeutic target of a PTT between 40-59.
She was then transitioned to coumadin and after INR levels showed target levels of [**2-19**] she was taken off of the heparin.
She had a final repeat CT which showed improvement of the left upper lobe lesion and complete resolution of the bilateral pleural effusions.
She is being discharged on coumadin with scheduled blood checks and follow up with her primary care Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] the day after discharge.
INR therapeutic.
You were started on a blood thinner called coumadin (warfarin) for the blood clots in your lungs.
You will need to closely follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to monitor the levels of blood thinners.
You will have to have your blood drawn 2-3 times per week (likely Tuesday and Friday) and depending on the results Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] may instruct you to increase or decrease the amount of coumadin you take.
