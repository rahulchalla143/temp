With dose changes in diuretics, his BUN came down to 190 and creatinine down to 3.8.
His white blood cell count was noted elevated on admission and continued to increase but this was felt to be too large for a steroid dose.
At the outside hospital, he was afebrile with negative blood cultures and skin cultures.
Skin biopsies were performed which did not support the diagnosis of vasculitis per report, although no specific details of the biopsy were available.
Ultrasound showed no deep vein thromboses, no specific arterial stenosis.
Based on the patient's status not improving, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
Renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 3.0 to 3.5.
The patient was afebrile; blood pressure 140/90; pulse 72; breathing at 22; saturation 99% on room air.
HEENT examination was unremarkable.
Lungs are clear to auscultation except for some decreased breath sounds at the right base.
Cardiovascular examination had distant heart sounds; regular rate and rhythm, a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border radiating into the axilla.
Neurological examination was within normal limits.
LABORATORY:  On admission included a white blood cell count of 23.8, a hematocrit of 34.5, platelets of 171.
INR on admission was 1.6 with a PT of 15, a PTT of 29.
Chem-7 revealed a glucose of 91, a BUN of 171, creatinine 3.1.
Sodium 141, potassium of 3.9, chloride of 99, bicarbonate of 30, anion gap of 16.
The patient had a biopsy which showed evidence of changes from ischemic vasculitis, but possibly a component of calciphylaxis.
He then went back again on the 25th for a left above the knee amputation due to the severe nature of the ischemia and the ulcers that were being caused.
He was ultimately taken to the Electrophysiology Laboratory where he was induced and a ventricular tachycardia ablation was performed.
Acute renal failure:  The patient came in with a creatinine of 3.1 which went to 3.6 the next day.
After these few sessions of dialysis, his creatinine returned down to 3.3.
The cause of his renal failure was believed to be ATN, possibly due to hypotension at some point during his stay, since muddy brown casts were seen on a urine sediment examination.
At the time of discharge, he had not had a dialysis for four days and his creatinine had remained in the mid-3 range.
An additional renal issue was that the patient had an incredibly high phosphors during his stay, with the level getting as high as 7.6 on [**3-14**].
He had initially been treated with Remegel to avoid constipation, but once his calcium phosphate product got so high and calciphylaxis was considered in the differential, it was decided to put him on Amphojel.
Hematology:  At the time of admission, the patient's hematocrit was 32.1.
On [**3-5**], he had a hematocrit drop down to 23.
He was given six units of blood and his repeat hematocrit was unchanged.
CT scan of the abdomen was performed which was negative.
The patient was guaiac negative, and after additional units of blood his hematocrit again returned up to the 30 range and he was transferred back to the Floor.
This happened a second time on [**3-15**], where his hematocrit dropped to 24.3.
This time, we did not transfer him to the Medical Intensive Care Unit but we continued to give him blood and his hematocrit finally came up.
Iron studies were done and he was slightly iron deficient so he was given iron supplementation.
Once he was dialyzed and his renal function improved, this hematocrit dropping phenomena ceased to be a problem.
At the day of discharge, his hematocrit was 33.4 and it had been in the mid-30s for the four days prior to that.
Hemolysis labs were unrevealing as well during this work-up.
They recommended checking a sedimentation rate which was high at 127 but the patient had known infection of his stump at this time and was on antibiotics, and it was deemed that this was not a reliable marker.
A temporal artery biopsy was performed which was negative.
The patient was recommended to have a full ophthalmologic work-up as an outpatient since there was nothing that could be done acutely for him in the hospital.
A culture on the [**3-25**] revealed only coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
Tissue biopsy from one of his wounds revealed Serratia and coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
At the time of discharge, he had had negative blood cultures for two weeks; he had been afebrile.
His white count was elevated, but this was believed to be secondary to the large doses of steroids he was receiving for his ophthalmalgic issues.
His white count remained elevated, but seemed to be slowly dropping and he was deemed safe to go home.
Ultrasounds were done which were unrevealing for deep vein thrombosis.
