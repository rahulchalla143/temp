Went to ED for evaluation and found to have elevated amylase (424 --> 681) and lipase (1245 --> 1154).
CT scan of abdomen demonstrated significant necrotizing pancreatitis with significant abnormal pleural fluid.
He also had a recurrent fever (Tm 105) and was hypoxia with O2 sats in low 90's on 6-8L high flow.
He was seen by gastroenterology and treated with aldactone 50 [**Hospital1 **] and lasix for ascites and to improve urine output.
Because of the worsening CT scan on [**12-15**] and clinical deterioration, patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Past Medical History: 1)Idiopathic Pancreatitis - Seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3315**] in [**2134**] - First in [**2130**] after heavy ETOH, second [**2131**] after a car accident and light ETOH, another after fatty foods (not ETOH), another after ERCP (amylase range of 1800-[**2135**], pain relieved by brief hospitalization).
- MRCP with no pancreatic divisum ([**2134**]) - CF gene negative 2)Kidney Stones 3)GERD 4)UTI 5)Spinal stenosis s/p fusion in [**2123**] 6)HTN 7)Seasonal allergies 8)Ulnar nerve entrapment surgery in [**2132**]  Social History: +tob, pt states no ETOH recently but told surgery that he drinks a 6pk of beer a day and told attending 1 br/day on occasion.

1)Necrotizing pancreatitis - 40% necrotized on admission CT scan to our institution, with preservation of pancreatic head and tail.
Repeat CT showed overall improved appearance of pancreas although there is some organization of pancreatic inflammation.
As pancreatic enzymes trended downwards and his clinical status improved, his diet was advanced.
Daily blood and urine cultures were unrevealing.
ETOH withdrawal:  Per psychiatric evaluation and high benzodiazepine requirement, acute mental status changes likely secondary to EtOH withdrawal.
Head CT without intracranial abnormalities.
Cxray showed large L pleural effusion, likely secondary to pancreatitis.
