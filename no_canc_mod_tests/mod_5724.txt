Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 427**] for pericardial effusions and was found to have small RV perforation during initial PPM placement.
Her pacer leads were repositioned, and the effusion was monitored.
Last CXR on [**7-23**] prior to discharge showed small L pleural effusion and trace R pleural effusion.
At rehab she was doing well until 2 days ago when, after her cardiology appointment, she suddenly felt very cold and began having chills.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.6, 80, 102/58, 24, 93% 4L Nasal Cannula.
Her baseline SBP is 130s-140s, and she was in the 90s in the ED so she was admitted to the ICU for monitoring.
EKG showed LBBB (unchanged from baseline).
CXR showed L pleural effusion and bedside echo showed a small pericardial effusion that was measured as 0.4cm.
Vitals on transfer were 92/61, 78, 20, 97% 3-4L NC.

There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-7-23**], the findings are similar.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2155-8-8**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.

# Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Her systolic blood pressure during this admission ranged from 90s-140s.
We found her to be fluid over loaded on arrival to the floor, and noted that [**2155-8-1**] ECHO showed EF in 30% felt to be due to pacer-induced mechanical dysynchrony of pacing, and began diuresis with IV lasix.
Her EKG is notable for a prior LBBB as well as a wide QRS complex and atrial fibrillation.
Coumadin therapy was held and her INR dropped down to a safe level for thoracentesis.
Analysis of the pleural fluid revealed a exudative effusion with lymphocytic predominance.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained and were negative.
A MRSA as well as a legionella screen were also negative as well.
The pleural fluid was sent for culture and was finalized with no bacterial growth.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Her INR on admission was supratherapeutic.
Upon discharge her INR was 1.3.
# Normocytic Anemia: Likely mixed picture with iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease based on iron studies done last admission.
Her hematocrit on admission and through out remained within her recent baseline.
#Transitional: Her INR should be followed up regularly to determine whether INR remains in theraputic ranges for a.fib.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw INR and fax results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27542**], the fax number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34527**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Nursing Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Pneumonia with Exudative Pleural Effusion  Secondary Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation Congestive Heart Failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We have now restarted Coumadin for you diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and you will have to have your INR checked regularly to insure you are on the appropriate dose.
