CXR ([**2144-6-9**]): UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is normal.
CXR [**6-10**] Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2144-6-9**].
There is otherwise no change since the prior study demonstrated.
Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier.
Right upper lobe opacity is either new or more conspicuous than on prior studies and is consistent with infectious process/pneumonia.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Psychiatry consulted, recommended 1:1 sitter which was continued throughout the admission.
Acute kidney injury: presumed to be pre-renal in setting of somnolence and poor PO intake, improved with fluids.
QACHS blood glucose checks, coverage with Humalog sliding scale as per her home regimen.
After that point in time her blood pressures were well controlled on the floor.
