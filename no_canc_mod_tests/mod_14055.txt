She had a follow-up head computed tomography which showed a resolving subarachnoid hemorrhage, one resolving subdural hemorrhage, with some persistent subdural hemorrhage that had not grown in size.
She slowly decreased her oxygen requirement and began to have oxygen saturations on room air.
A follow-up chest x-ray was ordered which showed a stable left pleural effusion, a decreased right pleural effusion, and overall improved examination.
She had one temperature spike on [**10-20**], at which time her central line was discontinued, and follow-up cultures were performed.
A follow-up culture of the line tip as well as [**3-1**] blood cultures showed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus which was sensitive to vancomycin.
After the addition of vancomycin, repeat blood cultures remained negative.
Her blood pressure remained stable throughout her hospital course.
A search was done to look for additional infectious causes, and stool cultures were sent to look for Clostridium difficile (which was negative), and follow-up blood cultures were also negative.
Abdominal laboratories were drawn showed no evidence of intra-abdominal process or infection.
The cause of the patient's white blood cell count was unknown, but was thought to in part be related to central nervous system effect from her intracranial hemorrhage.
After increasing her metoprolol dose we then added diltiazem 60 mg by mouth four times per day with much improved decrease in her heart rates.
Her lisinopril was decreased to 20 mg by mouth once per day to avoid any decrease in blood pressures.
After her neck brace had been removed, and the patient began to improve with her mental status, a Speech and Swallow evaluation showed that the patient was safe to have soft diet without risk of aspiration pneumonia.
An anemia workup was done, and it was felt that the patient had anemia of chronic disease.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout her hospital course, and no blood transfusions were needed.
The patient was also instructed to follow up as an outpatient with Neurosurgery for an outpatient evaluation of resolving subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural bleed in 2 weeks with a repeat Head CT 3.
