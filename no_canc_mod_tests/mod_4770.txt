The patient saw his outpatient cardiologist following discharge, asked to wear a holter monitor which showed 3 second pauses.
His initial vital signs were T 100.7, HR 102 (irregular) and BP 158/90.
He had a CXR which showed evidence of a LUL opacity.
He was found to be in a rapid ventricular rate with A fib, and treated with IV lopressor.
In the ICU, a TTE showed an EF of 20-25% with severe global hypokinesis, dilated LA, mild TR, and no other valvular dysfunction.
CE's were sent and the initial set showed CK 353, MB 20, Trop I 15.5, then repeat at 2 am CK 395, MB 55, Trop I 9.0, then prior to transfer was CK 1506, MB 299, Trop I 43.3.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+  Pertinent Results: [**3-31**]- INR 1.3  [**3-19**] CARDIAC CATH: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated severe native three vessel disease.
Venous conduit arteriography showed SVG/RCA and SVG/OM occlusion.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular enddiastolic filling pressures at 14 and 15 mmHg, respectively.
The mean PA pressure was 27 mmHg (phasic 40/16 mmHg).
The cardiac index was depressed at 1.6 L/min/m2.
The mean systolic arterial pressure was 71 mmHg (phasic 105/51 mmHg).
[**3-20**] Chest CT: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed LVEF= 30 %).
LV ventricular function and RV function are unchanged.
He underwent further work-up which included chest CT and carotid U/S prior to surgery.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
