PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs on admission revealed a temperature of 97.3?????
?F, a pulse of 54, a blood pressure of 130/70 and an oxygen saturation of 99% on three liters by nasal cannula.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, the patient had a slight droop of her left eyelid noted.
The coronary examination revealed a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur.
BUN on admission was 21 with a creatinine of 1.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on [**2150-7-21**], where she was found to have severe aortic stenosis, severe mitral regurgitation, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% and three vessel coronary artery disease.
On postoperative day #8, [**2150-8-1**], the patient was on nasal cannula oxygen with marginal oxygen saturation in the 90% to 93% range.
A chest x-ray was obtained and it was noted that the patient had a significant left sided pleural effusion, thought to be a hemothorax.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and a subsequent chest x-ray showed the tube to be in good position with evacuation of the effusion.
Her respiratory status significantly improved over the next 24 hours with an oxygen saturation up to 100%.
Her oxygen saturation was stable at 99%.
On postoperative day #14, the patient had a prothrombin time of 14.3 with an INR of 1.4 on her newly resumed Coumadin.
On [**2150-8-8**], the chest tube was discontinued when her INR had reached 2.1 and there was no evidence of bleeding.
A culture of that wound was sent and the result of that was sparse growth of E. coli.
The patient's most recent chest x-ray is from [**2150-8-10**], which showed cardiomegaly and some degree of congestive heart failure with bilateral atelectasis, left greater than right, which was essentially unchanged from her previous film.
The patient has a temperature of 98.4?????
?F, a pulse of 61 in normal sinus rhythm, a respiratory rate of 18 and a blood pressure of 135/56 with an oxygen saturation of 97% on two liters by nasal cannula.
Her blood sugars have ranged from 140 to 220.
Her weight today is 78.8 kg, which is still up somewhat from her preoperative weight of 73.4 kg.
MOST RECENT LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's most recent laboratory values reveal a white blood cell count of 6100, hematocrit of 29.2, sodium of 131, potassium of 4.4, BUN of 26, creatinine of 1.1 and magnesium of 1.9.
The patient's INR on [**2150-8-11**] as well as on [**2150-8-12**] was 1.9 and on both of those days she received 3 mg of Coumadin.
Her INR from today, [**2150-8-13**], is pending.
Her target INR should be 2 to 2.5 for treatment of postoperative paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
On pulmonary examination, the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally in the upper lobes with a few bibasilar crackles.
The coronary examination is a regular rate and rhythm.
Sliding scale regular insulin before meals and at bedtime as follows:  for a blood sugar of 150 to 200, three units subcutaneously; for 201 to 250, six units; and, for 251 to 300, nine units.
ANTICOAGULATION:  The patient's Coumadin dose for today has not yet been determined, pending prothrombin time results; her target INR should be 2.0 to 2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
