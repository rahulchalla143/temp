Upon arrival to OSH he was found to be in atrial flutter with BP 161/128.
CT head showed a large right occipital IPH and was given fosphenytoin, Ativan, started on a dilt drip and transferred here.
Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2139-3-26**] 5:28 PM 1.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2139-3-28**] 1.
Findings on CT angiography of the head suggest a most likely an arteriovenous malformation in the region of hemorrhage within tortuous arterial structures supplying the region with a 5-mm density could represent compressed nidus or venous aneurysm.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2139-4-2**] 1.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2139-4-5**]: No significant interval change.
Repeat head CT showed that the hemorrhage had grown to 4 x 2.3cm with edema but no midline shift.
A TTE showed an EF >75% and impaired relaxation.
On [**3-28**] he was tachycardiac, cardiac enzymes were sent but negative.
A CTA was performed which showed an underlying AVM.
On [**3-30**] he underwent a TEE which showed no clot and then underwent cardioversion into normal sinus rhythm.
He remained stable and on [**4-1**] he underwent a Angiogram for embolization of the AVM.
Post-embolization, his SBP was kept below 110, this was acheived with Labetolol IV PRN, no drip was required.
On [**4-2**] he remained stable and visual fields appeared improved, his SBP was liberalized to 160.
Once therapeutic, a head CT was done which was stable.
No driving until you are no longer taking pain medications   Followup Instructions: Follow up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks with a CT scan of the Brain.
