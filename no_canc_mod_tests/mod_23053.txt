On [**8-14**] she became relatively somnolent, and CT scan showed a significant amount of remaining ventricular blood.
At least daily CT scans were performed from [**2146-8-13**] until [**2146-8-16**], and revealed stable left thalamic, intraventricular, subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhages.
A head CT repeated [**2146-8-23**] showed a decrease in the size of left thalamic hemorrhage in addition to improvement of occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and ventriculostomy site hemorrhage.
As her exam improved significantly following the EVD placement, she was extubated on [**2146-8-13**].
By the time of discharge, her O2 saturation was above 94% on ambient air.
Blood cultures, urinalysis and culture, and chest x-rays failed to show contributory infection.
As amylase and lipase were found to be elevated, a CT of the abdomen was performed to evaluate for pancreatitis.
The study was negative.
