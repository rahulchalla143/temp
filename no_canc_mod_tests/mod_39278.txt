A recent interrogation in [**Month (only) 216**] revealed noise with inhibition of ventricular pacing with his fidelis RV lead.
Patient was found to have hyperglycemia to 400s this AM when presenting to the OR with initial ABG showing 7.17/43/328/17.
He had a hyperchloremic, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and had a normal lactate.
During the case, he received 1 unit of pRBCs, 3L NS and calcium with a couple amps of bicarb to help his acid/base.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - CABG: S/p MI and CABG in [**2112**] ([**Hospital3 **]), unknown anatomy.

Initial LV systolic function was depressed with LVEF = 30-35%, this improved to LVEF 35-45% with dual ventriular pacing.
CXR [**10-29**]: The patient is intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above the carina.

Patient had persistant hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis post-extubation with an elevated urine pH and urine anion gap suggesting a distal renal tubular acidosis.
He will have labs drawn two days after discharge to ensure electrolyte stability.
# Chronic systolic CHF: He just received replacement BiV pacemaker and his EF improved from 30-35% on admisison to LVEF 35-45% post-procedurely.
Hemolysis labs were negative, and there were no signs of bleeding.
-patient will need his electrolytes closely monitored as an outpatient -patient will need his CBC and platelet count checked in [**4-11**] days.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw CBC and chem 7 on Tuesday, [**11-3**] and fax results to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Please also have labs drawn on Tuesday, and the results sent to your PCP.
