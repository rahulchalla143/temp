At [**Hospital3 **], the patient was found to be in a junctional bradycardia as low as 15; he had a BP 105/70, Cr of 3.5, and K was 6.5.
?s HR remained 18-20 with SBP of 105-147, with an oxygen saturation of 92% on a NRB.
An ABG was obtained, with a gas of 7.02/43/102, potassium of 7.3, and lactate of 7.0.
His pulse became thready and systolic blood pressures dropped into the 60s.
The patient received a total of 3 amps of atropine, 2 pushes of epi, 2g of calcium, and 2 amps of bicarb.
The patient regained a normal HR at 80 and BP of 120/50.
He had a CT scan of his abdomen for which a preliminary read suggested colitis and pancreatitis without contrast extravasation into the peritoneum.
When he was transferred to the MICU he remained on dopamine as a pressor but the nursing staff were soon able to stop this, after which his pressures remain stable and MAPS remained >65.

His CT scan included findings of possible pancreatitis (supported by high pancreatic enzymes) and colitis (which might be source of high but now lower lactate).
Sepsis may have been an underlying issue; cultures are pending.
# Hyperkalemia: Patient had failed to get labs checked and kayexelate was not producing usual BM.
* [**12-4**] HCT drop in setting of self discontinuation of fem line (patient pulled out) - CT abd/pelvis negative for intra or retroperitoneal bleed, received 2 units of PRBCs.
Patient had glucose of 606 in CCU with consistent hyperglycemia; may be secondary to pancreatic injury.
Urine, CXR and blood culture negative growth.
# Anemia: The patient dropped his Hct in the setting of losing his femoral HD line.
Last HD session on [**12-4**].
Good urine output (> 2 L), lytes in normal limits therefore temporary HD line was removed.
Patient was monitored on tele while on the floor.
