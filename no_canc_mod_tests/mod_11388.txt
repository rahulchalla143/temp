The patient then presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department for evaluation and treatment.
His vital signs in the Emergency Department were as follows: Temperature 97.2 F.; heart rate 91; blood pressure 121/75; respiratory rate 16; oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
A nasogastric lavage was negative for blood.
External hemorrhoids were noted on physical examination and he was guaiac positive.
The rest of his physical exam was unremarkable.
Moreover, an EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at the rate of 122, with ST depressions noted in leads II, III, AVF, and V4 through V6.
The complete blood cell count came back with a white blood cell count of 18.5, platelet count 310, and hematocrit of 12.2.
Last colonoscopy in [**2154**].
CT scan of the head and cervical spine films, and MRI of cervical spine were all negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission, vital signs were temperature of 98.6 F.; blood pressure 120/66; heart rate 74; respiratory rate 20; oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart regular, audible but distant S1 and S2 heart sounds.
Rectal examination with prominent external hemorrhoids noted.
The rest of the examination is deferred.
LABORATORY AND PERTINENT STUDIES:  Complete blood cell count on transfer to the General Medicine Floor demonstrated a CBC with white blood cell count of 9.5, hematocrit 29.5, platelet count 197.
Serum chemistry showed a sodium of 141, potassium 4.0, chloride 110, bicarbonate 25, BUN 8, creatinine 0.7, glucose 85.
Urinalysis was negative.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2158-7-25**], was normal esophagus, normal stomach, normal duodenum; no signs of gastrointestinal bleed.
Colonoscopy on [**2158-7-25**]: Normal colon; no sign of lower GI bleed.
Abdominal ultrasound on [**2158-7-27**], with normal abdominal ultrasound.
Head CT scan with contrast on [**2158-7-26**], with no evidence of chronic subdural hematoma or intracranial mass effect.
On [**2158-7-25**], an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed.
The colonoscopy revealed a normal appearing colon with the stigmata of recent bleeding and his internal and external hemorrhoids.
Following these studies, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was stabilized and transferred to the floor for further evaluation and management on [**2158-7-25**].
Overnight, however, his hematocrit dropped from 29.5 to 25.6, and he received another unit of blood in the early morning of [**2158-7-26**].
His hematocrit subsequently rose back to the level of 30.5.
Of note, the patient reports that he can hold the blood in, suggesting accumulation of blood from the internal hemorrhoids.
He received a head CT scan with contrast which was normal, and was evaluated by the Neurology consultation service.
They indicated that a head MRI would not be necessary as this appeared to be an acute on chronic headache with a component due to post-concussive syndrome.
Once the patient's hematocrit and volume status was under control, there were no other incidences of syncope.
Given the patient's acute gastrointestinal bleed, a right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed which was normal.
