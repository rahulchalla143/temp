She presented to the Emergency Department on [**Hospital3 4298**] and was found to have an electrocardiogram with questionable ST elevations.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed the patient's heart rate was 70, her blood pressure was 168/80, and her respiratory rate was 14.
In general, the patient appeared comfortable in the Emergency Department but with complaints of [**3-18**] to 3/10 chest pain.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the oropharynx was clear.
Neck examination revealed jugular venous pulsation approximately 7 cm.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed the patient had no edema.
The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories from the outside hospital revealed the patient's potassium was 3.1, blood urea nitrogen was 17, and creatinine was 0.7.
Laboratories from [**Hospital1 69**] revealed a complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 13.9, her hematocrit was 39, and her platelets were 276.
Her creatine kinase was 50.
Her INR was 0.9.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy, 1-mm ST elevations in leads III and aVF.
All of these were noted to be new since prior electrocardiogram in [**2102-11-7**].
Right-sided and posterior leads revealed no ST elevations in V3 to V4 and V3 and V4; respectively.
A chest x-ray revealed normal heart size.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Coronary artery disease: The cardiac catheterization revealed the following; (1) left anterior descending artery with a proximal calcified 70% lesion; (2) left circumflex with mid thrombotic 60% lesion; and, (3) right coronary artery with minimal disease.
The patient had percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting of culprit 60% left circumflex lesion and was subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further monitoring.
A fasting lipid panel revealed a cholesterol of 199, low-density lipoprotein was 121, and high-density lipoprotein was 51.
She was to have an outpatient stress test to evaluate the need for future intervention on the 70% proximal left anterior descending artery lesion.
The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient was instructed to follow up with her primary care physician (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12536**] who had been notified and made aware of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course and subsequent need for a stress test to identify any need for further revascularization of the 70% proximal left anterior descending artery lesion.
