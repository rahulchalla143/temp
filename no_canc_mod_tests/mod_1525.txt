CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK:  The CT angiography of the neck is slightly limited secondary to venous contamination.
CTA OF THE HEAD:  The CTA of the head demonstrates narrowing and tapering of the right middle cerebral artery near the bifurcation with diminished filling of the right sylvian branches.
Acute right middle cerebral artery infarct which has evolved since the previous CT of [**2127-1-24**].
Patchy opacities at visualized both lung apices, correlation with chest plain film is recommended.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
1) Right MCA infarction- Her examination at presenation revealed worsened left sided weakness, new left UMN facial droop, right gaze deviation, and possible eye opening apraxia.
A CT confirmed new R MCA territory infarct.
MRI could not be performed due to patient's cardiac pacemaker.
The likely etiology of her stroke was cardioembolic due to subtherapeutic INR of 1.9 at presentation.
The patient was started on Heparin IV drip at 13units/kg with a goal PTT of 50-70.
Echocardiogram revealed preserved EF with 1+ MR via her bioprosthetic valve.
There was no echo evidence for intracardiac source of emboli.
CTA head and neck revealed high grade right MCA stenosis and partial occlusion.
Her LDL was 81, and her Hbg A1c 6.1.
