Following GI prep he underwent colonoscopy which showed significant diverticulosis and evidence of prior bleeding at the site of one divertila, but no active bleeding.
His hematocrit remained stable.
Weekly OPAT labs were performed in hospital.
Surveillance blood culture and inflammatory markers were drawn given episodes of sweating in association with exacerbation of Parkinson's symptoms.
If his SBP remains > 130, his lisinopril can be increased to 40 mg (home dose) on [**4-30**].
