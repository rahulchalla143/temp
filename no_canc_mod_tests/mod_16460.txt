============== OTHER STUDIES ============== TTE [**2110-3-5**]: IMPRESSION: Preserved regional and global left ventricular function.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
Chest Radiograph [**2110-3-5**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-1**]: Severe cardiomegaly has worsened and there is mild interstitial edema, but most significant change is new moderate right pleural effusion.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis w/o Contrast [**2110-3-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Moderate intra- and extra-hepatic pneumobilia, findings consistent with recent ERCP and sphincterotomy.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo F with afib/TIA on coumadin, systolic heart failure (unknown EF), COPD on 3L NC, DM2, gastroparesis and gastritis who was for planned biliary stent removal with course complicated by cholangitis/sepsis.
When final blood cultures grew two species of E coli both sensitive to ceftriaxone she was transitioned to this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] as well as metronidazole to cover any occult anerobes given source.
2) Acute blood loss anemia: Patient had gastrointestinal blood loss in the context of sphinctertomy and received three units of pRBC's in the MICU with improvement of her hematocrit, which was stable thereafter.
Given no obvious large volume bleed CT scan of abdomen was performed to rule out RP bleed and this was negative.
3) Bacteriuria: Though initial urine culture was negative repeat culture with small organism burden of E coli.
Video swallow study showed no clear dysphagia and patient had no choking, coughing, or worsened hypoxemia so no suggestion of aspiration.
5) OSA: Patient with known OSA and echo with pulmonary hypertension.
