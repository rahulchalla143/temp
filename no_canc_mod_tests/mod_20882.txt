MRI also revealed profound stenosis of origin of left common iliac artery.
In the cath lab, the patient had 95% renal artery stenosis, 90% stenosis of right and left common iliac artery and underwent stenting bilateral CIAs and right renal artery which was complicated by a femoral bleed since the patient was on heparin and a loading dose, was off Plavix.
She had 400 cc of urine output with an estimated blood loss of 50 cc.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to cephalosporins which give her a rash, Effexor which gives her shaking and Norvasc and tape.
REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  Negative except for the present complaint described in the HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 96.7, heart rate was 66, respirations 20, blood pressure was 143/66.
Head and neck exam have slight oozing from right IJ site.
Carotid pulses were 2+, no bruits were auscultated.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular exam showed normal S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lower extremity pulse exam: Right 1+ DP, 1+ PT; left 1+ DP, 1+ PT.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Cardiac catheterization on [**2192-11-8**], by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] where she underwent successful stenting of bilateral common iliac arteries and successful stenting of the right renal artery.
The patient had an estimated 50 cc blood loss, was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and given 2 liters of crystalloid in the OR.
Electrocardiogram performed on [**2192-11-8**], showed sinus bradycardia.
She had some hemodynamic instability with mean arterial pressures of 55 to 60 overnight with wide pulse pressure, presumably due to noncompliant vessels which was corrected with fluid boluses.
Hematocrit dropped from 32 to 29 but she received a lot of fluids so the drop in hematocrit was attributed to dilution and no transfusion was done.
Recommended transfusion of the patient for a hematocrit below 26, pain control and monitoring the groin site.
We considered CT of abdomen and ultrasound if the hematocrit continues to fall but stayed stable around 30 so no further imaging was supposed to be necessary.
Hematocrit was stable at 31 to 33.
Except for the postoperative period, the patient's blood pressure continued to be elevated and ranged from 120 to 198/74 to 78.
Chronic renal insufficiency: She was admitted with a creatinine of 2.7 which improved with fluids.
She was discharged with a creatinine of 1.4 which is close to her baseline.
