History of 160 pack years tobacco ([**2-6**] ppd over 40-45 years).
Pertinent Results: ECHO [**2111-4-14**]: IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
CT [**2111-4-19**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
KUB [**2111-4-22**]: Progression of duodenal and proximal jejunal small bowel distention worrisome for evolving proximal small-bowel obstruction.
CTA chest [**2111-4-10**]: IMPRESSION:  1.
Dilated proximal CBD up to 9-mm with mildly prominent right hepatic duct, new since the last CT study dated [**2111-4-19**].
[**2111-4-30**] CT abd: High-grade small-bowel obstruction with transition point in the left mid abdomen given the swirling appearance of the vessels/bowel loops is concerning for internal hernia or volvulus.
The patient underwent R BKA on [**2111-4-6**], which again went well without complication.
As such, cardiology was consulted and they recommended getting an ECHO to rule out heart issues.
A CT chest was performed that showed extensive bilateral PEs, so patient was started on a heparin drip which was titrated to a goal PTT 60-80.
The patient was transitioned to coumadin with a goal INR of [**2-5**].
However, the patient became supratherapeutic initially, and coumadin was held, and then the INR dropped to subtherapeutic levels, likely due to improved nutrition.
The patient's Chest CT scan also showed enlarging pulmonary nodules with mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy.
A CT scan was performed that showed evolving pSBO.
Repeat CT scan showed improvement in the SBO, but KUB showed persistent dilated loop of small bowel.
His NGT was removed on [**2111-4-24**] and he was advanced to sips & clears.
An NGT was placed back in and he was   kept NPO for the next few days.
An Abdomina XR was done that showed dilated bowel loops.
A liver UWSG was done the following day since the patient was complaining of right upper quadrant pain.
A CT abdomen with PO contrast was done which showed high grade small bowel obstruction.
He was taken to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy by the West 1 surgery service, where he underwent an extensive lysis of adhesions on [**2111-4-30**].
On [**2111-5-12**], the patient obtained a RUQ ultrasound for evaluation of rising alkaline phosphatase levels, which demonstrated gallbladder sludge without notable change in intrahepatic duct size and the same extrahepatic duct size.
He was transfused two units of blood on [**2111-4-8**] because his HCT was 25.
Coumadin 1 mg Tablet Sig: TO BE DOSED DAILY BASED ON INR VALUE Tablet PO once a day.
9. enoxaparin 60 mg/0.6 mL Syringe Sig: One (1) SHOT Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours) for 1 weeks: PLEASE GIVE UNTIL PATIENT'S INR IS THERAPEUTIC.
