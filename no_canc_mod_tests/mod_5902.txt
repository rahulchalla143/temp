Pt had previously been hospitalized at [**Hospital6 6689**] numerous times for Crohn's colitis and resultant diarrhea, deyhydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.
During the admission, she was clinically thought to have a vesicular-sigmoid fistula, although this was not demonstrated on CT scan.

LVEF 55% Based on [**2094**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
CT C/A/P [**2104-7-9**]: 1.
LOWER EXTREMITY U/S [**2104-7-17**]: The left common femoral vein demonstrates intraluminal thrombus and is not completely compressible, although it is patent.
TTE [**2104-7-18**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-6-30**], no major change is evident.
SHOULDER 1 VIEW LEFT  [**2104-7-29**] 1:55 PM Two radiographs of the left shoulder demonstrate anatomic alignment of the glenohumeral joint.
IMPRESSION: Limited study given single angle of projection.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US  [**2104-7-28**] 1:43 PM LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler ultrasound of the left internal jugular, subclavian, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins was performed.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2104-7-22**] no diagnostic change.
Pt had previously been hospitalized at [**Hospital6 6689**] numerous times for Crohn's colitis and resultant diarrhea, deyhydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.
During the admission, she was clinically thought to have a vaginal/sigmoid fistula, although this was not demonstrated on CT scan.
Shortly after admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the pt had episode of hypotension with BP 60/doppler.
Shortly after starting levophed, she experienced [**3-31**] chest pressure and experienced increased ectopy on telemetry.
Levophed was stopped, and SBP decreased to the 70's.
Pt's chest pressure resolved, however she became tachy to 120's and remained hypotensive.
She also had urine cultures positive for >100k yeast, that was treated with one dose of fluconazole.
She then had episodes of bradycardia with HR in the 40s o/n that were asymptomatic.
To look for possible abscess around her fistula, the pt underwent a Abd/pelvic CT scan on [**7-9**] that did not show any evidence for abscess, but a DVT in her LLE was found incidentally.
After refusing LENI for further evaluation, the pt was started on heparin drip and returned to the medicine floor.
Blood cultures taken during this episode of tachycardia and hypotension subsequently grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus and coag-positive staph, and sepsis vs. adrenal insufficiency were suspected to be the precipitation factor.
A TTE was performed on [**7-15**] to evaluate her for endocarditis in the setting of MRSA and VRE bacteremia but showed no evidence of valve vegetation.
Cefepime & vancomycin d/c'd on [**7-19**].
# Bacteremia: hypotension, tachycardia Positive blood cultures from [**7-15**] have grown VRE/MRSA; suspected sepsis as cause of hypotensive episodes.
TTE on [**7-15**] showed no evidence of valve vegetation.
Cefepime & vancomycin d/c'd on [**7-19**].
Daily blood cultures since [**7-16**] have been negative.
A tranesophageal echocardiogram revealed small, partially mobile echodensity on the aortic valve as described above c/w (but not diagnositic of) a vegetation.
# DVT: Filling defect in left femoral vein found incidentally on CT pelvis.
Left upper extremity ultrasound to evaluate for clot was negative which decreased concern for HIT and checking heparin dependent antibody was not clinically indicated given normal platelet counts.
Per Cardiology input, she is at moderate cardiac risk for peri-operative complications; however, cardiac catheterization is not indicated.
BP stabilized after starting stress dose steroids prior to surgery and she has remained normotensive post-op.
# Adrenal insufficiency: [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency.
It may have been contributing to her persistent hypotension with SBP in 90s before surgery.
She is now hemodynamically stable with SBP 130s.
Iron studies indicated anemia of chronic disease.
Valproate Sodium 250 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: One (1)  PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)).
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
