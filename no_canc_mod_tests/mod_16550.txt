Patient presented to [**Hospital6 3426**] and was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation and cardiac catheterization.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Pulse was 66 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure was 149/54, respiratory rate 19, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
Neurologically, awake, alert, cooperative, and oriented x3.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in V2-V3.
X-RAYS:  Chest x-ray at the outside hospital was reported to show mild congestive heart failure.
Patient ruled in for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 1.58.
Patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on [**2102-7-31**] and in the cardiac catheterization laboratory the patient was found to have a left ventricular ejection fraction at 50%, a 50% left main coronary artery lesion, 90% long mid LAD lesion, 80% ostial OM-1 lesion, and 80% proximal right coronary artery lesion with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, and a LVEDP of 16.
Patient had an echocardiogram subsequent to her cardiac catheterization which showed a depressed ejection fraction at 35% with anterior wall hypokinesis.
On postoperative day #3, the patient went for a STAT head CT scan without contrast due to her continued lethargy.
The CT scan showed a large area of hypoattenuation within the distribution of the right middle cerebral artery and the right posterior cerebral artery with foci of high attenuation in the region of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle that represented associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Neurosurgery was consulted upon evaluation of the CT scan for evaluation of the swelling and mass effect seen on CT scan.
Felt that there was not a need for any surgical intervention, and recommended serial CT scans.
At this time, the patient was noted on physical examination to not be following commands, was positive for doll's eyes.
Neurology consult recommended serial neurological examinations and serial CT scans.
It was also recommended to maintain patient's systolic blood pressure in the 140-160 range.
On postoperative day #4, patient's neurologic examination began to improve.
CT scan of the head showed no change.
It was noted that the patient had an elevated white blood cell count thought to be attributed to the steroids, however, the patient was pancultured and all cultures were negative for any infectious process.
Urinalysis from postoperative day #5 showed evidence of trace leukocyte esterase.
On postoperative day #8, the patient underwent a video fluoroscopic swallowing evaluation by the speech pathologist which showed overall mild oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced bolus control and formation with premature spill-over of liquids, oral residue and a mild delay in swallow initiation.
On postoperative day #11, the patient underwent a carotid ultrasound which showed no flow limiting stenosis in either the right or left carotid arteries.
A culture for Clostridium difficile was sent.
The Clostridium difficile culture subsequently came back negative and the Flagyl was stopped.
Patient underwent a CT scan of her abdomen to rule out intraabdominal process.
CT scan showed no evidence of pancreatitis.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature max 98.2, pulse 67, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 115/43, respiratory rate 15, oxygen saturation on 1 liter nasal cannula 95%.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 13.9, hematocrit 31.6, platelet count 419.
Urinalysis from [**8-17**] was negative.
Chemistries:  Sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 104, bicarb 25, BUN 9, creatinine 0.7, blood glucose 240, ALT 13, AST 34, alkaline phosphatase 60, amylase 101, total bilirubin 0.4, lipase 103.
Culture data:  Patient had a [**1-28**] blood cultures drawn on [**2102-8-14**] that was positive for coag-negative Staph.
The patient had a urine culture from [**8-14**] which showed Enterococcus species.
Patient has a chest x-ray pending, and the patient was cleared for discharge to rehabilitation.
