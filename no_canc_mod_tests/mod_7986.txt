STUDIES [**2189-6-5**]   Pathology Tissue: left lower lobe .
All these findings are better evaluated on a chest CT dated [**2189-1-8**] which suggest multifocal consolidation and bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis likely from infection.
[**2189-6-5**] INTERVAL CXR TECHNIQUE: Single upright portable chest view was read in comparison with the prior radiograph done on the same day five hours apart.
[**2189-6-6**] INTERVAL CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 82M w/hx of obstructive and restrictive lung disease, admitted after he developed hypoxia and tachycardia in the PACU after outpatient scheduled bronchoscopy, found to have LLL congestion.
HYPOXIA Pt underwent scheduled outpatient bronchoscopy and LLL lung biopsy for known pulmonary disease of unknown etiology documented on recent CT chest.
CXR showed LLL congestion (no pre-procedure CXR for comparison).
Multiple pending studies from the bronchoscopy (micro, path) to be followed-up by outpatient pulmonologist.
EKG not suggestive of acute cardiac issues.
