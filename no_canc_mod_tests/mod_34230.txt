Left supraclavicular fluid collection might be related to post-operative seroma.
CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2151-7-11**] 9:04 PM IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest read in conjunction with a chest CT scan, particularly frontal and lateral scout views on [**2151-6-22**].
Heavy aortic valvular calcifications not appreciated on the conventional radiographs, but clearly seen on the CT scan.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
ECG Study Date of [**2151-7-13**]  12:36:02 PM Baseline artifact.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-7-11**] the findings appear similar, although comparison of atrial rhythm and atrial morphology is difficult because of underlying artifact.
ECG Study Date of [**2151-7-11**]  9:58:58 PM Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-6-22**] no diagnostic interval change.
Routine nursing, ECG and CXR were done.
Her CT chest done- showed a new basal  L pleural effusion.
This was followed by serial CXRs, and a L CT was placed on [**2151-7-21**] that has drained 65 mls SS in the last 24 hrs.
The CT is placed anteriorly and is not draining the fluid present in the dependant postero basal part of the pleural cavity.
On [**2151-7-22**] CT showed LLL consolidation with mild to moderate element of pleural effusion.
