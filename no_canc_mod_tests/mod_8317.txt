PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs temperature 97.3.
Blood pressure 150/73.
Pulse 90.
Respiratory rate 16.
HEENT examination pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination regular rate and rhythm.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 12.8, differential pending.
Hematocrit 34.2, platelets 249, sodium 130, potassium 3.1, chloride 92, bicarb 25, BUN 12, creatinine .6, glucose 169, CK 562, urinalysis pending.
C spine x-ray right humerus x-ray, head CT negative by preliminary report.
Chest x-ray to be done.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 90, left ventricular hypertrophy with strain, no acute changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On further review of her x-ray the patient was noted to have right slightly displaced humeral fracture.
She was doing well until the evening of [**3-19**] when she vomited large amount of bilious emesis and became hypotensive to a systolic blood pressure of 70 and tachycardic to 140 and 150s, tachypneic and hypoxic with O2 sat in the 70s.
Arterial blood gas showed 7.41/29/56 on 100% nonbreather with a lactate of 5.4.
Electrocardiogram was with inferolateral ST depressions.
Chest x-ray was with a new large right large right lower lobe consolidation.
The patient initially improved to nasal cannula with intravenous fluids and oxygen, but then blood pressure again was tenuous and urine output decreased.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit she was aggressively hydrated for blood pressure and low urine output.
A CTA was done and was negative for pulmonary embolism/fat embolism.
Creatinine remained stable.
She was also transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on [**3-21**] for a hematocrit of 25.
Her emesis was thought to be secondary to pneumonia as well as to fecal compaction although there is no obstruction per KUB and her liver function tests on [**3-19**] were within normal limits.
Urine output decline was thought to be secondary to dehydration.
White blood cell count continued to rise to 21.4 on [**3-23**].
On [**3-23**] it was decided to start a morphine drip to titrate to comfortable respiratory rate of less then 20.
Laboratory draws and vital signs checks were discontinued.
