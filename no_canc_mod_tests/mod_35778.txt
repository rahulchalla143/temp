In [**Name (NI) **] pt found to have WBC 16, evidence of UTI in foley sample, LLL infiltrate on CXR.
Thought to be likely volume depleted, but given LE edema and CXR with possible upper lobe redistribution and left-sided pleural effusion.

He was hydrated gently overnight with some improvement in his blood pressure.
In the MICU the patient was given 3L of fluid with improvement in his blood pressures.
Thereafter, the patient had stable blood pressures, however he has required fluid bolusing to maintain urine output due to periods of decreased PO intake and overdiuresis.
2)Hypoxia:Pt cxr on admission consistent with pulmonary edema, as well as L sided pleural effusion.
As the patient's beta blocker was restarted, he had improved rate control with HR in the 70s-90s.
A cardiac echo was obtained to assess the patient's valve patency and ejection fraction.
This showed his mitral valve prosthesis to be functioning well, and that his EF is 40%.
As the patient's urosepsis resolved and his blood pressure improved, gentle diuresis was initiated.
OVer the next two days, however, the patient's CXR appeared to have a L sided effusion, thus a chest CT was obtained on [**5-5**] which confirmed the presence of a large L sided loculated pleural effusion.
7)Urinary tract infection: Pt urine culture grew two strains of pan-sensitive klebsiella.
His stool was guaiac negative and his hematocrit was stable, thus colonoscopy was deferred to the outpatient setting.
Followup Instructions: Pt will need an outpatient colonoscopy.
