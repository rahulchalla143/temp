Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT chest [**9-26**]: Interval increase in size of the dominant right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
The interval growth and CT morphology are highly suspicious for malignancy.
Other options include short-term followup CT in 3 months or VATS biopsy/resection.
Tiny lingular and left lower lobe nodules were previously obscured by atelectasis on the study of [**2118-5-12**].
[**2118-9-28**] CHEST XR (PORTABLE AP): There is vascular pedicles engorgement.
Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection.

Hypoxia: likely due to CHF with component of mild COPD exacerbation.
However they did consider that she might be at increased risk for coagulation as her recent CT findings were suspicious for malignancy.
Repeat CXR in the morning showed minimal change in pulmonary edema.
EKG unremarkable and cardiac enzymes were negative times 3.
TSH was checked given history of thyroiditis and was normal.
Could consider repeat stress testing although given severe debilitation and [**Hospital1 20440**] [**Hospital1 20441**], would need chemical stress.

You will need to have your creatinine checked this week on this medication along with your potassium since it can affect your kidney function.
