On [**5-20**], preliminary culture grew Gram negative rods.
The cultures subsequently grew Klebsiella.
Her abdominal CT scan at that time was negative.
Blood cultures drawn during that admission subsequently grew Enterococcus and the patient was given Vancomycin and Gentamycin.
Her blood pressure was low at home and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28678**] discontinued her Zestril and decreased her Verapamil back down to 180 mg from 360.
She went to Dr.[**Name (NI) 28679**] office for a transthoracic echocardiogram where vegetations were seen.

She returns now with mitral valve vegetations by transesophageal echocardiogram on the day of admission and a possible superior vena cava clot.
