Labs showed: AST 102, ALT 62, thrombocytopenia, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia, with tbili 7.7, Indirect bili 5.5, haptoglobin < 20 and hct 24-26.
She was diagnosed with cryptogenic cirrhosis and hemolytic anemia; outpatient workup by her PCP and hematology including negative Hep serologies, [**Doctor First Name **] <1:40, -ANCA, low C3/C4 and including negative cold agglutinins and negative combs test was unrevealing.
She underwent an outpatient BM biopsy was complicated by bleeding requiring a transfusion.
CT of her abdomen showed liver nodularity suggestive of cirrhosis.
Her INR was 2.0.

Recommend comparison with prior studies to evaluate for stability.
CT HEAD [**2193-5-11**] There is a 3.6 x 2.0-cm well circumscribed hyperdense focus at the superior aspect of the cerebellar vermis, above the fourth ventricle.
Prominence of the extra-axial CSF spaces is likely due to age-related involutional changes.
CT HEAD: [**2193-5-12**] The known hyperdense collection along the cerebellar vermis is unchanged compared to the initial CT from [**Month/Day/Year 13835**] 27 hours prior, measuring 3.7 x 2.1 cm.
On [**5-11**] she developed acute dysarthria; stat head CT showed acute hemorrhage at the superior aspect of the cerebellar vermis.
