Catheterization COMMENTS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided pressures (mean RA pressure was 12 mmHG, mean PCWP was 14 mmHG).
There was no evidence of pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure was 23 mmHg).
The cardiac index was normal at 2.9 L/min/m2.
Final angigoraphy demonstrated a small channel to the small distal vessels of the RCA and slow flow in the RCA.
Post-cath Echocardiogram Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF OVERVIEW:  34 yo M no cardiac risk factors with fam hx of anti-cardiolipin and distant cocaine hx presented with STEMI and 100% RCA occlusion that could not be opened on PTCA - per cath lab, suction cath was used to remove large amounts of fresh blood clot.
Telemetry showed a narrow complex tachycardia that often terminated with a pause and had some internal variability - it appeared consistent with regularized afib/aflutter.
In addition, he was started on amiodarone therapy after a baseline PA/Lateral CXR, TFT's, and LFT's were obtained as baseline.
The goal of amiodarone therapy was for short term rhythm control (2-3 months) to be followed by EP study with likely pulmonary vein isolation.
The patient was discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor with 2x daily monitoring plus event monitoring.
An echo was perfomed to assess his LV function and is discussed above.
Vessels: The patient was admitted with a STEMI and found to have a 100% RCA occlusion.
It was thought that the patient could have had thrombus secondary to hypercoaguability or malignancy - there was no evidence of either (of note, CXR was clear and testicular exam was normal).
ECG showed resolution of ST changes and pain resolved after the catheterization.
Urgent doppler study of the leg showed no clot nor comprimise.
It was never captured on 12 lead EKG and the patient was asymptomatic with the short spells (in contrast to his prior atrial fibrillation at the OSH where he described palpitations).
He was started on amiodarone therapy with the goal of a short course of therapy until and EP study could be done.
The hematology service was consulted and recommended a hypercoaguability workup focused on disorders that might be responsible for arterial thrombus formation.
In preparation for his follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient was scheduled for a cardiac MRI and a 24hr [**Last Name (STitle) **] as pre-ablation evaluation.
Clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): Take as directed to reduce blood clotting.
Coumadin 1 mg Tablet Sig: Five (5) Tablet PO at bedtime: Take as instructed and adjust as directed based on INR testing.
Toprol XL 100 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24HR Sig: One (1) Tablet Sustained Release 24HR PO once a day: Take as directed for heart protection and blood pressure control.
You will need to take blood thinners to try to prevent this from happening again.
You should follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8260**] next week for basic blood tests and exam.
You will need to have your blood drawn weekly for the next 1-2 months and [**Hospital1 **]-weekly thereafter to monitor your coumadin levels.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 7914**] number is: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9530**].
Before you see him you will need to have two tests: 1) 24 hour [**Hospital1 **] Monitor - this monitors your heart continuously for a 24 hour period.
2) Cardiac MRI - this will give a clear picture of your heart.
Will also need PT monitoring on coumadin.
[**Month (only) **] - [**12-30**] at 11am Cardiac MRI - before [**1-8**] - [**Doctor First Name **] notified - pt being scheduled.
