However, one night the patient desaturated to 86% oxygen saturation on room air and required nonrebreather mask to saturate at 100%.
A chest x-ray was done which showed a subtle diffuse reticular nodular pattern.
A chest x-ray was repeated which this time showed a rapidly progressive diffuse interstitial pattern.
The patient had a CT angiogram at that time to rule out a pulmonary embolus which was negative for pulmonary emboli but which showed ground-glass opacities and nodules throughout the lungs.
However, the patient had a repeat chest x-ray which showed a persistent reticular nodular pattern.
It was decided for the patient to have a high-resolution chest CT which showed worsening of the ground-glass opacities and nodular pattern bilaterally.
The patient was sent for bronchoscopy on [**9-16**] with bronchoalveolar lavage study.
Bronchoalveolar lavage studies were still pending.
Open lung biopsy was being contemplated, but as the patient was clinically improving (now satting 95% on room air and ambulating without desaturations) open lung biopsy will most likely not be done.
