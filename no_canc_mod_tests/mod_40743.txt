A CT Torso did not show any acute injuries.
CT Cspine did not show a definite fracture and her c-spine was cleared by ortho.

Urine Culture [**12-22**]: Pan-sensitive E. coli Urine Culture [**12-23**]: < 10,000 organisms Blood Cultures x 2 [**12-22**]: NGTD Blood Cultures x 2 [**12-24**]: NGTD .
Imaging/Studies: CT Torso [**12-22**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR Portable [**12-22**]: FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.
CXR Portable [**12-24**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**12-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Discharge: CK: 279 creatinine 1.1 INR 1.0 Hgb and hematocrit: 10.8/33 RPR neg  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F with hx of HTN, HLD, COPD (diagnosed by our CT scan), and likely severe baseline dementia transferred from OSH for concern of ACS after being found down.
Urine cultures grew pan-sensitive e. coli which cleared on repeat culture and blood cultures were NGTD.
She had STE's in the anteroseptal leads on his EKG in the ED which were stable from EKG's in [**2154**].
She also had LVH on EKG so her ST changes were thought to likely represent repolarization abnormality.
She had no events on tele, and a fairly unremarkable echo with LVEF of 45-50%.
# Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Kidney Injury: Pt was admitted with CK elevation to 1863 and Cr of 1.1 (baseline unclear but we expect something in the 0.7-0.8 range given her old age and size) after being down for possibly 18 hours.
Repeat CK was 279 and at time of discharge Cr had decreased to baseline.
# Pt will need frequent EKGs to monitor for QTc prolongation while she is on risperidone .
She will need daily weights monitored and if she puts on more than three pounds in one day or signs of fluid overload, should restart lasix  Medications on Admission: Meloxicam 7.5 mg daily Furosemide 60mg daily MVI Metoprolol succinate 25mg daily Aspirin 81mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
Stop meloxicam 3. start risperidone 0.25 tablet one tablet twice daily 4. start risperidone 0.25 tablet qHS PRN for delerium  Please follow-up with your PCP after discharge from your rehab.
