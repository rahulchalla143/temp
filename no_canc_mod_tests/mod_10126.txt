A CTA was negative for a PE, but an echocardiogram revealed severe mitral regurgitation with a flail posterior leaflet, dilated LV, and normal EF.
[**3-18**] HSM at apex Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS Ext: Warm, well-perfused, -edema, 2+pulses  Pertinent Results: Echo [**5-6**]: Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
She underwent usual pre-operative work-up and on [**5-6**] was brought to the operating room where she underwent a minimal invasive mitral valve replacement.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
