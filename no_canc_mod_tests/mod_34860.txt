Pt had an initial ph of 7.08, 20, po2 68.

She was noted to have a heart rate of 125 and a blood pressure of 97/60.
Her exam was notable for coarse but equal breath sounds and a distended abdomen.
They concluded that given the patient's down-trending LFT's and CT changes, these were not consistent with nec pancreatitis.
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt received zosyn, thiamine, Pt was admitted to the MICU for further evaluation and treatment.

Poor  R wave progression - cannot rule out old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2108-1-2**], biventricular systolic function is now improved.
[**2108-1-12**] CT ABD/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
# Pancreatitis: Nausea, vomiting, decreased PO, CT scan, and lipase of > 1000 demonstrate pancreatitis on admission.
There was no evidence of hemorrhage or pseudocyst on CT scan.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  TTE on [**1-2**] with LVEF 25%, with severe global hypokinesis.
[**1-10**] f/u TTE showed improvement in systolic function.
During her MICU stay, she continued to spike fevers and her antibiotics were broadened to Vancomycin and Zosyn IV.
She has no history of CAD but may have EtOH cardiomyopathy based on TTE done here.
No evidence cholecystitis, biliary tree abnormality on RUQ u/s x2 and CT torso.
