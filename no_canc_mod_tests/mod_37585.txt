His labs were notable for an INR of 2.5, HCT of 26.1 from recent baseline 29-30 in the beginning of [**Month (only) 547**].
His exam was notable for guaiac positive black stool in the rectal vault, and an NG lavage cleared with 800cc's of saline.
Hepatology was consulted and recommended reversal of his INR with 2 units of FFP.

LIVER U/S [**4-21**]: 1.
Hypoechoic lesion measuring 0.9 x 0.8 cm within the left lobe of the liver.
Given patient's history of cirrhosis, an MRI is recommended for further characterization of this lesion and to exclude malignancy.
CXR [**2117-4-22**]: Interval development of mild pulmonary edema with stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
CT Abdomen ([**2117-4-25**]): 1.
New small bilateral pleural effusions when compared to chest CT from [**2117-3-17**].
No lesion identified to correlate to that seen within the left lobe of the liver on prior ultrasound of [**2117-4-21**], but most likely represents a regenerative nodule.
Hct was 26.1 on admission and remained stable 25-26 after 1U PRBC.
There was no evidence of recurrent bleeding and on the day of d/c, INR was 2.1 and his HCT had remained stable.
Given patient's history of cirrhosis, an MRI was recommended for further characterization to exclude malignancy.
However, MRI could not be performed due to penile implant, and CT Abdomen was performed instead.
CT findings showed likely hemangioma, but lesion noted on ultrasound was not seen on CT, thought possibly due to a regenerative nodule.
INR  was reversed as above.
At the time of d/c his INR was 2.1; he was sent home on 1mg Warfarin daiily with instructions to have his INR checked [**4-29**] during his PCP f/u appointment.
Repeat CXR on this admission showed some increased pulmonary edema and was given lasix with improvement in his symptoms .
Transitional issues: -Pt needs close follow up of INR and Hct to ensure stability given recent bleed and known ulcers.
Calcium 500 500 mg calcium (1,250 mg) Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day.
You had an endoscopy, which showed ulcers in your esophagus and duodenum.
For this, you had a CT scan, which showed no evidence of cancer.
