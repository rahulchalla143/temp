HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular - The baby remained cardiovascularly stable throughout the hospitalization with apical pulses ranged 120 to 140 and blood pressure ranges systolic 60s to 70s/diastolics 30s to 40s, remaining consistently in the 40s to 50s range.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The baby has been fed ad lib breastfeeding and supplemented with Similac 20 calorie.
Gastroenterology/hematologic - The baby had a cord blood sent which revealed a bilirubin of 5.4, at six hours of age the bilirubin was 9.2.
5 when the bilirubin was noted to be 7.7, and phototherapy was decreased to double phototherapy at that time.

From a hematologic standpoint the baby's initial complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 18.9 with 64 polys and 0 bands, hematocrit of 35.7 percent, 384,000 platelets.
A reticulocyte count was noted to be 5.8 percent.
A repeat hematocrit following the second dose of intravenous immunoglobulin showed virtually no change with a hematocrit of 34.8 and a recheck of 9 percent at that time.
The last hematocrit was noted on [**10-5**], and the value at that time was 32.5 and a recheck at 8.4 percent.
