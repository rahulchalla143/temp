This infant was delivered at 38 weeks gestation to a 37-year- old gravida 3, para 1, now 2, woman with unremarkable past medical history, and the following prenatal screens: Blood group A negative, direct antibody test negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella-immune, group B Streptococcus negative.
The infant was vigorous at delivery, with Apgar scores of 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Birth weight 2980 gm (50th percentile), occipitofrontal circumference 34.5 cm (50th percentile).
Heart rate 110-120 respiratory rate 40-50, blood pressure 59/24 with a mean of 37 mmHg, temperature 96.6 degrees.
Examination reveals a well-appearing term infant in no distress.
The examination of the integument, as well as spine, limbs, hips and clavicles, is within normal limits.
A CBC and blood culture have been drawn; however, we will defer empirical antibiotic therapy in light of this clinically excellent appearance and absence of peripartum risk factors.
