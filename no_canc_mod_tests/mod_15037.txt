He was unresponsive at that accident site and presented to the Emergency Department with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Score of 3.
EEG was done and the patient was found to have no activity to noxious stimuli.
A liver laceration was noted with blood in the pelvis and the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy.
Of note, one plus Pseudomonas grew from sputum culture which was not treated and thought to be a colonizer.
On presentation, he was noted to have a temperature of 101.0 F., copious sputum production, and an arterial blood gas was done in the Emergency Department that showed pH 7.47, pCO2 37, pO2 50.
Due to the concerning arterial blood gas he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for suctioning purposes as well as stabilization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on transfer to the Medicine Floor are temperature of 100.0 F.; blood pressure 110 to 130/70s; heart rate 70; respiratory rate 20; oxygen saturation 100% on 40% O2 via tracheostomy.
On physical examination in general, the patient is not responsive to commands.
LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count 13.3, hematocrit 29.2, platelets 362.
Sodium 140, potassium 4.5, chloride 102, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.5, glucose 100.
PT 13.5, PTT 25.7, INR 1.3.
Urinalysis:  Trace leukocyte esterase, many bacteria, 25 white blood cells, less than one squamous epithelial cell.
Urine culture grew Enterococci pan sensitive.
AST 97, ALT 204, alkaline phosphatase 366, total bilirubin 1.0, amylase is 56, lipase 47, albumin 3.6, lactate 0.8.
Repeat urine culture [**2177-9-4**], showed no growth.
Sputum culture [**2177-8-31**], Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to Ciprofloxacin.
Blood cultures [**2177-8-30**], negative times four bottles.
Chest x-ray [**2177-8-30**], bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Head CT scan on [**2177-8-30**], right frontal encephalomalacia, multiple facial fractures, no abscess, no midline shift, no intracranial hemorrhage.
EEG [**2177-9-2**], moderate diffuse encephalopathy with background 6 to 7 Hz.
; per report, slight improvement compared to EEG done in Bermuda.
MRI of the brain / cervical spine [**2177-9-3**]:  Right frontal and temporal contusion and evidence of multiple areas of shear injuries.
CT scan of the right maxillofacial area [**2177-9-4**], multiple orbital fractures including the floor, compression of ethmoid cells.
NEUROLOGY:  The patient initially presented to outside hospital on [**2177-8-4**], with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Score of 3.
His EEG done at that point showed no activity even to noxious stimuli.
Intracranial pressures were as high as the 30s.
The Neurology Team was consulted and recommended a repeat EEG as well as an MRI of the brain and cervical spine.
Essentially, the EEG showed minimal improvement compared to report from Bermuda, however, no significant clinical improvement has been noted.
The MRI showed significant damage to the frontal and temporal lobes with destruction of the right ethmoid sinus.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 188**], he had a temperature spike to 101.0 F. with a white count of 16.
He was started empirically on Vancomycin and Levaquin and urine cultures grew enterococcus again.
Sputum cultures were also performed while in the Intensive Care Unit and showed growth of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient responded well to the antibiotics and his white count normalized, returning to 10,000 at time of discharge.
A repeat urine culture was performed [**2177-9-3**], and showed no growth.
ENT:  Given the extensive damage of the cribriform plate and right ethmoid sinus by MRI and CT scan, ENT was consulted for further treatment.
They recommended a dedicated maxillosinus CT scan which showed multiple fractures and mucocele in the left maxillary sinus.
Although the CT scan findings indicate that the patient is at increased risk of infection, ENT felt that there was no need for intervention at this time.
They recommended a Caring Evaluation to evaluate the extent of injury.
PULMONARY:  Due to the patient's thick secretions and low pO2 on arterial blood gas on admission he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
His oxygen saturations remained in the high 90s after transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient had a PEG tube placed at outside hospital on [**2177-8-28**], and has been receiving ProMod with fiber at goal of 80 cc an hour since then.
