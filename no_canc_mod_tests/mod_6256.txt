Pt recognized this syndrome as consistent with his prior anginal equivalent during his IMI in 04 and called EMS.
Pt then developped [**2173-6-10**] chest pressure while traveling in the ambulance and received 4 Aspirin.
VS on arrival to ED were HR 50, BP 51/37.
EKG showed inferior ST elevations and pt received Plavix 600mg, Heparin and Integrilin.
He received Atropine 0.5mg in the cath lab for HR in 60s.
Pt had significant improvement in chest pressure after completion of the cath.
EKG post procedure showed significant improvement in the inferior ST segments.
Physical Exam: VS: BP 155/97, HR 80, RR 14, O2 97% on RA Gen: WDWN middle aged male in NAD, resp or otherwise.

CARDIAC CATH [**2171-8-21**]: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed high systemic blood pressure with SBP of 152 mmHg, normal right and elevated left sided filling pressures with a PCWP of 19 mmHg.
The cardiac index was high at 8.57 l/mon/m2.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
TRANSTHORACIC ECHO [**2171-8-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CXR [**2171-8-22**]: Cardiac size is normal.
On cardiac cath, he was noted to have 40% in-stent restenosis but also distal subtotal occlusion in his RCA, requiring the placement of 3 BMS stents.
His echo showed mild basal/inferolateral hypokinesis with an LVEF of 45-50%.
HbA1c and nonfasting lipid panel were normal, and there is likely a strong genetic component.
Of note, it was determined that pt misread his ticlopidine prescription and had only been taking it once daily.
