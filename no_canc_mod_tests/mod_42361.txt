An oxygen saturation was noted to be 66%, with heart rate of 94, blood pressure 90/50, respiratory rate of 22.
A finger stick at that time was 183.
In the ED, his vital signs were initially blood pressure 135/71, heart rate of 90, and oxygen saturation of 88% on 15L NRB.
His initial ABG just after intubation was: 7.24, 88, 44, and shortly later was 7.32, 75, 250 on AC rate 12, PEEP 10.
Due to his unresponsiveness, a head CT was completed, which was negative for an acute process on preliminary read.
A chest x-ray was also completed which demonstrated right middle and lower lobe collapse versus infiltrate.
Review of systems is otherwise negative as obtained from family--no recent significant illness they were aware of.

CXR [**2102-2-17**]: Comparison made with prior study from [**2102-2-17**].
[**2102-2-3**]: CTA of chest IMPRESSIONS: 1.
CT abd without contrast [**2102-2-18**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Further evaluation may be obtained with ultrasound on a nonurgent basis as indicated.
EKG [**2102-2-17**]: Artifact is present.
CT head without contrast [**2102-2-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Echo [**2102-2-22**]: Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-2-3**], no definite change.
Further evaluation is limited by overlying bowel gas.
A bronch was done which showed purulent secretions in RUL w/ plugging and scattered secretions entire R side.
A CTA was also done was negative for PE but showed a right hilar consildation, bilateral pleural effusion.
On [**2-15**] he developed a PNA by CXR and he was treated for a HAP.
His sputum grew Klebsiella ESBL and he was started on meropenem and treated for a total of 8 days.
He was seen by cardiology and a repeat echo was done and they felt he was ready for trach.
A c-spine MRI was done to look for a possible lesion and was negative for cord compression but did demonstrate mild degenerative changes.
A head CT was negative for an acute process.
On [**2-28**] an EEG was done for concern of still having alterned mental status.
His urine was checked and was still positive for benzos and thus his AMS may be due to the versed still being removed from his system.
At one point he became bradycardic to the 50s with SBP in the 60s after his ET tube was adjusted.
BPH: His BPH medications were originally held given that his BP was on the low side and he had a foley in place.
# Renal insufficiency: His creatinine was elevated to 1.7 and his FeUrea was prerenal.
After several days his creatinine returned to the normal range.
Later during his admission he developed hematuria in with clots and a triple lumen was placed and CBI was initiated.
The patient will need f/u CT as outpatient in 6 months.
# Choledocholithiasis:  Patient's CT abdomen on [**2-18**] was noted to have Choledocholithiasis with numerous calcified stones within the distal common bile duct without any intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
# s/p NSTEMI:  He had an NSTEMI which was confirmed by his enzymes the day after he failed his second extubation.
Peak CK was 86 and troponin was 0.82.
Patient's Echo showed no regional WMA, had LVEF 50-55%.
He received ASA, statin, b-blocker initially and once his blood pressure better tolerated, his ACE-I was restarted.
