The pt was seen at an OSH and was found to have a collapsed right middle lobe by CT scan along with infiltrate.
Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She was kept on 5L NC to keep O2 sat > 94% and she was given a dose of ceftriaxone and azithromycin at the OSH.

Evaluation of the left ventricular outflow tract is limited due to position of the fetus.
She was continued on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community pneumonia coverage and was kept on supplemental O2 to keep her O2 sat > 94%.
Aggressive chest PT was performed and albuterol nebulizers were administered to help open airways.
Per ID recs, a repeat set of blood cultures were drawn, a sputum gram stain and culture, legionella urine antigen , and mycoplasma serologies were sent.
The legionella urinary antigen was negative and gram stain of the sputum showed no organisms.
Blood cultures from both [**2183-11-18**] and [**2183-11-20**] are still pending at the time of this dictation but have demonstrated no growth to date.
Given the pt's ongoing intermittent low-grade fevers as well as the serious nature of her pneumonia, she was counseled regarding staying in the hospital for another 1-2 days for further monitoring by both Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Doctor Last Name 13675**]) and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (Infectious Disease).
2) Fetal well-being:  Given the previable gestational age, the fetal heart tones were checked every day but no further interventions were performed.
The pt had reassuring fetal heart rate spot checks in the 140s-150s throughout her hospital course.
Evaluation of the left ventricular outflow tract was limited due to position of the fetus.
3) Thyroid nodule: On CT scan at the OSH, the pt was incidentally found to have a thyroid nodule in the left lobe.
She underwent a thyroid ultrasound at [**Hospital1 18**] which demonstrated that the left thyroid lobe was nearly entirely replaced by a solitary nodule measuring 3.8 x 3.6 x 3.4 cm.
TSH was checked and found to be wnl at 1.2, free T4 was slightly low at 0.8.
ceftriaxone 1g each day azithromax 250mg each day  Followup Instructions: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**12-1**] weeks Primary Care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1 week follow-up laboratory data and chest x-ray with primary care physician
