EKG on admission was unchanged from prior.
Of note, she received a repeat EKG during episode of abdominal pain (see below) which was significant for ST depressions TWI I/aVL which were possibly increased from baseline.
An ECG was obtained and as above was notable for mild ST changes as compared to prior, but it was thought this was rate related and there did not appear to be any cardiac signs or symptoms.
Cr trended down to 1.8 on discharge.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check hematocrit over the next 2 days to ensure stabilization given slow downtrend over admission.
You should have your hematocrit (blood count) followed for the next 2-3 days at rehab to ensure that it stabilizes  We also have set you up with follow up with the orthopedic surgeron.
