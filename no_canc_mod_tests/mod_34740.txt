However, she then underwent a abd CT scan with barium on [**2157-11-21**] and then began having diarrhea since then.
There she  had a repeat CT scan and RUQ showing common bile duct stones.
On exam in the ED, she was well appearing, mildly diffusely tender in her abd, initially tachycardic to 155.
Vitals: temp 100.1 Hr 95, Bp 110/50 19 97% 2L.
Strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities.

The intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts are dilated.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
Occlusion cholangiogram did not show any filling defects.
Consider evaluation for colits given diarrhea and thickening in the sigmoid colon on CT scan.
[**2157-12-3**] CT abd/pelvis with contrast: STUDY: CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
TECHNIQUE: Following the administration of intravenous contrast, MDCT axial images were acquired from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Tiny bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis are present at the lung bases.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A few diverticula of the sigmoid colon are present.
[**2157-12-1**] ERCP: Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal Major Papilla: Normal major papilla Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
Occlusion cholangiogram did not show any filling defects.
Consider evaluation for colits given diarrhea and thickening in the sigmoid colon on CT scan.
At the OSH she was febrile to 105 and CT scan there showed biliary dilation.
Here, her RUQ ultrasound also showed biliary dilation.
She underwent ERCP on [**2157-12-1**] which showed several large steons which were removed by no frank pus or other evidence of cholangitis.
OSH CT consistent with colitis, but also demonstrates choledocholithiasis.
Underwent ERCP (see below) and large stone removed, but no pus.
CT abd/pelvis with contrast performed at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed a long segment of lower sigmoid colonic wall irregularity and possible associated contained foci of extraluminal air and a few sigmoid colonic diverticula are noted.
Choledocholithiasis: ERCP on [**2157-12-1**]--sphincterotomy performed and 3 stones removed.
Given the patient's ventral hernia and prior abdominal surgery, the plan was for an outpatient elective open cholecystectomy.
Stool studies pending.
CT also demonstrates fecal-loaded colon--but given ongoing diarrhea, bowel regimen not started.
The patient needs a colonoscopy in [**5-8**] weeks.
