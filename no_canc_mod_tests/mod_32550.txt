Her ALT was 25, AST 189, AP 233 and ammonia 134.
Her INR was 2.0 and remained roughly stable throughout her stay.
She was treated intermittently with Levaquin and vancomycin for a suspected skin infection on her back; her WBC count fell to 13.7 and her skin improved.
The pt was also found to be in renal failure, with an initial SCr of 3, which then rose.
A CXR and repeat urine cx were performed.
The CXR was read as showing bilateral pneumonia, although the feeling of the transferring physician was that this was inconsistent with the patient's clinical picture.
By report, her SCr was at her baseline, 0.6, as recently as [**2115-2-1**].
