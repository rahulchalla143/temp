Pt was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 60244**] with elevated LFTs, rhabdomyolysis with CK 13,000 and weakness presumed secondary to a combination of zetia and avapro.
Muscle biopsy suggested a metabolic myopathy induced by toxic agents and drugs (i.e cholesterol lowering agents).
Course was complicated by contrast nephropathy and was temporarily on HD; creatinine on discharge was 1.0. .
ABG was 7.15/117/65.
ABG was 7.29/66/414.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-8-28**], the findings are similar.
The prominent RV cavity enlargement and free wall hypokinesis are similar and underestimated on the prior study and suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, bronchospasm, etc.).
Also, pt has RLL opacity on CXR which may be aspiration pneumonitis vs. early pneumonia.
His ABG improved from His ABG improved from 7.29/66/414 to 7.46/44/84 as him mentation improved.
Urine protein to creatinine ratio was 0.2 with a serum albumin of 3.8 - no evidence for nephrotic syndrome.
Echo showed worsened RV function.
