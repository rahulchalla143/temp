His hypotension was thought to reflect some RV involvement, but an ECHO showed normal RV function.
The ECHO also showed an EF of 50% and regional left ventricular basalar hypokinesis.
After one day, his blood pressure was stable, so he was called out to the floor.
He was started on IV heparin anticoagulation with a goal PT of 50-70.
His ECHO showed an EF of 50%, which is likely secondary to the acute MI.
