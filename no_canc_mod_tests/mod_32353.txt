NONCONTRAST CT HEAD: There are tiny foci of intracranial hemorrhage adjacent to the right thalamus.
There are multiple foci of hemorrhage within the ethmoid sinuses as well as air- fluid levels in the left maxillary sinus and right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Stable exam when compared with outside study demonstrating multiple facial fractures and scattered foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The outside studies were not available when I reviewed the [**Hospital1 18**] examination.
Radiology Report CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2156-8-7**] 4:56 AM  COMPARISON: Outside study performed [**2150-8-6**].
MAXILLOFACIAL CT SERIES NON-CONTRAST: Left temporomandibular clinoid fossa fracture, left zygomatic process fracture, left inferior and medial orbital wall blowout fractures, left inferior orbital rim fracture, left maxillary sinus, medial, and lateral wall fractures, left nasal fracture, right maxillary fractures are unchanged.
Radiology Report CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS Study Date of [**2156-8-10**] 11:38 AM   COMPARISON: CT head without contrast, [**2156-8-7**].
The fluid level in the left ethmoid sinus is unchanged from the prior study.
HEAD AND NECK CTA: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent with no evidence of stenosis.
Radiology Report CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2156-8-16**] 1:02 PM   CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Again seen are minimally displaced fractures involving the bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami.
Fluid attenuation within the left gluteus musculature is seen at the inferior and lateral aspect of the imaged field of view and represents hematoma, also seen on the previous CT examination.
His subarachnoid hemorrhage was small and did not require any intervention; it was recommended that if there was deterioration in his mental status that repeat head CT imaging would be indicated.
