Rib Films ([**2163-3-30**]) No fracture.
Echo ([**2163-3-24**])The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Head CT ([**2163-4-4**]) FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
BP of 90s systolic, FS 71.
Chest compressions were initiated.
Hypertension: The pt required IV labetalol for hypertensive urgency twice during her admission, however her BP stabilized as her overall status improved.
Obstructive cardiomyopathy: An echo performed during the pt's admission confirmed mild to moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Tight BP and heart rate control were maintained as best as possible.
Following her cardiac arrest, which included chest compressions, the patient developed more persistent central, non-radiating chest pain that was worse with movement.
It is thought that the pain is musculoskeletal in origin from the trauma sustained during the chest compressions.
Rib films were negative for fracture.
Her neuro exam was consistently non-focal.
A work-up for delirium, include two UAs, TSH, Folate, B12 and RPR testing was unrevealing.
A head CT was obtained on the day prior to discharge which showed small vessel ischemic changes but no acute findings.
***At the time of discharge, the pt's INR was elevated at 4.4, and thus her Coumadin was being held.
*** Close monitoring of the INR over the next few days is highly suggested.
Her blood sugar remained under good control.
You underwent CPR and were on a breathing machine for a short period.
