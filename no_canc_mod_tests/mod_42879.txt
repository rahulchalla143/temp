Patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed an aortic valve area of 1.25 cm sq, peak gradient of 57 ejection fraction of 66 percent, 40 percent left main disease, 80 percent LAD disease, 60 percent RCA disease, 70 percent PDA disease.
Echocardiogram showed 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic stenosis, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Patient went for an emergent CT scan which was negative for intracranial bleed.
Patient was loaded with Dilantin and patient was started on Neo-Synephrine which was titrated for a systolic blood pressure 130 to 140.
By neurologic examination by postoperative day number two patient was opening eyes to stimuli and was nodding her head to questions, spontaneously moving right side, right upper and right lower extremity, withdrawing her left leg to painful stimuli and no movement of her left upper extremity.
The patient's pacing wires were removed on postoperative day number two and patient underwent an MRI of the head.
The MRI showed significant white matter abnormality suggestive of edema accompanied by sulcal narrowing and gyral fullness in the right frontal lobe as well as seizure activity.
Neurology felt that this was suspicious for an old cerebrovascular accident and not indicative of a new ischemic event.
However, patient continued to require Neo-Synephrine to maintain systolic blood pressure greater than 115 which was the recommendation of the neurology team.
Patient continued on Kefzol, had a normal white blood cell count and by postoperative day number 11 patient had been weaned off her Neo-Synephrine with adequate systolic blood pressure and patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular part of the hospital.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Maximum temperature 99.2, pulse 74 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 118/60, respiratory rate 20, room air oxygen saturation 96 percent.
Patient's weight on [**5-5**] is 78.3.
Patient's dose should be adjusted based on daily PT/INR for a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
Postoperative seizures/ 6.
