Reason for MICU transfer: Critical tracheal stenosis   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy Rigid Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 39 yo WF with a hx of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG in [**7-10**] complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring IABP, LV systolic dysfunction (EF 35%), HTN, HLD, DM who presented with to an OSH 3 days ago with dyspnea and was intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Tissue culture grew out corynebactrium however BALs were negative.
Here, she had another rigid bronchoscopy that revealed tracheal stenosis with friable/necrotic tracheal mucosa obstructing ~80% of her tracheal lumen that was subsequently removed.

No CT evidence of tracheal perforation or mucosal tear (trachea above the tube is opacified with secretions and this section is not fully assessed) These findings are likely post-procedural.
However, correlation with physical exam and continued clinical monitoring is recommended.

Respiratory Failure: Presented to an OSH with dyspnea and was intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
rigid bronch was performed which revealed tracheal stenosis with friable tracheal mucosa for which she underwent cryotherapy and forceps removal of the necrotic-appearing respiratory mucosa; she ultimately underwent a tracheostomy with a long tube [**Last Name (un) 295**] (terminating ~2cm above the carina).
She was then able to be transitioned to the floor and continued to improve with regards to her oxygen requirement.
Tracheitis/Tracheal Stenosis(s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] long trach): The exact etiology is still unclear.
Final tracheal biopsy results were still pending.
It is hoped, however, with Speech evaluation at home and an appointment at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-2**] for follow up that with a few weeks of healing that the patient will be able to communicate via speech through a Passey Muir valve.
Pulmonary Edema: CT scan on admission showed diffuse ground glass opacities that were thought to be most likely pulmonary edema.
Studies still pending at the time of discharge: Final Tracheal Biopsy pathology #.
Please follow-up her blood pressure as she was started on lisinopril 2.5mg daily #.
