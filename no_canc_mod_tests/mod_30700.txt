Her emergency departement course was notable for elective intubation to allow patient to lay flat for CT scan.
The CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism, but showed congestive heart failure.
Family History: Father: CVA  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission to the MICU: Vital Signs: Afebrile HR 60 BP 80/30 gen: prior to intubation awake, though somnolent, easily arousable, oriented to person, placea nd following commands.
Extremities: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally neuro: before intubation, CN II-XII appeared intact, non-focal neuro exam, moving all extremities spontaneously  Pertinent Results: [**2110-10-10**] 06:47AM   GLUCOSE-141* UREA N-15 CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-146* POTASSIUM-4.1 CHLORIDE-100 TOTAL CO2-42* ANION GAP-8 [**2110-10-10**] 06:47AM   ALT(SGPT)-12 AST(SGOT)-28 LD(LDH)-170 CK(CPK)-252* ALK PHOS-94 AMYLASE-79 TOT BILI-1.1 [**2110-10-10**] 06:47AM   TSH-0.72 [**2110-10-10**] 06:47AM   calTIBC-350 VIT B12-596 FOLATE-18.8 FERRITIN-84 TRF-269 [**2110-10-10**] 06:47AM   ALBUMIN-3.4 CALCIUM-9.5 PHOSPHATE-3.5 MAGNESIUM-1.8 IRON-56 [**2110-10-10**] 06:47AM   cTropnT-0.02* [**2110-10-10**] 06:47AM   CK-MB-3 [**2110-10-10**] 12:45AM   CK(CPK)-249* [**2110-10-10**] 12:45AM   CK-MB-3 cTropnT-0.02* [**2110-10-9**] 02:25PM   CK(CPK)-148* [**2110-10-9**] 02:25PM   CK-MB-3 cTropnT-0.01 [**2110-10-9**] 02:25PM   PT-15.4* PTT-26.1 INR(PT)-1.5  Brief Hospital Course: Patient admitted to medicine service for diuresis.
Patient initially responded well to diuresis, but then further lasix held [**10-11**] to [**10-13**] due to metabolic alkalosis.
Bicarbonate increased to 44 ([**10-12**]), improving only slightly to 40 ([**10-14**]).
On [**10-14**], patient noted to be increasingly somnolent with decreasing systolic blood pressure in 90s.
ABG at that time showed 7.16/53/120/ 83% O2 , improved to 7.20/66/111/ 90% O2 with BiPAP.
CXR at this time showed worsened congestive heart failure with right greater than left pleural effusion.
An EKG obtained at this time showed sinus bradycarida with TWF in II, aVF, V6.
She was given atropine 1 mg x 3 with increase in HR to 60s but no improvement in blood pressure.
Respiratory Failure: Felt to be multifactorial secondary to CHF, OSA, pulmonary hypertension, possible pneumonia, and possible right diaphragmatic weakness.
The NIF score was negative 25.
She was scheduled to have a fluoroscopic SNIF on the day of discharge which they were unable perform due to her compromised respiratory status.
CVP ranged 12-14 suggesting euvolemia.
An echo was obtained which showed 3+ MR. 2+ TR, worsened oulmonary hypertension, as well as an echodense mass in left ventricle apex, likely thickened, calcified chordal structure.
Pt was seen by pulmonary who recommended no intervention at this time but follow up CT scan in 6 months when heart failure compensated.
