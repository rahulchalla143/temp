PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, physical examination showed a temperature of 96.8; heart rate of 72; blood pressure 145/66; respiratory rate of 18; saturation rate of 92% on room air.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count on admission was 12.9; hematocrit of 35; platelets of 407 with 86% neutrophils and 0 bands.
Chemistries were 137; 5.4; 96; 33; BUN 48; creatinine 1.5; glucose of 167; AST of 13; ALT of 21; alkaline phosphatase of 57; T bilirubin of .3; amylase 40; lipase of 20; lactate of 1.7.
PT was 13.1; PTT was 26.5 and INR was 1.1.
Urinalysis was negative.
CTA showed no abdominal aortic aneurysm, no free air around the gastric antrum.
Positive coronary artery disease with catheterization in [**11-20**] revealing occluded left anterior descending.
White blood count, as I said before was 12.9.
CT scan was as mentioned before; thickened antrum, free air along the gastrohepatic ligament and extravasation of contrast.
Postoperatively, the patient's vital signs were stable but the patient was in atrial fibrillation without apparent atrial fibrillation complications.
He had a fixed heart rate and was on low dose Neo.
However, he still looked good and passed a bedside swallowing evaluation on postoperative day number six.
CT scan with contrast was done on that day, showing fluid with air anterior to the gastric fundus and adjacent to the body of the stomach and thickening at the gastric remnant.
The patient's white count of postoperative day number 7 was 17.1 and continued to rise to 21.6 by postoperative day number 11 and 26.1 by postoperative day number 12.
An arterial blood gases was sent at that time showing blood gas of 7.45; 49; 151; 135 and 9.
Neurologic examination confirmed a left facial droop, almost flaccid left arm and upper motor neuron weakness in the left lower extremity.
There was also decreased sensation of temperature and light touch on the left arm and face.
The patient had a Stat magnetic resonance scan done and on [**2154-2-24**], after normal head CT, magnetic resonance scan showed no evidence of stroke.
Repeat magnetic resonance scan two days later also showed no evidence of stroke.
Carotid ultrasound and TTE were both performed.
Carotid ultrasound showed narrowing of less than 40%, bilateral internal carotid artery and TTE showing normal left atrium; normal left ventricle; apical left ventricular aneurysm; mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and focal akinesis of distal anterior and inferior walls; 1+ mitral regurgitation; mild thickening of atrioventricular valve and moderate PA; hypertension with an ejection fraction of 40%.
At the time of CT scan of the abdomen in prior hospital course, the patient had aspirated a minimal amount of gastrografin.
From [**2-24**], postoperative day number 12, recommendations were to consider to start on Unasyn and Fluconazole for yeast coverage, from abscess swab from operating room culture which showed 3+ PMN's, sparse yeast and gamma strep.
The patient had significant respiratory distress on [**2154-2-25**] and was transferred to the unit after having blood gas of 7.22, 86, 145, 37 and 4.
The patient was in the unit on postoperative day number 14 and three units of blood were given for a hematocrit of 23.5 at that time.
The patient was intubated in the unit and neurology continued to follow and to continue heparin with PTT goal of 40 to 60 for anticoagulation for clinical stroke, regardless of negative imaging and the goal SPP was 110 to 120 to increase perfusion.
EEG was not necessary.
On postoperative day number 16, the patient had a white count of 13.6 and was continued on anticoagulation, beta blockage, nebulizers and chest physical therapy and tube feeds were restarted.
