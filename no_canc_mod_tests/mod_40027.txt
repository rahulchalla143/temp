Retrograde access was obtained via the right common femoral artery for selective angiography of the subclavian, vertebral, and carotid arteries.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed central hypertension with opening blood pressures of 180/74 mmHg.
Angiography demonstrated a type 1 aortic arch.
Final angiography demonstrated a 20% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
The patient's blood pressures were extremely labile overnight, requiring both pressor support and intermittently labetolol drip.
