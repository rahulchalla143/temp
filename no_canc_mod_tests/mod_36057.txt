He reported [**8-2**] substernal chest pressure that radiated to his back, between shoulder blades, and bilateral arms.
He described the pain as a burning mid chest pain that started over a week ago, which he thought was heartburn.
In the ED, the patient was found to have BP 150s and HR in 120s.
ECG showed 4-5 mm STE in II/III/AVF, depressions in V2-V6.
Cardiac cath showed severe 3vd.
He was transferred to the CCU, clincally stable with BPs around 100. .
Physical Exam: VS: T 98 , BP 112/50, HR 66, RR 15 , O2 100% on 2LNC Gen: WDWN middle aged male in NAD, resp or otherwise.
Neck: Supple; difficult to determine JVP given pt was supine.

Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic pressures.
TTE [**12-10**] -  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
LV systolic function appears mildly-to-moderately depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior free wall and moderate hypokinesis of the posterior wall.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-12-10**], mild mitral regurgitation is now identified with normal valve mophology suggestive of papillary muscle dysfunction.
Regional left ventricular systolic function of the inferolateral wall is improved.
Port CXR [**12-13**] - In comparison with the study of [**12-12**], the patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration.
The cardiac borders and hemidiaphragms are well seen on this study.
Suboptimal imaging is noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo male with a history of AAA, HTN, and remote Tobacco use (quit in '[**49**]) who presented to the ED with chest pain, transferred to CCU after cardiac catheterization for inferior STEMI.
1) Cardiac Ischemia: The patient presented with a inferolateral STEMI and underwent emergenct cardiac catheterization that revealed severe 3-vessel disease as per the cath report with failed PCI of the tortuous, thrombus filled RCA.
As the cath was complicated by a small groin hematoma, heparin and integrillin drips were stopped.
His groin hematoma remained stable and Hct did not drop significantly.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled with a peak CK of 1521 and peak troponin of 2.74.
Unfortunately, on hospital day 3, the patient had a fever to 101.5 and his CABG was further postponed.
Blood and urine cultures were checked and were negative.
His temperature was thought to be secondary to post-infarct epicardial inflammatory changes and atelectasis.
Serial EKGs were not significant for evolving ischemic changes.
Pump: The patient remained euvolemic on exam during the hospital course.
A TTE was significant for a LVEF 40% with hypokinesis of inferior free wall and posterior wall, triv MR, and LVH.
A repeat TTE was significant for new onset mild mitral regurgitaiton that was consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction.
Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry and remained in NSR with occasional ectopy.
His UA was negative X 2, and all blood and urine cultures were no growth.
