His encephalopathy was thought to be baseline as well as due to dehydration.
A RUQ ultrasound revealed no portal vein thrombosis.
Hematocrit was stable at 30.
He also had a createnine of 2.1 (baseline 1.5) and a sodium of 124 (baseline 132).
His FeNa was < 1%, so this was likely pre-renal.
His BP was 60/palp and HR was 110.
He was helped back to bed and his HR and BP returned to [**Location 213**] (SBP 100, HR 90).
His CMV viral load was negative.
His Hct was 22, so he was transfused 2 units RBCs for [**Location **] loss anemia.
His INR was 3.0, so he was transfused 3 units of FFP to correct his coagulopathy.
A CT scan revealed a right-side retroperitoneal hematoma.
Over the night, his Hct dropped to 15, then rose to 18, then 25, then 27.
His INR went from 3.3 to 2.8 to 2.5 to 0.6.
On HD 7, his Hct dropped from 28 to 11 over 3 hours.
The goal was to transfuse [**First Name3 (LF) **] products to keep Hct > 27, Plt > 75, and INR < 2.0.
