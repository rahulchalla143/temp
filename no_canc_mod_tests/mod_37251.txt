Stress test showed reversible ischemia (anterior and inferior walls).
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: # severe native 3vd, patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, 90% [**Hospital3 **] ostial lesion, diffusely diseased RCA with 85% lesion and patent SVG-RPDA.
Physical Exam: VS: t 97.9, BP 155/80, HR 20 sat 100% on 2L GENERAL:NAD.
SKIN: +stasis dermatitis, +L.foot 2nd and 3rd toe arterial ulcers, PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ trace DP PT trace+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ trace DP PT trace+  Pertinent Results: CXR (portable AP) [**2117-1-15**]: No evidence of pneumonia.
CT head w/o contrast [**2117-1-15**]: Limited CT due to patient motion; however, no acute pathology identified.
If clinical concern for ischemia persists, an MRI with DWI is more sensitive.
ECHO [**2117-1-27**] - Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-1-14**], biventricular systolic function is more depressed and the severity of mitral regurgitation (previously minimal on review) is increased.
The patient's EKG showed ST elevations in V1-V2 with an new LBBB; the patient cath images and EKGs were again reviewed and cath was not felt to be an option.
# PVD/gangrene: Patient with bilateral peripheral vascular disease who was admitted with with dry gangrene of left 2nd and 3rd toes.
