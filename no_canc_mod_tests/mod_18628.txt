A clot extebds within the [**Last Name (un) 71228**] of right lateral ventricle.
Air- fluid levels within the right maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are consistent with intubation.
Repeat CT scan at [**Hospital1 **] shows impending herniation through the foramen magnum, and enlargement of hemorrhage.
She presented with BP in 250s systolic and HR in 50s upon arrival, not overbreathing the vent - suggestive of [**Location (un) 3484**] triad.
Within 1 hr of arrival, she has dropped BP in response to nipride gtt, to 60s systolic.
Received mannitol 50 g now, then 25g q6h, monitoring osms and Na q6h.
Loaded with Dilantin 1000mg (for approx 50kg female) slowly, to prevent risk of dropping BP further and cardiac arrhythmia, then started 100mg q8h.
