She described substernal chest pain and tightness that was acute in onset and felt similar to her prior MI, but not as severe.
On arrival to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], initial vital signs were: T:98.6 HR:90 BP:83/51 RR:20 O2sat:97% RA.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were: T:97.3 P:80 B:92/53 (on 10 dopa) R:16 O2sat:97% RA.
She had new TWIs in V2-V4 (similar to when she had an NSTEMI in [**2108**]).
Her chest x-ray was clear, she had no LE edema, and was not hypoxic.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Also had abd CT negative, Chest CT demonstrated LUL nodule which was monitered.
Had recent scan that demonstrated increase in size of LUL nodule from 3mm->7mm, PET scan in [**12-11**] negative - scheduled to have repeat Chest CT this month.

Her lisinopril, furosemide, and metoprolol were all held.
Bedside echo showed no interval worsening of EF.
Interestingly, the MICU team noted that her pressure with invasive montitoring via a-line was consistently [**10-21**] points higher than with a peripheral cuff.
Her blood pressure stabilized to the 90s systolic without dopamine and she was transferred to the floor.
Given recent weight loss, there was concern that poor nutritional status was resulting in a decreased oncotic pressure in the vasculature, but albumin was 3.7.
Negative cardiac enzymes x 3.
# CAD - NSTEMI in [**2108**] and STEMI in 09/[**2112**].
After her blood pressure stabilized in the MICU, she was re-started on metoprolol, but her BPs were intermittently in the 80s, so metoprolol was discontinued again.
# Acute kidney injury: Her baseline creatinine is 0.4-0.5, but was up to 1.1 on arrival likely from volume depletion.
Her creatinine trended down to 0.5 following fluid resusitation.
You got IV fluids and a medicine to help increase your blood pressure.
We are concerned that part of the reson your pressure was low was that you have not been eating and drinking enough at home.
We have made the following changes to your medications: - Please STOP taking metoprolol XL 12.5 mg daily.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
Followup Instructions: Please keep the appointment with your cardiologist and for an echocardiogram on Thursday at [**Hospital3 **].
