Of note, his CT head was negative.
His EKG showed diffuse ST segment depression that could either be consistent with global hypoperfusion secondary to his arrest or to left main disease.
His cardiac enzymes were positive secondary to demand and to his low blood pressure.
His echocardiogram was negative for tamponade and showed an EF of >55%.
His cholesterol panel was at goal with an LDL of 63, so the statin was discontinued.
Per outside records, he had a stress echo in [**2116**] which showed no evidence of ischemia or diliation.
The hypercapnea resolved but he remained hypoxic, likely from his pneumonia.
His CTA was negative for a pulmonary embolism.
He had  high white cell count (12) at admission that increased once he was placed on steroid.
