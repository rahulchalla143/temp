A head CT per report was concerning MCA infarct on the right side with uncal herniation and he was intubated for airway protection with succ./propofol/vecuronium.
On arrival he was sedated and paralyzed, and blood sugar was ~400.
Head Ct was reviewed with showed a large right frontotemporal parietal mass with vasogenic edema and midline shift of 1cm.
Neurology was consulted and was given 1 g/kg of mannitol, hyperventilate and repeat scan was recommended.

MRI Brain IMPRESSION: Rim-enhancing lesions in the right periventricular region adjacent to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle and right parietal subcortical region as well as subtle signal abnormality and enhancement in the right thalamus.
[**2129-7-14**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Extensive vasogenic edema throughout the right hemisphere is again seen, without change since prior study.
Masses seen on prior MRI are not well visualized by CT. Midline shift is unchanged compared to prior study.
[**2129-7-14**]: CT Torso: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT torso demonstrated no evidence of malignancy.
On [**7-17**] a successfull LP was obtained and CSF was sent out for numerous infectious examinations.
He was on paralytics but he had no pupillary response and then his exam remained poor when off sedation.
Post-op imaging showed significant cerrebral edema.
He had a perfusion study on [**7-18**] and results were available on [**7-19**] showing brain death.
