CXR showed diffuse puffy infiltrate b/l most consistent with ARDS.
On bronchoscopy, blood was visualized, consistent with pulmonary hemorrhage.
Her INR was supratherapeutic on admission and warfarin was discontinued indefinitely.
Workup for vasculitis including ANCA and anti-GBM were negative.
Her hematocrit remained stable for the rest of her hospitalization.
She underwent an echo, which was essentially unchanged from prior.
She was treated as above for pneumonia, and her fever curve was trended.
