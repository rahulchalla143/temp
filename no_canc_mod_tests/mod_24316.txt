A CT scan was ordered which revealed a 4.8 cm thoracic aortic aneurysm.
PET CT showed multiple bilateral FDG avid nodules.
In the interim, a pANCA level came back positive, along with an ESR of 115 and a newly discovered anemia of 8.0, and she was seen by Rheumatology, who facilitated elective admission to the hospital for further workup.
She was admitted to MICU for monitoring in setting of blood loss, CXR appearance showing diffuse opacities, and concern for hemoptysis.
She was transfused two unit pRBC on [**6-5**] & [**6-7**] for decreasing HCT 21.1.

Brief Hospital Course: 66yo woman with a h/o HTN, CAD s/p CABG and mechanical [**Hospital3 9642**] bileaflet aortic valve placed 20 years ago on coumadin, presented with hemoptysis, lung nodules, microscopic hematuria with positive P-ANCA, elevated ESR, CRP.
Renal biopsy showed necrotizing extracapillary (crescentic) glomerulonephritis, pauci-immune type consistent with glomerulonephritis of the ANCA-associated vasculitic syndrome.
# Hemoptysis/Microscopic hematuria: Patient presented with hemoptysis,lung nodules with +pANCA with working diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis/Microscopic Polyangiitis and admission was facilitated by outpatient rhuematology for INR reversal and lung biopsy.
She had CT chest consistent with widespread hemorrhage thought to be secondary to Wegener's granulomatosis or other vasculitis given concurrent renal insufficiency and active urinary sediments.
Following discussions with renal, IP, thoracics, and rheumatology, it was decided to proceed with a biospy of the lung.
Her coumadin was held before lung biopsy and she was given vitamin K to speed INR reversal.
Lung biopsy results were non-diagnostic.
She then had a renal biopsy on [**2165-6-11**] which confirmed diagnosis of ANCA associated vasculitis.
Throughout the later half of her hospital course she continued to have hematuria on urine studies but no gross hematuria appreciated.
# [**Last Name (un) **]/Microscopic hematuria: On UA patient had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria with active sediments with a large amount of WBC and RBC and fat bodies.
Renal biopsy showed necrotizing extracapillary (crescentic) glomerulonephritis ,pauci-immune type consistent with glomerulonephritis of the ANCA-associated vasculitic syndromes.
There was a maximum increase to Cr 1.5 during mid-[**Month (only) 205**] with potential pre-renal and intrinsic kidney damage to blame in the setting of known blood loss issues at that time.
Thus, this confirmed most of her kidney dysfunction could be blamed on ANCA vasculitis.
# Perinephric and retroperitoneal bleeds: Two days after renal biopsy patient was started on heparin bridge to coumadin.
7 days later, while waiting for the INR to become therapuetic she developed severe abdmominal pain with CT scan showing perinephric and subcapsular hematoma.
Her hematocrit intially dropped but then became stable after one unit of tranfusion.
After her hematocrit was stable for several days, she was restarted on heparin on [**6-30**].
On [**7-2**] she was restarted on coumadin since her hematocrit had remained stable.
She remained stable while on the floor with hematocrits ranging from 24-26.
She had a brief hematocrit drop on [**2165-7-11**] to 22.8, for which she was transfused an additional unit of blood and subsequently had a CT abdomen and pelvis which revealed no new bleeding source and stability of her perinephric bleed.
Her hematocrit on discharge on [**2165-7-13**] was 26.2.
Throughout her nearly 6 week hospital course, Ms. [**Known lastname 88713**] received a total of 18 blood transfusions.
After realizing active intra-abdominal/RP bleeding with dropping HCTs she also had her anticoagulation held in the ICU setting later in her hospital course.
Heparin was briefly stopped given a small hematocrit drop on [**7-6**] while INR was 1.8, but soon thereafter it was restarted with Coumadin.
She was discharged on Coumadin dose of 4 mg/day and with an INR of 2.3.
Close follow-up arranged with VNA and PCP for ongoing INR checks and HCT monitoring.
Her reticulocyte was 1.3 on [**6-19**] possibly from bone marrow suppresion most likely from new meds e.g Cytoxan and Bactrim.
Patient's iron studies as well as B12, and folate as well as hemolysis labs were normal.
10 days after the renal biopsy patient developed a retropertotenial bleed further contributing to her anemia.
Her Hct on discharge was 26.2.
Plan at discharge was for VNA and PCP to help check her Hct within a few days of discharge to make sure it continued to remain stable.
RUQ Ultrasound did not show any biliary dilation.
# Leukopenia:  WBC trended down to 1.5 on [**2165-6-21**].
All blood and urine cultures during hospital course were unremarkable.
Her WBC count returned to [**Location 213**] without any intervention by [**6-28**], and remained normal throughout the rest of her hospitalization.
# HTN: Blood pressure was initially on the low side and her captopril, lasix, spironolactone were held in the setting of low BP and RP/perinephric bleeding issues.
Several days after her active bleed seemed to have stabilized in the ICU she had blood pressures adjusted again to include labetolol, TID captopril and amlodipine in order to ensure elevated blood pressures did not set off additional bleeding.
Patient will follow up with her nephrologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 118**] for her next planned  IV Cytoxan therapy over the next few weeks  Patient will have her INR monitored as outpatient by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

You were directly admitted to the ICU where your symptoms and blood levels were closely monitored.
You had a lung biopsy on [**6-7**] which was without clear diagnosis.
Therefore, at the recommendations of our rheumatology and renal teams, you underwent a kidney biopsy on [**6-11**] which demonstrated inflammatory changes in your kidneys consistent with ANCA-associated vasculitis.
You were kept in the hospital to continue monitoring of your blood levels while waiting for your INR level to reach a therapeutic level.
Unfortunately, your red blood cell levels (Hematocrit) decreased significantly due to a bleed around your kidneys which occurred after the renal biopsy.
This bleeding was in your abdomen and pelvic area (retroperitoneal space) and it was monitored on both abdominal ultrasounds and CT scans.
At that time, your red blood cell counts and INR had stabilized to appropriate levels.
We also set up an appointment with your cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4597**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5017**] for Wednesday, [**7-17**], who will be continuing to help manage your anti-coagulation therapy and INR test results now that you have a history of a significant bleed.
