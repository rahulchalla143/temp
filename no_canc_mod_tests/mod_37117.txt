Of note, the pt has been receiving his vancomycin at hemodialysis, with pre-dosing levels of approximately [**8-14**].
He had a set of surveillance blood cultures drawn last week, which were negative.

[**2187-12-22**] BCx x 2-NGTD [**2187-12-14**] BCx- NGTD   Brief Hospital Course: 1.
Epidural abscess/osteomyelitis- On admission pt had a known L4-L5 epidural abscess diagnosed by MRI 1 month previously, which did not grow any organisms on culture but was presumably a consequence of recent E. coli sepsis.
He had already received 4 weeks IV antibiotics including vancomycin and Levaquin, with a set of blood cultures the prior week that were negative.
MRI of L-spine on admission demonstrated extension of L4-L5 inflammation with L4 collapse.
We consulted Neurosurgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] to assess the need for surgical treatment, and the pt underwent L4-L5 spinal fusion with disc biopsy on [**2187-12-21**].
The surgery went well with no procedural complications; intraoperative wound culture was negative, which is consistent with suppression of infection by continuing antibiotics.
He will also require follow-up in [**Hospital **] clinic as scheduled, with repeat MRI 3-5 days prior to follow-up.
Last vancomycin dose was [**2187-12-27**] at HD as levels have been high.
We stopped the long-acting opioids initially and used morphine for analgesia.
HTN- BP was sub-optimally controlled on admission.
Post-operative hypotension- After his surgery, the pt developed hypotension while in the PACU to 80s systolic, along with tachycardia and agitation.
His hypotension was most likely [**2-5**] volume depletion, as he had been taking poor PO fluids and had been NPO before surgery, with large open surgical wound during procedure.
Another possible etiology included sepsis, though blood cultures were persistently negative and the pt was never febrile.
HCT was acceptable at 42 on admission.
At d/c, there are no symptoms or clinical sequelae of anemia and Hct 33.6 on discharge.
He was followed by the Renal team during his admission, and received HD on his usual schedule during his stay, with no complications.
