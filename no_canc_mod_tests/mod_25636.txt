CT Brain Perfusion & CTA Head w/ & w/o Contrast ([**2131-8-30**]): FINDINGS: NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures.
Mildly prominent ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are noted, related to volume loss.
CT CEREBRAL PERFUSION STUDY: The present study does not include the middle cranial fossa structures completely.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD AND NECK: The origins of the arch vessels are patent.
Evaluation of the proximal cervical internal carotid artery is limited due to dental artifacts.
Evaluation of the proximal cervical internal carotid artery limited due to artifacts.
Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] soon after the study in the morning on [**2131-8-30**] at approximately 9:10 a.m. .
Urine Osms were notable for inappropriate concentration, presence of inappropriate Na, which would argue more for SIADH than a hypovolemic picture.
We held fluoxetine on discharge and recommended fluid restriction (1500cc/day) as well as follow-up with PCP for further evaluation and repeat CXR.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - SIADH remains of unclear etiology - should be worked up with CXR PA/Lateral as outpatient - Advance diet with fluid restriction - pt was discharged home with 1500cc fluid restriction - Discuss what to do with fluoxetine with outpatient PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was full code on this admission  Medications on Admission: Fluoxetine 20 mg Daily Docusate sodium 200 mg daily Calcium 600 + D, 2 tabs daily Ciclopirox 0.77% topical cream daily Fluocinide 0.05% PRN topical cream Glucosamine, Chondroitin 1500/1000 mg 2 AM, 1 PMj Daily mult A,C,E Aspirin 81 mg daily Fish oil 1200 mg daily Previoent 5000 + 1.1 sodium fluoride tooth paste  Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

We performed a number of laboratory blood tests and found that you had a very low level of sodium in your blood.
Because your baseline sodium levels are on the low side, we recommend further evaluation with your primary care physician for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] possible cause.
This is equivalent to 5 small cups or 4 cans of diet coke or 3 regular sized water bottles.
You should have further work-up for the cause of your low sodium, including a chest xray.
