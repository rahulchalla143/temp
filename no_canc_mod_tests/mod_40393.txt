Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD on 3L home oxygen therapy, OSA, unknown type of CHF, OSA, cor pulmonale, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hypercarbic respiratory distress.
He received azithromycin in the ED and was broadened to levaquin, vancomycin, and cefepime in the ICU when chest X-Ray showed evidence of possible pneumonia, though this was narrowed back to levaquin given his rapid  clinical improvement.
His oxygen saturations remained in the mid-90s on his home dose supplemental 02 at 3LNC.
He worked with physical therapy, and maintained saturations in the low 90s on 6LNC (also his home dose).
ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE:  His admission CXR showed evidence of mild pulmonary congestion.
As his oxygen saturations rebounded on the medicine floor, he was placed back on his oral home-dose lasix.
HYPOTENSION:  he had asymptomatic hypotension to SBP 80 during the day prior to discharge.
Pressures rebounded when lisinopril was discontinued when his systolic dysfunction was found to be preserved.
