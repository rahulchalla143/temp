Vitals were recorded as t 98.1, bp 140/80, hr 116, rr 20, and o2 sat 95% on ra  She was observed to pull herself up into an upright position independently.
At [**Hospital1 46**], a non-contrast CT of the head was thought to show evidence of hemorrhage.
Therefore, vitamin K (and possibly FFP by some reports) was administered to reverse the INR.
She was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care with a presumed diagnosis of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.
Of note, no acute hemorrhage was detected upon repeat imaging performed at the [**Hospital1 18**].

CT Cspine [**4-14**]:  IMPRESSION:  1.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT torso (obtained at OSH):  IMPRESSION:  1.
CXR [**4-15**];  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-14**], the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed.
Studies in the ED revealed urinary tract infection (which could potentially account for the patient's presenting syndrome) as well as a CT showing chronic to subacute strokes w/ suspected hemorrhage being consistent w/ a calcification.
Underwent repeat CT w/o any changes.
K and FFP at OSH and has afib, she was started on heparin gtt bridge to coumadin.
Examination remained severely encephalopathic with a poor motor examination (withdrawal to noxious that was sluggish) due to having had received over 7mg of Ativan, etomidate, succinyl choline and vecuronium.
Motor exam was notable for sign.
On [**2111-4-16**], urine culture was positive for Vancomycin Resistant Enteroccus (VRE).
Bedside echo revealed poor filling.
After starting amiodarone, her INR elevated up to a max 3.7.
Her INR on [**4-20**] was 3.7.
Her INR should be checked daily.
The plan regarding her INR is that once INR is < or = to 3.2, coumadin can be restarted.
There was evidence of b/l pleural effusions on CXR attributed to vol.
CT chest showed multiple pulmonary nodules (see Pertinent results) that will require imaging follow up on [**4-18**] months with CT.  .
Coumadin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: ***NOTE: This should be started once INR is less than or equal to 3.2.
Please check INR daily.
Studies in the ED revealed urinary tract infection (which could potentially account for the patient's presenting syndrome) as well as a CT showing chronic to subacute strokes w/ suspected hemorrhage being consistent w/ a calcification.
1) Urine culture was positive for vancomyicn resistant enterococcus.
However, her INR has been elevated up to 3.7 on [**2111-4-20**].
Her INR should be checked daily.
Once INR is less than or equal to 3.2, coumadin should be resumed at 2.5 mg daily.
