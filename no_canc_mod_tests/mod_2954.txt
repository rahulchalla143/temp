Brief Hospital Course: He was found to be hypotensive (79/57) and bradycardic (46) on initial evaluation, but responded well to fluid resuscitation in the ED and was admitted to MICU for further evaluation.
No clear etiology was found for the patient's nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but they resolved during the hospitalization.
His symptoms could have been [**3-2**] uremia, especially if recent dialysis had been ineffectual in setting of poor fistula function.
On routine CXR during the patient's ICU admission, he was found to have a RLL opacification which was felt to be worrisome for neoplasm with interval progression in comparison to a prior CXR.
We instructed the patient to follow up with his primary care physician promptly, at which time a CT chest should be obtained if the primary care physician deems it necessary.
You were found to have low blood pressure when you came to the hospital and required fluids to bring your blood pressure back up to normal.
