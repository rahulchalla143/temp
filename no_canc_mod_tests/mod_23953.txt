It started off 5 weeks ago with a right facial palsy, which his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 10851**] in NH thought was a Bells palsy.
On [**8-23**], his PCP ordered an MRI of the brain which showed a 1.5 cm soft tissue mass in the midbrain and a question of a small acute infarct in the right posterior part of the pons.
Last week on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] took his father to CMC [**Location (un) 5450**] [**Name (NI) **], and he had a CT scan of his brain which he was told showed nothing, and the MRI of his entire spine w/o contrast showed a questionable lesion (probable hemangioma) at T7, otherwise there was a minor disc protrusion at T9/10.
At [**Hospital1 189**] he had a CXR which showed atelectasis of the R middle lobe which could be due to a lesion or infection, and his CT head scan had a lot of movement artifact.

Further evaluation with endoscopy may be considered.
MRI Brain ([**2102-9-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Right Shoulder X-ray ([**2102-10-1**]): No fracture, dislocation, or gross degenerative change is identified.
CXR ([**2102-9-28**]): ET tube tip is 3.2 cm above the carina.
CXR ([**2102-9-28**]): FINDINGS: The patient is post extubation.
CXR ([**2102-10-1**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-30**], there is some decrease in the degree of left lower lobe atelectasis.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram ([**2102-9-29**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
MRI brain was ordered with demonstated a possible pontine acute infarct and midbrain mass.
There was concern for pneumonia based on CXR, however the patient had a BAL and sputum cultures which were both negative for any growth.
The patient was afebrile without elevation in WBC count without treatment.
All blood, sputum and urine cultures were negative.
He had a PEG tube lavage which was negative for any upper GI bleeding source.
His hematocrit remained stable.
He was also seen by gastroenterology who did not perform either an EGD or colonoscopy as his bleeding had resolved.
His LFTs, amylase and lipase were all normal.
He had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which was normal.
His KUB showed a significant amount of stool, so constipation was thought to be the major source of his pain.
His medications were also spaced out so that his lopressor was not given with his seroquel, which also resolved his hypotension.
