Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal systemic arterial pressures of 138/76 mmHg.
Left and right sided filling pressures were normal, with LVEDP of 12 mmHg, mean PCW of 9 mmHg, RVEDP 10 mmHg.
Calculated cardiac index was 2.6 l/min/m2.
Left ventriculogram demonstrated no significant mitral or aortic regurgitation.
[**2118-9-5**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound No stenosis of the carotid arteries bilaterally.
[**2118-9-6**] ECHO PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed severe multi-vessel disease.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed mild symmetric LVH with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function and mild prolapse of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with trivial mitral regurgitation.
On postoperative day two, she was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
INR was 1.3 on discharge.
