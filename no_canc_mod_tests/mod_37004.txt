EMS reports BP 240/110, HR 72, and O2sat 100% on NRB, with labored breathing.
EKG with no evidence of ischemia.
His BP improved to 175/101.
He was taken for L and R heart cath to evaluate his grafts.
R heart cath showed PCWP of 31.

Cardiac Cath [**2106-12-23**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Right renal artery angiography demonstrated 60% lesion that did not have significant gradient with vasodilator therapy.
The right sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 9mmHg and RVEDP was 14mmHg).
The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean PCW pressure was 31mmHg and LVEDP was 36mmHg).
The systemic arterial  pressures were significant elevated measuring 198/86mmHg.
Head CT [**2105-12-24**]: FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
Note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive.
Correlation with CT angiography is recommended for further evaluation.
Was initially treated with nitro drip, but now on all oral medications (added clonidine 0.2 [**Hospital1 **], imdur 30mgQD, norvasc 10mg QD) and controlled to 100-130 systolic.
He had headaches associated with high blood pressures (above 160 systolic), with nausea and vomiting that resolved with control of BP.
Head CT was negative for acute process, but showed linear opacification thought to be MCA atherosclerosis, confirmed by MRA.
We simplified BP management with Enalopril 40mg QD, Imdur 30 QD, Toprolol XL 75mg QHS, lasix 40mg QD, Amlodipine 10mg QHS.
# CHF: H/o both systolic and diastolic dysfunction with EF 30-35%, likely ischemic cardiomyopathy.
He ruled out for MI with no EKG changes to suggest new ischemic event, 3 sets cardiac enzymes with flat CKs and troponin very mildly elevated.
EKG with no evidence of acute ischemia.
Did have several small runs of NSVT and in combination with low EF he should have outpatient follow-up with repeat echo in 6 weeks for risk stratification for ICD placement.
Thought to be embolic showers likely secondary to cardiac cath on the [**12-23**].
