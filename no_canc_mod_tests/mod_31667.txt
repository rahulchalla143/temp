CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW [**2119-7-2**]: The heart is not enlarged.
ECG [**2119-7-2**]: Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2119-7-3**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2112-3-23**], regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2119-7-5**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared to the study dated [**2119-7-3**] (images reviewed), the patient is more tachycardic.
Pulmonary pressures are now in the moderate range (undetermined on the prior study).
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST [**2119-7-8**]: Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
MICROBIOLOGY:  URINE CULTURE [**2119-7-2**] _________________________________________________________                              ENTEROCOCCUS SP.
#NSTEMI -  Initial troponin T was 0.90 and peak was 2.27.
EKG showed STD in V3-V5 consistnt with anterior septal MI.
Repeat EKG showed resolution of previously seen STD and new PR depressions in II, III and aVF, which can be seen in RV infarct.
Echo showed evidence of mild LV dysfunction (EF 40-45%) c/w CAD, moderate mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization was deferred given respiratory distress likely secondary to heart failure and/or pneumonia, as well as the fact that she had persistent tachycardia equivalent to a stress test which she tolerated without recurrence of symptoms.
#Hypoxia - On arrival to CCU, CXR showed evidence of worsening pulmonary edema since admission after receiving fluids.
ABG showed 77/59/7.28/29.
Repeat CXR concerning for early infiltrate vs. aspiration pnuemonia.
#UTI: Pt had urine culture showing > 100,000 org/ML of enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin, which she was already receiving for aspiration PNA.
#Hypertension: Patient admitted with SBP 130's, and  became hypotensive in the setting of tachycardia and NSTEMI.
#Hyperglycemia - Initial chemistry significant for glucose of 222. patient is without history of diabetes, possibly stress response to acute myocardial infarction.
Continued to check finger sticks though admission which improved.
#Will need blood pressure modifications and possible adjustments given that now only on metoprolol and discontinued home clonidine, nifedipime and lisinopril.

You now do not need any oxygen and have no fever or other signs of infection.
You should check your pulse regularly to see if it is irregular which could mean the atrial fibrillation has returned.
Take Metoprolol succinate instead of atenolol to lower your heart rate and blood pressure 4.
Start aspirin and plavix to prevent blood clots in your heart arteries.
