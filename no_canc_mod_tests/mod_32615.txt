She was maintained at first on Bipap with sats >92% so was then weaned to NC with sats in the low 90s for most of the first hospital day.
When she fell asleep she did require CPAP with PS using full face mask set at IPAP of 15 and EPAP of 5 with 2-4L oxygen to maintain oxygen sats of 88-92%.
She was started on vanc/zosyn on [**2196-5-5**] for HCAP given that she lives in a [**Hospital3 **] and has had multiple recent hospital admission and her CXR had evidence of RLL infiltrate.
Cardiac biomarkers were flat (0.04->0.02), EKG in am was unchanged.
She had no further episodes of chest pain and her cardiac enzymes were negative.
Kept O2 sats 89-92.
# A fib on coumadin: She had a sub therapeutic INR of 1.7 on admission with good rate control with Cardizem and metoprolol.
# Acute on chronic Diastolic heart failure: ECHO from [**10/2195**] showed EF of 70-80% with Mild PAH and significant pulmonic regurg.
BNP was mildly elevated at level it had been on past admissions.
Her CXR did not appear grossly fluid overloaded so lasix was initially held but as above over the day she had some increasing O2 requirements and she was given her recently increased home dose of lasix.
We recommend continuing with daily weights, maitain goal I/O at negative 500cc /day, titrating lasix and monitoring electrolytes as necessary.
