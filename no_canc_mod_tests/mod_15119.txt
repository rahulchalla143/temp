On EMS arrival, her bp was 166/80 but for the most part it has remained in the 140's.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 1474**], head CT revealed L frontal ICH and she was transferred here.
Speech is non-fluent, to my exam restricted to nodding yes when appropriate.

MRI can be performed for further evaluation.
CT head - [**2190-12-30**] - 10pm IMPRESSION: Unchanged left frontal intraparenchymal hematoma and unchanged degree of mass effect.
Findings are suggestive of amyloid angiopathy, but an MRI can be performed to exclude underlying mass lesion or AVM.
MR head - [**2190-12-31**] PRELIMINARY READ: 8.3cm x 4.3cm L frontal hemmhorage.
DDX: Amyloid angiopathy, AVM, bleeding tumor, anticoagulants w/wo trauma, HTN possible but not typical location [**Name Initial (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD)   Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old woman with insignificant pmh presents with left frontal hemorrhage.
NEURO: A second CT scan 6 hours after the first revealed a stable hemorrhage.
A subsequent MRI also confirmed stable hemorrhage.
The MRI was not suggestive of amyloid.
We made a plan for a contrast study to assess for tumor when the bleeding resolved.
The blood pressure Goal was SBP > 100 and MAP < 130.
The patient's serum sodium and osmolality was checked serially.
She had a repeat swallow eval which she failed, therefore she had a PEG placed.
The patient was monitored on telemetry without significant arryhtmias.
