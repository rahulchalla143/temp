Hand X-Ray [**2127-2-12**]: Findings most consistent with advanced osteoarthritis, though the second MCP joint is narrowed as described.
Foot X-Ray [**2127-2-12**]: There are no fractures.
Chest CT [**2127-2-17**]: 1).
CXR [**2127-2-21**]: Observed changes suggest improved aeration of the areas with less degree of ground-glass densities but persistent mostly interstitial infiltrates.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo f with PMH sig for RA treated with pred/MTX, CAD, long h/o GERD, breast ca s/p left mastectomy presents from OSH for further eval of hypoxia (85% on RA) in the setting bilateral pulm infiltrates.
She had 3 negative sputum cultures for PCP.
Bronch vs VATS were considered to get a tissue diagnosis given her repeat CT after two weeks of PCP treatment with continued ground glass opacities, however pulm/thoracics/cardiology felt that these  procedures were too high risk given underlying cardiac disease (reversible defect on recent MIBI ([**10-12**])).
She had baseline PFTs done on [**2127-2-21**].
She will have a repeat CXR and PFT's in one month to monitor her lung function once PCP treatment has finished.
She should have a CBC with diff checked in one week for concern of granulocytopenia with primaquine and RA.
Cardiology saw pt for pre-op evaluation and felt she was at moderate risk.
Cr at baseline of 1.5.
