The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2148-4-4**], at which time he had a spincterotomy done and a stent placed.
The patient underwent a second endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2148-4-19**], at which time he had his stent removed.
The patient was being tested routinely for his laboratory studies including INR and was discovered to have an elevated INR to 5.1 and increased alkaline phosphatase.
The patient was contact[**Name (NI) **] by the Transplant Office and was advised to be hospitalized for a normalization of the INR and for further work-up of elevated alkaline phosphatase.
Cirrhosis status post orthotopic liver transplant on [**2148-3-5**] complicated by reactivation of hepatitis C and biliary stricture status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and stent; status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and removal of biliary stent.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, afebrile with temperature 98.8 F.; heart rate of 84; blood pressure 141/92; respiratory rate of 20; 99% on room air.
Cardiovascular examination is regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs were appreciated.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  Studies on admission with white blood cell count of 3.3, hematocrit of 23.5, platelets of 61.
Sodium of 132, potassium of 5.6, chloride 101.
Carbon dioxide of 18, BUN 29, creatinine 2.6 and glucose of 240.
Calcium 8.2, magnesium 1.4, phosphate 3.9.
AST of 133, ALT 38, alkaline phosphatase 987.
Total bilirubin 6.5, PT 22.9, PTT 49.0 and INR of 3.5.
The patient received two units of fresh frozen plasma with reduction in INR from 3.5 to 1.7 in the morning of hospital day two.
The patient was hydrated and the hematocrit dropped down to 20.8 with stable vital signs.
The patient received two additional units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of platelets giving a platelet count of 54.
The patient's INR was appropriately corrected and hematocrit returned to [**Location 213**].
The patient underwent ultrasound guided biopsy of the liver to rule out acute cellular rejection and there was no evidence of acute cellular rejection.
The patient peaked to an alkaline phosphatase of 1,041 on hospital day three and the patient received his regularly scheduled Peg-Intron of 150 micrograms subcutaneously in the evening of [**5-9**], hospital day three.
The patient's liver function tests did not significant improve with alkaline phosphatase staying at 1035 and after discussion with Transplant Hepatology, the patient was given a single dose of a short acting Interferon Alpha 2B, three million units subcutaneously times one.
Given the patient's history of low platelet count, the patient was observed over the next few days to make sure that his thrombocytopenia did not suffer too greatly and he no longer had further episodes of bleeding.
The patient did well otherwise and alkaline phosphatase gradually came down to 846 on the day of discharge, hospital day seven.
Given the fact that the patient had recently undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography two times in the month prior to this admission, a repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was not warranted.
The patient is to have his bloods drawn two times a week and every Monday and Thursday by a visiting nurse and the results to be faxed to Transplant Center.
