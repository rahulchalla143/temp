On exam her lateral aspect of the right 4th and 5th toes had a large area of ulceration with fibrinous exudate and some necrotic area extending to the plantar surface.
As the patient did not agree to undergo an amputation of the 5th toe in case this was felt to be necessary in the OR, an incision and drainage of the wound was performed.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and specimen was sent for cultures and pathology.
Her preoperative blood sugars were in the 350s, therefore insulin by sliding scale was infused with improved blood sugar control post-surgery.
Patient strongly felt that she would like to be transferred to Rode Island, and be managed by her podiatrist [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 30696**] DPM at the [**Hospital 30697**], so arrangements were done and patient will be transferred stable post incision and drainage to that institution for further management.
