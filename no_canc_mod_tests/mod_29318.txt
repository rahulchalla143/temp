His vital signs on presentation to the OSH were: Temp 103, BP 89/30, HR 116-138, RR 28, 97% on 2 L. His WBC was 15 (73 N, 11 L), CPK 253, (MB 21.5, Index 8.5), trop I 2.88.
Glucose was 310.
Bili 4.2, alk phos 91, ast 416, alt 325, LDH 1130.
CXR was negative for infiltrates, ECG with STE 1mm in I and AVL, PR depression in I and AVL.
An Echo showed an EF 25%, global HK, dilated LV.
100mg of lovenox was given empirically and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Renal, GI and ID were consulted for renal failure, transaminitis (to AST 11,916) and septic shock of somewhat unclear etiology.
Infectious disease got a history of the patient recently removing dead rodents from an automobile fan and felt that atypical organisms were highly likely.
Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: VS: Tm 103.7 Tc 101.4, BP 112/68 (88-122/62-88), HR 123 (125-150), RR 24 97% on Vent: AC: Tv: 700 x 24, FIO2 0.4, PEEP 10 -> PIP 35, Plateau 29, ABG 7.34/30/99, 7.32/28/130 CVP 23, CO 8.5, CI 2.63, SVR 687, MVO2 76 GEN: morbidly obese young man intubated and sedated HEENT: ETT in place, mmm Neck: large neck but no JVD appreciated CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, no m/r/g PULM: mechanical breath sounds appreciated, crackles at the bases bilaterally ABD: obese, NABS, NT/ND Ext: cool extremities, no c/c/e, 1+ DP and PT b/l Neuro: intubated, sedated Derm: no rashes noted.
Pertinent Results: CXR ([**5-17**]): Ill-defined opacities are present in the left mid and lower zones consistent with pulmonary consolidation.
CXR ([**5-18**]): Air bronchogram present in the left lower lobe suggesting LLL pneumonia.
Otherwise, extremely limited Doppler examination of the liver.
Chest/Abd CT ([**5-18**]): Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions.
No acute abdominal pathology  Sinus CT ([**5-18**]): No sinusitis.
Echo ([**5-18**]): Mild symmetric LVH.
Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with EF 15-20%.
LV inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure  ECHO [**2178-5-25**]:  Conclusions:  There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
EF 45%.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2178-5-18**], the LVEF has improved and the LV cavity size has normalized.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN [**5-27**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: *Shock: There was an initial concern for cardiogenic shock in the setting of possible pericarditis/myocarditis, EKG changes, elevated cardiac enzymes and Echo showing EF 25%.
However, fevers, elevated WBC count and low SVR suggested more of a septic picture.
Additionally, his cardiac output was elevated (though difficult to use those numbers which were from CVP and not swan).
Chest/Abd CT without pathology.
All blood and urine cultures showed no growth, he had negative serologies for Chlamydia pneumoniae, [**Location (un) **] B, Leptospira, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, HCV, HBV, Influenza and Parainfluenza,ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **].
A repeat serology was sent to the state lab and the results were still pending on discharge.
There was a suggestion of multifocal infiltrates on CXR suggesting possible pneumonia with bacterial pathogen.
ID was consulted and considered atypical organisms such as mycoplasma, chlamydia, legionella, Leptospirosis and viral pathogens such as hepatitis, influenza, adeno, CMV, EBV, HIV, [**Location (un) **] and Hanta virus.
He has scheduled follow-up with ID and his hantavirus serologies will be followed at that visit.
*Cardiomyopathy: Echocardiogram on [**5-18**] showed EF 15-20% in the setting of tachycardia (25% at the OSH on [**5-17**]), although windows suboptimal.
His BP was stable and heart failure and fluid retention was treated with CVVH.
Original primary still unknown at this point, as all blood cultures remained negative and he tested negative for all above mentioned possible viruses.
FENa was less than 1% and his renal failure was felt to be a complication of his shock.
The height of his LDL ([**Numeric Identifier **]) and the speed of the rise in LFTs is suggestive of shock liver and not congestion.
His INR and LFTs improved dramatically, confirming this diagnosis, steadily trending down over the course of his hospital stay.
He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**5-19**] which showed scant secretions that were negative for organisms.
He had bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on CT scan, and was started on vancomycin/zosyn, as well as doxycycline for atypical coverage, as above.
He had a persistent anion gap which was felt to be secondary to his renal failure, as repeat ketone/beta hydroxybutyrate assays were negative.
His sugars were well controlled on an insulin sliding scale.
*Pancreatitis: He had low grade fevers even after about 9 days of antibiotics, and in search of a cause, his pancreatic enzymes were found to be elevated.
An abdominal CT scan did not reveal radiographic evidence of pancreatitis.
It was noted that the enzymes trended up shortly after restarting propofol for sedation, and that this had happened once previously.
His amylase and lipase both began to trend down after propofol was discontinued again.
After transfer to the floor his lipase and amylase steadily came down, pt was non-tender in epigastric area on exam and denied abdominal pain.
*Splenomegaly: He was noted to have splenomegaly on both of his abdominal CT scans here.
He should likely have a repeat CT scan at some point in the future to re-evaluate the spleen.
His CBC should be monitored periodically as well.
He should follow-up with his PCP for repeat CT and CBC monitoring.
Pt's blood pressures were well controlled on metoprolol.
He will follow up with plastic surgery, and an appointment was scheduled for [**6-12**], for further evaluation and treatment.
Blood pressure medication, which he isn't taking .
Zosyn 2.25g IV q8h 2.
Hydrocort 50mg IV q6h 11.
Hep SQ 12.
