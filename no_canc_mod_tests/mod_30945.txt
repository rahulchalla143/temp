She received another 3 units of blood prior to endoscopy, which was only showed blood in the lumen of the bowel, no active bleeding.
Upper endoscopy was unremarkable.
The patient had tagged red cell scan on HD2 which was inconclusive.
Capsule endoscopy was inconclusive as well.
We recommended repeat tagged RBC scan, which was suggestive of a bleed in the region of the splenic flexure.
They we able to see the SMA which showed no active extravagation, but from the arteriogram was only supplying up to the right colon.
Since the bleeding scan was suggestive of a splenic flexure source, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] angio was attempted, but was unsuccessful.
She was left intubated at the end of the case  On POD 1 she received multiple boluses for low urine output and hypotension, but her Hct was stable at 31.
POD 3 brought a corrected acidosis, and echo was done showing a normal EF, but severe AS.
By POD 4 she was 35L positive, and her HCT had drifted to 27.
Cultures were drawn, CXR which showed infiltrate was taken and her CVL was resited.
Cultures grew back pseudomonas sensitive to Zosyn, so Vanco was d/c??????ed.
