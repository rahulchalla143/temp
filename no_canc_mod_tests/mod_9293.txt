Admission Date:  [**2193-6-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2193-6-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2118-3-15**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Acove  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old female with a history of mitral regurgitation, hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] Cardiology from [**Hospital6 33**] for cardiac catheterization after new onset atrial fibrillation, low ejection fraction and severe mitral regurgitation.
The patient presented to her primary care physician's office complaining of shortness of breath on [**2193-6-7**] when she was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate to the 150s.
Electrocardiogram performed at [**Hospital6 33**] showed a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction to 25% (prior ejection fraction 60% in [**2191-7-7**]).
She was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] on [**6-12**] for cardiac catheterization.
The patient's anticoagulation was reversed and she underwent cardiac catheterization on [**6-17**] which showed no flow limiting disease in the coronary arteries.
She had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with mitral valve prolapse, moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, normal biventricular diastolic function, heavy mitral annular calcification and an ejection fraction of 35%.
The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram and cardioversion on [**6-18**] with Amiodarone loading.
Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed a large acute anterior abdominal wall hematoma extending from the left rectus abdominis muscle with extension within the retroperitoneal space bilaterally.
Throughout the day on [**6-19**], the patient had episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressures into the 70s and was therefore transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Upon arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient's systolic blood pressure was 110 and she appeared comfortable and stable.
The patient receive 2 units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit was stable on a repeated hematocrit checks.
History of mitral annular calcification on an echocardiogram in [**2191**]; 8.
Note that prior echocardiogram also showed severe mitral valve prolapse with 3+ mitral regurgitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs reveal the patient is afebrile, blood pressure is 120/70, pulse 80, respirations 18, weight 72.6 kg.
Jugulovenous pressure 8 to 9 cm, no carotid bruits.
Strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Outside hospital laboratory data from [**6-8**] - Complete blood count, white blood cell count 5.0, hematocrit 37.2, platelets 187.
[**6-11**], PT 24.4, INR 3.0, PTT 35.4.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate 19, BUN 20, creatinine 0.9, glucose 110, calcium 9.6, protein 6.7, albumin 4.5, TSH 3.2, alkaline phosphatase 75, LDL to HDL ratio of 2.49, LDL 40, HDL 37, triglycerides 76, cholesterol 92.
Electrocardiogram [**6-8**], atrial fibrillation with rate 100 beats/minute, diffuse T wave abnormalities.
Electrocardiogram [**6-13**], atrial fibrillation with left ventricular hypertrophy, nonspecific interventricular conduction delay, ST-T segment abnormalities consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy.
Echocardiogram [**2193-6-13**], severely depressed left ventricular systolic function with global hypokinesis.
At discharge the patient had a stable hematocrit of 31.9.
b.i.d., (hold for heartrate less than 60, systolic blood pressure less than 110) Coumadin 10 mg p.o.
(Please check INR q.d.
with a goal INR between 2 and 3) Intravenous heparin at 1000 units/hour at the time of discharge, goal PTT is 50s to 60s, (please check PTT q.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19849**] [**Doctor Last Name **] at [**Hospital6 41495**], phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14967**].
The patient would benefit from [**Hospital6 2018**] Cardiology (phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2207**]) and Cardiothoracic Surgery (phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**]) follow up appointments.
