HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year old obese white female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2164**] and [**2168**], in anterior and inferior distributions with an ejection fraction of 10%.
The patient's cardiac history began in [**2164**] when she sustained an anterior wall myocardial infarction and subsequent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stent, with an left anterior descending with an ejection fraction of 30 to 35%.
An echocardiogram from his office reveals a dilated left ventricle with hypokinesis of the proximal anterior and inferior walls, dyskinesis of the septum and akinesis with an ejection fraction of 10%.
She had symptoms of fluid retention which improved but she developed nausea, vomiting and diarrhea with a decrease in weight of 25 pounds.
Her creatinine was noticed to be increased and she had an elevated digoxin level.
Telemetry at the outside hospital revealed pauses.
She was transferred on [**9-17**] to [**Hospital1 69**] for evaluation for a biventricular pacer and for advanced congestive heart failure management.
It was also noted during her hospitalization at [**Hospital **] Hospital that her INR was around 10.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature of 98.3 F.; blood pressure 102/56; pulse 46; respiratory rate 18; oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  Data on admission showed a white count of 5.9, hematocrit of 44.4 and a platelet count of 141.
Sodium was 141, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, BUN was 39, creatinine was 1.0.
Digoxin level was 1.4.
TSH 5.1.
Albumin was 3.8, calcium was 9.6 and magnesium was 2.0.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 86 beats per minute.
Chest x-ray disclosed cardiomegaly without evidence of failure.
The patient underwent a VO2 stress test on [**9-21**].
The resting oxygen consumption was 3.2 ml per kl per minute with a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.75.
The peak oxygen consumption was 45% of predicted.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**9-22**].
The cardiac output was 3.6.
The cardiac index was 1.56 with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 mm of Mercury.
B) Rhythm - the patient was monitored on Telemetry throughout her hospital stay.
On [**9-22**], she underwent an Electrophysiology Study with mapping of the left ventricle.
An echocardiogram on [**9-21**], disclosed an ejection fraction of 15%; there was right atrium and left atrium dilatation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function was depressed and with mild one plus mitral regurgitation.
Following placement of her pacemaker on [**9-23**], the patient was transferred back to the Cardiac Care Unit where she was noted to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the high 70s.
On [**9-24**], it was noted that her hematocrit dropped from 30 to 28.2.
Stool studies were sent as well as ova and parasites and Clostridium difficile; all studies were negative.
On [**9-19**], the creatinine increased to 1.8.
Prior to her catheterization on [**9-22**], the patient was hydrated and given Mucomyst.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:   The patient was maintained on a low sodium cardiac diet.
A Nutrition Consultation was placed and the patient was educated about the importance of the low sodium diet.
The patient's Coumadin was held during most of her hospital stay and she was anticoagulated with heparin with a goal of PTT of 50 to 70.
The patient was discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin and will have her INR monitored.
She should have her liver function tests, thyroid function tests and pulmonary function tests, and a slit lamp examination done since she has been started on Amiodarone.
The patient to have liver function tests, thyroid function tests and pulmonary function tests monitored.
