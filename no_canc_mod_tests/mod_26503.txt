Vital signs were otherwise within normal limits.
Femoral pulses were symmetric and 2+.
Although this     murmur sounded physiologic, evaluation was performed with     an electrocardiogram, chest x-ray and 4ext blood pressures     and these were all largely unremarkable with the EKG     revealing nonspecific ST changes.
