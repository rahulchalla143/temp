CT Head w/o contrast [**2169-1-28**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2169-1-11**] the ventricular premature beat is absent and there is increased QRS voltage.
ECHO [**2168-2-1**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-1-4**], the severity of aortic stenosis is similar.
A transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to further evaluate the aortic valve.

VANCOMYCIN Sensitivity testing performed by Sensititre.
# Multi-drug resistant Pneumonia:  Patient has history of MDR Pneumonia and was found to have lung consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA.
Blood cultures and urine cultures remained negative.
Sputum culture grew MRSA.
CT Torso was done which was negative for occult source of infection.
However, this was discontinued based on culture data.
Patient will be discharged to rehab with goal of weaning off ventilator, currently has been on trach mask during the day for the past two days and then he has been rested at night on the Ventilator on Pressure Support with a Pressure Support of 5 and PEEP of 5.
Head CT was negative for acute processes.
# CoNS + blood cx bacteremia: ??????
