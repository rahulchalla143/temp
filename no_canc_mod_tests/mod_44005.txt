His ICU course was notable for transient hypotension immediately after intubation requiring neosynephrine for a few hours, negative cardiac enzymes x 3, successful extubation [**6-12**], a mild transaminitis likely d/t poor perfusion/hypotension, a failed swallow evaluation [**6-13**], and new-onset asymptomatic bradycardia since [**6-13**] AM.
His sputum culture came back with moderate MRSA and sparse [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] as a result, he was started on a 14 day course of IV Vancomycin via PICC and PO Levaquin.
The patient remained afebrile but had gradual elevation of his WBCC and an accompanying bandemia beginning on [**6-18**].
Further w/u for source had been negative, including blood cx's, cxr, ua, ct abd/pelvis to r/o abscess, and MRI to evaluate for septic joint.
However on [**6-23**] a urine culture grew out yeast species.
Initial plan was for repeat ERCP to remove additional stones but in discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] of surgery it was felt that the patient would benefit from open cholecystectomy and subsequent exploration of the biliary tree as an outpatient elecive procedure.
A stress MIBI was attempted, but the patient could not lay still enough for the procedure.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed some NSVT during the dobutamine infusion (not uncommon per cardiology), yet his ECHO failed to reveal any ischemic wall motion abnormalities.
#FEN - despite initial failure, he passed swallow evaluation on [**6-14**], and tolerated regular soft diet/thin liquids during this admission.
His electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and repleted as needed.
An MRI was obtained of both hips which did not reveal any abscesses or anything suggestive of osteomyelitis.
