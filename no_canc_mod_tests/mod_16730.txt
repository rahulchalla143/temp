HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 70 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis (aortic valve area 0.99, with a gradient of 68), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and left lobe lung cancer status post left pneumonectomy.
The patient went to the Emergency Department in [**Hospital 4415**] where a chest x-ray showed right lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient's oxygen saturations dropped and the decision was made to intubate.
CBC showed white blood cell count of 26.8 with a differential of 83% neutrophils, 10% bands.
The sputum culture eventually grew Pneumococcus.
A Swan-Ganz was placed at the outside hospital on [**2139-10-28**] and showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Blood pressure 126/51; pulse 84.
Neurological examination shows cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact.
Pulmonary examination reveals no breath sounds on the left and scattered expiratory wheezes on the right with increased breath sounds anteriorly.
Abdominal examination shows a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen with normal bowel sounds.
LABORATORY:  Pertinent data on admission was white blood cell count of 11.9, hematocrit 33.0, platelets 174, neutrophils 94%, digoxin level 1.0.
PT 14.8, PTT 27.8, INR 1.5.
Urinalysis was negative.
Sodium 147, potassium 3.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate 40, BUN 56, creatinine 0.9, glucose 206, calcium 7.8, phosphorus 4.1, magnesium 2.3.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at outside hospital.
Pulmonary artery pressure of 30 to 45 over 10 to 17.
Systemic vascular resistance, [**2045**].
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure between 6 and 11.
Cardiac output 4.36.
Chest x-ray obtained here shows a decreased right sided effusion compared to chest x-ray obtained at outside hospital.
The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm most of the time but had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response at a rate of 140.
This was felt not to be due to Dofetilide so much as to the patient's structural heart disease, but the dose of Dofetilide was decreased.
However, because of the patient's sinus tachycardia, urine sodium of 20, urine osmolality of greater than 900 and increased BUN to creatinine ratio of about 50:1 and serum sodium of greater than 150, the patient was felt to be intravascularly depleted.
Chest x-ray and auscultation revealed no signs of overt pulmonary failure.
The patient did diurese well with improvement in his shortness of breath and his creatinine remained stable with resolution of his BUN to creatinine ratio.
The patient remained afebrile without a white blood cell count and there was no concern that his pneumonia had returned.
His INR was 1.5 the day prior to discharge.
h.s., his PT should be monitored and his Coumadin adjusted to achieve a therapeutic INR.
His blood sugars should be closely monitored and covered with a regular insulin sliding scale, because although the patient is not diabetic, he has had significant hyperglycemia from the Prednisone.
