In the ED BP 115/58, HR 92, RR 20, O2 sat 100% on RA.
He was tachycardic to 106, with some afib noted in the ED but not on EKG; BPs nl, O2 sat 100%.
EKG without ischemic changes, trops negative.
Labs were also significant for Hct 37.5, BUN 72, Cr 1.3, CK 4011, D-dimer 2670, urine tox positive for benzos and opiates.
An EKG was negative for any ischemic changes.
Pt refused NGL, seen by GI who recommended PPI, serial Hcts, and EGD in am.
Given elevated d-dimer and pt's reported contrast dye allergy, V/Q scan performed that was mod probability for PE (subsegmental V/Q mismatch in superior aspect of b/l upper lobes and posterior basal segment of LLL).
Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVT.
Given the ED's concern for not having a clear explanation for the pt's multiple complaints, and given that some of these complaints might point to acute problems, he was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring.
Mild tenderness to palpation in LLQ.

Brief Hospital Course: 44 yo M with hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, PAF, depression, anxiety, and h/o past narcotic, benzo, and IVDA who presents to the ED with multiple complaints including L pleuritic chest pain, nausea, possible hematemesis and melena, found to have intermediate probability study for PE on V/Q scan, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close observation overnight.
Bilateral LENIs negative for evidence of DVT.
CXR without evidence of enlarged mediastinum.
