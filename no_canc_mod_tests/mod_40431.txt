EMS found that she was unable to speak in full sentences and BP was 220; they put her on CPAP (10) and gave NG x 3 with improvement in sx.
By arrival to the ED, SBP was 130's; she was kept on CPAP for high RR (36) and started on a nitro drip and ASA 325 mg. TWI were noted on EKG in V5-V6 (though these were old compared to [**2164-1-4**] EKG).
(In addition, she was given ceftriaxone 1 g IV x 1 for a UTI; UCx from [**1-4**] grew Klebsiella, though returned after discharge so she has not received tx yet.)
VS were T 96.0, HR 65, BP 115/46, RR 12, 100% on 3LNC.
