At that time EMS was called and they found the patient to be tachycardic at 122 with a blood pressure of 140/40 with an oxygen saturation of 85% on four liters nasal cannula which improved to 100% on 100% nonrebreather.
On arrival in the Emergency Room, the patient's blood pressure was elevated.
She was tachycardic and mildly tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 79% on room air and 99% on 100% nonrebreather.
She also received intermittent IV boluses of normal saline for blood pressure support.
