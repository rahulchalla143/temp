CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ([**2157-8-2**]) 1.
The LMCA, LCx, and RCA had no angiographically apparent flow limiting epicardial coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed no evidence of systemic arterial systolic or diastolic hypertension with SBP 117 mmHg and DBP 89 mmHg.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the LAD, a pinched S1 and normal flow.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2157-8-2**]) The left atrium is moderately dilated.
LVEF 35%.
ECG on admission showed STE in the anterior precordial leads with ST depressions inferiorly.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 year old man with no significant PMHx admitted for anterior STEMI complicated by V fib arrest, s/p cath showing 1-vessel disease with BMS to proximal LAD.
#CAD: The pt presented with nausea, chest tightness, and diaphoresis s/p V fib arrest.
His ECG and enzymes were consistent with an anterior STEMI.
Pt received a BMS to prox LAD with and experienced hypotension post-procedure which was associated with and resolved after 20 cc coffee ground emesis.
A lipid panel was checked; however, it was likely suppressed secondary to recent coronary event and should be rechecked at a later date.
His ectopy greatly decreased during the course of his hospitalization and his rhythm problems were resolved at the time of discharge.
#Pump: A 2D echocardiogram showed a depressed EF of 35%.
The echo showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal and apical akinesis and the patient was started on anticoagulation with an INR goal of [**2-20**].
His liver enzymes were trending down but were still elevated at the time of discharge.
His HCT remained stable during his hospitalization and he was discharged on pantoprazole.
