He had been seen in the Emergency Department where a CT angiogram of his chest had been performed and revealed a pneumonia and he was treated over the next week with Augmentin for this.
However, he continued to have pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath and temperature of 102.
History of cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology, status post echocardiogram [**2-/2157**], showing ejection fraction of 25% with focal wall motion abnormalities.
ALLERGIES:  Bactrim which leads to an aseptic meningitis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 98.1, pulse 70, blood pressure 118/80, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 97% in room air.
Weight is 64.7 kilograms.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, the pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
His lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the right base with a few scattered crackles and otherwise clear.
His cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Extremity examination revealed a palpable cord over the left medial thigh which was nontender.
LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 142, potassium 4.1, chloride 102, bicarbonate 23, blood urea nitrogen 25, creatinine 1.1, glucose 97.
Calcium 9.2, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 3.4.
White count 4.2, hematocrit 49.9, platelets 206,000.
INR 2.6.
Partial thromboplastin time 33.7.
During his stay, however, he was found to have bilateral deep vein thrombosis and upon reread of his CT concern was raised for potential pulmonary embolism.
For this reason, he underwent a CT angiogram on [**2158-6-6**], which revealed a large left pulmonary artery embolism as well as possible right sided pulmonary emboli.
Instead, the patient was placed on Lovenox therapy given presumed failure to Coumadin therapy although it was noted that he may have required higher doses of Coumadin, i.e., levels greater than 3.5 in order to truly be anticoagulated with Coumadin.
The hematology and pulmonary teams were also concerned about the use of Epogen and whether a hematocrit of greater than 50.0 may be associated with high risk of thrombosis.
It was decided to continue Epogen therapy with goal hematocrit to be maintained less than 40.0.
Electrocardiogram was obtained which showed significant ST elevations in the inferior leads, and the patient was transported urgently to the catheterization laboratory for presumed acute myocardial infarction.
He subsequently underwent an echocardiogram which showed a preserved ejection fraction of 50% although he continued to have right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular dilatation and severe global right ventricular hypokinesis as a result of his inferior myocardial infarction.
He was placed on Aspirin and Plavix and slowly introduced to an ace inhibitor as his blood pressure tolerated.
During his hospital stay, he was noted to have question of a line infection in the CCU and was treated with a fourteen day course of intravenous Vancomycin to cover for any true infection, although his blood cultures remained negative.
He had undergone an extensive outpatient workup for infections which had been negative and this was again repeated during his hospitalization.
He also underwent a colonoscopy with biopsies which was unremarkable.
Hematology - The patient has a history of clots in the past although a partial hypercoagulability workup had been unrevealing.
Hematology consultation was ordered as above and a hypercoagulability workup was sent off.
