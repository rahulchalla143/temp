Vital signs revealed her temperature was 96.1, her blood pressure was 89/41, her heart rate was 69, her respiratory rate was 20, and her pulse oximetry was 97% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed anicteric sclerae.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities revealed 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Neurologic examination with asterixis present.
Rectal examination was guaiac-positive (per Emergency Department report).
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 9 (71.4% neutrophils and 16.2% lymphocytes), her hematocrit was 31.2, and her platelet count was 163.
Electrolytes revealed sodium was 133, potassium was 5, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was 47, and creatinine was 1.8.
Lactate was 2.5.
INR was 1.7.
Aspartate aminotransferase was 208, alanine-aminotransferase was 92, alkaline phosphatase was 161, amylase was 47, total bilirubin was 17.7, and her lipase was 69.
Albumin was 2.5.
Ammonia was 49.
Urinalysis revealed moderate bilirubin and 1+ urobilinogen; otherwise negative.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An abdominal ultrasound revealed portal vein was patent, small ascites (not enough for paracentesis), and nodule seen in the left lobe of the liver (which corresponds to an enhancing mass seen on recent computed tomography).
Cholelithiasis was present without evidence of cholecystitis.
A chest x-ray revealed a left pleural effusion, questionable left lower lobe infiltrate versus consolidation, and mild pulmonary edema.
Her ammonia level trended down during this time.
Throughout her hospital stay, close monitoring of her liver function tests and INR continued.
She was transfused one unit or packed red blood cells on [**3-22**] for a hematocrit of less than 28.
During her hospital stay, she had a colonoscopy that showed nonbleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed a small hiatal hernia, grade 1 varix at the gastroesophageal junction, and portal gastropathy.
Her hematocrit remained stable for the remainder of her hospital course.
END-STAGE LIVER DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had continued workup for her transplant including a stress test which showed no myocardial perfusion defects and had [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus testing.
With regard to her coagulopathy from liver disease, the patient was given vitamin K by mouth and subcutaneously during her hospital stay.
The patient's creatinine did improve with rehydration; however, she did not reach her baseline creatinine during her hospital stay.
Her creatinine did improve to 1.3 but then did worsen to 1.6 when intravenous fluids were discontinued.
Due to concerns about her blood pressure stability, her outpatient regimen, including atenolol and Diovan, were held throughout her hospital stay.
Following her colonoscopy, the patient's blood pressure did increase to a systolic blood pressure in the 80s.
Her blood pressure medications will be restarted as an outpatient when her blood pressure returns to baseline.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had evidence of consolidation/infiltrate on her admission chest x-ray.
Although, she was afebrile and did not have a white blood cell count elevation, there was concern that an infectious process could be leading to her decompensation.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were not revealing.
Her pulse oximetry did drop to 92% on room air during the evening that day.
A chest x-ray done following this event showed a small left pleural effusion, but no evidence of infiltrate or congestive heart failure.
