In ED had sats around 88%on RA, but placed on NRB, had CXR with possible consolidation of LLL vs hemorrhage and CT scan with consolidation and obstruction of LLL.
FUO -began in [**2195-4-6**] worked up by heme/onc, Rheum, and ID workup over the past 8 months which has been completely unrevealing to date.
Of note, the patient has negative HIV yet persistently low CD4 counts (mid100s), distal esophageal thickening with EGD [**4-8**] completely normal, left iliac/hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy s/p left iliac LN FNA bx which was nondiagnostic (exicisonal bx not attempted b/c location made it unresectable), and no abnormalities on vast rheumatological workup including [**Doctor First Name **]/RF/ANCA/Temporal Art Bx.
The patient has also had a vast imaging workup including head CT/MRI in [**7-9**] which showed only mild prominence of SA space over frontal lobes c/w mild frontal cortical atrophy.
Cholelithiasis 3.
Anemia- Workup has included EGD and colonoscopy as well as bone marrow biopsy all of which were negative.

Has had 3AFB smears negative in [**7-10**] for TB so less likely.
-Hx of negative AFB, low suspicion for TB at this time.
-Consider switching IV dex back to prednisone 80mg po qd per rheum recs.
-CK 31, which makes myositis very unlikely.
Neuro exam nonfocal and strength fairly well preserved on exam; do not suspect spinal cord involvement at this time.
CT chest showed small pericardial effusion, no clincal sign of tamponade present on exam.
Trop, EKG normal when completed.
-Cont metoprolol to 37.5mg po bid, K>4, mg>2, and considering cardiac MRI to r/o inflammation/myocarditis leading to NSVT.
