Of note, the patient's plasma creatinine should be checked on an every-other-day basis to adequately dose his vancomycin.
If the patient's creatinine is greater than 1.3, his vancomycin dose should be every 18 hours.
If his creatinine is 1.2 or less, then the patient's vancomycin dose should be given every 12 hours.
The Hepatology Service followed the patient and initially wanted a liver biopsy to further evaluate the cause of the elevated transaminases.
A computed tomography scan was performed which showed a stable appearance of multiple wedge-shaped infarcts involving the right kidney and spleen along with a cirrhotic liver.
On the day the patient was scheduled to have his biopsy, his transaminases improved, and the decision was made to postpone a liver biopsy at that time.
The patient was also to follow up with Cardiothoracic Surgery following completion of his intravenous antibiotics for evaluation of valve replacement.
; note, the patient should have his plasma creatinine checked every other day, and his vancomycin dose should be adjusted accordingly.
If his plasma creatinine is less than 1.3, the patient should have 1000 mg intravenously every 12 hours.
However, if his creatinine is 1.3 or greater, then his vancomycin should be dosed every 18 hours.
(hold for a systolic blood pressure of less than 100).
