He was taken to an outside hospital where his temperature was 92.9, pulse was 130, respiratory rate 12, blood pressure was 133/113, saturating 88% on room air with a 100% nonrebreather.
At that point, he was found to have a creatine kinase of 50,000, potassium was 7.4, and a creatinine was 3.2.
He was started on ceftriaxone secondary to a chest x-ray showing a left-sided aspiration pneumonia.
A head CT was also obtained and was negative.
An electrocardiogram had peaked T waves which improved once at the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department.
Here his temperature was 98.6, pulse was 83, respiratory rate was 18, blood pressure was 100/53, with an oxygen saturation of 97% on 100% nonrebreather.
While in the Emergency Department, his blood pressure dropped to 60/palpable, and he was given dopamine and fluids.
His oxygen saturations dropped.
At this point, his arterial blood gas was 7.16, CO2 was 52, O2 was 110 on the 100% nonrebreather.
With the chest x-ray showing a left-sided aspiration pneumonia; medications of levofloxacin and Flagyl were started.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm, tachycardic.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 21.2, hematocrit was 47.1, platelets were 168.
Sodium was 138, potassium was 7.2, chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 18, blood urea nitrogen was 40, creatinine was 2.9, blood glucose was 156.
Calcium was 5.3, magnesium was 1.6, phosphate was 5.6.
ALT was 170, AST was 608, alkaline phosphatase was 62.
Creatine kinase was 101,860; creatine kinase peaked at 120,000.
MB fraction was 0.8%.
INR was 2, PT was 16, and PTT was 32.6.
Urinalysis was amber with a pH of 5, with a specific gravity of 1.03, a large amount of blood, 100 protein, small bilirubin, trace leukocytes, many bacteria; otherwise negative.
Electrocardiogram had no signs of ischemia.
A sputum culture at this time returned methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive.
He was oxygenating well; however, he continued to spike temperatures along with an elevated white blood cell count that resolved over a few days without antibiotics.
A pleurocentesis was performed prior to the resolution, and it showed 201 white blood cells and [**Pager number **] red blood cells, but no growth on culture.
An ultrasound ruled out deep venous thrombosis.
A magnetic resonance imaging of the head was obtained which was negative for blood, infection, or edema.
Electromyogram showed a L5-S1 plexopathy, which did not explain the entire physical examination picture.
Therefore, a magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine was obtained.
An ultrasound was obtained to rule out an abscess in this area.
A magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic and cervical spine was obtained when the weakness persisted.
Creatine kinase trended down; last checked was 6274, and his electrolyte abnormalities resolved.
DISCHARGE RECOMMENDATIONS:  Between two to four months the patient should have a repeat ultrasound of the left gluteal region to assess for absorption of hematoma versus a mass that would prompt an outpatient workup.
