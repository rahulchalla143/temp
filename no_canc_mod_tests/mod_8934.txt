HYPOTENSION/REPSIRATORY DISTRESS: cxr with multifocal opacities versus pulmonary edema.
She rec'd a small bolus of IV fluids in the ER and her BP improved, she had also rec'd solumedrol 125mg IV.
ECHO was performed and was normal, LE ultrasound of left leg which was mildly edematous was negative for DVT.
PULMONARY EDEMA, DEMAND ISCHEMIA, ELEVATED TROPONIN: in the setting of LVH and likely diastolic dysfunction the patient had pulmonary edema on CXR, lung sounds likely pulmonary edema but in the setting of BOOP/COP this was difficult to determine.
Her troponin peaked at 0.07.
ECG was without significant change.
She was started on an aspirin while her cardiac enzymes were trended and after trending downward she was discharged on a full strength aspirin daily.
