RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2148-9-4**]):       SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
CXR [**2148-9-1**]: 1.
CXR [**2148-9-2**] Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2148-9-1**].
CT CHEST [**2148-9-2**]: 1.
Mixed solid and ground-glass left lower lobe nodule, concerning for bronchoalveolar carcinoma with a central adenocarcinoma, stable since [**2148-7-8**] but enlarged since [**2147-3-9**].
Renal U/S [**2148-9-5**] FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.7 cm and the left kidney measures 11.1 cm.
IMPRESSION: 1) Multiple simple renal cysts bilaterally.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2148-7-8**] the findings are similar.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2148-9-1**] there is no change.
Echocardiogram [**2148-9-2**] Findings left pleural effusion.
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2147-1-26**].
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-1-26**], the degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has slightly increased.
Pleural fluid was exudative with many WBCs and negative for malignant cells.
CT chest was concerning for left lower lobe nodule which was stable since [**Month (only) 205**] but increased since [**2146**].
Echocrdiogram on [**2148-9-2**] showed a mildly dilated LA, mild LVH and a normal EF>55%, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] pulmonary hypertension which had increased since [**2146**].
He was started on empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin) in the setting of a large R-sided pleural effusion seen on CXR of unclear etiology.
On [**2148-9-2**], the patient underwent a thoracocentesis after which 1800ccs of exudative fluid was aspirated (results WBC 3444* HCt 2.5* Polys 46* Lymphs 23* Mono 4* Eos 8* Meso 4* Macro 15* Protein 4.6 Glc 140 LDH 337 pH 7.38).
He had a CT-chest which showed the large right pleural effusion which was new since [**2148-7-8**], emphysema, healed rib fractures and more worryingly, a mixed solid and ground-glass left lower lobe nodule, concerning for bronchoalveolar carcinoma with a central adenocarcinoma but which has been stable since [**2148-7-8**] but enlarged since [**2147-3-9**].
Blood cultures were negative.
The cause of his right pleural is unclear as the effusion was not present on CT in [**2148-6-20**].
Of note, the pleural fluid cytology showed no malignant cells.
2) an inflammatory effusion given recent hemothorax following rib fractures 3) a parapneumonic effusion although WBCs were normal throughout his stay and sputum was negative (NB no culture or gram stain seem to have been done on pleural fluid).
His renal function was monitored daily and had strict Input/Output measured.
Given previous renal cysts, he had an U/S renal tract which showed multiple simple renal cysts bilaterally and no evidence of frank malignancy in addition to a persistent large right pleural effusion.

You were briefly treated with antibiotics and these were stopped as your blood tests showed no evidence of infection and you did not have any fevers.
