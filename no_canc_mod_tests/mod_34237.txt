Admission Date:  [**2139-6-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-6-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-6-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Zantac / Morphine / Tylenol / Naprosyn / ketorolac / Potassium  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: chest pain, hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None this hospitalization   History of Present Illness: This is a 45 year-old female with ESRD (on HD), chronic abdominal pain on narcotics, type 2 DM, HTN, HLD, CAD (h/o inferior MI, normal MIBI [**11/2138**]), h/o DVT, with extensive psychiatric history admitted on [**2139-6-16**] for chest pain and hypotension.
She was persistently hypotensive with SBP 73, which resulted in LIJ placement and initiation of Levophed gtt.
EKG was concerning with new small TWI in lead I, aVL; Cardiology felt no urgent intervention was necessary given recent reassuring MIBI (1/[**2138**]).
She had a CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrating an occlusion of the left subcalvian vein and collaterals to the LUE from the right with a thrombus in the right innominate vein graft with trace flow.
An IVC filter was in place.
In discussion with [**Location (un) **] dialysis of [**Location (un) **], her last session was [**2139-6-8**] in which her post-weight was 91.3 kg (she had 3 kg removed) and she had an extra-HD/UF session Saturday ([**2139-6-13**]) for 2-hrs removing 2.5 kg.
Her SBP has reportedly been 80-90s at baseline.
While in the MICU, she was continued on Levophed gtt with SBP of 100s, and upon cessation her pressures returned to 70 systolic.
Hypotension (likely mineralocorticoid deficient, hypo-renin, hypo-aldosterone, not likely complete adrenal insufficiency vs. autonomic dysfunction on Florinef) 2.

MICROBIOLOGY: [**2139-6-16**] Blood culture - pending [**2139-6-16**] Blood culture - pending [**2139-6-16**] C.diff toxin - negative .
EKG: NSR 100, trifasicular block (RBBB and LAFB) with LAD, hyperdynamic T waves compared to previous EKG in [**2-/2139**] and TWI in I, aVL.
IMAGING: [**2139-6-16**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO - Occlusion of the left subcalvian vein and collaterals to the LUE from the right (could be from an intercostal vein.
She also had an infectious work-up with negative blood and urine cultures, C.diff was negative, with no PNA on imaging.
She was dialyzed before discharge and her systolic pressures improved.
# EKG CHANGES - The patient has baseline tri-fascicular block (RBBB and LAFB) and also LVH and therefore T wave changes were difficult to interpret and non-specific (furthermore, discordance between ST and T wave is normal with BBB's) - T wave prominance could have been exacerbated by K+ (received single dose of Kayexalate).
She had serial EKGs which were reassuring and she was monitored on telemetry.
She had a reassuring repeat EKG and her telemetry monitoring was not concerning.
She had her troponins trended given some chest pain and the above EKG changes on admission, and these values were reassuring.
She had a MIBI perfusion study performed in [**11/2138**] without perfusion defect noted.
# HYPERKALEMIA - admitted with K+ 9.2(hemolyzed) in the setting of ESRD on HD and possible mineralocorticoid deficiency; received 30 gm Kayexalate x 1 with good response for repeat elevated potassium in the range of 5; EKG changes may have been augmented given hyperkalemia, but less likely.
Again serial EKGs were reassuring and her potassium improved with dialysis sessions.
# CAD - The patient is status-post inferior MI and MIBI in [**11/2138**] was reassuring without a perfusion defect.
Her 2D echocardiogram demonstrated an EF > 55% - though she had complaints of diffuse chest discomfort which resolved.
There was some concern that hypovolemia or hypotension may have precipitated demand ischemia, but her troponin and EKG findings were reassuring.
# ESRD ON HEMODIALYSIS - continued on HD regimen per Renal recommendations - M/W/F - continued nephrocaps, sevelamer and monitoring electrolytes.
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: 1. blood and urine cultures negative from this admission 2. follow-up will be scheduled with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] following given HD regimen 3. will continue with outpatient HD regimen M/W/F  Medications on Admission: HOME MEDICATIONS: 1.
