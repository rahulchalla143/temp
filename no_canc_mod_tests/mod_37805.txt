In the Emergency Department at the outside hospital, vital signs included a temperature of 97.8, blood pressure 175/106, heart rate 90, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.
The patient was admitted to the outside hospital and ruled out for a MI with a troponin-I of less than 0.05 and a CK of 102.
However, on [**2199-10-25**], the patient experienced lower chest pressure approximately 5 o'clock a.m.
The pressure lasted approximately 15 minutes and it was associated with new [**Street Address(2) 7093**] elevations in leads V2 through V5 on EKG.
It was decided that he should be transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
Before leaving the outside hospital, the patient had a MRI of his head which showed multiple areas of restrictive effusions consistent with acute or early subacute infarction in the right hemisphere.
A MRI showed no evidence of carotid stenosis.
CT of the head was negative for hemorrhage.
The patient was subsequently sent for cardiac catheterization.
On cardiac catheterization, the patient was found to have a right dominant circulation with single vessel coronary artery disease.
Hemodynamics from cardiac catheterization included cardiac output 4.48, cardiac index 2.24, RA pressure 5, RV pressure 52/3, pulmonary artery pressure 53/20, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25.
Coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization in [**4-14**], which showed normal LMCA, mild diffuse disease with up to 50% stenosis in the mid left anterior descending artery, mild luminal irregularities of the left circumflex with a small OM-1 with an 80% lesion, a small ramus intermedius with an 80% proximal lesion, and a RCA with mild luminal irregularity and 40% mid vessel narrowing.
Congestive heart failure, [**State 531**] Heart Association Class II.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.2, blood pressure 149/80, heart rate 73, respiratory rate 22, and sating 98% on 2 liters.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 8.1, hematocrit 45.2, platelets 218.
PT 12.9, PTT 43.9, INR 1.1.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.6, chloride 102, bicarb 22, BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, glucose 117, calcium 9.6, phosphorus 4.3, magnesium 1.8.
CK 494.
Patient was guaiac negative on admission.
Although the patient had a mild volume overload by his hemodynamic numbers on cardiac catheterization, he had no symptoms of congestive heart failure.
An atrial thrombus was a concern as the cause of the myocardial infarction.
A bedside echocardiogram was performed on the evening of admission during which no thrombus was visualized.
A more complete echocardiogram was performed on [**2199-10-28**].
The left ventricular wall thickness was normal.
Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated at 20-25%.
He was discharged on Lovenox to continue until his INR was therapeutic on Coumadin.
His creatinine remained stable throughout the admission.
Heme:  Patient's hematocrit was fairly stable throughout admission.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient's electrolytes were aggressively replaced throughout admission to keep his magnesium at 2 or greater and his potassium at 4 greater.
Patient's INR will be checked by VNA on [**2199-11-2**].
Patient's INR will be rechecked at this time.
