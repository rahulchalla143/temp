Imaging: CXR: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2151-11-15**]:  Lungs clear.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Brief Hospital Course: TTP: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Location (un) **] with severe thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, MS changes, and fever, likely TTP.
After plasma exchange, his platelets increased steadily, LDH decreased, and other hemolysis labs improved.
His retic count remained elevated.
His BP was slightly lower and he was transferred back to the MICU.
ECHO was relatively unremarkable.

His cardiac enzyme elevations were thought due to subendocardial ischemia vs. NSTEMI related to his other acute processes.
His troponins decreased subsequently and he did not experience any chest pain or other concerning symptoms.
CT/MRI head were negative at OSH.
Carotid US demonstrated 40% stenosis of [**Doctor First Name 3098**].
CT abdomen demonstrated peri-pancreatic stranding.
His symptoms improved and his enzymes stabilized.
CXR was normal.
Blood cultures were negative.
UA was negative though urine culture grew enterococci and coag neg Staph with a foley.
His WBC should be followed as an outpatient.
His blood pressure remained stable throughout admission.
