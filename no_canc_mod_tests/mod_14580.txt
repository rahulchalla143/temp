RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  A MRI in [**2175-12-28**] showed a dilated right ventricle with severe dysfunction and an ejection fraction of 21 percent, unobstructed RV/PA homograft, mild proximal PA narrowing bilaterally at the insertion of the conduit, mild left ventricular dysfunction, with an ejection fraction on the left side of 45 percent, dilated ascending aorta to 3.2 cm, vein graft to RCA had calcified disease, the RCA from the right coronary cuff was rotated clockwise, the graft in the aorta to the LAD and circumflex was patent, and the left anomalous vein was occluded.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 66 with frequent PVC's, ST depressions in V1 through V5.
Pulmonary function tests previously from [**2176-6-27**] in [**State 1727**] showed mild obstructive/restrictive disease which responded to bronchodilators.
A sleep study was also recommended to the patient which - in [**Month (only) 205**] - showed a mild sleep-related disorder with no CPAP; although this was recommended to the patient.
On catheterization, the patient had a cardiac index of 2.2 to 2.4, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 18 to 20, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 16 to 18, with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18.
He had branch PA stenosis at the insertion of the conduit, and conduit stenosis with a peak gradient of 20 mmHg.

No radial pulse on the right and a 2 plus radial pulse on the left.
He had a pulmonary compliance study also done preoperatively via esophageal balloon.
On [**1-15**], the patient underwent a redo sternotomy with a vein graft to the left anterior descending, coronary artery bypass grafting times one, biatrial radiofrequency maze, pulmonic valve replacement with 27 pericardial tissue valve, and reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract with a 24-mm gel weave graft.
