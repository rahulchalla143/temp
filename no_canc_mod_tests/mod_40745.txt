# CT HEAD [**12-11**] FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hyponatremia: The patient presented with mild symptoms of hyponatremia with a measured serum sodium of 113.
However, based on her labs, which included a low serum osmolality, a high urine osmolality and a FeNa of 0.66%, serum uric acid 1.7, the patient most likely had a second hit from SIADH.
CXR and CT head was normal.
Your blood sodium recovered spontaneously after fluid restriction.
If your urine output starts to decrease, it is important to drink less water and get your sodium checked.
For ANY symptoms of weakness or fatigue, you should go to the ER for a sodium check.
