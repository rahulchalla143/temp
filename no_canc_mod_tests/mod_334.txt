Per notes, her abdominal exam was significant for epitastric and right upper quadrant tenderness; positive gaurding; and no rebound.
CT showed a distended gallbladder with wall thickening and a small amount of pericholecystic fluid.
Common duct was dilated up to 11 mm and the pancreatinc duct was prominent at 5 mm.

Recent echo from [**2119-6-6**] whoed a normal RA and LA.
LVEF with 55% with normal regional LV systolic function.

[**6-14**] CT 1) Distended gallbladder with wall edema and possible pericholecystic fluid.
Further evaluation with ERCP or MRCP is recommended.
Further evaluation can be obtained with mesenteric CTA.
[**6-20**] CT 1.
[**6-26**] CTA 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
An ABG at that time was 7.44/39/52.
CXR showed minimal worsening of a left lower lobe consolidation with prominent bilateral vascular markings.
Pt defervesced over the nex few days and her oxygenation stablalized on 4 L NC with a sat in the high 90s and RR in the high teens.
In addition, pt had a low blood sugar of 65 which was treated with 1/2 amp D50.
ABG obtained at that time showed 7.38/56/66.
This morning, after receiving her morning nebs, the pt reported that she could not breath and her oxygen sat began to drop quickly going from 95 to 65%.
Pulmonary saw the pt and was concerned that this acute respiratory failure coud be secondary to bronchospasm.
However, PE was the primary concern to rule out given her acute hypoxia, tachycardia, and relative hypotension.
A CTA was negative for PE however demonstrated a large pleural effusion.
The patient's respiratory status markedly improved and her oxygen requirements decreased to 4L NC.
The patient's liver funcitions decreased after tube placement and stayed down.
