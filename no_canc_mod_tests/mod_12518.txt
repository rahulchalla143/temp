Angiography showed a 50% left main lesion; the LAD had proximal and mid 80% lesions; the first diagonal had a 90% stenosis; the circumflex was diffusely diseased; the obtuse marginal had a 90% lesion; and the dominant RCA had a proximal 90% stenosis.
Left ventriculography showed no mitral regurgitation and a LVEF of 25%.
Based on the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation was performed.
