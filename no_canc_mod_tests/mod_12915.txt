In the Emergency Room the patient was pan cultured and started empirically on Vancomycin, Gentamycin for endocarditis and sent for a CT to evaluate the patient's chest mass and a CT to evaluate the patient's neurological deficits.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 96.5, blood pressure 126/53, heart rate 82, respiratory rate 16, 95% on 2 liters.
Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 22.9, hematocrit 38.3, platelets 285 and 87, L 3, monocytes 1, 9 bands.
Electrolytes sodium 143, K 4.8, chloride 106, bicarb 24, BUN 48, creatinine 1.4, glucose 103, INR 1.3.
Urinalysis hazy, small leukocyte esterase, large blood, protein 30, greater then 50 white blood cells, 6 to 10 red blood cells, many bacteria.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute, left axis, normal intervals, Qs in 1 and AVL.
Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure, infiltrate or obvious emboli.
CT of the head showed two intraparenchymal fossae of hemorrhage seen at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter junction one most posteriorly along the phallic at the widex and the other within the left mid parietal lobe.
CT of the chest revealed joint effusion with enhancing margins and suggestion of tiny focus of air within at the left sternoclavicular joint.
On [**2-22**] ALT 96, AST 74, LD 400, CK 133, alkaline phosphatase 308, amylase 308.
Urine culture came back staph aurous coag positive, resistant to Penicillin.
Blood cultures came back positive, staph aurous coag positive resistant to Penicillin.
Echocardiogram from [**2-23**] showed limited study, because the patient was uncooperative.
Overall left ventricular systolic functio is normal.
LVEF of greater then 55%, no mass or vegetations are seen in the aortic valve, at least trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Echocardiogram from [**2-24**] shows the left atrium is normal.
Compared to the prior study from [**2-23**] an echo dense may have been present in the prior study, but images were suboptimal.
Chest x-ray from [**2-22**] mild upper zone redistribution with no pulmonary edema.
Chest x-ray from [**2-23**] consistent with slight left heart failure.
Chest x-ray from [**2-24**] showed worsening left heart failure with early pulmonary edema.
Chest x-ray from [**2-26**] shows OG tip below the left hemidiaphragm and increasing congestive heart failure.
Chest x-ray from [**2-27**] shows persistent left basilar opacity and worsened right lower lung lobe zone patchy opacity indicating worsening infiltrates with developing pneumonia to be considered.
Head CT on [**2-24**] possible slight progression of left posterior frontal hemorrhage is noted.
Head CT from [**2-27**] showed a stable hemorrhagic region compared with the prior study.
Changed to Oxacillin once the sensitivities came back sensitive to Oxacillin.
Ceftriaxone was later added in his hospitalization on [**2-27**] when a chest x-ray showed possible development of a pneumonia.
The patient's symptoms were thought likely due to septic emboli.
An echocardiogram was performed on his presentation.
