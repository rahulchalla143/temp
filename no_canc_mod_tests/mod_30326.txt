A Head CT and CT of the c-spine where without evidence of major abnormalities.
An MRI without contrast on [**2164-10-24**] was unremarkable.
Concern was raised for ALS and an outpatient EMG was arranged which showed an extensive sensorimotor polyneuropathy.

At presentation her clinical exam was notable for marked bifacial weakness, atrophic tongue with fasciculations, motor weakness ([**5-14**]) in upper extremities and lower extremities ([**4-13**]), hyperreflexia and marked dysarthria.
She eventually had a repeat EMG during the hospitalization that showed a generalized disorder of motor neurons or their axons.
Compared to the previous  study on [**2164-11-13**], in addition to the widespread fasciculations seen before, there was now diffuse moderate-to-severe active denervation in all muscles tested except the genioglossus.
CXR, EKG, arterial blood gas, troponins, electrolytes and eventual echo were unrevealing.
Her vital capacity at that time was found to be 590cc and her NIF was -22.
At discharge her vital capacity was 700cc and her NIF was -30.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 95472**] you were admitted to the neurology service for further evaluation of your worsening lower extremity weakness, difficulty swallowing and speech difficulties.
Your clinical exam was highly suspicious for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a EMG confirmed the diagnosis.
