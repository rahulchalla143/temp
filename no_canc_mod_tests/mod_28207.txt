Pertinent Results: Labs on admission: WBC 47.9 (90% neutrophils, 3% bands, 2% lymphs), Hgb 10.9, Hct 31.2, Plt 300 PT 54.3, PTT 49.7, INR 6.5 BMP remarkable for creatinine 3.1, BUN 61, glucose 116, potassium 5.8, bicarb 19, lactate 6 .
TTE [**2101-6-9**]:  Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction 30-40 percent) secondary to extensive apical akinesis.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-5-31**], an apical left ventricular thrombus is now evident.
Renal ultrasound ([**9-21**]): 1.
CXR ([**9-21**]): 1.
Indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm, which may represent atelectasis and/or consolidation.
ECHO ([**9-27**]): 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Compared to prior study on [**2101-6-9**], the LV apical thrombus is no longer seen and the PA pressure is now normal.
Blood cultures: 10/18 1/4 bottles E coli sensitive to ceftriaxone & pip/tazo [**9-22**] negative .
Stool negative for C diff X 4 .
Urine [**9-21**]: > 100,000 organisms/mL E coli sensitive to pip/tazo & ceftriaxone [**9-23**]: > 100,000 organisms/mL yeast .
Labs at discharge:  WBC 11.4, Hgb 11.1, Hct 32.4, Plt 307 PT 19.5, PTT 51.1, INR 1.9 BMP remarkable for creatinine 0.6, BUN 16, glucose 112, bicarb 30, sodium 136 lactate returned to [**Location 213**] 1.1 on [**9-21**] cortisol stim test within normal limits while in ICU   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 87 year old female with a history of Alzheimer's and prior urosepsis who presented with sepsis from a urinary source once again and who is now status post right nephrostomy tube & on antibiotics.
Her blood cultures as well as urine cultures show E. Coli sensitive to PIP/TAZO and ceftriaxone.
- The patient should have an outpatient renal ultrasound in a few weeks in order to reassess the functionality of the nephrostomy tube and to ensure that hydronephrosis has not reaccumulated on the left side.
# Leukocytosis: The patient's white count continues to decrease, and the patient continues to be afebrile.
Also, many white blood cells still in urine (nephrostomy < regular UA).
Her warfarin was restarted on the floor, and her INR is now 1.9.
- There is no longer a thrombus seen on ECHO which was done on [**9-27**].
She will continue on coumadin 5 mg QHS with INR monitoring at her nursing home.
- Her goal INR is 1.5-2.5. .
# ARF: The patient's acute renal failure seems to have resolved with stabilization of blood pressure and resolution of sepsis.
Her creatinine is now back to normal.
