PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination in the emergency department revealed that he was afebrile with a pulse in the 100 range and blood pressure of 160/palpable, saturation 98%.
His cardiac examination was regular.
His pulse was stable.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated in the emergency room and taken to the Department of Radiology, where he underwent an emergency head CT, which showed a small interparenchymal paraventricular hemorrhage on the right without other significant lesions.
The patient also underwent a T and L spine, which was negative, as well as a C-spine, CT, which showed degenerative cervical spinal changes.
His chest x-ray was without any pneumothorax or hemothorax and his pelvis showed no fractures.
At this time, he was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for every one hour neurochecks and control of blood pressure and further monitoring given his intracranial hemorrhage.
The patient spent two days in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, where he required a Nipride drip to control the blood pressure, which was in the 60s to 200s systolic prior to the initiation of the drip down to the 120s to 130s on Nipride.
He underwent two subsequent CT scans of his head on consecutive days, which demonstrated stability of the paraventricular hemorrhage.
He was transitioned from Nipride over to Lopressor for blood pressure control.
He had an MR of his spine, which demonstrated no acute ligamentous injuries, although, it was of poor quality secondary to motion artifact.
His cervical spine was cleared both radiographically and clinically without any tenderness in the posterior midline.
FOLLOW-UP CARE:  He was instructed to followup with the [**Hospital 16364**] Clinic for a repeat MRI in one to two months.
