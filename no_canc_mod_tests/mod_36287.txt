CXR [**2103-6-15**] There are no old films available for comparison.
CXR [**2103-6-19**] PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to [**2103-6-17**].
Echocardiogram [**2103-6-16**] Suboptimal image quality.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis suggested.
Renal ultrasound [**2103-6-18**] There is cortical thinning involving the kidneys bilaterally.
No previous studies are available for comparison.
LOWER EXTREMITY ARTERIAL DUPLEX U/S [**2103-6-19**] Bilateral outflow arterial disease in the lower extremities.
Brief Hospital Course: # Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction - Given acute on chronic renal failure and rapid improvement in symptoms, cardiac catheterization was deferred and the patient was treated with optimal medical therapy.
Continued aspirin, Plavix, carvedilol, Imdur, lisinopril, and atorvastatin on discharge.
TTE showed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral segments (LVEF 40-45%), mild aortic and moderate mitral regurgitation, borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Renal ultrasound showed evidence of medical renal disease but no hydronephrosis.
One set of blood cultures were negative.
# Acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection - Urine culture grew cephalosporin-sensitive, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. Coli.
The wound did not probe to bone on examination and there was no evidence of osteomyelitis on plain film (MRI was deferred given low clinical suspicion and renal insufficiency).
Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound showed bilateral outflow arterial disease in the lower extremities with disease located at the distal popliteal/tibial arteries on the right and likely located at the superficial femoral artery on the left.
Blood sugar was well-controlled on this dose of basal as well as sliding scale insulin.
# Anemia of iron-deficiency and chronic kidney disease - Hematocrit remained stable obviating the need for transfusion.
# Hyperlipidemia - Lipid panel was suboptimal, with a total cholesterol of 233 and calculated LDL 155.
TSH was within normal limits.
