If clinically indicated, a non-contrast CT of the left shoulder may be helpful in evaluating the placement and extension of these clips.
Per neurosurgery's recommendations, the patient was treated with a hard c-collar at all times (for 6 weeks), log-roll precautions, and an MRI/MRA of the pt's neck was performed to rule out carotid & vertebral artery injury.
Because of left shoulder numbness & weakness you had an MRI which showed traumatic injury of your scalene muscle but no obvious injury to the nerves (brachial plexus).
You may require an additional test known as an EMG if your weakness persists.
Please follow up with your primary care doctor in the next week regarding your blood pressure and overall physical.
