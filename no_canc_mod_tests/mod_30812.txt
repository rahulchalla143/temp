In the ED, her vitals were: T 98.7, BP 62/30, RR 20s, Oxygen saturation 98% on RA, HR 68.
She was intubated for airway protection and a tiple lumen was placed.
A head CT was completed and negative for any acute process.
An echo was completed and cultures were sent.
Her creatinine was elevated up to 2.0, but urine output remained good.
Past Medical History: -CAD with LVEF > 50%, s/p CABG in [**2195**] (LIMA>>LAD, SVG>>PDA and OMI), stent placement in [**2199**], cath demonstrated 2 VD -NonQ wave MI -Aortic Valve Replacement [**2195**], Mitral Valve ring-annuloplasty -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -Hypothyroidism secondary to RAI for [**Doctor Last Name 933**] Disease -Depression with psychosis -Discoid Lupus -PTSD -Carcinoid s/p resection in [**2173**] -COPD -s/p TAH and b/l BOS -Hemolytic Anemia -Migraine -T9/T10 Disc Herniation  Social History: Lives at home with her son, daughter, granddaughters, nephew, [**Name2 (NI) 802**], and granddaughter's close friend.
Physical Exam: VS: Tm 96.0 BP 125/70 HR 64 O2: on AC Gen: sedated, intubated HEENT: PERRL.
Upon admission to floor from MICU: Tm 98.4 Tc 98.2 BP 130/62, range 126-130/60-62 HR 74 RR 16, 97% on RA FSBG 125 @ 1700 Weight 89.1 kg -General: Pleasant female appearing younger than stated age, in NAD, resting in bed comfortably, appearing slightly tired.
CXR: [**2203-8-7**]: FINDINGS:  Bedside AP examination labeled "supine at 19:40H" is compared with the similar study obtained approximately one hour earlier.
CT Head: [**2203-8-7**]: FINDINGS:  There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
ECHO [**2203-8-8**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-2-17**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.
# Hypotension/Medication Ingestion: Given the acute onset of symptoms shortly after the patient reports she took "all of her pills," it is highly likely, as thought by the MICU and ED teams, that the patient suffered adverse consequences of taking too many blood pressure and sedating medications at once.
It appears that she took her klonopin, lisinopril, triampterene/HCTZ, diovan, lopressor, and imdur, all at one time.
- Her blood cultures were all negative, with the [**2203-8-9**] culture still pending at time of discharge--it was felt that sepsis was very unlikely.
Given her cardiac history, it was desirable to get her beta-[**Month/Day/Year 7005**] and [**Last Name (un) **] restarted, so she was titrated back up to 100mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], and 40 of valsartan, with blood pressures remaining in the 100-120 systolic range--she was switched to Toprol XL for easier dosing at discharge.
- Food preparation alternatives and low-salt diet was discussed at length with patient, as it was recognized that she ate a lot of salty food and her pressures would likely rise upon return to her home.
- Social work and psychiatry set up a social work appointment for shortly after discharge, as well as arranged for patient to enter partial hospitalization program at [**Hospital1 882**] hosptial on [**Hospital1 766**] the 24th.
Baseline creatinine is about 1.3 and her peak was 2.0.
# Hypothyroidism- Per OMR notes, her dose was recently increased in [**Month (only) 205**], although patient states she never changed her dose and has continued to take 112mcg, and now her TSH is low at 0.041.
Patient did not appear hyperthyroid on exam and it was felt that an overdose of levothyroxine was unlikely to account for the low TSH.
# AVR: On coumadin for aortic valve replacement, INR Goal 2.5-3.5.
Meds: Per OMR -albuterol PRN -aspirin 325mg daily -atorvastatin 10mg daily -clonazepam 1mg QAM, 2mg [**Hospital1 **] -clopidogrel 75mg daily -folic acid 5mg daily -imdur SR 60mg daily -lamictal  50mg QAM for now (CHECK OMR FOR EXACT DOSING) -levothyroxine 112mcg daily -metoprolol tartrate 100mg [**Hospital1 **] -ntg PRN -percocet 2.5/325 1mg Q6:PRN -protonix 40mg daily -prozac 10mg QAM -seroquel 300mg QHS -triampterene/hydrochlorthiazide 37.5/25 1tab daily -valsartan 80mg daily -warfarin 3mg as directed .
It was thought that the very low blood pressure was a result of taking too many medications at one time.
You were monitored carefully, and a number of test were completed to ensure there were no other causes for your illness.
You should take your medications exactly as prescribed, and follow up closely with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**] to monitor your blood pressure and medications.
