In ED, CTA revealed several small left pulmonary embolus and echo showed small free floating intracardiac thrombus without signs of right heart strain.
Troponins were negative.
ECG unremarkable.
CBC and BMP were WNL.

No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
COLOR DOPPLER AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS: The main, anterior right, posterior right and left portal vein demonstrate normal directional flow and waveforms.
Doppler evaluation of the main and segmental renal arteries of the upper, mid, and lower poles of both kidneys were performed.
# DVT/ PE/RV thrombus: The patient was transferred from an OSH after being found to have a PE and small RV thrombus while on lovenox and coumadin for a femoral and popliteal vein DVT that he had developed on [**1-21**], about a week earlier.
An echo was performed which showed no intervenable clot in the heart and although there was RV dilation, there was no evidence of strain.
Hem-Onc was consulted and recommended that if any further hypercoag work-up should be done, it should done as an outpatient.
He will follow up with his PCP for INR check and warfarin dose adjustments.
He continued to have good urine output and his Cr stablized at 4.1 and slowly dropped throught the remainder of his hospital stay and was discharge with a Cr at 3.4.
His metformin was not restarted and he was started on insulin glargine until his kidney function improved.
He underwent a abdominal ultrasound that revelved a fatty infiltration of his liver.
He was instructed to follow up with GI and his PCP for further evaluation and management.
# GERD: He complained of GERD and diarrhea symptoms, which were felt to be from a viral gastroenteritis or norovirus.
Given his thrombotic history and his worsening abdominal pain, a repeat EGD is likely warranted.
Medications on Admission: - Aspirin 325 - Plavix 75 - Lovenox 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] - Glyburide 2.5 mg daily - Imdur 30 - Warfarin just started - Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] - Protonix 40 mg daily - Zocor 20 mg Qam 10 mg qpm - Loratadine 10 mg daily - Metformin 500 [**Hospital1 **] with meals - Flomax 0.4 mg daily - Losartan 25 mg  Discharge Medications: 1. insulin glargine 100 unit/mL (3 mL) Insulin Pen Sig: Ten (10) units Subcutaneous at bedtime.
You had an echo performed, which showed no intervenable clot in the heart.
Because your kidney function is worse, you were not restarted on your diabetes medicines and will take long acting insulin at least until your kidney function resolves.
Your INR is 3.1 today.
Please continue to take warfarin 2mg daily and get your INR checked on Monday [**2-7**] at Dr. [**Name (NI) 77344**] office along with your other labs.
