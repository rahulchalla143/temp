At the OSH, her HR was in the 130s with BP in the 80s; initial hct 31 --> 24.6, intial INR 10.
Hct here 26.6, INR 2.7.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring and transfused an additional pRBC with goal hct >28 given h/o CAD; no active ischemia at this time.
GI was consulted and on HD#2 due to ongoing melena, with an INR of 5.8, she was transfused 3u FFP prior to having an additional EGD which was unremarkable for any ulcer or bleeding diathesis.
Her hct remained stable over the next day, with no further episodes of melena.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 55 y/o F with a PMHx of MS, CAD s/p MI/LAD stent in [**10/2174**], FVL def and Prot S deficiency on coumadin, presented to an OSH with melena and found to have an INR of 10. .
Plan: # Melena/Coffee ground emesis Pt with melena and 14 point drop in hct in the context of an INR of 10.
Pt is s/p FFP, Vit K at OSH, INR 2.7 at time of admission.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring and transfused an additional pRBC with goal hct >28 given h/o CAD; no active ischemia at this time.
GI was consulted and on HD#2 due to ongoing melena, with an INR of 5.8, she was transfused 3u FFP prior to having an additional EGD which was unremarkable for any ulcer or bleeding diathesis.
Her hct remained stable over the next day, with no further episodes of melena.
HCT remained stable and she had no episodes of melena or hemetemesis while inpatient.
# Coagulopathy Pt with a reported INR of 10 at OSH, unclear etiology, but likely due to decreased PO intake over the past 2 weeks with poor follow up of INR levels.
Her INR decreased to 1.8.
However, INR continued to fall from 1.8 and her coumadin was increased slowly to 5 mg PO QD and lovenox bridge was started on [**2176-7-1**].
Her INR will NEED TO BE FOLLOWED CLOSELY as an outpatient, with goal [**2-23**].
Plan to continue lovenox until INR therapeutic.
EKG only showed <1mm of ST depressions laterally; 2 sets of CE's were negative.
Her hct was transfused as needed to maintain hct >28.
Her ASA, plavix were held, and her cardiologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] due to the fact that patient had been on Plavix >18 months post-stent placement.
Her bblocker was initially held and then restarted once her SBP was stable.
# Factor V Leiden & Protein S deficiencies Pt with a hypercoagulable state, currently on coumadin and Plavix for anticoagulation.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
Hct stable without evidence of ongoing bleeding.
