She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardaic cath and further care.

The OM1, OM2, and OM3 were all relatively small caliber vessels with mild plaquing.
Left ventriculography demonstrated normal systolic ventricular function with a calculated ejection fraction of 59%.
The peak to peak transaortic pressure gradient was 20mmHg and the mean gradient was 16mmHg.
The [**Location (un) 109**] using the Gorlin equation was 1.1cm2.
CNIS [**9-23**]: Minimal right ICA plaque, no associated stenosis (graded as less than 40%).
Chest CT [**9-25**]: Biapical scarring without evidence of cavitation or small airways disease to suggest active infection.
Followup chest CT is recommended in three months to assess interval stability/change.
Prominent right paratracheal lymph nodes which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement, but should be reassessed on the followup chest CT in three months.
A thyroid ultrasound would better characterize this abnormality, if warranted clinically.
Echo [**9-26**]: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated.
Post-Bypass: A well seated aortic valve bioprosthesis, functioning well, PG15 and mean gradient of 8.
Mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] CXR [**9-30**]: IJ catheter terminating in the right atrium.

She underwent cath on [**9-22**] which revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease [**Doctor First Name **] with mitral and aortic valve disease.
She then underwent an echocardiogram which confirmed moderate to severe aortic stenosis but showed only mild mitral regurgitation.
She underwent multiple diagnostic work-up prior to surgery which included CNIS, chest CT, and dental consult.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
She had her chest tubes removed and was weaned off of Neo-Synephrine.
Also on this day she received blood transfusion for low HCT.
