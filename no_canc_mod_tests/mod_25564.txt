Imaging Studies: ECG Study Date of [**2198-10-23**]  4:45:36 PM Sinus bradycardia.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2198-10-23**] 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left sided filling pressure with an LVEDP of 21 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was depressed at 1.69 l/min/m2.
Central aortic systolic pressure was in the range of 100 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed no evidence of mitral regurgitation.
The final angiography showed TIMI III flow with no evidence of dissection, embolizatio or perforation.

LHC showed total occlusion of LAD prior to diag, clean coronaries otherwise w/ collaterals to LAD region.
LV gram revealed EF 40%, PCWP 10, CI 1.69.
Post cath echo showed and EF of 40% with hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
Lipid panel showed 169/total, 76/trig, 43/HDL, and 111/LDL.
Urine analysis was positive for a UTI with few bacteria and 21-50 WBC and the patient was started on Levaquin.
Urine was negative for chlamydia and gonorrhea.
With a presumed history of bacteremia with staph aureus, the patient underwent a TEE to rule out endocarditis that was negative.
CT scan showed no liver abscess or other signs of infection and his hepatitis panel was negative.
Liver transaminases were transiently elevated, but this is more likely due to his recent MI than an acute liver infection.
Abdomen/pelvis CT imaging showed heterogeneous enhancement of the prostate and seminal vesicles that was concerning for tumor vs. infection.
His prostate was smooth and firm on exam without tenderness.
You were taken to the coronary care unit for close monitoring and remained stable for 72 hours after your heart attack.
You had a echocardiogram of your heart to evaluate for bacterial growth on valves and it was normal.
You should have a prostate serum antigen (PSA) checked in 1 month for resolution of prostate infection and also to evaluate screening risk for cancer.
Your PCP should evaluate risk for prostate cancer given elevated PSA level and CT pelvis finding of enlarged prostate, concerning for tumor.
You should have a follow up CT abdomen/pelvis in 3 weeks to evaluate the prostate, after completing antibiotic course.
