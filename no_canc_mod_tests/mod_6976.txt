CT of the abdomen was negative.
At the outside hospital he had been started on Levaquin for abdominal source and Vancomycin for MRSA-positive blood cultures and pneumonia.
[**Hospital1 69**] course was notable for admission to Vascular Surgery Service, where he underwent CT of the chest on [**2191-7-22**], which showed evidence for diaphragm level, descending thoracic aorta aneurysm with penetrating ulcer versus mycotic aneurysm, without hematoma or bleeding.
Per the Department of Vascular Surgery, blood pressure control was goal to be less than 140 systolic and he was started on Diltiazem, Hydrochlorothiazide, and Captopril to prevent the aortic ulceration.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on transfer: Temperature 98.3, pulse 96, blood pressure 122/50, saturating on 98% on two liters, respiratory rate 25.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following: White count 9.2, down from 40.3, hematocrit 28.2, down from 31.7, platelet count 362,000.
PT 12.8, INR 1.1, PTT 26.8.
Urinalysis from [**2191-7-23**] was negative.
Chem 7:  Sodium 134, potassium 3.8, chloride 89, bicarbonate 38, BUN 23, creatinine 0.5, blood sugar 136.
CKs were less than 100 times three; troponin 1.5 on [**2191-7-22**].
Potassium was 8.9, magnesium 1.7, phosphate 3.3, albumin 2.8.
ABG on [**2191-7-25**] at 4:50 AM was pH 7.47, pCO2 57, pO2 165 on four liters oxygen.
Chest x-ray on [**7-25**]/200 showed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with linear atelectasis, scarring in the left upper lobe, no pneumothorax, no congestive heart failure.
Blood cultures from [**2191-7-24**] showed no growth to date.
Urine cultures on [**2191-7-23**] showed no growth to date.

Sputum from [**2191-7-17**] had moderate Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with 0 to 5 polys on high power field.
In the last few days, medications have been titrated up to keep the systolic blood pressure below 140 per Vascular Surgery.
The patient's oxygen requirement decreased to two liters, which is his home requirement.
In the intervening days, the patient's respiratory examination improved slightly.
Hematocrit was notable to be at low 28.2 on [**2191-7-25**].
The hematocrits since that time have been improved with the hematocrit on [**2191-7-27**] being 33.
Iron studies were done with the iron of 143, TIBC 183, ferritin greater than 100, and TRF 141.
Per the Neurological Department the patient will need head CT and EEG for further evaluation.
He will need further followup with the Department of Neurology after discharge.
