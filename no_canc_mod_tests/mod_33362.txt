A CTA showed  Multiple small fluid pockets along the course of the right ax-[**Hospital1 **]-fem graft.
His cultures grew MRSA, sensitive to vancomycin, so the zosyn was discontinued.
His WBC count remained high post-operatively, and a new infectious w/u showed a UTI.
Pre-operatively, an ECHO was obtained per anesthesia, which showed LVEF>55%, and probable normal left ventricle function, though a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded, and showed Mild mitral regurgitation.
A stat cardiology consult was obtained for an ECHO which  RV is more clearly visualized and appears dilated and hypokinetic compared to the previous study.
He had a troponin leak during this time, but it was likely due to repeated chest compressions, and after evaluation by cardiology a cardiac cath was not indicated.
Pt was intubated intra-operatively and weaned slowly off the vent after his second surgery once his RISB scores were low and felt safe to do so.
He did require multiple transfusions of pRBCs, FFP, and platelets post-operatively for low hct, platelets.
His preference was to return to the nursing home, which has been arranged.
