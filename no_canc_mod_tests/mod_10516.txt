Platelet count was 204.
Blood urea nitrogen was 13.
Creatinine was 0.8.
Glucose was 124.
Physical examination revealed the patient's leg with the intra-aortic balloon pump which was slightly modeled was improving with warm feet and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.

The first time the patient was converted from atrial flutter to atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 90s.
Vital signs were stable with an index of 2.3 and central venous pressure of 20.
Oxygen saturations were greater than 95% on 4 liters nasal cannula and just under 90% on room air.
White blood cell count was 9.7.
Hematocrit was 31.3.
The patient was in sinus rhythm now at 82 with a stable blood pressure and adequate urine output.
