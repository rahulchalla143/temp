The patient was evaluated by the stroke team, and MRI showed a left inferior MCA cerebrovascular accident with evidence of M2 segmental occlusion.
The patient was then transferred to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit where, after TPA, he was noted to have improvement in right extremity strength, speech pressure was closely monitored, with a goal of systolic 140 to 160, titrating intravenous labetalol and Neo-Synephrine.
Anticoagulation with heparin drip and Coumadin, with an INR goal of 2 to 3, and PTT goal of 40 to 60.
Cardiomyopathy- EF 25% 2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs:  Temperature 95.8, blood pressure 130/60, heart rate 85 which was irregular, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 95% on 3 liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, mucous membranes dry.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, warm, dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally.Bilat necrotci heel ulcers- dry wtih eschar.
LABORATORY DATA:   On [**2108-4-28**], white cells 8.6, hematocrit 27.4.
Sodium 136, chloride 106, bicarbonate 23, BUN 23, glucose 84.
On the day of transfer to Medicine service, [**2108-5-1**], white cells 13.1, hematocrit 27.8.
Sodium 147, potassium 4.2, chloride 112, bicarbonate 20, BUN 28, creatinine 1.7, glucose 141.
PT 25.8, PTT 66.8, INR 4.6.
Calcium 8.0, phosphate 5.3, magnesium 1.9.
Urine culture from [**4-30**] showed 10,000-100,000 yeast.
Chest x-ray from [**4-30**] showed perihilar haziness, slight vascular engorgement suggestive of pulmonary edema, persistent dense left retrocardiac opacity, right pleural effusion, mass-like opacity centrally in the right upper lobe.
Based on recommendations by the Neurology team, a repeat MRI and MRA were performed of the head.
It was the feeling of the Neurology team, based on this study from [**2108-5-12**], some 13 days after his stroke, that the patient's prognosis for improvement was "excellent."
A swallow eval was ordered however was delyaed due to lack of availability of speech/swallow satff.
Finally a video swallow was done and pt found to have aspiration of all consistencies.
Repeat eval done [**5-22**] showed noimprovemend so a PEG tube was placed.
Electrocardiograms were obtained and showed no ischemic changes and cardiac enzymes were cycled intermittently and showed no elevation.
Chest x-rays were obtained, however, did not show pronounced vascular engorgement.
Swan numbers showed that the patient had an elevated wedge as well as pulmonary artery pressure which was attributed to the patient's 3+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient was maintained on beta blocker and ACE inhibitor, and the doses of both were titrated upwards based on blood pressure tolerance.
c.  Rhythm:  Patient with a history of atrial fibrillation, however, on transfer from the Neurology service on [**5-1**], the patient was noted to have an INR of 4.6.
The patient's goal INR was 2 to 3.
The patient's oxygen saturations remained in the mid-90s on initially 2 liters of oxygen, and later on during his hospital stay on room air.
It was thought that the mass-like opacities in the right upper lobe were a septic emboli from the patient's recent endocarditis and, on repeat serial chest x-rays, it was noted that this opacity was improving and resolving gradually.
The patient was maintained on those antibiotics, and had the addition of vancomycin when methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus sparse growth was isolated from a sputum obtained in the Coronary Care Unit.
Vancomycin levels were checked, and the patient was noted to have peaks and troughs within the normal limit.He completed 2 weeks of these atibiotics and then they were dc'd.
This was thought to be likely pre-renal, with a FENA of less than 1.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was noted to have a hypernatremia as high as 152.
