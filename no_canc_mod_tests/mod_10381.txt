Her sternum was rewired and the wound was left open with packing.
Over several days postoperatively from her re-exploration, she was again diuresed and slowly weaned from full ventilatory support to pressure support ventilation with decreasing amounts of PEEP and pressure support.
On postoperative day #16 from her initial surgery and postoperative day #6 from her re-wiring, the patient had a bump in her white blood cell count.
A chest x-ray following placement of the left chest tube showed a resolved pneumothorax.
On postoperative day #19 from her initial surgery and postoperative day #9 from her re-exploration, the patient was again extubated.
On postoperative day #26 from her initial surgery and postoperative day #17 from her re-exploration, it was deemed that the patient was ready for transfer to a rehabilitation center for continuing rehabilitation and postoperative care.
