The pt was never hemodynamically unstable in the OSH ED (HR 81-96, BP 111-150/67-80).
An EGD done on the day of admission there showed blood with clots in the stomach but no active bleed; a 3-4 cm submucosal mass was seen in the fundus of the stomach with overlying clot consistent with a recent bleed.
A CT scan of the abdomen showed splenomegaly and prominent varices clustered in the area of the fundus and GE junction.
Given these findings, the pt was transferred here for further evaluation and treatment for portal hypertension.

Conventional liver anatomy and blood flow with patent hepatic veins and portal vein.
Brief Hospital Course: This patient was a 49 yo man with remote history of alcohol abuse, ongoing binge alcohol use, and remote intravenous and intranasal drug abuse who has not seen a physician in over thirty years was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH for further evaluation of hematemesis and gastric varices.
The patient had an abdominal ultrasound and CT scan, as well as celiac angiogram as part of a workup of portal hypertension.
He also had Hepatitis C serologies drawn which showed a positive Hep-C antibody and Hep C viral load of >700,000 by PCR; Hepatitis B serologies were only remarkable for positive core antibody.
He had an abdominal ultrasound on [**8-29**] which demonstrated a coarsely echogenic liver texture without evidence of focal lesions, a small amount of sludge in the gall bladder, and splenomegaly.
A CT scan on [**8-30**] demonstrated similar findings as well as conventional liver anatomy.
His celiac angiogram on [**9-2**] demonstrated an enlarged left-sided renal vein with possible small splenorenal shunt, as well as idely patent portal vein, splenic vein, and superior mesenteric veins.
He had an anemia workup which was unremarkable with a normal serum Folate, B12, TIBC, and transferrin on [**8-29**].
His hematocrit remained stable in the 27 to 33 range throughout his hospitalization.
After thorough discussion of risks and benefits, the patient underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 57094**]-renal shunt for treatment of severe portal hypertension on [**2138-9-5**].
He had a venogram study on post-operative day 5 which demonstrated no shunt stenosis, with pressures of 31 mmHg in the splenic vein, 25 mmHg in the renal vein, and 15 mmHg in the IVC.
