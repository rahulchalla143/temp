IMAGING: [**2-27**] CT Head: No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage.
[**2-27**] CXR PA and lateral: No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
[**3-2**] CXR Portable:  In comparison with the study of [**2-28**], focal areas of opacification adjacent to the aortic arch, in the left lower lung zone and at the right base.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-7-15**], regional left ventricular hypokinesis is now identified (and the severity of mitral regurgitation is not as well characterized).
Evaluation of distal pulmonary artery branches is limited by respiratory motion artifact.
Reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins suggestive of right- sided heart failure.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2162-7-13**] heart rate is faster.
In the ED, he was evaluated with EKG, CXR, CT head, and labs.
He O2 sat was found to be in the mid 80s on room air and he was tachypneic to the mid 30's; oxygenation improved to 96% on NRB with abg of 7.38/45/81.
CXR from [**3-2**] was not significantly different from admission with fluffy basilar predominant infiltrates.
His influenza course was thought to be superimposed with a bacterial pneumonia, as he had persistent temperatures, respiratory distress and worsening infiltrates on CXR .
SPEECH and SWALLOW EVALUATION: Although he was admitted on a regular PO diet, Mr. [**Known lastname 6352**] failed a speech and swallow evaluation and was made NPO.
Head CT on admission was negative for an acute process.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Influenza Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable-- satting in the mid- to upper 90's on 3 - 4 L NC; breathing comfortably; has an NG tube for feeding.
