ROS was positive for 10lb weight loss.
Outpatient lyme and flu were sent and were negative.
In the [**Location (un) 620**] ER, initial vital signs were 103.1, 100, 108/70, 18 and 95% room air.
She received 5 liters of normal saline with approximately 500 mL of urine output.
CXR was performed and revealed an RLL and she received Robitussin AC and Levaquin 750 mg IV.
While in the ER, her saturation dropped to 91% on room air and with supplemental 2 liters of oxygen it came up to 96%.
Initial laboratory eval was notable for pancytopenia, with 18% bands and 65% neutrophils.
ESR was 14, CRP was 108.
Hospital course:  CT chest was performed revealing extensive dense consolidation predominantly involving the right lower lobe and in decreasing order of severity at the left lower lobe, and left upper lobe.
Blood cultures from the ER eventually returned 3/4 bottles Staph Epi, pan sensitive which cleared on HD#2.
No further surveilance cultures were performed.
ID recomended echocardiogram which is being preliminarily read as ?mitral valve endocarditis.
On the day of transfer creatinine was noted to be 2.4 from 0.7 3 days after CTA and RTC ibuprofen.
Per report urine output remained "good."

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal.
IMPRESSION: Normal valve morphology without echo evidence of discrete vegetation/abscess or pathology flow.
CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pre-existing pleural effusions has slightly decreased but parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms are still visible at both lung bases.

She was initially started on vanc/ceftriaxone/azithro for empiric coverage, however this was changed to vanc/cefepime/cipro when sputum cultures from [**Location (un) 620**] grew pseudoamonas florescans.
All cultures here have been negative to date.
All cultures from bronch are negative to date as well.
She had a TTE at [**Location (un) 620**] which suggested a vegetation on the chordae of the mitral valve.
However, repeat TEE here not c/w endocarditis.
All cultures here have been negative.
# Acute Renal Failure: Pt had sudden increase in creatinine from baseline 0.6 to 2.5 prior to transfer here.
Creatinine continued to increase for several days before trending down.
Her urine output remained good, 50-75cc/hr.
Her Cr trended down by discharge.
# Anemia, NOS: Pt was noted to have hct decrease from 39 to 32 on admission, likely hemodilutional in setting of fluid resuscitation and possible marrow suppresion from infection.
# Liver lesions incidentally noted on CT chest: likely simple cysts given hounsfield units similar to water, however her LFTs remain midly elevated.
Pt should have  outpatient work-up for etiology of elevated LFTs and liver lesions with imaging once her renal function recovers.

Your kidneys were also injured during your illness and will need close monitoring to ensure proper recovery.
Once your kidneys recover, we recommend CT scan to further evaluate.
