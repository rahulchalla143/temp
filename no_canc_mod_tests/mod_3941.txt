Blood pressure 140/80.
Nausea, sob EKG NS 60, Right axis.
In ED cardiac enzymes drawn with troponin to 1.88.
Renal failure, status post renal transplant in [**2185**], baseline creatinine around 2.5.

[**1-20**]- EKG unchanged from prior (same STE in v1 and AVR and diffuse ST depression elsewhile.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2200-1-20**] 12:13 PM Stable radiograph with no convincing radiographic evidence of acute superimposed disease.
REST MIBI  [**2200-1-20**] INTERPRETATION: Following injection of MIBI while patient was at rest and experiencing chest pain, static and gated SPECT images were obtained and analyzed.
A bull's-eye display of tracer distribution throughout the myocardium was also obtained.
Imaging Protocol: This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
Rest images show some irregular tracer uptake in the ventricular walls.
IMPRESSION: Diagnostically uninterpretable study due to artifacts from significant softtissue attenuation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2200-1-20**] 5:24 AM No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
IMPRESSION: Although low lung volumes when compared to previous radiograph which can produce vascular crowding, increased vascular markings with cephalization identified consistent with mild CHF.
Her trop was 1.88 (Bl <.01) and Cr 3, consistent with NSTEMI.
Head CT and LENIs negative.
On the floor, troponin peaked on [**1-21**] at 2.65 and then trended down, now to 1.53.
Glucose unable to be controlled and patient sent to the MICU for insulin gtt with concern for impending DKA.
Creatinine rose to 3.3 from baseline 2.4 day two of admission to 2.7 [**1-22**].
DC'd HCTZ, and decreased BB to 50 [**Hospital1 **] given episodes of hypotension day 1 of admission.
Patient was scheduled for discharge when her glucose levels were noted to be uncontrollable with SQ insulin and [**Last Name (un) **] recommended an insuling gtt.
Her specific dosing was glargine 25 units [**Hospital1 **], Apidra, and new carb ratio for her insulin.
Clonidine 0.3 mg/24 hr Patch 2xwk 15.
A cath was not performed given your elevated creatinine.
It was also quite difficult to manage your blood glucose levels while in the hospital.
You should follow up with the [**Hospital **] clinic to ensure that your sugars continue to be controlled.
