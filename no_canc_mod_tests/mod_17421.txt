It has an abrupt onset and may be due to:  A blood clot that dislodges from your heart and travels through your bloodstream (emboli) to block an artery leading to your intestines, usually the superior mesenteric artery.
A blood clot that develops within one of the main intestinal arteries (thrombosis) and blocks blood flow, often as a result of atherosclerosis.
Impaired blood flow resulting from low blood pressure due to shock or heart failure.
A potentially dangerous complication of chronic mesenteric ischemia is the development of a blood clot within a diseased artery, causing acute mesenteric ischemia.
A blood clot in a mesenteric vein may result from:  Acute or chronic inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) Abdominal infection Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) Cancers of the digestive system Bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or diverticulitis Disorders that make your blood more prone to clotting (hypercoagulation disorders), such as an inherited protein deficiency Trauma to the abdomen Hormone therapy, which can cause a blood clot  Risk factors:  Many of the risk factors for intestinal ischemia are those associated with atherosclerosis and clogging of the mesenteric arteries.
These factors include:  Age (older than 50) High blood pressure (hypertension) Diabetes Elevated levels of blood lipids or fats Smoking Your risk is also higher if you have a history of atherosclerosis that affects blood flow in other areas of your body, such as your heart (coronary artery disease), legs (peripheral vascular disease) or the arteries serving your brain (cerebrovascular disease).
