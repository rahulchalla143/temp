Repeat Abd/pelvis CT [**2150-10-12**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Interval development of a large 11 x 15 x 17 cm right groin hematoma status post cardiac catheterization and sheath removal.
Multiple bilateral low-density renal foci are incompletely characterized on this non-contrast examination .
CXR [**2150-10-11**]: There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, with mild unfolding of the aorta.
Echo ([**2150-10-13**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Cardiac cath ([**2150-10-12**]) COMMENTS:     1.
Coronary angiography in this left-dominant system demonstrated no angiographically significant disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated systemic arterial pressures of 218 mmHg at systole and 105 mmHg at diastole.
Cardiac catheterization was uneventful, but the patient developed a right groin hematoma noted after discontinuation of the arterial sheath.
1) Hypertensive emergency: She developed hypertensive emergency at the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with BP 200/100, that was not responsive to nitroglycerin, morphine, and hydralazine.
Echo showed nl EF>55%, and no global or regional wall motion abnormalies.
We controlled her blood pressure as outlined above, and sublingual nitroglycerin for symptomatic chest pain, which she didn't have any after cath.
She was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] on [**10-21**] to have her JP drain pulled out in the vascular surgery clinic.
5) ARF: patient had a mild jump of Cr post cath (prior 1.1), now 1.4 and 1.5, urine lytes sent Urine Na 16, cr 107; Fena 0.17 and FeUrea 9.89% c/w pre-renal; she received mild IV hydration, and her Cr was back to baseline.
She received one unt of pRBC during hematoma evacuation op, and her Hct remained stable.
7) Type II DM:  Continued NPH 70/30, however titrated down to a lower dose 15 Units [**Hospital1 **] (when patient was NPO and on clear liquid diet) and ISS, fingersticks QID; checked HA1c which is 7.3 on [**2150-10-14**]; .
