In the ED, she presented with O2 sat 98% on 2L, but became hypoxic to 88% on 2L, with elevated blood pressure, and trop of 0.06 without EKG changes.
Her blood pressure and hypoxia improved with SL nitro and a 100% NRB.
CXR showed left pleural effusion.
CT chest without contrast showed no mass or underlying PNA.

CHEST CT: 1.
Given the patient's chronic renal insufficiency, which precludes the use of iodinated intravenous contrast with CT imaging, further evaluation is recommended by thoracic aortic MRA.
No evidence of a mass, although evaluation of the hila is limited.
Echo [**1-23**] unchanged EF 50%.
Effusion was believed to be transudative based on previous tap albumin, T prot, and no malignant cells (although no concurrent bloodwork was done to get true light's criteria).
Differential includes nephrotic syndrome, protein losing enteropathy, heart failure (cardiomyopathy and MR), renal failure, pulmonary embolism (although INR supratherapeutic); exudative causes include malignancy, lupus, pneumonia.
Since patient was no longer symptomatic by time of transfer to the floor and INR still above 2, decision made to do thoracentesis next week as outpatient.
Per renal recs, ACE-I stopped and patient started on isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine for afterload reduction.
# Cardiomyopathy: EF 50-55% combination of valvular disease from 2+MR/?ischemic disease, no known h/o CAD, though significant vasculopath.
Echo shows no change in EF.
Otherwise, blood pressure control.
# FEN: Passed speech and swallow eval on [**1-24**].
