The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
[**2109-9-2**] Chest CT Scan: 1.
Dense atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta, proximal bilateral renal arteries and celiac trunk.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed 2 vessel disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 20 mmHg and LVEDP of 35 mmHg.
There was severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 50 mmHg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.45 cm2.
Left ventriculography revealed 1+ mitral regurgitation.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
The EP and cardiac surgical services were consulted and further evaluation was performed.
Additional cardiac surgical workup included echocardiogram, cardiac catheteterization, chest CT scan, carotid ultrasound and viability study - please see result section for details.
Given her aortic valve disease, she was cleared by the dental service after clinical and radiographic examinations found no evidence of infection.
In summary the patient had AVR(#23 [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine)CABGx2(LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM),bypass time was 93 minwith crossclamp 67 min.
