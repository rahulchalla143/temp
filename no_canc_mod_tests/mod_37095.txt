[**2179-7-17**] CTA: CT OF THE CHEST: The visualized lungs show trace bibasilar atelectasis, but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
[**2179-7-17**] CT Abd/Pelvis: ABDOMEN: The visualized lung bases demonstrate minimal dependent atelectasis.
Contrast is being excreted from the kidneys related to the earlier contrast-enhanced CT the patient received but otherwise the kidneys appear normal.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year-old female with a history of recurrent DVT/PE, RCA dissection during cardiac catheterization [**3-/2179**] s/p BMSx6 presenting as transfer from OSH with chest pain, now resolved, later abdominal pain and hypotension NOS.
Hypotension/chest pain: Upon admission, blood pressure was as low as 70/40, responsive to 6L NS in ED.
She was transferred to the MICU for blood pressure monitoring without need for peripheral pressors, and was transferred to floor on HD#2.
CTA negative for PE, LENI negative for DVT, CT abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of acute process.
Bedside FAST exam in ED did not show any evidence of pericardial effusion or intra-abdominal bleeding.
TTE compared with prior from [**5-/2179**] demonstrated moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, RA enlargement, and LV hypokinesia, which were consistent with previous findings.
UA/USed without indication of infection; blood cultures still pending at time of admission.
Abdomen/pelvis CT scan showed no evidence of infection or diverticulitis.
Dissociative identity disorder/anxiety: Patient endorsed baseline levels of anxiety and denied SI/HI, feels safe at home.
Pending blood cultures [**2179-7-17**]  Medications on Admission: home: - Plavix 75mg daily - SL NTG 0.4mg PRN - ASA 325mg daily - Metoprolol ER 25mg - Lasix 60mg daily - Ativan 1mg QHS - KCl 10mEq daily - Fluoxetine 60mg daily - Zantac 150mg daily .
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] intensive care unit from [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation of low blood pressure after you experienced chest pain and abdominal pain.
You were then transferred to the medicine floor, where your blood pressure remained stable without getting additional fluid through your veins.
You had imaging of your lungs (CTA) to evaluate for a blood clot in your lungs, which was negative.
