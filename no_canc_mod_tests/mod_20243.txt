Her saturations were okay.
She additionally had dropped her systolic blood pressure into the 90s at the outside facility from an admission blood pressure in the 130s, and was found to have a hematocrit of 22.
Initial trauma survey revealed crepitus in the left chest and decreased breath sounds necessitating insertion of a left chest tube.
Chest x-ray had confirmed that she had a large left-sided effusion and multiple rib fractures with no obvious pneumothorax.
Her CT of the head was otherwise unremarkable.
Her CT of the chest revealed a large left hemothorax with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Additionally, the scan of the chest revealed a right distal clavicular fracture and left scapular fracture.
Her CT of the neck was unremarkable.
Her CT of the head was negative.
CT of abdomen with intravenous contrast on initial survey additionally showed no evidence of parenchymal or abdominal visceral injury.
Her admission examination was notable for a temperature of 95.3 rectally, heart rate of 107, sinus tachycardia.
Her blood pressure is 104/39, the respiratory rate of 14, and saturating 100% and vented.
Her left chest had some mild crepitus, but there was no evidence of instability or flail segment.
The rectal examination had loose tone, guaiac negative, no masses.
Her flanks and back were otherwise normal without obvious deformity or injury.
Her extremities showed no obvious deformity.
The patient was profoundly acidotic and dropped her hematocrit to 26.
Upright chest x-ray had been repeated showing no evidence of intraabdominal free air.
She had a transthoracic echocardiogram by the oncall Cardiology fellow that night of injury revealing a hyperdynamic left ventricular function with an EF greater than 75%, a normal RV systolic function, no mitral regurgitation, no evidence of pericardial effusion.
Due to the fact that the patient had initial survey on abdominal CT showing no evidence of visceral injury and the rapidly progressing abdominal distention with acidosis and somewhat collapsed IVC, it was thought that the patient may in fact be suffering from an abdominal compartment syndrome.
She only had 100 cc estimated blood loss during this procedure.
Received 1200 cc of intravenous fluids and urine output was 700 cc for the case.
There was no obvious persistent pneumothorax, however, as her daily chest x-ray evaluation confirmed this with a left chest tube being repositioned.
Therefore the patient had a speech and swallow evaluation, and at the time of this discharge summary, the final report of the speech and swallow evaluation was indeterminate.
However, if she failed her speech and swallow evaluation, she will likely need a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube for feeding access and then a repeat speech and swallow evaluation as an outpatient can be performed in a couple of weeks when her aspiration risk was reduced, and that her mental status has improved.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS BY SYSTEM:  Neurologically:  She had a negative head CT and negative CT C spine.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence pneumothorax.
This can be titrated as needed to control her blood pressure and heart rate.
She did not have any specific parameters, however, it would be nice to keep her systolic pressures at least under 160 with a heart rate in the 70-80 range.
Her transthoracic echocardiogram results were stated on the night of admission.
Her electrolytes were otherwise stable.
Her sputum was somewhat tan colored in nature, but ultimately it was not felt that she was suffering from a ventilator-associated pneumonia.
She had a hematocrit of 28.6 and a white count was 7.8 on [**2178-4-29**] with a normal platelet count of 407.
She should be placed on a NPH regimen and tighten her sliding scales for normoglycemia with goal blood sugars of 120-140 can be achieved.
GU/renal:  She had a Foley catheter for urine output monitoring.
Her creatinine was 0.5 on [**2178-4-29**] with a BUN of 23.
TREATMENTS AND FREQUENCIES:  She will continue on aggressive enteral feeding regimen her speech and swallow evaluation will proceed.
Her blood pressure control is as stated above.
Additionally, she should continue aggressive Physical Therapy, be out of bed, get a chest physiotherapy and incentive spirometry, and trach care as standard fashion.
