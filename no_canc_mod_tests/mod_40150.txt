FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2164-8-30**]):    NO GROWTH.
IMAGING [**2164-8-22**]: CT Head without contrast: FINDINGS: Encephalomalacic changes are present in the right parietal and occipital lobes in the right MCA and PCA territories.
[**2164-8-22**]: Chest Radiograph: FINDINGS: AP supine portable chest radiograph is obtained.
Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovasculature, and no definite sign of pneumonia or CHF.
The background rhythm demonstrated an 8 Hz maximal posterior predominant alpha rhythm intermixed with theta and delta likely related to a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
[**2164-8-26**]: CT Head Without Contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2164-8-23**] the ventricular response has slowed.
Cardiac monitor continues to be abnormal.
While in the ED of an OSH and en route to a CT scanner, his jaw clenched and he reportedly had a convulsive seizure.
He was sedated and intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
He had no lateralizing signs on his neurologic exam, and an EEG on [**8-23**] showed no seizure activity but did show intermittent left frontal and temporal sharp waves and intermittent diffuse slowing of the background rhythm.
LTM showed no seizures and it was stopped.
He subsequently had a NC MRI Brain on [**8-23**] which showed a left occipital-temporal ischemic stroke.
He is to be maintained at a goal INR of [**2-16**].
Currently his INR is 4.4 and please hold his warfarin until his INR is 2.
His diltiazem was increased to 90mg po qid and metoprolol was increased to 25mg po bid.
The patient's heart rate remained primarily in the 80s on this regimen.
[] Hyperglycemia - While on the steroids for his gout flare, his blood sugars have been high.
20. warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Please hold until INR is less than 2.
Goal INR [**2-16**].
Metoprolol Tartrate 5 mg IV Q8H:PRN tachycardia > 120 hold if SBP<120.
You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of your shaking and confusion episodes.
Your goal INR is [**2-16**].
Please restart taking 2mg by mouth at night once the INR is 2.
