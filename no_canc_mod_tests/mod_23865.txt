Four days prior to admission, patient presented to her outpatient primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], who advised an outpatient CT abdomen which revealed transverse colitis, so she was started on oral Cipro.
Of note, the patient had an extensive GI workup in HS that ruled out celiac and lead to a presumptive diagnosis of IBS.
CXR was wnl.
CT abdomen again revealed transverse colitis with associated LAD.
Exam revealed TTP diffusely, and was guaiac negative.
UCG was negative and lactate was 1.1.
Pelvic exam was performed and was reportedly normal, with GC and chlamydia sent.
Patient was initially going to the floor, but dropped to SBP 80s and only improved to 88/40 with fluid resuscitation.
Workup was negative -ADD   Social History: Lives in [**Hospital1 1281**] square in [**Location (un) 21601**].

If no evidence of Crohn's disease/inflammatory bowel disease, suggest repeat CT in [**4-8**] months to assess for interval change of the lymph nodes.
Colonoscopy Impression [**2186-8-2**]:Stool in the transverse colon, ascending colon and cecum;;Erythema and congestion in the colon;v Normal mucosa in the colon; Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum  Endoscopy Impression [**2186-8-2**]: Erythema, congestion and erosion in the antrum; Coffee-ground blood in the stomach;Ulcer in the pylorus (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Biopsies: SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: GI BX ( 3 JARS) [**2186-8-2**]  DIAGNOSIS:  A.  Gastric ulcer biopsy:  Focal chronic active gastritis with erosion and a cluster of macrophages suggestive of poorly formed granuloma.
A variety of tests were performed.
GC and Chlmydia labs were negative.
She was initially treated with Cipro/Flagyl, but this was stopped when C.diff, O+P, and all other infectious stool studies were negative and IBD became presumed diagnosis.
Upper endoscopy showed erythema, congestion and erosion in the antrum,Coffee-ground blood in the stomach,Ulcer in the pylorus (biopsy),Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.
Biopsies showed Focal chronic active gastritis with erosion and a cluster of macrophages suggestive of poorly formed granuloma with H.pylori stain pending, focal active ileitis and focal chronic active colitis.
CK 41, ESR 110. .
Patient given at least 6 L IVF in the ED/ICU and remained with BP in the 90s.
Patient continued to have systolic blood pressures in 80s throughout hospitalization without symptoms.
Admission HCT was 33.7, lowest HCT was 24.7, discharge 27.
Of note, iron, ferritin and TIBC were all low, TSH was normal.
You were initially sent to the ICU because your blood pressure was low.
Your blood pressure increased slightly and you remained stable and so it was determined that your blood pressure is likely low at baseline.
You had a flexible sigmoidoscopy that showed inflammation in your colon and you had an endoscopy which showed an ulcer.
The studies did not see any active bleeding but did reveal stool with blood (melena) which indicates that you did bleed at some point, likely from your ulcer.
The GI team found that these studies were likely consistent with Crohns disease (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) and the biopsies that they took confirmed this.
Of note, your hematocrit (blood levels) were low while you were here.
We continued to follow your hematocrit here and it remained stable upon discharge.
