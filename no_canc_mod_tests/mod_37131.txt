On the day of admission, he was still not returning phone calls and a Baycove employee went to check in on him at his apartment.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 85.1 (forehead) HR 53  BP 127/75  RR 29  O2sat 96%NRB.
Initial ABG was 6.98/98/156 and he was intubated at which time BP reportedly dropped to 50s systolic and he was transiently on pressors, until BP quickly returned to that of presentation.
A CXR was performed which showed diffuse bilateral haziness c/w pulmonary edema w/o clear e/o infiltrate.
A head CT was ordered, but they were unable to perform as he became bradycardic requiring atropine.
Additionally at that time his blood pressures again dipped to 50s-60s systolic and he was started on levophed; dopamine was added.
Additionally, creatinine was elevated to 5.2 (BL most recently [**12-27**]).
Potassium was 6.8 although hemolyzed and repeat was 5.6.

STUDIES: ======== EKG [**2139-11-11**] Sinus rhythm with prolonged P-R interval at approximately 280 milliseconds.
Compared to previous tracing of [**2139-4-27**] multiple abnormalities as noted persist without major change.
TRACING #1  EKG [**2139-11-11**] Sinus bradycardia.
TRACING #2  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2139-11-11**] FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled" "upright at 12:10 hours" is compared with study dated [**2139-6-22**].
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-11-12**] IMPRESSION: 1.
EEG [**2139-11-12**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the frequent spike  and sharp wave discharges seen in the frontal regions bilaterally and over the central midline.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2139-11-12**] The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared to the last study (images reviewed) of [**2139-8-13**], the findings are similar.
EEG [**2139-11-13**] IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured two sitter pushbuttons for unclear reasons which were not associated with any significant change on the patient's EEG or any significant change in the patient's appearance on video.
No electrographic seizures were seen; however, interictal epileptiform discharges were seen independently from both hemispheres and from the bifrontal region simultaneously at times, but these never progressed to [**Hospital1 2824**] electrographic seizures.
EEG [**2139-11-14**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
EEG [**2139-11-15**] IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal 24 hour video EEG telemetry in the waking and sleeping states due to the bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing.
ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) LEFT  [**2139-12-29**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Although serum and urine tox were negative for illicits, there is the possibility of overdose on psychiatric medication.
Head CT was negative for acute process.
The patient's respiratory status rapidly improved on the floor, and he was oxygen saturation was in the mid-90's on room air.
Renal was reconsulted for evaluation of worsening renal status, chronic kidney disease.
Head CT negative and EEG without seizure activity.
Cardiac etiology was also a possibility given increased CEs and new pulmonary edema (no EKG changes).
Echo was unchanged without new wall motion abnormalities.
Cortisol stimulation test was not suggestive of adrenal insufficiency.
The patient's BP was stable on clonidine patch, metoprolol, and amlodipine.
Ankle film showed degenerative changes without fracture.
# Herpes zoster: The patient was noted to have a herpetic rash on right shoulder, which was culture positive for herpes zoster.
