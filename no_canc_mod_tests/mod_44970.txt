I just received a phone call from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that [**Known firstname 7631**] bilirubin today is 13.7.
Since this test was done on an outpatient specimen which was sent to a third-party laboratory, it was unclear whether this result represented laboratory artifact or the true presence of metabolic acidosis.
According to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the quantity of specimen did not allow serum electrolytes to be done.
These included being sent to the [**Hospital3 7632**] Emergency Room for evaluation and repeat of laboratory testing with subsequent admission to [**Hospital3 7632**] or to the [**Hospital1 536**] Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for retesting and subsequent admission if need be based on the results of testing.
A third option emerged was evaluation at the [**Hospital6 7633**].
In a recent phone call to the parents, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with them, have created a plan that repeated laboratory testing would be done here at [**Hospital1 960**] and if abnormalities were to be noted that [**Known lastname **] would be transferred to [**Hospital6 7633**].
I re-iterated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that [**Hospital1 536**] was available to provide this evaluation and subsequent care.
She was to attempt to contact the father on his cell phone to discuss having the evaluation and treatment at one institution but is unable to contact him.
