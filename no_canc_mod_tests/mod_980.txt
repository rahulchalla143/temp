HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old Jamaican female with a history of lymphocytic pleocytosis of unknown etiology, a seizure disorder, a history of herpes encephalitis that was treated empirically (although never diagnosed as herpes encephalitis), hypertension and a suprasellar mass noted on CT scan in [**2125-9-15**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile and vital signs were stable.
On HEENT examination, the head was normocephalic and atraumatic.
The pulmonary examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
The cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 5700, hemoglobin of 12.9, hematocrit of 36.8 and platelet count of 294,000.
Urine specific gravity was 1.003.
There was a serum sodium of 141, potassium of 3.4, chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 27, BUN of 4, creatinine of 1.0 and glucose of 109.
Troponin was less than 0.3.
Calcium was 10.4, magnesium was 2.1 and phosphorus was 1.7.
Dilantin level was 14.9.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-8-15**], the widespread T wave inversions were new.
A stress test thereafter showed no angina with an uninterpretable electrocardiogram.
RADIOLOGY DATA:  An MRI of the head showed the base of the third ventricle a suprasellar mass with associated foci of increased intensity on the flare sequences within both cerebral hemispheres, primarily in the periventricular location, possibly consistent with sarcoidosis and probably not consistent with herpes encephalitis.
On [**2125-10-9**], an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed for nausea and vomiting; this test was negative.
On [**2125-10-11**], a lumbar puncture was performed and cytology was sent.
The white blood cell count was noted to be 233 with a glucose of 181 and a protein of 41.
The patient continued to complain of headache; however, her neurological examination was nonfocal.
for a sodium greater than 140.
DDAVP was continued until discharge for sodium greater than 140 to 145 and a urine output of greater than 300 to 400 cc per hour.
A biopsy of the patient's suprasellar mass was scheduled for [**2125-10-18**].
The patient was given fresh frozen plasma for an INR of 1.4 before that time.
The biopsy was performed on [**2125-10-18**].
The histology of the biopsy suggested a diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis.
However, this diagnosis was not 100% sure and a PPD was placed.
The PPD was read as 10 mm, which was unchanged from the PPD that had been placed in [**2125-1-15**].
The patient received pulse steroids with 1 gm of Solu-Medrol each day for three days beginning on [**2125-10-27**] for treatment of her neurosarcoidosis.
for sodium of greater than 145 or urine output of greater than 300 to 400 cc per hour.
Regular insulin sliding scale:  for glucose of 0 to 60, give [**Location (un) 2452**] juice and 0 units; for 61 to 200, 0 units, for 201 to 250, three units subcutaneous; for 251 to 300, six units subcutaneous; for 301 to 350, nine units subcutaneous; and, for 351 and greater, 12 units subcutaneous; the patient has required this insulin for glucose intolerance from her steroids.
