Repeat Head CT [**2119-12-1**] 1.
MRA Head: Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation without stenosis, occlusion or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations  Non-contrast head CT [**2119-12-1**] 1.
Formal angiogram has not been performed in this case, with vascular imaging at this time relying on MRA.
Cholestatic enzymes were noted sometime after intubation and cessation of propofol which was attributed to tube feeds.
Abdominal ultrasound revealed normal appearances, supporting the hypothesis that cholestatic enzymes were secondary to tube feeds.
