She had an echocardiogram on [**11/2149**], which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65%, aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 42, severe MAC, one plus mitral regurgitation and trivial tricuspid regurgitation.
She also had a Persantine MIBI in [**11/2149**], which revealed mild ischemia of the apical segment of the inferior wall and a mild fixed defect of the apical segment of the anterior wall.
Most recently, an echocardiogram showed aortic gradient of 68, and left ventricular hypertrophy with good left ventricular function.
The patient was consequently referred for cardiac catheterization for further evaluation.
