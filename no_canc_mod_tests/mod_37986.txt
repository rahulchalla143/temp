I recommended a urine creatinine.
Femoral artery pressures, systolic 203 and diastolic 96, mean 134, heart rate 86.
The abdominal aorta showed mild moderate atherosclerosis.
The left extremity showed mild osteal left common iliac and left external iliac with severe disease with totally occluded internal iliac and probably occluded left common femoral with no runoff was done secondary to his chronic renal failure.

Post angio BUN 47, creatinine 4.0, hematocrit 39.6.
The patient had a P-MIBI done on [**2139-11-27**] which showed a moderately reversible inferior and infralateral wall defect and ejection fraction of 46%.
Hematocrit was 33.8, BUN 30, creatinine 3.2, potassium 4.8.
Bone scan was negative for osteomyelitis.
His blood cultures were no growth.
His ABGs on postoperative day #1 were 7.36, 34, 170, 120 minus 5.
Hematocrit was 29.9, BUN 23, creatinine 2.6, potassium 4.3, CO2 17.
