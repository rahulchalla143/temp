Cardiac index 1.8.
PA gram showed no PE.
An IABP was placed for support.

She was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
A TEE showed low LV outflow and minimal RV function.
A CT chest was performed and showed no PE.
Despite maximum doses of pressors, her SBP continued to drop along with her MAP.
Her lactate was originally 12.6 but continued to rise with a max of 22.4.
A CT of her abdomen at the OSH done without contrast showed suggestion of abscess/diverticulitis given fluid in the paracolic gutter.
While getting a CT chest to rule out PE, a CT abdomen/pelvis was also performed which did not show any suggestion of abscess or infection.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent as well.
Lyme titers were sent given her presentation of complete heart block and have subsequently returned as negative.
Around 1AM, her SBP dropped to about 40 with the IABP on.
THe telemetry showed only pacer spikes and the femoral pulses were faintly dopplerable.
