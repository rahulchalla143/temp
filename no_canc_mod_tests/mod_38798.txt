Na 119 at 4pm->121 at 6pm.
ADH mediated etiology is considered since serum Osm is 250, however, urine Osm is lower at 170, suggesting this is not ADH mediated, and perhaps more likely psychogenic polydipsia, esp in setting of recent large quantities of tea consumption and increased urination.
Na 121 right now and pt possibly has symptomtic hyponatremia possibly contributing to seizures/AMS, on 3% sodium drip at 40/hr.
