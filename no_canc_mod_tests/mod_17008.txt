She was taken to [**Last Name (un) 1724**], where a CT of the head was reported to be negative.
At the time of arrival in the ED, the patient's exam was consistent with an NIH stroke scale score of about 19 (2 for inability to answer loc questions, 2 for inability to follow loc commands, 1 for partial gaze palsy/left gaze preference, 1 for partial hemianopia, 2 for right facial palsy, 4 for left upper extremity plegia, 3 for no effort versus gravity in left lower extremity, 2 for severe aphasia, 2 for profound inattention to right side of space).
Pulmonary: coarse breath sounds to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.
does not seem to blink to threat consistently from right * III, IV, VI: Left gaze preference (just crosses midline with dolls) * VII: righ facial with grimace * VIII: Hearing intact to voice  Strength: * Left Upper Extremity:  able to lift at least versus gravity * Right Upper Extremity: plegic  * Left Lower Extremity:  able to lift at least versus gravity * Right Lower Extremity: withdraws minimally to nailbed pressure  Reflexes: * Babinski: left flexor, right mute with hint of extensor  Sensation: * Nailbed pressue: intact to sensation in all four limbs   Pertinent Results: [**2177-1-7**] 07:50PM   GLUCOSE-246* UREA N-16 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-3.4 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-29 ANION GAP-10 [**2177-1-7**] 07:50PM   estGFR-Using this [**2177-1-7**] 07:50PM   ASA-NEG ACETMNPHN-NEG bnzodzpn-NEG barbitrt-NEG tricyclic-NEG [**2177-1-7**] 07:50PM URINE  HOURS-RANDOM [**2177-1-7**] 07:50PM URINE  UHOLD-HOLD [**2177-1-7**] 07:50PM   WBC-9.2 RBC-4.11* HGB-10.8* HCT-32.7* MCV-80* MCH-26.4* MCHC-33.2 RDW-14.6 [**2177-1-7**] 07:50PM   PT-13.6* PTT-29.6 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2177-1-7**] 07:50PM   PLT COUNT-174  CT brain and CT perfusion on [**2177-1-7**]: HEAD CT: There is a dense left middle cerebral artery sign, most consistent with acute occlusion.
CT PERFUSION: There is increased mean transit time in the left MCA territory with a decreased blood volume as well as decreased blood flow consistent with acute infarction in the left MCA territory.
CT brain [**2177-1-11**]: FINDINGS: Similar large left MCA territory infarct with significant mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and stable subfalcine herniation.
Similar subfalcine herniation and 11 mm rightward shift of midline structures.
Several similar punctate foci of hyperdensity likely foci of hemorrhage   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 71524**] was admitted as a transfer from [**Hospital6 2561**] for care after a CTA showed an occlusion of the left M1 MCA.
An initial CT done at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] was read as negative.
Initial NIHSS at [**Hospital1 18**] was 19 and patient was administered IV tPA within the 3 hour window.
On examination she had a left gaze deviation, dense right hemiplegia and was globally aphasic.
TTE revealed an elongated left atrium but no intracardiac vegetations, ASDs or PFOs.
Successive CT brain scans showed increased edema of the left MCA infarct and increased subfalcine herniation to the right.
