She was discharged at her estimated dry weight of ~66-67kg.
She initially had a fever and leukocytosis, however work-up was unrevealing and empiric antibiotics were stopped shortly after admission.
EKG with some subtle ST changes in lateral leads.
On [**4-1**], she had blood sugars in the 400s and an evolving anion gap.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was called and recommended an insulin drip.
Her sugars began to stabilize and she was transitioned to a subcutaneous insulin regimen with the help of the [**Last Name (un) **] team.
Her outpatient endocrinologist was contact[**Name (NI) **], and the patient was instructed to contact her diabetes specialist within 24 hours after discharge and to carefully record her blood sugars.
Metoprolol was continued as blood pressures stabilized.

Work-up was unrevealing.
