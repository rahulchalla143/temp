He was subsequently given 50meq of bicarb and calcium gluconate 2mg for membrane stabilization, and started on an insulin drip and given 4L NS, with subsequent decrease of his glucose to 467 and then 215.
His potassium decreased to 4.8, but his lactate remained elevated at 4.9.
He was subsequently noted to have a systolic pressure to 75, thus a central line was started and he was given empiric vancomycin and zosyn due to his prior mild abdominal tenderness on exam.
