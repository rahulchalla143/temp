Initial ABG demonstrated 7.34/50/54.
A chest x-ray was concerning for CHF.
His serum K was noted to be elevated and he was treated with Ca, insulin, glucose and bicarb.
While on the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU service, the patient's [**Hospital3 **] cath films were obtained and reviewed by both interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery; he was not felt to be a candidate for revascularization.

LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the posterior wall and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle.
CXR ([**2138-8-2**]): 1.
CT C/A/P ([**2138-8-2**]) (PFI): Pulmonary edema, bilateral plueral effusions.
CT Head ([**2138-8-2**]) (PFI): No acute intracranial pathology; chronic small vessel ischemic changes; fluid in the nasopharynx likely due to intubation.
PFTs ([**4-14**]): Mild obstructive ventilatory defect.
The reduced FVC may be due to gas trapping but a coexisting restrictive defect cannot be excluded.
Compared to the prior study of [**2137-12-27**] the FVC has increased by 0.35 L (+16%).
Some ECG changes were noted on admission, likely due to pt's significant acidemia.
