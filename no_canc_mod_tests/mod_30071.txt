No significant change from the tracing of [**2195-9-26**].
Endoscopy: [**12-8**] colonoscopy: Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the stomach antrum (normal pathology)   Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old female with type II diabetes presents with nausea/vomiting/melena.
She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit, where she became hypotensive and  her HCT dropped to 23.
GI was consulted, who did not recommend repeat EGD, given recent EGD [**2195-11-24**] (see results section).
She remained stable until [**2195-12-6**], when she had bright red blood per rectum and a hematocrit drop to 25.
She underwent a bleeding scan, which was negative.
At the time of discharge, her hematocrit was stable at 29, despite re-initiation of Plavix.
She will follow-up with gastroenterology as an outpatient and have a repeat hematocrit checked within 1 week.
At time of discharge, her blood sugars were well-controlled on metformin alone.
4) UTI: The patient's urine culture grew >100k E. coli resistant to quinolones, sensitive to ceftriaxone.
5) Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count nadired at 84, rising to 133 at time of discharge.
Her platelet count should be monitored as an outpatient; if thrombocytopenia persists, an outpatient hematology consult may be considered at the discretion of her PCP.
6) h/o CVA: No embolic source had been identified during her prior admission, but she had been started on coumadin and Plavix, although her INR was only 1 on admission.
Her neurological exam remained stable, and she was restarted on Plavix as indicated above.
She will have a repeat hematocrit checked within 1 week; if she remains stable, her coumadin can be restarted by her PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] goal INR 2-2.5.
7) CAD: The patient's EKG showed lateral ST depressions on admissions, however cardiac enzymes were not consistent with active ischemia.
8) HTN: The patient's blood pressure remained labile.
