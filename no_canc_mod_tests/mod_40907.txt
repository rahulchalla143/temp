A blood gas done at rehab showed pH 7.52, CO2, 30, O2 76.
INR was 3.8 on coumadin which was held today.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.8 94 116/78 20 96%, RR ranging from 30s to 50s.
Physical exam was notable for mental status that was not responsive to voice but withdrawing to pain, 2+ reflexes, EOMI, PERRL.
Labs were signifcant for leukocytosis to 14, lactate 2.2, INR 5.5.
CT head showed no new ICH.
CTA chest showed decreased clot burden, new patchy infiltrates on left, stable opacities on the right.
VS prior to transfer were T: 101.4, 91, RR 50, BP: 114/60, 98% on trach mask.

CT Chest [**2176-12-8**] TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired 5-mm axial images of the chest were obtained prior to and following the uneventful administration of 100 cc of intravenous contrast.
Additional right and left oblique reconstructions were performed for further evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature.
A ventriculoperitoneal shunt transverses along the right chest wall (2:31).
Previously seen bilateral pulmonary emboli are no longer visualized to the subsegmental levels, although evaluation of the lower segmental and subsegmental branches is limited due to patient motion.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 84M with recent admission for SAH secondary to aneursym s/p coiling, intraventricular shunt, trach and PEG ([**Date range (1) 91301**]), and bilateral PEs (12/12-15/11) presenting from rehab with tachypnea and found to have pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration.
INR supratherapeutic on admission.
He was given 5 mg vitamin K to lower INR when it peaked at 7.
He was restarted on warfarin dose 2.5mg on [**2176-12-11**], and his INR on discharge was 2.3.
His INR should be monitored frequently while on metronidazole (see attached sheet).
On discharge his creatinine was 0.4.
Transitional issues: - INR should be monitored closely while on metronidazole (was supratherapeutic on admission and warfarin held, restarted [**12-11**]) - Would recheck WBC if respiratory status worsens, if increasing consider restarting levofloxacin - Should continue IV vanc/cefepime until [**12-18**], can d/c PICC once antibiotic course complete - Should continue PO metronidazole until 2 weeks after completing IV antibiotics for c diff infection - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neurosurgery) will contact patient as outpatient with results of MRI.
Calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) PO TID (3 times a day).
8. calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable [**Month/Day/Year **]: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO three times a day.
While you were here, your INR was elevated so your coumadin was held.
You should continue to have your INR level monitored regularly at your rehab facility.
You had an MRI of your brain, and you will hear from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] within the next few days regarding these results.
