If there remains concern for acute cholecystis, formal ultrasound would be recommended for further assessment.

Normal IVC diameter (<2.1cm) with >55% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (0-5mmHg).
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Based on [**2170**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is asymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**12-3**] years.
She also required several units of packed cells for falling hematocrit (lowest 22 on admission) in the setting of hemodynamic instability (most recent Hct 20 on [**5-24**]).
She underwent pelvic arteriogram because of gluteal hematoma and concern for active extravasation and decreasing hematocrit despite transfusions.
Neurology was consulted for the subdural hematoma, serial head CT scans and neurologic exams were followed and remained stable.
She will follow up in 1 month with Neurosurgery for repeat head CT scan.
There was an initial attempt at voiding trial and she was noted to retain >500 cc urine on bladder scan and therefore had the catheter replaced.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: 2.5 Tablets PO DAILY (Daily).
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): hold for SBP <110; HR <60.
Followup Instructions: Follow up in 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Trauma Surgery for evaluation of your gluteal hematoma.
Inform the office that you will need a repeat head CT scan for this appointment.
