CPK 22 on discharge.
Chest x-ray [**6-13**], stable cardiac enlargement, pulmonary parenchyma unchanged from prior examination.
Persantine [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 1608**] [**2170-6-21**], the patient denied arm, neck, back or chest discomfort, no ST segments were noted.
Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2170-6-18**], hemorrhage within the right gluteus muscle which tracked into the right lateral thigh.
Cardiac catheterization [**2170-6-26**], performed for positive Persantine [**Year (4 digits) 1608**], right posterior descending artery 90% stenosis, right posterior lateral 50% stenosis, left main 70% stenosis, proximal left anterior descending 90% stenosis, mid left anterior descending 40% stenosis, distal left anterior descending 100% stenosis, diagonal 1 100% stenosis, distal circumflex 100% stenosis, obtuse marginal 1 and 2 100% stenosis.
Cardiac catheterization [**2170-6-28**], left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending was patent and final report is pending.
Cardiac enzymes and electrocardiograms were cycled.
On hospital day #9 the patient underwent Persantine [**Year (4 digits) 1608**] showing reversible defects.
Hematology - Postoperatively the patient had a hematocrit of 26.7 in a setting of estimated blood loss of 1 liter.
The patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells with a post transfusion hematocrit of 28.6.
On postoperative day #3 the patient's hematocrit decreased to 25.5 in a setting of an INR of 4.4.
On postoperative day #4 the post transfusion hematocrit was 22.6 in the setting of an INR of 6.7.
On rectal examination the patient was guaiac negative.
Postoperative day #5 the patient's hematocrit was 29.7 with an INR of 1.8.
Computerized tomography scan was done to rule out a retroperitoneal bleed.
Computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
Chest x-ray was done and showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Blood cultures were done on postoperative day #1 and 3 which all showed no growth.
Urine cultures showed no growth as well.
