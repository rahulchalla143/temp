He was markedly hypertensive on arrival -- BP was recorded initially as 232/132 (VS otherwise unremarkable).
CBC and coags were normal (INR 0.9 and no known h/o A/C); BMP was pending.
ECG remarkable for obvious LVH (voltage criteria) and ?RBBB (RSR' in III), with NSR.
He arrived here around 21:30 with BP 267/131, down to 168/96 with increased nitroprusside gtt rate.
Nephrolithiasis 6.
Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2197-3-20**]: FINDINGS: Centered within the right cerebellum, there is a 5.4 x 3 cm hyperdense hemorrhage with surrounding edema (previously 2.8 x 3 cm); this hemorrhage crosses the cerebellar vermis into the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Hyperdense blood is seen layering within the occipital horns bilaterally.
[**3-21**] Head CT 1.
Interval occipital craniectomy with increased but residual hyperdense blood in the cerebellum and ventricles; evaluation of mass effect is suboptimal on this study due to portable technique.
[**3-24**] CT head IMPRESSION: 1.
Compared to the most recent prior study from [**2197-3-21**], unchanged amount of hemorrhage in the fourth ventricle and the cerebellar hemispheres.
CT head [**2197-3-25**] Overall stable examination without significant hydrocephalus in the setting of external ventricular drain.
CT head [**2197-3-26**] 1.
CT head [**2197-3-27**] Unchanged right cerebellar hemorrhage with intraventricular extension into the fourth ventricle.
CHest Xray [**3-31**]: PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours.
Lower Extremity Doppler Ultrasound [**2197-4-4**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either right or left lower extremity.
LENIS [**4-12**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
On post op exam he was not following commands but moved everything to noxious.
A head CT on the morning of [**3-21**] showed good evacuation of ICH and decreased hydrocephalus.
A CXR was consistent with worseing consolidation and empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated for for Ventilatory Aquired Pneumonia.
The WBC level was 17.2 from 14.8 on [**3-23**].
The External Ventricular Drain exhibited poor output of 4cc from 7-9am.
The EVD was distally/proximally flushed and the extrenal ventricular drain decreased to 10 and left open.
A NCHCT was performed which was consistent with good placement EVD and no hydrocephalas.
and a  Bronchcoscopy was performed at the bedside and a BAL was sent.
On [**3-25**], The patient's exam improved and he was able to follow some simple commands.
The External Ventricular Drain was discontinued as there was no drainage of CSF from the EVD and the patient's 4th ventircle was noted to be patent on head CT.
On [**3-26**], The patient neurological exam was improved and he was able to follow commands in all four extremities with full strength.
His EVD staples were removed.
On [**4-3**] his abdomen was found to be distended and post void bladder scan revealed 1000cc remaining in the bladder so a foley was replaced and the patient was started on Flomasx.
His creatinine bumped on [**4-4**] to 2.1 (baseline elevated > 1.3) likely due to mild dehydration as his oral intake was poor.
His labs were trended.
On [**4-6**] his creatinine decreased to 1.8, and we again attempted to remove his foley.
A stool sample was sent on [**4-11**] which was negative for Cdiff.
On [**4-12**] he remained stable and his creatinine was done to 1.7 from 2.0  [**4-13**] He was seen by OT and c/o dizziness - he vomited x 1 with ?
Labs and CT were ordered after reviewing OMR.
His CT was stable with no changes.
Nutrition was consulted and stool was sent for c-diff.
Stool O+P were sent, although discomfort is likely just due to history of + cdiff.
He had another repeat LENIs on [**5-13**] which showed no evidence of DVT.
A CT head was obtained on [**5-14**] which showed expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhages.
They continued to recommend a urodynamic study as an outpatient.

Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks with a Head CT w/o contrast.
