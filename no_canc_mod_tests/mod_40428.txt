In the ED, her initial vital signs were T not recorded HR 113 BP 230/112 38 100%NRB.
- Paroxysmal atrial flutter, s/p failed ablation with subsequent a. fib - Peptic ulcer disease - Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy - Mild mitral stenosis (MVA 1.5-2.0 cm2) - Secondary Hyperparathyroidism - Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure  Social History: Social history is significant for the presence of current tobacco use (1 pack per week), and [**12-22**] PPD x 50 years.
No asterixis PSYCH: appropriate affect  Pertinent Results: EKG [**2163-5-30**]:Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2163-5-13**] the ST-T wave changes are more prominent and may represent superimposed inferolateral ischemic process.
Renal U/S [**5-31**]: IMPRESSION: No solid renal masses identified.
[**2163-3-24**] TTE - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2163-5-31**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):   Brief Hospital Course: 73 year old woman with hx of diastolic CHF, DM2, ESRD on HD presenting with acute hypoxia and hypertensive urgency .
She does have hyperinflated lungs on CXR and was mildly bronchospastic on admission, so she was started on azithromycin, spireva, and albuterol nebs.
Cardiac enzymes x3 showed flat troponin at 0.04-0.05 and negative MBI so as not to suggest ischemic event.
CXR showed pulmonary edema and small effusions without clear evidence of infiltrate and she was without cough and fever.
UA was negative for infection.
COPD:  No formal diagnosis, however lungs markedly hyperinflated on CXR and with significant pack year history of tobacco use with continued use (although less so).
She was started on spireva and albuterol nebs as well as azithromycin and her exam improved markedly.
She presented with hct 51-->43.
Last HD/UF session was 3 days PTA so seemed unlikely all hemoconcentration; she did report poor PO however.
Renal U/S was negative for mass suggestive of erythropoietin producing mass.
An epo level was sent.
# Atrial fibrillation: She remained in NSR while in house and INR was therapeutic on presentation.
She was, however, quickly titrated off and post HD, SBPs were stable in the 120-140s range on metoprolol alone.
NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **].
BRIMONIDINE 0.15 % Drops - 1 Drops(s) in the right eye DAILY LATANOPROST  0.005 % Drops - 1 Drops(s) in the right eye HS   Discharge Medications: 1.
You were given a session of dialysis for which your breathing and blood pressure improved.
You should also resume having your INR checked for proper coumadin dosing as you were at dialysis sessions.
