CXR: [**2197-10-29**] Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are essentially unchanged since [**10-27**] but there is greater opacification in the left lower chest including more consolidation in the left lower lobe either atelectasis or pneumonia and increasing small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
Spine CT [**2197-11-1**] 1.
Patient has extensive history of smoking and CT chest prior to admission showed interstitial and empysematous changes suggesting possible COPD.
DDx also included acute on chronic diastolic heart failure exacerbation given elaveted JVP, peripheral edema, few crackles on lung exam and finding of interstial edema on CXR.
Based on prior chest CT, there were no findings suggestive of maligancy.
However, patient has an IV dye allergy that is described as serious and sounds like anaphylaxis therefore CT imaging was deferred.
Given his condition at the time of transfer, pleural effusion on x-ray, and restricted lung volumes, a V/Q scan was likely be of little utility.
Given that his MRSA screen was negative, he was then transitioned to levofloxacin for a total course of 7 days (last day [**2197-10-26**]).
There were no ischemic changes on EKG and troponins were negative.
TRANSITIONAL: # follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] in ortho on [**11-9**] at 10 am # titrate metformin for diabetes control # CT demonstrated breached screw through the superior endplate above the intervertebral disc of T9.
