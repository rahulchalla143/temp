CXR [**2106-7-10**]: CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
TTE [**2106-7-10**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
CT HEAD W/O [**2106-7-11**]: READ PENDING  EEG: 1.
No hemorrhage, CT evidence of infarct, or other acute process.
TTE demonstrated EF 20%, and hypokinesis suggestive of multi-vessel disease.
Cardiac enzymes were trended to peak.
Per last evaluation at [**Name (NI) 2025**], pt was seen by urology and ID who recommended no abx unless pyuria and sxs, given desire to not breed resistance.
Urine culture grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella.
RUQ u/s was done to further characterize, and again showed intra- and extra-hepatic dilatation but not clear mass or obstruction.
She required a dilt drip, which was dc'd when the patient was made CMO.
4. ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: Four (4) mg Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea/vomiting.
