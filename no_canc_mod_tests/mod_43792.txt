He received a total of 4 units of pRBCs (2 on [**3-30**] and 2 on [**4-3**]) with stable hematocrit and no further episodes of melena.
The GI team was consulted, and there was some concern that he might need to be intubated for the procedure given his history of interstitial lung disease (complicated by recent ARDS at OSH and high O2 requirement).
Ultimately, the patient and his HCP decided against an endoscopy with or without intubation.
His oxygen saturations improved with diuresis although he continued to require several liters of supplemental oxygen.
As mentioned above, his plavix was completely stopped but he was restarted on 81mg of aspirin daily prior to discharge.
You and your health care proxy decided to not have an endoscopy done to evaluate your GI tract, and the bleeding stopped with medications.
You can call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 32100**] for an appointment.
