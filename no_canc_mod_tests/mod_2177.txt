You had evaluation of your gallbladder which didn't show any problem or cause for infection.
You were found to have a blood clot at the site of your right dialysis line.
This may be the source of bacteria so your right side dialysis line was removed to help the blood clot dissolve.
You will need a repeat ultrasound to be sure that the clot does dissolve.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience any worrisome symptoms including light headedness, weakness, fevers, low blood pressure or other worrisome symptoms.
Followup Instructions: You have an appointment scheduled for an ultrasound of your right arm/neck to evaluate the blood clot that was seen.
