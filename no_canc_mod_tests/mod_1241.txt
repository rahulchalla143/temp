Admission Date:  [**2155-8-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2155-8-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2112-9-15**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 42-year-old white male with past medical history significant for alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis resulting in pancreatic insufficiency, and insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine of 4.0, chronic thrombocytopenia, who has a recent admission to the [**Hospital1 69**], who presented on [**2155-8-13**] with acute onset fatigue, worsening dyspnea on exertion, increased lower extremity edema, and decreased urine output x3 days.
Laboratories on admission were significant for a BUN-creatinine ratio of 58/8.6, a troponin-T of -.42 with a CK of 64, and a hematocrit on admission of 28 that dropped to 23.6 12 hours later.
Electrocardiogram was unchanged.
Rectal examination showed heme-negative stool.
Urine electrolytes were not consistent with a prerenal etiology of acute or on chronic renal failure, but of note, he had been getting Lasix at home.
Chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine of 4.0.
PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature of 96.3, blood pressure 116/70, heart rate 96, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 100% on 2 liters face mask.
Abdominal examination:  Positive bowel sounds, nontender, distended, positive fluid wave, liver and spleen not palpable.
PERTINENT LABORATORIES AND OTHER STUDIES:  Complete blood cell count showed white blood cell count 12.1 with differential of 71.6% neutrophils, 16.5% lymphocytes, 5.5% monocytes, 1.2% eosinophils, 0.6% basophils.
Hematocrit is 28.1, platelets 89.
Serum chemistries showed sodium 138, potassium 3.5, chloride 101, bicarbonate 13, BUN 56, creatinine 8.6 (creatinine was 3.9 on [**7-23**]), glucose 304.
ALT 23, AST 30, amylase 25, ALT 254, LDH 218, total bilirubin 0.9, albumin 1.8, total protein 6.4, lipase 5.
Coagulation profile showed a PT of 14.5, PTT 45.1, INR 1.4.
Alcohol level was 35.
Chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural effusions.
Urinalysis showed specific gravity of 1.010, large blood, negative nitrate.
Moderate leukocytes, [**12-11**] red blood cells, and greater than 50 white blood cells, 0 epithelial cells, and no bacteria.
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
The patient's BUN and creatinine continued to increase.
Initially, the plan was to diurese the patient or dialyze him if he became severely dyspneic and had chest x-ray evidence of fulminant failure.
It was felt that very possibly he had an acute coronary event a few days prior to admission leading to renal hypoperfusion, which might explain his acute renal decompensation.
Cardiac echocardiogram was obtained, which demonstrated a hyperdynamic ejection fraction greater than 75% and mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
He had a diagnostic tap on his previous admission in [**2155-6-22**] with no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
He underwent a therapeutic paracentesis on the afternoon of [**2155-8-15**] with removal of 2 liters of acidic fluid.
At the time of this dictation, culture results on that fluid were still pending.
He was therefore transfused 1 unit packed red blood cells.
His stool was checked for occult blood and was heme negative.
