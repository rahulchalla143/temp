In the ED she underwent a CT scan of her pelvis which showed mildly-comminuted R femoral subcapital fracture.
She was initially started on Vancomycin given her MRSA history and her joint was aspirated and notable for 36K WBC and 96% polys with rare growth of MSSA.
On [**3-31**] she had a cement Vancomycin/Tobramycin spacer placed in her right hip and femoral head resection.
- recommend continuing PO Vancomycin 250mg every 6 hours until 2 weeks after her last Daptomycin  ##.
Subsequent urine culture showed no bacterial growth.
During hospitalization pt did develop acute on chronic insufficiency from a combination of pre-renal and allergic interstitial nephritis (urine was positive for urine Eosinophils).
Cause of AIN not entirely clear though Ciprofloxacin was suspected, however Creatinine improved with intravenous fluid.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: 2.5 Tablets PO DAILY (Daily).
Vancomycin 250 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours): please continue for 2 additional weeks after last Daptomycin dose.
