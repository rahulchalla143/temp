Respiratory Depression: In an effort to further treat the patient's nausea and vomiting she was given 1mg of Ativan in the ED, shortly after which her respiratory rate decreased to [**3-24**] breaths per minute.
Her oxygen saturation fell to the mid-80s and she was admitted to the ICU.
Her BP initially improved to 180/110 but then came back up to 210/117.
Her blood pressures then came down but remained high throughout her hospitalization.
Hydralazine, 10mg, was also used intermittently to control peaks in her blood pressure.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable, near baseline, and she was never hemodynamically unstable.
Hematemesis was 1 witnessed episode x roughly 3-4 cc of bright red blood.
Her ASA 81mg for primary prevention was held and she was placed on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI x 6 weeks, to then change to a daily PPI thereafter.
As she had not been on erythromycin prior to this admission, we discontinued this drug on discharge, with instructions to discuss this with her GI physician at her [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] [**Name9 (PRE) 648**].
DM-I: This patient's blood sugars remained a focus of concern throughout her hospitalization.
Upon admission her sugars were as high as 450 and there was some initial concern about DKA.
Her sugars, however, came down with increased insulin coverage, and an insulin drip was never needed.
In addition, your long-acting insulin dose was increased during your stay, as was your sliding scale, because your blood sugars were high during much of your admission.
We have also made you an [**Last Name (STitle) 648**] with your GI physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 10689**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 463**]) on Wednesday [**6-18**] at 9 a.m. (Nurse Practitioner [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])
