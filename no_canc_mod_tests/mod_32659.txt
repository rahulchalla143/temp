His girlfriend denied associated tongue biting or urinary/fecal incontinence.
His girlfriend noted that he did drink 8 beers the night prior while watching the Super Bowl but that this was not unusual for him.
While in the ED, patient was noted to have another event similar to the one noted above, and was given Ativan IV to break the episode.
Shortly afterwards, he was also noted to have an SVT and given adenosine as well, and upon breaking the EKG was consistent with WPW with AVRT.
Patient also had an LP performed which was unremarkable, as well as a head CT.

FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2106-3-18**]):    NO GROWTH.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2106-3-15**] 1:46 PM FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass, shift of normally midline structures, edema, hydrocephalus or major vascular territorial infarct.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2106-3-16**] 9:14 AM MR BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS GADOLINIUM: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction.
TTE [**2106-3-16**]: Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
EEG Study Date of [**2106-3-17**] IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the occasional bursts of irregular slowing in the left temporal region and due to the single burst of sharp theta slowing.
The cardiac monitor showed an intermittently irregular rhythm.
Urine and serum tox screens negative, including a negative ETOH level.
Osmolal gap WNL (3.5).
- Neurology Consultation - EEG/MRI as above - Seizure precautions were used in house, but no further seizures - Keppra 1000 mg load, 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per neurology recommendations, until [**3-20**] then to 750 until [**3-25**] with 1000mg - toxicology consultation - Rhabdomyolysis presumably from seizure - Patient informed he can not drive for 6 months from last seizure.
- Post resolution of AVNRT noted with delta-waves and short PR interval - Monitored on telemetry, with episodes of bradycardia with WPW morphology - Repeat EKG with no changes - Planned ablation [**4-1**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - EP Consultation  Medications on Admission: none  Discharge Medications: 1.
You should not drink any alcohol, as this can start a seizure  You should not engage in activities which either a seizure or arrythmia could be dangerous such as sports, standing on heights.
