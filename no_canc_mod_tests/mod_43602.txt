Initial Head CT [**8-31**]: CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: The obtained images demonstrate an intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the inferior aspect of the right temporal lobe measuring approximately 4.2 x 3.2 cm.
Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended to rule out underlying vascular lesion or mass.
Repeat Head CT [**9-1**]: unchanged from admission CT  MRI not obtained  Brief Hospital Course: The event at home was felt to be a partial complex seizure with secondary generalization.
Head CT in the ED showed some evidence of hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe, around the area where he was known to have a cavernoma.
There were no deficits on initial Neuro exam except for subtle L nasolabial fold flattening.
Repeat Head CT the next morning showed no change in the hemorrhage, and his exam was again normal except for the NLF flattening.
MRI Head was not obtained.
