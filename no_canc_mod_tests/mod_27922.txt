), old sacral pinning CT head: negative C spine: negative CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: no fx's, no solid organ injury, s/p ostomy L arm: open, displaced distal radial/ulnar fxs L ankle: no fx   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the TSICU from the ED.
He was evaluated via physical exam and review of the images that were taken in the ED and found to have the following injuries: open L ulnar fracture/dislocation, and distal radial fracture L elbow dislocation old R pubic fractures new nondisplaced L inferior pubic ramus fracture bilateral old clavicle fractures R 8th rib fracture R pulmonary contusions and small effusion small R pneumothorax face and R flank lacerations  He was taken to the OR on [**2163-7-21**] for irrigation and debridement of the both fracture in the left arm, placement of an external fixator across the wrist and examination of the left elbow under anesthesia with confirmation of reduction.
On [**7-28**] L foot 2,3,4 metatarsal fractures with angulation of 4 were found on XRay.
He stopped putting out stool into his ostomy and by the morning of [**8-3**] CT revealed dilated loops of bowel, a tranistion point in the mid abdomen, no passage of contrast beyond this point, and compressed bowel in his pelvis with a transition.
These images along with his physical exam were consistent with SBO and he was taken to the OR on [**8-3**] for lysis of adhesions, closure of an internal space adjacent to the colostomy and repair of a lateral internal hernia.
