Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP 10mmHg and PCWP mean 6 mmHg.
The pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was high normal PASP 33mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.16 l/min/m2.
An intraortic balloon pump was placed sheathed via the right femoral artery, with systolic unloading from 173 mmHg to 171 mmHg and diastolic augmentation from 76 mmHg to 140 mmHg on [**11-17**] counterpulsation.
LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF guess = 40%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2153-1-2**] 10:11 AM Final Report HISTORY: CABG.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-29**], the right central catheter has been removed.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
