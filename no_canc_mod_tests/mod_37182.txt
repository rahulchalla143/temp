There are no strips available for review, but a shock was delivered, restoring NSR and a blood pressure of 130/80.
Labs were largely insignificant - he had a CPK 214, MB 5.5, Trop Ultra of 0.345.
No echo was performed @ [**Hospital3 3765**].

Cardiac Cath [**2133-10-9**]: 1.
Limted resting hemodynamics showed mildly elevated left ventriuclar filling pressures measured at 18 mmHg.
ECHO [**2133-10-10**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2133-10-13**] Cardiac MRI Structure and Function  There was normal epicardial fat distribution.
The left atrial AP dimension was normal.
The right and left atrial lengths in the 4-chamber view were normal.
The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index was normal.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 58% with normal regional systolic function.
The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal.
The left ventricular mass index was normal.
The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal.
The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 51%, with normal free wall motion.
Aortic flow demonstrated no significant aortic regurgitation.
The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated no significant tricuspid regurgitation.
Admission cardiac cath showed no CAD and ECHO WNL with LVEF >55%.
Baseline EKG with LVH and ST-T wave configuration consistent with early repolarization pattern, otherwise benign.
On morning of [**10-12**], pt described mild chest tightness, attributed to anxiety based on description of pain, unchanged EKG and recent normal cath.
Cardiac MRI was done and was normal.
An EP study done on [**10-13**] showed no evidence of abnormal conduction or inducable arrythmias.
On [**10-14**] an ICD was placed without any complications and pt was discharged to home on Toprol XL 25mg daily.
Pt scheduled to follow up with electrophysiology to discuss need for formal EP study and ask about need for any further EKG screening of family members  2) Cognitive Impairment: Pt had short term memory deficits that have improved steadily during course of admission, most likely secondary to hypoxia in setting of recent arrest.
Your left chest area will be sore but the soreness should improve every day.
Metoprolol Succinate: a beta blocker that slows your heart rate and may prevent a very rapid rhythm 3.
