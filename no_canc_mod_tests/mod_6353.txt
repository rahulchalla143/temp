[**1-14**] Abdominal ultrasound:IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI abdomen: IMPRESSION:  1.
Evaluation of hepatic arterial supply is limited due to non-breath-hold technique.
However, prior abdominal CT scans demonstrate conventional hepatic arterial anatomy.
Evaluation of the reformatted images on a separate workstation were valuable in delineating the anatomy.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 3 iv injections of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline, at rest, with cough and post-Valsalva maneuver.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Agitated saline contrast study demonstrated no significant intracardiac shunt at rest or with cough and Valsalva release (cannot definitively exclude).
INTERPRETATION: Image Protocol: Gated SPECT Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 78%.
LVEF of 78%.
# TIPS evaluation - Patient was initially admitted on [**2160-12-2**] to [**2160-12-26**] for potential TIPs eval due to recurrent variceal bleeding in [**11-24**] requiring banding.
Patient subsequently underwent TIPS on [**1-20**].
An MRI was also obtained outlining the liver size.
Patient also underwent cardiac MIBI that showed preserved EF with no reversible defects and no suggestion of CAD.
Patient was also positive for HSV 1 Ab, negative for HSV 2 Ab.
Patient was subsequently restarted on Lasix 40 mg QD and her spironolactone which was subsequently increased to 50 mg po QD.
Her CXR during this admission was also c/w mod pulmonary edema, probably due to aggressive volume resuscitation.
Patient also underwent pulmonary evaluation while in house.
ABG on room gas did reveal hypoxia of paO2 of 57, after long discussion it was decided that this close to her baseline due to her underlying restrictive lung disease.
Patient is to have her Cr checked weekly.
Her postprandial sugars are 110-140, with occasional values of 170.
