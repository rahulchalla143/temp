EKG OSH: Hr 100, normal axis, NSR, st elevation v1, v2, v3, v4., t wave inversion avl.
Cath [**2164-2-17**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Hemodynamic assessment showed elevated right and left sided filling pressures and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
TTE [**2164-2-18**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
LV ventriculography was deferred.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 22 mm Hg.
Her peak CK was 582.
She was continued on integrillin X36 hours post cath for persistent chest pain.
Angiography revealed a widely patent LAD stent.
TTE revealed  moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the distal half of the anterior wall and septum,, distal inferior wall and apex.
EF 30%.
Cardiac MR revealed a LV thrombus and the patient was discharged home on a Lovenox bridge and coumadin.
Cardiac MR was performed to evaluate the pericardium and on prelim read there was no evidence of pericarditis but concern for LV thrombus.
She will follow up with her PCP for INR checks as well as referral to a cardiologist for further management.
You should have your INR check on [**2-27**] and contact your PCP for further dosing.
You should follow up to have your INR checked on Monday [**2164-2-27**].
You should follow up to have your INR checked on Monday [**2164-2-27**].
