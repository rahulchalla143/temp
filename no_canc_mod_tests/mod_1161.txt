CT OF THE PELVIS:  Multiple soft-tissue attenuation masses are seen in the pelvis which appear to be contiguous with the uterus on this limited non-contrast study and likely represent fibroids.
Left kidney cyst and left adrenal gland thickening, unchanged.
Pelvic ultrasound [**2111-11-22**]- FINDINGS:  Transabdominal and transvaginal examinations were performed, the latter for better evaluation of the uterus and adnexa.
Doppler evaluation of the ovaries demonstrates no evidence of color flow or Doppler waveforms, which is thought to be artifactual given the normal appearance of the ovaries.
Given the difficulty in the evaluation for blood flow, pelvic MRI could be obtained if clinically indicated.
<br> <b>Other Labs:</b> TSH ([**1-3**]) - 6.2 Free T4 ([**1-3**]) - 1.2 ACE Level ([**1-3**]) - <1 SPEP ([**1-2**]) - negative UPEP ([**1-1**]) - no monoclona Ig, negative Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] Urine Protein/Cr ratio ([**1-1**]) - 3.5 Lipids ([**12-30**]) - Chol-158, TG-83, HDL-61, LDL-80 <br> <b>Micro Data:</b> Urine ([**1-8**]) - negative [**Month/Year (2) **] ([**1-7**]) - >25 polys, heavy growth oropharyngeal fora.

<br>  CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2112-1-7**] 12:48 PM FINDINGS: Two views of the chest were obtained.
There is mild fluid overload with vascular engorgement, slightly worse than the prior examination dated [**2112-1-4**].
<br>  CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2112-1-2**] 5:05 PM FINDINGS: TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST WERE OBTAINED.
<br> RENAL U.S.  [**2112-1-4**] 5:48 PM RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 10.8 cm, and the left kidney measures 9.7 cm.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images [**Month/Year (2) **]) of [**2110-12-22**], the left ventricular systolic function is somewhat improved.
METHOD:  Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
Stress images were obtained approximately 45 minutes following tracer injection.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 57% with an EDV of 69 ml.
Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function  Compared to the prior study of [**2110-12-19**], the prior lateral wall defect is no longer seen.
<br> CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2111-12-28**] 12:00 AM Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
She underwent an SPEP and UPEP which were negative.
She had an ACE level sent (for possible sarcoid), however this was undetectable (pt on ACE inhibitor therapy).
She is to follow up in the heart failure clinic and was sent home with careful electronic monitoring of weight and blood pressure.
She was maintained on coumadin with decrease of INR prior to discharge due to a decrease in her dose (secondary to hematuria).
# Hypertension Blood pressure varied as described above.
# Abdominal pain/[**Name (NI) 9532**] Unclear etiology, but evaulation in ER demonstrated no acute abdominal pathology on CT, and pelvic ultrasound showed only fibroid uterus with normal ovaries.
Urine Protein/Cr found to be 3.5 as above.
# acid-base disorder, mixed- anion gap of 19, with bicarb of 30 and hypochloremia.
likely anion gap [**3-20**] to mild lactic acidosis and uremia from renal insufficiency.
Blood sugars remained well controlled on dietary modification.
She was afebrile with normal WBC count and no evidence of infiltrate on her chest x-ray.
[**Hospital1 **] culture obtained showed oropharyngeal flora (initially).
# Outstanding Issues: -consider fat pad biopsy for amyloid -consider w/u for secondary causes of htn -monitor INR -monitor HR/BP/weight -monitor response to Fluoxetine -repeat UA to ensure no microscopic hematuria -consider BiPAP for OSA -H. Flu in [**Name (NI) **], consider therapy vs. repeating.
