Her fingerstick blood sugars had been consistently running under 120.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient had an ejection fraction of 20-25% by echocardiogram in [**2155-10-2**] with left ventricular hypokinesis, moderate mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of 97.2?????
?F, a heart rate of 86, a blood pressure of 171/86 in the left arm and 181/80 in the right arm, respirations of 14 per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, the pupils were equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.
Otherwise, the chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with a well healed sternotomy scar.
There was a well healed midline scar, apparently due to exploratory laparotomy, which eventually led to appendectomy.
The gastrointestinal evaluation revealed dark stool that was guaiac positive.
Pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Sensation was intact to light touch bilaterally at the distal lower and upper extremities as well as the three divisions of cranial nerve V.  Rapid alternating movements were intact bilaterally.
Reflexes were 0 at the lower extremities bilaterally and 2+ symmetrically at the upper extremities.
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Note that the patient was guaiac positive, but nasogastric lavage negative (as noted above.)
The CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 10,300, hematocrit of 30.0 (which upon repeat was 31) and platelet count of 289,000.
Chem 7 revealed a sodium of 138, potassium of 6.0 (which upon repeat was 4.0), chloride of 108, bicarbonate of 19, BUN of 49, creatinine of 1.3 and glucose of 121.
Coagulation studies revealed a prothrombin time of 12.4, partial thromboplastin time of 25.6 and INR of 1.0.
Liver function tests and pancreatic function tests revealed an ALT of 33, AST of 52, total bilirubin of 0.2, amylase of 41 and lipase of 21.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled times three:  CK #1 was 287 with an MB of 6, CK #2 was 177 with an MB of 4 and a troponin of less than 3 and CK #3 was likewise negative.
RADIOLOGY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with no increase in pulmonary vasculature and no infiltrates or effusions.
On [**2155-8-17**], the patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed grade 1 esophagitis at the gastroesophageal junction as well as a large, cratered, 3 cm ulcer with adherent clot in the proximal bulb of the duodenum.
Helicobacter pylori was sent, which eventually came back as positive.
Thereafter, her hematocrit remained stable.
Thus, she will need a follow up colonoscopy as an outpatient to evaluate for possible malignancy.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Following embolization, the patient's diet was advanced successfully and she tolerated it without nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
Her electrolytes remained stable.
