Csurg was consulted and pre-op workup with panorex, UA/UCx, etc was completed.
# CAD: s/p CABG in [**2167**], has stable coronary artery and graft disease on cath in [**10-30**] (prox Cx 100% stenosis, prox RCA 100% stenosis, all grafts widely patent.
# Acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction due to aortic stenosis: Last EF 55-60% ([**2182**]).
Pt presented with fluid overload on exam and by CXR.
However, as above, pt had flash pulmonary edema, and required transfer to CCU overnight for brief use of CPAP, and diuresis with lasix and diuril.
# Tachy-brady s/p PPM [**4-28**]: EP evaluation and interrogation of ICD/PPM to determnine whether it needs to be suppressed during the valve procedure, which will involve rapid right ventricular pacing (up to 200 bpm) during balloon valvuloplasty and 110 BPM during valve placement.
His Cr was monitored, and was 2.1 prior to core valve replacement.
The patient remained on the Core Valve pathway and had an echo and neuro evaluation prior to discharge.
