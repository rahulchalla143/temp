PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH  FINDINGS:  Since most recent film, there is probably slight increase in size to right- sided small effusion with stable appearance to left-sided small effusion.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2126-3-18**] atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response has appeared.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
On POD 6 it was decided she was stable and ready for discharge to home with visiting nurses.
