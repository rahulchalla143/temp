Repeat NCHCT on [**8-29**] was unremarkable, and repeat LP was performed on [**8-30**], but again, I have no records of the result.
Renal US showed no hydronephrosis, and acyclovir was DC'd on [**8-30**].
Unfortunately patient remained obtunded and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Skin: 2-3mm scab over right hip with a few surrounding erythematous macules distriubuted in a linear fashion  Exam on transfer [**2136-9-7**]: VS: afebrile, BP 110s/70s HR in 80-100s, RR 20-30s O2 96% on nonrebreather CV: tachycardic, normal S1/S2 and 2/6 systolic murmur PULM: tachypneic, poor air movements throughout, decreased breath sounds in LLL and bibasilar crackles NEURO: obtunded, opens eyes only to loud voice and noxious stimuli (such as sternal rub and nailbed pressure on extremities).

MRI [**2136-9-2**]: 1.
Fluid-opacification of the mastoid air cells, bilaterally, as on the OSH CT dated [**2136-8-29**]; this should be correlated clinically.
CTA chest [**2136-9-4**]: 1.
When clinically feasible, upper GI study may be helpful.
MRI head [**2136-9-11**]: 1.
Slightly larger ventricular size when compared to the prior examination of [**2133-2-7**].
Her repeat LP here showed increased WBC in CSF, so she was started on IV bactrim given concern for listeria meningitis by the ID team.
Review of reports from OSH showed imaging without signficant acute new process and labs relatively unremarkable.
Patient was continued on acyclovir for treatment of VZV meningoencephalitis and EEG was obtained to evaluate for seizures, which showed slowing and PLEDs but no actual seizure activity.
Her initial MRI/MRA of head did not show any evidence of CVA or enhancing area and no evidence of vasculitis on MRI/MRA.
Her repeat MRI on [**2136-9-11**] showed new subarachnoid hemorrhage, and her anticoagulation for DVT/PE were reversed, but upon discussion with her family, decision was made to focus on comfort care given the poor prognosis.
Her CSF showed 1.8 million copies of VZV on the initial LP, and subsequent LPs showed decreasing copies of VZV (~2900 copies on LP from [**2136-8-30**], and <500 copies on [**2136-9-3**]).
Currently 1.1 per OSH reports, but was up to 1.5 and attributed to acyclovir tx.
Her creatinine remained stable around 0.7-0.8.
Information was obtained from  OSH.
OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 2.
Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 3.
Timolol Maleate 0.25% 1 DROP BOTH EYES Frequency is Unknown 13.
Calcium 500 + D *NF* (calcium carbonate-vitamin D3) unknown Oral unknown 19.
Repeat lumbar puncture was done and showed that she still had a lot of white blood cells, suspicious for infection.
