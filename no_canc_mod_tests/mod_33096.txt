RUQ U/S performed on [**10-10**] showed innumerable gallstones, mild GB wall thickening and small amt of pericholecystic fluid with prominent CBD at 7mm.
His labs were significant at that time for leukocytosis to 16.3 (N 87%, 11 bands), INR 3.8, lipase 9,856, TBili 1.6 (direct 0.4), and mild transaminitis.
His WBC trended down to 7.4, AST/ALT returned to [**Location 213**], lipase trended down to 500s, and TBili increased to 3.8 (DBili 1.0).
His INR was reversed with Vit K and FFP and he was brought to the OR on [**10-14**] and gallbladder removed.
ERCP was attempted post-operatively, and had a dilated pancreatic duct w/ apparent small stone, but team was unable to selectively cannulate CBD so plan was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for repeat ERCP.
Also of note, the patient had difficult to control atrial fibrillation and cardiology c/s was obtained [**10-14**], recommending increased dose of Toprol to 100mg daily as well as digoxin 0.25mg  daily.
