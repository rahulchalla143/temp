In the Emergency Department, his blood pressure was found to be 89/54 initially responsive to intravenous fluids.
However, despite giving three liters of intravenous fluids his blood pressure remained 85 to 115/50 to 60.
He was given 500 mg intravenously of Levaquin times one for a question of urosepsis, given that the urinalysis showed positive leukocyte esterase.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97, heart rate was 107 and irregular, blood pressure was 89/54, respiratory rate was 21, and oxygen saturation was 99% on 3 liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Cardiovascular examination revealed heart sounds poorly heard.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremity examination revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times four.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 13.8 (with 81% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, and 5% monocytes), hematocrit was 37.4, platelets were 236, and mean cell volume was 90.
Sodium was 135, potassium was 4.8, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen was 30, creatinine was 3, and blood glucose was 100.
Anion gap was 15.
Urinalysis revealed large leukocyte esterase.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed pacemaker in place.
Electrocardiogram revealed irregularly irregular, rate of 122, normal QRS, normal axis.
Eventually, after receiving more than four to five liters of fluid, the patient's blood pressure rebounded, and he was not nearly as tachycardic.
An echocardiogram from [**2185-11-22**] showed an ejection fraction of 45%, mild global left ventricular dysfunction, and a moderate-to-large circumferential pericardial effusion with a circumference of 2.5 cm.
The echocardiogram also showed 1+ aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
The right atrial pressure was 22.
The right ventricular pressure was 41/22.
The pulmonary artery pressure was 45/30, and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 30.
The relative equalization of diastolic pressures was worrisome for tamponade physiology.
Analysis showed greater than one million red blood cells and [**Pager number **] white blood cells.
There were no organisms visualized, and the culture was negative.
The patient's initial pericardial pressure was measured at 15.
Eventually, the patient's pericardial pressure came down further, and his chamber pressures normalized.
The patient had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 70, and a borderline rheumatoid factor.
Of note, the patient's INR was also noted to be as high as 5.9.
Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2185-11-24**] revealed only a small pericardial effusion.
In comparison to the transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2185-11-22**]; most of the pericardial fluid has been removed.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient initially had an evaluated white blood cell count, but was afebrile.
Urinalysis was significant for large leukocyte esterase.
However, the patient had only 3 to 5 white blood cells in a clean catch sample.
In addition, his stool cultures and ova and parasite studies came back negative.
The patient's blood cultures remained negative from admission.
GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  Because the patient was in house, there was a decision made to work up the colonic thickening seen on a recent abdominal computed tomography.
The patient had a cortisol level on [**2186-11-22**] at a level of 14.
A cosyntropin stimulation test was performed.
The patient's pre-cosyntropin level was 2.8, and his post cosyntropin level was 11.
His creatinine on admission was 3.
With intravenous fluids, the creatinine came down to the patient's baseline of 1.5 to 1.7.
The patient had good urine output after receiving fluids.
