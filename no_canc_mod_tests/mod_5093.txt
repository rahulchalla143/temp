By report he was administered SL NTG and nitro paste with improvement in BP and chest discomfort.
He subsequently underwen ETT with pMIBI which demonstrated a perfusion deficit at rest and was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and renal artery angiogram.
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiac catheterization today and was found to have 3VD, and a CABG is now planned.

Recent testing: [**2131-4-24**]: Echo showed a normal LV size and function.
EF of 60-65%.
Pulmonary systolic pressure was estimated to be 30-35%.
[**2131-4-20**]: Nuclear stress test where the patient exercised for 6 minutes 57 seconds on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol stopping due to shortness of breath and leg pain.
The nuclear images demonstrated a normal sized left ventricle.
[**2131-4-30**] Cardiac Catheterization COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly to moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP was 18 mm Hg).
Systemic arterial pressure was normal (aortic pressure was 121/73 mm Hg).
Left ventriculography revealed a contrast calculated ejection fraction of 65%.
Bilateral selective renal angiography demonstrated widely patent renal arteries.

Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w normal LV diastolic function.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Conclusions: PRE-CPB: 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function.
LVEF now 55%.
