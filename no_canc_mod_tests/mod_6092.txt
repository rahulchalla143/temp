A routine CT scan of his abdomen showed intra-abdominal free air but this was thought to be due to his recent PD catheter manipulation.
Two hours after his initial examination his pressor requirement increased.
Due to the fact that we were not able to get an accurate abdominal examination, as he was intubated, we elected to take him to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy.
This was not believed to be due to infection as he was afebrile with a normal WBC count and negative culture data.
A head CT was obtained and this was normal.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and his CK-MB index peaked at 11.9%.
A CXR obtained at that time showed pulmonary edema.
Final pathology was consistent with ischemia.
He passed a speech and swallow evaluation post-extubation and was started on a regular diet.
His WBC did trend down but took a sharp upward trend and peaked at 36K.
A CT scan of his abdomen showed no intra-abdominal pathology to explain the rise in WBC.
His hematocrit remained stable at 26 and his last transfusion was on [**2193-3-19**].
All blood, urine, C.diff, and sputum cultures remained negative on multiple occasions.
At this point a CT scan was obtained and it revealed no intra-abdominal pathology.
