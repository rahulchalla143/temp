The patient had recurrence of exertional angina in [**2107-12-13**] and went for a catheterization on [**2108-1-11**].
His symptoms improved slightly, but following catheterization the patient states he has experienced a progressive decrease in his exercise tolerance with frequent dyspnea and angina on exertion that resolves with rest.
q.d., vitamin C, and vitamin E.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  An ex-smoker.
The hemodynamic findings were a cardia output Fick of 16.4, a cardiac index of 8.32, a capillary wedge pressure of 13, a pulmonary artery pressure of 29/14, right atrial pressure of 14.
An emergent echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular systolic function with no evidence of a pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary artery saturation increased to 90% on dopamine, but there was no evidence for stepup during saturation run.
A repeat angiogram demonstrated no further dye extravasation and persistent occlusion of intermedius stent.
On presentation to the Coronary Care Unit, the patient's blood pressure was 169/75, pulse was 61, respiratory rate was 14, pulse oximetry was 98% on 2 liters.
A pulmonary artery pressure was 22/11.
The patient was alert and oriented times three, and neurologic examination was grossly intact.
His echocardiogram at the time of catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 75% to 80%, left ventricular cavity under filled, left ventricular systolic function was hyperdynamic, no wall abnormalities, no aortic regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation, and no pericardial effusions.
A repeat echocardiogram in the morning showed no signs of a pericardial effusion.
Cycling of the creatine phosphokinases revealed a peak of 71 with no troponins.
PULMONARY:  His oxygen saturations were good.
HEMATOLOGY:  His hematocrit fell from 39.9 on [**6-20**] to 32.3 after catheterization on [**6-25**].
Repeat hematocrits remained stable, and the patient had no signs of bleeding.
