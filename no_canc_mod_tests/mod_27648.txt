Apgars were 6 at one minute, 8 at five minutes and 9 at ten minutes.
Growth parameters at birth: weight 1330 grams, HC 28 cm, length 38.5 cm.
FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE: Her birthweight was 1330 grams, head circumference was 28 cm, and length was 38.5 cm, all less than 10th percentile for growth parameters.
Discharge weight was 1835 grams, head circumference 29.5 cm, and length 43 cm.
GI: Infant was noted to develop hyperbilirubinemia, treated with 6 days of phototherapy over first week of life with peak bilirubin during that time of 6.3/0.3.
Phototherapy was finally discontinued on day of life 21, [**2149-8-15**] with a bilirubin level of 7.2/0.3; rebound bilirubin on [**8-16**], day of discharge, was 6.6/0.2 Repeat bilirubin level is recomended in two days, on [**2149-8-18**].
HEMATOLOGY: Hematocrit on admission was 50.8.
Due to persistent hyperbilirubinemia as described above, evaluation for hemolysis was undertaken.
Repeat Hct on day of life 18, [**2149-8-12**], had declined to 34, and gradual further decline was noted with Hct of 32 on [**8-14**] and 27.3 on [**8-16**].
Reticulocyte count was 4% on [**8-12**], increasing to 6.9% on [**8-16**].
Hematology was consulted, and peripheral smear was thought to be suggestive of hemolysis.
Blood type was O positive, direct Coombs negative.
Further evaluation will be done as an outpatient.
Repeat hematocrit and reticulocyte count are recommended with repeat bilirubin level two days after discharge, on [**2149-8-18**].
Parents are to have blood samples drawn at [**Hospital1 18**] laboratory for CBC and RBC smear for review by hematology, and infant and family should follow-up with hematology at [**Hospital1 **] in two weeks (hematology fellow: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11818**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 75048**], hematology clinic [**Telephone/Fax (1) 47801**], CH page operator [**Telephone/Fax (1) 53567**]).
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: CBC and blood culture were obtained at admission.
CBC was benign, and blood cultures remain negative at 48 hours.
NEURO: Head ultrasound on day of life #7 was within normal limits without evidence of ventriculomegaly.
SENSORY: Hearing screen was performed with automated auditory brainstem responses, and the infant passed both ears.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight 1835 grams.
Breath sounds clear and equal in room air with slight retractions and comfortable respirations.
CAR SEAT POSITION SCREENING: Not performed; as the infant birth size was so small, parents opted to do a car bed.
STATE NEWBORN SCREEN: Initial screen on [**7-28**] was within normal limits although amino acid profile was abnormal; repeat screen on [**8-7**] was normal.
Parents to have CBC and smears performed at [**Hospital1 18**] prior to visit with hematology.
