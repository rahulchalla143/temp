Microbiology: [**2174-5-3**] 11:59 pm URINE      Source: Catheter.
URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
The patient's liver synthetic dysfunction also was impacted with her INR increasing to a peak of 4.2.
Her INR was 1.7 on [**2174-5-5**] (Day 7 of hospitalization) and her NAC was discontinued.
The patient was placed on IV fluids and by the time of discharge, her creatinine had improved to baseline at 0.7.
Her CK peaked at 9667 but was in the 100s at discharge.
5) Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped from 45 to 24.6 in the setting of large volume IV fluids.
A repeat hematocrit was performed on the same day of the bowel movement which contained blood, and showed a stable hematocrit at the time of discharge.
Iron studies did not show an iron deficiency anemia, and a reticulocyte index was low; it was thought that the damage sustained to the kidneys may have temporarily decreased the amount of Erythropoietin produced, but that with further kidney recovery, the hematocrit would also improve.
