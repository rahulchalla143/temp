On attempting to transition him from transort meds to our meds his BP would drop from the low 100's to 60's.
Initially ABG should acidosis of 7.18 and Bicarb of 15.
His pressors returned to low 100's after fluid boluses but then would have transient episodes of hypotension.
EF at OSH was 5-10%.
Pt was given bicarb and calcium and increased his minute ventilation to blow off CO2.
His BP dropped into the 50's despite maximizing three pressors.
He was given epineprine 1mg times 2 and atropine 1mg times 2 with no response.
