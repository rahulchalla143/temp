She had a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 69**] prior to this visit in [**Month (only) 359**] with congestive heart failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and acute-on-chronic renal failure.
One admission on [**12-14**] showed an INR of 10.65.
A colonoscopy was also done at that time.
INR on admission to the outside hospital was 5.62.
Her INR was reversed.
She is now transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation and treatment as well as workup for possible aortic valve replacement/mitral valve replacement with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
The patient had no catheterization of record on here; but appears to have had her last catheterization in [**2117-3-29**] at an outside hospital with clean coronaries.
On [**2118-1-18**] a transesophageal echocardiogram had been done at [**Hospital1 69**] which showed an ejection fraction of 30 to 35 percent, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, trace aortic insufficiency, 3 plus mitral regurgitation, 2 plus tricuspid regurgitation, and no noted AF at the time.
Preoperative carotid ultrasounds also showed a probable occluded left vertebral artery, but less than 40 percent bilaterally in her common carotid artery.
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] determined the patient needed a new cardiac catheterization as the prior one was almost 10 months old.
A GI consultation was discussed, although there was bleeding in the setting of an elevated INR.
She had a CT scan at an outside hospital in [**Month (only) **], for which the Cardiothoracic Surgery team was trying to obtain the films for neurologic review.
Colonoscopy from the outside hospital from [**12-17**] showed diffuse moderate-to- severe diverticulosis of the sigmoid and descending colon and a colon polyp.
A small-bowel series on [**2117-12-20**] also at an outside hospital showed a distended third portion of the duodenum with recommendations for abdominal CT.
A preoperative chest x-ray was unremarkable.
Her pulmonary function tests showed a FEV1 of 0.76 (which is 47 percent of predicted).
Preoperative laboratories were as follows.
Sodium was 141, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 29, blood urea nitrogen was 35, creatinine was 2.6, with a blood sugar of 85.
White blood cell count was 4.6, the hematocrit was 34, and the platelet count was 195,000.
A Dental consultation was not done.
She was also seen by Physical Therapy for initial evaluation and Case Management for future discharge planning.
Also on [**2-18**], a chest x-ray showed small bilateral effusions, but the patient made excellent progress on the floor after her pacemaker and was discharged from the hospital.
A repeat cardiac catheterization showed a normal left main, normal LAD, a normal ramus, a 30 percent OM1 lesion of the circumflex, and a normal RCA, as well as severe aortic stenosis.
On the day of discharge, the patient's examination was as follows.
The blood pressure was 124/56, a paced right-handed at 70, the temperature was 97, and the respiratory rate was 20.
Her weight was 70.8 kilograms on this - her 15th postoperative day.
White count was 6.4, the hematocrit was 27.2, and the platelet count was 420,000.
Sodium was 141, potassium was 4.4, chloride was 107, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was 27, creatinine was 1.9 (which was below the patient's baseline), and blood sugar was 101.
Her chest incision had no drainage or erythema.
