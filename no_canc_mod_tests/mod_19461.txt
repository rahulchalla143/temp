GENETICS:  [**Hospital3 1810**] Genetics has been involved and chromosomes were sent on  [**2157-4-11**] which revealed a normal karyotype, normal 46XX karyotype and FISH [**Last Name (un) 53066**]-Dieker syndrome for microdeletion 17p13.3 was negative also at that time.
SENSORY:  A hearing screening was performed with automated auditory brain stem responses.
OPHTHALMOLOGY:  Genetics recommended ophthalmology to perform an eye examination on [**2157-4-15**] which was normal.
