Patient believes the shortness of breath is related to his increased abdominal girth from weight gain of 22lbs over the past year.
EKG was obtained and was concerning for new twi in anterior leads; troponin < 0.01 with normal CKMB.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 6 cm.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
In [**2141**] the patient had a Cypher DES placed in his proximal RCA (3.5 x 18mm) and a Cypher DES placed in his mid LAD (3.0 x 28mm).
Now coming in with unstable angina and subsequently referred for cardiac catheterization.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections using a 5 French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast injections.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.

Upon exchanged for a 6 French sheath, the patient developed a vagal episode with decrease in SBP to 75 mmHg and HR to 49 bpm, requiring 2 mg of IV Atropine, IV fluid, and Dopamine in escalating doses up to 20 mcg/kg/min with good response.
Interim angiography showed a lesion at the proximal edge of the stent which we also directly stented with another overlapping 3.0x8 mm Cypher DES.
Final angiography showed 0% residual stenosis with TIMI 3 flow and no dissection or distal emboli.

2- Central aortic pressure was 105/67 mmHg 3- Sucecssful direct stenting of a distal RCA lesion (fiolling defect with plaque rupture) with two overlapping 3.0x8 mm Cypher stents.
Patient had a recent stress MIBI ([**2145-7-23**]) that did not showed stable wall motion abnormalities with one small area of reversible ischemia that was also stable from prior.
MI was ruled out with negative enzymes x3.
EKG was unchanged from prior.
His groin site was monitored and he had no evidence of hematoma, AV fistual and DP pulses were 2+.
# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Patient with history of CHF following MI in [**2141**].
Cardiac catheterization showed a filling defect and disrupted vessel wall integrity suggestive of unstable plaque rupture in your right coronary artery.
Two overlapping stents were placed along this area to prevent further generation of clot and future occlusion of this vessel.
