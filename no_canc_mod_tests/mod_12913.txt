An EKG was done and the patient was found to be bradycardiac with 5 mm ST segment elevations in V3 through V6, II, III, and aVF.
Her chest pressure resolved on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]; however, the patient continued to complain of dyspnea and diaphoresis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.9, blood pressure 116/58, heart rate 73, respiratory rate 20, 02 saturation 95% on room air.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
LABORATORY DATA FROM THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  CK 43, troponin less than 0.01.
Hematocrit 41.
The initial EKG at the outside hospital showed 5 mm ST segment elevations in V3 through V6, 2 mm ST segment elevation in II, III, and aVF.
Prior to lysis, EKG disclosed 2 mm ST segment elevation in V3 through V6, 1 mm ST segment elevation in II, III, and aVF.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and transferred to the CCU for further management.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  A.  CAD:  The patient was taken to the Cath Lab for cardiac catheterization.
Coronary angiography of the right dominant circulation revealed no significant residual coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated left ventricular filling pressure with an LVEDP of 22 mmHg in the setting of normal systemic arterial blood pressure.
There was evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 43/13/26 mmHg.
The cardiac output was preserved at 5.1 liters per minute.
Left ventriculography demonstrated anterolateral, apical, and inferior apical akinesis with a calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 53% but a visually observed left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%, severe 3+ mitral regurgitation was seen.
Her cardiac enzymes were cycled and CKs peaked around 300.
Lipid profile split disclosed an HDL of 66, LDL of 113.
ACE inhibitor was initiated when the patient's blood pressure could tolerate this.
PUMP:  The patient underwent an echocardiogram on [**2179-5-17**].
Echocardiogram disclosed resting regional wall motion abnormalities including akinesis of the lower half of the LV with a dyskinetic apex.
The patient's goal INR is [**3-15**].
HEMATOLOGIC:  On [**2179-5-17**], it was noted that the patient's hematocrit dropped to 27.3.
A CT scan of the abdomen did not disclose evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
A right groin ultrasound did not show evidence of hematoma.
An Orthopedics consult was obtained for evaluation of the patient's fracture.
The patient is to undergo a right femoral groin ultrasound on [**2179-7-9**] at 10:30 a.m.  Ultrasound is required to confirm that right femoral AV fistula has resolved.
