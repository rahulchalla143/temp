Her blood pressures came up to SBP of 80 with 3 L NS (baseline SBP as outpatient is 120s-140s).
Labs significant for Na of 130, K of 6.3 (hemolyzed 4.9 on repeat), Cre of 1.9 (baseline 1.5-1.9), WBC of 3.7 with 3% bands, CK 206 and Troponin-T 0.01, Lactate 1.7.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
These findings are new from the study done in [**2108**].
Repeat CT is recommended in [**2-8**] months.
In this patient with history of previous malignancy, followup with a dedicated CT of the chest is recommended in six months.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient's blood pressure was 138/76 with a baseline tachycardia which is present as an outpatient.
DDx included hypoglycemia, medication effect (recent history of hypotension as an outpatient with decrease in blood pressure medications).
Patient also with history of syncope in the past with negative outpatient work-up in the past including TTE, autonomic testing, stress test, and EEG.
DDx also includes possible vagal episode from pain, infection was also on the differential so she was initially broadly covered with vancomycin and zosyn, especially in the setting of fat stranding and mesesnteric LAD seen on CT A/P.
Her blood pressure improved with IV fluids, never requiring pressors.
She remained on antibiotics until her cultures were negative for 48 hours, and then remained afebrile off antibiotics.
Her anti-hypertensives were held and her tricyclic (desipramine) was weaned, given that it can cause orthostatic hypotension.
After her first night in the ICU her blood pressures remained stable and she was stable to be called out to the medical floor.
Leukopenia: Pt with WBC of 3.7 (baseline [**4-9**]), was considered to be possibly in the setting of infection.
However, the patient's blood cultures, urine cultures, and chest x-ray did not show evidence of infection.
Her WBC count remained stable throughout the hospitalization and was 3.8 at discharge.
A Right Lower Lobe pulmonary nodule should get follow-up with a chest CT in 6 months.

You were found to have a very low blood pressure in the emergency room and were given fluids to increase your blood pressure.
Your lab tests did not show any signs of an infection that may have caused the low blood pressure.
We did x-rays and a CT, which did not show infections.
We did an ECHO of your heart, which was within normal limits.
Your low blood pressure and loss of consciousness may be due to some of the medications you take that can cause low blood pressure.
You should have your blood pressure checked at this appointment and discuss whether or not to restart your lisinopril.
