On arrival at [**Hospital1 **], her O2 sat was 97% on 2L.
She also had a CXR on [**12-28**] which showed a left lower lobe pneumonia for which she is on ceftriaxone, flagyl, and vancomycin.
On exam in the ED, she was noted to have decreased air movement with rhonchi and faint wheezes which improved with nebulizer treatments.
Her CXR was not impressive.
An EKG showed multifocal atrial tachycardia and mild lateral ST depressions.
She then again got worse in the ED, and an ABG was 7.25/94/66.

Although it could represent subsegmental atelectasis, cannot rule out the presence of pneumonia.
Head CT [**2176-1-5**]: There is no evidence for hemorrhage.
CXR [**2176-1-5**]: Very large left-sided pneumothorax with signs of tension.
Chest CT [**2176-1-5**]: FINDINGS: The large left hydropneumothorax, mostly air filled was also shown on plain chest radiographs earlier today.
CXR [**2176-1-5**] pm: Compared with the examination obtained approximately 6 1/2 hours earlier, a left chest tube has been inserted, with its tip ending in the apex.
CXR [**2176-1-8**]: Left lung appears to be completely re-expanded.
CXR [**2176-2-5**]: One of the two left basal pleural tubes have been withdrawn approximately 6 cm now projecting over the cardiac apex and left hemidiaphragm.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2176-2-18**]):       [**10-23**] PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2176-2-20**]):       OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # 203-0763R          [**2176-2-11**].
SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # 203-1121R [**2176-2-12**].
Sputum cultures only grew yeast, which was thought to be contamination.
Most recent sputum cultures grew E coli, thought to be a contaminant as well, as the patient has been afebrile, with resolving leukocytosis, unremarkable chest x-ray, and no other symptoms of a pneumonia.
Her sputum culture grew gram positive cocci and she was started on a course vancomycin, to complete a 10 day course of vancomycin and 10 day course of meropenem.
Her vancomycin had been supratherapeutic and was being monitored daily for dosing purposes.
Pneumothorax - On the morning of [**2176-1-5**], the patient's chest x-ray showed a vertical linear opacity consistent with pneumothorax.
A chest CT at the time confirmed a large pneumothorax involving most of her left lung.
This was thought to occur secondary to positive pressure with preexisting severe bullous disease, and likely occurred the night prior to the chest x-ray, as she began to have low blood pressure responding to IV fluids that night.
The basilar chest tube manifested an inspiratory leak which resolved until the patient's tracheostomy, at which time the leak recurred.
A chest x-ray after chest tube removal showed no pneumothorax.
However, that night she became increasingly tachypneic, and a CXR in the morning showed recurrence of the pneumothorax.
Her chest tubes were put to water-seal on [**2176-1-31**], then were clamped on [**2-9**], and daily CXRs have revealed no evidence of recurrent PTX.
The chest tubes were sequentially clamped and then removed with serial chest xrays revealing no pneumothorax.
Fluid status - On admission, the patient was volume overloaded.
Yeast infection - She had urine cultures sent that showed only yeast, and vaginal discharge consistent with yeast.
Her metoprolol and diltiazem dosages were increased, with some effect, but she continued to have these episodes with maximal doses.
She was placed on an esmolol drip, which helped Ms. [**Known lastname 7474**] to revert to NSR at a dose of 100mcg/min, but experienced recurrent episodes on the drip.
Urinary tract infection - Urine culture grew E. coli and Enterobacter clocae on [**1-24**].
Vascular surgery was consulted to assess her gangrenous toe, but the decision was made to defer any interventions until such time as her respiratory status had significantly improved.
Hyperthyroidism - She was continued on methimazole.
