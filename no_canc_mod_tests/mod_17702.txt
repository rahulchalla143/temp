EKG changes, specifically ST elevations in the inferior leads resolved following his stent.
Of note, he was found to have a fasting LDL of 115 and HDL of 50.
His MI and consequent muscle breakdown is the most likely etiology of his mild rise of LFTs.
An echocardiogram on [**1-5**], following his cath was significant for mild LVH with mild regional systolic dysfunction in the basal inferior and basal inferior septal segments.
Hypertension:  His antihypertensive regimen on discharge included the following: atenolol 200 daily, lisinopril 5, and HCTZ 25. .
