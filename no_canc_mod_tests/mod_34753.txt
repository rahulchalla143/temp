MRI brain [**2116-7-28**]: 1.
No significant change in the size of the acute hematoma in the right occipital lobe compared to the CT scan done a few hours earlier.
A follow study after resolution of the hematoma including the area of interest or a conventional diagnostic angiogram can be performed for better assessment of any vascular lesions.
If a followup MR angiogram is considered, please mention on the indication to include the area of abnormality completely on the MR angiogram.
CTA [**2116-7-28**]: No change in appearance of right occipital parenchymal hemorrhage with a small amount of surrounding vasogenic edema.
Followup MRI after resolution of the hematoma is recommended to evaluate its underlying cause.
CT Head [**2116-8-5**]: There is a slight increase in the right occipital parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding area of vasogenic edema.
Brain imaging revealed a right occipital bleed.
However, subsequent conventional angiography revealed the presence of an AVM.
The pt underwent formal visual field testing [**2116-8-3**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] where she was found to have a left homonymous hemianopsia.
Her neuro exam was also closely observed and remained stable to the time of discharge.
Neuro exam prior to discharge: She is alert and awake, orientated x 3.
