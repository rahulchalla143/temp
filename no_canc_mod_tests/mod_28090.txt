COMPARISON: Comparison is made to the previous study from [**4-27**].
TECHNIQUE: A CT of chest was performed with axial images taken from the lung bases to the lung apices with non-contrast dynamic imaging and reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes.
CT CHEST FINDINGS: On the lung windows, there are bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left side with some associated atelectasis.
On the mediastinal windows, at the level of the arch of the aorta, an outpouching is noted, which extends laterally.
CT OF ABDOMEN FINDINGS: Some calcified granulomas are noted in the liver.
Two brightly enhancing lesions in segment IV and caudate lobes, which are unchanged.
