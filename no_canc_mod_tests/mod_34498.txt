TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were acquired with and without the administration of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
COMAPARISON: Multiple prior CTs including the most recent head CT dated [**2115-11-28**].
FINDINGS: The study is somewhat limited due to patient motion especially on FLAIR imaging and pre-contrast T1.
MR angiography shows lack of flow in right PCA, and right superior cerebellar artery is not clearly noted.
Hypoplasia of right A1 segment suggestive of restricted or limited flow.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Compared to the findings of the prior study, left ventricular systolic function has improved.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %) with mild global hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta and aortic arch show no evidence of thrombus or dissection.
Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2115-11-26**] (images reviewed), left ventricular systolic function has improved.
He underwent preoperative workup and was taken to the operating room on [**11-26**] where he underwent an AVR (mechanical) and ascending aorta and hemiarch.
He was found to be agitated, with left sided weakness the night after surgery, CT head revealed a right PCA stroke.
Repeat CT scan was unchanged.
