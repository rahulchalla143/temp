Initial vital signs were 100/80 with a heart rate of 100.
Initial hematocrit at that hospital was 24.4 with a platelet count of 18.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] where she received a six pack of platelets and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells for an initial platelet count of 13 and a hematocrit of 19.
Negative for falls, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, sensation of cold, sinus headaches, chest pressure, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dark stools, bloody stools, dysuria, easy bruising or bleeding aside from epistaxis.
Of note, the patient does note that her urine has been dark for approximately one week and she does note some bleeding when flossing her teeth.
Last CD4 count 41 with a viral load of greater than 100,000 on [**2183-3-5**].
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 128/86.
Heart rate 89 and regular.
Respiratory rate 16.
Oxygen saturation 99% on room air.
Temperature 96.5.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Pupils equal, round and reactive to light bilaterally.
Lungs: Few crackles at the bases, otherwise, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 7.8, hematocrit 19.7, platelet count 13, baseline platelets ranging from 30 to 60s.
Baseline white blood cell count 2.0.
Baseline hematocrit grater than 30.
Differential:  88% neutrophils, 0% bands, 9% lymphocytes, INR 1.0.
Baseline creatinine .7 on [**2182-12-16**], 1.2 on [**2183-1-6**], 2.7 on [**2183-3-5**].
AST 69, ALT 15, LDH 207, alkaline phosphatase 116, total bilirubin 0.2, amylase 74.
Urinalysis with large blood, 500 protein, 500 red blood cells, TSH 4.3, albumin 2.0.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit given perfuse epistaxis in the setting of thrombocytopenia with drop in hematocrit to 19.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**2183-3-17**] demonstrating hypolobulated megakaryocytes with an adequate number of megakaryocytes suggesting that steroids might be beneficial as the diagnosis of ITP was considered.
It should also be noted that DIC/HUS was also considered, but felt to be less likely given the lack of schistocytes on the peripheral smear or LDH haptoglobin and INR consistent with a DIC picture.
Throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, she was mildly oliguric with a urine output of approximately 20-30 cc per hour.
A renal biopsy was performed on [**2183-3-14**] to better elucidate the cause of the renal failure.
However, it seems that hepatitis C would be an unlikely culprit given that her viral load was undetectable and this had been a chronic issue, but the renal failure was a subacute issue.
At the time of discharge, the patient's creatinine was 2.7.
It should be noted that the creatinine was not increased by Lasix nor did it increase over the course of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.
Anemia:  The patient was transfused to a hematocrit goal of greater than 27.
Other causes of infection were also considered such as Clostridium difficile, which was negative times three.
Chest x-ray's were unrevealing, as was urine culture.
She was initially maintained on a Dilaudid PCA with no basal rate and prn rate of .05.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  She was maintained on Renagel and Tums for hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia.
Hepatitis C. 3.
