CT showed Bilateral acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, greater on the left, and an acute/subacute small left subdural hemorrhage with resultant mild swelling of the left cerebral hemisphere and a 6-mm rightward midline shift without signs of herniation, Chronic lacunes in the left external capsule and the head of the caudate nucleus, and Frontal subcutaneous hematoma with a possible underlying non-displaced skull fracture.
A MRI was requested by the neurosurgery team however the patient has signficant difficulty in enclosed spaces.
Ativan was used to calm the patient and she was sent down but a scan was unable to be obtained due to motion artifact.
Repeat CT showed  Marked interval increase in diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with interval development of notable larger amount of hemorrhage on the left side, particularly in the sylvian fissure.
An angiogram was obtained in the morning of [**2153-11-8**] which showed a MCA aneurysm.
The neurosurgery team decided to transfer the patient to the [**Hospital1 756**] for further care.
