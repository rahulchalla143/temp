Microbiology: blood cultures ([**9-1**]): negative .
EKG: [**9-1**]:  Probable atrial flutter with 2:1 A-V conduction with an atrial rate of about 320 and a ventricular rate of about 160.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-8-15**] rapid atrial flutter is present.
Imaging: CXR ([**9-1**]):  IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases which may reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.
Arterial study of lower extremity ([**9-4**]): Normal triphasic Doppler waveforms were acquired in the common femoral arteries bilaterally.
The Doppler waveform at the right popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis is monophasic.
The pulse volume recordings are symmetrical.
Lower extremity ultrasound ([**9-10**]):   IMPRESSION: No DVT in the right lower extremity.
His rate slowed to the 80s-90s and he was taken off of the dilt gtt and started on Diltiazem 90mg Q6H.
His TSH remained <0.02, and Endocrine was reconsulted (see below).
His heart rates were in the 90s at the time of discharge.
Patient's T4 was initially elevated at 15.9, but decreased over 6 days to 9.7.
His troponin is elevated chronically in the setting of renal failure.
