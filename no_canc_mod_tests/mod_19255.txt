He underwent cardiac cath on [**8-4**] which showed a right dominant system, left main and 3 vessel disease.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient was chest pain free, EKG showed ST depressions II, V4-V5, TWI II, III, avF, V4-V5.
Initial vitals were 97.6/ bp 105/92/ 72/ 24/ 98% on 3L.
Cardiac enzymes here CK 386, MB 29, index 12.7, troponin 2.2.
Pt demonstrated signs of altered mental status, and the heparin was stopped until an emergent head CT could be obtained.
Cardiac cath revealed 3-VD, LMCA with 80% distal, diffuse 50-60% stenosis, apical 70% stenosis.
LAD showed ostial 80%, LCX diffuse 60-70% stenosis with total occlusion of distal OM1.
Further review of symptoms negative for prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, positive for chronic dyspnea, no orthopnea, no palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Skin: Stage II decubitus ulcer on buttock Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; PT and DP dopplerable Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; DP and PT dopplerable  Pertinent Results: Admission EKG demonstrated: SR, LAD, poor R wave progression, nml intervals, ST depressions II, V4,V5 .
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-7-29**], global left ventricular systolic function is more depressed (but was overestimated on the prior study).
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2179-8-4**] demonstrated: 1.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated left main and 3 vessel disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal left ventricular systolic pressure of 104 mm Hg and normal LVEDP of 12 mm Hg.
Sytemic arterial systolic and diastolic pressures were normal.
Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation, mild global hypokinesis, and LVEF of 45%.
CARDIAC CATH on [**2179-9-19**]: 1.
CXR [**9-19**]: A tracheostomy is noted in unchanged position.

Vessels- known 3-VD from previous cardiac cath, had been medically managed, now with recurrent chest pain and NSTEMI.
S/P cardiac cath with BMS of LMCA/LAD and PTCA of OM1.
A beta blocker, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] was also started.
CHF- has a history of HF with EF >55% in [**July 2179**], a new Echo showed moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
Rhythm- patient with multiple episodes of MAT during hospitalization, and one episode of atrial tachycardia with HR of 200s.
The patient had a b/l femoral u/s which revealed a free floating thrombus in the right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] graft.
However following 3 weeks, his hospital course was additionally complicated by a GIB (see below) and thus a repeat ultrasound was performed to evaluate for the possibility of a persistent thrombi.
The repeat ultrasound showed a patent graft and thus coumadin was discontnued.
His sputum Cx grew out MRSA.
Patient had repeat sputum sent in setting of questionable infiltrate on CXR.
He had an urgent EGD on [**10-5**] which revealed small AVMs in the gastric mucosa.
On admission, patient had worsening CXR with complete right lung collapse, w/ pleural effusions and evidence of consolidation.
Patient underwent a bronchoscopy with removal of obstructing proximal mucous plug with improvment temporarily w/ concordent chest PT and abx.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Secondary: Coronary Artery Disease Peripheral Vascular Disease Mesenteric Ischemia Systolic Congestive Heart Failure Bilateral Pleural Effusions MRSA Pneumonia Sacral Decubitus Ulcer Open Surgical Abdominal Wound Duoadenal Arteriovenous Malformations   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, chest pain-free, improved respiratory status, compensated CHF   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain.
You were found to have had a heart attack and were taken to the cath lab where you had stents placed to open 2 of the arteries supplying your heart.
Additionally, you had a bleed from your gastrointestinal tract, and had an upper endoscopy which showed no active bleeding.
