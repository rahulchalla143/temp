Because his LFT's and synthetic function recovered, he was not a transplant candidate.
2) Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): He developed acute renal failure, with a creatinine that went from 3.5 to a peak of 8.9.
He was oliguric but his urine output did not drop below 500 cc per day.
He developed an anion gap acidosis, peak AG of 25 likely secondary to uremia, and was put on sodium citrate twice daily which he refused to take.
At the time of this summary, his creatinine was 7.6 which had trended down from a peak 2 days previous of 8.9.
His BUN peaked at 64 and was down slightly to 62 at discharge.
This should improve along with creatinine clearance as phosphorous is cleared by the kidney.
If his phosphorous goes above 8, nephrology service recommends Amphogel 30 ml PO TID with meals.
Potassium should be repleted with the following sliding scale: 3.8-4.0 - 20 meq PO KCL 3.6-3.7 - 40 meq PO KCL 3.3-3.5 - 60 meq PO KCL <3.3 - 80 meq PO KCL  Magnesium should be repleted with the following scale: 1.9-2.0 - 400 mg MagOx PO once 1.6-1.8 - 800 mg MagOx PO once <1.5 - 800 mg MagOx PO x 2 doses, 12 hours apart  3) Probable suicide attempt: The patient denied that this was a suicide attempt.
4) HTN - The patient was noted to be consistently slightly hypertensive, and had a systolic blood pressure averaging in the 140's - 150's.
His hematocrit trended down from baseline around 42 to 37 at the time of discharge.
Iron studies showed decreased TIBC and transferrin, and elevated ferritin with normal iron level.
His hematocrit is felt from a medical perspective to be stable at this time.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Tylenol overdose Liver Failure, resolved Acute Renal Failure, resolving probable hypertension Microcytic anemia suicide attempt   Discharge Condition: Patient had > 1000 cc urine output daily.
If you have these symptoms, call your doctor or go to the ER: - lack of urine output - belly pain - nausea/vomiting - headaches/visual changes - feelings of hurting yourself  Followup Instructions: With psychiatry as indicated at discharge from your facility.
You should have basic laboratory tests (CBC, Chem 10, INR) drawn at this time.
