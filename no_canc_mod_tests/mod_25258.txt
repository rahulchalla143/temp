Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2114-8-2**]):    NO GROWTH.
TTE [**7-26**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 75%).
Therefore, follow-up chest CT in three months is recommended to evaluate for interval resolution.
Cultures were obtained and grew out multiple bacteria as detailed in results.
2) Presumed Chronic Right Ventricular Failure: The patient had persistent mild hypoxia in the ICU, sinus tachycardia, and echo showing RV dilation and hypokinesis.
4)  History of pulmonary embolism: Given INR of 12 at presentation and surgery his coumadin was held until INR hit 2.5 at which time it was restarted at half dose (5 mg per day).
Insulin teaching was done and the patient was also sent home with instruction to use insulin to supplement his oral agents.
He had two sets of cardiac enzymes that were negative for signs of infarction.
Transitional Issues: Pt was discharged home with instructions to follow up with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to follow up the results of his chest CT that showed mediastinal LAD.
Outpatient Lab Work Please Have your INR Checked on [**8-3**] and [**8-7**] and faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 34030**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 89095**] 10. simvastatin 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.

After correction your INR went too low, so you are now on coumadin and a medication called lovenox (enoxaparin) to keep your blood thin while your coumadin levels rise to appropriate levels.
At discharge your INR was 1.2.
You will need to have your INR checked on [**8-3**] and [**8-7**].
A CT scan of your chest revealed some lymph nodes in your chest, the significance of which is uncertain.
