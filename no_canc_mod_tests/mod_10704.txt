Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2156-5-24**] at 11:08:18 AM  The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2156-5-31**] at 3:59:26 PM  The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-5-24**], the left ventricular systolic function has improved to normal.
Although this examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the visualized aspects of the upper abdomen are within normal limits.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2156-5-27**] 7:37 AM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarction.
EEG Study Date of [**2156-5-24**] FINDINGS:  SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: No true interictal epileptiform discharges were seen; most of these were detections of somewhat sharply contoured background activity.
A few sharp transients were seen, particularly in the bifrontal region, but these were not definitely epileptiform.
Selected review of the video demonstrated no apparent change in the patient's clinical status in association with these detections.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
EEG Study Date of [**2156-5-31**] FINDINGS: SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: These were artifactual; no true interictal epileptiform discharges were seen.
ROUTINE TIME SAMPLING: Showed a background that did reach a normal alpha frequency at times during wakefulness but was more commonly slow and disorganized often in the theta and delta frequency ranges.
Selected review of the video demonstrated no apparent change in the patient's appearance in association with these periods of sharp blunted theta activity.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
ECG did not demonstrate t-wave inversions, st-elevations, or signs of ischemia, or prolonged QT interval.
An echocardiogram was done that showed normal LA, LV, RV cavity size, mild regional LV dysfunction w/ akinesis of the distal half of the anterior wall and severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 25%).
Echo findings were thought to be secondary to post-cardiac arrest vs underlying cardiomyopathy.
Continous EEG did not show evidence of seizures.
Urine/Serum tox were remarkable for elevated ETOH levels.
Echo on [**5-31**] showed that left ventricular function improved to normal (LVEF 55-60%).
# Infection: Pt began spiking fevers on [**5-26**] to 100.8, she was pancultured and sputum culture eventually revealed coag + staph aureus.
Blood cultures from [**6-3**] and [**6-4**] are NGTD at the time of this summary.
DISPO: [**Hospital3 **] facility - neuro rehab   Medications on Admission: Advair 250/50 Fluticasone 50mcg Levothyroxine 125mcg Fluoxetine 20mg Pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] Triamterene 3.75-25mg  Discharge Medications: 1.
An echocardiogram done before you left the hospital showed that the function of your heart was largely back to normal.
Start Aspirin to prevent a heart attack 3.
Start Heparin injections to prevent a blood clot unless you are up and out of bed at least three times daily 4.
