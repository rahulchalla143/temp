Her creatinine was increased to 2.6 on the floor, after having her PO lasix and lisinopril increased.
Her creatinine had decreased to 2.5 at the time of discharge.
It was felt that it would be reasonable to restart lisinopril at 2.5 qd, and have her electrolytes checked in several days to insure that her renal function has not worsened.
The patient will have her electrolytes checked on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**12-16**], for assessing renal function, and these results should be forwarded to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
