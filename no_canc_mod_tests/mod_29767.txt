[**2153-4-10**] ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2152-10-20**], left ventricular systolic function is now impaired.
[**2153-4-7**] MRI CTL spine: Degenerative disc disease with evidence of spinal stenosis and spinal cord compression in the cervical spine.
[**2153-4-7**] CT Head: Corona radiata hypodensities bilaterally are age-indeterminate in the absence of prior scans.

MRI Head was negative for acute etiology.
Depressed EF - Can't exclude CHF as cause of renal failure, however stroke volume 5.5L per minute.
Hyponatremia: Thought hypovolemic hyponatremia by the floor team, with urine lytes consistent with prerenal syndrome.
Patient was given stress dose steroids, TSH was normal, ECHO with depressed EF to 40%.
Pt was placed on a fluid restriction of 1200ml.
Na was stable at 129-130 at discharge.
# Back/Abdominal Pain: On admission, was initially thought to be secondary to pyelonephritis given dirty u/a and localized to lower abdomen, but given negative urine cultures and imaging, now thought to be most likely related to lumbar spinal stenosis and radiculopathy seen on CT abdomen/pelvis.
MRI head was negative for acute etiology.
Pt is now back on Coumadin, with loading dose of 10mg PO daily to be given on day of discharge at rehab, followed by 5mg PO qday with goal INR [**1-30**].
Pt is on heparin SC, which should be discontinued when INR becomes therapeutic.
As blood pressure is now back to baseline, pt will be discharged on Metoprolol and Lasix, with Hydralazine PRN, and Lisinopril held as renal failure continues to resolve.
