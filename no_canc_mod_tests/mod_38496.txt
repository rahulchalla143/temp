CXR [**11-8**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-7**], the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
Repeat CT showed enlarging R occipital hemorrhage.
INR was reversed with 1u of FFP and 10mg of Vit K. Given her declining neurologic status and poor prognosis, a family meeting was held and the decision was made to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
