Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, edematous.
Cardiovascular examination revealed was irregularly irregular second heart sound and second heart sound.
Pulmonary examination was clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Extremity examination revealed 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed intubated and sedated.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count was 19.3 (with 85 neutrophils, 11 bands, and 3 lymphocytes), hematocrit was 29.4, and platelets were 263.
INR was 4.2 and partial thromboplastin time was 32.5.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 140, potassium was 4.9, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 33, blood urea nitrogen was 57, creatinine was 1.5, and blood glucose was 160.
ALT was 15, AST was 29, alkaline phosphatase was 155, and total bilirubin was 0.4.
Creatine kinase was 58.
Troponin was 1.1.
Urinalysis revealed positive nitrites, greater than 50 red blood cells, 11 to 20 white blood cells, many bacteria.
Calcium was 7.3, magnesium was 2.1, and phosphate was 7.3.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 91, normal axis, and normal intervals.
A chest x-ray #1 initially revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions.
Chest x-ray #2 revealed left lung whiteout/collapse, left mediastinal shift.
Chest x-ray #3 revealed left lung re-expansion, endotracheal tube and subclavian lines in satisfactory position.
A head computed tomography revealed no acute bleeding.
A diagnostic tap was performed of transudative effusion.
Flexible bronchoscopies were performed and secretions were suctioned.
On [**1-29**], a thoracentesis was performed and 1400 cc were removed with 132 glucose, 1.1 protein, LDH 97, albumin 0.4.
At the time of discharge, the patient required pressure support of 10 with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 during the day, and at night pressure support of 15 with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
Beginning on the first week of admission, he began to bleed bright red/melanotic stool and was transfused as needed for maintaining a hematocrit above 30.
Gastroenterology was consulted, and an upper endoscopy was negative for a source of bleeding.
A red blood cell bleeding scan was done which was negative.
Then on [**2-3**], he had a colonoscopy performed for diagnostic purposes which revealed ischemic colitis up to the level of the splenic flexure; however, the colonoscope could not be further advanced.
He received a total 23 units of packed red blood cells to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30.
However, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibodies were sent and returned positive.
At this time, platelets were 87, and Hematology recommended delaying the surgery until his platelets began to rise.
His hematocrit remained stable.
On [**2-16**], his sputum returned methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive, and precautions were initiated.
Surveillance cultures were pending at this time.
His heart rate remained elevated in the 120s to 140s range.
As his digoxin was initially discontinued, it was restarted on [**2-22**], and his heart rate improved minimally.
He was transfused as needed for a hematocrit of less than 30.
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient received a regular insulin sliding-scale as well as insulin in his total parenteral nutrition for a goal blood sugar between 80 and 120 with good control.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient failed a swallow study when he was extubated on [**1-26**].
Albuterol/ipratropium 1 to 2 puffs inhaled q.6h.
