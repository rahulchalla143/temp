Stool culture was done.
However, he did have a chest x-ray done at that time, which was read as normal.
In the emergency room, the labs showed elevated LFTs as well as amylase and lipase.
He had an abdominal CT, which showed peripancreatic multiloculated fluid collection.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the following:  Temperature 102.8, heart rate 144, blood pressure 124/80, respiratory rate 23, oxygen saturation 93% on room air.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
RECTAL:  Examination was guaiac negative in the emergency room.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following: White count 4.7, hematocrit 30.4, platelet count 133,000, neutrophils 95%, lymphocytes 5%, monocytes 1%.
Hemoglobin A1c 6.3, ESR 105, TSH 1.3, CD4 count 73, HIV viral load greater than 100,000, albumin 2.4, AST 302, ALT 173, alkaline phosphatase 153, total bilirubin 0.6, amylase 263, lipase 499.
Urinalysis:  Moderate blood, trace protein, no white blood cells or red blood cells.
Hepatitis B surface antigen and surface antibody negative.
Stool culture on [**4-3**], positive for Shigella flexneri, Gastrodiscus hominis.
Chest x-ray in the emergency room showed clear lungs with dilated loops of bowel.
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 140, normal access, normal intervals, T-wave flattening in leads 1 and AVL.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 46-year-old male with HIV and a CD4 count of 73, who was admitted to the hospital complaining of several-month history of fatigue, weight loss, sweats, and diarrhea.
The focus of his clinical care was initially on his pancreatitis, given his elevated amylase and lipase, elevated transaminases, tender abdomen, and peripancreatic-fluid collection seen on CT examination.
He had further workup for possible tuberculosis including a repeat chest x-ray, which was suspicious for an atypical pneumonia and a chest CT, which showed multiple tiny nodules very suspicious for miliary tuberculosis.
The patient had multiple blood cultures drawn, which were all negative.
He also had a bronchoscopy done on [**4-21**], for bronchial lavage.
The patient had also had an induced sputum done on the 22nd.
Because the patient had a sputum, which was positive for AFB the patient was continued on his respiratory precautions until he had been on his RIPE therapy for two weeks.
His lymph node biopsy also showed E coli, which was sensitive to Ceftriaxone.
However, gradually his enzymes came down again.
He will have a follow up abdominal CT scan to re-evaluate his peripancreatic fluid collection prior to discharge.
The lymph node biopsy was negative for lymphoma.
He received a total of two units of packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 21, prior to the lymph node biopsy.
Cell counts initially came up, however, they began to fall again and a hematology consultation was requested for bone narrow biopsy.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was severely dehydrated initially with a sodium of 117.
He had a workup for his hyponatremia, including a cortisol level, which was normal.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds were done to rule out DVTs of the lower extremities.
