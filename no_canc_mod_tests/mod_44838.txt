Echocardiogram [**2157-12-27**]: Conclusions 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed, EF 35%.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-5-30**], LV function has decreased, and the lateral and inferior motion abnormality is new.

Chest X-ray read was bibasilar atelectasis, but patient with temperatures to 102 degrees the first 2 days of admission and WBC count elevated at 17 on admission and decreased with antibiotics.
Heparin/integrilin started on admission for acute coronary syndrome and d/c'ed on [**12-27**], cardiac enzymes were trending down.
Changed from Atenolol (prior to admission) to Metoprolol and titrated up as heart rate was 95-105 the first few days of admission.
On day of discharge, metoprolol was 150 po bid, heart rate range 60-95 and sbp 100-130.
Monitored cardiac enzymes until trended down, peak CK 2225 on [**12-25**].
On episode of CP/SOB and patient feeling "agitated" on [**12-27**] with no EKG changes, cardiac enzymes continued to decreased, resolved with Lasix, morphine and nitro.
A couple more episodes of "agitation," shortness of breath followed by [**3-3**] chest pressure on [**12-28**] resolved by Alprazolam, sl NTG, no EKG changes and cardiac enzymes continued to decrease.
Will keep BP between 110 - 130 systolic.
UA neg, Blood Cxs, UCx NGTD, CXR likely atelecatasis, but possibly PNA.
Antibiotics changed to Levaquin on [**2157-12-29**] given patient afebrile for several days and white count decreased to within normal limits.
Potassium within normal limits in the few days prior to discharge.
Patient instructed to monitor his blood sugars at home and continued with increased dose of 75/25 insulin.
