Although not included in the scan suspected fractures are also seen in the bones of the hands as described above and dedicated radiographs would be helpful for further evaluation.
[**2156-10-27**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CONCLUSION:  1.
[**2156-10-27**] CT C-spine FINDINGS: The vertebral alignment is unremarkable.
Orthopedic, Spine and Vascular surgery were consulted given his injuries.
There was concern for vascular injury in his right leg and he underwent a CT angiogram which did not reveal any acute injury; upon exam he was neurovascularly intact.
He also required transfusion with packed cells early during his stay for falling hematocrit and hemodynamic instability.
His last hematocrit was 28.7 on [**11-15**].
Because of his injuries there were some pain control issues; he initially required IV narcotics and was later changed to Methadone and Oxycodone which appear to be controlling his pain adequately at this point.
He underwent ultrasound of his upper extremity which revealed non-occlusive thrombus of the right internal jugular vein but no deep vein thrombosis was identified in the right arm.
