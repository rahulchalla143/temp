Her exam was notable for epigastric and left sided abdominal tenderness, but without guarding or rebound tenderness.
She was tachycardic and tremulous, and they were unable to determine if asterixis was present.
Her labs were notable for ALT 60, AST 165, Tbili 0.9, lipase 58, WBC 3.7 (80.8% N), and lactate 4.6.
She had an anion gap of 31, on repeat labs gap was 20.
UA showed 40 ketones and was not suggestive of UTI.
She underwent CT abd/pelvis with contrast, which on prelim read shows minimal pancreatic edema (could be sequela of prior inflammation), no psedocyst, a patent splenic vein, no splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, and fatty liver.
VS prior to transfer were 98.1 88 18 96/50 98% RA.
Lipase at time was 100, suggestive of acute pancreatitis, and CT scan showed severe pancreatitis and an edematous gallbladder wall with gallbladder filled with sludge vs. blood.
Her LFTs at time notable for ALT 230, AST 485.
She underwent EGD which showed erythema in the stomach body compatible with gastritis and mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus; biopsy taken.

Extensive gallbladder wall edema seen on [**2120-11-26**] exam has resolved.
There are multiple scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT OF THE PELVIS:  Bladder is distended.
Intra-abdominal fluid related to prior episode of acute pancreatitis seen on [**2120-11-26**] exam has resolved.
Extensive gallbladder wall edema seen on [**2120-11-26**] exam has resolved.
Focal fat stranding involving the mesenteric fat of the left mid abdomen at the site of prior epiploic appendagitis seen on [**2120-10-26**] exam is less conspicuous today and is likely resolving.
EKG [**4-13**] Sinus tachycardia.
Initially there was concern for pancreatitis, however her lipase was normal and her CT was not strongly suggestive of acute pancreatitis.
It is possible that her pancreas has burned out and thus her lipase levels may not be as elevated.
