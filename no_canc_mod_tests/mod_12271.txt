Admission Date:  [**2145-6-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2145-6-29**]   Service:  MICU GREEN  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of severe coronary artery disease, multiple MIs, type 2 diabetes, congestive heart failure with an EF of less than 25%, who presented to [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital on [**2145-6-23**] with a pale cool right lower extremity.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital6 649**] for further care.
For the above problems, the patient was sent to the MICU after having been found to have a postoperative .................to greater than 50, hematocrit 24.5.
Coronary artery disease, status post MI times two in [**2142**], three vessel disease, not a candidate for CABG or PTCA, based on a catheterization in [**2143**], left main 70%, left circumflex 95%, LAD 80%, RCA 100%.
CHF with an EF of less than 25%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  On presentation, the patient had a temperature of 97.9, pulse 82, blood pressure 134/62, saturating 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities:  The right lower extremity had some firmness in the right calf and Dopplerable pulses and a DP and TP.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On presentation to the MICU, the patient had the following laboratories:  White blood cell count 13.6, hematocrit 33.2 after the 5 units of red blood cells, platelets 186,000.
Her coagulations were 12.8, 57.3, and 1.1.
Her Chem-7 was as follows:  Sodium 144, K 3.9, chloride 112, bicarbonate 14, BUN 36, creatinine 1.6, glucose 268, calcium 8.0, phosphorus 6.3, magnesium 1.9.
Her CK was 8,300 and peaked at around 12,000.
Her troponin was greater than 50.
Her blood gas was 7.29/32/198 with a lactate of 2.8.
EKG showed no ST depressions in V4 through V6.
Chest x-ray showed a hematoma in the left superior mediastinum and a U/A from the outside hospital showed moderate leukocyte esterase and 50-100 white blood cells.
The patient had an echocardiogram which showed small pericardial effusion near the right atrium, no clot, and an ejection fraction, mildly dilated LA, moderately to severely depressed EF of 30%, akinesis at the inferior and posterior walls, hypokinesis of the inferior septum wall, no masses or thrombi.
Mild thickening of the aortic leaflets but no stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, 1+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] tamponade.
On [**2145-6-27**], the patient had the following labs, her white count was 8.3.
Her hematocrit 32.5, platelets 150,000.
BUN 28, creatinine 1.0, and total C02 of 20.
Her U/A showed ten to four times ten to five yeast and a HIT antibody was pending.
The patient was initially treated with heparin which was to be continued after she had the GI bleed and the hematocrit dropped to 24.
She was not deemed a candidate for cardiac catheterization and again the heparin was deemed too risky given the GI bleeds and the falling hematocrit.
The hematocrit was more or less stable in the MICU after receiving 5 units of packed red cells in the PACU.
She needs her hematocrit checked one to two weeks following discharge to ensure that this level is stable.
She was treated with six days of levofloxacin and had no fevers and her white count remained normal during the hospital stay.
Her blood sugars were fairly well controlled.
