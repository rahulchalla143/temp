Electrocardiogram there was read as inferior ST elevations with no change on right-sided leads.
Catheterization revealed 100% right coronary artery occlusion at the stent and underwent Angioject with stent times two proximal and distal to the original stent.
An echocardiogram done at that time to evaluate for tamponade revealed a small effusion without any signs of tamponade physiology.
?, blood pressure 112/53, respirations 20, oxygen saturation 97% on 100% nonrebreather.
Pulmonary:  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
There were 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a hematocrit of 28; creatinine 1.3, initial CK from the outside hospital was 44.
Outside electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, left atrial abnormalities in Q, II, III, and AVF, with ST elevations of 2 mm in II, III, and AVF.
Review of the right-sided electrocardiogram revealed 0.
Electrocardiogram done at [**Hospital6 1760**] revealed ST elevations improved in II, and III, and AVF, as well as reversal of T-wave inversions in I and AVL.
Chest x-ray revealed slight cardiomegaly and sternal wires.
Echocardiogram revealed mild depression of the left ventricle, posterior hypokinesis, trace mitral regurgitation, ejection fraction of 50-55%.
Catheterization revealed 100% right coronary artery stent occlusion.
The patient had a second echocardiogram performed on the evening of admission which revealed no change in the pericardial effusion which was thought to be likely secondary to his surgery.
He was given 1 U packed red blood cells with an appropriate increase in his hematocrit to 28.5 on the day of discharge.
His hematocrit remained stable.
