NCHCT showed slight R MCA hyperdensity but otherwise no early signs of infarct.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] spoke to our stroke fellow, who advised them to give IV tPA, which was given at 14:11.
CTA was done to evaluate for reconstitution of the R MCA after IV tPA, however this showed large clot in the R ICA distal to the bifurcation and absence of the R MCA, with collaterals providing some flow distally, as well as clot within the R A1 segment.
His BP and sugar were elevated, but not outside a typical range for him (BP 208/109, glucose 300s).
-DTRs: Plantar response was flexor on R, and mute on L.  -Coordination: intact FNF on R  NIH Stroke Scale score was 17: 1a.

NCHCT [**2197-6-28**]  IMPRESSION:  Extensive hemorrhagic transformation of the acute right MCA territorial infarction, with new right basal ganglionic, intraventricular, and subdural hemorrhage.
The post-procedure head CT showed hemorrhagic conversion.
Within a few hours, he had further deterioration in his examination and repeat scan showed extensive hemorrhagic conversion in stroke territory.
