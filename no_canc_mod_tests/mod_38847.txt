After administering the Motrin, she took oral temperature which was 101.2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 101.8, blood pressure 132/68, pulse 88, respiratory rate 14.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - She is normocephalic and atraumatic.
Funduscopic examination is benign.
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities - 2+ pulses times four, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no joint effusions and no changes to nails.
Dermatologic - no jaundice or pallor, no rashes appreciated.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood count 3.0, hemoglobin 11.1, hematocrit 35.0, platelets 263,000, MCV 70.
Sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate 22, blood urea nitrogen 17, creatinine 1.0, glucose 88.
Urinalysis showed 11 white blood cells and trace ketone.
The chest x-ray on admission was normal with no infiltrates or effusions.
Electrocardiogram was read as normal.
An emergent AP film showed ill-defined opacity of the right lung base and to a lesser extent in the left lower lobe.
Her examination was noteworthy for crackles at the right base.
Repeat chest x-ray showed bilateral posterobasal segment consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
Peripheral blood cultures were ordered and were negative.
The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit were noted to be falling.
The patient's liver function tests were noted to be ALT 199, AST 99, LDH 428, alkaline phosphatase 144, total bilirubin 1.5.
Direct Coombs test was negative and reticulocyte count was 0.08.
Her arterial blood gases was pH 7.47, 24, 60, 18 and -3 on ten liters oxygen.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations and possibility of small pleural effusions.
She was placed on 15 liters, 100% nonrebreather and her arterial blood gases was 7.45, 32, 52, 23, 0.
Chest x-ray showed increase in bilateral air space opacities consistent with pneumonic consolidation, adult respiratory distress syndrome.
The patient's hematocrit which had been 33.0 on admission was now 24.0.
The patient was transfused with one unit of blood and her hematocrit responded appropriately.
A PEEP compliance curve was plotted on [**2169-8-4**], finding the PEEP of 12 to be optimal.
The patient had much better oxygen saturation when sitting up at 30 to 45 degrees.
Chest x-ray continued to show adult respiratory distress syndrome, most likely secondary to malarial infection.
The patient's PCP and bacterial cultures were noted to be negative.
Fungal culture was positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans, likely a benign colonizer.
Legionella was negative and acid fast bacilli and viral culture were negative.
An echocardiogram was performed to rule out pulmonary edema.
Echocardiogram showed borderline pulmonary artery hypertension.
CT of the head, chest and abdomen on [**2169-8-8**], were negative for any intracranial pathology.
Her low hematocrit was considered likely secondary to direct effects of malarial infection, low grade hemolysis and underlying iron deficiency.
She was transfused a total of four units packed red blood cells, started on iron sulfate, but this was discontinued as she could not take anything p.o.
Parenteral iron was not started as the risk of anaphylaxis was greater than the potential benefit.
A reticulocyte count was inappropriately low and she was started on Epogen 40,000 units subcutaneous every week.
The patient's coagulation studies which were normal on admission had then become abnormal.
Her prothrombin time and INR were rising which was thought to be secondary to malnutrition.
Albumin was noted to be 1.6.
She had ascites on CT scan on [**2169-8-8**], and was reported to have no bowel sounds in the Intensive Care Unit on [**2169-8-7**], and [**2169-8-8**].
Culture grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
For example, the patient who required transfusion for hematocrit of 25.0 was denied this transfusion by her husband for a period of two days until he finally agreed on the last day that she was on the regular medical floor before being transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
