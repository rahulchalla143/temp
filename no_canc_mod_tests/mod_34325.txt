[**4-4**] UCx - negative  Imaging:  CT head [**4-2**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
Further evaluation could be obtained by either a CT venogram or a dedicated MRI of the orbits.
EEG [**4-5**] - pending  ECHO [**4-5**]:  The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
CTA chest [**4-5**]:  IMPRESSIONS:  1.
Follow-up chest CT is recommended to show resolution in several months if clinically appropriate given the mass-like apppearance of a consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe.
A lung mass cannot be excluded at that site.
He presented to outside hospital with GCS 10 and found to have a right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MRI/A/V of head was obtained and showed no VST, AVM as causes of SAH, but did reveal a R subgaleal hematoma.
BP was maintained to goal of < 160, however, due to significant patient agitation at times would reach nearly 180 systolic.
CT head was repeated and showed improved SAH.
His agitation improved after transfer to the floor.
His neurologic exam on day of discharge was significant for normal mental status, normal cranial nerve exam, muscle strength full throughout, and slight pronator drift on the right.
EKG showed RV strain and ECHO showed no WMA w/ EF 60% and RV borderline function.
CTA was performed to r/o PE and was negative, revealing however pulmonary edema and b/l effusions.
Patient had one positive BCx ([**2-6**]) on [**4-2**] from the ED felt to be contaminant.
Blood culture on [**2113-4-7**] grew gram positive rods.
Repeat blood culture on [**2113-4-9**] and central line tip culture on [**4-9**] were negative after 48 hours.
Outpatient Cardiac Rehab Program 13.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Admission Diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage Secondary Diagoses: -HTN -diabetes -HLD -CAD -Anxiety   Discharge Condition: His neurologic exam on day of discharge was significant for normal mental status, normal cranial nerve exam, muscle strength full throughout, and slight pronator drift on the right.
While hospitalized you had remarkable episodes of agitation leading to elevated blood pressures and cardiac stress leading to enzyme leakage but no heart attack.
You were evaluated by physical therapy who recommended that you would benefit from an outpatient cardiac rehab program to improve your endurance and cardiac function.
