A chest x-ray was done that showed clear lung fields bilaterally with a normal cardiac silhouette.
The x-rays also had some nonspecific increased markings.
A swallow study was done which showed abnormal incoordination in the micro-aspiration.
A Neurological work-up included an MRI of the brain and brainstem which was normal, and reviewed by the consulting neurology team.
Results from the Newborn Screening Tests were within normal limits following an initial elevated TSH.
Due to the fact that the swallowing study showed evidence of micro-aspiration, on NG lavage tube feedings were done.
In light of the results of the above tests mentioned and the fact that Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname **]' stridor is improving slowly, no further ENT procedures, i.e., bronchoscopy, was done.
The plan for now is to repeat a swallowing study in one week and follow-up with ENT in one week after the swallowing study.
