An ultrasound demonstrated poor hepatic flow in the liver.
A subsequent angio was performed on [**12-25**], which demonstrated very poor flow to the liver and a very tight stenosis in the vicinity of the anastomosis.
On [**12-27**], he underwent a Doppler ultrasound of the liver demonstrating normal wave forms to the hepatic artery and again, no left hepatic arterial flow was visualized.
His liver function tests came back to normal and on postoperative day 4 after his second procedure while in the intensive care unit, he arose from a chair and while moving to the bed, became significantly hypoxic and hypotensive.
His initial pH was 7.1 on the blood gas with significant hypoventilation.
He underwent a CTPA which did not demonstrate any evidence of a pulmonary embolus.
CT scan of the head was performed, which did not demonstrate any pathologic lesion.
His liver function tests remained normal.
He did have a rise in his liver function tests on [**2178-1-5**] prompting a follow-up ultrasound which demonstrated no hepatic arterial flow to the liver.
