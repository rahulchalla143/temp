Subsequent evaluation showed severely depressed LVEF, 20-25%, with elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures.
A diagnostic left- and right-heart cath was performed, and attempted PCI to mid-LAD was unsuccessful.
The patient was evaluated by CT surgery, and was determined to be a poor surgical candidate.
Iron studies did not show evidence of hemachromatosis.
Her exercise capacity and level of activity have been limited over the past few months due to progressive DOE.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-9-11**], the right ventricular cavity is slightly larger with more severe free wall hypokinesis.
Although patient ruled out for an acute ischemic event, echo showed progression of cardiac dysfunction with an EF of 20%, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and severe RV dysfunction with free wall hypokinesis.
At FS 150 start at 2 units and increase by 2 unit for every additional 50 point rise in blood glucose.
