Admission Date:  [**2140-3-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2140-4-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2088-2-1**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Purple-Bariatric Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51 year old gentleman with Class 3 morbid obesity with a weight of 358 pounds and a body mass index of 53 who was referred to the Bariatric Surgery Program after failing several attempts at weight loss.
His medical morbidities included insulin dependent diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus with difficult to control hemoglobin A1c consistently above 8, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea.
His electrolytes were checked and repleted and the patient at that time reported a history of some palpitations and "irregular heart beat," associated with his pneumonia.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and he ruled out for myocardial infarction.
His rate over the course of the next few days was relatively well controlled and he was noted to go in and out of atrial fibrillation.
He had an echocardiogram performed which showed a normal ejection fraction.
He was having fever spikes and a chest x-ray done showed a retrocardiac infiltrate consistent with a ventilator-associated pneumonia for which he was started on Levaquin.
He had a repeat Methylene Blue test that was again negative for any leak or contrast extravasation.
He had a computerized tomography scan of his abdomen done because of fevers and this did not show any intra-abdominal abscess infiltrate and no collections.
He initially had some diarrheal stools, however, his tube feeds were decreased and his ileostomy output decreased as well with that.
His renal function had deteriorated somewhat with an increase in his creatinine to 1.5 from 1.0, however, on postoperative day #15, his creatinine bumped to 2.4.
His volume status was closely monitored and his creatinine eventually plateaued at 2.4 and subsequently decreased at the time of this dictation.
Of note, due to the large amount of volume given perioperatively, diuresis with intravenous Lasix was initiated, however, that was subsequently discontinued when the rising creatinine was noted.
He currently has a 24 hour urine electrolytes pending.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] was initially NPO, however, he was started on tube feeds on postoperative day #12 at a low dose.
Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] initially was placed on the standard subcutaneous heparin, however, his multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation over the hospital course he was heparinized and Coumadin was started for goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
Abdominal computerized tomography scan was done as mentioned before and showed no abscess, however, his chest x-ray did show a retrocardiac density for which he was started on Levofloxacin to which he has completed a 14 day course.
Endocrine - In the immediate postoperative period his blood glucoses were difficult to control requiring an insulin drip and large amounts of daily insulin.
for a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
He should have his INR checked daily or every other day until he is at a steady state.
