No evidence of interval subarachnoid or other intracranial hemorrhage since the pre-procedure examinations of [**2147-6-26**].
Status post initial coiling of the large, lobulated left carotid terminus and possible carotico-ophthalmic aneurysm; however, the current examination suggests that there is still patency and flow within both the superior- anterior portion of the aneurysm which may, in fact, be carotico-ophthalmic, as well as a small amount of flow into the more posterior mid-portion of the aneurysm.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**8-23**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Retained contrast within the renal collecting systems, as well as vicarious excretion of contrast from the gallbladder, presumably from patient's recent angiogram.
CTA Head [**8-24**]: FINDINGS: Patient is status post coiling of a large left ICA aneurysm.
Limited evaluation due to streak artifact from coils.
MRA Brain [**8-25**]: BRAIN MRI: There are areas of hyperintensity on the diffusion and T2-weighted and FLAIR images in the left frontal and parietal regions with several tiny foci in the subcortical region indicative of infarcts.
MRA HEAD: The pre and post-contrast MRA of the head demonstrate subtle enhancement within the coil pack indicating the thrombus.
The evaluation of the left supraclinoid internal carotid on projection images is somewhat limited secondary to artifacts from the adjacent coil pack.
She underwent an MRI/MRA to evaluate her left ICA aneurysm which was reviewed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Her blood pressures during her admission at [**Hospital1 18**] through [**2147-8-21**] were normal off of this medication, so it was not restarted.
She was taken for a stat head CTA which showed patent vessels.
Her blood pressure is to be kept between 140-160.
She was transferred to the floor with the heparin drip and SBP 140-160.
Her right sided symptoms did not return.
She remained neurologically intact, she will follow up this week with her primary care to have her INR and coumadin monitored.
Outpatient Physical Therapy Please treat and evaluate s/p subarachnoid hemorrhage and right leg fx   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: pulmonary embolism left internal carotid artery aneurysm   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for a blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolism) and surgical management of your intracranial aneuysm.
You should be on blood thinners to treat this clot for a total of 3 months.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
Followup Instructions: Please make an appointment with your primary care physician as soon as possible to have your INR drawn and follow up for Pulmonary embolism Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**] to [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] and appointment to be seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 6 months you will need an MRA at that time.
Have a CD of your MRI sent back to Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]  Please also call your Primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] an appointment for blood work(INR) to be drawn within the next two days.
