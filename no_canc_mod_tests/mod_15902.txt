A dedicated CT of the right temporal bone was performed and there was no fracture of the inner ear, therefore, it was assumed to be a cerebrospinal fluid leak.
Also early in the morning of [**2141-3-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 46630**] was noted to be hypotensive with a blood pressure in the 80s over 50s.
His glycemic control was also poor with blood sugars in the 400s overnight.
He was also placed on an insulin drip and pan cultures were sent for a possible infectious disease workup.
Notable laboratories upon transfer were continued problems with glycemic control with blood sugars in the 400s as well as elevated transaminases.
Cardiac enzymes were also sent.
CK, creatinine kinase enzymes were sent and were all negative, however, his troponins were elevated.
Initial troponin was 10 and they were subsequently 8 and 5.1.
At this point the Cardiology service was asked to consult on Mr. [**Known lastname 46630**] and their conclusion was that the troponins were elevated suggesting myocardial damage but not acute coronary syndrome in etiology.
They recommended a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor as his blood pressure tolerated.
An echocardiogram was also obtained.
The ejection fraction was 55%.
Compared to the echocardiogram dated [**2141-2-28**] there was severe dilatation and hypokinesis of the right ventricle and there was suspicion for a pulmonary embolism on that echocardiogram.
A CT scan-angiogram of the chest on the early morning of [**2141-3-16**], revealed large bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Once the lumbar drain was discontinued Mr. [**Known lastname 46630**] was switched to Lovenox therapy as a bridge towards Coumadin therapy with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.
Blood draws for INR/PT levels every two to three days until a goal INR is achieved.
Goal INR should be 2.5 to 3.0.
until INR is therapeutic.
Hold for systolic blood pressure less than 120.
Hold for heart rate less than 60 or systolic blood pressure less than 120.
