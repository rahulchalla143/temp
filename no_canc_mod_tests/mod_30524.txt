At the time of admission, the patient was intubated with profound neurological deficits including an absent corneal reflex, absent pupillary reflex, absent gag reflex, no spontaneous movement in her extremities, and did not show any response to painful stimuli.
Neurology was consulted on the evening of admission, and the patient underwent a head CT which was negative for acute hemorrhage.
An EEG was performed the following day which showed bursts of theta/delta activity and suppressive bursts are all compatible with a post-anoxic encephalopathy of moderate degree.
The patient underwent a repeat EEG a few days following admission, which showed no EEG rhythms seen, this tracing shows worsening compared to the prior EEG and is suggestive of a poor prognosis.
Cardiac- In terms of her cardiac disease, the patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed the left atrium to be moderately dilated, the right atrium is moderately  dilated, the left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
An exact EF cannot be determined.
Her electrolytes were carefully monitored and replaced to avoid precipitating further arrhythmias.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable without further intervention.
The patient was treated with a ten day course of antibiotics and blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures were all negative for any significant growth.
Renal- the patient's creatinine at the time of admission was 2.1 and rose to 4.0, at which point the patient also became oliguric, likely secondary to ATN.
The patient's urine output eventually improved and creatinine trended down to baseline.
Thyroid studies were sent and returned normal.
As her neurological exam remained unchanged throughout her hospitalization, a number of conversations were had with her husband and family about goals of care and prognosis.
