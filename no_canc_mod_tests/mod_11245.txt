Cardiac catheterization took place on [**2-2**] prior to admission which showed a heavily calcified aortic valve that could not be crossed with guide wires.
He echocardiogram on [**2195-12-16**] showed a calcific aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.6 cm2 with a peak gradient of 60.
The patient had a depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 30%, and pulmonary hypertension, as well as moderate mitral regurgitation.
Status post lumbar disc operation in [**2147**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination, the patient's blood pressure was 108/72 and heart rate was 72 in sinus rhythm.
His peripheral pulses were palpable.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Preoperative laboratory results revealed white blood cell count was 4.8 and hematocrit was 45.9.
White blood cell count was 4.8 and platelet count was 154,000.
Sodium was 140, potassium was 4.4, chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was 16, creatinine was 1.3.
INR was 1.2.
Additional preoperative laboratory work revealed ALT was 19, AST was 27, alkaline phosphatase was 70, and total bilirubin was 0.6.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Cardiac catheterization on [**2-2**] showed no significant coronary artery obstruction, severe aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, and biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Preoperative electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm with atrial ectopy and a long P-R interval, as well as some ST-T wave abnormalities in multiple leads, with a question of left ventricular hypertrophy.
A preoperative chest x-ray showed a slightly enlarged heart and a small 5-mm lung nodule in the right posterior lung field.
Blood pressure was 120/60, in a sinus rhythm at 80, with a cardiac index of 2.4.
Postoperative laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 6, hematocrit was 33, and platelet count was 160,000.
Sodium was 139, potassium was 4.5, chloride was 108, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 110.
Chest tube output was significant enough not to pull the chest tubes on postoperative day.
On postoperative day two, the patient remained in a sinus rhythm with a stable hematocrit of 31.7.
Blood urea nitrogen was 23 and creatinine was 1.
Blood pressure was 119/57.
The examination was benign.
The patient remained in a sinus rhythm with a good blood pressure of 120/80 and was saturating 95% on room air.
The physical examination was benign.
