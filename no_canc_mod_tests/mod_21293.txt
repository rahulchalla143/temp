Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
ECHO Study Date of [**2115-4-25**] Conclusions: There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2115-4-25**]  COMMENTS: 1.
Selective coronary angiography was performed which revealed a right dominant system.
The patient became hypotensive to SBP in the 70s by noninvasive measurement with a HR of 105.
Her pressure did not respond to atropine.
An emergent echo was done, which showed a large pericardial effusion with signs worrisome for tamponade.
Pericardiocentesis was performed via the subxyphoid approach with removal of approximately 700 cc of bloody fluid.
RA pressure fell from fell from 31 mm Hg to 22 mm Hg and SBP increased from 80 to 120 mm Hg after the pericardiocentesis was performed.
Endomyocardial biopsy was performed.

Underwent liver biopsy that showed:Liver, allograft, transjugular biopsy:    1.
Trichrome and reticulin stains show no significant fibrosis.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2114-8-14**], contractile function of the left and right ventricular function is profoundly depressed.
ABDOMINAL DOPPLER US DONE SHOWED:Flow is identified within the main hepatic artery, but no definite intrahepatic arteries were visualized with flow.
Patient was transferred to SICU for further management, cardiology heart failure was involved in patient care, recommended gentle diuresis.
Patient at that point with mean bp 55-60 and SBP 80's.
*** Large pericardial effusion**** On [**2115-4-25**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization for right ventricular biopsy to assess the cause of her biventricular heart failure.
Her cardiac index in the cath lab was 1.6 with an output of 3.1 with the following pressures:  RA 28/26/23 RV 47/21 PA 47/28/37 Wedge mean 29 SVR 1832   The results of her cardiac biopsy are still pending.
Her catheterization was complicated by a right ventricular perforation which resulted in a large pericardial effusion with evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse and tamponade.
As a result, a pericardial drain had to be placed and the patient was transferred to the CCU.
Repeat serial echos showed, with the drain in place, resolved pericardial effusion.
The last echocardiogram was performed on [**2115-4-28**] and should be repeated on [**2115-5-1**] with monitoring daily of a pulsus and signs of tamponade.
*****Congestive heart failure, EF <10%****** Unclear etiology.
A swan was placed and showed an index of 1.83 before inotropy was initiated.
She was placed on milrinone 0.375 with an index of 2.42 which was titrated up to 0.4 with an index of 2.69, SVR of 880.
Her blood pressure dropped and thus the ACE was discontinued.
Her CXR shows severe CHF and thus an infiltrate cannot be excluded.
However, while on prednisone, her blood sugars have been elevated.
She was followed while an inpatient by our diabetic specialists at the [**Hospital **] Clinic who recommended maintaining her on lantus QHS and a sliding scale of insulin.
