At OSH, pt had CT scan of Left hip which showed a cervical neck fracture of the left proximal femur.
She had a routine pre-op evaluation; however her pre-op EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V4.
Her SOB was at baseline.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
Her cardiac cath earlier today showed clean coronaries.
She refuses to go to get x-rays for further evaluation.

Cardiac Catheterization [**2126-4-12**] 1.
Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:  --the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease --the LAD had no angiographically apparent disease --the LCX had no angiographically apparent disease --the RCA had a calcified proximal 50% stenosis.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated systemic arterial systolic pressures, with SBP 156 mmHg.

Increased IVC diameter (>2.1cm) with <35% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (10-20mmHg).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
[**2126-4-13**] CXR The lung volumes are near normal, the hemidiaphragms are relatively low, but not flattened.
[**2126-4-13**] CTA CHEST Preliminary Report !!
Brief Hospital Course: 1) EKG changes - Perioperative EKG prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] showed ST elevations in V3-V4 and to a lesser extent in II,III,F,V5-V6.
A similar EKG was obtained upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Cardiac cath [**4-12**] revealed a right-dominant system with a calcified 50% proximal stenosis in the RCA but no angiographically apparent disease in the LMCA, LAD, and LCX.
TTE [**2126-4-12**] revealed normal left atrial size with an estimated right atrial pressure 10-20mmHg, normal left ventricular wall thickness and a small left ventricular cavity, normal left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 70%), hypertrophied right ventricular free wall, dilated right ventricular cavity with borderline normal free wall function, abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload, moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets with a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets, left ventricular inflow pattern suggesting impaired relaxation, mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets with moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation, and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Cardiac enzymes were trended with no elevation in her CK's threfore this was felt not to be cardiac ischemia.
2) Pulmonary Embolus - On hospital day 2, the patient had low-grade fever, tachycardia, worsening hypoxemia with resting oxygen saturation in the mid 90's on 6 L NC, new T-wave inversions in V3 and deeper T-wave inversions in V4.
CTA of the chest revealed right middle lobe segmental pulmonary emboli, right middle lobe pulmonary infarct vs. atelectasis, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and volume overload.
Lower extremity doppler ultrasound was negative for DVT.
However, based on the preference of the patient and her family, she was transferred to [**Hospital3 3583**] for further management.
