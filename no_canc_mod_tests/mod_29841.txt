Patient was recently re-admitted for further evaluation of hypotension from his rehab facility.
An ECHO done during that admission ([**3-3**]) showed a moderate amount of pericardial fluid, mostly overlying the left ventricle and comparatively little fluid over the right ventricular free wall.
He went to see his cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in clinic today, who repeated echocardiogram and checked a pulsus, which was high at 20mmHg.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-3-3**], the effusion may be slightly larger.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-3-10**], the pericardial effusion has been completely drained.
CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber without dissection.
A right hilar lymph node conglomerate at the level of the bifurcation of the bronchus intermedius measures 7 x 22 mm (5:55), which may be reactive due to the right complex effusion but followup is recommended.
The study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Right hilar lymphadenopathy may be reactive, but follow up with chest CT is recommended in three months to ensure resolution.
[**Doctor Last Name **] ([**2155-3-17**]): The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-3-13**], no change.
Cytology: [**2155-3-13**] Pleural effusion cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS [**2155-3-12**] Pleural effusion cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

# Loculated pericardial effusion: Patient presented with a pericardial effusion with pulsus paradoxus of 20; [**Year (4 digits) **] on admission did not show signs of cardiac tamponade.
The patient's cultures grew out Staph epidermidis, a separate coag negative Staph and Micrococcus; however, this was thought to be due to contamination, so antiobitics were not started.
EBV serologies were sent and were negative for acute EBV infection.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
The patient had serial [**Location (un) **]'s through the admission that showed trivial pericardial effusions with no evidence of tamponade.
The pleural fluid collected from thoracentesis was negative for malignant cells, and the cultures were also negative.
A Chest CT was done to further evaluate pleura to determine if there was pleural pathology that could explain the eosinophilia present in the pleural fluid.
Chest CT did not find any plerual-based pathology.

The fluid culture grew multiple bacteria, which we think was not a true infection after speaking with our infectious disease team.
You will also need a repeat ultrasound of the heart 2 months after discharge  You were also noted to have a collection of fluid around your right lung, for which you underwent a thoracentesis (drainage of the fluid collection) and had a drain in place to drain the collection, which was removed prior to discharge.
