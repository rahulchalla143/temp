In the Emergency Room, his temperature was 98.3, blood pressure was 183/65, pulse was 94, respiratory rate was 12, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.
His initial electrocardiogram was unremarkable.
He was given sublingual nitroglycerin for his chest pain.
However, in the Emergency Room, his systolic blood pressure dropped to the 50s and heart rate went down to the 40s.
His repeat electrocardiogram showed high-grade atrioventricular block with acute inferior myocardial infarction.
During the catheterization, an intra-aortic balloon was placed for blood pressure support, and he was intubated for airway protection.
At the end of the catheterization, his heart rate remained stable off pacer, and blood pressure remained stable off pressors.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission to catheterization laboratory revealed temperature was 96.9, blood pressure was 136/71, heart rate was 133.
Cardiovascular examination revealed normal first heart sound and second heart sound, tachycardic.
Lungs revealed breath sounds were equal bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 9.6, hematocrit was 48.4, platelets were 179.
PT was 13.5, PTT was 25.5, INR was 1.3.
Sodium was 136, potassium was 4.5, chloride was 95, bicarbonate was 31, blood urea nitrogen was 9, creatinine was 0.7, and blood glucose was 414.
Calcium was 8.7, magnesium was 1.5, phosphate was 4.2.
Albumin was 3.9, total bilirubin was 0.7, ALT was 20, AST was 14, alkaline phosphatase was 85, lipase was 13, amylase was 24, LD was 196, creatine kinase was 45 (which later peaked at 1081).
Arterial blood gas revealed 7.31/47/358 on ventilator with FIO2 of 0.8.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in II, III, and aVF; ST elevations in I and aVL; right-sided electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in leads V2 through V6.
Catheterization in [**2148-9-21**] revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease, patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.
Catheterization in [**2149-7-21**] revealed 2-vessel coronary artery disease, patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.
Ejection fraction was about 70%.
Catheterization on admission revealed left main coronary artery was normal, left anterior descending artery with severe proximal disease, left circumflex was nondominant with total occlusion of the first obtuse marginal.
Right heart catheterization showed right atrial mean pressure of 19, pulmonary artery pressure of 57/40, with a mean pressure of 49, wedge of 28.
Metoprolol and Cozaar were added as his blood pressure tolerated.
The 18-hour course of post catheterization Integrilin had to be stopped prematurely due to epistaxis.
His cardiac enzymes trended downward throughout the hospital stay with a peak creatine kinase of 1081 and CK/MB of 125.
Repeat echocardiogram showed inferoseptal hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 55%.
