Patient initially refused a NGT and foley catheter.
She underwent serial examinations with improvement in her abdominal pain.
COMPARISON: CT [**2199-5-23**].
They initially recommended stool cultures (negative), a clear liquid diet, and observation for clinical improvement.
The patient was later ordered for an MR enterography, however, her diarrhea improved prior to obtaining the study.
An Anti-transglutaminase was sent to evaluate for Celiac disease and was in the normal range.
The sensitivities returned on the urine culture, and was resistant to Bactrim.
On HD # 11, blood cultures were sent and returned with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Parapsilosis.
Unfortunately, the sensitivities showed that the [**Female First Name (un) **] was resistant to fluconazole and oral therapy was not available.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-5-27**], left ventricular systolic function is less dynamic and increased PCWP is now suggested.
# Renal on [**2199-9-24**] the patient was noted to have hyponatremia with a sodium of 130.
She had a nadir of 129.
She further was noted to have worsening of her creatinine (baseline 1.0-1.2).
As the creatinine continued to elevate, nephrology was consulted.
She had intermittent periods where her systolic blood pressure was 220s with diastolics in the 110s.
If her blood pressure is not well controlled, we would recommend increasing her amlodipine to 5 mg PO daily.
The patient's urine output was low on occasion and she did require small boluses of IVF.
Her creatinine peaked at 2.0 and has continued to trend down.
Her most recent creatinine was 1.6 on [**2199-10-2**].
Her sodium and creatinine should be monitored in her extended care facility.
On [**2199-9-21**], the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 21.1 due to blood loss on top of anemia of chronic disease and she was transfused 2units of pRBCs with appropriate increase in hematocrit.
COMPARISON: CT head, most recently of [**2199-8-3**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial imaging was performed through the brain before and after administration of 90 mL of IV Optiray 350.
CT HEAD BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or large vascular territory infarction is seen.
While the current study is not tailored towards the study of such, there is apparent normal enhancement of the vessels of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
If there remains concern for subtle process, MRI would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation  While down at CT, the patient reportedly exhibited further seizure activity and she received Ativan.
EEG on [**2199-9-14**]: FINDINGS: ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a 9 Hz predominant biposterior rhythm in the most awake parts of this recording.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
EEG [**2199-9-15**]: FINDINGS: ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a 9 Hz predominant biposterior rhythm in wakefulness.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
An MRI/MRA of the brain was ordered, however, the patient was not able to comply with the study for several days.
The study was obtained on [**2199-9-19**]:  HISTORY: 67-year-old female patient with osteomyelitis and discitis.
TECHNIQUE: MRI of the head was performed with and without IV contrast and MRA of the brain was also performed.
COMPARISON: CT scan dated [**2199-9-12**].
There is mucosal thickening of the bilateral ethmoid air cells and a mucus-retention cyst in the right sphenoid sinus.
A L spine MRI was obtained:  LUMBAR SPINE MRI.
COMPARISON: Prior lumbar spine MRIs, [**2191-4-11**] through [**2199-7-24**].
IMPRESSION: Incomplete examination demonstrates grossly similar appearance to the previous MRI from [**7-24**] on limited sagittal T2 seqeunce.
Complete study to be performed when pt.
A repeat lumbar spine MRI is recommended as an outpatient if clinically indicated.
