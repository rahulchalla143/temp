He ruled in for a myocardial infarction with his peak creatine kinase of 311 and a troponin level of 35.
At that time he received aspirin, Lovenox, nitroglycerin paste, Lopressor 50 mg p.o., and Lasix 40 mg intravenously for hypoxia and a chest x-ray which was consistent with congestive heart failure.
Prior cardiac studies included his ejection fraction was 60% in [**2159-2-6**].
In [**2161-2-6**], his exercise MIBI was 53% maximum predicted heart rate, but no symptoms of chest pain, and no electrocardiogram changes.
His ejection fraction at that time was 43%.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.3 to 2.5.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His laboratories on the morning after admission were a white blood cell count of 6.6, hematocrit of 24.2 (which had dropped down from 29), platelets of 186.
Sodium of 142, potassium of 3.8, chloride of 106, bicarbonate of 27, blood urea nitrogen of 59, creatinine of 2.5 (up from 2.3), and a glucose of 147.
INR was 1.2, PT of 13.3, PTT of 72.
Creatine kinase was 146, troponin of 17.3.
Calcium of 7.9, albumin of 3.6, magnesium of 1.9.
Total cholesterol of 158, LDL of 93.
He had dropped his hematocrit to 23.5.
He had no further chest pain, and on [**3-16**] he underwent an echocardiogram (please see report for full details).
In summary, the echocardiogram revealed severe global hypokinesis with severe inferolateral involvement.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization (please see report for full details).
In summary, the cardiac catheterization revealed a 40% occlusion of right coronary artery, 80% occlusion of the left main, 90% occlusion of circumflex, with an ejection fraction of 20% to 25%.
On postoperative day one, a nitroglycerin drip was started for mean arterial pressures of greater than 90.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  At the time of discharge, the patient's physical examination was as follows:  Vital signs revealed temperature of 97.7, heart rate of 63 in normal sinus rhythm, respiratory rate of 18, and blood pressure of 129/65.
His oxygen saturation was 99% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equal and reactive to light.
Skin revealed sternal wound was intact with no drainage, and the EVH incision performed on the left thigh was intact, slightly scabbed over.
His weight on discharge was 96.9 kg.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  The most recent laboratory data from yesterday was a white blood cell count of 8.1, hematocrit of 26.5, platelets of 253.
Sodium of 140, potassium of 4.5, chloride of 105, bicarbonate of 24, blood urea nitrogen of 54, creatinine of 2.8.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.3 to 2.5.
