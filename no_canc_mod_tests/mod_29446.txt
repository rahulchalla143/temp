Friday he was evaluated in the emergency department for left arm pain, CT abdomen completed and was unremarkable and EKG reassuring.
Left arm pain continued intermittent and waxing at first and without other associated symptoms and denying chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, or DOE.
EKG in the ED revealed ST segment elevations in leads II, III and aVF (III>II) with also lateral V5, V6 ST segment elevations.
Cath revealed occlusion of RCA which was stented.
Cath also revealed proximal LAD disease and high Diag vs Ramus disease.
Hemodynamically stable with SBPs in 130s and Hrs in 60s.

Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic arterial hypertension with transient bradycardia and hypotension resolved with 0.5mg atropine.
Left-sided filling pressure was mildly elevated with LVEDP of 24 mmHg.
-   Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2109-3-23**] at 12:24:25 PM FINAL  -  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF = 45 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior free wall, hypokinesis of the inferior septum, and hypokinesis of the apex (with a small area of focal apical dyskinesis).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
IMPRESSION: inferior and apical contractile dysfunction  - CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2109-3-23**] 6:27 AM -  FINDINGS: No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen on this single view.
He remained hemodynamically stable and without conduction abnormalities on EKG and telemetry.
TTE showed mildly depressed EF 45%, with akinesis of the inferior free wall, hypokinesis of the inferior septum, and hypokinesis of the apex.

START taking lisinopril to lower your blood pressure and help your heart recover from the heart attack.
START taking metoprolol to slow your heart rate and help your heart recover fromt the heart attack.
