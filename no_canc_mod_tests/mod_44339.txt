The patient underwent a repeat endoscopy on [**2192-2-20**] to follow-up on a prior diagnosed duodenal ulcer.
A repeat endoscopy was done since the patient had been experiencing continued melena.
The endoscopy showed that the prior diagnosed duodenal ulcer was healing.
As per the patient's attending, given that the patient had remained stable and had had a prior colonoscopy two years ago which had showed polyps, he felt as though the patient could be discharged home and have the colonoscopy as an outpatient.
Prior to his appointment with Urology, he was told to call Radiology for a time slot to have a repeat CT scan to assess the size of the fluid collections.
He was also told to call Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5061**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5062**] office to schedule a colonoscopy within the next one to two months.
