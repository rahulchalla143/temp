EKG showed NSR at 90 bpm with Q waves in V1-V3, slight ST elevations in V3-V4 and prolonged QT, which were all unchanged from before.
Labs notable for BNP 2398, K 3.1 and WBC 12.2 with 82% PMNs.
Troponin was 0.01 and lactate 1.7.
Blood cultures were drawn.
EKG in the ED showed NSR at 90 bpm with Q waves in V1-V3.
CT head did not demonstrate any evidence of intracranial lesions/hemorrhage/masses, but there is sinus opacification.

The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
A complete transthoracic echo looking for right-to-left shunt is recommended.
[**2113-10-14**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY: 1.
[**2113-10-14**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: re is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, masses or mass effect.
CXR: [**2113-10-20**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided chest tube has been removed.
She had a recent admission for multiple syncopal episodes, complicated by cardiogenic/septic shock with Strep pneumo pneumonia, PE, DVT, and right-sided penumothorax.
A chest tube was placed and her lung reexpanded.
Followup CXRs showed lung reexpansion and the tube was removed on [**10-19**].
CXR on [**10-20**] prior to d/c showed an expanded right lung.
Her O2 sat increased to 88% on NRB and she was transferred to the MICU.
Her O2 sat continued to improved and she was transferred back to the floor.
INR 1.0 on discharge.
# CARDIOGENIC SHOCK - From her previous admission, likely in the setting of PEs and poor LVEF.
# CAD: NSTEMI [**2108**], STEMI [**9-/2112**] with BMS to LAD, stents patent on cath from [**2113-10-1**].
# sCHF: LVEF = 25% on TTE from [**2113-10-6**].
Repeat TTE around [**2113-10-26**]  # DEPRESSION - Stopped fluoxetine and wellbutrin to minimize polypharmacy and reduce delirium.
TRANSITIONAL --- Pulmonary Embolisms - trend INR and discontinue lovenox when therapeutic --- ICD Placement - EP will contact [**Hospital 100**] rehab to arrange transfer on Wednesday [**10-25**] for ICD.
