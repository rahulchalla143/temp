Perihilar haze is not significantly changed from previous radiographs and may represent patient's baseline.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-8-1**], there is probably no significant change.
In the ED, her BP was 86/51 and HR in the 40s so she was given glucagon (pt was on metoprolol and CCB), kayexelate 30 g, dopamine gtt, 2 liters NS, insulin and Ca gluconate in ED.
Beta blockers were held and cardiac enzymes were cycled.
Her troponins were slightly elevated with peak at 0.07, peak CK at 160.
BNP on admission was elevated at 3563.
CXR was clear without evidence of pulmonary edema and no clinical signs of CHF.
In MICU, SBP 150s and HR 60s.
A permanent pacemaker was considered, however, the patient began pacing on her own and a permanent pacemaker became unnecessary and the temporary screw lead was removed on [**11-10**].
An MRI was not performed as the patient is unable to fit in MR machine.
She was started on coumadin for atrial fibrillation and INR will be checked as an outpatient.
ARF: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with acute renal failure with a creatinine of 4.5 (baseline 1.3).
K was 6.2 on presentation and 5.5 on recheck.
Electrolytes were checked frequently while the patient was in renal failure and fluids were given.
Potassium normalized and was 3.5 on d/c.
A renal ultrasound was performed which showed no hydronephrosis.
The patient's creatinine normalized prior to discharge.
A CXR was clear.
Hypertension: Ms. [**Known lastname **] blood pressure stabilized after admission and became difficult to control.
Outpatient Lab Work INR monitoring twice a week by VNA, goal INR 2.0-3.0, results to be faxed to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] office (fax # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14632**], phone # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2394**]).
