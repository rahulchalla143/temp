PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.8, blood pressure 118/72, pulse 101, oxygen saturation 100% on 40% FIO2.
In general, this was a well-developed, well-nourished, young Caucasian female, who was lethargic and obtunded on initial presentation.
Her [**Location (un) 2611**] coma scale was noted to be 10 in the Emergency Department.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a tachycardic S1, S2, but no murmurs, gallops or rubs were appreciated.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, these were notable for a white count of 4.8, with a differential of 45 polys, 45 lymphs, 7 monos, and 1 eosinophil.
Hematocrit 39.3.
Sodium 142, potassium 4.3, chloride 106, bicarbonate 25, BUN 10, creatinine 0.8, glucose 84, thereby making an anion gap of 15.
Urinalysis was remarkable for occasional bacteria and [**3-26**] epithelial cells, no white cells, and no leukocyte esterase or nitrites.
Toxicology screen revealed an aspirin level of 28, acetaminophen level of 114, and positive benzodiazepines.
Chest x-ray on admission showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Coags were remarkable for an INR of 1.3.
Her Tylenol levels were checked daily until they returned to 0.
Her liver function tests and her coags were also checked daily until they normalized.
Given her elevated aspirin level, her urine was alkalinized with appropriate amounts of bicarbonate and her drug levels were followed very closely.
Later that night, her temperature was found to be increased to 101.7 degrees, no acute distress her white cell count increased to 14.1.
As a result, blood and urine cultures were sent off, and a repeat chest x-ray was performed.
This chest x-ray showed a new left lower lobe opacity in the retrocardiac region, consistent with a focal aspiration vs. early pneumonia that was not seen on the film taken on the day of admission.
Her cultures all remained negative, and she defervesced appropriately on the Levaquin.
Her electrolytes were checked on a daily basis, and repleted as needed.
On the day of discharge, her liver function tests were all found to be normal, and her INR had decreased to 1.2.
