Pt is minimally communicative at baseline [**2-14**] dementia, lives at a nursing home and is dependent of all ADLs (at the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6930**] nursing home vitals were 97.3 HR 79 BP 130/74 RR 20).
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, where CXR was notable for widened mediastinum on CXR.
CTA of the chest was performed to r/o aortic dissection, and was notable for a thoracoabdominal aneurysm involving the ascending, descending, thoracic and abdominal aorta.
Vascular surgey was consulted and recommended permissive hypotension with goal SBP 110s and ICU admission.
His initial vitals in the ED were T 98.2 BP 170/86 HR 60 RR 16 Sat 100%RA.
Vitals on transfer to MICU were 97.6, 79, 121/81, 19, 98%RA.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T 97.3, BP 92/70, HR 84, RR 10, Sat 100%RA.

This is aortic and better demonstrated on the chest CTA of the same date.
CT head without contrast: -------- FINDINGS:  There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or recent infarction.
Moderate, apical-predominant centrilobular emphysema and pleural parenchymal scarring are noted.
CT ANGIOGRAM:  There is a [**Doctor Last Name **] type 1 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, which measures 4.4 x 3.4 cm at the root, 3.4 x 2.9 cm in the proximal ascending aorta, 4.0 x 3.8 cm in the distal descending aorta, 3.5 x 3.3 cm proximal to the right brachiocephalic origin, 3.8 x 3 cm between the right brachiocephalic and left common carotid origins, 3.1 x 2.6 cm between the left common carotid and left subclavian origins, 4.2 x 2.7 cm distal to the left subclavian origin, 4 x 3.6 cm in the proximal descending aorta, 27 x 2.2 cm in the distal descending aorta, 4.6 x 4.3 cm at the aortic hiatus, 4.3 x 3.1 cm superior to the celiac artery takeoff, and 2.4 x 2.4 cm in the infrarenal region.
# s/p fall: Pt underwent extensive trauma workup in the ED, including CT-head, C-spine, X-ray pelvis, CXR negative for fractures.
Physical exam also did not reveal evidence of trauma.
He was monitored on telemetry closely without events.
Further cardiac/neurological workup was differed.
# Aortic Aneurysms: Because of the findings of widened mediastinum, pt underwent CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis in the ED, which revealed  [**Doctor Last Name **] type 1 thoracoabdominal aneurysm with extensive sacculation, mural thrombus, and ulcerated plaques.
His blood pressure was well controlled with SBP < 130.
Per Vascular Surgery, his systolic BP should be strictly maintained below 120.
CTA did not show dissection of the renal arteries but dilatations include renal arteries.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # CODE STATUS: full code, pending further family dicussion (to be followed) # PENDING STUDIES: none # MEDICATION CHANGES:   - INCREASE metoprolol to 50 mg tid # FOLLOWUP PLAN:   - Judicious blood pressure control with goal SBP < 120   - Per Vascular surgery, no surgical intervention recommended for aneurysm.

Acetaminophen 325 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 3.
Upon arrival, his imaging studies have shown extensive dilatations in his aorta which is the large vessel that goes out from the heart to provide blood to the body.
Blood pressure control will be very essential to reduce the chances of these dilatations to burst.
The goal for the systolic blood pressure is less than 120.
Please follow with his physician at the nursing home for blood pressure control with the goal as mentioned above.
