TEE (Complete) Done [**2126-9-11**] The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2126-9-15**] CT Head No Contrast No acute intracranial process.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
CXR [**2126-9-15**] FINDINGS: The patient is status post median sternotomy, aortic valve replacement, as well as left upper lobe resection.

His cultures here were consistently negative--blood, urine, sputum, the pacemaker leads-- but grew MSSA at the OSH.
He did have nightly fevers in the 2 weeks subsequent to his surgery despite blood cultures remaining negative and treatment with the antibiotics.
The cardiac surgeons, ID and orthopedic surgeons all discussed the possibility of incision and drainage but the fluid collection was thought to be small and not a source of infection.
The patient will need LFTs checked on Rifampin.
He will need repeat echo in 1 week.
However, he had four negative c.diff cultures so treatment was discontinued.
# Acute Kidney Injury: the patient's creatinine was 0.8 at baseline and trended up as he was initiated on gentamicin.
His gentamycin was stopped, and his lasix, losartan and spironolactone were held.
His creatinine remained stable at 2.0.
Lasix, losartan, and spironolactone should be resumed once his Cr <1.5.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Normocytic Anemia: the patient's hematocrit is in the 27-30 range.
Iron studies and hemolysis labs were obtained.
Continued on a statin, his LFTs were within normal limits.

[**Telephone/Fax (1) 96668**] # pt will need close follow up with cardiology regarding possible replacement of pacemaker, mitral valve replacement.
He will need repeat ECHO in 1 week.
# He will need weekly labs to monitor LFTs while on rifampin, along with CBC.
# His creatinine will need to be closely monitored as well.
Lasix, spironolactone, and losartan should be resumed once creatinine <1.5.
Please note the changes to your medications: - START Cefazolin 2g IV q8h for 6 weeks starting [**Date range (3) 96669**] - START Rifampin 300mg po q8h for 6 weeks starting [**Date range (3) 96669**] - STOP Atenolol - START Rosuvastatin - START Losartan - START Metoprolol - START Spironolactone - DECREASE Lasix from 40mg every morning and 20mg every evening to 20mg in the morning and the evening - INCREASE tramadol 50mg, you may take this every 4 hours as needed for pain.
