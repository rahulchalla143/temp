Head CT- mult b/l subacute/chronic infarcts.
[**9-1**] head CT ruled out acute infarct.
Repeat head CT on [**9-7**] showed no acute events.
Dilantin levels eventually became therapeutic and she began po Dilantin [**9-22**].
ENT laryngoscopy showed L sided laryngeal edema likely secondary to trauma.
coli UTI- On [**9-11**] while in the ICU she became febrile to 102.4.
CXR, blood cultures, R IJ cath tip culture, bronchoalveolar lavage, and urine cultures were sent to evaluate for infection.
Urine culture grew Ecoli sensitive to Meropenem, and blood cultures and cath tip grew MRSA.
She was treated with a full course of Meropenem and Vancomycin with repeat post-Abx cultures showing no growth.
Repeat echo showed no evidence of endocarditis.
[**9-2**] echo showed EF >75%, mild MR, and mild AS.
Fluid hydration with NS became more aggressive in the setting of sepsis.
Upon re-transfer from the ICU on [**9-21**] she was clinically hypovolemic (hypernatremia, increased bicarbonate, and decreased chloride) with decreased urine output, but CXR showed worsened pulmonary edema.
She was gently diuresed with D5W, and her fluid status was monitored.
Abdominal CT with oral contrast negative for colitis.
7) [**Name (NI) 1568**] Pt's blood glucose was monitored via fingersticks four times daily.
8) [**Name (NI) 12329**] Pt's BP was monitored throughout her admission.
Her BP was controlled with Metoprolol and Lisinopril.
Acute increases in BP were noticed during complaints of pain, and responded well to the administration of pain meds.
9) [**Name (NI) 3674**] Pts Hct on admission was stable at 26 on day of dishcharge likely a result of chronic anemia of inflammation.
Cardiac enzymes were negative X3 on admission.
