Admission Date:  [**2125-4-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-1-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Aspirin / IV Dye, Iodine Containing Contrast Media  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cerebral angiogram   History of Present Illness: 62RHM with a PMH of right parietal IPH in [**2119**] no microbleeds to suggest amyloid on recent MRI [**8-/2124**] and felt to be related to hypertension, 1x GTC seizure in [**2120**] on lamotrigine, lung cancer s/p right lobectomy 3 years ago with chemotherapy with radiation and radiation pneumonitis and periodic bronchospasm now seemingly in remission, Paroxysmal AF not on anticoagulation, CRF, HTN, COPD presented with a 2 day history of right temporal headache followed by acute onset on ED evaluation [**2125-4-29**] of left hemiparesis and difficulty speaking at 7pm with head CT at [**Hospital 27217**] Hospital showing a roughly 3.2x2.9cm right temporal IPH with minimal edema and mass effect and is being admitted to the neuro-ICU.
Patient notes being previously assessed at [**Hospital 27217**] Hospital [**4-15**] weesk ago where he apparently had a 4 day hospitalisation for headaches where CT head was normal and discharged.
She then took him to the ED to evaluate his headaches where at just after 6pm he had a CT which showed a right temporal IPH as above.
- Paroxysmal AF not on anticoagulation - CRF - OSH documentation shows previous Cr 1.8 - Seizure disorder since [**2120**] apparently 1x GTC seizure and started on lamotrigine for this - HTN - GERD - Squamous cell carcinoma - COPD and ?
Extremities: [**2-12**]+ pitting edema to upper shin on left and lower shin on right which is less significant, 2+ radial, DP pulses bilaterally.
Best gaze: 1 but mild right gaze preference 3.
Sensory: 1 9.
Language: 0 10.
Dysarthria: 1 11.
Extinction and Neglect: [**2-12**] - essentially 2 modalities (visual and sensory inattention) but not severe  -Mental Status: ORIENTATION - Alert, oriented x 3 but had to think about the month at length The pt.
was able to register 3 objects and recall 0/ 3  at 5 minutes.
There was no evidence of apraxia but had visual and sensory neglect which was not profound.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages but technically challenging and only got brife glimpses of disc.
No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally in context of significant weakness on left.

CT HEAD [**2125-4-30**] Unchanged exam with stable right temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema and minimally associated mass effect.
Further workup to exclude underlying vascular/neopalstic etiology; correlate clinically for coagulopathy/amyloid angiopathy.
MR HEAD [**2125-5-1**] Noncontrast study Right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with no significant change compared to same day CT.
CXR [**2125-4-30**] Status post right thoracic surgery, most likely lobectomy, recording rib defects and clips in situ.
However, CT should be performed given the substantially higher sensitivity of this technique.
EKG [**2125-4-30**] Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2125-4-29**] no change.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 76 176 88 364/392 58 12 55  Cerebral angiogram [**2125-5-2**]: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 23147**] underwent cerebral angiography which revealed that there were no vascular sources for his right hemispheric hemorrhages, specifically no AVM, arteriovenous fistula or vasculitis was identified.
Hip Film [**2125-5-1**] Three views show the bony structures and joint spaces to be within normal limits and symmetric with the opposite side.
If there is serious clinical concern for occult fracture, cross-sectional imaging could be considered.
MRI L Spine [**2125-5-2**]: There is normal lumbar vertebral body height and alignment.
He was transferred from an OSH with a finding of a 3.2 x 2.9 cm right temporal IPH and was admitted to the Neuro ICU for close monitoring and blood pressure control.
Repeat NCHCTs showed no change in size or extent of the hemorrhage.
Given concerns regarding the nature of his hemorrhage, he had an MRI Brain with contrast which (other than the hemorrhage) showed no underlying obvious mass or vascular malformation.
Neurosurgery was consulted to perform a diagnostic cerebral angiogram to identify a possible arteriovenous dural fistula or other cerebral vascular malformation as a possible etiology of his two hemorrhages.
This was done following the administration of steroids, H1 and H2 blockers as well as a bicarbonate preparation given his 1) chronic kidney disease with Cr 1.7-1.8, and 2) history of iodine contrast allergy.
His peripheral pulses remained constant.
We obtained hip films and a lumbar spine MRI which showed no acute injury, fracture or radicular/plexus lesion, which was reassuring.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please be sure to have Mr. [**Known lastname 23147**] follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3291**] at the dates/times listed below.

Neuro exam on discharge: Normal mental status without focal weakness or sensory deficits.
We performed a number of neuroimaging tests as well as an angiogram to understand the cause for this bleeding.
