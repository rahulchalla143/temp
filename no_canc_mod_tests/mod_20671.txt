She was taken to the operating room by gynecologic oncology and general surgery for an exploratory laparotomy on HD#23; for details, please see the dictated operative notes.
Her heart rate elevations correlated with temperature spikes.
An echocardiogram obtained on [**12-6**] was normal; a repeat obtained in the ICU after her surgery showed evidence of new RV dilatation and hypokinesis concerning for cardiomyopathy.
A follow-up echo a week later showed persistence of these findings.
Her pulmonary function worsened on HD#2 with a drop in O2 saturation to 89%, presumed to be a manifestation of developing sepsis.
CXR showed evidence of a developing PNA.
Her echocardiogram on [**12-17**] was concerning for PE and she underwent another CTA, which was negative.
Renal: The pt's creatinine was 0.6 on admission, and rose slowly over the first two weeks of her hospitalization.
Urine and serum eosinophilia were noted at the same time, and the question of AIN due to medications was raised.
Although her INR was persistently elevated, she was never clinically coagulopathic.
Prior to her exploratory laparotomy, she had a transfusion reaction to the first unit of FFP she received.
