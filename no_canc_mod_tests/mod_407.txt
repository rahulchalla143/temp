At the nursing home the temperature was 102.1 with a pulse of 126, blood in by ambulance to [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Department for evaluation with a temperature of 103.2, pulse 120, blood pressure 108/40 and respiratory rate of 30 with an oxygen saturation of 94%.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post congestive heart failure with last admission in [**2144-4-5**] for diastolic heart failure, Type 2 diabetes, dementia, benign positional vertigo, status post cholecystectomy, status post femoral neck fracture on the right with a hemiarthroplasty, chronic anemia with hematocrit of 29 and B12 deficiency.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination revealed a temperature of 103.2, pulse 120, blood pressure 108/40 and respiratory rate of 30 and oxygen saturation of 94%.
Occult blood positive brown stool per the Emergency Department.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count 17.1, hemoglobin 10.0, hematocrit 30.0, platelets 346,000.
PT was 12.2, PTT 19.1, INR 1.0.
100 white blood cells on urinalysis.
Glucose was 308, BUN 74, creatinine 2.1, sodium 148, potassium 5.8, chloride 113, bicarbonate 12, ALT 54, AST 125, CK 6,163, alkaline phosphatase 53, total bilirubin 0.5, CK MB 84.
Albumin 3.8, calcium 9.1, phosphorus 6.3, magnesium 2.7.
Cardiac troponin greater than 50.
Base x-ray on [**9-8**] revealed a right lower lobe opacity with atelectasis and probable pneumonia.
Computerized tomography scan on [**9-8**] revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen on [**9-8**] revealed a small right pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis right greater than left with dense vascular calcification.
Computerized tomography scan of the cervical spine on [**9-8**] revealed degenerative joint disease without evidence of acute fracture.
Given her high troponin levels, Cardiology was seen in consultation and they felt that it was not appropriate to cardiac catheterize the patient at that time.
Infectious Disease - The patient was seen to have probable sepsis with several possible etiologies including the possibility of ischemic bowel as indicated by the computerized tomography scan as above, infectious colitis and urosepsis.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**9-9**] for an exploratory laparotomy to rule out ischemic bowel and it was ruled out by this procedure.
To continue the workup of her diarrhea, the patient received stool cultures which were all negative and Clostridium difficile cultures which were negative times three.
The patient did receive a transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells over her stay in the hospital due to a low hematocrit and her history of coronary artery disease and recent myocardial infarction.
Computerized tomography scan in the Emergency Department was negative for any new ischemia.
The patient was followed with a repeat computerized tomography scan and was seen by the Neurology Consult Service.
No further workup ensued at this point.
The workup above was undertaken and in addition further computerized tomography scans were obtained after the patient was transferred from the Medicine Intensive Care Unit to the General Medical Floor because of ongoing diarrhea.
One of these abdominal computerized tomography scans revealed a small well circumscribed lesion in the pancreas.
An abdominal ultrasound on [**9-19**] revealed no additional changes in this lesion.
To workup this discovery a transvaginal ultrasound was undertaken which revealed a uterine stripe of 0.45 cm.
Pancreatitis 5.
Urosepsis 7.
