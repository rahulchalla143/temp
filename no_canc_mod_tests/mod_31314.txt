His symptoms progressed to weakness and dyspnea with climbing one flight of stairs.
U/A sent 6 hours after insulin gtt initiated and gap closed to 14.
Initial anion gap 16.

Imaging: CT Chest [**2110-9-11**] 7:21 AM 1.
Echo Study Date of [**2110-1-9**] EF >70%, Mild LVH .
CXR [**2111-6-15**] 9:13 AM The heart size and pulmonary vascularity are normal.
CXR [**2111-6-17**]:  New right lower lobe opacities which may represent atelectasis, infectious consolidation, or infarction.
If there is a clinical concern for pulmonary embolism, further evaluation may be performed by a chest CT angiogram.
[**2111-6-19**], Lung Scan/VQ Scan IMPRESSION:  No evidence of PE .
Blood cultures were positive [**1-22**] bottles for Group B Strep bacteremia.
His cellulitis showed slow but steady improvement.
An MRI of the foot was concerning for osseous lesion of the 5th metatarsal which was evaluated by podiatry.
Podiatry felt that a biopsy and/or I&D was warranted but after talking with ID felt that it could wait until RLE cellulitis resolved.
His anion gap corrected within the first 24 hours of hospitalization and the insulin drip was discontinued.
His anion gap was thought to be more likely from starvation ketosis than DKA.
He was given IV fluids for resuscitation and his creatinine returned to his baseline (1.7-2.2).
His MMR was stopped upon admission but was later restarted in consultation with the renal and rheumatology services.
His creatinine returned to baseline (1.8) at time of discharge.
DOE/tachycardia: Mr. [**Known lastname 25301**] complained of dyspnea on exertion, required 2 L nasal cannula to maintain his oxygen saturation and was persistently tachycardia (HR 95-100) but both the DOE and tachycardia resolved.
The patient was briefly anticoagulated but this was discontinued after LENIs were negative for DVT.
A VQ scan was performed and read as low probability for PE.
A CT angiogram was not performed to rule out DVT given the patient's chronic renal failure from kidney disease as well as the low probability result from VQ scan.
The xray showed widening of the joint space and u/s guided aspiraiton was done which showed needle shaped negatively birefringant crystals and 30K PMN consistent with gout.
