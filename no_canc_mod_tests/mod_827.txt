She was seen in [**Company 191**] on [**4-30**] and was sent to the ED for evaluation due to the concern of hypoxia to 94% and possible ischemia based on an EKG.
Vitals recorded by EMS were 146/52, 82, 18, 100%.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where initial vitals were 96.7, 73, 162/90, 20, 98% on 4L.
CXR initially thought to have LLL infiltrate and received ceftriaxone and azithromycin, but radiology later read it as normal.
EKG with new ST depressions in V4-V6, CE's negative.
ABG prior to BIPAP was 7.37/40/109.
Of note lactate 5.5 to 5.3 to 8.2 over 6 hrs, unclear etiology as no abdominal pain, hypotension, not felt to be septic physiology.

with nonallergic rhinitis, sinusitis, post-nasal drip, GERD, chronic cough and wheezing, HTN, hypercholesteremia, and CAD who presents with cough and wheezing.
Seems that most of the complaint is from hearing herself wheeze which further exacerbates the cough which then leads to SOB.
Sleep study was done, but results are still pending.
The patient is closely followed by allergy, but she would likely also benefit from further evaluation by ENT to address the issue of chronic sinusitis and post nasal drip to see if there are any other options available.
She had 3 sets of cardiac enzymes which were negative.
CXR did not show any acute process.
An ECHO was done which showed normal EF and slightly decreased pulmonary artery sytolic hypertension.
