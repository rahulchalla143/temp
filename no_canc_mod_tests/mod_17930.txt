sensitivity testing performed by Microscan.
Port a cath placement: TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: After informed consent was obtained, the patient's left upper chest was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.
The subclavian vein was entered with a microcatheter system after which a tract was made and a port reservoir created within the subcutaneous tissue.
The catheter was then measured so the eventual length would place it in the distal SVC.
Final chest x-ray demonstrates no kinks in the catheter, catheter tip in the distal SVC.
In anticipation of fixing the clogged G tube, he had a CT scan in the emergency room which showed mutiple fluid filled pockets in the abdominal wall.
Blood cultures were obtained and 2 out of 4 bottles grew gram negative rods.
He was initially treated with Zosyn, but once the culture demonstrated that it was unlikely to be pseudomonas, and the resistance pattern was consistent with an ESBL resistant Klebsiella, Pt was switched to Meropenem.
