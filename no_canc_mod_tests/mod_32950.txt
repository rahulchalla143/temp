At [**Hospital3 6592**] ([**4-9**]), the patient had Hb 16, lipase >3000, K 2.8, undetectable EtOH.
CIWA score was less than 4.
A CT of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a peri-pancreatic fluid collection, with fat stranding and a 4 cm calcified focus near the ampula of vater.
On [**4-11**], a CXR showed a LLL opacity, and the patient was started on levo/ceftriaxone.
Review of systems was otherwise negative except as specified in the HPI (patient denies recent constipation, changes in hearing, tingling/ numbness/weakness, coughing of [**Month/Day (4) **], hematuria, dysuria, [**Month/Day (4) **] in the stool, or easy bleeding).

[**2141-4-12**] CXR - IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Examination marked semi-upright has an appearance suggesting essentially supine positioning, and moderate right and moderate to large left pleural effusion, responsible for left lower lobe atelectasis.
[**2141-4-15**] CXR, PA & LAT - FINDINGS: The patient has been extubated.
Pulmonary vascular markings, cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal.
[**2141-4-15**] RUQ ultrasound - IMPRESSION: 1.
Given the heterogeneous appearance, pancreatic necrosis should be considered and full evaluation with contrast enhanced CT is advised.
# Acute pancreatitis: The patient's lipase and abominal pain initially improved, however, she continued to have mild epigastric abdominal pain and her lipase started to trend upward on hospital day 5.
Per the recommendation of the general surgery team that was following, GI was consulted for consideration of ERCP vs. further imaging given that OSH imaging showed necrosis in the pancreatic tail, a pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas (near the SMA), and a non-obstructing stone in the ampulla of vater.
The patient's abdominal pain improved and her lipase subsequently began to trend downward again.
She is scheduled to have a cholecystectomy approximately two weeks after discharge and follow-up with GI for further pancreatic imaging as well.
