Brief Hospital Course: 49 y/o M with hx of HTN, DM, ESRD on HD, HIV (CD4 560, HIV VL 116 [**8-19**]), and hx of PE on coumadin since [**2098**] presented to ED with fevers/rigors with [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] today.
Blood Cultures were drawn in the ED.
Transthoracic echocardiogram showed no signs evidence of endocarditis.
Transesophogeal Echocardiogram showed no signs of endocarditis.
Daily surveillance blood cultures were negative (after initial [**3-14**] on [**9-21**]) at time of discharge.
On transfer to the floor, blood pressure was noted to be elevated and he was started on hydralazine 10 mg PO q8h.
Blood pressures were better controlled, but decision was made to switch from hydralazine to labetalol and attempt was made to titrate this up.
Due to this, systolic blood pressure occasionally reached 200-220, and was given hydralazine IV on a prn basis.
Prior to discharge, labetalol was discontinued and Toprol XL 100mg [**Hospital1 **] was started (patient states this was his home dose).
BP was well controlled on day of discharge.
# h/o PE: Diagnosed by CT in [**2109-1-10**].
