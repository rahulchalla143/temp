In [**Month (only) **], the patient was seen at [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital for sharp chest pain, where a heart attack was ruled out but the patient did not receive a stress (according to her report).
In the Emergency Department, the patient's initial vital signs were P 0, T 98.4, HR 72, BP 155/60, RR 22, 91% on 2L.
The patient underwent chest X-rat, chest CT, and then CTA after having an elevated d-dimer.
Her first troponin was negative.
Upon leaving the ED, her vitals were T 98.4, BP 133/55, HR 66, RR 22, 97% on 4L.
A short walk caused her systolic blood pressure to read in the 190s.

Imaging: CT Chest ([**11-24**]): IMPRESSION: Acute exacerbation of a more chronic fibrotic process with a segmental distribution.
CXR ([**11-24**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CTA Chest ([**11-24**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Echo ([**11-25**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Brief Hospital Course: 70F with PMH BOOP/COP, CAD s/p stent x3, PAD who presents with dyspnea on exertion, hypoxia, chest pressure of two months duration.
Although the patient had Hx CAD, her chest pressure appeared to be mild and associated with hypoxia.
Echo was not able to measure her PA pressure.
CT chest performed [**2184-12-3**] showed substantial worsening of her ILD.
She was extubated and maintained oxygen saturation of 60-70% overnight, though was unresponsive to verbal stimuli.
On [**2184-12-5**], she was noted to be bradycardic, and her oxygen saturation dropped to 35% on the mnitor.
# Kidney injury: BUN 50, creatinine 1.4.
Blood cultures were negagive, while urine cultures showed yeast and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
