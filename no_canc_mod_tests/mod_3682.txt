HEAD CT: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR [**5-11**] IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Given underlying emphysema, three-month followup chest CT is recommended.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Calculated LVEF 57%.

Blood and urine cultures were negative.
Additionally patient continued to have continued hypoxia and ABG on [**5-12**] was 7.41/42/58/28.
LP was negative for infection, EEG was negative for seizure, MRI did not show stoke or mass, and CTA was negative for PE.
Pulmonary recommended PFTs which were scheduled but the patient was unable to perform them [**3-18**] not following comands and not able to sit up right.
Further work-up included an [**Month/Day (2) 113**] which was negative for pulmonary hypertension or shunt.
P-MIBI revealed normal myocardial perfusion and EF 57%.
Thus, her chest pain episodes were felt to be secondary to her severe anxiety and were dramatically relieved with ativan.
# Mental Status: CT of the head was negative for bleed or stroke and EEG did not show evidence of seizure.
It was thought that her hypoxia could be inducing her aggitation, but also it was possible that her aggitation was inducing her hypoxia and her oxygen need was lower when agitation was treated.
She was treated empirically also for HSV but acyclovir was d/c'd after negative LP.
She had one blood culture which grew coag neg staph felt to be contaminant.
All subsequent cultures revealed no subsequent growth to date.
C. diff was negative X 3.
