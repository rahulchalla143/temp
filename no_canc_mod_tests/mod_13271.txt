A follow-up endoscopy showed that the Plicator had probably loosened.

An upper GI study demonstrated a small distal esophageal vs GE junction leak and a chest X-ray shoed a large left pleural effusion.
A CT scan showed that the left pleural collection was loculated with air, suggesting a leak into the left chest from an esophageal perforation.
Later that day, she had an esophagoscopy, left thoracoscopy with partial decortication of lung, limited left thoracotomy with repair of diaphragmatic defect, and an exploratory laparotomy with omental flap and wide drainage.
Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl were started empirically for her pleural fluid collection.
She was tachycardic to the 130's and had a temperature of 101.1.
She had a small air leak, but a chest X-ray showed no pneumothorax.
On POD 9,6 she had an UGI demonstrated a persistent small leak just superior to the prior Nissen fundoplication, not significantly changed compared to the prior study, and the passage of contrast through GE junction was smooth.
On POD 11,8 a chest X-ray showed a continued small loculated hydropneumothorax associated with atelectasis in the left lung base.
On POD 13,10 her WBC was 14.9.
A CT scan shwed a linear small area of oral contrast extravasation just above the wrap of the Nissen fundoplication connecting to a small pocket of air just below the diaphragm, consistent with a small leak.
Later that day she had an ultrasound guided pleural fluid aspiration of 2cc of serosanguinous fluid that did not grow anything on culture.
In addition, a CT of her sinuses was normal (she has chronic sinusitis and was complaining of symptoms).
