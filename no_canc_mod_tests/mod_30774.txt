ST depression in II, aVF, V4-6  CXR ([**2176-4-22**]): There has been interval placement of endotracheal tube, which lies 4 cm above the carina.
ABD US ([**2176-4-22**]): Cholelithiasis without son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.
ECHO ([**2176-4-23**]):The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-3-8**], global biventricular systolic function is similar.
CT HEAD ([**2176-4-23**]): No intracranial hemorrhage.
CT CHEST ([**2176-4-23**]): 1.
CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS ([**2176-4-28**]): 1.
Right renal cysts   Brief Hospital Course: 1.
Bronchoscopy initially showed large clot across the carina but no active bleeding.
Repeat bronchoscopy showed slight ooze from LLL.
After INR reversal and clot removal, patient no longer had hemoptysis and hematocrit remained stable.
Sputum showed GPC on gram stain but cultures negative (taken while on levofloxacin).
CT scan of the chest showed left loculated pleural effusion that was tapped on [**4-25**] by IR showed 4+ PMNs but no organism.
Repeat CT chest subsequently showed improved L posterior pleural effusion, unchanged L loculated pleural effusion (too small to tap) and increased opacities in the RLL.
Because all her sputum, pleural fluid cultures were negative, vancomycin and aztreonam were discontinued on [**4-29**] and [**4-30**], respectively.
Unclear why INR so dramatically elevated.
Metoprolol was readded to control her rate (and titrated up).
SCr 1.0 at the time of discharge after peaking to 1.5 on admission.
Based on prior PCP notes, multiple regimens have been tried with no only moderate success.
The first two medications were not restarted before discharge, but likely could be as the patient's blood pressure was no optimized.
Hyperglycemia: Blood glucose 223 on admission finger sticks as high as 160s thereafter.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
Hemoptysis 2.
Pulmonary hypertension 3.
Congestive heart failure, diastolic 2.
