An EKG performed then revealed ST depressions.
Cardiac catheterization showed three vessel disease with completely occluded RCA and LAD and with a new thrombus in the left circumflex artery.
The patient experienced hypotension during cardiac catheterization and required an intra-aortic balloon pump placement.
He was also started on a dopamine drip for blood pressure control.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.5, blood pressure 112/71, pulse 91, respiratory rate 12, saturating 93 on 5 liters.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2, with distant heart sounds.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit 44, white count 17, platelets 363,000.
EKG on arrival was significant for sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block as well as a first-degree AV block, ST-T depressions in V1 through V6 and Q waves in V4, V5, and V6.
Cardiac catheterization had revealed ostial 20-30% in the left main, severe disease in the RCA with total occlusion, mostly chronic, LAD with total occlusion, again mostly chronic, and left circumflex with what appeared to be a large filling defect and acute thrombus which was successfully stented.
He remained very unstable on an intra-aortic pump with acute ischemia and EKG changes anytime wean was attempted.
His blood pressure improved after hospital day number three and he was able to be weaned off the dopamine.
Lopressor and occasional doses of IV Lopressor and IV Diltiazem to maintain pulse less than 100.
He was also started on an ACE inhibitor given findings of echocardiogram with poor ejection fraction between 35 and 40%.
After about a week in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient was able to be weaned off the balloon pump with better blood pressure off pressors.
However, consultation with Cardiothoracic Surgery revealed that there is lack of target vessels and that cardiac surgery would not be an option for this patient.
We, therefore, decided to obtain a Persantine MIBI test which showed a fixed large inferior defect as well as a partially reversible lateral wall defect.
These findings showed that the most appropriate approach at this point would be to maximize medical management.
Another cardiac catheterization with high-risk intervention upon his RCA and LAD which are chronically occluded was deemed unnecessary at this point.
Multiple blood cultures showed no clear identifiable source, although he did have a blood culture positive for group B Streptococcus as well as a poor sputum sample positive for gram-positive cocci.
