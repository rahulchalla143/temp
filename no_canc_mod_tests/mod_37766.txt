His postoperative course was notable for hepatorenal syndrome requiring hemodialysis with extubation on postoperative day #5, and echocardiogram which demonstrated a decreased ejection fraction at 35%, with 2+ mitral regurgitation on approximately postoperative day #5.
Hepatitis C. 2.
PHYSICAL EXAM - VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.6, heart rate 99, blood pressure 165/96, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 89% on 100% nonrebreather.
PERTINENT LABORATORY STUDIES:  WBC 8.8, hematocrit 34.6, platelet count 250, sodium 131, potassium 5.3, creatinine 3.2, AST 43, ALT 47, INR 1.1, alkaline phosphatase 332, total bilirubin 5.5, amylase 57, lipase 13, albumin 3.2.
IMAGING:  A chest x-ray done at the time of admission demonstrated bilateral infiltrates with markings consistent with CHF.
An echocardiogram was done which demonstrated, again, an ejection fraction of 35% without changes from prior study.
The patient's total bilirubin had been elevated throughout his stay, and a liver ultrasound with biopsy was performed on hospital day #7.
This study demonstrated questionable stenosis of the right hepatic artery and was negative for ejection.
He was also instructed to have his labs drawn twice weekly for CBC, chem-10, LFTs, and cyclosporin levels.
