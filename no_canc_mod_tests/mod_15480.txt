She ahd an ultrasound, which confirmed small stones and sludge, but a small gallbladder.
Subsequently, the laboratory came back revealing that her liver enzymes were all normal preop, but nonetheless, the common bile duct size was clearly abnormal and therefore the cholangiograms were necessary.
Intra-operative cultures from the gall bladder later grew pansensitive E. Coli and she remained on Levoquin.
An Echo was obtained on [**2103-12-11**] showing Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Her creatinine returned to baseline by the end of her hospital stay.
