Radiology: XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2124-12-20**] 6:03 PM Preliminary Report !!
In the ED her vitals were stable and ECG showed a mild QTc elevation at 469 for which she was treated with IV magnesium sulfate.
Toxicology consulted and recommended ICU admission for close monitoring for signs of 1) Citalopram toxicity including serotonin syndrome, seizures 2) quetiapine toxicity include lethargy and sedation, miosis, tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension and other anti-cholinergic symptoms.
Patient displayed no evidence of serotonin syndrome or anticholinergic toxidrome on physical exam but did exhibit dilated pupils, horizontal nystagmus and mild myoclonus initially all of which completely resolved by [**12-21**].
She will need an ECG rechecked in the community.
Citalopram, quetiapine, lorazepam and venlafaxine held in the setting of her overdose.
She was monitored on telemetry without event.
Iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate within normal limits.
CBC will need to be followed as an outpatient.
