Since the previous tracing of [**2182-12-30**] further ST-T wave changes are present and the QTc interval appears longer.
Echocardiogram [**2190-9-25**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2183-2-17**], left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate aortic stenosis, and moderate aortic regurgitation are new.
ECG [**2190-9-25**] Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2190-9-25**]  12:25:18 PM   Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-9-19**] the ST-T wave changes and prolonged Q-T interval are new.
ECG [**2190-9-25**] Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2190-9-25**]  3:38:54 PM   Sinus tachycardia.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2190-9-28**]  2:34:52 PM   Sinus rhythm with slowing of the rate as compared with previous tracing of [**2190-9-25**].
There is Q-T interval prolongation and deep T wave inversion which is global and consistent with extensive anterolateral and apical ischemia and/or myocardial infarction and likely further evolution as compared with previous tracing of [**2190-9-25**].
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-9-25**], the function of the distal segments has improved slightly.
Pulmonary pressures are similar on both studies (under-reported on prior).

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Due to the limited views of this current study, further evaluation is recommended by CT.  MRI OF THE PELVIS: The urinary bladder is unremarkable.
Evaluation of the bowel loops in the pelvis is hindered by the limited views.
Further evaluation is recommended by CTE due to the patient's claustrophobia.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

UGI Endoscopy [**2190-9-21**] Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Had an episode of expressive apahsia (subjective and noted by daughter) which resolved after 2 hours and may have represented a small stroke - no imaging was performed.
Now very deep TwI on ECG - likely progression of changes as TnT continued to fall.
[**Month/Day/Year **] - improving stress cardiomyopathy with stable valve disease on repeat [**Month/Day/Year 113**].
BLOODY DIARRHEA: In the ED, she was hemodynamically stable, but her Hct was low at 17.
NG lavage was unremarkable, and CXR was negative for free air.
She was given Vitamin K 10 mg IV (for INR 2.4), Pantoprazole 80 mg IV then ggt, 2 units FFP and 1 unit PRBC.
Her Hct had elevated to 27, appropriate given the transfusion, and she was complaining of only mild abdominal cramping that had significantly improved.
Her Hct was closely monitored.
Colonoscopy revealed multiple non-bleeding diverticula in the whole colon and grade 1 internal hemorrhoids; EGD was unremarkable.
Capsule endoscopy was performed per GI recommendations, and revealed an intraluminal mass with a smooth pink surface in the small bowel, without bleeding at the site.
For further work-up and follow-up on capsule study, she underwent MR enterography which was not completed due to an episode of flash pulmonary edema.
Gi were unkeen to do other investigations of her bleeding unless this recurred at which point a tagged RBC scan and/or CT-enterography could be done.
However, it then stabilized at 28-32, but after several episodes of passing clots and BRBPR, Hct dropped again to 23.7.
She received 2 additional units of PRBCs, and Hct bumped up to 33.8.
HTN: Her BP on presentation was 138/30 (baseline unknown).
As there was no active bleeding and Hct was stable, we placed her back on amlodipine 5 mg daily, but continued holding the rest of the regimen.
Upon trasnfer, pt started on bipap 8/5 and lasix drip with rapid improvement in symptoms and was weaned to 2L NC with RR 18-20.
ESM was noted on exam and AS/AR/MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 113**].
TnT was max 0.14 which could represent small NSTEMI but baseline is also high given CRF.
Pulmonary pressures were similar on both studies (under-reported on prior) and degree of mitral regurgitation was probably similar.

Your fluid balance and breathing improved and you were seen by physical therapy who felt you needed further ongoing rehab in a facility.
While in the hospital, you underwent a colonoscopy and upper GI endoscopy (too look for possible bleeding points within the upper bowel and stomach) to look at your bowel.
Given your recent acute illness and fragile state and the fact that your blood counts remained stable for several days without any further blood products, further work up for this abnormality was not done while you were in the hospital.
You had a echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) which revealed changes to your heart related to stress.
