At [**Hospital3 **] he did rule in for an myocardial infarction with a troponin of 2.3 and he was started on a heparin protocol with Integrilin and given sublingual nitroglycerin.
On admission to the hospital he did have a slight dorp in his blood pressure to a systolic of 60 and was given fluid boluses.
Following his catheterization Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] was consulted for coronary artery bypass graft procedure.
On the first postoperative morning it was noted that he did have a white blood cell count of 21,000.
His examination was normal and it was felt that he was stable and ready to be transferred to the Surgical Floor.
Once the heparin drip had been discontinued his PTT and INR did decrease to within normal limits with doses of vitamin K.  The patient continued to progress until postoperative day number three when in the early morning hours he was noted to have a temperature spike to 102.9.
When the patient was examined he was noted to have an acute abdomen and cultures were sent.
As the morning progressed the patient became hypotensive and a white blood cell count was noted to be elevated to 23,000.
The patient's hematocrit at the time was also noted to be 23% and he was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
He did obtain an abdominal CT scan, which showed appendicitis and later that day was taken to the Operating Room for an open appendectomy.
Cultures were obtained and the patient s transferred back to the CSRU with an open wound and he was stable and intubated and sedated .
It was noted again on [**8-20**] that his coagulation studies were elevated despite not receiving any type of anticoagulation treatment and it was felt again that this was secondary to diminished vitamin K level and poor nutrition.
Therefore he was given vitamin K supplements and eventually his coagulation studies returned to [**Location 213**].
The patient continued to exhibit an elevated white blood cell count anywhere from 18,000 to 22,000.
On the 29th he started to exhibit improving white blood cell count with a decrease to [**Numeric Identifier 6085**].
There was some concern, because his white blood cell count had increased again and he did receive a follow up abdominal CT scan, which showed no signs of abscess and normal post surgical changes.
By [**8-31**] his white blood cell count had decreased to 12,000 and the main concern at this point was his wound healing and nutrition status.
With the increase in his nutrition status his blood sugars were noted to be elevated and therefore his Glyburide was increased to 10 mg po a day.
On the day of discharge his examination shows his lungs to be clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His discharge laboratories show a white blood cell count of 11.6, hematocrit 31.8, platelets [**Numeric Identifier 33509**], sodium 135, potassium 4.1, chloride 102, CO2 26, BUN 27, creatinine 1.0, glucose 172.
His chest x-ray on discharge shows very small bilateral effusions with the left greater then right.
His electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm at 72.
Regular insulin sliding scale when the finger stick blood sugars are between 150 to 200 the patient should receive 4 units of subq insulin, finger stick blood sugars 201 to 250 6 units of subq insulin, finger stick blood sugars 251 to 300 8 units of subq insulin, finger stick blood sugars 301 to 350 10 units of subq insulin, finger stick blood sugars 351 to 400 16 units of subq insulin and greater then 401 20 units of subq insulin and call the house officer.
This should be done by injecting the sponge with a mixture of 1 cc of 1% Xylocaine and 10 cc of normal saline and injecting that into the sponge prior to reapplying the vacuum.
