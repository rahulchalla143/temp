CT of abdomen and pelvis showed no free fluid, no free air.
CT of the chest showed left pulmonary contusion, vascular negative.
The patient obtained flexion extension views to clear his C-spine which was done.
Essentially his coumadinization was reversed using FFP and vitamin K.  Upon discharge his INR was approximately 1.3.
The patient's hematocrit gradually trended down into the high 20s.
The patient was transfused to obtain hematocrit greater than 30.
As his hematocrit continued to trend down, chest x-ray was reobtained and it showed a large left effusion consistent with hemothorax.
The chest tube expressed 800 cc of blood initially.
Sequential chest x-rays showed resolution of the hemothorax.
While in the ICU the patient also received an MRI of the C-spine showing no acute cord changes and reiterated the severe cervical spinal stenosis.
The patient had also received an additional abdominal CT while on the unit as his hematocrit had been falling, as previously stated.
