No obvious cardiac injury; however, the evaluation for such is limited on CT. 3.
Further evaluation after emergent conditon is addressed should be pursued with referral to pancreas center and likely abdominal MRI (without contraindication).
[**2161-10-15**] CAT Head and neck : 1.
[**2161-10-16**] MRI Head : Right greater than left acute cortical infarcts, mostly in a watershed distribution.
[**2161-10-17**] Cardiac echo : The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-10-9**], the detected pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is higher.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Trauma team on the Emergency Room and admitted to the Trauma ICU for further management of his hemothorax and for evaluation by the Stroke team in light of his new symptoms and CT findings.
His hemodynamics were stable despite a hematocrit of 20 and he was transfused with a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells.
From a neurologic standpoint the Stroke team felt his strokes were from a cardioembolic origin.
He underwent serial neuro checks and displayed some periods of confusion, garbled speech and had mild left sided weakness.
His hematocrit remained stable after his [**Female First Name (un) 899**] was coiled as were his hemodynamics.
Of note his admission Abd Ct scan showed some changes in the prostate possibly related to cancer.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was  discharged on [**2161-10-26**] to his daughters home and will follow up within the week for an INR and next week for follow up appointments.
Right hemothorax 5.
