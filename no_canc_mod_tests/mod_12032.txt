Mean airway pressure 14.
Maximum support, peak inspiratory pressure 24, PEEP 6, rate 28, required high frequency oscillating ventilation on day 18 with maximum support, mean airway pressure 14, amplitude 26, weaned to conventional ventilation on day of life 30 and extubated on day 31 to CPAP, failing nasal cannula trials on days 56, 73, and 86.
Maximum CPAP support pressure +7, current support +5, FIO2, 32% to 40% with respiratory rate in the 50s.
ABG obtained on nasal cannula pH 7.36, pCO2 84, pO2 51, CO2 51, base excess 17.
Pulmonary consult obtained, recommendation of trial of Diamox in hopes of increasing respiratory drive with resultant CO2 removal, follow up ABG pH 7.29, pCO2 82, pO2 104, CO2 41, base excess 9.
Follow up ABG on CPAP, pH 7.35, pCO2 73, pO2 72, CO2 42, base excess 10.
Echocardiogram confirmed closure on [**2104-12-8**].
The infant has a PPS murmur, blood pressure stable since day of life 3, with most recent [**Location (un) 1131**] 66/34, mean 38.
Heart rate 150s to 160s at the time of dictation.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The infant was initially NPO and maintained on IV fluids via umbilical arterial catheter, umbilical venous catheter, and PICC lines.
Weight at the time of discharge: 3.910 kilograms.
NUTRITION LABS:  Last nutrition labs drawn on [**2-5**], [**2105**], results as follows: phosphatase 6.0, alkaline phosphatase 519, calcium 9.6, albumin 3.2.
Most recent electrolytes were drawn on [**2105-3-8**], results as follows: Sodium 142, Potassium 4.5, Chloride 99, total CO2 36.
Peak total bilirubin of 4.3, direct 0.2.
Hyperbilirubinemia resolved on day 7 and rebounded on day 10, with a peak total bilirubin of 4.8, direct 0.4.
Resolved to a total bilirubin of 1.9, direct 0.4 on day 12.
HEMATOLOGIC:  Hematocrit at birth equals 48.9%.
Most recent hematocrit 31 with reticulocyte count of 5%.
A complete blood count showed a white count of 10.2 with a differential of 30% polys, 0% bands.
Blood culture was sent and antibiotics were started for a seven-day course.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Head ultrasound on day 2 showed bilateral ventricles "generous in size, left greater than right" without intraventricular hemorrhage.
Followup head ultrasound on [**11-24**], indicated mild dilation of the ventricles with left greater than right and no blood.
Followup head ultrasound on [**12-2**] showed continued asymmetry with left greater than right, both sides enlarged from previous head ultrasound, no blood.
Neurologic exam is consistent with gestational age.
Follow-up examination is recommended in eight months.
PSYCHOSOCIAL:  [**Hospital1 69**] social worker involved with family.
All tests sent and are pending at current time.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECEIVED:  DaPT on [**1-15**]; IPV [**1-16**];  hemophilus B, [**1-16**]; HBV [**1-16**]; PCV 7, [**1-15**].
Prematurity 26 weeks by examination now 43 weeks.
