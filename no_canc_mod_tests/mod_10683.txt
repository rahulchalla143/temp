On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were T96.0, HR120, BP123/67, RR18, O2 sat 100% (Ambu Bag).
Subsequent ABG was 7.22/43/513/19 with lactate improved slightly to 4.8.
CT head and CXR within normal limits (no signs of aspiration).
Labs were otherwise remarkable for creatinine 1.6, mildly positive UA (trace leuks, 2 WBC, few bacteria, <1 epi).
After successful heimlich in the field, she was maintaining sats of 90%, was bagged, brought to ED, intubated for airway protection, and found to be in metabolic acidosis 7.26/36/175/17 with a lactate 5.7.
Present CXR and CT-Head were WNL.

CT head - No acute intracranial pathological process.
CXR [**2193-6-11**]: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright  position.
When comparison is made with previous chest examinations dated [**2190**], the heart size has moderately increased and the pulmonary vasculature and the pleural effusions suggest a mild degree of chronic CHF.

Although foreign body aspiration events are not uncommon in the elderly population, patient's course has been complicated by loss of consciousness and inability to follow commands.
# Pre-Renal [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr elevated to 1.4 the day of discharge from 1.1; received 1L of NS prior to discharge and repeat Cr was stable at 1.4.
CXR and history pointed to aspiration pneumonitis; PNA was considered but thought unlikely in the absence of clinical sequallae.
Follow-up CXR showed small pleural effusions, no infiltrate.
# Complicated UTI: UA from foley was positive; culture was positive for E.Coli > 100k.
Baseline Hct 32-34 and patient currently is close to this.
# Elevated eosinophils: Last CBCd showed elevated eosinophils; this should be rechecked on follow-up with primary care physician.
