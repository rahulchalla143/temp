She had a complication of an anastomotic leak and was reoperated on for a large pelvic abscess.
She underwent a preoperative CT scan with oral contrast which demonstrated no passage of contrast through the fistula, and no clear fistula at the pelvic anastomosis.

Post-operative pain was a major issue initially and in consultation with APS her PCA dose was increased to 0.5mg and her fentanyl (pre-operative) was re-started with good effect.
Her nasogastric tube was kept to wall suction and the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain placed in the operating room was kept to bulb suction.
Her blood pressure and urine output were marginally low overnight POD1 and she recieved several fluid boluses.
Her POD2 hematocrit returned at 25.0 (from 33), and given her anemia in the face of hypovolemia the decision was made to transfuse one unit of blood.
Plain films revealed substantial atelectasis, with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes.
Urine and blood cultures were sent which were all negative and the patient's EKG was normal.
The last bag of total parenteral nutrition finished on [**1-29**] and her calorie counts were sufficient at this point with oral intake alone.
Her wound staples have been removed and replaced with white steri-strips that will fall off on their own.
VNA services have been arranged for help with both the ostomy, and wet to dry dressing changes, and the patient has follow-up scheduled with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] as outlined below.
