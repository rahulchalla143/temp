Pt was complaining of diffuse back tenderness so a CT scan was obtained of her c,t and l-spine.
The CT of the cervical spine was concerning for a ligamentous tear so neurosurgery was consulted who recommended a cervical MRI.
ABG was 7.06/115/91.
Osteoporosis 3.
Colon CA s/p colectomy '[**38**] 6. s/p CCY 7.
Family History: Non contributory  Physical Exam: T: 98.9 BP: 101/39 P: 89 AC 500x16, 0.5, peep 5, 100% GEN: intubated, sedated, elderly female, intermittently agitated and moving all extremities but not following commands HEENT: anicteric sclera, pupils 4->3 mm bilaterally NECK: cervical collar in place RESP: CTA anteriorly, no w/r/c CV: RRR, I/VI SEM at apex ABD: soft, nt/nd, +bs EXT: R hip wound c/d/i, no ecchymosis or tenderness, 2+ dp/pt pulses bilaterally SKIN: warm/dry   Pertinent Results: CT of c-spine [**12-18**]: 1.
Exaggerated cervical lordosis with widening of C4/C5 and C5/C5 with slight retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 which may reflect injury to the anterior longitudinal ligament, and therefore, further evaluation with MRI is recommended if clinically warranted.
Linearly lucency in the anterior-superior endplate of T2, not seen on prior CT C-spine on [**2151-5-27**], which may represent an acute or subacute fracture as noted above.
CT of t-spine [**12-18**]: Compression deformity of the T6, T11, T12, and L1 vertebrae which appears stable when compared to chest radiograph obtained on [**2151-7-13**], and L-spine obtained on [**2151-5-27**].
CT of l-spine [**12-18**]: 1.
Stable appearance of T12 and L1 compression fracture compared to L-spine radiograph obtained on [**2151-5-27**].
CT head [**12-18**]: No intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR [**12-18**]: The heart size is top normal.
CXR [**12-19**]: Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube with its tip at the level of the clavicular heads.

Chronic compression of T2 vertebra.
[**2151-12-21**] CXR Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates no significant interval change from the study earlier today.
Respiratory failure Pt's initial ABG with respiratory acidosis, likely due to sedation causing CO2 retention, which is similar to what happened in ED, and responded to narcan.
CXR did not show any acute reason for this change.
Less likely possibility is intracranial event; head CT was negative.
She continued to have an oxygen requirement, and CXR showed a possible retrocardiac opacity.
Given this, she was started on levofloxacin and flagyl, and blood cultures/urinalysis were checked which were negative.
Her oxygen requirement did not change.
Her oxygen requirement did not increase.
EKG without signs of ischemia, CE negative x 2.
CT head negative.
cervical injury Neurosurg was consulted regarding widening of C4/C5 with slight retrolithesis of C4 on C5 and linear lucency of T2 and rec cervical MRI to eval for ligamentous injury.
Cervical MRI was without new injury or tear, and collar was removed.
Hct drop Unclear etiology, wound looks good without evidence of hematoma, no melena/BRBPR.
She received a total of 2 U PRBC and hematocrit remained stable.
Blood loss was likely post-operative.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Her stool was guaiac positive but her HCT was stable and she remained hemodynamically stable.
She will need an outpatient colonoscopy.
Her HCT will be monitored at [**Hospital3 537**].
Your blood count was low and you were given some blood.
Your blood count remained stable but your stools were positive for blood so the cause will need to be evaluated.
