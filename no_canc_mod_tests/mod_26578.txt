CXR showed only atelectasis.
We also considered cardiac ischemia given his history of CAD, but he had no chest pain or ischemic EKG changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.
Given his prolonged course of high-dose steroids, he was started on Bactrim, pantoprazole, calcium and vitamin D.  He will stop the Bactrim and pantoprazole after stopping prednisone, but continue Ca + Vit D.  The patient is often irritable and unstable while on steroids, and at one point threw a commode towards a health care worker.
His tox screen was negative.
Renal ultrasound negative for obstruction.
On admission, the chest pain he described sounded more pleuritic, atypical.
EKG was w/o ischemic changes; CE neg x 2.
EKG was again unchanged and his pain improved with Maalox.
