After three days of antibiotics (Clinda and Unasyn) and an interval CT scan showing no improvement, the decision was made to I&D the swelling.
After initial improvement, the swelling increased POD#2 and a repeat scan showed increased edema and airway deviation.
Fiberoptic examination showed some supgraglottic edema, and the patient was having increased difficulty handling her secretions, so we decided to transfer her to an ICU.
Infectious disease was consulted and recommended switching the Clindamycin with Vancomycin and Meropenim and a series of labs and cultures.
On [**10-4**] her blood was sent for EBV, HIV, [**Doctor First Name **], CMV, and RPR.
EBV was isolated from her blood culture.
