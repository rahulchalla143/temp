Echocardiogram ([**2110-6-5**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CXR ([**2110-6-4**]): Large opacity projecting over the right hemithorax, may represent combination of consolidation, atelectasis, and possible underlying pleural effusion, worrisome for infection, however, underlying malignancy is not excluded, and followup to resolution is recommended.
CXR ([**2110-6-4**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing atelectasis at the left lung base.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2109-4-13**] left bundle-branch block and left atrial enlargement are seen on the current tracing.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**2110-6-11**]): 1.
The LM, LAD, LCx and RCA were free of angiographically apparent disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 7mmHg.
TTE ([**2110-6-12**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-6-5**], estimated pulmonary artery pressures are slightly higher.

TTE revealed biventricular dilatation and severe hypokinesis with an EF of 15-20%, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate to severe pulmonary artery hypertension and  biatrial dilatation.
Serial EKGs revealed intermitent atrial tachycardia (vs. sinus rhythm with APCs) with an incomplete LBBB.
To investigate the etiology of his CHF, the ICU team checked HIV, which was negative, and iron studies, which were inconsistent with iron overload.
TSH was low but free T4 was within normal limits.
The patient was then transferred to the cardiology service for further management and evaluation for CAD.
Patient was then taken for cardiac catheterization which revealed a right dominant system without angiographically apparent disease of the LM, LAD, LCx and RCA.
Follow-up of CBC with consideration of outpatient hematology-oncology referral 5.
Urine lytes were consistent with a prerenal etiology.
His serum sodium stabilized in the low 130s for several days and was 132 at discharge.
Lyme serologies checked by the ICU team were negative.
Respiratory viral antigen screen and culture were negative.
EKG was consistent with an SVT.
He received 48 hours of Diamox when his serum bicarbonate reached 40.
His bicarbonate downtrended and was 33 at discharge.
