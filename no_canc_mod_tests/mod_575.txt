Notable findings at the OSH include ampicillin sensitive enterococcal bacteremia, CT scan findings of possible aortitis and a right pleural effusion.
Past Medical History: 1.CAD, NSTEMI [**5-22**] refused Cath -complicated by cardiomyopathy, with EF =45% -negative stress test [**11/2137**] - ECHO in [**5-/2138**] with reported paradoxical motion of LV apex, hypokinesis of septum and anterior wall infarct ischemia.

Examination is limited and for better evaluation if clinically indicated, a repeat study with proper sedation is recommended.
MRI C/T/L spine [**2138-7-27**]: Discitis and osteomyelitis at C5-C6 level.
TTE [**7-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall, moderate hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall, and extensive apical akinesis.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
However CXR more consistent with worsening CHF and pleural effusion.
CXR revealed moderate R pleural effusion as well as worsening CHF.
On [**8-9**] extubated, R Thoracentesis removed 2L fluid.
CXR improved following but clinical scenario without change.
Also considered component of hypovolemic shock given depleted intravascular status w/ hypoalbuminemia, pt transfused to HCT 30 ([**2061-8-12**]) w/o improvement in pressor requirement (continued levophed requirement).
The pt had 2L dialyzed off on [**8-24**] and pt with hypotension w/ sbp 70 overnight responsive to 750 cc bolus.
Zyprexa started [**8-21**], Started SSRI, celexa [**8-25**], using standing valium to wean from midazolam drip s/p trach.
After psych evaluation began Haldol 5mg IV BID, then held Celexa in setting of poor renal function.
[**8-18**] and [**8-25**] sputum remains + for gram - rods.
Continue cefepime (had started cefepime and vanco [**8-13**], changed temporarily to ceftriaxone for better gram - coverage prior to sensitivites, reverted back to cefepime [**8-18**])through [**9-2**] for 15d course .
total protein 3207g=nephrotic syndrome.
renal plan for renal biopsy when/if pt stable to determine if any aspect of nephrotic dz would be steroid responsive.
[**7-27**]: MRI total spine [**7-27**]: retropharyngeal fluid collection at level of C1-C5; may be pre-vertebral as opposed to retropharyngeal,adjacent to C5-6 vertebrae w/ appearance c/w osteomyleitis.
Ortho spine evaluated and no concern for fluid collection itself compromising vital structures; therefore no need surgical intervention.
Recently on amp alone as all blood cx here (from [**7-25**] onward) have been negative, possible sources (TV veg on TTE, osteo, cervical fluid collection).
blood cx negative at [**Hospital1 18**] since [**7-25**].
Final radiology CT read: chronic/dormant aortitis.
Cardiac enzymes were sent but ?relevance of results given pt on CVVH.
Hx=NSTEMI [**5-22**], pt refused cath.
