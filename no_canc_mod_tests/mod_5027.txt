This morning, his hypoxia progressed to the point that he needed high flow face mask to maintain sats of 96%.
Since his chest x ray was unchanged, it was hypothesized that his new A-a gradient was due to a pulmonary embolism.
A CTA cannot be obtained because of the patient's renal failure and a V/Q scan would not be useful since his baseline CXR shows infiltrates.

CT pelvis [**11-13**]: 7 x 4 cm right iliacus hematoma likely secondary to small nondisplaced right iliac bone fracture.
CXR [**11-21**]: A new consolidation is seen in the right lower lung having relatively sharp contours with elevation of right hemidiaphragm and downward displacement of the right hila, most likely representing new atelectasis.
ECHO [**11-14**]: EF 70-75%.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Culture data was pending at the time of discharge.
