She was found to have inferior Q waves on EKG with trop of 14 and CK 948.
Her vitals on transfer were temp 97.7, hr 96 sinus, bp 143/83, rr 16 sating 97% on RA.
On the floor, she had two further episods of hypotension with blood pressure going to 54/37.
HRs were 105-119.
A STAT Echo was performed which showed normal RV and LV function.
A non-contrast CT showed right RP bleed.

CARDIAC CATH: PTCA COMMENTS: Initial angiography revealed subtotal occlusion of OM1 distally.
A 6F XB LAD 3.5 guiding catheter provided adequate support for the procedure.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI III flow.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
TTE [**3-14**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
TTE [**3-15**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-3-14**], no major change.
CXR [**3-15**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: There is a severe distortion of pulmonary architecture with marked scarring upper lobe retraction large cystic cicatrices throughout the lungs and right perihilar opacification.
A scan of the abdomen showing the lower chest, on [**3-14**] showed no right pleural effusion so the right pleural abnormality is thickening not fluid, but also showed an 8-mm partially ground-glass nodule in the right lower lobe (2:3) and a moderate hiatus hernia.
# HYPOTENSION:  Patient had an RP bleed on CT likely related to intervention.
Patient was transfused 2u pRBC, and her hct stabilized.
TTE showed normal cardiac function.
Because of your heart attack you had a cardiac catheterization, which opened up the vessel in your heart that was blocked off.
