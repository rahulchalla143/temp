HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old woman with known coronary artery disease status post Persantin MIBI on [**2190-2-5**] showing a moderate reversible inferior defect at which time she had refused cardiac catheterization.
She was brought to the Emergency Department by ambulance where on arrival she had 2/10 chest pain with EKG showing biphasic T waves in III and aVF, 0.5 to [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in II and III, 0.5 mm depressions in I and aVL.
Labs are notable on admission for a CK of 267, troponin of 12 with a MB fraction of 47, index of 17.6.
She was initially hypertensive to a systolic blood pressure of 170 in the Emergency Department.
She was started on a heparin drip and IV Nitroglycerin with relief of her chest pain.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 50%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the CCU, patient was afebrile with a temperature of 98.5 F, blood pressure 113/37, heart rate 76, respiratory rate 18, pulse oximetry 97% on two liters.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  CBC revealed a white count of 7.4, hematocrit 35.8, platelets of 177.
Chem-7 was unremarkable except for BUN and creatinine of 44 and 1.2 respectively.
At the time of admission to the CCU, a second set of cardiac enzymes had been obtained which showed a CK of 356, MB of 65, troponin at that time was 43.
EKG on admission to the CCU revealed sinus rhythm at 73 beats per minute, normal axis, QTC of 453, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in II, III and aVF, Q waves were now present in II, III and aVF as well with T wave inversions in I and aVL.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2190-12-6**].
Hemodynamics from cardiac catheterization revealed a cardiac output of 5.32 and a cardiac index of 3.04 by the Fick method.
Wedge pressure was 8.
PA pressure 32/13 with a mean of 22.
Left heart cath revealed mild LV diastolic dysfunction with mild to moderate aortic stenosis.
LV gram showed ejection fraction of approximately 60%.
Angiography revealed right dominant system with 50 to 60% left main coronary artery lesion.
An echocardiogram was done to evaluate her LV function which revealed a mildly enlarged left atrium, mild LVH with impaired relaxation.
Ejection fraction of 30% down from 50% in [**2190-1-12**], moderate to severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior and lateral walls and apex.
She had trace AI and 1 to 2+ MR.  She had moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension without pericardial effusion.
basis with Lasix for pulmonary edema with improvement of her creatinine from 1.8 down to 1.4 prior to discharge.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1169**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11422**] to assist her in making the decision of having this surgery in the future.
HEMATOLOGY:  On the day of discharge without any obvious source of bleeding, the patient was found to have a hematocrit of 26.7.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30%.
