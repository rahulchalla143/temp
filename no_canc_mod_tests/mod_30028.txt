Lumbar Puncture 2.
Patient is a 58 y/o male with a history of HIV (CD4 36, VL 14,700 on [**7-9**]), T2DM, and HTN s/p recent admission with brain lesions who presented with confusion and fevers.
Brain biopsy was non-diagnostic and he had a post-op sub-arachnoid hemorrhage that was stable on serial CT scans.
He had a Head CT that showed a new large region of hypodensity of the left frontal white matter adjacent to the previously identified subcentimeter lesion near the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Lumbar puncture was eventually done (see below for results).
Patient treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and acyclovir empirically while the cultures were pending, but those were stopped.
MRI was also done while in the MICU showing multiple new enhancing lesions and T2 abnormalities are seen in both cerebral hemispheres as well as the right inferior cerebellum.
On transfer from the MICU to the floor, patient was in sinus tacc with SBP 140s and afebrile.
Past Medical History: -HIV diagnosed [**3-14**]: CD4 count 17 in [**5-15**], VL<50; started on HAART earlier this year, with reduction in VL -History of PCP PNA [**Name9 (PRE) 93328**]/HAV -History of knife wound in Montserrat in [**2135**].

Pertinent Results: [**2155-7-31**]: CT Head w/out Contrast: IMPRESSION:   1.
Further evaluation with gadolinium enhanced MR is suggested.
MRI/MRA [**2155-8-1**]: MRI IMPRESSION:  Multiple new enhancing lesions and T2 abnormalities are seen in both cerebral hemispheres as well as the right inferior cerebellum.
MRA OF THE HEAD:  The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
[**2155-8-5**]: CT Head W/out Contrast IMPRESSION:  1.
Differential considerations include evolving infectious process such as toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, or cryptococcus.

Laboratory Results: [**2155-8-22**] 04:31a Source: Line-PICC Sodium 133 Chloride 103 BUN  18 Glucose 83   AGap=13 Potassium 4.3 HCO3 21 Crt 1.8 Ca: 9.9 Mg: 1.9 P: 3.2  Source: Line-PICC  WBC 4.1  Hemoglobin 8.5 Platelets 131 HCT  24.5   Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 58 year old man with HIV/AIDs (CD4 count 34) who presented to the emergency room with fevers and change in mental status, with imaging and microbiology results most consistent with cerebral toxoplasmosis.
During the hospital stay the lumbar puncture was performed (6WBC (1% Polys, 78%Lymphocytes, 21% Monocytes; 0Atypicals) 0 RBC; Elevated Protien: 135;  glucose 79;  Opening Pressure: 33cm H20).
CSF fluid was negative for [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] Virus (by PCR), HSV 1&2 (PCR), Syphillis VDRL, CMV  and Toxoplasmosis IgG/IgM.
He was started on intravenous Bactrim in the MICU but was switched to oral Pyrimethamine/Sulfadiazine once nasogastric tube was placed due to concern over rising creatinine and worsening renal function.
A repeat image of his brain after completing treatment for toxoplasmosis will be helpful to futher evaluate this, and has been scheduled for [**2155-9-1**] at [**Hospital1 18**] in the Clinical Center of the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] at 7am in the basement.
The imaging showed new lesions, however it was felt that this was not yet a failure of treatment for his toxoplasmosis, given he had not consistently been getting medications.
Cryptococcus Antigen was detected in the blood stream, but not in the CSF.
His liver enzymes were also initially elevated, likely in part to the hepaitis B, but they trended down to the normal range.
HIV/AIDS (CD4: 36, VL 14,700 in [**2155-7-9**]) During the hospital stay, patient was on Truvada/Kaletra.
* His creatinine should be monitored closely, every one to two days, now that his HAART medications have been restarted.
Cr on discharge was 1.8.
* His creatinine should be monitored every day or every other day since he has just recently restarted his HAART medications--their dosing may need to be adjusted accordingly.
Blood pressure Patient was continued on medications for his hypertension, and has been titrated up to 100mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], now that he can reliably get PO medications.
He may need further titration of his medication or additional [**Doctor Last Name 360**], such as amlodipine.
Diabetes Patient's blood sugars were under good control- 100's to 140's range, however he was taking very little PO during most of his stay.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, and it was also thought that a number of his medications, especially bactrim, were contributing to his anemia.
A number of tests were done, including blood test, tests on your cerebral spinal fluid, and imaging, which demonstrated it was likely you had an infection in your [**Doctor Last Name **].
You will need a follow up MRI of your brain to assess how well the treatment is working.
Please contact your primary care doctor or go to the emergency room if you experience fever, chills, drowsiness, new weakness, numbness, or tingling, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or other concerning symptoms.
