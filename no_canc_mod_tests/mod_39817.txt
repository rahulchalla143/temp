WBC SCAN: IMPRESSION: 1) Uptake in lingula and right mid lung, most consistent with pneumonia.
Correlate with a direct examination of the hand.
CXR [**3-1**]: Large region of consolidation or focal edema developed in the left lung between [**2-28**] and 13, and it has progressed.
However, it was later thought that her lung findings were likely more chronic and suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis rather than pulmonary edema.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Stim was normal.
Anemia- given one unit [**2176-2-18**]; Pt with significant anemia and a HCT of 27.5 w/ drift down to HCT 22.
Stool guaiacs negative here.
Hematocrit remained stable after transfusion.
She then developed bacteremia, with multiple blood cultures positive for CNS, last positive culture on [**2176-2-23**], with surveillance cultures after that negative.
The patient underwent a tagged WBC scan to further evaluate potential sources of infection, particularly her hardware from past knee and hip replacements; however a clear source was not found other than increased uptake in the lungs (suggestive of pneumonia), the back (suggestive of discitis), and the right hand (clinical exam was benign).
The patient's oxygen requirement climbed to 100% FiO2 on face mask, and was unable to be weaned.
An autopsy was offered to the family, but declined.
