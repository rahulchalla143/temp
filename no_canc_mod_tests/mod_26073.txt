At that time biopsy and pleural fluid sampling demonstrated exudative lymphocytic pleural fluid of unclear etiology as pathology only with reactive mesotheialial cells c/w chronic inflammation (pleuritis).
Went to [**Hospital3 **], noted to be 88%RA, CXR with worsening pleural effusion on left.
CT scan was performed.

[**2191-8-18**]: CT CHEST 1.
#FEVER: The patient frequently had low grade fevers overnight, especially on [**8-18**] and [**8-21**] when blood cultures were sent.
Her WBC count fell from 9 on admission to 3.4 on hospital day 6.
However, interventional pulmonology reported that the foci of air on CT was likely related to manipulation of the catheter.
However, there was no dyspnea or tachypnea throughout her hospital course and heart rate remained within a normal range with no changes in blood pressure.
Blood and urine cultures were sent and were found to be negative for any growth.
The only positive culture came from pleural fluid drained on [**8-18**] which was positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus (likely contaminant).
#RECURRENT PLEURAL EFFUSION: Pt has history of a trapped lung s/p thoracoscopy, pleural biopsy and pleur-x catheter placement.
Upon presentation, pleural fluid was drained and showed a lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion.
The etiology is unclear as only one culture was positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus (likely contaminant) and pathology negative for malignancy.
CT scan showed loculated effusion with foci of air, not being accessed by the Pleu-x catheter.
They recommended continuing antibiotic coverage for upper respiratory tract infection and attempted a subsequent drainage of the collection which only produced 20cc of fluid.
Her pleural fluid cultures were unyielding for organisms.
She was followed by serial chest films.
Throughout her course, she had upper respiratory tract mucous build up so an induced sputum culture was sent but was contaminated.
#HYPERTENSION: BP ranged 90-100's therefore her hypertensive medications were held.
#ANEMIA: Unclear baseline (27-30), but was stable throughout hospital course with guaiac negative stools and no signs of bleeding.
She was transfused 2 units of PRBC for HCT 25.
On dishcarge her HCT 27.
