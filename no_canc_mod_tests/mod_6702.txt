The patient presented to his primary care physician's office on [**8-18**] and had an electrocardiogram done which showed "PSVT" and was sent to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room.
Last echocardiogram had an ejection fraction of approximately 50%, question in [**2104-11-29**].
ALLERGIES:  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 149/78, pulse 88, respirations 27, pulse oximetry 96% on 2 liters.
Heart rate was noted to be irregular with a [**2-2**] harsh systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border.
On examination of the abdomen, the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  At the time of admission, white blood cell count was 14.6, and they fell by the time of discharge.
Last measurement done on [**8-23**] was 7.2.
Hemoglobin 12.4 at the time of admission, hematocrit 38.1, platelets were 222.
PT was 13.7, PTT was 33.3, INR of 1.3.
Chem-7 was as follows:  Sodium 137, potassium 5.5 on admission (though this specimen was hemolyzed and a repeat value on [**8-20**] showed a potassium of 4.8), chloride 101, bicarbonate 23, BUN 50 at the time of admission decreasing to 42 at the time of discharge, creatinine 2.6 at the time of admission decreasing to 2.4 at the time of discharge, glucose 103.
Troponin was less than 0.3.
Calcium measured on [**8-19**] was 8.2; although, albumin was depressed at 2.2, phosphate was 3, magnesium 1.9.
Total cholesterol 141, triglycerides 70, HDL 33, LDL was 94.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest x-ray performed on [**8-18**] and performed again on [**8-19**] showed blunting of the left costophrenic angle with minimal bibasilar atelectasis as well as flattened diaphragms.
On [**8-22**], electrocardiogram was performed again with [**Location (un) 1131**] as follows:  "Regular wide complex cardiology with left bundle-branch block configuration."
Compared to the previous tracing of [**8-18**], the QRS morphology remained unchanged; however, the previously noted atrial fibrillation has been replaced by regular rhythm underlying mechanism likely supraventricular tachycardia given identical QRS morphology clinically.
On [**8-23**], the patient was sent for electrophysiology ablation which was performed without complication, and the patient was returned to the medical floor following this procedure in preparation for discharge.
