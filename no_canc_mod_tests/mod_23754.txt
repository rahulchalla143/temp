[**2156-6-5**]:  cat scan of sinus, mandible   IMPRESSION: Multiple facial fractures as described above including fractures involving the frontal bone, the anterior process of the maxilla, both nasal bones, and right zygoma.
Blood is noted within the left frontal sinus and tracking into left ethmoid air cells.
[**2156-6-5**]: cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:  IMPRESSION: 1.
However, extraperitoneal bladder injury cannot be excluded on this study and a CT cystogram is recommended for further evaluation.
Equivocal additional punctate 1-2 mm pseudoaneurysm versus prominent vessel within the medial compartmental thigh musculature on the left.
[**2156-6-10**]:  Venous duplex studies:  Bilateral assessment of both legs was ordered; however, indication for exam gives only symptomatology on the left.
Duplex and color Doppler show no evidence of acute or chronic DVT involving either lower extremity from the common femoral through to the proximal tibial veins.
To rule out an extra-peritoneal extravasation, he underwent a retro-urogram which did not show any ureteral disruption or leak.
His imaging did show a frontal sinus fracture involving both the anterior and posterior table.
His current hematocrit is stable at 25.5.
His current white blood cell count is 8.6 and he has maintained an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air.
To better evaluate this, he underwent venous doppler studies which did not indicate a deep vein thrombosis.
His vital signs are stable and he is afebrile.
