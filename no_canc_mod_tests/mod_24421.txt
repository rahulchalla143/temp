Echo at the time revealed an LVEF of 45% with mild global hypokinesis.
Subsequent ETT revealed evidence of an inferior MI with mild ischemia, LVEF 30-35%.
He was referred previously to [**Hospital1 18**] for left heart catheterization which revealed 3 vessel disease.
[**8-7**] he was recathed at OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of revascularization.

[**2124-8-9**] ECHO Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=35%).
The left ventricle displays some improvement in global systolic function with an ejection fraction of about 45%.

A carotid duplex ultrasound was obtained which revealed a 40-59% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery and mild disease in the right.
A CT scan showed no significant intracranial process, no appreciable supra-annular calcification in minimally dilated, ascending thoracic aorta and 4mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe warrants CT reevaluation in 12 months.
Mr. [**Known lastname 89339**] was not started on an ACE Inhibitor, as his blood pressure would not tolerate it.
