CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Included views of the lung bases demonstrate mild dependent atelectasis.
The liver, stomach, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are normal.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum is normal.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
She went to an outside hospital where CT with oral contrast only demonstrated an expansion of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that was saccular in shape without an adequate neck for endovascular repair.
She was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation where she was found to be hemodynamically stable.
A CT angiography was obtained, despite an elevated creatinine, that did demonstrate concerning expansion of her aneurysm without any evidence of rupture.
She was noted to have a metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 2.3 and a WBC of 14 and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] with a creatinine on 1.6.
On POD 4 PT recommended [**Hospital 112100**] rehab.
Her white count remained elevated and UA was positive so she was started on cipro.
C. diff was negative and a PICC line was placed.
On POD 12 her urine culture grew pseudomonas and she was noted to be incontinent so her foley was replaced.
Additionally on POD 18 she was noted to have right arm swelling and an UE US revealed a partially occlusive thrombus surrounding the PICC line.
She was also noted to be hyperkaelemic from an unknown origin with a K of 6.
