Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting   History of Present Illness: 49 year-old female with type I diabetes complicated by ESRD s/p renal transplant x 2 with chronic rejection, s/p pancreatic transplant x 2, CAD s/p mulitple PCIs, severe MR complicated by severe heart failure admitted directly from Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] clinic due to [**Name (NI) 9140**] heart failure.
Of note she had a stress test in [**2127-2-7**] which showed an inferior reversible defect.
Serial TTE's have revealed [**Year (4 digits) 9140**] mitral regurgitation (thought to be ischemic in nature).
At that time the [**Month/Year (2) 9140**] MR was noted, however cardiac catheterization was not completed as there was concern that the dye load from a cath would cause her to become dialysis dependent.
Due to her [**Month/Year (2) 9140**] heart failure symptoms she is being electively admitted for cardiac catheterization tomorrow.
She will require precath hydration and renal consult due to the risk of further decline of her renal function from contrast and possible need for HD during this admission.
Depending on the catheterization results, she may also need to undergo surgical evaluation for mitral valve replacement.
