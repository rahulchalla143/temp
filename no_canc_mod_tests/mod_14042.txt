EKG in the field reported 2nd degree AV block type 1 with LBBB.
Repeat measurement of potassium demonstrated an appropriate decrease.
He was also given albuterol/ipatropium nebs which decreased his peak pressures and improved breath sounds.
CT head obtained and neg for acute intracrainal process per wet read.
Last echo 1 year ago pretty normal.

[**9-4**]: Cardiac Echo The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-9-3**], no clear change.
[**9-3**]: Head CT w/o Contrast 1.There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema or acute territorial infarction.
[**9-3**]: CT Chest with and without contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
[**9-5**]: Carotid U/S: The study is somewhat limited due to the dressing for the right internal jugular line and the neck swelling.
On the right side, the peak systolic velocity in the common carotid artery is 114 cm/sec, in the ICA proximally is 96 cm/sec, in the mid portion of the ICA is 111 cm/sec and in the distal portion 132 cm/sec.
[**9-6**]: EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study because the background activity is continuous diffuse polymorphic delta and occasional [**5-17**] Hz theta activity.
With history of cardiac arrest, hypoxic brain injury is one of the possibilities along with sedative medication, as the patient is still on a midazolam infusion.
The RCA had a new appearing total occlusion distally and an 80% AM stenosis similar to cath in [**2190**].
Selective arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent LIMA-LAD.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertension with central aortic pressure of 156/68 mmHg.
[**9-13**]: ECHO Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**9-16**]: EP study 1.
Given the patient's extensive cardiac history, arrhythmia, ischemia, and poor contractile function were considered as potential etiologies.
Echo was relatively unrevealing at bedside (EF 45%)and his troponins was stable over subsequent days.
ARDS, PE, Pneumonia, and aspiration were considered.
The chest CT suggested a pulmonary process, but greatly improved on the second day, suggesting aspiration pneumonitis.
Patient was initially also started on broad spectrum antibiotics which were discontinued on subsequent days as he remained afebrile with normal urine and blood cultures and without any source of infection.
Based upon presumption diagnosis of cardiac arrest, the cooling protocol was initiated and continuous EEG was started, revealing nonspecific slowing.
The patient's primary process was thought unlikely neurologic in origin given dramatic hemodynamic sequelae of the event and negative CT head along with nonspecific slowing  on EEG.
He also had a cath which showed severe three vessel disease with new occlusion in the RCA and attempt at opening CTO of RCA was unsuccessful.
Subsequently he han EP study which did not reveal any inducible tachyarrhythmia or any new conduction abnormalities.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] as an outpatient for further evaluation and management of his CAD.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient will follow up with PCP for further management of his severe GERD - Patient will follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] for further evaluation for his CAD.
Information was obtained from Family/Caregiver.
You were on a breathing machine with low blood pressure and underwent a cooling protocol.
A cardiac catheterization showed blockages in your arteries but the physician was unable to open any artery.
An electrophysiology study to assess your conduction system did not show any abnormalities besides a known mild type of heart block (left buncle branch block).
Your voice is hoarse after the breathing tube and you have an appt with an ear, nose and throat doctor on [**9-26**].
