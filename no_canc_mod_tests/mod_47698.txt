Bacteremia:  The patient's blood cultures as noted previously grew methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus.
Blood cultures following this positive set remained negative throughout the remainder of the [**Hospital 1325**] hospital course.
A followup CT was performed to assess the abdominal phlegmon which was noted on an earlier abdominal CT.
The phlegmon was considered to be more amenable to drainage, which was performed through CT guided aspiration in the Interventional Radiology Department.
Cultures did not show any active infection.
Gram stain was negative.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis:  The Hepatology team continued to follow the patient while on service.
Her liver function tests remained within normal limits, however, her INR remained elevated at 1.4.
Patient was instructed to have her LFTs checked on a weekly basis while remaining on oxacillin and to followup with Hepatology for further management plan regarding her cirrhosis.
An echocardiogram was performed to assess the patient's ejection fraction as well as her rales.
Shortness of breath:  While the patient was in-house, followup CT of her chest showed multilobar pneumonia.
A CTA had been performed given the patient's ongoing hypoxemia as well as for positive D dimer during her hospitalization.
The workup for this included a CTA to rule out pulmonary embolus, electrolytes checked to assess for volume status, echocardiogram, telemetry, and serial EKGs.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient's creatinine remained stable.
Otherwise, her BUN and creatinine remained stable as well as her urine output.
