[**Hospital 15405**] mentioned that she was lethargic, and that her GCS was 8.
When she was intubated at [**Hospital 15405**] with etomidate (20 mg then 10 mg), succinylcholine (100 mg) and vercuronium (10 mg), she had non-sustained Vtach and needed 150 mg of amiodarone, and an amp of bicarb and magnesium, given 1 g Dilantin, 10 U insulin with an amp of D50.
At the OSH, her first set of cardiac enzymes were negative but in the transfer paperwork, there was question of an anterior septal MI.
In the OSH, her potassium was 3.2, sodium 139, her INR was 0.95, Plts 261, crit 38.8.
She was initially put on Propofol, but because of her blood pressure dropping too much, she was given doses of Fentanyl before she was transferred here by Mediflight.

This area of hemorrhage, is largely unchanged since examination from [**2158-10-23**] from outside hospital.
No significant interval change from outside hospital CT performed on [**2158-10-23**].
A dedicated chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
ECHO [**10-24**]  The left atrium is normal in size.
If clinically indicated, a cardiac MR may better assess the pattern and degree of LVH.
EKG [**10-23**]  Baseline artifact.

This is unchanged in size and appearance from prior exam on [**2158-10-23**].
CXR [**10-23**]  FINDINGS: Portable semi upright AP chest radiograph is obtained.
CXR [**10-26**]   FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited by moderate right sided oblique position and rotation .
CXR [**10-28**]  This examination is limited due to respiratory motion, no focal consolidation is noted.
CT chest [**10-29**] obtained to evaluate pulmonary nodule seen on CTA neck.
Questionable decrease compared to prior imaging from [**2158-10-23**].
Close followup with chest CT probably after administration of antibiotics is recommended in six to eight weeks for documentation of resolution.
PET CT would not be helpful at that point since both entities might potentially be PET positive.

Her neurological exam improved in terms of mental status after extubation [**10-25**], with major deficit involving L gaze preference but movements past midline, R sided dense flacid hemiparesis.
A dedicated chest CT on [**10-29**] showed a right upper lobe mass-like consolidation with adjacent cyst or less likely cavity, as well as bibasilar consolidations and tracheal secretions.
Patient did not have clinical signs of PNA on examination or by history (occasional cough, well maintained O2 saturations and no fevers), thus was not treated with antibiotics.
A follow up CT witin 6weeks could be considered.
She underwent a repeat speech and swallow evaluation on [**10-30**] which resulted in recommendations of a regular solids, thin liquids diet, w/ TID oral care and 1:1 supervision to ensure aspiration precautions, assist with self-feeding, encourage alternating between bites/sips.
It was felt that her ECG changes were typical of anterior ischemia, but given low Trponin elevation and HTN, may have been due to her acute intracranial process as well as some demand ischemia by cardiology service.
An outpatient stress test was also suggested.
This may be uptightrated as needed for SBP goal of < 140 systolic.
Her BP regimen included metoprolol 37.5 mg TID, HCTz 25 daily and ACE-I as above at time of discharge.
An outpatient EP evaluation for possible pacemaker was recommended by cardiology.
Wound cultures grew MSSA sensitive to Bactrim.
Her WBC was persistently elevated in range of 11.5-12.5 throughout admission, felt to be due to thrombophlebitis.
Fe studies showed high Ferritin, normal TIBC.
Oustanding issues: - ICH - BP control, PT/OT - CV - HR control, goal 60s -70s w/ BB, cardiology outpatient follow up and EP follow up to be arranged.
- Heme - outpatient evaluation of microcytic anemia.
