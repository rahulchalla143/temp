Laboratory studies in the ED were notable for normal chem 7, normal PT/PTT/INR at 11.9/31/1.1, no leukocytosis at 10.6, hematocrit of 44.8, and lactate 1.0.
Repeat lactate at 6PM was 2.6, but had dropped to 0.8 by 8PM after fluid resuscitation.
LFTs were also wnl with ALT 31, AST 37, AP 65, Tbili 1.3.
Lipase was 26.
Blood culture, Urine culture were sent.
CXR was performed, which was benign, with clear lung fields, normal cardiomediastinal silhouette, and normal osseus and soft tissue structures.
Then was found to have heart rate dropping to 30s (transiently) and also with respiratory depression.
Tender to palpation in RLQ > RUQ.

Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.

No liver abscess or CT evidence of cholangitis.
CBD dilation to 13 mm is likely post-cholecystectomy.
Renal ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation.

He underwent CT of the abdomen, ultrasound and MRCP.
The CT scan showed common bile duct dilitation compatable with prior cholecystectomy.
Ultrasound showed the same.
The patient also underwent MRCP which showed no stones in the CBD or pancreatic duct.
