TTE [**11-3**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CXR PA/LAT [**11-3**]: IMPRESSION: Emphysema with superimposed pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo male with h/o CABG in [**2186**], PTCA [**2192**], s/p stenting [**2197**], smoking, HTN, HLD, and diabetes who is presented with chest pain and was found to have NSTEMI and acute diastolic CHF exacerbation.
Cardiac catheterization showed proximal occlusion of SVG to OM and thrombus.
However, repeat catheterization was successful with deployment of DES to the 95% occluded SVG to OM lesion.
# Acute Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbation: Mr. [**Known lastname 71328**] was without history of CHF but was hypoxic of NRB on arrival to CCU with prominent rales on exam, CXR c/w with pulmonary edema, and peripheral edema.
TTE showed LVEF of >55%.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: His creatinine on admission was 1.3 (up from baseline of 1.1).
This was likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of MI and diastolic CHF.
His Cr returned to baseline with diuresis in spite of contrast loads from two C.Caths.
# COPD:  Pt does not have dx of COPD, but with flattened diaphragms and parenchymal findings on CXR consistent with COPD in the context of extensive smoking history.
His blood pressure should be re-visited in the outpatient setting.
# Hyperlipidemia: Stable with TC of 137 and LDL of 68.
Your blood pressure was a little low while you were in the hospital so we made some changes to your blood pressure medicines.
If your blood pressure goes back up yuor doctor may want to restart some of these medicines.
DECREASE carvedilol to 6.25 mg twice a day 3.
