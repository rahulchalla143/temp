The patient was noted to have a flail chest, presumably from ?CPR vs. trauma.

Imaging: CT Head non-contrast ([**5-5**]): There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
CT C-spine ([**5-5**]): There is no evidence of acute cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
Evaluation of the prevertebral soft tissues is limited due to endotracheal and orogastric tube placement.
Ground-glass opacities in the imaged lung apices are better assessed on CT torso of the same date.
CT Torso ([**5-5**]): 1.
CXR ([**5-7**]): There is an endotracheal tube and a feeding tube whose distal tip is not well seen.
LAD 95% proximal stenosis with 40-50% stenoses in mid-, distal-, and diags.
Lcx 40% prox stenosis, RCA 40% mid vessel dz.
HR 60 --> 146 (88% of predicted).
BP 118/68 --> 160/80.
Occasional APCs and VPCs on EKG but neg for ischemia.
LVEF 62% with normal contractile function.
Peripheral arterial testing [**2184-10-1**]: no PAD in right or left leg.
ECHO [**2187-5-5**]: RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
CARDIAC CATH [**2187-5-5**]: Findings ESTIMATED blood loss: <30 cc Hemodynamics (see above): Coronary angiography:  left dominant LMCA:  No angiographically apparent CAD LAD:   Proximal calcification.
Further predilation and then able to deliver a 3.0 x 30 mm Resolute stent.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis.
CTA CHEST [**2187-5-9**]: TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis prior to and following the uneventful administration of 120 cc Omnipaque intravenous contrast.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified with intravenous contrast to the subsegmental levels without filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver enhances homogeneously without evidence of hepatic laceration.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is relatively decompressed by a Foley catheter in place.
CT CHEST [**2187-5-10**]: FINDINGS:  A previously large pneumothorax, barely visible on chest radiograph, is tiny.
This study was not designed to evaluate sub-diaphragmatic contents.
An abdominal MRI is required for further characterization when the patient's acute issues have stabalized.
CT HEAD [**2187-5-10**]: FINDINGS:  There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or territorial infarction.
Recommend nonemergent followup with MRI for further evaluation.
[**5-16**] CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS: CT CHEST:  The thyroid gland contains an 8-mm hypodense lesion in the inferior left lobe (2:13).
Calcification of the coronary arteries is noted with a possible stent in the left anterior descending artery.
A right-sided chest tube is unchanged in position, extending through the fissure with the tip terminating in the right lung apex.
CT ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of solid organs is limited without intravenous contrast.
The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable without evidence of wall thickening or obstruction.
CT PELVIS:  The prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
[**5-16**] MRI CSPINE FINDINGS: Limited examination due to patient motion.
[**5-24**] VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY FINDINGS:  Video swallow fluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with speech and swallow division.
He underwent cardiac cath with placement of DES to mid-LAD, and post-cath arctic sun cooling protocol.
He was taken for cardiac cath and recieved DES to mid-LAD on [**2187-5-5**].
Monitored on EEG for seizure activity while on NM block, no seizures seen.
There were many discussions about whether his vifb was secondary to acute MI or not, and ultimately it was felt that there was not evidence to confirm either way.
CXR the following day confirmed lead placement and interrogation by the EP team showed that it was functioning well.
CXR revealed right apical pneumothorax and trauma surgery placed a pigtail catheter on [**2187-5-8**].
Initially, this tube drained air and serosanguinous fluid and repeat CXR showed improvement in the pneumothorax.
He was requiring very high PEEP and FiO2 90-100% to maintain saturations in the low to mid 90s.
His blood pressures were also noted be decreased during this time.
Because the differential included pulmonary embolus and he was not clinically improving, a CTA chest was performed on [**2187-5-9**].
Trauma surgery returned and placed a right chest tube on [**2187-5-9**] with repeat CT chest the following day showing resolution of pneumothorax.
He remained febrile and sputum culture grew pseudomonas so ciprofloxacin was added to the regimen while awaiting sensitivities.
Patient had EEG performed early in his stay which showed mild/moderate diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm, however was notable for background frequencies with the appearance of an anterior-posterior gradient of frequencies, clear reactivity, and improvement in the alpha rhythm frequency which was thought to be associated with good neurologic outcome.
CT imaging showed no acute intracranial process but did show multiple rib fractures from CPR.
His C-spine was cleared with CT neck on admission and C-collar was removed per trauma surgery recommendations.
Head CT showed no acute process, and there was concern for critical illness neuropathy vs. myopathy.
Repeat MRI's showed poorly defined subacute to chronic lesion in C1 to C2.
He had a video swallow and speech/swallow team evaluation which cleared him for a diet of pureed solids and honey-thick liquids.
His pressures decreased with SBP's in th 90's in the setting of new pneumothorax.
His initial CK was very high 800s in the setting of being found down and trauma, AST/ALT also very high (see below).
He should have these rechecked in a month or so and also should have a f/u MRI of his liver for nondescript findings on CT.  # H/o depression: not currently being treated for this, but has taken meds in the past.
-Follow-up needed for Liver lesion seen on Ultrasound- recommended a nonemergent MRI to further characterize - recheck CK and AST/ALT after stabilized as an outpatient to ensure no toxicity from high dose atorvastatin - To improve his sleep/wake cycle in the setting of sundowning, he was started on seroquel 25mg po qhs prn for insomnia and delirium.
Medications on Admission: - metoprolol succinate 12.5mg po daily - lisinopril 20mg daily - simvastatin 40mg po qHS - plavix 75mg po daily - insulin humalog SS + long acting insulin qHS (in [**2183**] he took lantus 25 units qHS)  Discharge Medications: 1.
Your lab work and EKG showed that you had a large heart attack.
You underwent a cardiac cath with placement of a stent in your heart to open the artery and restore blood flow.
Follow up needed for: You will need to have an MRI of your liver to assess an area that they noticed on an ultrasound that would need to be further defined.
When you leave, they will arrange for an appointment with your primary care doctor: Name: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 247**] M.
