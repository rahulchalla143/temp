These are indeterminate by CT criteria and may be further evaluated with renal ultrasound.
This is unchanged from multiple prior studies and may represent an adrenal nodule.
Contrast enhanced study may aid.
ECHO [**11-22**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-10-26**], a mild regional left ventricular wall motion abnormality is now seen c/w CAD, Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now present.
CATH [**11-22**]: 1.
Diastolic dysfunction and elevated systemic blood pressure.
Pt was treated with meropenem for 2 week course (end [**12-7**]) from first negative blood culture on [**11-23**], and midline was placed to continue the course as an outpt.
Given the persistent elevated WBC, pt was screened for C Diff and although was negative x 3, was treated empirically with PO flagyl while on Meropenem for the bacteremia.
Echo showed normal EF, interatrial aneusym and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall, distal septum and apex.
As an inpatient, her blood pressure has been well controlled on Metoprolol and Lisinopril with SBPs in 110-120s.
Pt was medically managed with ASA, statin, beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor and evaluated for CABG by CT surgery.
She will need outpt follow up for preop workup and scheduling.
C diff was sent and negative x 3 but per ID recs, given high white count and broad, will continue getting prophylactic flagyl dosed at hemodialysis while on 2 week meropenem course.
DIABETES: Blood sugars were treated with insulin sliding scale while oral meds were held.
