FINDINGS: A single semi-upright radiograph of the chest was obtained and compared to prior exam performed [**2133-4-24**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Aortic bioprosthesis is stable and functioning well, with residual peak and m ean of 25 and 12 mm of Hg.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 177**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6888**] MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2133-4-20**] 5:50 AM Final Report: MR BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST AND MRA HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL HISTORY: 69-year-old man with 30 minutes of the left hand/arm/chest and neck pain/numbness, evaluate for ischemia.
Multiple areas of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity are again noted in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, not significantly changed since the prior examination, and a nonspecific finding.
MRA HEAD: The left vertebral artery demonstrates decreased flow compared with the prior examination, likely representing interval stenosis.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 55%.

Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2133-4-22**] **ARTERIOGRAPHY RESULTS MORPHOLOGY % STENOSIS COLLAT.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal left and right sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 9 mmHg and an RVEDP of 7 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.6 L/min/m2.
Systemic artery systolic pressure was normal with an SBP of 126 mmHg.
There was moderate to severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 40 mmHg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.98 cm2.

CARDIOLOGY FELLOW: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] R. ATTENDING STAFF: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] E.   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6682**] was admitted to the BIMDC on [**2133-4-20**] for further work-up of his chest pain and left arm numbness.
The neurology service was consulted and a head CT followed by an MRI were performed which were negative.
As he had known aortic stenosis, a cardiac work-up was performed.
A stress test with myocardial perfusion scan was negative.
An echo revealed severe and worsened aortic stenosis.
A cardiac catheterization was also performed which showed no significant coronary artery disease.
A carotid ultrasound was negative for any significant carotid artery disease.
His bypass time was 95 minutes with a crossclamp time of 83 minutes.
