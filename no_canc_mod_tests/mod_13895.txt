Studies: AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2104-12-18**]:  Subtle pericolonic stranding in the cecum, ascending colon, thought likely to reflect an infectious etiology.
ECHO [**2104-12-22**]:  EF  25-30%, new pan-wall motion abnormalities   Brief Hospital Course: # SOB: The pt's shortness of breath is most likely related to fluid overload since he developed the SOB after missing his scheduled HD.
The CXR was consistent with fluid overload.
On the evening of admission, the pt was noted to have a low blood pressure of 70/40 with a heart rate of 119.
He did not complain of any CP, SOB, light headedness or dizziness.
An EKG showed Afib with RVR, in addition to anterior ischemia.
The pt's heart rate came down to the mid 80s to mid 90s.
The pt's low BP responded to IV fluids and was 100-110s/60-70s after the pt received 1.5L of fluid during the episode of RVR.
Three sets of cardiac enzymes were stable and did not suggest any myocardial infarction.
The pt's EKG after converting back to sinus rhythm showed no persisting evidence of infarction.
LFTs and TSH were sent in case pt would need to be started on amiodarone.
On the morning of [**12-18**] the pt spiked a temperature to 102.2.
Pt's labs showed a WBC of 17.8.
Pt was made NPO and had an upright AXR which showed no free air but was limited due to pt's body habitus.
Pt was evaluated by surgery who recommended a CT abdomen which showed mild stranding around the cecum and mild wall thickening????
Stool cultures and C. diff toxin were sent.
A focal area of necrosis was found in the ascending colon without gross fecal contamination.
The pt noted that he has felt more tired since his metoprolol dose was increased dueing his last admission.
The pt's Metoprolol dose was decreased from 200mg QD to 100mg QD and Diltiazem was added for further rate contol.
