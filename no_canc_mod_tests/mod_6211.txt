PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Heart rate of 94, blood pressure of 113/62, respiratory rate of 24, saturations of 95% on a breather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed blood coming from his ear and occipital laceration.
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Initial laboratories revealed a hematocrit of 41.3.
PTT of 29.2, INR of 1.4.
Blood urea nitrogen of 15 and creatinine of 1.1.
Creatine kinase was 1205, MB of 15.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Initial chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax, no widened mediastinum.
CT of head showed a subarachnoid bleed with basilar skull fracture.
A CT of the chest showed a fracture of multiple thoracic vertebrae, hemothorax on the right.
CT of the abdomen showed no intra-abdominal injury.
CT of the abdomen also revealed L3 lumbar body compression fracture, bilateral pubic rami fractures, bilateral two sacral fracture.
IMPRESSION:  A 72-year-old male, status post approximately 12-foot to 20-foot fall with subarachnoid hemorrhage, basilar skull fracture, multiple thoracic and lumbar spine fractures, bilateral pubic rami fractures, and altered mental status.
The patient was found to have a very poor ejection fraction and required fluid and pressors to maintain his blood pressure.
It was unclear what his baseline cardiac status was; however, per his cardiologist in [**State 4565**], he had a very poor ejection fraction of approximately 20%, and his baseline blood pressure was approximately 100 to 110 systolic.
His hematocrit remained stable.
A repeat CAT scan of his head showed mild improvement in his injuries with no worsening.
His echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of just less than 20%, and he was eventually weaned off of his pressors.
His blood pressure stabilized at his customary range of systolics of 100 to 110 off pressors, and he was continued on his home medication regimen of amiodarone, Lasix, and lisinopril.
The patient's fever trended down, and his white blood cell count stabilized, and his antibiotic regimen will be tailored prior to discharge.
The patient was started on erythropoietin, and his hematocrit stabilized at approximately 30, requiring no further transfusions.
His coagulation studies remained stable, and he had no further hematologic issues.
His multiple orthopaedic injuries were either fixed or immobilized including operative repair/internal fixation of his thoracic spine and lumber spine.
