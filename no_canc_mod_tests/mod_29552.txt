Her vital signs were stable.
She had mild edema and her neurological exam was unchanged from prior.
LABORATORY:  Her white count was 1.3.
Hematocrit, 32.7 and platelet count of 355.
Sodium, 137; potassium, 2.9; chloride, 102; bicarbonate, 18; BUN, 33; creatinine, 1.9; blood sugar, 120.
Baseline creatinine is approximately 1.3 to 1.4.
Urinalysis was sent which showed positive nitrites and positive leukocyte esterase and from 10 to 20 white blood cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is admitted with urinary tract infection to the Medical Service and given antibiotics to cover both Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and gram negative rods and continued on her medications.
During her hospital course, a CT scan was obtained which found a large abscess in her low pelvic region which also showed mild air in that region as well consistent with a perforation near her anastomosis of her colon.
Her white count was slowly increased and on [**2161-11-21**] it was 20.7.
She was followed very closely by the Surgical Service and Urology was also consulted for the evaluation of left hydronephrosis which was noted on CT scan.
On [**2161-11-21**], in the evening, the patient was noted to have increasing abdominal pain and temperature to 101.5.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room where an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and loop colostomy was performed.
She did well postoperatively, however, her blood pressure was quite labile and she had a temperature spike to 103.2 and was hypotensive.
In the Intensive Care Unit, she slowly improved with widened antibiotics and Neo-Synephrine was used for blood pressure support, however, it was able to be weaned off after initial episodes of hypotension.
She was started on continuous bladder irrigation at a very slow rate and this was found to help clear the feculent material from the bladder and her blood pressure slowly resolved.
Her temperature curve came down.
Her white count stayed elevated for a significant time before returning to normal prior to discharge.
A repeat KUB at the time showed dilated loops of small bowel and it was decided that she would be made NPO.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and the output of the colovesicular fistula reduced.
The Vanco was stopped after Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was not identified in the urine and Flagyl was stopped after cultures were negative for anaerobes.
Her chemistries all returned back to her baseline with a BUN of 38 and a creatinine of 1.3.
The patient had calorie count which were done, however, for two of the three days, the patient was kept NPO for procedures, therefore, the calorie counts were continued until this time as an adequate and correct count could be done.
She is also kept on Insulin sliding scale for her TPN coverage and her blood sugars were well controlled with that.
TPN per her order sheet and plan to have TPN labs checked twice weekly until completely stable.
