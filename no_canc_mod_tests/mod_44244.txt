CARDIOVASCULAR (A) PUMP:  The patient had an ejection fraction of 30%.
During her last couple of weeks of hospitalization, the patient had relative hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 80s, most likely due to hypovolemia, poor p.o.
Although her white blood cell count was increased in the last two days of admission, she was not febrile and there were no other signs of sepsis.
She received isotonic fluid boluses for a systolic blood pressure of less than 85 or for symptoms.
A chest x-ray was repeated on [**2138-9-19**] because the patient had an increased respiratory rate and an oxygen saturation in the mid 80s on room air.
Her blood pressure responded well to fluid boluses.
Her Coumadin was held for her thoracentesis on [**2138-9-13**] and her atenolol was continued.
On [**2138-9-17**], because her INR was 3, her Coumadin dose was decreased to 3 mg h.s.
On the following day, her INR was even higher and, on [**2138-9-19**], her INR was 3.6.
On [**2138-9-13**], a chest x-ray showed pleural effusion, left greater than right, which was tapped on [**2138-9-13**] with symptomatic relief and an output of 750 cc of bloody fluid.
The patient was placed on 100% nonrebreather mask for a few hours after her tap and then a repeat chest x-ray was taken.
This repeat chest x-ray showed some return of the left sided pleural effusion.
Cultures were negative and cytology was pending.
Another repeat chest x-ray was done and, because of the reaccumulation of fluid, it was decided to place a chest tube on [**2138-9-16**].
On [**2138-9-18**], talc pleurodesis was done without complications and was placed to suction.
On [**2138-9-19**], her chest tube was removed by the cardiothoracic surgery service and she was given Percocet for pain treatment.
A chest x-ray after the chest tube was removed was essentially unchanged.
They recommended a repeat of the head MRI to rule out watershed infarct, since they also saw proximal right sided weakness.
The MRI did show a new right sided posterior parietal lesion.
A left shoulder x-ray was within normal limits.
On [**2138-9-20**], a head CT scan was repeated secondary to her acute and chronic hypotension.
The head CT scan was negative for an acute process.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was placed on aspiration precautions and the speech and swallow team followed her while she was in the hospital.
This was sent for a urinalysis and culture, which were negative.
