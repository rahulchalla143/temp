IMAGING: CT neck with contrast [**2103-4-13**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT neck was obtained which was unrevealing for focal collection.
The patient was instructed to follow up with Allergy as an outpatient by calling the number they had given her, as well as with her PCP the following business day to have her INR checked and her anticoagulation adjusted accordingly.
# Superior mediastinal lymph nodes: increased in size compared to previous CT scan in [**11-3**].
You underwent a CT scan of your neck which did not reveal any noticeable pockets of infection, and were seen by Allergy and Ear Nose and Throat doctors, who felt that your swelling was most likely a form of allergic reaction ("angioedema"), possibly to cefaclor, that may sometimes worsen to the point of compromising breathing.
Given your initial symptoms, a neck CT was done and showed some enlarged lymph nodes which had grown slightly since imaging from last [**Month (only) 359**].
You also have lupus, and lupus anticoagulant with history of blood clots; your warfarin was continued while you were hospitalized.
We made the following changes to your medications: 1. discontinued cefaclor 2. added prednisone, to be taken 60 mg from [**2016-4-13**], 40 mg [**2019-4-17**], 20 mg on [**4-21**].
* Please have your INR checked on Monday and sent to your PCP.
