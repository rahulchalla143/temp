Admission Date:  [**2114-6-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-6-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-1-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: adhesive / Pravastatin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**] Chief Complaint: Cold left foot  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2114-6-1**] Left groin exploration   History of Present Illness: HPI: 69F with a longstanding history of PVD who in [**2103**] underwent left fem to above knee popliteal bypass and has subsequently had multiple vascular interventions.
Past Medical History: HTN / CVA x2 ([**2096**]) / DM / depression / PVD / eczema / L fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] ([**2103**])/ L CEA [**2097**] / bilateral carotid stents / L TKR / choly / Left Lower Extremity Angiography w/ iliac stent placement / left common femoral artery angioplasty ([**2111**])   Social History: Smoker.
CT ANGIOGRAM: Severe atherosclerotic calcifications are again seen throughout the abdominal aorta and iliac branches.
Three-vessel runoff is demonstrated (3A:293), however, there is marked attenuation of the left anterior tibial artery in comparison to the prior CT examination (3A:345), and diminutive flow is seen at the dorsalis pedis.
Patency of the right profundus femoral is demonstrated.
Evaluation for the right popliteal artery is impossible due to the degree of extensive calcifications and streak artifacts from the right knee prosthesis.
A three-vessel runoff is demonstrated at the right calf, with irregular attenuation throughout the right posterior tibial artery, all unchanged since [**2114-2-23**].
Three-vessel runoff demonstrated at the left calf, however, there is overall decreased vascular flow, in particular the left anterior tibial artery, in comparison to the [**2114-2-23**] examination, likely from poor iliac and femoral inflow.
