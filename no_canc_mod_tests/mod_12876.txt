His SBP was in the 160s on presentation, and he was given Labetalol 20 mg IV X 1 given, followed by Nitroprusside drip started at 0.1 mcg/kg/min, titrated up for goal SBP<120.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T 98, HR 62, BP 116/74 on Nipride, RR 11, Sat 96% on room air.
VITALS: T 98, HR 56, regular, BP 94/45, RR 16, Sat 99% on 2L via NC.

Relevant data in hospital:  [**2196-2-15**] CT CHEST W/IV CONTRAST: Diffuse emphysematous changes are noted throughout the lungs.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is in place within the urinary bladder.
CT ARTERIOGRAM WITH IV CONTRAST, RECONSTRUCTIONS: The ascending aorta demonstrates borderline enlargement, measuring 4 cm in maximal axial dimension.
Unfortunately, since a noncontrast CT scan of the chest was not performed prior to contrast administration, acute hematoma vs. chronic thrombus cannot be distinguished.
The right common iliac artery measures up to 3.4 cm in maximal axial dimension, and the left common iliac artery measures 2.8 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year-old male with a history of HTN and AAA rupture s/p AAA repair 6 years prior to admission, who presented to an OSH with c/o abdominal pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given concern for possible thoracic aortic dissection.
1) R/O aortic dissection: The OSH CT was reviewed on admission with the radiology resident, with a differential diagnosis of descending thoracic aortic dissection versus hematoma.
CT surgery was consulted and recommended medical management with heart rate and blood pressure control.
A repeat CTA was performed on [**2196-2-15**], which revealed penetrating ulcers within the distal descending thoracic aorta, with slight wall thickening felt to possibly represent a thrombus versus hematoma, but without evidence of dissection.
He remained pain free in the CCU, and was transitioned to oral medications with Metoprolol and Captopril, both titrated up to meet goal blood pressure parameters.
Norvasc 5 mg PO QD was added on the day of discharge for tighter blood pressure control.
A lipid profile revealed LDL 84.
He will need follow-up LFTs.
He will need close BP monitoring as an out-patient.
He will also need a repeat CTA torso to assess interval change in [**6-15**] weeks.
A CT chest revealed no infiltrate, but was significant for diffuse emphysematous changes.
