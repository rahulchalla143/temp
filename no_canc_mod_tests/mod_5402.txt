Bell's Palsy - occurred earlier this year in the context of an ear and sinus infection.
Blood in stool - she relates BRBPR in the past, and was scheduled for a colonoscopy to work this up on [**10-21**].
She took a weight loss medication, "hydrocut" (?)

ECHO ([**10-14**]) The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Stress results ([**9-30**]) IMPRESSION: No objective evidence of myocardial ischemia by EKG in the setting of atpyical anginal symptoms and shortness of breat at a moderate absolute workload.
RPP - 26,000 MPHR - 84%   Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 25 year old woman with a 4 year history of progressive fatigue and recent chest pain, palpitations, and signs of volume overload (orthopnea, PND, increased AM urination, air hunger) who has been recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology and partially worked up.
She was admitted for further workup and possible invasive monitoring via swan ganz catheter.
Rate/rhythm - During her hospitalization, the patient was in sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs and ventricular bigeminies.
Apparantly when seen in clinic prior to admission her heart rate was in the 30s, but she remained in the 60-90s while admitted.
Pump - On an ECHO done on [**2140-10-14**], the patient's EF was 30-40%; however, the patient was in ventricular bigeminy during the procedure making the EF results questionable.
However, her clinical presentation on admission was relatively stable, and invasive monitoring was decided against.
She will get a cardiac MRI next Thursday to re-evaluate her EF while she is not in ventricular bigeminy.
Cardiomyopathy workup - The patient per her recent ECHO had a depressed EF but no significant dilation or hypertrophy.
- Sarcoid - this type of infiltrative cardiomyopathy was high on the differential given the patient's demographics as well as the ?hilar findings on the chest xray.
An ACE level was sent and was pending on discharge; a chest CT did not show any hilar lymphademopathy or any concerning findings for sarcoid.
She so far has had the following workup: HIV neg, EBV neg, CMV neg, Hep B neg, HCV neg, lyme neg, rubella neg, PPD neg 1 year ago.
- ETOH - sent ggt (neg), patient also denies ETOH use; also this is usually a dilated CM.
- Hemochromatosis - not consistent with her anemia and iron studies done in the past.
The cardiac MRI should help clarify this.
Pulmonary - right hilar abnormality in previous CXR, but not present on chest CT.
Renal - stable creatinine during admission.
GI - h/o gastritis, GERD, BRBPR, had been scheduled for a colonoscopy on Friday [**10-21**] but had to miss it due to her admission.
She will reschedule this exam as an outpatient.
Prophylaxis - ambulatory, tolerating an oral diet, tylenol.
Please call your insurance company and ask if "A cardiac MRI with contrast" needs pre-approval from your doctor.
Please call the "Holter Lab" ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3104**]) to set a time to get your 24 hour monitor ("[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of hearts monitor").
