He presented to [**Hospital6 **] on [**8-24**] with fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia and cough, and was diagnosed with necrotizing pneumonia due to coccidioides immitis by CT and bronchoalveolar lavage.
Past Medical History: -Inflammatory Myositis s/p biopsy [**6-3**] started on methotrexate and prednisone, unclear as to etiology (not inclusion body myositis)  Diagnosed at [**Hospital3 2568**]... -coccidomycosis pneumonia -right sided pneumothorax s/p CT -rectal bleeing [**1-31**] hemorrhoids -ARf -hyponatremia -thrombocytopenia -anasarca -cholestatic hepatitis  Social History: retired mechanic married no tobacco occassional etoh born in [**Location (un) 57512**] [**Country **], emigrated here in [**2119**]  Family History: not obtained  Physical Exam: 98.4, 94/50, 92, 24, 94%5L Gen illapearing jaundiced anasarcic male in nad HEENT icteric, EOMI, PERRLA, dry MM with small ulcer on R tongue Neck supple, no lad, jvp not elevated PULM: R lung with coarse rales and wet throughout, L lung with good air movement CVS rrr nl s1 and s2, no rubs, murmers, gallops Abd soft mildly distended, hypoactive BS, HSM not appreciated Ext 4+ pitting edema, 2+ pulses all extremeties Neuro CN intact, AAOx2, cerebellum intact Skin: Bilateral petechial rashes on LEs  Pertinent Results: MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The study is limited by patient motion.
There are no areas of low signal on susceptibility sequences to indicate the present of blood products.
IMPRESSION: Limited study secondary to patient motion.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]:  TECHNIQUE: 3D time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
ID: At outside hospital culture data revealed Coccidomycoses in both blood and sputum, enterobacter on [**8-30**] bronchoscopy and GPCs on [**9-16**] bronchoscopy.
Here on admission, the patient was placed on zosyn and vancomycin for anaerobic and GPC coverage, ambisome 400 q24 and caspofungin for coccidioides coverage, all cultures re-sent including washes from bronchoscopy.
A lumbar puncture was performed to determine the need for intrathecal ambisome, however no organisms were seen on microscopy or cultured.
At this hospital, his blood cultures demonstrated Vancomycin resistant enterococcus bacteremia but no coccidomycosis fungemia, sputum cultures showed coccidomycosis, pleural fluid had VRE and coccidomycosis.
Linezolid was started for VRE, and subsequent survellience cultures were negative.
Bronchoscopy revealed diffusely erythematous airways without purulent secretions and a likely RML empyema.
Ultrasound at outside hospital showed no obstruction.
He was bolused frequently and given PRBCs to keep intravascular oncotic pressure up and to reach goal MAP > 65.
FEN: Mr. [**Known lastname 57508**] became grossly edematous with an albumin 1.5.
His primary care physician from [**Name9 (PRE) 4565**] sent records of a biopsy which indicated that myositis was not inclusion body.
His methotrexate was stopped but his prednisone was continued at a lower dose to avoid an adrenal crisis in this patient under great stress.
Cardiac: Mr. [**Known lastname 57508**] was found to be hypotensive, but his EF was 60% at the outside hospital.
An EKG done here on [**9-19**], revealed poor Rwave progression.
Cardiac output was boosted with IVF boluses for BP and stress dose steriods, started [**9-19**].
