He was then found unresponsive again at 7am and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Sputum and BAL cultures grew Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas.
In the ED the patient's vital signs were T 98.8, BP 86/53 , HR 98, RR 16 , O2 sat 97-100% on AC 500/12/.[**5-15**].
Lactate 1.9, first set of cardiac enzymes negative.
CXR showed alight proximal migration of right-sided PICC line with tip now terminating within the mid subclavian vein, persistent right middle and lower lobe collapse, increased patchy airspace opacities at the left lung base which could represent pneumonia or aspiration.
He received 2L IVF with improvement in systolic BPs to 100s.

1)Unresponsiveness - Unclear etiology, initially suspicous for infection and he was treated with vancomycin after his PICC was removed and tip culture was positive for coag negative staph.
His blood cultures remained negative after 48 hours so his vancomycin was discontinued.
2)Hypotension - He continued to have intermitent, asymptomatic episodes of hypotension with SBP in the 80's- 90s.
His blood pressure responded to IVF boluses.
3) Pneumonia - On admission he was still being treated for his recent positive sputum cultures on his previous admission which were positive for pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas.
