Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo M with HTN, HLD, DM, no known CAD s/p SFA stent for RLE non-healing ulcer, who coded x 2 at [**Hospital3 **], found to have diffuse 3 vessels disease, presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management with possible surgical intervention.
Cardiogenic shock as also presumed given the global hypoperfusion indicated by the patient's elevated lactate and anion gap acidosis.
The inciting factor for cardiogenic shock was not clear, but the patient in the cath lab at OSH was noted to have 3VD, and there were comments in OSH regarding arrhythmia, which seems to be the two most likely factors to have instigated cardiogenic shock.
Lactates were trended with bicarbonate provided to keep pH greater than 7.15 in order to maintain effectiveness of pressors.
The plan was for cardiac enzymes to be cycled.
# Neuroprotection s/p arrest: Patient is not a candidate for Artic Sun Cooling protocol given the amount of time since his event and start of cooling.
He was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam, and  # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine is 3.1, up from a baseline of around 1.3 per OSH records.
The patient is not currently febrile, and CXR shows diffuse bilateral infilitrates not consistent with a PNA.
