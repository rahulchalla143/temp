She has had a colonoscopy previously, which showed diverticulosis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CHF with diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 70 percent in [**2139**].
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.5 to 2.5.
INITIAL EXAM IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT:  Temperature 97.9, heart rate 72, blood pressure 180/54, respiratory rate 16, and oxygen saturation 96 percent on room air.
INITIAL LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.1, hematocrit 39.4, platelets 390.
Sodium 141, potassium 4.6, BUN 60, creatinine 1.7, INR 1.0.
PTT 24.5.
Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia, congestive heart failure, mild cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration.
In the Emergency Department the patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response resulting in hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s and 90s.
Attempts were made to slow her rate with IV Lopressor, so when her rate did not respond, electrical cardioversion was attempted with 200, 300, and then 360 joules without success.
Her rate was eventually slowed to the 110-120 range with IV Lopressor.
Upon transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient again developed rapid atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 130s to 140s.
She was given 15 mg of IV diltiazem, which showed her rate into the 60s and 70s, and converted her into normal sinus rhythm.
The patient's hematocrit dropped from 39 to 31, and she had no further episodes of bright red blood per rectum throughout the remainder of her Intensive Care Unit stay.
The patient was seen by Gastroenterology, and underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed diverticular disease and one nonbleeding arteriovenous malformation, which was cauterized.
The patient has a baseline anemia with a hematocrit that had been around 30 for the past several months.
Her colonoscopy was negative for any malignancy, however, given her history of Barrett's esophagus, she should have an outpatient EGD as surveillance for esophageal malignancy.
The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 70 percent and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient was mildly hypertensive during her ICU stay with blood pressures in the 140s-170s as her antihypertensives were held during fluid resuscitation.
