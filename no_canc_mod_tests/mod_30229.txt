On returning to the  ED, she was found to have bilateral marked papilledema; a head CT was consistent with significant global edema with marked sulcal effacement and ventricular narrowing as well as swelling adjacent to the basal cisterns.

This is likely secondary to cerebellar edema, and though the amount has progressed since the prior MR of the cervical spine from [**Month (only) **] [**2103**], the supracerebellar cistern remains patent.
[**2107-10-18**] MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM: There appears to be a slight improvement in the extent of the abnormal T2 signal hyperintensity throughout the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.

NEURO: CT imaging showed limited sinus disease, but marked diffuse cerebral edema.
The neurological exam was remarkably non-focal.
Her HAART therapy on admission was continued with the addition of ampicillin, and urine, sputum, and blood cx's were sent.
MRI revealed diffuse T2 signal abnormality and 8mm downward displacement of cerebellar tonsils.
Given the high level of concern for CNS infection, and after discussion with ID and neurosurgery, it was decided that an LP was necessary.
A repeat MRI was performed first, and showed no progression of edema and no change in the level of the cerebellar tonsils.
Ms. [**Known lastname 1313**] [**Last Name (Titles) 97584**] to the procedure, and the LP on [**10-11**] revealed OP 30, 11 wbc (lympho) 0 rbc protein 50 glucose 96.
Gram stain was negative for bacteria or poly's.
CSF bacterial and fungal cultures were negative.
CSF viral load was 1350 despite peripheral load of 424.
During the course of the admission Ms. [**Known lastname **] neurologic exam remained non-focal, with some mild difficulties with executive function.
Her repeat MRI on [**10-19**] showed improvement in the edema and white matter changes.
Following tests were sent on [**10-7**]: HCV Ab, Cryptococcal Ag negative, VZV IgG positive, CMV IgG positive and IgM negative, EBV IgG positive and IgM negative, Toxo Ab negative, Lyme serology negative, RPR negative, Mycoplasma Ab negative for acute infection.
Ms. [**Known lastname 1313**] had a wbc of 9 on admission, wbc of 17 on the day of LP, and peak wbc of 28.5 on [**10-17**], all with neutrophilia.
She had multiple cultures of blood and urine sent, all of which were negative, and chest x-rays were negative as well.
A repeat MRI was obtained to ensure that her behavioral changes were not related to [**Known lastname 9140**] herniation with injury to basal forebrain structures, but the MRI was actually improved.
She attempted to leave the hospital and a "Code Purple" was called, as the patient was in danger of harming herself.
Her psychosis seemed to wax and wane over the course of the day.
An EEG was obtained due to concern for temporal lobe epilepsy and revealed no epileptiform activity.
