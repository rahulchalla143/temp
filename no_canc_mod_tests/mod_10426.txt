On initial examination by the Gyn Service, the patient was noted to have greenish exudate emanating from an open 3 cm incision.
Wound cultures were sent and the patient was started empirically on Ceftazidime and Clindamycin and admitted to the gynecology  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: Temperature 99.1, heart rate 74, blood pressure 122/56, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 94%to 96% on room air.
CHEST:  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Examination indicated regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2 and a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
The patient's wound gram stain was positive for 3+ gram-negative rods.
On hospital day #3, the patient was noted to have a low-grade temperature to 100.2, as well as decreased urine output with 90 cc over twenty-four hours.
Blood pressure was noted to be 82/42.
Urinalysis indicated 11 white blood cells, occasional bacteria and one subcutaneous epithelial cell.
Creatinine was also noted to rise to a peak of 4.0.
Shortly, thereafter, the patient's oxygen saturation was noted to drop to 83% on three liters.
She was noted to have diminished breath sounds at the bases and ABG indicated pH of 7.24, pCO2 of 73, pAO2 of 326.
Chest x-ray did not indicate any signs of overt congestive heart failure and there were no effusions.
Antihypertensives were stopped and Medicine consultation was obtained.
Repeat blood cultures were sent and negative.
On hospital day #4, to patient continued to have borderline urine output, however, the creatinine improved with hydration.
The patient was then transferred to the Medicine Service on hospital day #5 due to delirium, borderline O2 sats and eval of hypercarbia.
Blood cultures continued to be negative.
The creatinine continued to improve and on hospital day #6, it was down to 1.2.
The patient's urine output also improved dramatically.
On hospital day #6, the followup ABG indicated a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 42 and PO2 of 60.
Given that the patient's hypercapnia appeared to have resolved, it was decided that her transient hypercapnia might best be worked up as an outpatient in the context of pulmonary evaluation and/or a sleep study.
The Department of Physical Therapy was consulted and their recommendations were still pending at the time of this dictation.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient's antihypertensive medications were continued to be held until her blood pressure again became problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
[**Name2 (NI) **] low dose beta blocker was resumed on [**4-21**] and sbp 100-110.
Could consider readding at later date if BP rises but will need close monitor of renal function.
MRSA colonization 12.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11333**] in [**Name (NI) **] Pt should have pulmonary eval as outpatient including f/u of oxygenation, PFTs and sleep study to eval baseline hypoxemia and possible OSA/obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
