The mother remained stable until the night prior to delivery when she developed a fever to 100.7 and painful contractions.
Ultrasound revealed estimated fetal weight of 1028 grams and a biophysical profile of [**5-16**] with an amniotic fluid index of 1.4.
Heart rate greater than 100 decreased briefly to 60-80 and then increased again.
Apgars were 6 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.
PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ADMISSION:  Weight 1.02 kilograms, 50th- 75th percentile; head circumference 24.5 cm, 25th percentile; length 37.5 cm, 50-75th percentile.
In general, she was an active, appropriately developed preterm infant vigorous with exam in moderate respiratory distress at rest with SIMV.
She had a continuous soft grade 1/6 systolic murmur on exam and remained with normal blood pressures.
A cardiac consult was obtained on [**12-23**] at which time an EKG was obtained which was normal.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed which revealed a clinically insignificant PDA without left-to-right shunting.
Currently, her heart rate is 140-160, blood pressure 73/40 with a mean of 51 and a soft holosystolic murmur is present at the left upper sternal border.
She was also started on potassium chloride supplements with her Diuril and continues with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] supplements at discharge 2 mEq by mouth twice a day.
Her electrolytes were in range.

Her last electrolytes were on [**2-3**]: Sodium 138, potassium 5.9, chloride 105, CO2 29.
She received phototherapy from day of life 2 through 11 with a peak serum bilirubin of 5.7/0.3 on day of life 7.
Hematology/ID: Baby's blood type is O-positive, DAT negative.
She received 1 blood transfusion on [**12-8**] of pack red blood cells for a hematocrit of 28.9.
Her most recent hematocrit is 33.2 with a reticulocyte of 1.4%, and her current iron dose is 0.3 mL by mouth daily.
Infectious disease: A CBC and blood culture were obtained upon admission.
Her CBC revealed a white count of 12 with 28 polys, 18 bands, 40 lymphocytes, 2 metamyelocytes, and 2 myelocytes.
Her blood culture remained negative.
Her placental pathology revealed cellular changes consistent with acute chorioamnionitis.
She received 7 days of antibiotics at which time a lumbar puncture revealed pleocytosis with a white count of 15,000, 33,000 red blood cells, protein 231, glucose 20.
A repeat lumbar puncture upon completion of antibiotics reveals a white blood cell count of 28, a red blood cell count of 600, total protein 157, and glucose 39.
Gram stain and culture remained negative.
Neurology: Head ultrasound on day 7 revealed moderate ventriculomegaly.
Serial ultrasounds performed subsequent to that on day of life 10 and subsequent to that on [**11-27**], [**12-15**], [**12-27**] revealed ventriculitis, echogenic material in the lateral and 4th ventricle consistent with meningitis.
On [**12-27**], a follow-up ultrasound showed the ventricles to be normal size.
Her most recent head ultrasound on [**1-31**] revealed the ventricles to be normal in size, parenchymal echotexture is normal, and no extra-axial fluid collections seen.
Her most recent head circumference is 35 cm.
She was noted to have upper extremity tightness upon her initial exam felt to be due to the oligohydramnios.
Sensory: [**Known lastname 65231**] passed her hearing screen.
Ophthalmology: Initial exam was performed on [**12-18**] at a month of age at which time her retinas were shown to be immature.
Serial exams revealed progressive retinopathy of prematurity advancing to stage I, zone II in the left, immature zone II on the right.
Name of primary pediatrician is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29768**] [**Hospital2 59306**] [**Hospital3 37830**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 65233**].
Car seat position screening was performed prior to discharge and was passed.
Initial screen showed increased tyrosine level likely secondary to parenteral nutrition with normal follow up.
Subsequent screens reveals an alpha-thalassemia trait.
FU testing is pending in the state lab.
Subsequent to that, [**Known lastname 65231**] received Pediarix on [**1-25**] and also received the pneumococcal conjugate, Prevnar on [**1-25**], and HIB vaccine on [**1-25**].
Cardiology program  at [**Hospital3 1810**], appointment on [**3-12**]; telephone number is ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 52423**] and Dr.[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], [**Location (un) **] Pediatric Ophthalmology ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 65064**].
