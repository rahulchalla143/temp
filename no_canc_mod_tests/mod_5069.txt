Impression: Ulceration in the rectum compatible with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum   Brief Hospital Course: # Hypotension, concern for GI bleed - Blood pressure appeared to be at her baseline per ED records and according to her is similar to her baseline.
Her blood pressure remained stable at all times.
The patient's initial INR was 1.9 so she was given 5 mg po vitamin K for reversal prior to colonoscopy and prep with Magnesium Citrate.
The colonoscopy showed a small rectal ulcer.
Renal was consulted and recommended a fistulogram, which could not be performed during hospitalization, so she should have this arranged as an outpatient and receive dialysis through the catheter until then.
# elevated alk phos/LFT's - her alk phos and AST were noted to be elevated on admission, with slightly elevated GGT.
An EKG showed no changes and the patient remained at sinus.
