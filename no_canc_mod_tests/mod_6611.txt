Abd Dopper/RUQ U/S ([**10-10**]): IMPRESSION: Repeat occlusion of TIPS stent.
Head CT ([**10-10**]): IMPRESSION: Unchanged head CT with no acute intracranial pathology.
Chest/Abd/Pelvis CT ([**10-10**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR ([**10-12**]): IMPRESSION: Atelectasis left lower lobe.
CXR ([**10-14**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study earlier in this date, there is some prominence of interstitial markings with [**Last Name (un) 16765**] lines, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
CXR ([**10-17**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the sequence of previous films from earlier in this month, there has been clearing of the left pleural effusion.
Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
CT from [**10-10**] showed a transition point in the mid-distal ileum and no ascites.
Surgery was consulted and an NG was placed with return of 1.5L of bilious fluid.
Initial hematocrit of 41 was likely due to dehydration as her baseline is in the mid 20s.
Her hematocrit trended down to 22.9 with stool guaiac negative on multiple occasions.
She was transfused 1 U pRBCs on [**10-14**] and about 1 hour later developed acute pulmonary edema with SBP 200 and HR 130.
The blood bank was notified due to the possiblity of TRALI.
Her hematocrit rise was appropriate and remained in the mid 20s.
Her platelets remained stable with negative HIT antibodies.
Her BUN and Cr were elevated on admission to 46 and 2.2, respectively, up from baseline BUN [**6-21**] and baseline Cr 0.8-1.0.
Her creatinine improved to 1.3 by the time of discharge and her diuretics were resumed.
