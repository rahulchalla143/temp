On her initial examination, her temperature was 101.0, her pulse was in the low 100s and her pressures were in the 110s.
Her exam was essentially remarkable for a 4 x 15 cm area of erythema with tenderness at the inferior aspect of her sternal wound with necrotic debris emanating from the incision.
Her white count was 11.7.
Her BUN and creatinine were 23 and 0.7.
She had a chest x-ray which showed that her sternal wires were still intact, but CT scan to further evaluate the wound showed a defect in the anterior soft tissue with inflammatory changes with gas in the region of the mediastinum.
Incidentally, on CT scan, a 22 x 17 mm right thyroid nodule was noted as was a 4 mm lung nodule at the right lung base and a 26 x 28 mm adrenal nodule, all of which require follow-up imaging in the future for further characterization.
Blood cultures were obtained as were wound cultures.
She never evidenced any sort of sternal instability and follow-up chest x-rays did not show any change in location of her sternal wires or development of any new pleural effusions.
On the day of her discharge, her T-max was 100.0.
Her white blood cell count was 6.7.
One of four blood culture bottles did also grow out coag-negative staphylococcus, but this was felt to be a contaminant and follow-up surveillance blood cultures were negative.
She will have her VAC changed every 3 days with follow- up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Plastic Surgery in 1 week at his office.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**8-6**] days for further outpatient workup of the incidental thyroid, lung and adrenal nodules found during workup of the wound infection.
