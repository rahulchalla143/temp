LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Physiologic MR TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is globally, moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
At a cardiac output of 6.5 liters/minute, the maximum gradient across the valve was 28 mmHg woith a mean gradient of 13 mmHg and an effective area of about 1.9 cm2.
Small residual pleural effusions and stable normal-appearing postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette, heart size increased since the last preoperative study on [**9-30**].
EKG Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-9-29**] the left bundle-branch block is new.

A subsequent  investigation showed severe aortic valve regurgitation with some dilatation of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction about 35%.
A`coronary angiogram had non obstructive coronary artery disease.
He was taken to the operating room and had Aortic valve replacement with a mechanical St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] size 23-mm valve, his bypass time was 145 minutes with a crossclamp of 132 minutes.
On POD1 he was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
The remainder of his hospital stay was uneventful, he continued to progress and was cleared for discharge to home on POD 6 His INR is to be followed by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 838**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4775**]  Medications on Admission: ZYRTEC 10 mg once a day ASPIRIN 325 mg once a day   Discharge Medications: 1.
