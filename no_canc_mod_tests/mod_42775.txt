On evaluation at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], she was noted to have dysarthria and ataxia on exam.
Labs were wnl, and a CT head showed extensive deep white matter hypodensity extending to the subcortical regions most likely representing chronic small vessel ischemia, but no acute infarction.
CTA showed occlusion of the basilar artery and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Microbiology: [**2184-7-31**] 10:38 pm SPUTUM      Source: Expectorated.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2184-8-2**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Radiology: Non-Contrast CT of Head ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]): There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2184-7-31**] 10:01 PM IMPRESSION: No interval change from earlier study with density to the basilar artery, likely reflecting already demonstrated basilar thrombus.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The 17 mm wedge-shaped low-attenuation focus in the periphery of the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere corresponds to the relatively acute infarct at this site, demonstrated on the MR study obtained roughly 9 hrs later.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2184-8-2**] 5:35 AM FINDINGS: Wedge-shaped hypodensity in the inferior aspect of the left cerebellar hemisphere (series 2, image 8) has evolved since reflecting infarction.
This noncontrast study is suboptimal for vascular assessment.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2184-8-4**] 4:45 PM IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-severe apical predominant centrilobular parenchyma.
CTA HEAD AND NECK W&W/O C & RECONS	Study Date of [**2184-8-8**] 5:46 PM HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Again confluent areas of low attenuation are redemonstrated in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which are nonspecific and may reflect chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
A more conspicuous area is noted on the left pons related with ischemia and demonstrated on the prior T2-weighted sequence MR examination dated [**2184-8-1**].
CTA OF THE HEAD: Persistent filling defects are redemonstrated in the basilar artery, causing significant narrowing at the mid segment of the basilar artery, clearly identified in the rotational images.
CTA OF THE NECK: Significant atherosclerotic disease and plaques are visualized at the aortic arch, the origin of the supra-aortic vessels appears patent and also demonstrates multiple atherosclerotic plaques.
Visualized osseous structures demonstrate multilevel degenerative changes consistent with anterior and posterior spondylosis, more significant from C3 through C6 levels.
Cardiology: Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2184-8-2**] at 10:11:15 AM Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
She was started on a heparin drip and an MRI/MRA was done that showed an inferior left cerebellar infarct and a small right pontine DWI abnormality.
Repeat head CTs showed no changes.
She will need INR checks and a goal INR of [**2-12**].
Neurological examination revealed dysarthria and gait instability but normal cerebellar function and no other focal neurologic signs.
CT scan at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] was negative for acute infarct but CTA showed an abrupt cut-off in the lower midbasilar with distal reconstitution and a hypoplastic left vertebral artery.
She was started on a heparin drip and an MRI/MRA was done that showed an inferior left cerebellar infarct and a small right pontine DWI abnormality.
Risk factors were addressed and HbA1c was 5.8%, lipid panel showed Chol 162 TGCs 122 LDL 95.
Given smoking and asbestos hx with pleural plaques requested CT-chest which showed COPD changes and pleural plaques but no mass.
Patient was treated with a HISS and BP was allowed to autoregulate and initially the goal was to keep the BP elevated to prevent hypoperfusion.
Echo showed mild pulmonary HTN, LVEF >55% and no cardiac source of embolism found.
Repeat head CTs showed no changes.
Patient was transitioned to warfarin and heparin was stopped when INR >2.
Repeat CTA head showed Significant narrowing of the basilar artery, more significant at the mid segment related with atherosclerotic disease in addition to diffuse atherosclerotic changes in the distal branches of the middle, anterior and posterior cerebral arteries.
BP was controlled and home atenolol and amlodipine were held, using hydralazine 10 mg IV if necessary for SBP >180.

Neurology: Good power in arms and legs - mild left weakness.
Finger nose ataxia on left with rebound.
Has episodes of worsened speech and this does not seem to be associated with her basilar thrombosis   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you [**Last Name (un) 22034**] your sty at the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
You were found to have a blood clot in your basilar artery - the main blood vessel supplying the base of the brain.
You had several CT scans and an MRI scan which showed and small stroke in the left cerebellum which coordinates movement in the left side of the body and accounts for your reduced coordination on that side.
