Per report, the patient subsequently went into asystolic arrest at about 2:30PM on [**8-10**] requiring defibrillation, epi 1mg x4, atropine 1mg x1, vasopressin 40units x1, lidocaine 100mg x1, Amiodarone 150mg x1, bicarb, Ca returning her to sinus rythm.
In the ICU, a PA line was placed demonstrating CVP 16, PAP 85/35 and PCWP 40 with CO 1.4.
A R fem A-line was placed, as was a temp pacing wire for bradycardia.
Bedside echo showed EF 40%.
ABG at the time of transfer was 7.35/31/60 on 100% Fi02 and PEEP 5.
Due to family request, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
She underwent lung biospy and evaluation by pulmonology showing likely UIP/IPF and was started on high dose prednisone.
Past Medical History: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF: Echo [**2149-6-13**]: EF >55%, 1+ MR, severe pulm HTN, RV dilation c/w overload - Pulmonary HTN: R heart cath on [**6-19**] with pulmonary artery pressure 79/59 mm Hg.
- IPF/UIP--likely from aspiration pneumonitis-Patient has documented room air saturation of 85%.
Diagnosis is Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis/UIP per thoracotomy and lung biospy - Paroxysmal Afib with RVR with h/o conversion pauses to sinus.
The mean RA pressure was 5mm Hg.
The RV systolic pressure was 42mm Hg.
The mean wedge pressure was 12mm Hg.
The pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was 42mm Hg, with an elevated PVR of 200 dynes-sec/cm2.
The cardiac index was 4.5 l/min/m2.

Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and pulmonary vascularity is engorged.
Compared with the prior tracing of [**2149-6-19**] anterolateral ST-T wave changes are more prominent and QTc interval is shorter.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 F with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, PAF, severe pulm HTN and R heart failure, DM2, HTN, s/p renal xplant in [**2143**] presents from OSH after episode of CP/SOB and cardiac arrest on day of transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
CXR without sign of pneumothorax.
