HD Tunnel catheter placement  History of Present Illness: This is an 87-year-old female with a past medical history significant for end-stage renal disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and anemia, who lives at a nursing home and was noted to have decreasing urine output and increasing BUN/creatinine.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 4, status post AV fistula placement complicated by stenosis status post by angioplasty with only residual stenosis.
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.1, blood pressure 126/72, heart rate 84, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.

[**1-15**]: CT Head IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited examination, however, no evidence of acute intracranial pathology or hemorrhage.
If needed, the scan could be repeated at no additional cost to the patient or further evaluation of etiology of altered mental status may be assessed with MRI.
Further evaluation angiographically may be warranted.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
An aortic valve vegetation/mass cannot be excluded.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-1-8**], the estimated pulmonary artery pressures indicate at least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
If clinically indicated, a TEE may better assess for vegetations given  suboptimal echo windows.

A CT scan of her head on [**2139-2-5**] did not reveal any acute processes.
Serial arterial blood gases during hospitalization did not show any evidence of hypoxemia or hypercarbia.
Fluid shifts during hemodialysis were felt to be a contributor, though it should be noted that her fluid balance was maintained neutral during that session.
Her hematocrit remained stable at this time, making blood loss an unlikely contributor.
Her cosyntropin stim test was also without evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
On her third transfer to the medical intensive care unit following her PEA arrest at hemodialysis, ECG initially showed a new right bundle branch block that was concerning for a pulmonary embolus or myocardial ischemia.
However, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed no new wall motion abnormalities and no signs of right ventricular strain.
Subsequent CT, pulmonary angiogram did not demonstrate any evidence of pulmonary emboli either.
Her hematocrit was monitored subsequently and noted to be stable.
Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated normal ejection fraction.
Two sets of blood cultures grew different strains of coagulase negative staphylococcus.
Transthoracic echocardiography did not demonstrate any evidence of valve vegetations.
Her tunneled hemodialysis catheter was left in place, as these positive blood cultures were not felt to represent bacteremia.
Iron studies were consistent with mixed iron deficient and anemia of chronic disease etiology.
An H. pylori antibody was sent as recommended by the gastroenterology consult service.
