Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-6-1**] 10:32 PM Wet Read: AGLc WED [**2174-6-1**] 11:14 PM right scalp swelling and rt temporal bone fracture extending into middle ear with blood in EAC and middle ear.
Radiology Report CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-6-1**] 10:33 PM Final Report CT C-SPINE: The skull base through the top of T3 demonstrates no evidence of acute fracture, malalignment, or paravertebral hematoma.
CT does not afford intrathecal detail as does MR; however, note is made of degenerative change, particularly at C5-6 and C6-7 where posterior disc and osteophyte causes narrowing of the canal and indentation of the thecal sac anteriorly.
Canal narrowing at C5-6 and C6-7 are due to degenerative changes; correlation with mechanism of injury and neurologic exam is recommended, and if there is concern for cord injury, MRI would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-6-2**] 5:43 AM Final Report NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Areas of hemorrhagic contusion in the left temporal lobe and inferior left frontal lobe appear little change.
Layering high density along the left posterior cerebral hemisphere is consistent with a small subdural hematoma, which demonstrates distribution since the last study and measures up to 4 mm in thickness posteriorly.
IMPRESSION: Little change in exam compared to CT head of seven hours prior with right temporal bone fracture and left temporal and inferior frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhagic contusions, left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and left posterior subdural hemorrhage.
PFI: Little change in exam compared to 7 hours prior with left temporal and left inferior-frontal hemorrhagic contusions, left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and left posterior subdural hemorrhage, which causes local sulcal effacement without shift of normally midline structures, without new intraventricular extension of hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-6-2**] 4:22 PM No mediastinal hematoma is noted.

His repeat Head CT was stable.
His exam was non focal.
Cervical spine was cleared by trauma and chest CT revealed left rib fractures, [**5-24**].
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
