IMAGING [**2129-7-9**] PORTABLE CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-13**] through [**6-29**]: Severe consolidation in the right lung has worsened since [**6-27**].
The diffuse pulmonary process, more severe in right lung, has not significantly changed since the previous exam but overall is gradually worsening since [**6-29**].
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-7-18**], the aortic valve has been replaced.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-17**], the patient is no longer obliqued.
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen, making it difficult to evaluate the lung behind it.

Preoperatively, Balancing blood pressure with volume overload was challenging, as diuresis limited by hypotension.
His platelet count dropped and he had a negative HIT/SRA.
He had evidence of gastritis and duodenotis on EGD on [**7-18**] without evidence of active bleeding.
He underwent colonoscopy on [**7-27**] which showed evidence of diverticulosis but no evidence of active bleeding.
His trach was changed 3x secondary to persistent leak, tracheomalacia extending to both mainstem bronc's noted, currently with 8.0 [**Last Name (un) **].
He had evidence of a resistant pseudomonal VAP sensitive to imipenim and cefepime from culture results from [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital1 18**].
Also treated MRSA given sensitivities of sputum culture from OSH (Was on bactrim [**2039-7-9**], vanc [**2044-7-14**]).
Over the next week he continued to be diuresed and his betablockers were restarted.
