He had a CT scan which was negative for dissection but showed a pericardial effusion and small left pleural effusion.
An ECHO was then performed, which showed a moderate to large pericardial effusion, with sigs of tamponade and RV collapse.
Patient was given 4 L of NS, and his SBP remained in the 90s.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for pericardiocentesis, where he was found to have sinus tachycardia to 133, BP 118/76, 100% on 2L and afebrile.
Patient became hypotensive to SBP 80s, which responded to IVFs.
Patient had pericardiocentesis, which showed an initial pericardial pressure of 24 mm Hg.
Patient was then admitted to CCU for further workup and evaluation.
