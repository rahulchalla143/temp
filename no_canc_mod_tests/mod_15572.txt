The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] from [**2-13**] to [**2-13**] to evaluate a left main stem after a rigid bronchoscopy on [**2-3**] showed some mild irregularities with a reportedly negative workup.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on arrival on [**2102-4-17**] revealed white blood cell count was 10.6, hematocrit was 32.3, mean cell volume was 86, and platelets were 339.
Sodium was 137, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 38, blood urea nitrogen was 7, creatinine was 0.7, and blood glucose was 101.
INR was 1.2.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Imaging on [**2102-4-17**] showed high-grade stenosis of the airway at the level of the insertion of the tracheal tube, likely extensive granulation tissue.
A computed tomography of the chest from [**2102-2-12**] showed trachea course altered secondary to marked kyphoscoliosis, narrow AP dimension of thorax at the thoracic inlet, and aberrent calcification of airway noted particularly left main stem and lower bronchi), dependent right pleural effusion.
A bronchoscopy on [**2-3**] showed irregularity in the middle main stem bronchi.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 98.9, blood pressure was 138/77, heart rate was 96, respiratory rate was 16, 97% on room air, FIO 2.4.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to light.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
SPEECH LOSS:  The patient was admitted for evaluation of speech loss.
A chest computed tomography showed high-grade stenosis of the airway above and at the lateral insertion of the tracheostomy tube; likely due to extensive granulation tissue (performed on [**2102-4-18**]).
On [**2102-4-19**] a rigid bronchoscopy was performed.
The rigid bronchoscopy showed complex tracheal stenosis with slit like lumen located 2.5 cm below the vocal cords with an estimated length of a few millimeters.
A trial of AC was performed; however, this was not tolerated by the patient.
