TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images of the abdomen and the pelvis were obtained without the administration of intravenous or oral contrast.
FINDINGS: The evaluation of abdominal organs and major vessels are extremely limited due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
The limited evaluation of the abdominal organs demonstrates no focal liver lesion.
Multiplanar reformation images confirmed the above finding.
CT study for the evaluation of mesenteric vessels and abdominal organs for mesenteric ischemia without intravenous contrast.
An orthopedic screw is identified in the right femur.
Recommend CT for further evaluation.
An endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right subclavian catheter remain in place.
