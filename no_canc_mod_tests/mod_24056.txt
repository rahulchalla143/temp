Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2129-1-7**] CXR - Congestive heart failure with perihilar and interstitial edema as well as small pleural effusions [**2129-1-9**] CXR - Again seen is an ICD with lead terminating in the right ventricle.
Compared to the film from the prior day, there has been no significant change [**2129-1-10**] ECHO - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
[**2129-1-11**] CXR - Improved opacity within the right lung base, likely due to resolving atelectasis.

female with OSA/COPD (on home O2 with BIPAP at night), schizophrenia, CAD s/p CABG, CHF with EF 40% presents with dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory distress > CHF flare.
On admission here her ABG was 7.27, PCO2 93, PO2: 105.
After ~4-6 hours she became more responsive and pH rose above 7.3.
On the 3 night of hospitalization she was somewhat agitated and was given 15 mg temazepam (7.5 x 2) which she takes at home to sleep.
Subsequently she became more lethargic and an ABG was 7.11/132/134.
She was then placed on Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) mode through the CPAP mask with pressures of 18 and had tidal volumes of ~450 with a rate set at 22.
Over the next 2 days she was able to be weaned to BiPAP at night only (using her home nasal BIPAP mask) and it was decided that we would not check blood gases unless she had a change in mental status and would not prematurely start BiPAP (prior to the evening) unless her pH was <7.3.
3) CHF with EF 40%.
As she was initially hypertensive, she was started on a Nitro drip with good blood pressure control.
Strict I/O, 1 liter fluid restriction, daily weights, Low Na diet were maintained.
Creatinine was 0.9-1.1 throughout admission.
Her blood sugars became more elevated after initiation of the steroid taper.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was called and the patients glyburide was increased to [**Hospital1 **].
