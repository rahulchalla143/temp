Repeat echo showed depressed EF at 30%.
BNP measured and noted to be increased to 1500, creatinine peak at 2.8 from baseline 1.3, and AIN was suspected in the setting of the reaction to Ceftaz.
Cardiac: HTN, CHF, CAD s/p CABG [**2113**], most recent cath in [**2119**] with patent grafts; ECHO [**2120-12-5**] EF 45-50% 1+ MR, [**3-12**]+TR, Pulmonary HTN, hx of NSVT 2.
ECHO Study Date of [**2120-12-30**] 1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (30-35% ) Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include basal inferior, inferoseptal and inferolateral akinesis .
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.

CXR sent w/ pt on transfer [**12-29**] notable for bilateral infiltrates [**3-12**] way up both lung fields.
ABG at time of intubation revealed a respiratory acidosis.
She may require a formal sleep study on an outpatient basis to determine if she does indeed require CPAP.
CV: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG with reportedly patent grafts by cath [**2119**].
She had Cardiac output of 9 with low SVR of 460 showing a picture more consistent with septic as opposed to cardiogenic shock.
The catheter was used for several days for intensive monitoring to keep MAP >60, CVP >10, and PAWP >20.
Her cardiac enzymes were cycled during this admission and she did not have a rise in her troponin.
She was oliguric for several days, but slowly recovered her renal fuction and urine output improved with down trending creatine.
Renal was consulted during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay for concern for AIN in setting of Ceftaz administration but results from urine sediment were more consistent with ATN (muddy brown casts seen in urine and patient had relatively quick recovery).
Hct remained stable.
Anemia of Chronic Dz: On admission to ICU, patient had iron studies which were abnormal but non-diagnostic in the setting sepsis.
She was transfused to keep HCT > 28 based on significant cardiac history.
Hemolysis work-up was performed during hospital stay which was negative.
Septic Arthritis of right hip: Aspirate done on [**12-28**] at [**Location (un) 620**] showed rare growth of coag neg staph that was pan-sensitive.
After initial removal of hardware on [**12-5**] the patient was started On vanco and levo and was planned to continue these antibiotics until [**2121-1-19**] for supposed GNR and definite GPC on gram stain in OR [**12-5**].
After transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], ortho was consulted and a x-ray film of the patient's right hip was obtained showing joint space widening and potential areas of continued infection.
Gram stain results revealed 3+ polys, no organisms, no fungus, and the culture had no growth.
