Her liver function was notable for transaminases with an ALT and AST of 9500 and 17,500 respectively and worsening hyperbilirubinemia.
Given the critical nature of her illness, she was transferred to the transplant surgical service and to the surgical intensive care unit for further management.
This management initially entailed aggressive control and monitoring of intracranial pressures in conjunction with the neurosurgical service.
This was followed serially with CT scans and there was no progression of the bleeding.
On [**2187-11-12**], the patient was extubated and her neurologic exam was notable for response to voice and opening of her eyes.
In terms of her cardiovascular status, the patient initially had blood pressure support with the use of vasopressors in order to minimize her intravascular volume which was thought to exacerbate her cerebral edema.
This was evidenced by progressive ability to metabolize her lactate, stabilization of her blood sugars, and autocorrection of her coagulopathy.
The patient's transaminases were elevated; this was thought to be secondary to a possible mild ischemic pancreatitis which might have developed during her requirement for vasopressors.
The patient's renal function, which had been quite labile throughout her hospitalization, stabilized, with creatinine in the 2.9-3.4 range.
Sputum cultures failed to evidence any pneumonic process, and these antibiotics were discontinued.
The patient required special HLA-typed platelet transfusions in order to maintain a platelet count above 100,000.
