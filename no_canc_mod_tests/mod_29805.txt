Per her grand daughter who lives with her, Mrs. [**Known lastname 4020**] was in her usual state of health until this morning when she asked her granddaughter to feel her chest as she felt her heart was beating very quickly and she was short of breath.
CXR showed a large right sided infiltrate.
There was transient hypotension to SBP 70s-80s prior to intubation, which resolved with IVF.
She is on fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and current VS are: T 101 (given 650mg APAP PR) BP 126/60 HR 112 RR 16 O2 100% on CMV Vt 450 with PEEP 5.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2141-7-19**] the findings are similar.
[**10-30**] CXR PA & Lat: In comparison with the study of [**10-27**], there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the right, and basilar compressive atelectasis.
[**2141-11-1**] transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-8-28**], the estimated pulmonary artery pressures are markedly higher.

She was intubated in the Emergency Room and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) where she spent a brief period of time on levophed to keep her blood pressures adequate.
Her blood and sputum cultures were all negative.
Repeat chest imaging suggested an increasing component of fluid overload, for which she was treated with diuretics.
After transfer to the floor the patient began to demonstrate signs of increasing volume overload on her CXR and physical exam.
A repeat echocardiogram was obtained and showed severe pulmonary hypertension, moderate right ventricular dilation and mild global hypokinesis, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved left ventricular function, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and mild to moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation.
She will need continued monitoring of her daily weight, Ins and Outs (weigh diapers/pads), and physical exam to determine her current volume status and need for additional diuresis.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Once her blood pressures were stable, the patient was continued on her home regimen of Metoprolol 25 mg twice daily for rate control, and Coumadin for anticoagulation.
Her INR level fluctuated, likely secondary to concurrent antibiotics, so this will need to be monitored and re-dosed as needed in the future (goal INR [**2-15**]).
# Acute exacerbation of chronic venous stasis: Upon transfer to the floor it was evident that the patient was experiencing an acute [**Month/Day (3) 9140**] of her chronic venous stasis.
Her hematocrit remained close to baseline 25-30 during this admission.
Fe studies revealed a low Fe (19), low-normal ferritin (74), and decreased TIBC.
# HTN: The patient's blood pressures remained in the systolic range of 90-110 and diastolic range of 50-60 while being actively diuresed.
Outpatient Lab Work Patient needs PT/INR, CBC, and Chem 10 (Na, K, Cl, HCO2, BUN, Cr, Glucose, Ca, Mg, Phos) every M, W, F. Please notify MD with results.
We also obtained a picture of your heart called an echocardiogram, which showed slight [**Hospital1 9140**] of your valve function which you should follow up with your cardiologist.
-Please INCREASE the FREQUENCY of Furosemide to 80 mg twice daily -You will be discharged to the rehab facility with nebulizers to help your breathing as your pneumonia resolves  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
