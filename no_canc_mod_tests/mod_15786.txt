PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Room, his vital signs were 99.9; heart rate of 115; blood pressure 120/60; respirations 26; saturating at 100%.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count was 14.8; hematocrit was 42.3 and his platelets were 186.
INR was 1.2.
Urinalysis was negative.
Sodium was 135; potassium of 3.3; chloride 96; bicarbonate 20; BUN 12; creatinine 1.0; blood sugar 157.
ALT was 80; AST was 43.
Alkaline phosphatase was 73.
Total bilirubin was 0.8.
Amylase was 46; lipase was 49.
CK was 76 with a troponin of less than 0.01.
Electrocardiogram was tachycardiac but sinus, without signs of ischemia.
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate.
He received an abdominal CT in the Emergency Room, which had no evidence for leak or intra-abdominal collection.
The following morning, he was taken to the operating room for diagnostic laparoscopy and to rule out ischemic bowel, leak, anastomotic ulcer, biliary colic, internal hernia or obstruction.
His laparoscopy was negative for any of the above.
Postoperatively, he spiked temperature to 102.6.
Routine laboratory studies were sent looking for the source of this fever, including blood cultures, urinalysis and culture.
He received a chest x-ray which was negative.
Therefore, it was decided to stop the heparin drip and get a stat head CT as this examination was concerning for bleed.
The head CT, however, was negative, without signs of edema or bleed.
It was noted, however, that his platelet count had fallen from his admission level of 186 down to 64, which presumptively diagnosed him wit heparin induced thrombocytopenia and his anticoagulation was switched to Loperidine with a goal PTT of 2 to 2.5 times normal.
He continued to be tachycardiac and, at times, with activities, his heart rate was up into the 140's.
His stool did eventually return as Clostridium difficile positive and he was started on p.o.
With a presumptive additional pulmonary embolus now on the left, in addition to the known right pulmonary embolus, an echo was obtained which showed a hypokinetic right ventricle.
All of these things maintained him overnight; however, his laboratory studies showed evidence for increasing renal and liver failure.
He also had an element of anticoagulation due to his liver failure.
The neurology consult requested a head CT which showed bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages, effacement of sulci and bilateral ventricles as well as oncho herniation.
EEG showed no background signals and a nuclear medicine study had no evidence of blood flow to the brain.
