On arrival to [**Location (un) **] ED, the patient was found to have a Dig level of 3.2, bradycardia to the 40s, hyperkalemia to 8.0, and ARF with Cr of 2.5 (baseline 0.8).
She was given Digibind, Atropine, D50, Insulin, and HCO3 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
On arrival to the ED, the patient's K was found to be decreased to 5.5, and her ECG did not demonstrate any changes consistent with hyperkalemia.
She had a Urinalysis that was positive for infection, so she was started on Cipro IV for a urinary tract infection and Flagyl IV for presumed CDiff.
She was also started on IV fluids at 100 cc/h, as she has a history of CHF with EF <35%.
She was transfered to the MICU, there the patient's VS were P 65, R 13, 94% on 3L, BP 92/67.

ECG Study Date of [**2114-7-28**]  11:10:02 PM   Sinus rhythm.
She was monitored on telemetry and seen by the toxicology service, and she had no significant arrhythmias.
The indication for her digoxin appears to be CHF and it is unclear whether she still needs the medication.
Her creatinine improved to 0.6 after IV fluids.
Cultures showed pan sensitive pseudomonas so she was kept on the ciprofloxacin.
C Diff was reportedly negative at her nursing home and was negative here.
# Pacemaker: It was also noted that the patient had a pacemaker but that there was no pacing spikes on her EKG with bradycardia.
They found that she has a [**Company 2267**] medical placed on [**2098-12-1**] model [**Telephone/Fax (3) 84747**].
She underwent ultrasound of the arm to rule out DVT and a thrombophlebitis was found in the basilic vein.
