Her daughter came over to visit and was concerned because the patient's symptoms of confusion were similar to the symptoms she had during her stroke in [**2095**].
In the ED initial vital signs were T 102.4 HR 138 BP 97/44 RR 20 SpO2 99% RA.
CXR was unremarkable.
CT neck showed an ill defined hypodensity, stranding and loss of fat planes in the right hypopharynx and deep spaces of the right neck extending to the carotid space with retropharyngeal fluid/edema.
Given the nonspecific swelling seen on CT neck, ENT was consulted.

CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-11**], there are continued bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis and pulmonary edema in a patient with cardiomegaly.
Cardiac Echo Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Indeterminate indices for diastolic function assessment.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-7-21**], the findings are similar.
She did not have any URI symptoms, and CXR did not suggest pneumonia.
Her blood pressure and urine output responded to fluid and pressor, which was gradually weaned off.
BP continued to be stable.
CT neck did not show abscess, and ENT was consulted.
Blood cultures remained negative.
Patient's creatinine rose to 1.2 on the day of admission with low urine output.
However, with aggressive IVF, urine output improved and creatinine returned to baseline.
Her initial INR in the ED was supratherapeutic, so a dose was held and later resumed given that no invasive procedure was planned for her retropharyngeal infection.
Her HR remained in the 80s-90s and SBP mostly in the 100-120s on diltiazem 60 mg TID alone.
An echocardiogram was ordered, which showed normal systolic function, but the study was not able to adequately assess diastolic function.
Given her initial confusional state was similar to prior CVA presentation, she received a CT head without contrast which did not show acute intracranial bleeding or swelling to suggest new stroke.
