He states that his weight this morning was 192 which is high for him and he states that he has been as low as 172.
Weights in our system are difficult to follow, and the patient has readings of many  He notes that he has had a normal bowel movement this morning and has never noticed red blood around stool, red blood in the toilet bowl, or black-tarry stools.
Rectal exam revealed bright red blood.
The patient briefly endorsed respiratory distress, and cxr was checked revealing a mild increase in interstitial edema and 160mg of IV lasix were given with 100cc of UOP and resolution of symptoms.

Recommend non-emergent chest CT to assess for other possible pulmonary nodules and establish frequency of surveillance.
TTE ([**2122-7-1**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the interventricular septum and anterior wall (LVEF= 20-25 %).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study dated [**2122-1-8**] (images reviewed), the degree of mitral regurgitation is slightly worse.
Renal ultrasound ([**2122-7-1**]): FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 9.8 cm and the left kidney measures 10.1 cm.

In addition, echocardiogram performed on HD1 was not consistent with cardiogenic shock.
Metoprolol and torsemide were restarted on HD4 as blood pressures were stable and patient began to appear volume overloaded with increased weight, fluid wave in abdomen, elevated JVP and lower extremity edema.
His weight was 189 lbs at the time of discharge.
#Right>Left heart failure- Patient's ongoing signs of lower extremity edema, abdominal distension and elevated JVP on exam indicating right>left sided failure.
On HD3, patient was taken for right heart catheterization to determine acute vasoreactivity to nitric oxide.
The right heart catherization showed elevated pulmonary pressures with good response to NO.
Urine sediment did not show signs of ATN.
Renal ultrasound showed no signs of hydronephrosis.
Creatinine began to trend downward.
# GI bleed - Patient with no obvious predilection to bleeding on upper and lower endoscopy in '[**20**].
He continued to have blood streaked stools intermittently, but hematocrit remained stable following initial transfuion.
Echocardiogram performed on HD1 showed higher pulmonary pressures and worse MR in comparison to prior TTE performed in [**2121-12-16**].
Patient was instructed to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if he had a weight gain of >3lbs.
At the time of discharge his PTT and INR were trending downward.
#IDDM: Patient's blood sugar was well controlled with insulin sliding scale throughout admission.
#Transitional Issues: - CT abd/pelvis revealed RLL 5mm pulmonary nodule.
Recommend non-emergent chest CT to assess for other possible pulmonary nodules and establish frequency of surveillance.

We were unable to do a colonoscopy to check the site of the bleeding so a colonoscopy will be scheduled in [**1-16**] weeks to check this.
Your blood counts have been stable and the bleeding seems to have stopped.
Your weight at discharge is 189 pounds.
Start taking protonix to prevent bleeding in your stomach  Followup Instructions: You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by the gastroenterology department to schedule a colonoscopy in about 3 weeks.
