In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.5 P 140 BP 162/116 R 28 O2 sat 80%.
Patient was in significant respiratory distress on presentation with oxygen saturations falling into the 70s.
Subsequent ABG revealed 7.25/60/323/28.
CXR was performed confirming placement of ET tube and existing PICC line.
CXR showed diffuse infiltrates.
Her blood pressures fell to systolic on 80s and IV boluses were started.
Labs were notable for WBC 27, HCT 30 (baseline), lactate 3.3, UA with trace protein and ketones, glucose 278, and Na 134.

CXR 1.
Bilateral patchy opacities, which may be due to patient motion versus infection versus edema.
Consider repeat chest radiograph if clinically warranted.
[**2150-10-16**] Echo The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the distal [**1-14**] of the ventricle.
[**2150-10-21**] Echo The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-10-16**], left ventricular systolic function has markedly improved.
[**2150-10-22**] CXR 1) Near total resolution of left effusion with mild residual pulmonary vascular congestion.
Her sputum grew out staph aureus and 2 strains of E. coli (see labs for details), so she was treated with antibiotics clindamycin and aztreonam for a total of 8 days completed on [**2150-10-23**] (D1 [**2150-10-15**]).
She was actively diuresed toward the end of her ICU stay and CXR showed improvement of her effusion.
There was concern of possible teeth abscess, but CT head was not able to capture and Panorex X ray was not possible given intubated status.
RIJ CVL was placed and PICC (placed prior to admission [**10-7**] at Shirrel House) line was removed.
Blood cx showed coag negative staph as well as enterococcus faecalis, suggesting PICC line infection although PICC tip was cultured negative.
Sputum grew out E. Coli and coag + staph aureus.
Antibiotics clindamycin and aztreonam were chosen based on sensitivity and she was treated for a total of 8 day course for HAP (D1, [**2150-10-15**]) and completed on [**10-23**].
Repeat CXR showed improvement of the bibasilar opacification, which could also be atelectasis.
Cardiac ischemia, likely from demand with active diuresis and recent sepsis.
This was noted on [**2150-10-23**] when telemetry monitoring revealed new T-wave inversion with troponin up to 0.14.
A discussion was held with patient's HCP regarding therapy for the demand ischemia, and a decision was made to hold off further monitoring and intervention given her significant comorbidities and that the risk likely outweighs the benefit of anticoagulation.
She received a total of 2 units of pRBC after discussion with her HCP, and her Hct responded appropriately.
However, CT scan was unable to characterize the abscess due to resolution and location of the abscess.
CT head did not show herniation or acute bleeding.
Also during your hospitalization there was a decrease in your heart function and some demand on your heart that caused us to feel that you had a heart attack.
