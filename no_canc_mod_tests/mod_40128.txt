GRAM STAIN (Final [**2185-3-2**]):  NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
Coronary Angiography  COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures, with RVEDP of 12 mm Hg and LVEDP of 32 mm Hg.
The mean PCWP was elevated at 24 mm Hg.
Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was elevated at 43 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressures were normal with aortic systolic pressure of 128 mm Hg.
Pulse pressure was widened at 73 mm Hg.
Cardiac index was depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2.
Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation.
Supravalvular aortography revealed 4+ aortic regurgitation.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The maximum gradient across the valve is 33 mm Hg with a mean gradient of 28 mm Hg.
[**2185-3-4**] 5:38 PM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter, NG tube and mediastinal drains.
The lung volumes are low on the current exam and this may contribute to a larger contour of the heart although close follow up is recommended to exclude the true cardiac enlargement which may be consistent with pericardial effusion.
