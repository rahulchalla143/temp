Ultrasound today, on the day of admission was unable to detect hepatic artery flow.
Angiography showed severe stenosis of the artery through which a small catheter was advanced beyond the narrowing and the artery was found to be clotted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient was afebrile, heart rate was 76, blood pressure 111/61.
The examination revealed a middle aged male alert, oriented in no distress.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart exam revealed regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal exam revealed abdomen which was soft, nontender, nondistended.
LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count 13.6, hematocrit 47.7, platelets were 126, prothrombin time was 11.1, PTT 30.6, INR is 0.9.
Fibrinogen was 171.
Sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 98, bicarbonate 24.
BUN 32, creatinine 1.1. glucose 145.
ALT 137, AST 106, alk phos 130.
Total bilirubin 1.1, direct bilirubin 1.4.
SK 506 level was 2.5.
Robimycin level was 14.3.
Angiography, global arteriogram demonstrated mild atherosclerotic disease of the renal abdominal aorta.
Selective celiac arteriogram demonstrated patent celiac access.
Hepatic arteriogram demonstrated partially occluded common hepatic arterial lumen with multiple filling defects most consistent with thrombus.
The was transfused four units on this day for hematocrit drop.
The ultrasound showed patent hepatic artery on this day.
Repeat ultrasound showed patent hepatic artery and the patient remained in the surgical Intensive Care Unit.
On hospital day seven, which is postop day three, the patient was transfused an additional two units of platelets for a platelet count of 77,000.
A CT scan was obtained which showed right hepatic artery flow with no flow on the left, with a question of a change in the left lobe suggestive of infarction.
The tips were sent for culture and central venous line was placed.
The platelet count was followed and had initially risen to above 100,000 but was now trending down and was actually 78,000 on this day.
Also of note this day the patient's Prograf was held secondary to a level of 15.6.
Ultrasound showed both of the right and left hepatic artery and the common duct was also evaluated and measured 2.5 mm.
An ultrasound was obtained which was negative for deep vein thrombosis.
On this day the patient was transfused two additional units of platelets for a platelet count of 63,000.
On postop day nine, a CT scan was repeated to evaluate the hepatic artery and again flow was seen both in the right and left hepatic arteries.
