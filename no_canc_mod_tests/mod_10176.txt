After arrival in the ED and receiving 40  mg IV Lasix and sublingual nitroglycerin times two, the patient became suddenly hypotensive with blood pressure 69/pulse, heart rate 71.
Cardiology consultation:  Echocardiogram revealed biventricular failure.
Swan catheter placed revealed cardiac index of 1.8 to 1.9; wedge pressure of 8 to 9 mmHg and elevated PA pressure of 70 to 80 systolic.
VQ scan was performed indicating the high probability of PE.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: Temperature 99.8, blood pressure 132/80, respiration rate 20, oxygen saturation 93% on two liters.
JVP approximately 5 to 6, no bruits.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with slight crackles at bases.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies revealed the following: On [**7-8**] CBC illustrated a WBC of 13.5, hematocrit 42.9, platelet count 185,000.
ALT 55, AST 47, alkaline phosphatase 104.
Chest x-ray:  [**7-5**], no evidence of failure or pneumonia.
Echocardiogram:  PA pressure 70, EF 35%, severe LV/RV hypokinesis.
EKG: [**2157-7-6**]:  Sinus rhythm at 84, normal axis, LVH with 4 mm to [**Street Address(2) 1755**] depression laterally.
On [**2157-7-7**] EKG sinus rhythm at 78, normal axis, LVH with less marked ST depression.
PT 14.3, PTT 53.8, INR 1.4, CK times 3 negative.
Blood culture/urine culture negative.
The patient's oxygen saturations gradually improved to about 95% to 96% on two liters with slight desaturation on room air to approximately 94%.
until a therapeutic INR was reached.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has biventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram associated with acute PE.
The patient's CHF was well controlled with cardiac regimen of Digoxin, Captopril, Coreg, and Lasix.
The patient was monitored on telemetry for episodes of PVCs and short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
It was decided that further workup of LV dysfunction in the form of repeat echocardiogram and/or catheterization would be more accurate after improvement in RV function.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed large amounts of sludge within the gallbladder without evidence of cholecystitis, and normal appearance of the liver.
Urine culture and blood culture were negative.
chest pain; maximum of 3, then medical doctor.
At this time, the patient will have his INR rechecked and evaluate for continuation of Coumadin therapy.
