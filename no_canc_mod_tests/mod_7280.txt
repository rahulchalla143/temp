I would suggest a repeat CT scan, after vigorous coughing to clear the trachea of any debris, utilizing oral contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] to reassess both the trachea and the esophagus.
- EGD [**2116-5-1**] Procedure: 	The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
A physical exam was performed.
# Acute kidney injury: The patient normally has a creatinine around 1.8 s/p living related transplant, but after being found down had a creatinine of 3, which rose during the course of his admission initally; he was thought to have ATN secondary to volume depletion in setting or recent bowel prep as well as dehydration.
His creatinine improved over the course of his admission with IV fluids back down to 3, but not completely back to his baseline.
# GI bleed: Pt guaiac positive in ED likely related to recent colonoscopy or prior rectal exam at OSH.
Concern for UGI bleed given report of dark emesis, but pt HCT is stable, GI lavage is neg and he denies abdominal pain, bloody stool, black stool or lightheadedness.
The patient had a table HCT within the hospital that did not require any blood transfusions.
An endoscopy was performed which was completely normal, without any sign of mass or bleed.
#Multivocal infiltrate: Multifocal infiltrate found on CXR after being altered and vomiting with EMS.
A CT of the Chest was shown to be consistent with multifocal pneumonia, but also incidentally commented on an esophgeal/tracheal mass.
UPon discharge he was not short of breath and satting well on room air, as compared to his initial presentation when he had required 4 L O2.
#Esophageal mass: On CT scan, the patient was noted to have an esophageal mass with some possible connection to a very small tracheal infiltrate, concerning for malignancy.
A barium swallow was performed, which only showed some esophageal dysmotility, but no signs of a mass or fistula.
The patient's tacrolimus level was elevated in the hospital, and thus his dose was halved to 1.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] from 3 mg [**Hospital1 **], with Tacro levels on discharge in the appropriate range.
