Non-contrast head CT: There is a moderate-sized right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 2.8 cm in greatest dimension.
Evaluation for an underlying mass lesion could better be obtained with MRI.
Repeat NCHCT [**11-20**]:  no significant change, official read is pending  Brief Hospital Course: She was admitted to the neurology ICU for observation overnight.
The etiology of the bleed was thought to be most likely traumatic, but given the location, her age, history of dementia, and recent unsteadiness, she was ordered for an MRI to rule out underlying mass or amyloid angiopathy.
The MRI was subsequently cancelled after a discussion with the family given that the results would not change management.
A repeat head CT was performed 48 hours after the event and was stable.
