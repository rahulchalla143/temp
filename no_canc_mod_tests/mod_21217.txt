He was treated with nitroglycerin, aspirin, Lovenox, and he did rule in for a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction with CK of 1348, MB 171, and a troponin greater than 50.
He had cardiac catheterization when he came in to the hospital, where he was transferred in to [**Hospital1 18**].
The cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 25% by echocardiogram and severe three vessel disease by cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization revealed a 95% lesion of the right coronary, totally occluded LAD, and totally occluded OM-2 with the circumflex.
Ejection fraction on echocardiogram was 25-30%.
He had normal cardiac sounds of S1, S2, which were regular rate and rhythm.
His abdominal examination was benign.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  Sodium 140, K 3.8, chloride 111, bicarb 23, BUN 11, creatinine 0.8 with a blood sugar of 100, INR of 1.1.
White count 9.0, hematocrit 39.1, platelet count of 182,000.
He had preoperative carotid studies done which showed no significant stenosis in either left or right carotid arteries.
Was in sinus rhythm in the 70s with blood pressure of 97/53, satting 94% on 5 liters nasal cannula.
Postoperatively, his white count was 31, hematocrit 31, K 4.5, BUN 10, creatinine 0.8.
His examination was otherwise unremarkable.
He was hemodynamically stable with a white count of 8.3, and a hematocrit of 27.2.
He remained in sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions and continued to maintain a good blood pressure of 121/58 with unremarkable laboratories.
Hematocrit rose slightly to 31.6 with a creatinine of 0.9.
He was monitored very closely for his oxygen saturations with exertion.
His final chest x-ray showed resolution of his CHF and good aeration, but slight left basilar atelectasis.
