NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a large right frontal, parietal, and temporal subdural hematoma with mixed acute and chronic components that has decreased in size and now measures approximately 1 cm from the skull base.
Multiple air-fluid levels in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses with near complete opacifications of air cells may represent sinusitis, although not significantly changed from prior exam.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  FINDINGS: There is a large right frontal, parietal and temporal subdural hematoma with mixed acute and chronic components causing extensive effacement of the adjacent sulci, severe subfalcine herniation of approximately 17 mm, and mild uncal herniation causing mass effect on the brainstem and effacement of the ambient cistern.
There are air-fluid levels noted within the right and left maxillary sinus and right sphenoid sinus with near-complete opacification of the majority of the anterior middle ethmoid air cells.
