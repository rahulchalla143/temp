Admission Date:                   Discharge Date: [**2161-7-19**]   Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   The patient is an 82 year old female with a recent admission to [**Hospital6 1597**] for a GI bleed.
At [**Hospital3 **] the patient underwent CT scanning.
A plain film was performed.
The patient underwent a CT scan with no contrast in an attempt to find a leak.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was taken directly to the operating room, where an exploratory laparotomy was performed revealing ischemic colon.
She was also placed on Lopressor and her cardiac enzymes were cycled secondary to concern about a cardiac event from labs at the outside hospital.
The patient showed postoperative oliguria, which required bolusing to keep her urine output adequate.
On that day, the patient received an echocardiogram, which revealed a 60 percent ejection fraction, and slight right ventricular hypokinesis.
The patient was, however, closely watched for acute changes and frequently blood gases were drawn as the patient suffered from CREST syndrome, which made monitoring by pulse oximetry difficult.
It was decided secondary to evaluating a chest x-ray that the patient was probably in mild pulmonary edema.
She became acutely hypotensive with a very low heart rate, which on EKG appeared to be a junctional rhythm.
The patient had a chest x-ray to confirm endotracheal tube placement, as well as to evaluate pulmonary edema.
Cardiology was called and echocardiogram was performed at the bedside showing global left ventricular dysfunction and ejection fraction of 20 percent, right ventricular hypokinesis, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation.
The patient was given 2 liters of normal saline, as well, to try and increase her blood pressure.
Cor pulmonale was also ruled out on echocardiogram, indicating that a large PE was probably not to blame for the patient's problems.
