Head CT: This examination is slightly limited by patient motion.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
MS changes: Given pt's waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, a head CT was done and ruled out bleed and urine and blood tox labs were sent and all returned negative.
TSH, B12 and Folate were also all within normal limits.
His bronchitis was trated with a 5-day course of azithromycin.
Serial ABGs showed a persistently high pCO2 in the 70s while the pt remained asx.
An echocardiogram during admission showed severely depressed systolic function with an EF of 20%.
CAD: Given his NSVT, cardiac enzymes were checked to rule out coronary causes.
ARF: On admission, creatinine elevated to 1.9 likely secondary to hypovolemia.
A FeUrea was consistent with a pre-renal picture so pt was given gentle IVF.
As his volume status improved, his creatinine returned to his baseline of 1.0 .
