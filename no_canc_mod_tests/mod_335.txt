The patient was consented for an exploratory laparotomy that evening for evidence of small bowel obstruction.
The patient developed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate into the 150-160s and decreasing blood pressure on the morning of POD #1.
Cardioversion was attempted with reversion back into atrial fibrillation, so a neosynephrine drip was started to increase the blood pressure and a diltiazem drip was started.
The pulse decreased to the 120s at that time.
The patient was started on IV antibiotics - Vancomycin, Zosyn and Fluconazole for gram positive cocci, gram negative rods  and gram positive rods in her sputum and from her wound.
The patient received a 2D echo on [**2121-6-2**] which revealed an ejection fraction > 60%, mild left atrial enlargement, biventricular function, normal wall thickness, 1+ mitral regurgitation and normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressures.
On [**2121-6-4**] a chest xray showed bilateral pleural effusions with the left greater than the right in size.
On [**2121-6-5**], the patient had a bout of hypoxemia requiring a bronchoscopy - the attending noted that the patient had a bilateral pneumonia with upper zone predominance indicative of ventilator associated pneumonia.
Her chest CT from the same date showed large multifocal consolidation bilaterally, no abcesses and moderate pleural effusions.
A bronchoscopy on that date showed no endobronchial lesion, minimal airway erythema and secretions bilaterally.
On [**2121-6-8**], the patient had a CT scan which revealed a perihepatic fluid collection which was drained by IR on [**2121-6-9**], the fluid was found to be blood and air, no abscess.
On [**2121-6-11**] the patient's heart rate and blood pressure increased acutely with a drop in oxygen saturations.
A torso CT scan was ordered this same day which revealed worsening left lung infiltrates involving the entire lung, no signs of effusion, some residual free air over the liver but no evidence of fluid, abscess or a contrast leak.
On [**2121-6-13**], a stool culture was sent due to large loose bowel movements and was found to be positive for C. difficile.
A repeat chest CT on [**2121-6-18**] shows worsening lung consolidation and increased free air above the liver.
There are no intraabdominal fluid collections or abscesses and the jejunostomy site has no air or fluid in the area surrounding it.
A repeat exploratory laparotomy was attempted on this date but was unsuccessful due to her loops of small bowel being adherent to the peritoneal wall along the length of the midline incision.
A culture of the peritoneal fluid was sent at that time which grew [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
The patient had decreased oxygen saturations when an attempt was made to do a CT guided drainage of the patient's new air/fluid level in left hemithorax suspicious for an empyema.
Approximately 450cc of serosanguinous fluid was drained and sent for analysis and culture which grew propionobacterium acnes.
A chest xray showed resolution of a moderate pleural effusion.
Dermatology was consulted and performed a skin biopsy on the lesions which appear to be a result of a drug hypersensitvity.
The fluid sent from this drainage grew sparse [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
A chest xray from [**6-27**] shows diffuse alveolar opacities.
Chest xray on [**2121-6-29**] shows decreased bilateral opacification.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] received an echocardiogram on [**6-30**] shows a dilated right ventricle and free wall hypokinesis.
On [**2121-7-2**], an attempt to get a CT scan resulted in an episode of hypotension and increased ventilatory support.
The CT scan showed worsening bilateral airspace disease and no drainable fluid collection in the abdomen.
