CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2133-4-2**] FINDINGS: The study is limited by patient motion.
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to motion.
Please note for the detection of acute brain ischemia, MRI with diffusion weighting is more sensitive than CT.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2133-4-4**] New areas of confluent opacification have developed in the perihilar and basilar regions, and may be due to the provided history of acute aspiration, but a component of pulmonary edema from fluid overload is likely, and there are also bilateral scattered septal lines in the lung periphery.
