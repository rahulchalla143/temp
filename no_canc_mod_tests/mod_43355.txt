INR of 3.4.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of less than 15%.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2109-11-1**] shows left circumflex occluded after the first obtuse marginal one which was patent.
Left anterior descending and right coronary artery with mild luminal irregularities, mean right atrial pressure of 12, right ventricular end diastolic pressure of 22, pulmonary artery pressure 54/30; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 28; cardiac index 1.7.
Echocardiogram on [**2109-5-6**] shows left ventricle severely dilated, severe left ventricular global hypokinesis, ejection fraction less than 15%.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  No icterus, no pallor.
LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit of 34.5; BUN 2.0; creatinine 1.2; Digoxin 0.7.
INR of 3.4.
His Coumadin was held and he was administered Vitamin K to reverse his INR in anticipation of interventional procedures.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] first underwent a non invasive physiologic study, NIPS, which showed his devices to be functional; however, this study did show possible occlusion of the superior vena cava and subclavian venous vasculature.
Follow-up ultrasounds of bilateral upper extremities revealed that the bilateral internal jugular, subclavian and axillary veins were patent but there was sluggish flow on the left side.
Apex upon transfer back to C-Med, the patient's hematocrit was 24 and he was transfused with four units of packed red blood cells with the goal of bringing his hematocrit over 30.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4946**] systolic blood pressure ran an average between 80 and 100 throughout the hospitalization and his Carvedilol and Lisinopril were frequently held for this reason.
Near the end of his hospital course, the Carvedilol was discontinued and the patient was kept on Lisinopril, given his persistent low blood pressure and the fact that he will not be able to monitor his blood pressure at home while taking his medications.
Follow-up x-ray prior to discharge of the patient's left apical pneumothorax revealed no change.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of less than 15%.
