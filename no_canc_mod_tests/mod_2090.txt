In the Emergency Department, his blood pressure was 63/48, pulse 82, 16 respirations, 98% on room air but no temperature recorded.
He states that he has never had a colonoscopy and his blood pressure usually runs in the systolic of 80.
Anemia with a baseline hematocrit of 30%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.8, pulse 86, blood pressure 72/50, respirations 15, 100% on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The pulses were 2+ equally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 4.9, hematocrit 31.4, platelets 41,000.
His chemistry panel was notable for a BUN of 59 and a creatinine of 4.2.
His initial coagulations were a PT of 14.8, INR 1.4, PTT 29.8.
It is unlikely that it is from esophageal variceal bleeding, although to rule out that possibility the patient had an EGD which demonstrated stigmata of old varices with no active bleeding.
For the purposes of ultimate treatment of the rectal varices and hemorrhoids, the Hepatology Service recommended no current intervention as far as hemorrhoidectomy is concerned and that banding would probably just cause infection as the hemorrhoids sloughed off and that the definitive treatment would come via liver transplantation or portal systemic shunting.
For this, the patient will be referred back to the [**Hospital3 2358**] for further management.
No diagnostic tests were done off this since it was done for therapeutic reasons and not for a diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
