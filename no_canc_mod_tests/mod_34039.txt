presented on this admition with increased lethargy, a CT scan revealed increase in the size of the ventricles and developing hydrocephalus.
Patient was admitted from [**Date range (1) 80447**] after falling off ladder.

[**12-30**]: EKG Sinus rhythm.
MRI [**1-6**] Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
Evaluation for subtle foci of restricted diffusion is somewhat limited due to the presence of blood products in the parenchyma as well as in the occipital horns.
Subdural fluid collection in the right frontoparietal and surgical resection cavity filled with fluid in the right middle cranial fossa, with edema of the cerebral parenchyma and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and 8 mm shift of the midline structures to the left, not significantly changed compared to the prior study of [**2161-1-3**], allowing for the technical differences.
HCT [**1-17**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI [**1-18**] Head: No evidence for acute hemorrhage in the pons as questioned on the recent CT.
Slight increase in size of the subgaleal collection on the right compared to previous examination from [**1-7**], but no significant change compared to yesterday's CT.
HCT [**1-20**]:IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI Head [**1-22**]: No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
[**1-2**], it was noted on physical exam that pt.
had significant Nuchal rigidity, an LP was performed and later and ID was consulted.
Cultures from CSF have to date, not grown any organism, and WBC thought to be pilocytic in nature.
On [**1-2**], swabs from the bone flap grew the organism p. acne, and appropriate antibiotics were started(Cefepime for two weeks and Vancomycin 4wks).
On [**1-6**], routine LENIS were performed and massive bilateral DVT's were identified.
He was started on heparin infusion until INR could be therapeutic.
[**1-13**] Upper extremity ultrasound performed to identify superficial thrombosis in R basilic/cephalic veins.
Warfarin therapy was deferred until [**1-14**] in the setting of pending systemic cultures to determine if in fact bone flap was infected, and may necessitate removal.
His WBC was 6.3 on [**1-25**], and thereby not suggestive of ongoing infectious process.
He was discharged to an appropriate facility on [**1-27**] where his warfarin transition is to continue(Goal INR 2.5-3)  Medications on Admission: 1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed).
Hydralizine 50mg Q6 Hydroclorothiazide 25mg 4.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Month/Year (2) **]: Ten (10) ML's PO BID (2 times a day).
Heparin (Porcine) in D5W 25,000 unit/250 mL Parenteral Solution [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 1200 (1200) units/hr Intravenous ASDIR (AS DIRECTED): Please titrate to goal PTT 50-70 until INR is Therapeutic.
Please check INR in am.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
