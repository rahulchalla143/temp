Relevant labs include K 5.9, trop 0.016, creat normal, Hct 37, and plt 47.
Was worked up in spring [**2181**] w/ CXR, which showed R sided infiltrates (CT recommended for f/u--not yet done), stress echo, which was positive (see report below), and cardiac cath, which showed 3VD.
R colectomy for diffuse polyposis and high grade dysplasia [**2178**]; colonoscopy [**2179**] revealed diverticulosis but otherwise nl  2.

WBC 5.4 --> 0.9 .
CXR [**3-6**]: Radiographic evidence of fibrotic lung disease associated with traction bronchiectasis, bibasilar  honeycombing and pleural fibrosis, right more than left.
These findings necessitate further evaluation by a chest CT, preferably a high-resolution chest CT scan examination if the patient can tolerate the procedure, or if not, then a standard chest CT scan examination.
CXR [**3-7**]: Comparison with [**2182-3-6**].
The extensive pleural thickening, bronchiectasis, and severe volume loss in the upper lobes is unchanged.
EKG showed sinus bradycardia that over the course of several hours trended to HR in 60s with 2 brief episodes of bradycardia to 30s-40s with bowel movements, resolved before intervention made.
He initially had a SBP in low 100s, and was given 1L IVFs over several hours.
On the morning after admission, the patient had a decrease in BP from SBPs in 90s, 100s to 60s-70s.
