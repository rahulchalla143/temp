During this hospital course, she also developed other complications including ARF with a creatinine that peaked at 2.9, now recovered.
She also had diarrhea and was treated with Flagyl although multiple cultures have been cdiff negative.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**1-/2180**] EF 35-40% The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with global hypokinesis (basal to mid lateral wall moves best) and distal LV/apical akinesis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-8-21**], the overall LVEF appears slightly lower.
CARDIAC CATH: [**12/2179**]: 1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed diffuse 3-vessel disease.
Graft angiography revealed an occluded SVG-D1 (previously stented).
Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated LVEDP of 25mmHg.
Cardiac index was low normal at 2.3l/min/m2.
She underwent cardiac catheterization on the second hospital day with balloon angioplasty to a stenosis in the distal LAD and placement of a DES in the SVG-PDA graft.
The patient was previously known to have a depressed LVEF; repeat echo during this admission showed an EF of approximately 25%.
Based on her EF assessment, the patient is likely a candidate for ICD implant in the future.
Peak Cr at [**Hospital1 18**] was 2.2. .
Repeat cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] were negative and the patient did not have evidence of recurrent infection.
Radiology advised a repeat CXR to evaluate for resolution of PNA as an outpt.
Her cultures growing only yeast.
# Diarrhea: The patient was treated with flagyl at OSH even though C. Diff studies were negative.
An A1c was checked and found to be elevated.

YOUR CHEST X-RAY SHOWED A PNEUMONIA DURING YOU ADMISSION.
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU HAVE A REPEAT X-RAY IN SIX WEEKS TO BE CERTAIN THE PNEUMONIA HAS COMPLETELY RESOLVED.
