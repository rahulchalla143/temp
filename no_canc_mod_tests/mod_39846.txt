CT Torso showed small bowel which has herniated through the diaphgragmatic hiatus adjacent to the gastric pull-up.
Urine culture was negative therefore Linezolid was stopped on [**2119-10-8**].
Pt's white count and fever curve improved over the next week and a half, and his antibiotic regimen was then stopped on [**10-17**].
Weaned to CPAP 8/5 with oxygen saturations of 98%, eventually progressed to tolerating only Trach piece by [**10-24**].
Bronchoscopy yielded only minimal thin secretions, pt required CMV for adequate oxygenation.
An abdominal CT scan showed herniation of the transverse colon and part of the pancreas into the thoracic cavity.
After hernia repair and [**State **] patch placement, the patient continued to have copious bilious drainage from the NGT placed in the gastric conduit and intolerance of NGT clamping.
A SBFT study was obtained on [**10-27**] which showed no contrast movement through the pylorus.
His NGT output decreased over the next 3 days, and his NGT was eventually removed.
It was concluded that the [**State 19827**] Patch was no longer able to preserve the patient's abdominal domain, and it was exchanged for a wound vac.
The wound vac was changed every 3 days following it's initial placement with no issues.
