She was then changed to Vanco/Meropenem given her ESBL urine cx results.
Her change in mental status was attributed to her infection and after treatment for her VAP and UTI her mental status returned to baseline.
The patient was restarted on her metoprolol at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], but several doses were held secondary to hypotension and bradycardia.

#Anemia: The patient admission Hct was 26 and slowly trended down to Hct 21.
Her hemolysis labs were negative and there were no signs of active bleeding.
She was trnasfused one unit [**1-18**] and her Hct remained stable.
Upon discharge her Hct was 25.7.
Upon discharge her coumadin was increased to 5mg daily and continued on lovenox 60mg [**Hospital1 **] until INR >2.0.
Warfarin 3 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime: goal INR for afib [**1-25**].
