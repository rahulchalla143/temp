He was recently seen in pulmonology clinic on [**2189-8-5**] and had his steroids reduced from 10mg daily to 5mg daily in the setting of higher doses before this.
Subsequently his saturation dropped to 94% on RA and he was placed on 2LNC.
For the low blood pressure he was broadened to vancomycin 1gm IV ONCE.
His pressures rose to 92/50 with his last vitals 99.3 61 18 99%2L.

Compared to his last testing two and a half weeks ago there is a marked decline in both his forced vital capacity (about 400 mL) and a drop in his FEV1 by about 400 mL as well  2) Idiopathic DCM, chronic LBBB, sp ICD implantation for primary   3) Hypothyroidism  4) Bilateral TKR  5) T12 compression fracture in [**2188-3-3**]  6) Right peroneal nerve injury [**2189**],now improving  7) CKD .

gout, kidney disease, chronic pneumonitis (?amio toxicity), dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of 20-25% and ICD placement for primary prevention and chronic pneumonitis presenting with bilateral foot pain and falls for 3 weeks with hypotension, [**Last Name (un) **], leukocytosis, worsening intestitial infiltrates.
Cardiogenic shock due to CHF exacerbation/MI was also considered but EKG and physical exam ___and echo?___ made this less likely.
CXR showing increased interstitial infiltrate density in setting of steroid-induced immunosuppression made atypical PNA a concern, and numerous studies for legionalla,PCP,[**Name10 (NameIs) 3019**],beta galactoman,glucan were all negative.
Given increasing density of interstitial infiltrates on CXR and dyspnea, would be concerned about a an atypical pulmonary infection, although patient arrived with normal rest saturations.
On Day #2 he was transferred from MICU to floors where he received prednisone PO and remained afebrile with stable VS. Cortisol stim test and random cortisol both were elevated but this is because pt was being treated with steroids during test.
There was also concern for septic arthritis given fever, white count etc so pt was initially started on broad spectrum abx but synovial fluid cx were negative.
Sample was too small to send for light microscopy so crystal study could not be performed.
#) Dilated cardiomyopathy: Echo on hosp day #3 (done to R/O CHF as etiology of hypotension) showed no progression of CHF (severe systolic, EF 20-25%).
