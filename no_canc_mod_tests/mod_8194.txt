The evaluation of the lung parenchima demonstrate multiple rounded opacities, in the right apex, 7:25, in right upper lobe, 7:33, 7:36, extensive areas of centrilobular ground-glass opacities and more rounded consolidations in right middle lobe and right lower lobe as well as in the left lung to a lesser extent, findings which are consistent with widespread infection/aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent flexible bronchoscopy to evaluate stent placement and airway.
She remained stable and on POD#3 was taken for a flexible bronchoscopy to further evaluate her airway.
On [**2196-2-18**] she was taken back to the operating room for flexible and rigid bronchoscopy with silicone stent placement.
On [**2-22**] she found to have right upper arm edema and a right upper extremity ultrasound was positive for a partially occlusive thrombi within the right internal jugular and right axillary vein.
Given her history of past DVTs a lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.
On [**2-24**] bilateral breast ultrasound revealed a small left-sided fluid collection which was drained for 1.5 cc of serous fluid.
Cultures were sent and results are pending.
