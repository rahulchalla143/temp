He sustained a motor vehicle accident on [**2118-12-31**], which resulted in a right hemothorax sternal fracture and was complicated by acute decompensation of his hepatic function which required an admission to the [**Hospital1 69**] with hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice with a rise in his total bilirubin count from 3.9 to 5.7, and acute renal failure with a creatinine rise from 0.5 to 2.1.
Physical examination and further workup suggested a possible aspiration pneumonitis involving the right upper and middle lobe.
On [**2-23**], he underwent left thoracocentesis with 1 liter of bloody fluid aspirated from the left pleural cavity.
He underwent a therapeutic bronchoscopy on [**1-31**], at which time purulent secretions with plugging of the right main stem and bronchus intermedius were noted.
Following the bronchoscopy, a repeat chest x-ray revealed opening up of the right upper lobe.
His fever was worked up with pan cultures, and he was started on acyclovir, and central lines were changed and tips sent for cultures.
His blood and sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and he received double coverage with Zosyn and ciprofloxacin.
However, by postoperative day seven, his cultures and sensitivities results suggested that the pseudomonas was resistant to these medications, and he was changed to meropenem.
His ALT was 111, up from 312 on postoperative day five, and his alkaline phosphatase was 199, up from 77.
His total bilirubin was 9, up from 7.7 on postoperative day five.
He also underwent an ultrasound-guided liver biopsy on postoperative day eight, and the biopsy suggested preservation injury with some elements of infection.
Mr. [**Known lastname 27608**] white count had decreased after the first few postoperative days, and based on that his CellCept dose had been reduced from 1 g b.i.d.
There was a suggestion of extravasation of contrast at the point of entry of the T-tube into the bile duct.
To better delineate the extent of extravasation, he underwent an ultrasound of the liver which did not show any biloma, and it in fact showed normal architecture of the bile duct and patent vessels with normal flow through them.
In view of his persistent depressed mental status, he underwent a head CT to rule out any intracranial infarct, and the head CT was negative for hemorrhage or infarct but possible Central Pontine Myelinolysis could not be ruled out.
Based on sensitivity results, gentamicin was changed to tobramycin, and the vancomycin which he received for a few days was discontinued.
By this stage (that is, going into the end of the second week and going into the third week) postoperatively, his liver function tests had plateaued out and then remained persistently elevated.
ALT was 108, and alkaline phosphatase was 426.
His total bilirubin at this stage was 9.1.
Repeat bronchoalveolar fluid cultures grew Pseudomonas aerogenesis.
His mental status changes issues were revisited, and he underwent an MRI of his head which showed some high density signals in the pontine and extra pontine area, the significance of which was unclear.
He also developed some smelly stools, and Clostridium difficile cultures were sent off for the stools which came back negative.
He had another therapeutic bronchoscopy at that time which showed that the secretions had lessened.
By this stage, he had completed his course of Zosyn and tobramycin and subsequent surveillance blood cultures were all negative.
His neurologic examination was stable.
The biopsy did not show any evidence of rejection.
A Doppler ultrasound of the liver done at the time also revealed patent vessels with good flow, and no evidence of biliary duct obstruction.
His immunosuppression at this stage was prednisone 20 mg once a day, rapamycin 5 mg once a day, Prograf 6 mg twice a day.
From a cardiovascular standpoint, he had been on Lopressor for several weeks to manage his tachycardia and had been stable.
From a renal perspective, his renal function had been stable for a while with BUN and creatinine of 35 and 0.8 on [**2119-3-29**].
His urine output was about 30 cc to 40 cc an hour for the past few days.
From a hematologic standpoint, his hematocrit had been slowly drifting down with a hematocrit of 24.6.
