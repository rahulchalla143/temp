In the ED, the patient's vital signs were: T 95.5, HR 90, BP 158/98, RR 16, O2Sat 99/RA.
The patient underwent a CT of the head and chest x-ray.
The CXR showed chronic LLL consolidation, RLL consolidation that had been noted on the previous admission and has not yet resolved, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions.
The CT of the head showed no acute intracranial pathology.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to be hyperkalemic and to have an INR of 1.3.
She says that his blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation have all been normal over the last several days.
He was initially treated with Levo/Flagyl, changed to Cefepime and Tobramycin and Flagyl when his cultures grew out Enterobacteriae; subsequently this was changed to Meropenem as it was felt that he may have an ESBL organism.
His pressure was in the 90s at this heart rate.
His finger sticks were normal.
His last nodal agents was 9pm on [**2168-9-18**] (he is on metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]) and his last sedatives were olanzapine at 10am on [**2168-9-18**] and trazodone at 9pm on [**2168-9-18**].
On the floor, he was given atropine x 2 and his heart rate increased to 60s after 1st atropine and his BP increased to the 110s.
CT of head showed ?stroke, but Neuro consulted and felt not c/w pt presentation.
He was started on dopamine; as his HR and BP picked up so did his mentation.
Neuro was consulted about a finding of possible stroke on CT which they felt was not clinically consistent with his physical exam.
His vitals signs were stable and mental status improved and he was called out to floor.

[**2168-9-12**] 12:30 pm BLOOD CULTURE; ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.
IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # [**Numeric Identifier 32727**] [**2168-9-12**].
Final bld cultures on [**10-30**] and [**9-18**] are negative.
He was started on dopamine; as his HR and BP picked up so did his mentation.
Neuro was consulted about a finding of possible stroke on CT which they felt was not clinically consistent with his physical exam.
# Bacteremia-MRSA and Enterobacter: Positive cultures on [**9-12**] and [**9-15**] with ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE sensitive to meropenum.
# CXR with bilateral consolidations/pleural effusions: CXR shows worsening pleural effusions and he has a persistant oxygen requirement.
His INR was reversed with 10 vit K for this procedure.
He was monitored on telemetry.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Goal INR = 2.0 to 3.0.
# Mass in R Atrium:  We spoke with echo [**Location (un) 1131**] room who read it as a ra "lump".
Retic count of 2.9 (RI = 2.9*(27.2/45)/2.0 = 0.88 or less than 2% and thus hypoproliferation).
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: 10ml  PO BID (2 times a day).
