PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 86, temperature 95, BP 126/70, respirations 20, 99%.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CT was same as pelvis x-ray findings.
X-ray showed right superior and inferior pubic ramus fracture with widening of pelvis, likely fracture of right sacrum versus S1.
The patient had an exploratory laparotomy performed by General Surgery.
The vital signs were stable postoperatively, neurovascularly intact, DP 2+ bilaterally.
They wanted to continue the Foley until the cystogram was done and to follow-up in the [**Hospital 159**] Clinic after examination was noted.
On [**2135-3-25**], the patient had a left knee CT done to rule out any ligamentous damage or dislocation secondary to some swelling and effusion in the left knee when working with physical therapy.
The CT results showed no fracture or dislocations.
MRI would be more effective but secondary to the patient having an EX fix in place, was not able to receive an MRI.
ADDENDUM:  On [**2135-3-28**], the patient had a cystogram performed to evaluate the bladder rupture repair.
