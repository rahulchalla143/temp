MRI 10/706: There are bilateral mixed signal intensities with predominant hyperintense T1 signal subdural hematomas identified extending from frontal to the parietal region.
HCT [**2131-11-19**]: The patient is status post bilateral parietal craniotomies.
The bilateral subdural collections are greatly decreased in size from [**2131-11-16**] and no longer demonstrate a heterogeneous pattern.
EKG [**11-21**]: Normal sinus rhythm.
ECG is within normal limits and unchanged compared to the previous tracing of [**2131-11-18**].
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 83 170 92 358/397.71 76 60 54  CXR [**11-16**]: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
The CT an MRI showed bilateral acute on chronic and subacute subdural hematomas with multiple membranes in between them and mass effect.
His post-operative exam was stable.
He had frequent neuro checks and his blood pressure was closely controlled.
In the ICU, he had one episode of left pupil dilatation, but his HCT at the time remained stable and the dilatation resolved spontaneously.
Hospital course was otherwise notable for chest pain, with a normal EKG and negative cardiac enzymes, and an asymptomatic positive blood culture (GPC, [**2-12**]) thought to be a contaminant.
