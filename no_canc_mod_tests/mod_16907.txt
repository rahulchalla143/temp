Her pain began to worsen over the holidays causing her to visit her primary care physician on [**12-28**] following an episode of substernal chest pain, which lasted ten minutes and was also relieved by two sublingual nitroglycerins at that time.
Her primary care physician referred her to [**Hospital3 **] where she ruled out for an myocardial infarction and had a stress test that was positive.
Following positive stress test the patient was referred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
Catheterization was performed on [**12-29**] and revealed left main and three vessel disease.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 9.3, hematocrit 32.1, platelets 194, sodium 139, potassium 3.4, chloride 105, CO2 25, BUN 25, creatinine 1.2, glucose 119, ALT 26, AST 34, alkaline phosphatase 73, amylase 73, total bilirubin 0.3 and albumin is 3.3.
Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Pulses carotid 2+ bilaterally, radial 2+ bilaterally, femoral 2+ on the left, right has an indwelling catheter, dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse both 2+ bilaterally.
During that time she had a neurology consult and echocardiogram to assess her left ventricular function and carotid duplex showed a 40 to 59% stenoses bilaterally.
Cardiac echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater then 55%, mild to moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
The MRI showed no evidence of acute infarct with mild to moderate changes of brain atrophy and medial temporal atrophy.
Following this preoperative workup the patient was brought to the Operating Room where she underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three.
Her bypass time was 95 minutes and her cross clamp time was 69 minutes.
She was weaned from the ventilator, however, showed a mild respiratory acidosis and was therefore kept intubated.
Her chest tubes were also removed, but she was kept in the Intensive Care Unit, because of her atrial fibrillation and poor urine output requiring a renal consultation.
At the time of this dictation the patient's physical examination is vital signs temperature 97.3, heart rate 60 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 137/40, respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 96% on room air.
Weight preoperatively 65 kilos.
Laboratory data white blood cell count 9.5, hematocrit 26.9, platelets 270, sodium 137, potassium 4.5, chloride 100, CO2 30, BUN 27, creatinine 1.5, glucose 108, PT 17.2, PTT 60.2, INR 2.0.
Respirations clear to auscultation bilaterally.
titrate Coumadin dose to keep INR 1.5 to 2.0.
