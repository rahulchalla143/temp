LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The mean gradient through the valve is 4 mm Hg with a maximum gradient of 8 mm Hg with a cardiac output of about 4 liters/minute.
His CXR showed resolving pulmonary contusions with small effusions and no evidence of CHF.
A preoperative echo had demonstrated an LVEF of ~50%.
