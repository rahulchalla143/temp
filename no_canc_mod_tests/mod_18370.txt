Cardiac enzymes were also drawn and patient was called to present to ED after these returned elevated (per report 1.5, unclear if Tn T or I).
In the ED, VS 97.1, Bp 140/84, HR 108, RR24.
Past Medical History: - MI in [**2103**] c/b ventricular aneurysm - CABG: in [**2116-10-31**] x4 LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1, SVG to OM2, SVG to RCA, LCx endarterectomy - s/p left ventricular aneurysm repair (Dor procedure?)
NECK: Supple with JVP of 16 cm.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: EKG: ([**2116-12-26**]) NSR at 87 with incomplete right bundle branch block, TWI at aVL, I and V2, with 1mm ST elevation in V2-V3.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall, with extensive apical akinesis and focal apical dyskinesis (no definite apical thrombus seen but cannot exclude with certainty).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-10-5**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is further depressed, secondary to extensive hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall.
Appropriate increased in blood pressure noted with exercise.

# ACS/ NSTEMI: Initial cardiac catherization showed restenosis of bypass grafts (except SVG-RCA) not felt to be repeat surgical candidate and thus underwent LCX stenting and PTCA to LAD.
She was evaluated by PT and her ambulatory O2 sats were 93% on room air.
# DIABETES: Her insulin regimen was uptitrated to improve blood sugar control.
You underwent cardiac catheterization and found to have blockages in multiple arteries including the grafts that were created during your recent CABG.
Your heart function was evaluated and you were found to have slightly worse heart function.
You had a second catheterization and had stents placed in some of your blocked arteries.
Please check your blood sugars before breakfast and before dinner.
