During that admission, she had an EP study and attempted VT ablation at the anterior septal aspect of the subaortic valve region.
Her ICD fired, and then fired again 30 seconds later.
Upon arrival, EP interrogated the device which showed VT at a rate of ~120 BPM, which was attempted to be broken by ATP twice and ultimately shocked twice with escalating joules.
NECK: Supple with no JVP @90 degrees.

STRESS EKG INTERPRETATION: This 67 year old woman with LVEF of 20% and history of dilated cardiomyopathy and VT was referred to the lab for evaluation.
The estimated peak MET capacity was 1.5 which represents a poor functional capacity.
Brief Hospital Course: 67-year-old woman with an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 20% (non-ischemic), moderate mitral regurgitation (improved on recent echo), BiV ICD, recent study for endocardial/epicardial ablation of multifocal VT that were found to arise from septum, lateral wall and apex, recently ablated [**2114-10-25**].
You underwent a stellate ganglion block that seems to have decreased the ventricular tachycardia.
You blood pressures have been low but you have not been dizzy or lightheaded so far.
Quinidine 324mg every 8 hours (medicine for ventricular tachycardia) 2.
You are going home with a cardionet monitor to evaluate your heart rate and rhythm while you are at home.
