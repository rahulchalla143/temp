A neurology consult was obtained, and the patient underwent a CT scan of the head, which was read by the radiology department as no evidence of acute CVA, however the neurology service felt that the patient had a right frontal subcortical hypodensity, consistent with subacute infarct thought to be due to an embolic event.
It was recommended that the patient's blood pressure should remain higher than it was and he was started on Neo-Synephrine.
Over the next few days, his neurologic status improved, his deficits, which were mainly involving the proximal muscles in his LUE and LE.
