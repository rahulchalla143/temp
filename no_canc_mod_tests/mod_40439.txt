He was initially brought to [**Hospital1 **] where his NIH Stroke Scale was 4 (breakdown unavailable, but appears to have had right arm and leg weakness as well as impaired language which was worsening during the evaluation).
CT head was negative and tPA was given at 15:39 (Bolus 7.5mg, then additional 66.3 over 60minutes).
The patient's symptoms showed almost immediate improvement and was trasferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.
Family History: Mother had stroke in her 80s Brother with a pacer Brother s/p MI at age 40   Physical Exam: At admission:  T 98.9 BP 152/84 HR 76 RR 20  O2% 98 on 2L General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, No murmurs appreciated.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
Proprioception impaired to fine movements of the 1rst toe bilaterally.
-Gait: deferred  At discharge: T 97.3 BP 150/90 HR 72 RR 18  O2% 100 RA   Fingerstick glycemia: 111 mg/dL No neurological deficit.

Echo [**2143-10-15**]: The left atrium is elongated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50-55 %).
Initial evaluation at [**Hospital1 **] was concerning for aphasia and right sided weakness.
Transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] where he had a mild right pronator drift and a brisk patellar reflex, but otherwise his neurologic exam was normal.
CT head was without evidence of prior infarct or small vessle disease.
Echo showed mildly depressed LC function EF 5-0-55% and mildly dilated ascending aorta, no source of embolus.
A CT scan was negative for bleeding so you received tPa to disolve the cloat that was causing your stroke.
Your MRI showed a small infarct (stroke) on the subcortical area of the left temporal lobe.
