EGD was notable for esophagitis and duodenitis.
Her Anion-gap (positive ketones) metabolic acidosis was attributed to starvation and alcoholic ketoacidosis--this also resolved promptly with IVF.

Several incidental findings were noted on a CT of the torso that will require oupatient follow-up: 1. a superior anterior endplate compression fracture: She will need outpt bone denisometry as this is suspicious for osteoporosis.
3. multinodular thyroid goiter: requires ultrasound for further evalaution.
