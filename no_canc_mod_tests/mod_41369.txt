However, by 11:30 after his blood pressure dipped to SBP 140-160s, his weakness and gaze deviated reappeared, with evidence of left hemisensory deficit.
Due to his initial improvement, Neurointerventional radiology were not keen to intervene, but he did go to the angiosuite after the above worsening, but the vessel could not be opened.

TECHNIQUE: CT head without contrast; CT angiogram of the head and neck with IV contrast; CT cerebral perfusion study.
FINDINGS:  NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is dense appearance of the right middle cerebral artery, representing thrombus within.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD AND NECK: The origins of the arch vessels are patent.
A few small scattered nodes are noted in both sides of the neck, not enlarged by CT size criteria.
In the apex, which can be correlated with dedicated CT chest imaging.
Mild degenerative changes are noted in the cervical spine, better assessed on the concurrent CT C-spine study.
CT C-spine without contrast: Final Report INDICATION: 68-year-old man with recent fall, with concern for stroke, to evaluate for C-spine fracture.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired through the cervical spine without intravenous contrast.
CT angiogram demonstrates a possible total occlusion of the right internal carotid artery and thrombus in the right middle cerebral artery.
A rapid transit catheter and a gold tip Glidewire was introduced to catheterize the right internal carotid artery.
Unsuccessful catheterization and recanalization of the proximal right internal carotid artery.
COMPARISON: CTA head from [**2118-6-4**] and cerebral angiogram from [**6-4**], [**2118**].
TECHNIQUE: MRI and MRA of the brain was performed without contrast per departmental protocol.
MRA OF THE BRAIN: As seen on the prior CTA and recent carotid angiogram, there is persistent occlusion of the right internal carotid artery.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler images of common femoral artery and vein demonstrate patent vessels.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of rib fracture; however, since this technique is not dedicated for evaluation of bones, should the clinical concern for rib fracture persists, dedicated rib views are recommended for further evaluation.
LABS AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: [**2118-6-8**] 05:00AM BLOOD WBC-6.8 RBC-4.37* Hgb-12.3* Hct-36.4* MCV-83 MCH-28.0 MCHC-33.7 RDW-13.2 Plt Ct-244 [**2118-6-9**] 05:35AM BLOOD PT-23.5* PTT-83.7* INR(PT)-2.2* [**2118-6-9**] 05:35AM BLOOD Calcium-8.9 Phos-3.3 Mg-1.9  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 RHM with no significant medical history (he reports having not seen a physician in many years) who noted acute onset of light-headedness and dysequilibrium followed by left sided-weakness and significant dysarthria at 7:30 AM ([**6-4**]) after taking a shower.
He presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**2118-6-4**] and was admitted to the Stroke Service for further evaluation and care.
CTP showed a large area of right MCA hypoperfusion.
However, as his blood pressure dipped to SBP 140-160s, his weakness worsened and the gaze deviation reappeared, with evidence of left hemisensory deficit.
A subsequent MRI showed patent R MCA later that night.
His goal PTT was 50-70, and was checked every 6 hours.
In the acute setting the patient required a nicardipine gtt with goal SBP 140-190's, he eventually did not require this anymore.
After his first two hospital days, the patient was started on lisinopril which was uptitrated to 20mg QD with a goal SBP of 140-180; some degree of autoregulation was desired to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion in the setting of the fixed deficit (ie the persistent R ICA occlusion).
He was continuually monitored on cardiac telemetry without any adverse events or evidence of cardiac arrhythmias.
His stroke risk factors were assessed: FLP 175, TG 76, HDL 47, LDL 113, A1C 5.4.
A TTE was obtained (see full report above) which did not show an ASD/PFO/thrombus, and the patient had a preserved EF.
A Speech and Swallow evaluation was obtained, and the patient was cleared for a regular diet.
Also, the patient will have a follow-up CTA in 3 months, to be reviewed at his follow-up appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in Neurology (scheduled prior to discharge).
#Hypertension: Patient has had goal SBP 140's-180's, he previously was not on any anti-HTN medications.
We have maintained an elevated blood pressure in order to maintain his cerebral perfusion.
#Left Rib Pain, Left Ankle Pain s/p fall: Patient had a CXR and a Left Ankle Xray without evidence of fracture.
His goal INR is [**3-18**].
His INR was 2.2 on day of discharge, and he will continue his coumadin dosing and management at his rehabilitation facility.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) D/c to rehab 2) Follow up CTA at 3 months (scheduled prior to discharge) 3) Anticoagulation with goal INR [**3-18**] on coumadin 4) Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (Neurology) 5) Follow up with Primary Care Physian - who could potentially follow the INR or help facilitate monitoring with the coumadin clinic.
Neurological Exam Prior to Discharge: Mental Status: Awake, Alert, Oriented to person, place, month, day year, able to name months of year backwards Cranial Nerves: Notable for Left Facial droop, on left lateral gaze does not entirely bury the sclerae, saccadic intrusions on lateral gaze, sensation equal V1-V3 bilaterally, tongue midline, unable to raise Left shoulder (CN [**Doctor First Name 81**]), inconsistent visual fields (on one trial extinguished to visual double simultaneous stimulation) Motor: 0/5 in left upper and left lower extremity Reflexes: unable to elicit reflexes on the L, right biceps and right patella 2; upgoing toe on right Sensory: No extinguishing to double simultaneous tactile stimulation (using face and arm)   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **], .
We performed inital imaging of your head and found out that you had a clot in several of the arteries (Right Internal Carotid and Middle Cerebral Arteries) that supply the right side of the brain.
To treat you, we started a blood thinning medication (heparin) and are giving you another medication to keep your blood thin (coumadin).
Your blood levels were checked routinely, and one of the markers in your blood of how thin it is, is known as an INR.
Your liver function tests should be checked in the next few weeks to confirm the medication is not having adverse side effects.
