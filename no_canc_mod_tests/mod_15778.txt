ECHO ([**2162-5-18**]): The left ventricular cavity is small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-5-17**], the interatrial septum and right atrium are better visualized, and the mass in the right atrium is now seen clearly to be secondary to lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.

-Blood and urine cultures: NEGATIVE on [**4-13**], [**5-21**], [**5-22**], [**5-25**], [**5-28**]  Brief Hospital Course: A 67 yo man with history of NSCLC s/p resection, EtOH, h/o DVTs on coumadin until one month PTA, recent GIB, now transferred from OSH with respiratory distress and multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli.
# Clostridium dificile colitis: This was found on stool studies from [**5-18**].
Per patient his INR was supratherapeutic at that time.
His hematocrit stablized in the mid to high 20s.
Also, of note, he underwent abdominal ultrasound to evaluate extent of liver disease, also to evaluate for portal hypertension and assess risk for varices.
The ultrasound showed no ascites, a diffusely fatter liver, and mild splenomegaly.
Hemolytic work-up was negative.
Reticulocyte count was 3.0.
Iron was 19 with a TIBC of 166 and ferritin of 232, indicative of deficiency.
# Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin was 1.9 on [**5-18**], down from 2.2 at admission; repeat albumin on [**6-2**] was 2.7.
Tbili was 0.4 with PTT 27.1 and INR 1.0.
As above, abdominal ultrasound did not show signs of cirrhosis; the liver was diffusely fatty.
# Thrombocystosis: His platelet count was trending up to low 800s at time of discharge.
Platelet levels can be followed up as outpatient after his infection has been treated.
On exam there was tenderness over the left lateral quadriceps muscle, with small amount of swelling/induration on left compared to right; there was no clear hematoma or skin discoloration.
Lower extremity doppler ultrasound showed stable DVT in left popliteal [**Month/Year (2) 5703**].
