He was admitted to the neurosurgical ICU for q4H neuro checks and SBP control < 140.
His left parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage remained stable on CT and his neuro exam remained non-focal.
Upon transfer to the floor, his neuro exam remained unremarkable and he was evaluated by PT and OT, who recommended he make a visit with cognitive neurology.
He will obtain head CT prior to appointment.
Incidental CT finding: On [**7-23**] CT C-spine, lucency was noted near screws of anterior cervical fusions, read as possible loosening.
This finding was followed up with lateral c-spine flexion and extension x-rays, which showed minimal lucency around the screws of C6, which might represent some loosening.
Incidental CT finding: 5mm RLL nodule.
Recommended follow-up CT in 6 months for high risk patients.
HTN: Patient was continued on metoprolol and lisinopril with goal SBP <140 as per neurosurgery recommendations.
Depression: Patient was continued on escitalopram  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Monitor for new neurological deficits and follow up head CT to ensure improvement - Trend platelets - Follow up alcohol cessation - Follow-up CT for incidental 5mm RLL lung nodule in 6 months - Continue to monitor for signs of instability at anterior cervical fusion site  Medications on Admission: .
Information was obtained from .
You had a lung nodule on your CT scan (5-mm right lower lobe nodule) and should have follow up CT scan in 6 months.
You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
