He was given 750 mg of levofloxacin, potassium, Vancomycin 1 gram, and 10 mg of Vitamin K.  He had a CXR which was not read as a pneumonia.

His productive cough with a leukocytosis was initially concerning for pneumonia; however, his chest x-rays were unrevealing.
Cultures were unrevealing, influenza DFA was negative, legionella ag was negative, and follow-up chest x-rays were unrevealing.
His white count rose while on the medicine floor; given that his respiratory status remained stable, this was judged unlikely to be secondary to the respiratory infection, and ultimately, more likely to be the result of a florid gout flare.
# Hypotension: Appears to be at baseline at this time, mainly in 90s-100s, and his baseline SBP is 80's to 90's per OMR records.
His lactate was 2.0 at admission, and he remains not tachycardic.
Joint aspiration of the R knee revealed hemarthrosis with joint fluid Hct of 42, which was confirmed by MRI.
Joint aspiration of the L knee revealed a high white count ([**Numeric Identifier 24869**]).
Because of our initial concern for septic joint we treated first with Ancef, and then when his white cell count continued to rise and his joints appeared to be more inflamed, we switched to vancomycin with concern for MRSA.
However, he remained afebrile and joint cultures were negative, as were joint fluid gram stains; we thus discontinued antibiotics for the joint.
With a climbing white count we were concerned for C. diff and had him on flagyl for several days; however, C. diff toxin assays were negative twice and he was taken off precautions and we did not continue flagyl.
His cultures were all negative.
# Acute renal failure: His creatinine was 3.9 at admission.
With hydration and holding his lasix, his creatinine declined to 1.5 before rising slightly again before discharge once a small dose of lasix (40 mg daily compared to his 160 mg daily home dose) was restarted.
His urine lytes and clinical picture was consistent with a mainly pre-renal picture, worse on admission secondary to poor PO and diarrhea.
Urine output improved substantially.
His INR drifted down over the admission; as above, enoxaparin (Lovenox) was started on [**12-17**] and warfarin was restarted on [**12-18**].
# COPD: He had wheezes on exam fairly frequently which improved with nebulizers and beta-agonist inhalers (levalbuterol to minimize cardiac effect).
We held this for concern for labile blood pressure as described above.
