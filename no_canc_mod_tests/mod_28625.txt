At times, she was not responsive to verbal stimuli and had increased oral secretions.

CT head during that admission did not show any acute process, and EEG suggested a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (possibly secondary to her underlying ESRD).

CT head [**2120-7-10**] Hypodensity in the left parietal lobe adjacent to the posterior lateral ventricle which was not seen on prior exam, unclear if this is due to differences in slice selection versus new hypodensity.
CT head [**2120-7-22**] Increased extent of cytotoxic edema in the left parietal lobe since [**2120-7-10**] suggests an evolving infarct.
MRI could be useful for further evaluation, if not contraindicated.

Her head CT demonstrated a possible new parietal hypodensity that was of uncertain significance but may represent a new intracerebral process.
Patient had no new focal deficits, however, exam was limited due to noncompliance.
Following stabilization of her blood pressures in the ICU, patient returned to the medicine floor.
She was on LTM and her EEG showed diffuse encephalopathy as well as intermittent epileptiform discharges.
Of note, head CT was repeated given the ?of new parietal hypodensity as above.
On repeat head CT, it was clear that she did indeed have a new infarct in that area.
Carotid b/l ultrasounds were obtained which did not show significant stenosis.
Initial Bcx x3 (drawn on [**7-8**]) show NGTD.
Repeat cultures drawn [**7-10**] secondary to change in mental status, also show no growth.
Urine legionella antigen negative.
# Hypertension: Initially, patient's systolic blood pressures ranged 160s-180s while on the medicine floor.
This normalized her blood pressure to 150-160s systolic.
Her hypertension was thought to be volume dependent, so she underwent suscessful ultrafiltration on [**7-11**].
Other acute interventions with regard to her kidney function were not acutely indicated.
# Anemia: Her hemoglobin and hematocrit are low, but similar to prior levels.

You also demonstrated jerking movements, which were seizures, confirmed also by EEG.
A repeat CAT scan of your brain showed that you recently had a new stroke.
Your blood pressure was quite high and we adjusted you medicines.
