On [**2198-3-26**], the patient underwent cardiac catheterization for progressive exertional angina.
The cardiac catheterization on [**2198-3-26**], showed one vessel disease and the patient underwent successful stenting of his left anterior descending coronary artery/diagonal two bifurcation using the crush technique.
The patient does have a history of lower gastrointestinal bleed felt secondary to hemorrhoids based on past colonoscopy and subsequently developed a hematocrit drop, reportedly from 34.0 to 26.0 while on Aspirin and Plavix.
Cardiac catheterization on arrival to [**Hospital1 190**] showed a thrombosis of the previously placed left anterior descending coronary artery stent.
Gastrointestinal bleed, colonoscopy [**2195**], reportedly found only hemorrhoids.
[**Name (NI) **] has two sons, [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 1158**], and a daughter, [**Name (NI) 20695**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival, he is afebrile, temperature 96.8, heart rate 115 to 116, blood pressure 120s to 130s over 80s to 90s, respiratory rate 23, weight 87 kilograms.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.
The neck was supple and jugular venous pressure was approximately seven centimeters at 45 degree angle.
Cardiovascular examination was regular, rate 90s to 115.
The chest was clear to auscultation anteriorly with good aeration.
Admission electrocardiogram was notable for a junctional tachycardia at 105 beats per minute, left axis deviation, ST elevations which were 3.0 millimeters V2 through V6, new compared to previous electrocardiogram [**2198-3-27**].
Cardiac catheterization on [**2198-4-16**], showed thrombotic occlusion at the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stent, treated with Rheolytic treatment, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with 20 percent residual disease at the left anterior descending coronary artery stent, 40 percent at the diagonal origin.
Hemodynamics in the cardiac catheterization laboratory were reported at cardiac index of 3.4, cardiac output of 7.13, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure with a mean of 35 and right atrial mean pressure of 17 and pulmonary artery pressures of 44/29.
Laboratory from outside hospital showed a CK of 60, MB 0.8.
Chem7 showed sodium of 142, potassium 3.9, chloride 105, bicarbonate 20, blood urea nitrogen 28, creatinine 1.6, glucose 157.
Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 9.0, hematocrit 29.8, platelet count 364,000, MCV 82.
Calcium 8.8, ALT 23, AST 17.
Albumin 3.3, total bilirubin 0.3, alkaline phosphatase 109.
INR 1.02, partial thromboplastin time 20.0.
Post cardiac catheterization, the patient was continued on Heparin therapy.
Post cardiac catheterization, the patient require intraaortic balloon pump to maintain cardiac output.
In addition, he was requiring Dopamine for blood pressure support.
The patient had an echocardiogram to evaluate his myocardial function post ST elevation myocardial infarction.
The patient's echocardiogram documented his left atrium was mildly dilated.
His ejection fraction was approximately 25 percent.
He should have his liver function tests reevaluated four weeks after initiating this medication on [**2198-4-16**].
Electrocardiogram of this rhythm noted it to be most consistent with atrial fibrillation.
In addition, the patient had received significant volume resuscitation with his hypotension post cardiac catheterization and intraaortic balloon pump placement.
However, after several days, his blood pressure stabilized and we were able to further diurese the patient with intravenous Lasix.
Initial Swan pressures showed right atrial pressure 18, right ventricular pressure 51/20, pulmonary artery pressures 55/30/44 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of approximately 35, however, this was felt to be a poor wedge.
Repeat wedge pressures was a mean of 23.
Cultures were sent.
Cultures did not grow any bacteria.
Upper endoscopy was performed which documented three gastric erosions which were not actually bleeding but were felt to be the source of the gastrointestinal bleed.
In addition, he was tested for H. pylori antigen and his H. pylori antibody was positive suggestive of active or past infection.
E. coli bacteremia - On [**2198-4-23**], the patient had blood cultures drawn.
However, after the blood cultures grew out E. coli, the patient's antibiotics were narrowed to Ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously once daily.
All repeat blood cultures from [**2198-4-24**], [**2198-4-26**], [**2198-4-27**], [**2198-4-28**], have been no growth to date at the time of this dictation.
Arrhythmia, sinus pause - The patient was noted to have significant sinus pause with beta blocker treatment of rapid atrial fibrillation.
Aspiration - Concern was raised regarding the patient's ability to swallow without aspiration.
The patient did have a bedside swallowing evaluation on [**2198-4-25**].
Bedside swallow evaluation recommended that the patient have a video swallow to definitively rule out aspiration and make safe diet recommendations.
