A Chem 7 at rehabilitation revealed a hyperkalemia to 7.
The patient also became hypotensive to a blood pressure of 69 and she was given four to five liters of normal saline as a fluid rehydration.
At this time her potassium was found to be 8.9 and her Bicarbonate was 10 and a blood gas demonstrated pH of 7.2; PO2 of 128; PCO2 of 20.
Avandia 8 q d.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION TO THE MICU:  Blood pressure, 116/39; pulse, 146; 87% with a poor wave form.
The patient had an otherwise unremarkable examination with cool extremities.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION SHOWED:  Sodium, 123; potassium, 8.9; chloride, 89; bicarbonate, 10.
White blood count, 27.8.
Arterial blood gases, 7.2/20/128.
She was rehydrated aggressively with normal saline and her electrolytes abnormalities self-corrected as well as her renal failure.
EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR:  Afebrile; blood pressure, 108/45; pulse, 75; respirations, 13; 100% on three liter nasal cannula.
The patient had had 2,026 of intravenous fluid in/2,020 of urine out and only 200 of ostomy out.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils are equal and reactive to light and accommodation.
Chest, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
White blood count, 13,000, down from 27,000.
Hematocrit, 25, down from 38 and stabilized at 25, status post large volume hydration.
BUN, 45, down from 99; admission creatinine, 1.3, down from 4.8 on admission.
Troponin, 5.9; CK, negative x 3.
The troponin peak was 5.9; next one was 4.2 six hours later.
Alkaline phosphatase, 43.
Calcium, 9.3; magnesium, 1.7; phosphorus, 3.4; amylase, 66; lipase, 185.
Electrocardiogram, initially on admission, showed sinus rhythm with prolonged PR of 224; prolonged QRS of 142; large R wave in V1 and V2 with poor R wave progression and T wave depressions V1 through V5 that were new.
On [**2196-5-11**], the patient had an electrocardiogram with slow atrial flutter with ventricular rate that was irregular at 25 beats per minute with peak T waves.
Renal ultrasound done showed kidneys of 10 and 11 cm with no hydronephrosis.
A chest x-ray, initially on admission, showed perihilar haziness consistent with mild congestive heart failure and on the next day, [**2196-5-12**], showed improved congestive heart failure.
On day of discharge, her creatinine was 0.6 with a BUN of 9.
Cardiology - The patient was status post PEA arrest in the setting of acidosis and hyperkalemia of 8.9.
Electrophysiologic - The patient had one episode of atrial fibrillation, status post her cardiac arrest that was electrically cardioverted.
She did have a troponin of 5.9 status post cardioversion that was likely the result of shock.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition - The patient, on admission, had severe hyperkalemia secondary to acute renal failure that was corrected upon admission with calcium, Insulin, intravenous fluid hydration and resolution of her acute renal failure.
However, her ins and outs during this hospitalization have not been consistent with large ostomy output.
Her Clostridium Difficile and stool studies were negative.
Dermatologic - The patient had ecchymotic areas on her right forearm.
A Dermatology consult was called and Dermatology did a biopsy of this lesion.
Hematologic - The patient hematocrit went from 38 to 25 after a large volume fluid rehydration.
She was transfused two units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in her hematocrit and this has been stable throughout her hospitalization and is now at 33.4.
She should follow up with Dermatology and perhaps Gastroenterology if her ostomy output is shown to be high.
Anion gap acidosis which is resolved.
Loperamide prn ostomy output between 500 and 1,000 cc per day.
q d although her blood sugars were fairly well controlled with diet with a range of 134 to 210.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient should follow up with her Primary Care Doctor in one to two weeks and with Dermatology at [**Hospital6 1760**] within one week for removal of her stitches from her biopsy and follow up of her right arm ecchymotic and bullous areas.
