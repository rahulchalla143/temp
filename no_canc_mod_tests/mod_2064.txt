ECG ([**2103-11-24**]): Reg sinus rhythm 80, normal axis, normal PR and QT intervals, narrow QRS, mild (<1mm) ST depressions in II, III, avF, V3, V4 .
CARDIAC ECHO ([**2103-11-27**]): Conclusions: LA normal in size.
MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION SCAN ([**2102-1-12**]) Patient was stressed with persantine followed by 5 min of exercise.
He attained 87% of his maximum heart rate and stress was stopped because of fatigue.
EKG showed 1.5 mm ST segment depressions in leads II, III, and AVF.
The stress images demonstrated a mild defect of the inferior wall and septum.

Cath lab revealed 3-VD, no wall motion abnormalities and EF of 55%.
CAD (cath today showed 3-VD with mid-RCA 60%, mid LAD 95%, diag-2 95% and OM-2 99% occluded).
Patient was seen by cardiothoracic surgery and the decision was made to perform revascularization via CABG - pre-op for CABG done: CXR - normal, UA - negative, type and screen x2, ECG - no changes from the previous ones - given the severity of coronary defects, patient remained on Integrillin/Heparin infusions until 24 hrs prior to surgery - patient was started on ASA 325mg qd, ACEI (Captopril 6.25 mg tid), statin (Lipitor 80mg qd), and BB (metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **]).
- lipid profile done, Triglyc-107 HDL-49 CHOL/HD-4.9 LDLcalc-170.
[**Name (NI) **] - pt is euvolemic on exam - pt will continue on ACEI and beta-blocker (see above) - echo done to evaluate EF - Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, LV EF>55%.
Post-cath anticoagulation - patient was on Heparin and Integrillin infusions post-cath with Integrillin discontinued [**2103-11-29**], >12hrs prior to surgery - patient compained of a small hematoma in rt cubital area that appeared [**11-28**] and looked much improved [**11-29**], resolved [**11-30**] - he also compained of a "small lump" in his rt groin, which looked like a small ecchymosis.
Hct 37.9 on admission, 41.7 on [**11-27**], and 39 on [**11-29**].
DVT prophylaxis - pt already on integrillin/heparin .
Disposition - CABG pending - since pt felt very overwhelmed, SW consult was done  Surgery delayed for ICU beds.
CXR on [**12-2**] showed no pulm.
Pulmonary toilet was encouraged, and the patient continued to improve his activity tolerance.
