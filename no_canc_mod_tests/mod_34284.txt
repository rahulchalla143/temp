CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: None -PACING/ICD: - [**Company 1543**] Sensia SEDR01 dual chamber pacemaker with 100% V-paced.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - L femur fracture s/p ORIF on [**2113-5-2**] - AS, valve area 0.7 on TTE in [**11-15**] - Acute on chronic Diastolic CHF - Atrial fibrillation - [**Date Range **] rotator cuff (left) - pulmonary hypertension - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - History of GI bleeding [**10-16**] upper and lower endoscopy with no findings.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 6 cm.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: Echocardiogram [**2115-2-6**] Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-1-31**], the right ventricle is probably slightly more dilated and hypokinetic than on prior study (the RV was probably mildly dilated and hypokinetic on the prior study, although reported as normal).

A repeat urine culture revealed a subsequent urinary tract infection with ESCHERICHIA COLI.
The urine culture was repeated and was negative.
