She was given levofloxacin and metronidazole for possible infection, calcium for possible Beta blocker toxicity (unclear how many beta blockers she is on, but she was never bradycardic); her hematocrit was noted to be stable since discharge.
Per report, the BIN non-contrast CT abd/pelvis showed atelectasis, a minimally enlarged gall bladder, and a question of colitis, without RP bleed.
She received 3-4L IVF, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her triage vitals were pain [**9-22**], HR 70, BP 124/70 (on pressors), RR 12, Sat 99%RA.
A CT with IV contrast (Mucomyst given) was ordered given a slightly lower creatinine on repeat labs.
An echo (by cards fellow) to evaluate for RV strain demonstrated minimal RV dilatation with no focal wall abnormality.
CT torso demonstrated no PE, atelectasis, CBD dilation without obstruction, cholelithiasis, and peripancreatic stranding less prominent than on [**Location (un) 620**] CT. A RUQ ultrasound demonstrated a distended gall bladder with pericholecystic and perihepatic fluid, with gallstone and mild GB wall thickening, consistent with acute cholecystitis.
Her phenylephrine was at 0.1mcg and quickly removed.
