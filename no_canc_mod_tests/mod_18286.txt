She presented to OSH and CT showed R PICA stroke.
Review of Head CT showed large right PICA cerebellar infarct with midline shift and pressure on the 4th ventricle.
Non-contrast Head CT: 1.
Acute right posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarct with blood products.
Small incidental calcified meningioma right temporal region  Head CT [**8-23**]: -new cerebellar bleed  Brief Hospital Course: # Strokes/Mental Status: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with a large cerebellar stroke with evidence of compression of her fourth ventricle and hydrocephalus of the 3rd ventricle.
A TTE showed a large PFO with an Atrial septal aneurysm therefore her mechanism was felt to be likely thromboembolic.
Her INR will need to be monitored and coumidin increased with a INR goal of [**12-22**].5. .
# Respiratory Distress: Patient received tracheostomy on [**2152-11-30**], and her chest x-ray has demonstrated much improvement, only notable for persistent lll collapse.
Given her repeated collapse noted on chest x-ray and on repeat bronchoscopies, patient may be candidate for stent placement from interventional pulmonology in the future.
And chest xray did not suggest a pneumonia.
As a result, fluoxetine was discontinued, and fentanyl IV was weaned and transitionned to a patch.
A repeat head CT shows no new bleeding or lesions, but increased size of pseudomeningocele.
# Fever: Patient continued to have low grade fevers and leukopenia, however no systemic signs of infection were noted, and cultures remained negative.
Her lisinopril was restarted at a low dose of 2.5mg and her blood pressures were stable at the time of discharge.
He blood pressure should be monitored and medications titrated as needed to maintain good blood pressure control.
#Metabolic Alkalosis:  Patient noted to have small metabolic alkalosis, pH 7.44 HCO3 36 at the time of discharge.
# Anemia: Hct 28-32 during this admission, and was stable in mid-20s during ICU stay.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# DM  blood sugars at goal at this time on NPH 13 units in AM and PM.
Her blood sugars should be followed at rehab and insulin titrated as needed.
Patient would likely benefit from an [**Doctor Last Name 360**] to replace her fluoxetine, and further psychiatric evaluation during her rehabilitation stay.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Hospital1 **]: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution [**Hospital1 **]: 5000 (5000) units Injection TID (3 times a day): please stop when patient's INR is stable at 2.0-2.5 on the coumidin.
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)): please titrate dose to achieve INR of [**12-22**].5.
