Sepsis: Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] tachycardic, initially hypotensive responding to IVFs, and leukocytosis with positive UA and CXR c/w pneumonia.
His blood cultures remained negative, but his urine grew resistant E.coli which was sensitive to cefepime.
The sputum grew P. aureginosa which was also found to be sensitive to cefepime.
Acute Kidney Injury: creatinine up to 1.9 from 0.7 on [**3-21**]; this was most likely in the setting of hypotension/sepsis in the setting of infection.
With IVFs his creatinine improved back to his baseline of <1.0.
He had a bronchoscopy revealing no significant aiway obstruction but has LLL bronchus with severe narrowing at opening likely contributing to chronic collapse, not amenable to stenting.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Urinary Tract [**Hospital **] Hospital Acquired/Ventilator associated Pneumonia Secondary Diagnosis: Spina Bifida Diabetes Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable, ventilator dependent.
You also had a bronchoscopy which showed chronic stenosis of left lower lobe bronchus.
