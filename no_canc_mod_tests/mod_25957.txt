His hemodynamics were stable after resuscitation with fluid and blood.
He also had an Opthomology exam for bilateral contusions and there was no evidence of herniation just some periorbital edema and ecchymosis.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and his hematocrit was stable.
His chest Xray revealed bibasilar atelectasis and he was subsequently transferred back to the ICU for further management.
He had a Chest CTA which ruled out PE and showed bilateral lower lobe collapse.
Bronchoscopy was done, secretions were cleared and BAL was sent which grew nothing.
