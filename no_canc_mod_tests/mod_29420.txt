A more nodular opacity in the left upper lobe likely also represents a contusion, but follow up study could be performed to ensure resolution.

Orthopedics was consulted given his multiple injuries; he was taken to the operating room on [**12-2**] for evaluation under anesthesia left knee, EUA left ankle, irrigation, debridement of left open knee and closed treatment left ankle fracture.
Neurosurgery was consulted for his right frontal contusion, intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhages; these injuries were non operative.
Repeat head imaging showed stable appearance of the head bleed.
A CT scan of his pelvis was order by Orthopedics to assess worsening of his pelvic fractures given his inability to maintain non weight bearing.
He underwent repeat CT scan several days later which was unchanged; he will not require surgical intervention of these fractures at this time; instead he will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**], Orthopedics, in 1 week for repeat imaging studies.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
