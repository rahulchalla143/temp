Lyme titers were sent which were not positive for either IgM or IgG.
The patient's systolic blood pressure dropped to 70, but he responded to IV fluids and dopamine.
Titers were sent for tularemia as well as blood cultures being sent for Ehrlichia, Yersinia and other rickettsial diseases.
The patient had improved since admission, although it was not known if this was from the antibiotics that were started or from his pathology running its course.
EKG showed some diffuse ST segment elevations and prolonged PR interval.
Labs upon transfer to the floor were white count 12.2 which was down from 25.2, hematocrit 34.1, thrombocytosis of 411 which was up from 201 on admission.

Blood cultures were negative for growth times two.
Urine was dark amber in color with large blood, but only 2 RBC, positive for urobilinogen and trace protein.
Lower extremity Doppler of the area showed enlarged lymph nodes in the left groin area that are probably reactive, but no fluid collections.
Chest x-ray showed a small right pleural effusion, otherwise within normal limits.
EKG on [**7-23**] showed borderline first degree AV block which was resolved by [**7-26**], but had an increased PR interval and multiple lead ST changes.
Echo also done in-house showed LVEF greater than 55 percent with no vegetations, no pericardial effusion.
On physical exam vital signs t-max 98.5, t-current 97.4, pulse 101 ranging from 77 to 101, blood pressure 126/67 with systolic ranging from 109 to 126, respirations 24 ranging from 21 to 34, O2 sat 94 to 99 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender, positive bowel sounds, no rash, lesions or nodules visualized on his anterior abdomen or lower back.
Neurologic exam cranial nerves II- XII grossly intact.
Blood cultures were sent including instructions for growing out rickettsial diseases, which in this area would include ehrlichiosis, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9880**] spotted fever and Lyme disease.
His signs and symptoms of pericarditis as well as signs of pericarditis on EKG were also not present on day of discharge.
As his ASO was negative, anti-DNase, DNA-SD, anti- DNase B and antihyaluronidase were also checked before discharge.
A throat culture was done for beta strep and the primary consulted with the infectious disease team who believe that aspirin for the initial diagnosis of rheumatic fever was not necessary as this was more likely an infectious etiology.
He was taking a full diet, had been afebrile for at least 24 hours, had very stable white count, showed no other pertinent signs on physical exam except for an apparently resolving, [**Doctor Last Name **], reticular rash in the same left inguinal area with a very stable subcutaneous nodule that is most likely a lymph node.
FOLLOWUP:  The patient was given an appointment with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] is Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], in his [**Location 27224**] for [**8-12**] at 10:50 a.m. to discuss appropriateness of continuing doxycycline for a one month regimen based on Lyme titers, ESR and CRP which were drawn at [**Hospital1 18**] on the day of discharge.
if the rash is not resolving, if he experiences high fever, myalgias, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath or any other condition he believes needs to be seen by a medical professional.
