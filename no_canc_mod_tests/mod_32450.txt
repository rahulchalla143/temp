Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
# CORONARIES: Patient was found to have a STEMI with CK 385 on admission.
He did have ongoing left shoulder pain that was similar to his chronic pain, but cardiac enzymes trended down after the cath and there was low suspicion for recurrent ischemia.
Full-dose aspirin, clopidogrel, and high-dose statin were started.
Echo showed inferior and septal hypokinesis, but LVEF 60%, so no ACEI was indicated.
Lipid panel was at goal (LDL 59).
You underwent a cardiac catheterization, and a stent was placed in one of the arteries in your heart.
