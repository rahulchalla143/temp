At [**Hospital3 6265**] the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with creatinine kinase in the 500 and troponin of 6.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was afebrile, blood pressure 127/79, pulse 97, respirations 24, sating 99% on 5 liters of nasal cannula.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rhythm, tachycardiac, normal S1 and S2.
Respiratory examination revealed decreased breathsounds at the left, part of the way up, but was otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The patient extremities 2 to 3+ pitting edema bilaterally, dorsalis pedis were 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values on admission were significant for a white count of 7.6, hematocrit 32.4.
Chem-7 was significant for a creatinine of 1.9.
On admission the creatinine kinase was 453, MB 90, troponin I 15.6.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed a right dominant system, two vessel disease, left main 10%, proximal left anterior descending 60% occlusion, mid left anterior descending 60% occlusion.
The patient's ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of 46%, 2+ mitral regurgitation, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 24 and left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 30.
The patient's post procedure experienced an increased work of breathing.
An echocardiogram was performed with an ejection fraction of 35 to 40%.
The patient was diuresed after his catheterization with Lasix to improve his decompensated congestive heart failure.
The patient's chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.
The patient was diuresed and his oxygen saturations improved significantly.
Renal - Patient with baseline chronic renal insufficiency with acute renal failure after his cardiac catheterization with a creatinine rising to 3.8, consistent with a dye-induced nephropathy.
Two days after the cardiac catheterization the patient's creatinine began to improve and at the time of discharge the patient's creatinine had returned to his baseline values.
The patient's hematocrit dropped to 28 after the catheterization and the patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable at this level.
Magnesium oxide 400 b.i.d.
The patient should also follow up with his primary care physician for blood draw within the next one to two weeks for further monitoring of his renal function as well as his electrolytes, in particular magnesium given the addition of magnesium replacement.
