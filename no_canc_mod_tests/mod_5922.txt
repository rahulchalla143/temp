This raises suspicion of hemorrhage into a pre-existing arachnoid cyst, which was present at this site.
CT Head [**8-18**]: FINDINGS: Please note, some of the images were degraded by motion artifact and were repeated.
Differential considerations remain unchanged and include potential arachnoid cyst.
Head CT [**8-19**]: FINDINGS: Again identified is a right parafalcine subdural hematoma with a focal area of hypodensity, minimally smaller in its widest posterior aspect when compared to prior exam (2a:20), but overall little changed.
CT C-spine [**8-17**]: FINDINGS: There is no fracture or dislocation.
There are marked degenerative changes with loss of intervertebral disc height between C4/C5, C5/C6, and C6/C7 with anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6.
The visualized outline of thecal sac appears normal apart from canal narrowing at C5/C6; however, CT cannot provide detail comparable to MRI.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2131-8-20**] 8:34 PM Slight increase in the bibasilar pleural effusions with mild stable cardiomegaly and minimal pulmonary venous congestion.
Her head CT was repeated upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], and found to be essentially stable.
Given her history of being on coumadin for atrial fibrillation, she was admitted to the ICU for q1h neuro monitoring and anticoagulation was reversed.
Her head CT was again repeated on [**8-19**], and she was determined to be stable for transfer out of the ICU to the neurosurgical floor.
On [**8-22**], patient blood pressure and heart rate decreased after her morning dose of lopressor and enalapril.
After an hour, her vital signs were repeated and were stable.
Geriatric repeated EKG and reviewed report, stated that she would be safe for d/c because there is no infarct on EKG.
Medications on Admission: counadin 1', simvastatin 20',lasix 20'',enalapril 20', digoxin 0.125",metoprolol 50'', KCl 20',namenda 10'', trazadone 50 hs, tylenol prn   Discharge Medications: 1.
Recommendations for non-pharmacologic delirium prevention: 1) Remove all lines and catheters as soon as possible, esp Foley  2) Avoid sedatives, especially antihistamines and benzodiazepines 3) Encourage family to be at bedside, with familiar home objects  4) Explore and encourage baseline religious/spiritual coping mechanisms for illness.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
