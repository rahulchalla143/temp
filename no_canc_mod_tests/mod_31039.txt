At that time the patient was treated with steroid injections and po Prednisone which caused an increase in his blood sugars.
For this increase in blood sugars he was started on Humalog approximately 3-5 days ago as his sugars have been in the 300-400's on his previous regimen.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, temperature 99.5, heart rate 83, blood pressure 170/125, respiratory rate 18, satting 100% on two liters nasal cannula.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Reflexes 2+ bilaterally biceps and Achilles strength, [**3-29**] upper extremities bilaterally, in the left lower extremity is 4+/5 strength in his right big toe and plantar and dorsiflexion of his foot.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 14.6, differential with 84 neutrophils, 1 band, 10 lymphs, hematocrit 44.4, platelet count 134,000, PT 11.7, PTT 21.4, INR 0.9.
SMA 7, 137, 5.2 which was hemolyzed, 100, 21, 40, 1.4, glucose 297.
Calcium 8.4, phosphorus 4.7, magnesium 2.1, AST 24, ALT 28, total bilirubin 0.9, CK 54, troponin 0.3, alkaline phosphatase 59, amylase 114, lipase 41, albumin 3.3, uric acid 4.3, TSH is pending at this time.
Chest x-ray showed no signs of pulmonary edema and no infiltrate.
EKG was irregularly irregular at 92, axis -30, occasional P waves, looking like flutter but there are also absent P waves.
An echocardiogram from [**2160-4-25**] showed mild left atrial dilatation, non obstructive focal septal hypertrophy, depressed LV function 1+ aortic regurg, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] fraction could not be estimated at that time.
Physical exam was remarkable for the atrial fibrillation with guaiac positive stool and mild left lower quadrant tenderness.
Labs revealed an increased white blood cell count with left shift and low albumin.
Chest x-ray and EKG are normal and unchanged respectively.
Cultures of urine, stool and blood will be sent.
Blood cultures will be obtained when the patient's fever curve is greater than 101.
We will guaiac all stools and we will follow hematocrit q d on Heparin.
Renal:  The patient has a creatinine of 1.4 with an elevated BUN to creatinine ratio.
The stool samples and the TSH are still pending.
Also on the third hospital day the patient became tachycardic and hypotensive with blood pressure in the 60's/30's.
Exam was unchanged from prior.
IV fluids were given and EKG was done that was unchanged.
The Heparin was discontinued and an NG lavage was performed that showed dark brown fluid in the stomach with occasional clots which were Gastroccult positive.
A stat hematocrit came back at 26 which was down from 44 on admission, although this is partly due to rehydration, this is significantly due to an upper GI bleed.
Hematocrits were continually followed and an H. pylori antibody was checked.
The TSH level came back as normal at this time.
The patient's hematocrit post transfusion rose to 31 and has continued to rise since then.
His creatinine and BUN bumped transiently during the patient's hypovolemia episodes.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained because the patient is usually followed in [**Last Name (un) **], to further optimize the patient's insulin regimen.
