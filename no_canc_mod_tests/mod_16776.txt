ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of [**Street Address(2) 52288**] depressions of 1.5 to 1 mm in leads V2 through V6.
A repeat EGD with banding of several more esophageal varices which were oozing.
The second complicated by hepatic artery puncture, the third TIPS procedure was successful with decreasing patient's portal pressure of 63 to 22.
Following the third TIPS procedure, his liver function tests were monitored and continued to climb including a total bilirubin, which increased on a daily basis until the time of the patient's death on [**9-11**].
Cardiac:  On arrival, the patient was in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and was noted to be hypotensive.
Patient was started on Natrecor on the 11th, and noted to have a decreased blood pressure, which responded to boluses and decreasing sedation medications.
The following week attempts were made to diurese him aggressively with Natrecor, but his blood pressure did not tolerate this.
The following week the Lasix drip was discontinued when his creatinine increased.
Infectious disease:  Urinalysis shortly after admission showed the patient had a urinary tract infection and a culture positive for proteus.
Multiple cultures of the blood, sputum, and peritoneal fluid were negative for organisms and there were no malignant cells in the peritoneal fluid.
Two to three days before his death the patient was noted to have a sputum culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus and ultimately bacteremia with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which continued to persist despite Vancomycin treatment until the patient's death on [**9-11**].
