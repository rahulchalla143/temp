The remainder of the physical examination was notable for a shift of the mandibular midline secondary to loss of support of the right mandibular body with a large separation of the fracture region with concomitant buckle and facial swelling overlying the area.
Immediately following the surgery, she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for the above-stated monitoring  of her flap.
She also had a swallow study obtained just prior to her discharge; the results of which indicated poor oral transit with aspiration; however, there was no evidence of fistula.
