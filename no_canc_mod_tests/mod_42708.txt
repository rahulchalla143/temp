Magnesium of 1.5.
Fractional excretion of sodium was less than 1.
PT 12.7, PTT 25.9, and INR of 1.1.
She had a wedge pressure of 17.
Her vital signs were stable with a temperature maximum of 99.1, a heart rate of 80, blood pressure of 120/64, respirations of 12, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation 99%, with a central venous pressure of 15, cardiac output of 6.1, cardiac index of 2.25, with systemic vascularization of 1070.
Blood gas revealed a pH of 7.4, CO2 of 34, oxygen of 162, base excess of negative 2.
Total ins over 24 hours at that point were 2949 cc in and 405 cc of urine.
At that point, on postoperative day one, notable laboratories included a BUN of 33, and a creatinine down to 2.4.
Abdominal, cardiac, and respiratory examinations were unremarkable.
By that same day, the first day of transfer, the patient was up and ambulating on the floor, tolerating a stage I diet with good urine output in the 40 cc out range.
She was afebrile with a temperature of 98.9, heart rate of 90, blood pressure 118/76, respiratory rate of 16.
Cardiovascular examination was unchanged.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Vital signs were stable, afebrile at 97.5, heart rate of 77, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 140/66, satting 99% on room air.
Her most recent laboratory results from [**8-19**] showed a BUN 22, creatinine of 1.1 and continuing to trend downward, good urine output.
Of note, on the [**8-17**] thyroid function tests were obtained with a TSH of 3, T4 of 5, T3 of less than 30.
Pulmonary examination revealed clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Arrangements were made for visiting nurse to perform wound checks and G-tube checks for three days at home.
The patient was advised to follow up with her primary care physician in the next two weeks to monitor blood pressure and thyroid function with possible need for adjustment of these medications.
