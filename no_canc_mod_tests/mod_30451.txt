The patient was placed on argatroban gtt to achieve a therapeutic INR of 2.5. .
She was transfused 2 units PRBC During her admission.
You were admitted directly to the ICU because your blood pressure was very low requiring medications to maintain an acceptable level.
Your INR level is still slightly low, we discussed the risks of discharging you before it is completely therapeutic.
You will check your INR with your home machine on the day after discharge.
If your INR is <2.5 you will take 2mg of coumadin, if it is between 2.5-3.5 you will take 1.5 mg of coumadin, if your INR is >3.5 you will take only 1mg of coumadin.
