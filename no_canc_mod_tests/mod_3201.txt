She was afebrile, however, a CXR demonstrated new patchy RLL infiltrate and so antibiotic coverage was broadened from cipro/metronidazole to cefepime/vanc.
On transfer to the ICU, she is minimally responsive to painful stimuli, hypotensive to 70s/30s, mildly tachycardic to the 100-110 range, and sating 90-93% on a NRB.
ABG on NRB is 7.41/32/72.
An urgent femoral line, and arterial line were placed, and the patient was intubated.
Neuro exam was also notable for only minimal withdrawal to painful stimuli in left foot.
Emergent head CT was performed that demonstrated severe cerebral edema w/o e/o herniation.
Patient was hyperventilated, started on mannitol with HOB elevation to 30 degrees to reduce CNS pressures.
EEG/MRI performed that confirmed lack of cortical brain wave activity, and MRI with severe ischemia c/w global hypoxic/ischemic insult vs. hepatic/renal failure.
