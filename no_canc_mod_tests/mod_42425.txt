She reportedly had a left sided headache which started on the morning of admission and her blood sugar was low earlier in the day but that corrected with food although her confusion did not improve.
Subsequently she came into the emergency department for the headache and had a head CT which showed a right thalamic basal ganglia bleed with extension into the lateral and third ventricles.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initially the patient is afebrile, blood pressure 160 to 210/80 to 100.
Pulse 70 to 100.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Nonicteric sclera.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  On [**2116-6-8**] white count 15.6, hematocrit 27.9, she has been intermittently transfused throughout this hospital course.
Platelets 510, INR 1.2, PTT 28.4, Prothrombin time 13.7.
Sedimentation rate 138 on [**6-3**].
Most recent Cerebrospinal fluid sent on [**6-7**] showed a white count of 8, RBC 1210.
Glucose 166, creatinine 4.9, BUN 50, sodium 133, potassium 4.0, chloride 94, bicarbonate 25.
She did have rising liver function tests which started to decrease however, amylase and lipase as of [**6-8**] were still rising.
Amylase on [**6-8**] was 142.
ALT 49, AST 75, LDH 168, alk phos 1102, total bilirubin 0.3.
Lipase 195.
CRP was 19.
Total protein was assessed 51, glucose 68.
Sputum sent on [**6-7**] is growing staph aureus coag positive.
Blood cultures [**6-7**] no growth to date.
[**5-23**] growing staph coag negative in [**2-9**] bottles sensitive to Clindamycin, Erythromycin, Rifampin, Tetracycline and Vancomycin.
CT of the abdomen which was a repeat CT from [**5-24**] was unchanged since that date.
The most recent head CT on [**2116-6-2**] showed stable appearance of the brain.
Original head CT revealed hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia area and right thalamus with extension to the right lateral ventricle with mild dilatation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle which remained unchanged for sometime.
Chest x-ray most recently were clear.
EEG on [**2116-5-22**] showed background slowing and indicating wide spread encephalopathic condition.
This was felt to be due to hypertension as she came in with systolic blood pressures above 200 and her family stated she had been non-complication with her anti-hypertensives at home.
Her ventricular drain has been draining a significant amount of fluid throughout the hospital course.
The patient has been redosed for levels less than 15 and all blood cultures have been negative since [**2116-5-23**].
She did develop some loose stools and C. diff was sent which was positive and the patient was started on Flagyl for treatment of this.
Infectious Disease recommended repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis which was not revealing for any new pathology.
Her blood sugars have been well controlled with the [**Last Name (un) 3208**] consulting.
The patient did have transient elevation of ALT and AST which now seem to be decreasing.
Per abdominal CT there are no abscesses to explain this and the total bilirubin has not been elevated at all.
The patient has had guaiac negative stool but does suffer from chronic anemia and has had intermittent transfusions to attempt to keep her hematocrit at 30.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has been continued on Nicardipine, Labetalol and Hydralazine in order to keep her systolic blood pressure below 150.
