In the ICU, she required no further fluids and maintained a SBP 80s-100s, which appears to be her baseline.
Labs were significant for lactate 1.7, D-dimer 323, trop 0.08.
A bedside ECHO revealed no evidence of effusion.
CTA showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndromes.

CTA chest [**9-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR PA and lateral [**9-24**]: IMPRESSION: Interval development of mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
She had an AM cortisol of 3.5 and was placed on stress dose steroids of 50 mg hydrocortisone q6hr.
She tolerated this medication well, with SBP 90-100 on discharge.
She had an EKG which was unchanged from prior and continued to show a RBBB.
Her troponins were trended and were slightly elevated, although in the setting of ESRD, that would not be unexpected and she is very unlikely to have experienced an ischemic event.
She had a normal Echo and a CTA which did not show evidence of a PE.
She had a complete neuro exam that showed mostly L paraspinal tenderness with left leg lift tests, normal strength, no saddle anesthesia.
She had plain films of her thoracic and lumbar spine which showed no evidence of fracture or malalignment.
She had finger sticks QAHS.

We gave you fluids and some steroids to help with your blood pressure.
We also did many tests to determine the cause of your chest pain.
We did EKGs, followed cardiac enzymes, did a CT scan of your chest and have determined that you most likely did not have an acute cardiac event or pulmonary blood clot.
