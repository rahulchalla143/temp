He was noted to have a blood pressure 78/30 and was treated with normal saline, Levaquin and Albuterol nebulizers.
Chem 7 showed hypoglycemia and anion gap acidosis after which he got D50, magnesium, bicarbonate, banana bag, 1 liter of normal saline and Ativan.
Later in the Emergency Department he vomited coffee ground emesis and a nasogastric lavage with 300 cc showed coffee grounds and returned bilious fluids.
A bedside echo to rule out tamponade was negative.
Hepatitis - presumably alcoholic.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In the MICU he was made NPO but put on aggressive IV fluids, Protonix drip and received one unit of packed red blood cell for hematocrit of 22.6.
A GI consult was obtained and recommended EGD once the patient was more stable.
This was felt possibly secondary to sepsis as 1 out of 6 blood culture bottles was positive for gram negative rods and gram positive cocci.
Abdomen was noted to be increasingly distended and a paracentesis was performed with an SAAG of 1.6.
CT scan of the abdomen showed moderate ascites, gallstones, no  VBD dilatation and pancreas without any evidence of necrosis or cytosis formation.
His hematocrit dropped to 26.
PCG of the abdomen showed pulmonary consolidation, marked fatty liver, no pancreatic stenosis or necrosis and gallstones with no evidence of cholecystitis.
