At [**Hospital1 **], a head CT showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage so she was transferred here for neurosurgical evaluation.
She was initially awake, alert and oriented with a normal neuro exam in their ED, but she developed a left facial droop and UE weakness during the ambulance ride.
A repeat head CT here revealed large bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages as well as a large right-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Another CT scan the morning after admission showed slight subfalcine herniation.
The MICU team did discuss anticoagulation with the patient's family on multiple occasions, including the risks and benefits of remaining off of the anticoagulation with her known atrial fibrillation and cardiac dysfunction.
Serial head CTs were unchanged.
Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse friable mucosa in both bronchial trees and a small amount of thin secretions.
Lavage of her left upper lobe grew nothing, but sputum culture did grow MSSA.
Blood cultures grew coagulase negative Staph from 1/4 bottles and were felt to be contaminant.
She had a bedside swallow on [**12-9**] which she failed.
CAD status post anterior MI nine years ago, most recent cath [**6-28**] with 80% mLAD (not stented) and 90% LCx (stented w/DES) 4.

[**11-26**] CT Head w/o Contrast 1.
If the cause of this hemorrhage is unknown, then further evaluation with an MRI should be considered.
[**11-26**] CT Maxillofacial 1.
While no definite fractures are identified, an occult fracture can not be excluded.
There are areas of bilateral subarachnoid and right-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen, which are better and more completely evaluated on the dedicated CT scan of the head performed at the same time.
CT provides limited evaluation of intrathecal contents, however, contour of thecal sac is within normal limits.
Calcification of the left vertebral artery is noted.
[**11-26**] f/u CT Head w/o Contrast No significant change in appearance of extensive subarachnoid and right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, but with slight increase in surrounding edema and leftward subfalcine herniation.
[**11-27**] f/u CT Head w/o Contrast Slight increase in edema surrounding right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with increased mass effect and leftward subfalcine herniation, especially when compared to original study performed at on [**2190-11-26**].
[**11-28**] CXR Bibasilar opacities.
[**12-1**] CXR 1.
[**12-4**] CT Head w/o Contrast No significant interval change in the large right cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage and extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, with a similar degree of right-to-left subfalcine herniation.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19205**] neurologic exam has been slowly improving/stable per notes and our exam on the floor.
Her serial head CT's have also been stable.
Having said this, they did recommend a repeat CT scan when her coumadin level becomes therapeutic.
# CHF: The patient's ejection fraction is 20% on most recent echocardiogram which is felt due to ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Since her admission, she has been restarted on aspirin, but her plavix is still being held secondary to her intracranial hemorrhage.
# CKD: The patient's creatinine is currently 1, which is improved from baseline.
# Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit continue to improve since her ICU stay.
# FEN: Ms. [**Known lastname 19205**] [**Last Name (Titles) 19206**] demonstrate a likely metabolic alkalosis, but her bicarbonate is stable at 34.
As the patient's speech and swallow study was somewhat confounded by her depressed mental status, her family would like to continue for now with tube feeds.
