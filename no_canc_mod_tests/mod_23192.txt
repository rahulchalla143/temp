CT abdomen: Scans of the upper abdomen show mild intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and massive dilatation of the common bile duct.
Her systolic pressures were in the 70s, but improved to the 90s with crystalloid and IV antibiotics (vanco/cipro/flagyl).
Abdominal source was suspected after CT scan, and labs were consistent.
Numerous stones were retained, and gastroenterology feels she should have repeat ERCP with sphincterotomy and lithotripsy in 2 months.
Blood cultures grew E. coli resistant to floroquinolones.
2. heart murmur -- Given bacteremia, and no previous documented heart murmur, I felt obligated to have an echocardiogram prior to discharge.
Since it was a TTE, if any of her additional blood cultures turn positive, a transesophageal echocardiogram may be warranted, but I think it would be very unlikely she has endocarditis.
