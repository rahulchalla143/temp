CPR was initiated for 3 minutes and patient was given epi and calcium chloride, with spontaneous return of circulation.
Also on [**2156-10-18**] EKG was performed which was remarkable for atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate 155bpm, STE in III, STD in V4-6.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-12-25**], the abnormalities are new and c/w interim ischemia/infarction.
TTE [**2156-10-22**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-10-18**], left ventricular systolic function is now improved (particularly anteroseptal and apical motion).
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2156-8-27**] ST segment elevations in lead III and aVF are new.
s/p cardiac arrest/NSTEMI: There was concern for ACS, given EKG changes and elevated troponin, despite her end-stage renal disease.
Her cardiac enzymes were positive, with her CK-MB peaking at 86 (MB-index 6.5) and troponin up to 8.43.
Echo showed new anterior hypokinesis and global worsening of systolic function.
She was taken to cardiac cath the morning of [**10-19**], showing stenoses in the proximal and mid-LAD, which were thought to be the culprit lesions.

During your admission you had a cardiac catheterization where 2 blockages were discovered in your coronary arteries.
Another complication of your illness was that your dialysis access in your right arm formed a blood clot and is not useable.
