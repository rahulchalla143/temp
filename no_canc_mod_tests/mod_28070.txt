In the ED, CXR was notable for enlarged cardiac sillouette so CTA was obtained.
His VS were stable, HR 80-100, BP 110-120/80's, pulsus of 7, Tmax in ED 100.4.
Social History: immigrated from [**Country 7192**] 11 years ago, not currently working, lives with brother and friends, no ETOH (was drinking [**11-7**] beers/night on weekends), no drug use  Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: T 99.7, HR 80, RR 20, BP 110/60, pulsus 8, O2sat 99%RA GEN: pleasant male, speaking in full sentences, in no distress HEENT: JVP about 8 cm, OP clear, no LAD, EOMI CV: RRR, +systolic murmur best heard at LSB, + rub Lungs: CTA Abd: slight tenderness in LLQ, soft, no rebound, no guarding, normal BS Ext: no edema.
2+ DP/PT pulses bilateral Neuro: A&Ox3, denies suicidal ideation  Pertinent Results: CXR, Pa/L, [**12-5**]: No evidence of pneumothorax or effusion.
CTA chest [**12-5**]: 1.
Echocardiogram (TTE) [**12-6**]//07: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2129-11-7**], the pericardial effusion is now significantly larger.
Echo (TTE) [**2129-12-8**]: Conclusions: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-12-7**], the pericardial effusion is slightly larger; no evidence of cardiac tamponade.
Echo (TTE) [**2129-12-9**]: Conclusions: 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
#) Pericardial effusion: Echo showed large effusion.
Pt'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], TSH were normal.
Repeat echos showed minimal pericardial effusion.
#) Depression: Social work consulted and referred him to [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 70436**] Hispania [**Telephone/Fax (1) 70437**].
