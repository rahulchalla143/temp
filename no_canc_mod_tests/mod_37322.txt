Past Medical History: Cardiac cath [**9-17**]: 1.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right-dominant circulation with single-vessel and branch coronary artery disease.
RA mean was 19 mmHg, PAP was 87/38 mmHg with a mean PA pressure of 59 mmHg.
PCWP was 41 mmHg.
Cardiac output and index were low at 2.7 L/min and 1.35 L/min/m2, respectively.
Initial PA oxygen saturation was 44%.
Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) [**9-17**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20 percent) secondary to severe global hypokinesis with some relative preservation of the basal and midventricular segments of the inferior and posterior walls.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Physical Exam: T97.7 P68 BP 112/51 R21 100% intubated on AC O2 50%/TV 600/ R18/ PEEP 5 PAP 63/25 wedge 22 CVP 11 Thermodilut CO [**4-/2124**] / CI 1.7 SVR 1208 Gen: intubated, sedated, responsive to pain HEENT: intubated, MM moist Neck: no bruits, JVP 12 cm to angle of jaw Resp: crackles at bases CV: RRR, nl s1/s2.

LE A-gram [**2177-11-21**] IMPRESSION: 1) Aortogram with right lower extremity runoff performed.
Echo [**2177-11-26**] Conclusions:  EF 20% The left atrium is dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2177-9-15**], tricuspid regurgiation peak gradient is now higher.
He underwent lower extremity angiography which revealed proximal superficial femoral artery stenosis, and distal superficial femoral artery stenosis.
A swan Ganz catheter and central line were placed, which showed CO 3.0, CI 1.5, and wedge around 25.
After the patient's foley was readjusted, he began to make about 1-2 liters of urine output per day.
2) CAD - The patient had an anterior [**Hospital1 **] with cardiac catheterization and Cypher stenting in [**9-17**].
His troponins were elevated to 0.25 during hospitalization which were likely due to renal failure.
