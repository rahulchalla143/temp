He was taken to [**Hospital1 8**] where a CT showed bleed and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
In ED initial vitals, T 102.8, BP 124/84, HR 16, O2 sat 97% 2L NC.
CT scan was repeated showing an intraparenchymal bleed L>R and epidural bleed of R occipital region.

Normal CT angiography of the head for stenosis or occlusion.
If clinically indicated a CT venography of the head can be obtained.
[**2184-9-24**] CT C spine 1.
Right occipital fracture, refer to CT head report from same date 4.
CXR [**2184-9-24**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Dedicated PA and lateral views of the chest are recommended when the patient is in stable condition.
Repeat CT head [**9-25**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Repeat CT Head showed likely stable blood, redistribution, but no new acute bleed.
Will followup with neurosurgery/Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**10-28**] at which time he will also have repeat CT of head (noncontrast) for resolution.
Stable on regimen of NaCl tabs (3gm tid with meals) and lasix 20mg daily, which has kept serum sodium between 126 and 130 for over a week.
Should have sodium checked at least twice a week; we expect this to resolve as ICH resorbs and brain parenchyma heals.
# Aspiration pneumonia- Retrocardiac opacity on initial CXR was thought most likely aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with a full course of antibiotics.
# Chronic Pleural Effusions s/p VATS and decortication - unclear if CXR change from baseline.
EtOH level negative on presentation,  # Atrial Fibrillation - holding ASA as above, will restart per Neurosurgery recs on/after [**10-21**].
Sodium Chloride 1 gram Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO TID W/MEALS (3 TIMES A DAY WITH MEALS).
Seizure 5. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 6. diastolic congestive heart failure 7. pulmonary hypertension 8. chronic pleural effusion 9. adenocarcinoma of esophagus s/p chemo and radiation therapy 10.
The CT from [**Hospital1 8**] and [**Hospital1 18**] showed that you have some bleeding in your brain as well as non-displaced fracture in the base of your skull.
Neurosurgeon (Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) evaluated you and thought that you do not need operation.
Neurology team examined you and recommended the medication (Dilantin) for seizure prevention and we titrated the dose and measure your blood level of medication which was improving.
The repeated CT of your head showed no additional acute bleed.
Series of chest x-ray showed chronic fluid in your lung which has worsened with aspiration.
Be sure to sit up straight while eating, and soft/ground consistency foods will be easier to eat than solids.
You experienced low blood pressure and change in mental status in setting of dehydration and low sodium (from [**Date range (1) 80335**], sodium has been stable between 126 and 130).
An ulcer was seen in the distal esophagus, so you will need to take lansoprazole twice a day for 4 weeks and then have a repeat endoscopy with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4539**] to make sure this is resolving.
