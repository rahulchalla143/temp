His first set of cardiac enzymes at the outside hospital were negative.
The patient had a recent admissions for congestive heart failure the first being secondary to ICD firing and stent restenosis status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and hemodialysis and the second being for flash pulmonary edema on [**8-21**] and cardiac catheterization was negative for new lesion at that time.
Factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] heterozygous on Coumadin goal INR 1.3 to 1.5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission to the MICU were temperature 97.2.
Blood pressure 116/53.
Pulse 80.
Respirations 20.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 12.7, hematocrit 34.3, platelets 270, D-dimer 1157, CK 11, MB of 2, troponin T 0.02.
Outside hospital CK was 15, troponin T was 0.025.
Potassium 5.5, creatinine of 7.3, BUN 68.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45%, mild pulmonary hypertension.
Chest x-ray showed stable cardiac enlargement, upper zone redistribution without overt pulmonary edema, persistent left lower lobe opacity (pneumonia versus atelectasis).
CTA showed bibasilar atelectasis, resolution of bilateral pleural effusions and diffuse ground glass opacities, residual thickening reflex, residual mild pulmonary edema, no PE.
Urinalysis was positive for nitrites, greater then 300 protein, large blood, moderate leukocytes, 21 to 50 red blood cells, greater then 50 white blood cells and occasional bacteria.
PT 14.4, INR 1.4, and PTT 31.6.
Pleuritic chest pain:  The patient is admitted with pleuritic chest pain.
He has cardiac enzymes negative times three for an myocardial infarction.
CTA was negative for PE and echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of 45%, mildly depressed left ventricular function, mildly thickened aortic valve and mitral valve, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, no effusion.
A repeat echocardiogram was done to rule out new effusion.
No change from prior study from the day before.
Hypotension:  In the Emergency Department the patient became hypotensive to a systolic blood pressures of 83 and he was started on a Dopamine drip and a right IJ was placed and intravenous fluids were given.
His systolic blood pressure increased to the 90s to 100s and Dopamine was discontinued.
His hypotension resolved and he was transferred the next day to the regular cardiac floor.
In addition the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells during hemodialysis for a drop in his hematocrit, however, his blood pressure remained stable.
Two sets of blood cultures were negative.
Urine cultures were positive for coag negative staph.
Chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia.
Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit dropped from 34.3 to 29.6 and he received 1 unit of packed red blood cells during dialysis.
An outpatient colonoscopy is recommended for further evaluation.
Anticoagulation:  The patient was kept on Coumadin for a factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], goal INR 1.3 to 1.5.
The patient will be followed as an outpatient and his blood pressure will be monitored by home nursing aids.
Loose stools:  The patient had multiple episodes of loose stools and C-difficile culture was sent and it was negative.
FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow up with [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 27881**], RN-[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 27882**] from cardiology on [**9-12**].
Follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**] on [**2136-9-26**], earlier if his systolic blood pressures are greater then 140 or less then 100.
