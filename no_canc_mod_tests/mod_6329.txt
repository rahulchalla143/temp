Cardiac catheterization revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20, a right atrial pressure of 15 and 17, with a mean of 12, right ventricular pressures of 42 and 9, pulmonary artery pressure of 40 and 16, with a mean of 28.
Cardiac output was 3.97.
Cardiac index was 2.2.
Post stent electrocardiogram showed 2-mm to 3-mm ST elevations in V2 through V5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On physical examination the patient was afebrile, blood pressure was 131/84, heart rate was 60, respiratory rate was 20, and oxygen saturation was 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

Creatine kinase was 257.
Troponin was 2.5.
Her troponin levels were found to be greater than 50.
The patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 45% with mid-to-distal anteroseptal hypokinesis/akinesis, also with apical akinesis.
A chest x-ray showed no infiltrate and no congestive heart failure.
The patient remained stable throughout her hospital course with a stable blood pressure and no events on telemetry.
The patient was continued on a heparin drip until her INR reached 1.9, at which point the heparin drip was stopped.
The patient was instructed to follow up on her INR and her hematocrit on [**4-28**].
The patient also agreed to participate in a study involving a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation and was to undergo a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging either on the day of discharge or the following day.
MAJOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  Cardiac catheterization with angioplasty and stent placement.
(adjust dose as per cardiologist for a goal INR of 2 to 3).
