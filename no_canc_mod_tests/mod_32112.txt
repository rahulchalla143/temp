Prenatal laboratory studies included blood type B positive, antibody negative, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, Rubella immune and group B strep negative.
This pregnancy was complicated by a diagnosis of complex congenital haert disease at approximately 18 weeks gestation with fetal echocardiogram at that time showing unbalanced atrioventricular canal defect with hypoplastic left ventricle, aortic arch hypoplasia and a large atrial septal defect.
Repeat fetal echocardiogram at 32 weeks confirmed these findings with the overall anatomy thought to be consistent with a functionally single ventricle physiology.
Fetal ultrasound was otherwise unremarkable.
Quad screen was performed which showed a low risk of Trisomy.
Initial heart rates were approximately 40.
Apgar scores were 3 and 8 and infant was brought to the NICU.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight was 2.45 kg, weight was 45.5 cm, head circumference was 33.5 cm.
Vital signs revealed temperature of 97.8, heart rate in the 120's, respiratory rate 40 to 60's, blood pressure of 55-60/35-44, with similar blood pressures in the upper and lower extremities, and oxygen saturations of 78 to 80% in room air, both preductally and post ductally.
HEENT: Revealed soft and flat fontanels, normal ears and nares, intact palate and a present red reflex bilaterally.
Chest was clear to auscultation with moderate aeration and mild retractions.
Heart exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm.
Femoral pulses were 2+ and symmetric.
Oxygen saturations remained 75 to 80% in room air.
Blood sugar was 75 prior to IV fluids.
