Colonoscopy [**2112-3-9**]: Blood in ileum, Diverticulosis of the ascending colon, Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, Fresh red blood throughout colon.
Gastric Biopsies, [**2112-3-9**]: Pending .
Meckel's Scan [**2112-3-10**]: Flow images were obtained over the abdomen and pelvis in the anterior and posterior projections.
Dynamic images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained for 30 minutes in the anterior and posterior projections.
Based on colonoscopy findings from [**Hospital3 3583**], her bleeding was felt to be most likely due to intermittently bleeding diverticulum.
HCT was stable at 26.
Her heart rate increased to 100s-110s and her SBP dropped to the 100s.
HCT increased to 28.6 and subsequently remained stable.
She underwent a tagged red blood scan on [**3-8**] which showed no bleeding during 3 hours of evaluation.
GI was consulted and performed an EGD / colonoscopy on [**3-9**].
EGD showed evidence for duodenitis and severe segmental gastritis.
Colonoscopy showed fresh blood in the ileum, diverticulosis of the ascending and sigmoid colon, and fresh blood throughout the colon.
These findings suggested a small bowel source of the bleed, and a Meckel's scan was recommended to search for a Meckel's diverticulum.
FLOOR COURSE: The patient was transferred to the floor after her hematocrit was stable x 48 hours and she remained hemodynamically stable.
The patient's bleeding had subsided and her hematocrits remained stable.
It was thought that her right sided diverticulum was still the most likely cause of her bleeding.
# Mild transaminitis: This was reported by OSH labs with AST 45, ALT 50, and Alk Phos 82.
Lab Tests Please get a CBC checked on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**3-14**] to ensure that your hematocrit is stable.
Your GI bleed was most likely a lower source from the diverticulosis in your colon.
Your workup included the following: A colonoscopy showed diverticuli in the ascending and sigmoid colon with red blood in the colon, an EGD showed only mild gastritis of the stomach (not likely be a bleeding source).
A bleeding scan was negative for bleeding source, and a Meckel's scan was negative for a bleeding Meckel's diverticulum.
Finally, a small bowel enteroscopy showed no evidence of an upper bleeding source to as far as the proximal ileum.
You are scheduled to see a primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 766**] to get your hematocrit checked to ensure there is no further blood loss.
Followup Instructions: Please followup with the [**Hospital3 **] at [**Hospital1 18**] to ensure your hematocrit is stable after your bleeding episode.
Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 19779**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**] Date/Time:[**2112-3-14**] 12:10.
When you return to [**State **], you will need to establish care with a gastroenterologist for further monitoring and care.
