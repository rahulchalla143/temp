The VT therapy equals anti-tachy pacing followed by 5 shocks between 20 and 35 joules, fast VT therapy equals anti-tachy pacing followed by 5 shocks between 20 and 35 joules, whereas the VF therapy equals anti-tachy pacing during charging followed by 6 shocks between 24 and 25 joules  His device is programmed to treat rates greater than 150 bpm inthe VT zone, rates greater than 188 bpm in the VF zone.
Initial EKG showed sinus rhythm, rate 57, normal axis with old inferior and high lateral TWI with several PVC of right bundle, superior axis morphology.
Cardiology interrogated ICD, which revealed 255 episodes of fast VT (>188BPM) since last interrogated, 244 pace terminated episodes (ATP), 11 shock terminated episodes (20J then 30J if refractory).
CXR showed AICD in place with no acute process.

[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2096-1-26**], left ventricular systolic function has deteriorated.
-CXR ([**2101-1-26**]) - No acute chest pathology; there is no radiographic evidence for pulmonary edema.
-CXR ([**2101-1-27**]) - NGT ends in the fundus of a moderately to severely distended stomach.
Lung volumes are low exaggerating heart size, probably top normal.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease s/p inferior myocardial infarction, infarct-related cardiomyopathy with LVEF 25-30% and [**Company 1543**] ICD implantation in [**2096**] for primary prevention who presents to the emergency department with non-specific symptoms found to have intermittent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with appropriate ICD shock.
For bridging, he was initially on a heparin gtt which was transitioned to Lovenox 100mg sc q12h, which he will continue until his INR is therapeutic.
He had projectile bilious vomiting and a KIB showed significant gastric dilation.
An NGT was placed again this admission and his symptoms improved.
His abdominal exam remained benign with no tenderness to palpation.
The tube was removed after 48 hours when his KUB showed resolving gastric dilation.
# CAD - He did not have any complaints of chest pain and his cardiac enzymes were negative.
#Transitional issues - Will continue on Lovenox 100mg sc q12h until INR is therapeutic - Started on coumadin with subtherapeutic INR at discharge, will have INR checked on Tuesday [**2101-2-1**] - Atenolol was changed to metoprolol during this admission - Should follow-up with the device clinic after discharge, will need to call for the appointment as he was discharged on a weekend.

Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR given patient's need for anticoagulation.
You had a VT ablation and did not have any further episodes of VT afterwards.
You should have your INR checked on Tuesday.
