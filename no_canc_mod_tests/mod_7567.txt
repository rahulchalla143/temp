IMAGING: [**5-20**] CXR 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and hypokinesis of the interventricular septum.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-4-9**], there has been marked progression of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (both of the functional ischemic classification) consistent with the natural history of this patient's recently documented untreated extensive inferior posterior and right ventricular myocardial infarction.
ACTIVE # GI Bleed: Patient w h/o errosive gastritis on EGD [**2-/2131**], who presented w downtrending HCT (30 to 20.9), guaiac + stool.
Patient received 3 units pRBCs w stabilization of Hct in low 30s.
HCT stabilized (>48 hours) without invasive intervention and GI service opted not to scope.
TTE demonstrated LVEF 25%, 4+MR.
Heparin antibody was negative in prior admission.
Barriers to Care: Recurrent GI bleeds have had major effect on patient management (rehospitalizations, inability to manage STEMI w cath), and may necessitate recurrent transfusions or future readmissions  Medications on Admission: acetaminophen 650 mg/20.3 mL Oral Soln Q6H PRN albuterol sulfate HFA 90 mcg 6 puffs Q6-8 hrs PRN amiodarone 400 mg daily ascorbic acid 500 mg daily atorvastatin 80 mg Daily Chlorhexedine 0.12% 12mL Q12H Diphenhydramine 25mg Q4H PRN itching Diphenhydramine cream 1appl Q8H PRN Docusate 100mg [**Hospital1 **] Glucerna 1.2 tube feed 75ml/H furosemide 80 mg IV BID collnaagese clostridium histolyticum 250 unit/g Ointment Topical [**Hospital1 **] insulin glargine 14 QHS insulin regular Sliding scale Ipratropium/Albuterol 3mL Q2H PRN Lorazepam 1mg Q8H PRN metoprolol tartrate 75 mg Q8H pantoprazole 40 mg IV BID sucralfate 1 gram 4x daily Polyethylene glycol 17g daily free water 200cc Q6H  Discharge Medications: 1. amiodarone 200 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
You were transfused with red blood cells.
Your blood levels returned to [**Location 213**] levels, and remained stable for 3 days.
We discussed your care with gastroenterologists who felt that you did not need to have an endoscopy as long as your blood levels remained stable.
