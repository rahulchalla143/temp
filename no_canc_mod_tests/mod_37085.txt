In mid [**Month (only) **], she developed hypotension and creatinine started to rise rapidly.
Pulse 66.
Blood pressure 144/65.
Vent settings, pressure support of 5, total volume 700, rate 12, PEEP of 5, FIO2 30%.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 143, potassium 3.8, chloride 103, bicarbonate 20, BUN 126, creatinine 7.5, glucose 83, calcium 10.6, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 2.4, PT 14, INR 1.3, PTT 94.
White blood cell count 7.
Hematocrit 28.6 and platelets 146,000.
Urinalysis greater than 300 protein, [**5-14**] white blood cells and specific gravity of 1.015.
Abdominal CT at the time showed no retroperitoneal bleed, but there was a large hematoma surrounding the Quinton.
She was transfused with five units of packed red blood cells to raise her hematocrit and subsequently given two more units of packed red blood cells that went into the hematoma.
Patient's hematoma then stabilized on the [**5-28**] with a tense hematoma at the site of the Quinton catheter, approximately 10 cm in diameter and the total hematoma was 25 x 25 cm.
