Emergency Medical Service found him and documented a heart rate of 20 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 90/palpable.
In the Emergency Department, the patient's vital signs revealed a heart rate of 36 with a blood pressure of 66/40.
He was continued on the dopamine drip with an improvement in his heart rate to the 40s to 50s.
Shortly thereafter, the patient's heart rate began to decrease to the 20s.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Before intubation, the patient denied chest pain, cough, fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
An echocardiogram in [**2175-5-6**] disclosed an ejection fraction of 40% with no wall motion abnormalities.
A stress test in [**2175-5-6**] disclosed regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but no reversible defects.
Cardiac catheterization revealed there was moderate left and mild right ventricular diastolic function, there was mild focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction, there was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension, there was a left-sided superior vena cava.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  General physical examination revealed an obese male lying in bed with face mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Heart examination revealed bradycardia in the 40s.
Extremity examination revealed 1+ lower extremity edema.
Neurologic examination evaluated alert and oriented times three.
Examination was otherwise nonfocal.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data revealed white blood cell count was 9.7, hematocrit was 33.7, and platelet count was 204.
Chemistries were significant for a potassium of 6.6, blood urea nitrogen was 54, and creatinine was 1.9.
Magnesium was 2.2.
Creatine kinase was 341.
A toxicology screen was negative.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema.
Electrocardiogram revealed a heart rate in the 40s, a junctional rhythm versus atrial fibrillation, with low rate.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 57-year-old male with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sarcoidosis, and hypercholesterolemia status post a syncopal episode with a heart rate initially in the 20s and an electrocardiogram consistent with probable junctional rhythm.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was maintained on a dopamine drip to maintain his heart rate and blood pressure.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out an ischemic event, and they peaked with a creatine kinase of 348.
Cardiac troponin was 0.9.
His heart rate was atrioventricularly paced in the 80s, and his blood pressure was stable off of dopamine.
An echocardiogram with contrast was performed.
The left ventricular wall thickness was normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed.
Reduced ejection fraction of 45% to 50%.
