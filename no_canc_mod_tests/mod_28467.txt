# Hypoxia/multifocal pneumonia/gram positive cocci bactermia: The patient's presentation of fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia along with the CXR showing a multifocal PNA point towards a lung infection as his underlying process.
Blood cultures grew out gram postive cocci, later speciated to pansensitive strep pneumo.
ID was consulted and recommended starting steroids, even though PCP was less likely until sputum culture ruled out PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] he steroids were discontinued when strep pneumo was speciated from the blood.
Once the blood cultures came back his antibiotics were tailored to CTX only.
# Hepatocellular injury:  Patient with acutely elevated bilirubin and INR with a moderate transaminitis.
Abdominal ultrasound was consistent with acute hepatitis.
Several viral serologies, acute hepatitis serologies, autoimmune workup, and iron studies/ceroplasmin were sent for additional workup and did not reveal any cause of liver injury.
# HIV/AIDS: Last CD4 count in [**3-20**] was 257.
A CMV was also checked and returned with CMV IgG positive, but viral load was negative.
# Hyponatremia: Patient was initally hyponatremic with a Na of 120 which improved with volume resuscitation.
You were admitted with cough and jaundice and found out to have a pneumococcal pneumonia, as well as positive blood cultures for strep pneumoniae.
We checked your CD4 count and it came back at 123, so you were continued on a prophylactic dose of bactrim for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
You will need to have labs drawn in 1 week after your discharge.
