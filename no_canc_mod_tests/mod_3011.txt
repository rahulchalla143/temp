EKG signficant for complete heart block with excape at a rate of 20-30bpm.
Labs signficant for Trop-T: 8.13, kidney failure with Cr at 4.7(baseline from [**2100**] at 1.1), phos-4.7, K-4.9, NA-132, and elevated WBC to 13.24 (80%N, no bands) and a relatively negative CXR.
A CXR was obtained demonstarting good positioning of corditis without complication.
Prior to transfer vitals were P-80 BP-89/56, 97% on 2L.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF = 45%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and to pacemaker-induced dyssynchrony.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2099-7-6**], the following findings are new: (1) pacemaker wire now seen in RA/RV, entering and probably perforating RV free wall (2) small pericardial effusion now seen subtending area where pacemaker wire tip seen (no sign of cardiac tamponade) (3) pacemaker-induced LV dyssynchrony is now present (4) inferior posterior wall hypokinesis now present (5) RV is now dilated and hypocontractile .
# Complete Heart Block - Etiology [**3-8**] a recent MI given elevated trop to 8 with inferior q-waves on EKG leading to complete heart block.
PA/LAT CXR showed appropriate positioning.
ECHO showed EF 45%.
We started medical management with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325, Atorva 80, Metop XL 25, Echo showed inferior posterior wall hypokinesis, and EF 45%.
