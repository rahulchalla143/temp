Her electrocardiogram showed ST elevations anteriorly as well as some ectopy and a questionable junctional rhythm after reperfusion with the lytic therapy.
At the [**Hospital1 69**], her electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in leads V1 through V4 as well as I and aVL.
The catheterization showed:  1) Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
2)  Resting hemodynamics showed normal pulmonary and central aortic pressures with mildly elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
3)  Left ventriculography showed anterior hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 49%.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow.
Hypercholesterolemia with an increased HDL fraction, numbers unknown at present.
Calcium 1200 and Vitamin D.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works at [**Company 51642**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 132/71, heart rate 68, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 99% on two liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat reveals moist mucous membranes.
Pulmonary is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis and radial pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Chem7 showed sodium 139, potassium 2.8, chloride 102, bicarbonate 18, blood urea nitrogen 27, creatinine 0.9, glucose 210.
CK was 79, troponin 0.07.
Electrocardiogram - see history of present illness.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2147-7-8**], the patient was status post reperfusion and stenting of the left anterior descending and was monitored on telemetry in the Coronary Care Unit.
On [**2147-7-8**], the night prior the patient had dropped her systolic blood pressure to the 70s with the heart rate in the 40s.
Her CK was at 147, MB at 18, troponin greater than 50.
Chest x-ray from the outside hospital showed no cardiopulmonary processes, no cardiomegaly, no infiltrates.
Her potassium after repletion was at 4.2.
Her hematocrit went from 39.1 to 35.3.
The patient remained asymptomatic and her oxygen saturation was at 99% in room air.
The patient's Atorvastatin was switched to Fluvastatin due to the interaction recently noted between Plavix and Atorvastatin (please see the article by [**Doctor Last Name **], et [**Doctor Last Name **] in the [**1-17**] edition of circulation [**2147**], pages 32 to 37).
[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 51644**], for a check of her creatinine and liver function tests within the month.
