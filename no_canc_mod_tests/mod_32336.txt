URINE CULTURE (Final [**2108-10-10**]): ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Positive UA and CT showed perinephric stranding.
Abdominal pain: Dilated colon on CXR and Abd CT.
CT scan did not show evidence of obstruction, and was only remarkable for perinephric stranding.
He had a gallbladder ultrasound which was followed by a HIDA which was unremarkable.
He was seen by the surgical consult service for evaluation for bowel ischemia, and was felt not to have ischemic bowel.
The metoprolol was restarted once his blood pressures improved.
The lisinopril should be held until a repeat creatinine is checked, and continued to trend downward.
ARF likely related to sepsis and hypoperfusion [**3-17**] hypovolemia: baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently elevated at 2.0 but trending downward.
He was not restarted on his lisinopril given his labile creatinine, but this should be restarted once his creatinine is rechecked in one week, and is back to baseline.
Hypoglycemia: Patient had blood sugars intermittently as low as 23 on admission.
His blood sugars will need to be monitored closely.
HIT antibody sent off and is negative.
Heparin was discontinued initially, but then restarted once his platelet count returned to [**Location 213**].

Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 41354**] 5415  You will need to have a repeat creatinine checked in 7 days to ensure that the number is improving.
