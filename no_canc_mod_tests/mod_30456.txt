The cardiac silhouette has actually decreased significantly in size from the prior exam suggesting a resolved pericardial effusion.
Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
[**2129-2-12**] CXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph from [**3-14**], the signs of bilateral diffuse pulmonary edema have completely resolved.
[**2129-2-14**] ECHO The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-11-18**], global left ventricular systolic function is slightly less vigorous.
On his first night in the MICU, his blood pressure decrased approximately 20% on nitro drip and enalapril IV; diastolic stable at 100.
In fact, his blood pressure was borderline low on less medications than he reportedly takes at home raising the question of noncompliance as an outpatient.
He received an ECHO, which was unrevealing and had no wall motion abnormalities.
Repeat EKG had persistent depressions and unclear as to the underlying cause, but ECHO was negative.
Pt was empirically started on vanc/zosyn that was later removed and his white count trended down without Abx.
He remained afebrile and no further workup was done.
There was initial concern that this pain, was different and new, but after speaking with the patient, he said it was the same pain and did not want further imaging since all CT scanning has come back negative.
