He underwent a CT abd without contrast (due to ARF) there which did not reveal an acute process.
Due to his high pain levels, ARF and enlarged mediastinum on CXR he was sent here for MRI due to concern for aortic dissection.
ECG was noted to be unremarkable with negative MB and trop.
AP CXR in our ED, fairly poor study due to body habitus, did suggest a LLL.
OSH d-dimer reported as WNL.
VS at time of transfer were: Afebrile 89/50 96% on NRB 18 HR 97  .
BPs 110/70 b/l Abdomen: Obese, mildly tense.
Guaiac - in ED.

Echo - The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
While non-contrast evaluation of the aorta is unremarkable, evaluation for dissection is limited without contrast.
[**2185-1-8**] - chest x-ray IMPRESSION: While atelectasis may represent a componet of the bibasilar opacity, pneumonia cannot be excluded; particularly on the left.
[**2185-1-10**] Renal U/S 1.
Blood flow demonstrated to the right, equivocal on the left, although this may be technical in etiology.
Will continue abx outpatient, sputum and blood cultures pending.
Day #1 post discharge- pts blood cultures 2/4 were positive for Gram positive rods (cornebacterium and propiobacterium).
Lipase normal, pancreas normal on CT non-contrast, guaiac negative so less concerned for PUD/diverticulitis.
D-dimer elevated which is concerning for PE but pain and oxygenation has greatly improved and LENI negative as noted above.
TTE was negative for effusion.
Renal ultrasound was normal making post renal obstruction and renal artery dissection less likely.
His pressures improved from original hypotensive state on admission.
Based on your history, your physical exam and several differnt laboratory and imaging studies it seems most likely you had a pneumonia, a lung infection.
Based on the studies we performed, we know you have had [**Last Name **] problem with you heart, and it is very unlikely you had a blood clot to your lungs.
