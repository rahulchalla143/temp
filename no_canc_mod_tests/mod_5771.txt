Approximately one month prior to admission to the outside hospital on [**2179-2-21**], the patient had undergone a prostate biopsy for a nodule.
MRI revealed increased T2 signal disc T9-T10, CT guided bx revealed no evidence of malignancy or infection, and cultures were negative.
Initial blood cultures were negative, but on fourth day 1 bottle grew enterococcus Patient had initially been treated with levofloxacin, then was changed to vancomycin when enterococcus grew from culture.
At the outside hospital the patient was also found to be in renal failure with creatinine 2.5. .
Evaluation at outside hospital: - Abdominal CT without contrast: no AAA, extensive degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine - Bone scan [**2-19**]: DJD - MRI; enhancement of the T9-10 disk, suspicious for diskitis - CK normal (concern for possible rhabdomyolysis after recent statin use) - Renal U/S (limited exam)-2.6cm parapelvic cyst at upper pole of R kidney.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Gen: Elderly male, appears to be in pain VS: 98.4 / 90 / 128/57 / 22 / 100% on 2L nc HEENT: Sclera anicteric, conjunctiva pink.
Sensation to light touch intact bilat LE.
Pertinent Results: Blood cultures negative x4 Urine culture negative .
MRI of T Spine [**2179-3-1**]: Signal within the disc space on the T2- and STIR-weighted sequences at T9-10 consistent with discitis at this level.
MRI of L Spine [**2179-3-3**]: There is a focus of abnormal signal intensity in the left anterior aspect of the L4/5 disk and a small area of diskitis cannot be completely excluded, although the typical soft tissue and marrow abnormalities are absent.
There is severe stenosis of the spinal canal at L5/S1 from a disk bulge, disk space and facet osteophytes and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.
MRI shows enhancement of T9-10 disk space, T4-5 space, and severe stenosis at L5-S1.
FNA of T9-10 negative for organisms, PMNs, malignant cells.
Enterococcus grew from 1/4 bottles on blood cx at OSH, but all subsequent cultures have been negative to date.
Back Pain and Weakness: MRI of T spine at [**Hospital3 1280**] had revealed abnormal enhancement of the T9-10 disk space, consistent with diskitis.
However, the patient reported that MRI of L spine showed severe stenosis at L5-S1, the level of the patient's back pain.
Diskitis/bacteremia: At [**Hospital3 1280**], 1 of 4 bottles from a blood culture grew enterococcus after several days.
No blood cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] grew organisims.
1 month before that was complicated by a UTI, so there was also concern for gram negative source of diskitis.
An abdominal CT was also performed, which ruled-out abscess.
On gram stain from the OR, there were no organisms, 2+ PMNs.
Anemia: Baseline HCT from [**11-14**] was 37.6.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
LBBB on EKG unchanged from previous studies.
