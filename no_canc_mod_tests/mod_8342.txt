Admission Date: [**2156-5-31**]        Discharge Date: [**2156-6-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2132-1-9**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 24-year-old male with type 1 diabetes complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and end- stage renal disease currently on peritoneal dialysis, systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 15 percent as of [**2155-12-1**], hypertension, grade 2 esophagitis and multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis in the past, was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis.
His last ejection fraction in [**2155-12-1**] was 15 percent.
In the Emergency Department, the patient's blood pressure was 209/123, pulse 98, respirating 18, and 95 percent on a nonrebreather.
In the Emergency Department, the patient's glucose is 611 with an anion gap of 22.
His cardiac enzymes are elevated with a CPK of 440 and a troponin-T of 0.51.
In addition, he had increased LFTs with an ALT of 899 and AST of 1650.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical exam as per MICU admitting team:  Temperature 97.6, pulse of 98, blood pressure 155/108, respiratory rate of 102, and 100 percent on nonrebreather.
Examination is significant for young thin white male, who appears anxious with moderate respiratory distress.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation without rales or wheezes.
LABORATORIES:  White count 11, hematocrit 35.2, platelets 514, neutrophils 83.
K 4.4, creatinine 9.5, BUN 55, anion gap 22.
INR 1.6.
X-RAY:  Chest x-ray with stable cardiomegaly, normal pulmonary vasculature with no pneumonia or fluid overload.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed patent vessels, small amount of free intraperitoneal fluid, prominent gallbladder filled with sludge without evidence of cholecystitis and a right sided pleural effusion.
Although initial chest x-ray did not reveal CHF, it is likely that patient developed CHF in the setting of his lower ejection fraction of 15 percent.
Transaminitis:  It is unclear of why the patient had elevated amylase and lipase on admission.
Hepatic serologies were negative except for a positive hepatitis A antibody.
Hypoglycemia:  The patient had an episode of hypoglycemia, at which time his fingersticks were in the 40s.
ID:  On admission, the patient had a questionable opacity on his right lower lobe on chest x-ray, however, this was a limited exam because it was a portable.
Multiple A-P views did not reveal any infiltrate.
The patient remained afebrile until a few days prior to discharge at which time his white blood cell count slightly increased and he had temperatures greater than 101.5.
There were three  sets of blood cultures that are pending upon discharge.
A urine culture was negative with less than 10,000 CFUs.
A peritoneal dialysate fluid showed 1 white blood cell, 1 red blood cell, 36 polys, 28 percent lymphocytes, 26 percent monocytes, and 10 percent mesothelial cells.
The white count the day before discharge had increased to 15.9 with 87 percent neutrophils and 7 percent lymphocytes.
According to the Renal consult less than 100 white blood cells would be within normal limits.
A left lower extremity ultrasound did not reveal a DVT.
Patient had an area of firmness, erythema, and swelling on his left calf just below his popliteal fossa.
The patient's pulses were always palpable.
A MRI of the lower extremity revealed diffuse abnormal enhancement most pronounced in the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle.
Given the concern of diabetic necrosis, the patient's CPK trended downward after the initial demand ischemia.
He had an increasing white blood cell count and he continued to have high temperatures without a known source.
On the day that the patient did sign out against medical advice, he had multiple discussions with the different consulting and primary team about his medical care and agreed to stay and allow blood draws and to take his medications.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Erratic serum glucose, white blood cell count greater than 15, and temperatures greater than 101.5.
