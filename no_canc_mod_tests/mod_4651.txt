TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast CT imaging of the brain.
Comparison is made to a prior study from [**2180-8-6**].
Areas of encephalomalacia within the parietooccipital region on the right appears to have progressed when compared to the prior examination of [**2180-8-6**].
An MRI/MRA would be helpful in evaluating for acute infarction in this setting if clinically warranted.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis performed after the intravenous administration of 150 cc of Optiray.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The visualized portions of the lung bases are clear.
The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are within normal limits.
There is an 8 mm rounded low-attenuation lesion within the mid- pole of the left kidney that cannot be further characterized on this study performed with a single phase of contrast enhancement that likely represents a simple renal cyst.
Several prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen in the aortocaval region seen best on series 3, image 24, measuring 1.7 x 0.6 mm.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is in place within the urinary bladder.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Normal wave forms, color flow, augmentation, and compressibility were demonstrated in all these veins.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
ABNORMALITY #2: A relative paucity of theta rhythms were seen at  times from the right temporal region in comparison with the left.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is normal in size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Conclusions: 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
On biPAP 7/6 for persistent hypercarbia post extubation; weaned off [**7-17**].
The patient had extensive work-up for her altered mental status, including a lumbar puncture, head CT, and EEG.
The patient could not have an MRI due to her pacemaker.
Lumbar puncture did not show evidence of meningitis.
EEG did not s how obvious epileptiform activity.
Review of CT head imaging disclosed evidence for bilateral thalamic strokes, likely secondary to emboli (given pt's atrial fibrillation).
3) Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and sick sinus syndrome, s/p pacemaker placement.
ECHO on [**7-17**] was negative for clot.
Ultrasound of R UE on [**7-23**] wsa negative for clot.
