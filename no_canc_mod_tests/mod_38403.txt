Blood Culture, Routine (Pending): PENDING  [**2163-8-17**] 7:15 pm MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab.
Global left ventricular systolic function is probably normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
CXR [**2163-8-18**]: Appropriately positioned right subclavian line.
RLE Ultrasound [**2163-8-17**]:  Limited study as described above without DVT in the right common femoral and proximal superficial femoral vein.
ECG [**2163-8-17**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Urosepsis / Hypotension: Patient admitted with hypotension with SBP 70s, in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR and with UA suggestive of UTI.
SBP rose to the 90-110s.
His urine culture grew Proteus sensitive to all cephalosporins and his antibiotics were changed to cefpodoxime for a total 10 day course.
His blood pressure remained very sensitive to beta blockade, and his metoprolol was not restarted.
Digoxin level was checkced and was 1.7 on the day of discharge.
Acute on chronic renal failure: He was admitted with Cr 2.5 from baseline creatinine of 1.5 which was felt to be pre-renal in etiology in the setting of urosepsis.
Creatinine improved with IV fluid resuscitation.
Once urinary output improved, potassium returned to [**Location 213**] value.
His long-acting NPH was held as he did not initially have oral intake.
His blood sugars ranged 80-250 while in the hospital, although started to trend up to high 100's by the time of discharge.
RLE swelling: He had LENIs negative for DVT.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Continue cefpodoxime x 5 more days (end date [**2163-8-27**]) - Blood cultures from admission still pending - Recommend wound care evaluation after discharge for bilateral lower extremity wounds.
- Monitor blood sugars closely, likely will need to restart NPH in next 1-2 days - Follow heart rate, may need metoprolol added back slowly - Health care proxy [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 57492**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91649**](c), RN [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] at The Stone House ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 91650**] - Code status: DNR/DNI  Medications on Admission: allopurinol 100 mg daily aspirin EC 325 mg daily citalopram 20 mg daily cranberry oral tablet 450 mg 2 tablets [**Hospital1 **] (?1 tablet [**Hospital1 **]) furosemide 40 mg daily at 5 p.m. furosemide 80 mg daily at 8 a.m. Novolin N 18 units SQ QAM Novolin R sliding scale Os-Cal 500+D 500-200 mg-unit [**Unit Number **] tablet PO BID potassium chloride CR 20 mEq PO daily prednisone taper (currently on 10 mg daily) omeprazole 20 mg daily Toprol XL 50 mg daily Tylenol simvastatin 40 mg daily Benadryl Allergy 25 mg Q6H:PRN itching Dulcolax 10 mg PR PRN Fleet enema PRN Imodium 2 mg Q8H PRN Milk of magnesia 30 mL PRN nitro SL 0.4 mg PRN Robitussin maximum strength 10 mL Q4H:PRN Vicodin 5-500 1 tablet Q6H PRN   Discharge Medications: 1. allopurinol 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
