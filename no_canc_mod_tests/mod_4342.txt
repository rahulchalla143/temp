His discriminatory function measured 50s, bicarbonate measured 15, anion gap 32, lactic acid 15.5.
He was also noted to have troponin 3.3 with flat creatinine kinase, no acute process was noted on the electrocardiogram.
His urinalysis showed white blood cells 10 with a few bacteria.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the floor temperature maximum was 100.6, temperature 97.4, respiratory rate 19, 94% on room air, blood pressure 100/56, pulse 71.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission to hospital, white blood cell count 4.7 with 44% neutrophils, 33% bands, hemoglobin 16.5, hematocrit 48.1, platelets 52, sodium 140, potassium 2.2, bicarbonate 15, chloride 93, BUN 12, creatinine .9.
Computerized tomography scan of abdomen as already described, cirrhosis of liver, positive varices, positive ascites, bowel thickening, increased since last examination.
Computerized tomography scan of head was negative excluding some right maxillary sinus thickening.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 45 year old male with a gram negative sepsis.

The patient's AFP measured 1.3, hepatitis B serologies were negative.
The patient's bilirubin peaked at over 30 on [**6-29**] it was 14 on [**7-8**].
Infectious disease - On admission the patient's urinalysis was with 10 white blood cells, a few bacteria, positive nitrate and culture grew out mixed Flora.
Blood cultures showed 4 out of 4 bottles of Escherichia coli.
His original source of bacteremia was unclear, chest x-ray was negative for infiltrate.
The patient's initial fluid showed 2,325 white blood cells, 4,100 red blood cells, 86% polys, 5% lymphs consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
The patient also had a fever, increased white count, the white blood cell count maximum was 26.2 on [**7-2**].
The tap on [**6-30**] was initially a diagnostic tap.
On [**7-2**] white blood cells [**Pager number **], red blood cells [**Pager number **], polys 45%.
Repeat tap was again done with albumin rehung and once again the patient had a white blood cell count of 778, 51% polys, showing improvement of the patient's condition with continued antibiotic treatment.
Heme - Initially the patient was coagulopathic with an INR of 2.5 with acute worsening thrombocytopenia, however, with treatment the patient's platelet count was 237 on [**7-9**] and his INR was 1.7 on [**7-5**].
Cardiopulmonary - The patient had an echocardiogram on [**6-25**] which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mildly depressed left ventricular function, global hypokinesis, inferior HK +1, acute mitral regurgitation with no vegetation.
The patient had troponin max of 3.3, but flat CK's.
Prophylaxis - The patient has been on subcutaneous heparin, pneumo boots, Colace, Protonix as well as Ativan for agitation and possible alcohol withdrawal which the patient at this late juncture has not had.
The patient has had a high MCV of 102, however, his B12 and Folate levels have been normal.
On [**7-9**], the patient's liver enzymes were greatly improved, ALT 52, AST 90, alkaline phosphatase 88 and total bilirubin 14.
