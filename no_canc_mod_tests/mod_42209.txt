He was transported by EMS to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital where CT head, C-spine and T-spine were performed.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED patient was lethargic, sedated, responsive only to pain, GCS 8 (2,1,5).
Repeat C/T spine CT showed no spine fracture, hemorrhage, canal stenosis; however, read of OSH spine CT revealed widening of canal at C6-7.
Follow-up MRI was ordered.
On initial exam by neurosurgery, GCS was 7 (1,1,5).
Patient was intubated, exam was performed after pt off propofol x5 min (although had received succinylcholine bolus 20 minutes prior to exam).

NONCONTRAST CT C-SPINE ([**2135-7-31**], [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital): There is no fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
There is fusion and ossification of the PLL at C5/6 .There is widening of the disc space at C6/7, recommend MRI for further evaluation.
Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.There is widening of the disc space at C6/7, recommend MRI for further evaluation.
NONCONTRAST CT C/T-SPINE ([**2135-7-31**], [**Hospital1 18**]): 1.
If this patient is high risk, this can be followed up with CT chest in 12 months.
MRI C/T/L-SPINE ([**2135-7-31**]): 1.
CT head [**2135-7-31**]: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or territorial infarction.
CXR ([**7-31**]): In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal tube now measures approximately 2.7 cm above the carina.
TTE ([**8-1**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CXR ([**8-1**]): In comparison with the study of [**7-31**], the left base is somewhat clear with the hemidiaphragm well defined.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2135-7-31**] ventricular ectopic activity is no longer noted.

Brief Hospital Course: # C6-7 CENTRAL CORD SYNDROME: MRI C/T spine revealed abnormal C6/7 disk space widening with anterior STIR hyperintensity at same level suggesting traumatic hyperextension injury.
On [**2135-8-1**], patient's neurologic exam was stable.
Cardiogenic was ruled out via normal TTE; cardiac enzymes negative x3.
On HD #2 [**2135-8-1**] patient became bradycardic to 20s with resultant hypotension, so dopamine gtt was started to maintain SBP 90-140 to optimize cord perfusion.
On [**2135-8-2**], patient's neuro exam was unchanged.
The patient was in Atrial fibrillation and blood pressures were stable.
He required a diltiazem intravenous drip for his atrial fibrillation and phnelephrine to keep his systolic blood pressure for a MAP or 65 or greater.
The patient required propofol for sedation due to blood pressure and heart rate instability when woken up.
The diltiazem continuous intravenous gtt for atrial fibrillation continued.The chest xray was consistent with the feeding tube,  which terminates within the stomach.
The patient was tachycardic to a heart rate in the 140s.
The white blood count trending down and was 12.8.
The neurological exam was unchanged.
The White Blood Count trended down 13.
The neurological exam is unchanged.
The chest xray from today which showed Interval placement of a left PICC with tip terminating in the mid-lower SVC.

?You will need cervical x-rays and or cervical CT-scan prior to your appointment.
