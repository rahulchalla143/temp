[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 10 mEq q. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, white count 5.4, hematocrit 37.8, platelets 166,000.
PT/PTT 15.8/29.3, INR 1.7.

Pulmonary function testing done on [**2112-8-5**] with moderate to restrictive impairment with decreased FVC and FEV1 and normal FEV1/FVC.
Transthoracic echocardiogram done on [**2112-10-7**] showed left atrium mildly dilated with an abnormal shadowing echodensity in the posterior portion consistent with a clot, moderate to severely reduced global left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 20-25% consistent with his history of MI, coronary artery disease, status post CABG.
Chest CT done on [**2112-10-5**] showed a small subdural hemorrhage along the right tentorium, cerebellum, without mass affect, small right frontal and parietal infarcted areas were noted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient was afebrile with a temperature of 96.7, heart rate 78, blood pressure 120/64, respiratory rate 20, saturating at 96% on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with transmitted upper airway noise.
The rectal examination was Guaiac negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with Interventional Pulmonology and was found to have severe obstruction at the proximal trachea and was admitted for further observation and management.
A review of the head CT was done.
Cardiology consult was also called for preoperative evaluation and it was felt that there was no evidence of ongoing ischemia or severe decompensation of heart failure at this time.
The initial evaluation was that the patient did not demonstrate any overt signs or symptoms of aspiration.
The patient was also started on Coumadin per his schedule and continued on IV heparin and because his INR was not therapeutic the patient was converted over to Lovenox anticoagulation therapy at 70 mg subcutaneously q.
At discharge, the patient's INR was 1.9.
12 until the INR is 2.5.
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq p.o.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his primary care physician and have his INR checked three times a week until it is stabilized to a goal INR of 2.5 and needs to continue to take his Lovenox until the INR is stabilized to 2.5.
