The patient felt worse, however, and came to the emergency department for evaluation and workup.
He was drained in [**2195-10-20**], and treated with 6 weeks of Cipro plus 2 weeks of Augmentin for an unidentified gram positive cocci through late [**Month (only) 404**].
Repeat MRI showed enlargement of the left lateral liver abscess that was impinging on the diaphragm and pericardium.
Full labs were sent off.
A KUB and chest x-ray were done that demonstrated massive cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 99.7, heart rate 89, blood pressure 133/68, respiratory rate 24, O2 saturation 96% in room air.
After a right subclavian catheter was inserted, chest x-ray confirmed placement.
Cardiology was consulted for cardiac tamponade.
A pericardiocentesis was done and he was drained for approximately 2-3 liters of fluid and culture was positive for pansensitive pseudomonas and second gram negative organism was not identified.
Cipro was also added for double coverage while the sensitivities of the pseudomonas and the ID of the gram negative rods were pending.
The patient went to the operating room for a pericardial window and resection of the liver abscess on [**3-10**].
He was converted to a sinus rhythm and started on digoxin.
He had an abdominal J-P and was draining large amounts of serosanguineous fluids as high as 1.5 liter per day.
Repeat chest x-rays demonstrated no pneumothorax.
Repeat chest x-ray demonstrated right basilar atelectasis and left effusion.
His O2 saturations were satisfactory.
His amylase and lipase increased to a high of 652 for amylase and lipase of 1403 around postoperative day 17.
His liver function tests increased during this hospital course.
A MRCP was done.
This was negative and an endoscopic ultrasound was done that showed no evidence of sludge or stones.
His liver enzymes continued to remain elevated with an AST of 268, ALT of 112, alkaline phosphatase of 788, total bilirubin of 0.7, albumin of 2.2, his amylase and lipase trended down.
All stool cultures were finalized and negative.
Abdominal CT on [**2196-3-22**], demonstrated no evidence of pancreatitis, multiple low attenuation lesions of the liver, many of which represented cysts, but could not exclude abscesses without IV contrast.
A liver ultrasound demonstrated no gallstones, no gallbladder wall thickening.
He also underwent a retroperitoneal ultrasound that demonstrated no evidence of biliary dilatation.
A portable KUB demonstrated feeding tube terminating in the distal duodenum without any bowel obstruction.
His creatinine gradually decreased to a low of 2.5.
His blood pressure remained stable.
His weight continued to remain around 84.3 kilograms.
On [**4-19**], he underwent an ultrasound of the left upper extremity that demonstrated no left upper limb deep venous thrombosis.
Heart rate was regular.
Labs: White count 7.5, hematocrit 27.9.
His hematocrit was relatively stable.
Platelet count 214,000.
Sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 97, CO2 of 25, BUN 65, creatinine 2.5, glucose 109.
The plan is to send the patient to rehabilitation for continuation of postpyloric feeding tube feedings using Peptamen full strength with banana flakes being cycled from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. with a goal rate of 100 cc per hour.
