Admission Date:  [**2177-2-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2177-2-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-9-30**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old gentleman who has a history of multiple myocardial infarctions in the past including an inferior myocardial infarction in [**2171**] and a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2176-11-19**] who is admitted from [**Hospital6 33**] with an unstable anginal syndrome, a positive troponin, and negative creatine kinases.
The patient had been having several days of worsening exertional chest pain associated with some shortness of breath, diaphoresis; his typical anginal symptoms which led him to present to the outside hospital, at which time his studies became concerning for an acute coronary syndrome.
He was started on Lopressor, Plavix, aspirin, Integrilin, and nitroglycerin and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further care.
The patient's most recent cardiac catheterization prior to this admission revealed the following:  an ejection fraction of 38%, a normal left main, a 60% tubular middle left anterior descending artery with a totally occluded first diagonal, faint left-to-left collaterals, a distal left anterior descending artery of 90%, a small ramus with a proximal 70%, circumflex system with a 90% first obtuse marginal inferior lesion, and a 70% superior pole lesion, a diffusely diseased third obtuse marginal.
Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 20 mm; and at that time the patient had stent to the first obtuse marginal with additional percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the upper pole of the first obtuse marginal.
The first diagonal which had an in-stent restenosis could not be treated at that time.
The patient was directly admitted to the catheterization laboratory at [**Hospital6 33**], at which time he underwent a limited study notable for in-stent restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery stent placed in [**2175-8-20**] and a 90% distal left anterior descending artery occlusion, and a distal left anterior descending artery that was subtotally occluded immediately proximal to a prior distal left anterior descending artery stent.
An echocardiogram done on the catheterization table revealed no evidence of tamponade.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Admission physical examination with vital signs revealing afebrile, blood pressure of 100/60, pulse of 80s on 10 mcg/kg per minute of dopamine, respiratory rate of 12, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Admission laboratories from the outside hospital revealed troponin of 0.29, creatine kinases were flat.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  CT of the abdomen, pelvis, and leg revealed a 1.5-cm X 1.5-cm hematoma with surrounding fat stranding.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for management of hypotension, for which the short differential included active blood loss which was effectively ruled out by the CT study and a vagal response necessitating inotropic support.
The patient's hematocrit was also stable, and subsequent creatine kinases remained flat.
Electrocardiogram showed no evolving changes.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up for an electrophysiology study as an outpatient on [**2177-3-6**].
