At that time he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation.
He [**Hospital1 1834**] chest CT per pulmonary recommendations, which showed diffuse emphysema, lunate configuration of the trachea, consistent with tracheomalacia, narrowing of the distal right upper lobe bronchus and some thickening of the wall, which may represent neoplasm.
Repeat MR was done on [**3-6**], which showed diffuse atheromatous disease in the infrarenal abdominal aorta, compression fracture of the left vertebral body and focal stenosis in the origin of the internal mammary artery.
In the intervening days, the patient was prepared for CT guided spinal angiogram on [**2147-3-9**].
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on transfer were as follows:  White count of 9.9, hematocrit 26.6, platelet count 376,000, PT 14.3, PTT 32.9, INR 1.4, factor 8 level 105.
Chem 7 showed the following:  sodium 139, potassium 4, chloride 109, bicarbonate 23, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, blood sugar 108, calcium 7.0, phosphate 1.7, magnesium 1.4, most recent ABG on the morning of [**2147-3-10**] showing a pH of 7.36, pCO2 42, and pO2 100.
Chest x-ray on [**2147-3-9**] showed ill-defined opacity in the right middle lobe and the right lower lobes, which were unchanged since the previous examination.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with pulmonary function tests on [**2147-3-6**] showing FEV1 of 0.59, which is 22% and FEV1/FVC of 63% predicted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on transfer:  Vital signs revealed the following:  Temperature afebrile, pulse 96, blood pressure 131/76, respiratory rate 18, saturating 100% on 50% face tent.
Repeat bronchoscopy was offered secondary to final rule out of possible neoplasm especially in the right upper lobe with wall thickening.
He finally did undergo CT myelogram on [**2147-3-15**], which showed degenerative disk disease at multiple levels of the lumbar spine and minimal myelomalacia in the thoracic area.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] swallowing study on [**2147-3-13**], which showed the following: Slightly atypical oral preparation with delayed bullous formation.
His factor 8 level was checked several times and within normal limits.
Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**]' hematocrit was noted to reach a low 26.6 with baselines between 37 to 40.
Iron studies, folate, and B12 were all checked, which were within normal limits.
