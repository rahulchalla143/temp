Admission Date:  [**2102-9-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-10-3**]   Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 82 yo M w/ h/o IMI, DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, CHF with EF of 30%, and COPD who was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**Date range (1) 14447**] for SOB and was treated for COPD flare with steroids.
Hct was 39.2 and occult blood negative.
GIB in the ED and developed worsening SOB and cardiac enzymes revealed CK 111, MB 9 trop 0.12.
EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V3.
RA 13, RV 67/17, PA 44/24, PCWP 18, CO 2.97, CI 1.6.
IABP was d/c'd and the sBP rose to the 70's.
Echo showed some AI, severity unclear.
Physical Exam: t: 96.7 HR: 65 BP: 94/47 RR: 18 AC rate of 12, breathing at 14, TV 600 FiO2 1.00, PEEP 5.
R groin with venous sheath - coagulated blood surrounding gauze.
Pulses 1+ bilaterally DP's.
Pertinent Results: CXR ([**2102-9-28**]): The heart is top-normal in size.
Coronary Cath ([**9-28**]): 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated mean PCPW of 28mmhg.
Cardiac index was low at 1.6 l/m/m2.
Central aortic pressure was  elevated at 164/81.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Shortly following insertion and intubation, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
The IABP was stopped and the pressure improved to 90s to 100s.
This raised concern for AI so an echocardiogram was performed which revealed markedly depressed ejection fraction of ~20%.
AI was noted on color doppler and seemed to increase when the baloon pump was turned on.
On leaving the catheterization lab, the patient's cardiac index had increased to 2.4 l/min/m2 and his SBP was in the 110s.
Echocardiogram ([**9-29**]) The left ventricular cavity is dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
RIGHT GROIN ULTRASOUND ([**9-30**]): Normal flow is seen in the right common femoral artery and vein.
IMPRESSION: Persistent flow in the former catheter tract over a length of 2.9 cm (5 mm in largest diameter).
ART DUP EXT R LE;F/U ([**10-2**]) Duplex evaluation was performed of the right lower extremity arterial and venous system with concentration on the inguinal region.
PUMP: EF 30% shown on echo x one week ago at OSH.
Repeat echo showed severe Left LV hypokinesis with EF of 20%.
EP was consulted but pt stated he would not want any interventions, incluing a EP study or ICD or BiV pacer.
A pressure dressing was placed and a repeat U/S showed that the pseudoaneurysm had resolved and no injection was needed.
Pt should have labs checked with PCP to ensure full resolution 4.
Sputum and stool samples came back negative, but CXR indicated a probable PNA and pt was covered empirically with Levo and Flagyl x 10 days to cover for possible aspiration as well as typical pneumonia.
He remained afebrile and WBC count trended down.
Pt had no more episodes of emesis after this and Hct remained stable, although stools were heme-occult positive.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14448**] will check a CBC to ensure plt counts remain stable.
Watch daily weights - if increases by more than 3 lbs call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and increase Lasix dose.
Please arrange to have an EGD/colonoscopy due to recent GI bleed and H.pylori infection.
