The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were all without any significant coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right-sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 15 mmHg.
Left-sided filling pressures were also moderately elevated with a PCWP of 22 mmHg.
Pulmonary artery pressures were moderately elevated with a PAS pressure of 55 mmHg.
There was borderline systemic systolic arterial hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 140/57, mean 88 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.4 L/min/m2 (using an assumed O2 consumption).
[**2121-10-1**] Chest CT: 1.
5-mm left apical nodule (4:32) should be followed-up with CT in 12 months if patient does not have a history of smoking or malignancy.
Otherwise, follow-up with CT in 6 months is recommended.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Mean transmitral gradient is 4 mm Hg.
On [**10-1**] she underwent a cardiac cath which revealed no coronary artery disease.
In addition, she underwent a chest CT. On [**10-2**] she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a redo mitral valve replacement.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
She remained slightly anemic post-op with discharge HCT of 28.6. she worked with physical therapy during her post-op course for strength and mobility.
