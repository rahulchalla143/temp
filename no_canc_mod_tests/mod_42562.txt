However, she redeveloped respiratory distress with SBP of 205, and was again treated with BiPAP and IV furosemide with good response.
Her SBP improved and averaged 140-160, but with occasoinal transient elevation to 180-190.
She may need further uptitration of these meds as an outpatient.
Urine culture showed contamination and repeat culture was negative.
4) Aortic stenosis / chronic diastolic HF: Repeat echo showed aortic valve area 1.0-1.2 cm2.
Her creatinine peaked at 1.7, likely from IV diuresis.
When switched to 20mg daily lasix, her creatinine improved to 1.1.
Retics were low, B12 and folate normal, and iron studies nonspecific, although perhaps suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
Anion gap as low as 1 was unusual in setting of minimally low albumin, normal Ca Mg Phos, although further workup was deferred based on goals of care discussion below.
Hospice of Good [**Doctor Last Name 9995**] was notified and a Russian-speaking nurse came to meet with the patient and her son.
