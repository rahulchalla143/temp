A thallium study showed a small area of ischemia in the high lateral wall.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 99.2, blood pressure was 135/80, heart rate was 104, respiratory rate was 22, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the oropharynx was clear.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremity examination revealed there was no edema.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 6.6, hematocrit was 34.3, and platelets were 218.
Sodium was 138, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 93, bicarbonate was 32, blood urea nitrogen was 21, creatinine was 5.4, and blood glucose was 253.
ALT was 23, AST was 26, alkaline phosphatase was 96, and total bilirubin was 0.3.
The urinalysis showed 3 to 5 white blood cells, 0 to 2 epithelial cells, trace leukocyte esterase, and negative nitrites.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed some fullness around the mediastinum.
Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 95.
Echocardiogram in [**2145-12-5**] revealed an ejection fraction of 55% with trace mitral regurgitation.
A stress thallium in [**2145-12-5**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 34313**] indicated a small area of ischemia in the high lateral wall.
A colonoscopy was normal in [**2146-2-5**].
A chest computed tomography indicated mediastinal fullness secondary to adipose tissue.
Postoperatively, in the Recovery Room, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures running in the 70s to 90s.
An electrocardiogram revealed no ischemic changes.
Cardiac enzymes were sent.
Additionally, continuous positive airway pressure was started given the patient's history of sleep apnea.
The patient's blood pressure stabilized in the 120s to 130s/50s to 60s.
Repeat arterial blood gases showed marked improvement.
The patient remained in the Vascular Intensive Care Unit during dialysis for closer monitoring given his cardiac enzymes which were sent.
Given the patient's delayed graft function, slight increase in troponin level were not unexpected by the Renal team.
The patient's urine output was carefully monitored as well as his electrolytes.
The patient was requiring 2 liters to 3 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula daily to maintain saturations in the 90s.
A chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions, a moderate-sized pleural effusion on the right side.
The patient's primary care physician was [**Name (NI) 653**], and we were informed that the patient regularly has an oxygen saturation in the 80s.
Given his saturation of 72% on room air with ambulation, the patient was discharged with oxygen as well as pulse oximetry with teaching provided by Respiratory Therapy.
This antibiotic was discontinued by the time of discharge, and his chest x-ray showed marked improvement.
The patient's urine output continued to improve, and he did not require any further dialysis.
