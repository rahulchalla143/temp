Conclusion angiography performed within the middle cerebral artery after TPA administration demonstrated improvement in flow to the distal MCA branches.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
