She has been followed by serial echocardiograms since [**2160**] when her primary care provider noted [**Name Initial (PRE) **] new murmur at a routine physical.
Echocardiogram done on [**2164-5-30**] showed the aortic valve was heavily calcified with limited motion consistent with a severe aortic stenosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Height 5' 1", weight 175 pounds.
Vital signs:  Heart rate 70, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 120/80, respiratory rate 18, 02 saturation 97% on room air.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Preoperatively, the white count was 4.9, hematocrit 39.3, platelets 205,000.
Sodium 143, potassium 4.6, chloride 108, C02 27, BUN 18, creatinine 0.9, glucose 114.
The echocardiogram previously referred to on [**2164-5-30**] showed a peak gradient of 82 mmHg with a mean gradient of 44 mmHg and an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm squared.
Her bypass time was 138 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 112 minutes.
On postoperative day number one, the patient was noted to have one episode of rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 150-160 that responded to IV Lopressor at which point she converted back to normal sinus rhythm.
Also, on postoperative day number two, the patient's chest tubes, Swan-Ganz catheter and Foley catheter were removed and she was transferred from the Cardiothoracic ICU to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] II for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation as well as initiation of anticoagulation for her mechanical valve.
At the time of discharge, the patient's physical examination is as follows.
Vital signs:  Temperature 98.3, heart rate 74, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 138/78, respiratory rate, 02 saturation 92% on room air.
Weight preoperative was 83 kilograms, at discharge is 88.9 kilograms.
Laboratory data revealed a white count of 8.0, hematocrit 27.8, platelets 297,000.
PT 17.9, PTT 88.3, prior to discontinuing of her heparin, and INR was 2.1.
Sodium 143, potassium 3.9, chloride 102, C02 29, BUN 13, creatinine 0.9.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her INR is to be followed by Dr.[**Name (NI) 97634**] Coumadin nurse, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 97635**], who will contact the patient on [**2164-9-19**] regarding INR checks and Coumadin dosing.
