Compared to the previous tracing of [**2165-11-11**] no change.
[**7-5**] Head CT and Head and Neck CTA: FINDINGS: HEAD CT: Mild edema is visualized in the parietal lobe which may represent edema from an ischemic event in the proper clinical setting.
Attention to this area on a non-rotated radiograph would be helpful in this regard.
[**7-10**] CXR - Line Placement: FINDINGS: A left-sided PICC is seen ending in the right atrium.
On noncontrast head CT, she was found to have likely bilateral thalamic hypodensities and possibly a pontine hypodensity, however no brainstem lesion was seen on repeat imaging.
Her exam has steadily improved, including the ability to repeat some phrases and follow a few simple commands although she remained very somnolent.
We started her on Modafinil 100mg qAM to help improve her level of awareness and subsequently added methylphenidate 5mg qAm and qNOON.
Goal INR is [**1-8**].
She was pancultured and her UA and UCx were positive.
These urine cultures are growing 2 types of GNR, pan-sensitive Proteus and enterococcus, sensitivites still pending.
Blood pressure has been well-controlled on this regimen.
GI: The patient has had somnolence and decreased cough and gag reflex that has required an NGT, and then a PEG for tube feeds and medication delivery.
Her HgbA1c is 6.7 and her fasting lipid panel showed TC 225/Trig 108/HDL 49/LDL 154.
Subsequently her visitors were screened and a password system was put in place.
5. warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)): Please adjust per INR with goal INR value [**1-8**].
6. heparin (porcine) in D5W 25,000 unit/250 mL Parenteral Solution Sig: 1000 (1000) units Intravenous continuous: Please stop once INR is therapeutic.
Please continue on this IV until your INR is therapeutic (goal INR [**1-8**]).
