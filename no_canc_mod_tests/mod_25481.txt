======== Echocardiogram [**2199-10-2**]:  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
======== Chest x-ray [**2199-10-2**]:  SINGLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the lower SVC.
Evaluate liver and gallbladder for pathology and perform Doppler to rule out clot.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver echotexture is normal without focal abnormality.
======== CT Abdomen/pelvis [**2199-10-2**]:  INDICATION: 19-year-old female 11 days postpartum with episiotomy presents with sepsis of unclear etiology, acute renal failure, liver failure, and white blood cell count of 48.
COMPARISON: Abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds performed the same day.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis without IV contrast due to the acute renal failure.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a 4 cm pocket of gas within or adjacent to the left iliacus muscle and smaller locules of gas tracking into the sacroiliac joint, left S1 neural foramen and left piriformis and gluteus minimus muscles.
======== Pathology [**2199-10-4**]:  Pathology Examination  Name Birthdate    Age     Sex Pathology #     [**Hospital1 18**] [**Known lastname 84662**],[**Known firstname **]       [**2179-12-14**]    19 Female      [**-9/3912**] [**Numeric Identifier 84663**] Report to:   DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Necrotic bone (A-B): Consistent with acute osteomyelitis (see note).
======== Chest x-ray [**2199-10-9**]:  REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient with septic shock.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2199-10-8**].
======== CT torso [**2199-10-9**]:  HISTORY: Septic shock.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis performed [**2199-10-2**], aortic angiogram [**2199-10-3**] and right upper quadrant ultrasound [**2199-10-9**].
CT CHEST  64-row MDCT was performed from the thoracic inlet to the base of the lung.
There is high-density material in the dependent portion of the gallbladder consistent with vicarious excretion likely from the prior angiogram of [**2199-10-3**].
There is punctate calcification within the left adrenal gland which was stable from the prior CT scan.
This was not present on the prior study or at least was not evident.
CT PELVIS  64-row MDCT was performed from the iliac crest to the symphysis pubis.
Vicarious excretion of contrast in the gallbladder.
Compared to the prior study, the attenuation of the liver has increased and now measures approximately 48 Hounsfield units, previously measuring 43 to 44 Hounsfield units.
CT Pelvis ([**10-21**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
======== Chest x-ray [**2199-10-14**]:  IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-13**], 5:22 a.m.:  No endotracheal tube is seen below C6, the upper margin of this film.
Lung volumes are lower and there is greater opacification generally particularly in the right lung.

sensitivity testing performed by Microscan.
Initial imaging of the pelvis was highly concerning for septic arthritis of the left sacroiliac joint and associated osteomyelitis.
Peri-intubation the patient was transiently without a pulse and 3 chest compressions were performed with return of spontaneous circulation.
Cultures from the wound grew fusobacterium necrophorum.
Renal function improved from a creatinine of 3.1 on admission to 1.0.
After transfer, her oxygen was quickly weaned off from 5 L to room air within 2 days.
I informed the surgical ICU team to monitor hematocrit in the following hours in the case of persistent bleeding from the surgical site.
======== Superior gluteal artery embolization [**2199-10-3**]:  INDICATION: 19-year-old woman status post left iliac debridement for osteomyelitis with subsequent bleeding from the left superior gluteal artery with active bleeding seen during surgery and hematocrit drop from 26 to 13.
The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the table.
A preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 18**] protocol.
A C2 cobra catheter was advanced over the wire and an arteriogram of the left internal iliac artery demonstrated active contrast extravasation from the left superior gluteal artery.
Based on the diagnostic findings, the decision was made to perform embolization.
A total of 100 cc of Visipaque was used during the arteriogram.
Some additonal curetagge of the cavity was performed and cultures were sent again.
[**Known lastname **]'S STATEMENT:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] was present for the entire procedure and then referred the case to the GYN service to perform a D and C.  ======== D&C and removal of suture material from perineum [**2199-10-4**]:  OPERATIVE REPORT  [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 84665**] **NOT REVIEWED BY ATTENDING**  Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]          Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 84663**]  Service:                          Date:  Date of Birth:  [**2179-12-14**]        Sex:  F  [**Year (4 digits) **]:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 50701**], [**MD Number(1) 84666**]  SERVICE:  OB/GYN.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1.
A pelvic ultrasound revealed a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis, some debris without vascularity in the uterus and no evidence of vascularity.
There was no clinical evidence on exam of retained products of conception.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was done which revealed gas within the left iliac and piriformis and phlegmon which was seen in the left sacral iliac joint.
The exam under anesthesia revealed an approximately 1-cm dilated cervix, however, her swelling from her fluids did not allow for the fundus to be felt on bimanual exam.
A time-out was taken per operating room protocol.
She had pneumatic compression boots which were on and working.
A sample was sent for aerobic and anaerobic culture as well as sent to pathology for examination.
The ring forceps was then removed and the blood cleared from the vagina.
The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct per operating room staff.
