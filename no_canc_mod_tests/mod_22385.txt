On his preoperative studies, a chest CT noted the presence of pneumomediastinum and air around the cervical esophagus.
A Gastrograffin swallow confirmed the location of the tear to be in the cervical esophagus.

BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM  INDICATION: 25-year-old man with esophageal rupture and repair.
No structural abnormalities are detected in the region of the pharynx, cervical esophagus, or mid and distal esophagus.
A scout film of the upper thorax and neck reveals free air within the mediastinum.
Thereafter, a water-soluble esophageal study was performed which demonstrates a leak in the upper esophagus on the right side at the level of the manubrium.
Upon presentation, his diagnosis was made via an esophagram which showed his esophageal rupture was at the level of manubrium with leaked contents traveling both superiorly and inferiorly along the right side of the esophagus.
A follow-up esophagram was done on POD 9 but showed a continued leak.
This exam was then repeated on POD 20 with resolution of the leak.
From an infectious disease standpoint, a sputum culture on [**9-11**] returned positive for Klebsiella and he was additionally placed on Unasyn.
Furthermore, a JP fluid culture from [**9-22**] was also positive for Klebsiella and he was then switched from Unasyn to Levofloxacin on [**2101-9-24**] for more narrowed, specific antibiotic coverage.
