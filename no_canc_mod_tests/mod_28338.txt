Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within normal limits.
ECHO ([**2102-5-22**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall EF 40-45% Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is top normal.
Clinical history, EKG findings and normal biomarkers made ACS unlikely as the etiology.
Was admitted to the CCU and a temporary wire was placed via the right IJ.
The morning after admission, an echo was obtained that showed an EF of 40-45%.
Cardiac enzymes were checked and he ruled out for new MI.
A lipid panel was checked and showed a low LDL and HDL in addition to high triglycerides.
Pump: Echo obtained showed an EF of 40-45% and focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral wall.
Non-gap acidosis: Felt to be secondary to diarrhea (a chronic issue); resolved on HD #2.
Beta-blocker was held (as above) and restarted before discharge.
You are scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1911**] for evaluation of your pacemaker.
