[**2180-10-19**] EKG 7PM: Ventricular paced rhythm with wide QRS complexes.
As compared with prior tracing of [**2180-10-19**] right bundle-branch block is now evident.
[**2180-10-20**] ECHO The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the interventricular septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
[**2180-10-25**] CT Abd/Pelv IMPRESSION: 1.
An echo confirmed systolic CHF with an EF of 20-30% as well as severe (4+) TR.
His ACE was held at discharge pending creatinine stabilization and blood pressure tolerance.
In the ED here, the ICD reportedly fired again, but EP interrogation of the pacer revealed no VT/VF or discharges.

While you were here we also did a CT scan of your abdomen since we felt a mass there.
You have a heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, which puts you at an increased risk for having a stroke.
