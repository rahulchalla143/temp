Labs showed subtherapeutic digoxin level and subtherapeutic INR at 1.3.
At noon, repeat head CT showed right occipito-parietal conversion, 5x5 cm bleed, w/intraventricular extension, 8 mm midline shift.
Exam before transfer was GCS 13, awake, lethargic, following commands.
EMS neuro exam described as not opening eyes but following commands, oriented to self only.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: Vitals: T 99.4, RR 18 (not monitoring other vitals, pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] Neuro exam: does not open eyes to sternal rub.
Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission:  [**2112-8-16**] 07:26PM   WBC-16.5* RBC-3.73* HGB-11.7* HCT-34.4* MCV-92 MCH-31.3 MCHC-34.0 RDW-13.2 [**2112-8-16**] 07:26PM   NEUTS-91.2* LYMPHS-3.0* MONOS-4.6 EOS-1.1 BASOS-0.1 [**2112-8-16**] 07:26PM   PT-20.1* PTT-37.0* INR(PT)-1.9* [**2112-8-16**] 07:26PM   FIBRINOGE-334 [**2112-8-16**] 07:26PM   CK-MB-3 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2112-8-16**] 07:26PM   GLUCOSE-188* UREA N-20 CREAT-1.2 SODIUM-134 POTASSIUM-4.7 CHLORIDE-100 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-15  Imaging:  Head CT w/o contrast [**2112-8-17**] Extensive hemorrhagic conversion of relatively acute right MCA territorial infarct, with surrounding edema, sulcal and ventricular effacement, and stable degree of subfalcine herniation.
Head CT w/o contrast [**2112-8-22**] Stable  EEG [**8-22**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Head CT w/o contrast [**2112-8-24**]: Stable appearance of right MCA territory infarct with hemorrhagic conversion with slightly increased mass effect with effacement of the right lateral ventricle and increased size of the left lateral ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is an 86 yo RHM with history of paroxysmal AFib on warfarin, sinus node dysfunction s/p pacemaker, well-controlled DM 2, dyslipidemia, HTN, laryngeal CA, who was transferred from OSH ICU after developing a hemorrhagic conversion of an ischemic infarct, with large fronto-temporal-parietal hemorrhage on head CT causing significant midline shift.
#NEURO: On admission, INR was 1.9 and was reversed with 10mg vitamin K, 2 units of FFP, 6 units of platelets and profilin 9.
On exam [**8-16**], no eye opening to sternal rub, not following commands, PERRL (1.5-->1), + corneals, mild L facial droop, + cough, mild w/d of LUE to noxious stimuli; triple flexion to noxious stimuli in LLE.
Neuro exam was largely unchanged.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 916**],  You were admitted to the hospital with a large stroke which bled into your brain.
