She initially presented to an OSH ([**Hospital3 **]) on [**7-20**] due to elevated INR of 12 on labs drawn at home, and upon arrival was found to have abdominal pain, RR 22, and O2 sat of 95% on RA in the setting of an INR of 9.8, WBC 13.1, and T Bili 2.2.
Abd CT revealed cholelithiasis with external biliary duct dilatation (unchanged from CT on [**2142-7-3**]).
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98, P 104, BP 98/60, R 18, O2 sat 96% 4L NC.
Her WBC were 21.5, and her LFTs were significant for elevated T Bili and Alk Phos.
She was evaluated with US (which showed acute cholecystitis) and abdomen CT to rule out gangrenous cholecysttis.

[**2142-7-31**] CT Abdomen wet read: Moderate b/l pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.
GB wall not well evaluated on the current study but no evidence of gas within the gallbadder wall or lumen.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Large gallstone and RUQ pain: likely chronic cholecystitis.
Her exam was concerning for acute cholecystitis, and her leukocytosis and OSH HIDA scan was suggestive of this as well.
Upon imaging here, her gallbadder lumen appeared to be entirely occupied with the stone, which could also explain the positive HIDA scan at OSH.
Her WBC started to trend down and was 26 at the time of d/c.
Diastolic CHF: with AS, severe TR, LA/RA dilatation.
Her urine output did not seem to respond and she remained extremely edematous.
Her Coumadin was held during her stay because of supratherapeutic INR, and at the time of discharge her INR was 2.0, so the Coumadin was still held.
Her CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, so she likely had an element of volume overload.
Decreased urine output: FENa was <1%; her decreased output is likely due to decreased intravascular volume as described above, from cardiac cause.
DM2, diet-controlled: she was placed on diabetic diet and FS were checked qACHS - they ranged from 90-140 and she required no insulin coverage.
INR trended down while off Coumadin and at the time of discharge was 2.0 - her Coumadin was held at discharge.
Her CT abdomen showed ascites; she likely has an element of liver disease contributing to her coagulopathy.
