His post-operative course was complicated by fever and leukocytosis on [**2-23**]; a urine culture grew E. coli, and an infected PIV site grew MSSA; he was started on Cipro and Vanco on [**2-23**] and then was transitioned to Levofloxicin for 7 day course on [**2-28**].
On [**4-13**] his symptoms worsened further, with [**10-13**] pain and inability to move his right side.
He was referred to the emergency room early in the morning on [**4-14**] where an MRI revealed an epidural abscess from C2-C4, with spinal cord compression.

VITALS: Tm 99.7F, Tc 99.7F, BP 140/90 (140-185/72-118), HR 104, Sat 94-97% GENERAL: C-collar in place, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, OP clear without lesions NECK: Unable to examine because of neck brace CARD: RRR, normal S1/S2, no m/r/g RESP: Course rhonchi bilaterally ABD: Soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly BACK: No spinal tenderness below cervical region EXT: No clubbing/cyanosis/edema, 2+ DP pulses NEURO: CN II-XII (grossly; difficult to perform full exam given limited patient cooperation), A&O x 0, Strength 3-/5 in right upper and right lower extremity, full on left.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-2-14**] poor R wave progression is not seen on the current tracing.
If there is further clinical concern for acute stroke, an MR is more sensitive.
The fluid collection could represent an epidural abscess or hematoma.
Contrast gadolinium-enhanced MRI can help for further assessment.
Again, contrast-enhanced MRI can help for further assessment.
However, review of prior studies suggests that there has been prior instrumentation and intervertebral fusion devices at these levels and this may represent residua from that.
[**2192-4-15**] C-spine MRI: Progression of abnormality since the cervical spine MR of [**2192-4-14**].
[**2192-4-16**] CXR: Small left pleural effusion and pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion suggest volume overload and/or cardiac decompensation, increased since [**4-15**].
[**2192-4-16**] Left upper extremity ultrasound: No left upper extremity DVT.
[**2192-4-18**] CT Head: 1.
[**2192-4-18**] CT C-spine: 1.
[**2192-4-18**] CT L-spine: 1.
Please note, if further evaluation of the spine and epidural spaces is desired, dedicated MRI could be obtained.
[**2192-4-24**] CXR: As compared to the previous examination, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.
[**2192-4-24**] CT Abd/Pelvis without contrast: No interposed loops of large bowel between the stomach and the anterior abdominal wall.
Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is normal.
However, the intensity of enhancement, the size of epidural fluid collections, the spinal cord edema, and prevertebral fluid and enhancement have all improved dramatically since the examination of [**2192-4-17**].
His post-operative course was complicated by fever and leukocytosis on [**2-23**]; a urine culture grew E. coli, and an infected PIV site grew MSSA; he was started on Cipro and Vanco on [**2-23**] and then was transitioned to Levofloxicin for 7 day course on [**2-28**].
On [**4-13**] his symptoms worsened further, with [**10-13**] pain and inability to move his right side.
He was referred to the emergency room early in the morning on [**4-14**] where an MRI revealed an epidural abscess from C2-C4, with spinal cord compression.
Post-operatively he developed right sided hemiparesis and went back for repeat operation on [**4-15**] after repeat imaging showed increase in size of the epidural abscess.
Blood and wound cultures from admission and the OR grew MSSA.
A repeat MRI was performed [**4-17**] with continued expansion of the epidural abscess and leptomeningeal enhancement.
An LP was performed on [**4-17**] concerning for meningitis with high protein (590), low glucose (34), 33 WBC, but negative gram stain and culture.
MRI head showed no structural abnormalities or evidence of septic infarct.
Pain was treated with standing acetaminophen (500-1000mg Q6H), and tramadol was added when his medication improved.
CT C-spine showed extensive inflammatory changes, but improved appearance overall.
All surveillance cultures have been negative to date.
Stable, with benign abdominal exam; abdominal x-ray showed no dilatation.
Continue metoprolol, lisinopril, HCTZ (started this admission) at maximum doses; increased diltiazem to 90mg QID (although doubt much help with blood pressure).
Blood pressures improved on current regimen.
