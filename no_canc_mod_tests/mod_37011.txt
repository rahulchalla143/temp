IMAGING: [**2163-9-25**] CT Torso: IMPRESSION: 1.
Nevertheless, followup to exclude pulmonary nodules is recommended with a dedicated CT scan of the chest in approximately 6-12 months.
[**2163-9-27**] TRANSTHORACIC ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-4-22**], findings are similar.
T8-9 and T9-10 left paracentral and foraminal protrusions, respectively, without spinal cord or exiting neural impingement.
Antibiotics were changed to nafcillin 2 g IV Q4 hours once blood cultures returned MSSA.
Blood cultures were sent, as there was concern for a transient bacteremia.
TTE from [**2163-9-27**] and TEE from [**2163-9-29**] showed no evidence of endocarditis.
She intermittently complained of back and neck pain similar to her previous arthritis pain, but an MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine showed no evidence of thoracolumbar vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, or paraspinal or epidural fluid collection or abscess.
Hematocrit trended down but ultimately stabilized.
