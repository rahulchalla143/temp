In the ED, the patient had the following vital signs: 98.6 120 92/60 18 97% NRB.
In the MICU, she arrived in acute respiratory distress and tachypneic with heart rate in the 130s in a fib with RVR, and hypoxic to the 80s on 6LNC.
She was also given 5mg and 10mg IV dilt for HR in 140s, followed by dilt 60mg PO QID with improvement in her rate down to 110s.
Pertinent Results: [**2103-5-4**] 10:47AM BLOOD WBC-26.0* RBC-2.91* Hgb-7.6* Hct-25.2* MCV-87 MCH-26.3* MCHC-30.3* RDW-19.5* Plt Ct-86* [**2103-5-4**] 10:47AM BLOOD ALT-4019* AST-5755* LD(LDH)-PND AlkPhos-57 TotBili-4.5* [**2103-5-4**] 10:58AM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-81* pCO2-45 pH-7.11* calTCO2-15* Base XS--15 [**2103-5-4**] 10:58AM BLOOD Lactate-14.6* CXR [**4-11**]: COMPARISON: [**2103-2-22**].
CXR [**4-12**]: Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
Pneumonic consolidations, right greater than left are unchanged.
CXR [**4-30**]: A tracheostomy tube and left-sided PICC are in unchanged positions.
The lungs are stable in appearance with background emphysema, bilateral pleural effusions and extensive consolidations which are greater on the right.
EKG [**4-23**]: Diffuse artifact.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2103-4-11**] the ventricular response is more controlled.
ECHO [**4-23**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Her lactate rose and her cdiff toxin returned positive.
WBC rose.
Dyspnea/hypoxia: Patient with a white count of 29 with bandemia, and dense RLL consolidation, which raises the concern for acute bacterial pneumonia.
Due to lack of clear improvement and concern for increasing sputum, she had a bronch (awake) which showed minimal secreations but significant airway collapse.
BAL fluid sent for culture and grew sparse coag + staph and spare yeast.
Of note, the patient's CT chests document very little apical parenchymal reserve and significant blebs.
WBC was noted to rise to 23.8 and abx were restarted to cover VAP with Linezolid/tobra and zosyn.
Her prednisone was down titrate.
NGT was placed instead, which the patient tolerated well and maintained during intubation.
Interventional pulmonology attempted to place a PEG on [**2103-4-26**] but was unsuccessful due to esophageal stenosis.
- Continue tube feeds: Nutren 2.0 Full strength; Starting rate: 30 ml/hr; Advance rate by 10 ml q12h Goal rate: 30 ml/hr Residual Check: q4h Hold feeding for residual >= : 200 ml Flush w/ 30 ml water q6h - Continue multivitamin, Vitamin B12 50mcg daily and Vitamin D 400mg daily - Continue lansoprazole, simethicone and zofran for GI upset, nausea .
Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive overnight on [**4-30**] likely related to escalating doses of metoprolol amd small doses of narcotics and ultram which she seems sensitive to.
Cortisol levels could not be checked in setting of recent prednisone.
Her blood pressures were monitored through her arterial line.
BPs ranged from hypotensive (thought [**1-3**] meds) to hypertensive (possibly pain related) and normalized on their own.
Rate well controlled on PO diltiazem and home digoxin - this was later decreased to 30mg QID and her metoprolol decreased from 12.5 mg TID to [**Hospital1 **] given bradycardia into HR50s (asymptomatic), especially when intubated.
Metoprolol was uptitrated again briefly for BP and HR control, but subsequently was downtitrated due to bradycardia.
- Continue Digoxin 0.125mg daily - Continue Metoprolol 12.5mg twice daily - Check INR daily as supratherapeutic on discharge.
Resume home coumadin 5mg daily when INR <2.5 .
ECHO was obtained with showed 3+TR and severe pulmonary hypertension.
Glargine was stopped on [**4-29**] for hypoglycemia and her sliding scale was made more conservative to only cover glucose >200.
Her spiriva was ultimately restarted and atrovent was discontinued.
She developed fulminant c.difficuile with a dramatically elevated WBC (18), INR (6.1) and lactate (14) with an increasing pressor requirement and concern for abdominal compartment syndrome.
Echo findings demonstrated dramatic pulmonary hypertension and left-sided heart failure.
Her liver enzymes increased and she developed shock liver.
