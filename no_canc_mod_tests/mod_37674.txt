Given the occlusion right ICA occlusion and possible thrombus on left ICA, you were started on heparin drip with goal PTT 40~60 and Coumadin was started on [**3-19**] after ensuring that the hematoma was not increasing in size and hematocrit was stable.
You need heparin drip with goal PTT 40~60 until INR is therapeutic (2~3) with Coumadin.
