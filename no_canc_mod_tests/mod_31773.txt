[**2127-2-17**] - Bleeding Scan - No evidence of bleeding during the time of the study.
EGD [**9-14**] - Gastric Ulcer.
TTE [**2-/2124**] - Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF> 55%).
INR was reversed with vit K and FFPs.
The patient stayed hemodynamically stable although required a total of 11 units of PRBCs to keep hct around 30.
Initial bleeding scan was negative.
Due to continued BRBPR however, a tagged RBC scan was repeated and showed faint/slow bleeding at splenic flexure.
The patient's bowel prep was continued and underwent colonoscopy on [**2-19**] which showed multiple diverticulosis in the left colon without bleeding.
Once on the floor she remained stable, with no further bleeds, and her hematocrit was been stable.
# Access - 2 large bore PIVs were maintained .
Secondary: atrial fibrillation, gout, depression, peptic ulcer disesase   Discharge Condition: Stable hematocrit, good oxygen saturation on room air, no fluid overload.
