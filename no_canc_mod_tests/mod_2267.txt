HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old gentleman with a history of severe dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in [**2142**] by catheterization, at which time he was found to have normal coronaries and elevated PA pressures of 80/45 with a cardiac output of 2.9 and 4+ mitral regurgitation.
Patient was found to be H. pylori positive, treated with antibiotics and on [**4-23**] had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed chronic inactive gastritis.
Patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization and for inotropic therapy.
At a catheterization on the day of admission the PA pressures were 66/26.
Cardiac index was 1.4.
His pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24.
Patient was started on milrinone of .5 and his PA pressures were 64/22 and a cardiac index of 1.9 in the catheterization laboratory.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Congestive heart failure:  severe dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in [**2142**], echocardiogram in [**2148-4-15**] showed ejection fraction of 15 to 20 percent, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, 1% atrial regurgitation, 4+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, catheterization in [**2142**] showed normal coronaries with a cardiac output of 2.9 and an index of 1.4.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include Lasix 60 q.d., Aldactone 25 q.d., Coreg 25 b.i.d., Captopril 60 t.i.d., digoxin .125 q.o.d., Lipitor 10 q.d., Coumadin 4 q.d., Protonix 40 b.i.d., Carafate 1 gram q.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission vital signs - temperature 96.7, heart rate 55 to 58, blood pressure 82/65, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 98 on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination: extraocular movements intact, oropharynx dry.
Lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Neurologic examination was grossly intact.
LABORATORY STUDIES:  On admission white count 5.4, hematocrit 33.8, platelets 218, sodium 136, potassium 4.6, chloride 100, bicarb 25, BUN 36 and creatinine 2.1, baseline 1.3 to 2.1.
PTT 16.6 and INR of 1.9.
ALT 25, AST 27, alk phos 48, total bilirubin 1.0.
Arterial blood gases in the catheterization laboratory of 7.43, 32 and 68.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 62 year-old gentleman with class 4 congestive heart failure and a severe dilating cardiomyopathy admitted for hemodynamic monitoring and Noridone therapy.
Cardiovascular - coronaries:  the patient had normal cardiac catheterization and flat CK's.
The patient's cardiac output improved to 3.9.
Amiodarone 200, Lasix 20, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d., Coreg 12.5 t.i.d., Aldactone 12.5 q.d., Digoxin .0125 q.d.
His symptoms and his weight were monitored closely.
He decided that he was not willing to receive blood transfusion, due to his religious beliefs, which has very high likelihood of being required as life saving therapy during both procedures.
Renal:  Patient's creatinine improved during his hospital stay such that his creatinine returned to his baseline prior to discharge.
Patient should also monitor his daily weights and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding weight gain or loss.
