She denies any fever, chills, cough, sputum production, or hemoptysis.
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were T97.7, BP 111/56, HR 92, RR 28.
She was found to have an oxygen saturation of 45% in with solumedrol 125 mg IV X 1 as well as stacked albuterol/atrovent nebs.
CXR demonstrated small bilateraly effusions and ?
She was then treated with lasix 60 mg IV X 1 after CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema.
She was noted to drop her oxygen saturations to 86% on 4 L NC when nebs were completed.
At the time of transfer, her oxygen saturations were 89-91% on 3 L NC (home oxygen).

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2162-11-24**] no change.
[**2164-12-9**] CXR - IMPRESSION: 1.
Retrocardiac opacity, which could represent a combination of atelectasis and hiatal hernia.
A repeat study after appropriate treatment is recommended.
[**2164-12-10**] CXR - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2164-12-10**] Echo - Impression: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-5-9**], the right ventricular cavity is now dilated with more prominent free wall hypokinesis.
Right ventricular pressure overload is now suggested, though the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is similar.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 80571**] is a 68 year old woman with a past medical history notable for severe kyphoscoliosis, diastolic CHF, and reactive and restrictive lung disease who presented with shortness of breath and a CHF exacerbation.
EKG showed no evidence of new ischemia and cardiac enzymes x 2 were negative.
She had an elevated BNP of 7885, CXR with bilateral pleural effusions, and ECHO with worsened RVH.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine was elevated to 1.7 on admission and initially felt to be related to poor forward flow in setting of initiation of diltiazem and/or CHF exacerbation.
Her creatinine improved with diuresis.
Lisinopril and naproxen were held while her creatinine remained elevated.
# Hypertension: The patient remained normotensive with SBP 100s-130s despite holding of both her lisinopril (due acute renal insufficiency) and her diltiazem (due to CHF exacerbation).
Calcium  Oral 14.
Pulmonary hypertension 3.
SBP 100s-130s.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of shortness of breath and increased oxygen requirement.
Please call your physician or return to the hospital if you develop worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, fevers, or any other concerning symptoms.
