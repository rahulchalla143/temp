CT CHEST [**7-26**]: 1.
ECHO with bubble study [**8-2**]: The left atrium is elongated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers; however cannot definitively exclude particularly since images were suboptimal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-7-26**], findings are similar.
Lung Biopsy Path: 1.
Pleural fluid: 2+ PMNs, no growth on culture (final) .

CCP IgG negative  Brief Hospital Course: 66M with longstanding PMH of COPD, R pleural effusion presents with hypoxia and R sided pleural effusion.
# Pleural Effusion/Pneumothorax A CT chest showed evidence of increase in size of the known R sided pneumothorax, and Interventional Pulmonology was consulted.
# CORONARIES: DOE was the pt's only symptom, and his EKG unchanged.
A TTE on [**7-26**] showed preserved EF and overall normal systolic function, and a repeat Echo with bubble study on [**8-2**] also showed preserved EF and no ASD/PFO.
He presented with no pedal edema, and coarse crackles on lung exam in presence of slightly larger effusion.
A TTE on [**7-26**] showed preserved EF and overall normal systolic function, and a repeat Echo with bubble study on [**8-2**] also showed preserved EF and no ASD/PFO.
In the MICU, the pt was given lasix and the pt was diuresed 1700mL after which his R pleural effusion on CXR appeared slightly improved.
A PA lateral was performed which showed R sided effusion.
He had a colonoscopy which was negative [**Month (only) 958**] of this year.
Serial chest films showed improving right lower lobe effusion.
