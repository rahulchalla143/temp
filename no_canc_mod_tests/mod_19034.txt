The [**Hospital 228**] [**Hospital3 **] course is also notable for a 2 unit packed red blood cell transfusion for a hematocrit of 24 in the setting of guaiac positive stools and an INR of greater then 8.0.  REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  Fatigue, malaise, chest pain centered around the pacemaker insertion as well as dyspnea on exertion, stable three pillow orthopnea and stable lower extremity edema.
Acute pancreatitis [**3-/2121**], endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a common bile duct dilatation/stricture.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.9, blood pressure 105/48, heart rate 90, respiratory rate 27 with an O2 sat of 98 percent on 4 liters.
The patient has an irregular rhythm with a grade 2 out of 6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex radiating to the axilla.
She has 1 plus dorsalis pedis pulses and trace posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
Neurological examination mental status the patient is alert, oriented times three.
Cranial nerve examination is notable for moderate hearing loss, otherwise unremarkable.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 130, potassium 8.7, chloride 95, bicarb 21, BUN 58 creatinine 2.1, glucose 248, white blood cell count 5 with a hematocrit of 28 and platelets of 86.
Electrocardiogram demonstrates a paced rhythm with atrial premature complexes, left atrial abnormality, left bundle branch block with an intraventricular conduction delay.
Subsequent ECG    on the [**5-11**] showed what was likely to be a wide    complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block,    superior axis with AV dissociation consistent with    ventricular tachycardia.
Chest film demonstrated that the A lead is    well placed and the V lead had become dislodged.
Subsequent fluoroscopy revealed that the V lead was    dislodged and located in the RVOT (had been placed in the    RVA).
An incision was made over the    generator and a moderate amount of brown fluid was    expressed from the pocket.
Fluid was sent for studies and    revealed involvement with MRSA.
Out of concern for possible endocarditis given the combination of high grade MRSA bacteremia, likely infected pacer wire, which is present in the RV and RVOT as well as newly appreciated MR murmur, the patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram, which did reveal mild to moderate mitral regurgitation as well as moderate mitral annular calcification.
The MRI revealed the graft is patent with patent proxima and distal anastomosis though with a large amount of fluid along entire extent of the graft that is up to 3 cm in transverse diameter in portions.
The patient is to undergo ultrasound guided diagnostic tap of this perigraft fluid on the [**5-18**].
The patient's surveillance cultures had been negative since the [**5-12**] through the time of this dictation summary.
Although initially the MRI was concerning for L5 S1 facet joint septic arthritis and possible associated epidural abscess a subsequent review of the MRI with both neurosurgery and infectious disease consult as well as with radiology revealed a very low level of suspicion for either septic arthritis or epidural abscess.
Serial physical examinations were followed and there was no evidence of cord compression through the time of this dictation summary.
Additional stool studies are pending at the time of this dictation summary.
However, further studies revealed    dislodgement of the ventricular pacemaker lead and    displacement into the RVOT.
The patient's potassium and magnesium    were aggressively repleated with a goal potassium greater    then 4.5 and a goal magnesium greater then 2.5.
Although her    CK maximum is 111 on the [**5-10**] troponin T was .32    and subsequently 0.35 on the [**5-11**].
Congestive heart failure:  The patient was noted to have    significant pulmonary edema on physical examination on    admission.
An MR of the head did not demonstrate any    evidence for septic emboli, although there was concern for    a small (.5 cm) subdural hematoma in the right occipital    region.
However, subsequent CT did not demonstrate any    intra or extracranial hemorrhage.
An ophthalmology    consultation was obtained and a dilated examination was    performed.
The patient's visual examination was noted to be    stable on subsequent serial examinations.
The patient's    white blood cell, hematocrit and platelet count all    increased over the period of this dictation.
Acute renal failure:  The patient was noted to have ARF on    admission with a creatinine of 2.1 on admission.
