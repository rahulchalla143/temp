emergency department.
He had a CT torso which did not show pneumonia and he had a non-contrast CT head which was negative.
LP was not performed because of elevated INR.
In the ICU, patient received 6 units of FFP for reversal of INR before LP could be safely obtained by IR on hospital day 3.
LP notable for protein of 178, WBC 3, RBC 12, glucose 116.
MRI of the head showed no evidence of any infection.
Anti-hypertensives were restarted on hospital day 4 after SBP > 200, and patient was successfully extubated on hospital day 5.
Vital signs at the time of transfer to the floor were: T97.8, HR 89 (in fib/flutter), BP 139/60 by NIBP (168/61 by A-line), RR 22 O2 93% 2L NC.
LOS fluid balance of +3.2L, net out 550cc for the day, with 2.9L of UOP over the day.
With regard to his hypertension, patient's blood pressure continued to remain elevated despite treatment with amlodipine 5mg, lisinopril 40mg, and metoprolol 75mg TID.
It is likely that the patient's blood pressure was not optimally controlled as an outpatient.
His blood pressures were reasonable on this regimen.
On [**4-20**], his HSV PCR came back as negative and his acyclovir was discontinued.
Blood sugars were reasonable on this regimen.
Cardiac enzymes were elevated on presentation but trended downward with clinical picture more consistant with demand ischemia rather than true ACS.
A lipid panel was checked to determine need for statin therapy.
Patient LDL was found to be 151 and triglycerides were 191.
As his INR was reversed with FFP in the unit, pt was tritrated back to therapeutic INR with lovenox bridge.
You blood pressures were also elevated during your hospital admission so we started you on a new blood pressure medication - amlodipine 10mg by mouth once per day.
