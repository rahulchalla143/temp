On [**6-24**] he underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel coronary artery disease with patent bypasses, severe aortic stenosis, moderate left diastolic ventricular dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
An echo was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, critical aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.8cm, moderate aortic insufficiency, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
-A chest CT revealed distal ascending, arch, and descending aortic calcifications.
-Pulmonary function tests showed an FEV1 on 69% predicted pre-drug and 77% post-drug.
Dsb was 21, VAsb 5, DsbHb 21, and D/VAsbHb was 3.6.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-7-24**], the echodensity on the posterior leaflet may have been present on the prior study also.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
He developed thrombocytopenia and a HIT panel later returned negative.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed no bowel ischemia.
The abdominal exploration revealed no abnormal abdominal processes.
His platelets continued to drift downward and a seratonin assay was sent.
He was on TPN for a period of time and then transitioned backl to tube feeds successfully.Subsequently, a repeat echo revealed a MV vegetation.
