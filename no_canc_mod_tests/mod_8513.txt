The patient's symptoms persisted until she presented to [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital on 529/01 and was found to have finger stick blood sugars in the 300s with an anion gap of 19 and 15 ketones in her urine and small acetone in her blood.
Routine check of her CK and troponin noted elevation in troponin.
Coronary artery disease status post left circumflex stent in [**2099**], cardiac catheterization on [**2106-5-28**] revealed left anterior descending coronary artery with diffuse disease, left circumflex with diffuse disease, right coronary artery with 99% occlusion with left to right collaterals, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16, left ventricular and diastolic pressure 20.
Cardiac output 2.7, ejection fraction 33% with 1+ mitral regurgitation and anterolateral apical inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis.
Chronic renal insufficiency with recent baseline creatinine of 2.7 to 2.9.
Pulse 101.
Blood pressure 153/74.
Respiratory rate 20.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurological examination was nonfocal.
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES:  On [**2106-7-1**] at the outside hospital white blood cell count 17.5, hematocrit 40, platelets 306, sodium 135, potassium 5.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate 11, BUN 34, creatinine 3.0, glucose 370.
CK 463, troponin 73, liver function tests notable for AST 48, ALT 14, alkaline phosphatase 122, amylase 80, lipase 24.
Urinalysis revealed 15 ketones, greater then 1000 glucose, 6 to 10 white blood cells, 11 to 20 red blood cells.
Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital showed sinus tachycardic at 115 beats per minute, normal axis and normal intervals, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in leads 3F, V2 through V3 with a Q wave in lead 3 and AVF.
This was not significantly changed from electrocardiogram on [**2106-5-23**].
Patient with known ejection fraction of 35 to 40% with diastolic dysfunction.
On the day prior to discharge the patient received 40 mg of intravenous Lasix in the setting of her blood transfusions and diuresed approximately 1500 cc and was approximately 1600 cc negative for the day.
Her hematocrit remained stable during that time and it was discontinued on [**2106-7-3**].
As noted a cardiac catheterization was not repeated during this hospitalization given recently defined anatomy.
Renal:  Patient with a chronic renal insufficiency with a prior baseline creatinine of approximately 1.3.
The patient's creatinine remained relatively stable at about 3 during this hospitalization.
On [**2106-7-2**] the patient's anion gap had closed and she was starting to take po with finger stick blood sugars in the 100s to 200s.
Hematocrit remained stable at approximately 28 to 30 throughout her hospital stay.
Her initial anemia workup was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
She was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on the day prior to discharge and her hematocrit bumped appropriately to 31.
B-12 and folate studies were pending at the time of discharge.
She received daily betadine dressings and application of 4 by 4 gauze pads.
She was cleared by physical therapy prior to discharge and will be seeking cardiac rehab at [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital.
