Diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 to 2.2).
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 6.7, her hematocrit was 35.8, and her platelets were 187.
Chemistry-7 revealed her sodium was 146, potassium was 3.9, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 36 (baseline 33 to 38), blood urea nitrogen was 38, creatinine was 1.9 (baseline 1 to 1.9), and her blood glucose was 108.
Alanine-aminotransferase was 22.
Her aspartate aminotransferase was 18.
Pulmonary function tests done in [**2132-4-20**] showed an FVC of 40% of predicted, FEV1 of 44% or predicted, and FEV1:FVC ratio of 110% of predicted.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was positive for signs of congestive heart failure.
An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, poor R wave progression, and normal axis.
An echocardiogram in [**2133-1-19**] showed left atrial enlargement, an ejection fraction of 55%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild right ventricular dilation, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension.
Initially, the patient was tried on intravenous Lasix at varying doses with the assistance of afterload reduction, and angiotensin receptor blocker, and heart rate control, and a beta blocker.
The angiotensin receptor blocker was discontinued as her creatinine continued to increase.
Her blood pressure returned with the help of dopamine.
On multiple repeat chest x-rays the patient showed increasing pulmonary congestion.
OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA/RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE/OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient's body habitus caused multiple problems in her pulmonary function; including bicarbonate retention, likely from her body habitus causing some restrictive disease.
The doses were altered throughout her hospital stay, and her goal heart rate is likely in the 60s to 70s.
The patient's target partial thromboplastin time was in the lower therapeutic range given her history of guaiac-positive stools.
The patient have guaiac-positive stools during her hospitalization; however, she was never hemodynamically unstable, and her hematocrit remained near her baseline throughout.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.2 to 1.9.
The patient's creatinine slowly increased during diuresis and caused some limitation in our ability to diurese.
The patient's vancomycin was dosed by levels to achieve random levels of greater than 15.
The patient's surveillance cultures were all negative.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  Given the patient is Jehovah Witness and does not accept blood products, close monitoring of her hematocrit was done.
