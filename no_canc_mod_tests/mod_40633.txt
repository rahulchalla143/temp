Patient was seen in the ED [**10-7**] after scheduled visit with NP on [**10-7**] where patient was found have HR in 140s.
In ED yesterday pt was in Afib with rates in 60s at that time, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw patient who agreed with plan to send home, with [**Doctor Last Name **] of hearts holter monitor and add 12.5mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] to her medications (in addition to her home verapamil SR 240mg AM and dronedarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]).
This admission, in the ED, initial vitals were 98.2, 65, 102/81, 16, 97% on 2L NC.
EKG showed Afib with rate in the 30s-40s and SBP dropped to the 80s-90s.
She was given glucagon 0.5mg (to reverse BB), calcium gluconate 1g (to reverse CCB) without response, Dopamine added which increasd HR to 60s and SBPs to 100s.
Repeat CXR showed mild worsening of congestion.
In CCU: HR 65, BP 104/65, SaO2 98% on 5L, on 8mcg of Dopamine.
Family History: Mother with MI at 59, brother with h/o cardiac arrest, father with h/o CHF; brother with h/o afib  Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: VS: HR 65, BP 104/65, SaO2 98% on NRB or 5L, on 5mcg of Dopamine GENERAL: Looks stated age, twitching, nauseous, complaining of foley pain.
LUNGS: Crackles b/l 1/2 up, requiring NRB although speaking in full sentences and not using accessory muscles.
Able to take shower with no SOB and O2 sat 95%.

Imaging [**2203-10-17**] CXR ReportCONCLUSION: 1.
ECG [**10-15**]: Atrial paced rhythm.
ECHO [**10-10**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Discharge:  [**2203-10-17**] 07:06AM BLOOD WBC-7.8 RBC-3.41* Hgb-8.9* Hct-28.1* MCV-82 MCH-26.2* MCHC-31.8 RDW-16.5* Plt Ct-256 [**2203-10-17**] 07:06AM BLOOD Glucose-94 UreaN-23* Creat-1.3* Na-138 K-4.2 Cl-101 HCO3-28 AnGap-13  Brief Hospital Course: 89 yo female with h/o pAfib, CAD, who presented to ED with weakness, found to be bradycardic to 30s-40s and MAPs of 50s, and hypoxemic with SaO2 in 80s requiring Dopamine and NRB.
Etiologies include new medications (recent addition of Metoprolol), MI (no s/s on EKG and neg enzymes), Infection (no fever, +leukocytosis), metabolic disturbances (electrolytes wnl).
Echo was checked that was not concerning.
It was noted that the patient's QTc was ~ 500msec, which prompted disucssion of PPM.
Crackles appreciated 1/2 up B/L and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.
Patient with some crackles continued, CXR that showed small/moderate R pleural effusion and only mild interstial edema.
CXR on day of discharge showed improved pulm edema and increased RLL atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
Finding on CXR clinically most likely atelectasis.
EF > 55% in from [**2200**].
We continued ASA 81, Atorva 20, EKGs were trended, Echo repeated and showed EF 55%, and severe TR.
Information was obtained from webOMR.
For this reason, a pacemaker was inserted to keep your heart rate from going very slow on the medicines.
