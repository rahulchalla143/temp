EMS vitals reported as BP 220/100 with pulse of 68, RR 18, Oxygen 96%/RA, blood sugar 97.
She was noted to be initially awake and alert with temp 97.6, BP 240/100, P 63, RR 20.
CT scan of her head demonstrated a 2.2x1.8 left thalamic hemorrhage with extension into the left lateral ventricle.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], BP 240/100, HR 60-70, temp 98.0.
BP ranged from 99-256 systolic.
Pertinent Results: [**2130-1-25**] 02:15PM   WBC-14.2* RBC-4.89 HGB-15.2 HCT-44.6 MCV-91 MCH-31.1 MCHC-34.0 RDW-12.9 [**2130-1-25**] 02:15PM   NEUTS-67 BANDS-12* LYMPHS-17* MONOS-3 EOS-1 BASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0 [**2130-1-25**] 02:15PM   GLUCOSE-181* UREA N-14 CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-4.0 CHLORIDE-99 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-18 [**2130-1-25**] 02:15PM   PLT COUNT-303 [**2130-1-25**] 02:15PM   PT-12.9 PTT-22.6 INR(PT)-1.0 ----- Non-contrast Head CT [**2130-1-25**]: FINDINGS: A large approximately 3 cm left thalamic hyperdensity is noted, with extension into the left lateral ventricle.
----- Non-contrast Head CT [**2130-1-26**]: There has been no significant interval change in the left thalamic hemorrahge with extension of blood to the left lateral ventricle.
The ventricles are stable in size since the prior examination with mild dilatation of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
----- Non-contrast Head CT [**2130-1-28**]: FINDINGS: The left thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension is unchanged in size.
----- Non-contrast Head CT [**2130-2-2**]: FINDINGS: The left thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extension into the lateral ventricles is unchanged in size.
The right-sided ventricular drain is still in place, however, in the interval, there is increased intraparenchymal hemorrhage around the drain, especially in the right frontal region.
Head CT demonstrates 3 cm left thalamic hyperdensity with extension into left lateral ventricle.
Blood pressure goal was less than 160 systolic; initially, she was maintained on Labetalol drip.
Serial head CTs showed stable size and extension of her hemorrhage.
Post drain placement, CT scan demonstrated hemorrhage around the drain track in the right frontal lobe.
Follow up head CT on [**2130-2-3**] showed stable size of ventricles and hemorrhage.
Sputum sample on [**2130-1-27**] demonstrated Streptococcus pneumoniae.
From a cardiac standpoint, she ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
Blood pressure was initially controlled with a Labetalol drip.
