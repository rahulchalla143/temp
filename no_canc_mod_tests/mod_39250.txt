She had a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 70560**] for HAP; during that admission, she was treated for HAP x2.
Per [**Hospital1 1501**], CXR showed RLL PNA, and she has been running low grade temps of 99.
Her EKG showed rapid Afib, no other changes.
Her CXR showed RLL pneumonia very similar to previous CXR.
She was given diltiazem 10mg IV x1 for afib with RVR, and HR improved to 90s.
ABG showed 7.16/72/87/27.

Right Pleural Fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CTA chest [**2103-1-17**]: Although this study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, images of the upper abdomen demonstrate reflux of contrast into the intrahepatic IVC and hepatic veins, and an apparent filling defect in the intrahepatic IVC.
However, further evaluation with ultrasound of the intrahepatic IVC is recommended to exclude clot.
CT head without contrast [**2103-1-17**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
[**2103-1-18**] MR head w/o contrast IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-12-5**], the left atrial mass appears new.
This focused study did not [**Year (4 digits) 4656**] valvular structure and function or ventricular function.
[**2103-1-17**] MRI head There is no evidence of hemorrhage or areas of slow diffusion to suggest acute infarction.
CXR ([**2103-1-26**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-23**], there has been substantial decrease in the right pleural effusion.
She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and CTA chest was negative for PE but showed a question of a LLL PNA and sputum grew MSSA.
Thoracentesis in the intensive care unit yielded serosanguinous fluid 850cc which was concerning for malignancy, cytology was negative.
Her pleural effusion was drained for 800 cc in the intensive care unit and her breathing did improve.
Culture from the first drainage remained negative.
Her weight should be monitored carefully and lasix titrated to keep her weight stable so that she does not accumulate any fluid.
Of note, it is very important that she continue to receive oxygen therapy for her pulmonary hypertension as well as her COPD in order to maintain her oxygen saturations above 92%.
- continue O2 to maintain sats >92%, she should have oxygen at all times.
# Left atrial thrombus - A CTA was done on admission that was negative for a pulmonary embolism but did show a question of a left atrial thrombus versus mass.
A TTE was then performed but this was unable to distinguish between an atrial thrombus and an atrial mass.
This issue was discussed with the TEE fellow, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 95245**], who spoke with the echo attending.
They felt that given the fact that Ms. [**Known lastname 17926**] had an echocardiogram 1-month ago that was negative for this clot/mass, that it was most consistent with a clot and not a mass.
A TEE would be very difficult to obtain in this patient and would require a pediatric probe.
As such, she was scheduled to see a cardiologist in follow-up and will have an echocardiogram at that time to ensure the clot has resolved.
When her INR is greater than 2, the heparin drip can be discontinued and she should continue on coumadin until she sees the cardiologist.
# Atrial fibrillation w/rvr - The patient's heart rate was only poorly controlled with her home regimen.
On these doses of medications, her heart rate was well controlled.
was noted to have anisocoria on day after admission which appeared to be new, she was evaluated by neurology and MRI head was negative for acute infarction.
Her anisocoria is most likely [**1-3**] a horner's syndrome [**1-3**] trauma from intubation.
# DM - Her finger sticks were initially well controlled on sliding scale insulin.
Her weight should be monitored carefully and attempts should be made to keep her euvolemic .
