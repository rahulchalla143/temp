They also did a CT chest w/contrast to rule out a dissecting aortic aneurysm given her description of the pain.
An ABG at OSH showed a respiratory alkalosis.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.
She had an expiratory wheeze that was felt to be forced due to her tachypnia.
A creatinine was uptrending 0.6 -> 0.9 and a lactate was 8.1.
A chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and bilateral pulmonary effusions.
A FAST exam (modified because sitting up) but has some fluid in bilateral lower abdominal quadrants which was felt to be more than just physiologic.
Her VS at the prior to transfer were hr 138 rr 26 sat 97/30% BP 129/70.

Given her Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, chest pain and the acute onset of these symptoms, she had a CTA which was negative for aortic dissection.
LENIs were negative for DVT and as above, CTA chest negative for PE.
She was briefly on a heparin gtt until the chest CT results came back.
Echo showed very small pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade physiology.
A bedside ultrasound does not show any significant drainable pockets of fluid.
Bladder pressure was 14-16 which was reassuring.
Initial set of cardiac enzymes negative.
UA potentially consistent with UTI however asymptomatic so will await urine cultures and not treat empirically.
Initally there was concern over a pulmonary embolism and you were on a heparin drip, but repeat studies were negative and this was discontinued.
