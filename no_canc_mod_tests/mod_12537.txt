Cardiac Catheterization Report COMMENTS: 1.
Selective conduit angiography of the radial-OM1 graft was patent to the OM1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systemic systolic arterial hypertension, with central aortic pressure of 148/85, mean 111 mmHg.
Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease unchanged since coronary angiography in [**2205**].
Echo The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is grossly preserved (LVEF ?50-55%?).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2205-11-23**], mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now more prominent.
