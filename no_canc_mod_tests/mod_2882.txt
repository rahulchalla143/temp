At that time, it was unclear if there was a unilateral focus and we discussed extensively whether or not to proceed with invasive monitoring or simply to approach the right temporal cavernous malformation, which was discovered on his MRI.
Sensory exam is grossly intact.
ON DISCHARGE nonfocal incision c/d/i with staples in place  Pertinent Results: [**2135-2-18**] MRI - 1.
Evaluation of residual cavernoma is limited due to postoperative changes in that area in the right temporal lobe.
Suggest repeat study in four weeks to rule out any residual tumor after postoperative changes have resolved.
His postoperative imaging showed minimal pneumocephalus, no acute hemorrhage or infarct.
Post operative exam remained nonfocal.
