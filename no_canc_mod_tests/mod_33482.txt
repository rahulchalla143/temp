She also received Valium 10mg prn CIWA > 10.
We monitored her hematocrit which was stable.
Hepatic serologies were all negative.
We monitored her liver function tests, which were relatively stable.
After consulting endocrine, we attributed this to her thyrotoxicosis, which can cause a transient transaminitis.
A TSH was not measurable.
She was discharged on 20 mg of methimazole qd and propranolol, with follow up in 1 week to check her LFTs and blood counts (due to risk of agranulocytosis with methimazole).
Estradiol-Norethindrone Acet 0.05-0.14 mg/24 hr Patch Semiweekly Sig: One (1) Patch Semiweekly Transdermal every seventy-two (72) hours.
Further testing also revealed changes in your Grave's Disease, which may have also contributed to your symptoms.
