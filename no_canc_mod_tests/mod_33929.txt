CT A/P ([**2142-4-15**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
A renal ultrasound or MRI may be obtained for further characterization the the 3cm indeterminate lesion as the patient's clinical condition warrants.
Echo ([**2142-4-20**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CTA Torso ([**2142-4-20**]): 1.
Limited evaluation of the subsegmental branches on the left and the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right pulmonary arteries secondary to bolus timing.
Indeterminate 3 cm cystic lesion exophytic off the upper pole of the left kidney in addition to multiple bilateral renal cysts, which are redemonstrated.
A renal ultrasound or MRI may be obtained for further characterization as previously recommended on an outpatient basis.
The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
CT Abd ([**2142-4-27**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Echo ([**2142-4-30**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function appears normal (LVEF 50-60%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-4-20**], no definite [**Doctor Last Name **].
If indicated, a TEE would be better to exclude a small valvular vegetation.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CT Abd ([**2142-5-4**]) Markedly limited IV bolus timing secondary to hand injection, particularly limiting evaluation of potential vascular complication.
KUB ([**2142-5-6**]) - Two portable views of the abdomen were obtained, both supine.
The appearance is in keeping with the appearance on the CT scout film from [**2142-5-4**].
CXR ([**2142-5-10**]) - Lung volumes are very low, crowding all of the normal structures and abnormalities.
CXR ([**2142-5-11**])- 1.
Enlargement of the cardiopericardial silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged, and likely related to volume overload/congestive heart failure.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT ABD/PELVIS (pancreas protocol- [**2142-5-14**])- 1.
Incidental note of intestinal distension  CXR ([**2142-5-14**])- No acute cardiopulmonary process.
CT imaging revealed a partially-necrosed pancreas with a fluid collection.
Repeat imaging showed no evidence of progression of necrotic pancreas or other any intra-abdominal process.
The patient was followed with serial CT scans of his pancreas, which ultimately showed extensive pancreatic necrosis.
When blood pressue was stable and he was able to be diuresed, he began to require less positive pressure.
Dead space measurement did not reveal a significant amount of dead space present, and he was able to increasingly tolerate pressure support.
At the time of discharge he is slighly positive for length of stay.
Eventually, he grew coag neg staph sensitive to linezolid in consecutive blood cultures from [**Date range (1) 71614**] and then coag neg staph that was resistant to linezolid in a blood culture on [**5-3**].
Additionally, he grew pan-sensitive enterococcus faecalis in consecutive blood cultures from [**Date range (1) 40693**].
Also, he grew acinetobacter from a right IJ blood cx on [**5-3**] and from multiple sputum cultures.
Biopsies were performed and were also consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction.
However, stool samples were eventually negative for C. diff.
His ileus improved after weaning narcotics and a few doses of methylnaltrexone.
The etiology was likely multifactoiral, including his pancreatitis, his bacteremia, and his sedation while he was intubated.
His hospital course was complicated by some additional elevations in his creatining, generally in the setting of CT scans.
At the time of discharge, his creatinine was stable and within normal limits.
ANEMIA Patient's hematocrit slowely trended down during his hospitalization.
His hematocrit was trended and he was transfused PRN to maintain a HCT above 21.
His blood counts had been stable for several days prior to discharge.
