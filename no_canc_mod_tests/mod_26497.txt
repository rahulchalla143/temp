A non non-contrast CT scan suggested Type A dissection and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for for further evaluation.
[**2180-3-23**] Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
IMPRESSION: There is an aneurysm/ulcer of the ascending aorta (seen best on images # 56-62.
No dissection is seen (trans-thoracic echo cannot exclude).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-3-22**], the prior study was a TEE and showed this area more clearly.
If this is consistent with the clinical finding, CT should be obtained.

His MRI showed MCA/PCA territory infarction on his R side.
He was not felt to be a candidate for an intervention as his vertebral clot could break off and cause basilar occlusion if attempted to be intervened on and no other clots were identified on vessel imaging.
His BUN and creatinine were also noted to be elevated at 25/1.5, likely due to exposure to a significant amount of contrast during the catheterization.
A head CT revealed a question of a new infarct by radiology read, but the neurology service felt it was largely unchanged.
On the following morning he began to develop persistent fevers, his white blood cell count decreased from normal to 3.5, and his abdomen was noted to be distended.
A urine analysis returned positive so he was placed on cipro.
A KUB revealed possible air under the left hemidiaphram.
General surgery was called and an abdominal CT was recommended, however on talking with the family, they did not wish to pursue surgery under any circumstances.
