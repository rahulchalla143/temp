Cytology did not show malignant cells and stains for AFB, viral, fungal, bacterial, gram stain were all negative (2+ PMNs).
Her SOB greatly improved and she was treated with azithro and cefpodoxime for RUL opacities on admission CT and history of MAC (dx [**2134**], never treated, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] as outpt) for a total of 7 days, as well as oxygen and nebs at home.
CXR was done which showed RML opacity and bilateral effusions.
She was seen in clinic and d/t respiratory distress was had CT of chest which showed new PNA in RUL and increasing bilateral effusions.
Serial ABG's showed worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia, she become more somnolent, and was transferred to MICU.

CT [**2135-2-24**]: IMPRESSION:  New pneumonia in the upper lobes.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt was admitted to the OMED service from clinic for further work-up and care.
An ABG was significant for a significant respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis that appeared to be more chronic in nature.
She was placed on IV vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin to broadly cover for a nosocomial PNA that was visualized on CXR and CT on admission.
She also underwent a L thoracocentesis that was not significant for an empyema and cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Although PE was on the differential, this was thought to be unlikely as she was on anti-coagulation for PAF as an outpt.
She will f/u with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-19**] days for a general check-up and to check her CBC and INR.
Release 24HR(s)* Refills:*2* 4.
You will need to have the following blood work checked: CBC and INR in addition to a regular check-up.
