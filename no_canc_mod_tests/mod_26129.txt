She [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] right heart catheterization on [**2126-12-6**] that showed pulmonary hypertension (systolic BP 45, diastolic BP 20, mean BP 28).
A repeat urine culture was obtained for followup on [**1-2**] although she was afebrile and had no urinary complaints.
This culture again grew out Pseudomonas, this time quinolone resistant.
Her hypotension was thought to reflect both aggressive diuresis and possible urosepsis.
C. diff colitis: She experienced loose stools after admission and a stool sample was positive for C. diff toxin on [**12-8**]; she was subsequently treated with a 14 day course of flagyl.
Her anticoagulation was discontinued in the setting of heme positive stools and widely varying INR (thought likely to be due to interactions with her many medications).
A repeat ultrasound of the upper extremity showed no evidence of persistent thrombus therefore she was not continued on further anticoagulation.
Elevated LFTs: Her transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were moderately elevated and thought to be secondary to GVHD of the liver after review of her medication list and right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no other clear causes of these findings.
Her alkaline phosphatase elevation was probably due at least in part to her bony disease as the bone specific fraction was elevated as well.
Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine was 1.3 at admission peaking at 1.9.
Her creatinine improved with addition of albumin to her diuretic regimen consistent with this.
Pulmonary hypertension: Ms. [**Known lastname 28331**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] right heart catheterization on [**12-7**] to assess whether pulmonary hypertension might be contributing to her significant edema.
This study showed mean pulmonary pressures of 28 and she was subsequently started on sildenafil, which was subsequently d/c'd upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (see above).
She was started on a PPI and her Hct was followed closely.
Her vitamin D levels were rechecked and found to be low.
She will need repeat vitamin D studies and should follow up with endocrinology for further management.
The endocrinology service reviewed the films and felt the history and imaging were most consistent with pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
