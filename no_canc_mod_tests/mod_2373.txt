Admission Date:  [**2129-3-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2101-1-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2067-10-24**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30% presenting with short of breath and fatigue for two days.
She was noted to be in atrial flutter with a heart rate in the 140s and blood pressure 69/42.
Her baseline blood pressure is 80 systolic.
She was also noted at [**Hospital3 628**] to have grossly Guaiac-positive black stool, an INR of 13, and a hematocrit of 21.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature afebrile, heart rate 140s, blood pressure 80/palpable, respirations 15, saturating 100% on 4 liters.
JVP at 10 cm.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.2, hematocrit 26.0, platelets 65,000.
INR 9.0.
Sodium 136, potassium 4.9, chloride 103, bicarbonate 18, BUN 70, creatinine 1.8, glucose 67.
AST 29, ALT 34, alkaline phosphatase 82, total bilirubin 0.2, albumin 3.3, total protein 6.7.
EKG showed atrial tachycardia at a rate of 145, left bundle branch block, T wave inversion in II, III, and aVF, V4 through V6.
She was loaded on Amiodarone during her first hospital stay and DC cardioverted into a completely AV paced rhythm at a rate of 60.
She was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells on her first day of admission for a hematocrit of 21 which bumped her appropriately.
Likely her GI bleed is in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR and thrombocytopenia, both of which were corrected during her hospital stay and her hematocrit remained stable, although she will likely need follow-up EGD/push enteroscopy if she does not have it during this hospitalization.
ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY:  Her ejection fraction is 25-30%.
She initially required a larger dose of dopamine at 10 and has been titrated down to her home dose of 8 with good blood pressure control with a systolic from 80-100s.
The patient will continue on a 2 gram sodium diet, have daily weights.
HISTORY OF SEPTIC PULMONARY EMBOLI SECONDARY TO LINE INFECTION:  The patient has had this from a prior admission from [**Month (only) 956**] of this year when blood cultures grew both Nocardia and a gram-negative rod nonfermenter not further identified.
