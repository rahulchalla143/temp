She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation and treatment.
Upon being transferred and en route via [**Location (un) **], she dropped her blood pressure to the 90s but responded adequately with fluid resuscitation.
Once the patient arrived to the emergency room trauma bay, a chest x-ray revealed  bilateral subcutaneous emphysema, raising a high suspicion for pneumothoraces, given the history of the rib fractures as well.
The patient's blood pressure was about 130/palp and upon being rolled up and after the adequate labs were obtained, she was transferred to CT scan and head, neck, check, abdomen and pelvis CT were obtained.
She had a cervical II fracture, categorized as a type III odontoid fracture.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable as these studies were obtained and urgent Neurosurgery and Orthopedics Spine consults were obtained.
By this time, the initial labs came back and revealed a white count of 27,000, hematocrit 31, platelets 307,000.
Her sodium was 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 109, CO2 19, BUN 25, creatinine 0.8, glucose 155.
Her INR was 1.2, PT 13.4, with a PTT of 27 and a lactate of 1.4.
Her gas was 7.50, CO2 24, O2 268, bicarbonate 19, with a base excess of -2.
The next serial hematocrit, about half an hour later, came back at 26 and the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
The pressure was still not high.
An additional right femoral Cordis was placed and the patient dropped her blood pressure to the 70s systolic.
She was placed emergently in Trendelenburg position and bolused with IV fluids as well as the remainder of the packed red blood cells.
The CT Surgical team was contact[**Name (NI) **] once again and made aware of this increase in the CT drainage.
At that point, the left chest tube had drained about 900 cc of blood and was still draining bright red blood into the canister.
A new hematocrit was obtained, as well as coagulation studies which revealed a hematocrit of 26 despite about five units of packed red blood cells that were already infused.
An INR was 1.4, PT 14.8, PTT 33.0, with fibrinogen of 101.
Upon reviewing the patient's case, the blood pressure of this unfortunate woman dropped once again to the 70s and this time, despite positioning changes and an additional five units of packed red blood cells for a total of ten, and one unit of fresh frozen plasma, the patient's blood pressure did not recover.
The recommendation from the CT Surgical team was unanimous in not doing any heroic maneuvers as no potential repair could have been done in light of the patient's neurosurgical injury.
The thoracotomy kit was ready in the room and the team full-gowned but upon reviewing the situation it was decided not to proceed with the emergent thoracotomy.
After 20 minutes of active coding, performing CPR as well as providing medications, there was still no blood pressure and the O2 saturations were in the low 60s despite full ventilatory support on 100 percent FIO2.
