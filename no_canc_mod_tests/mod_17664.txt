He received a CT of the head which showed a large right-sided subdural hemorrhage with some subarachnoid hemorrhage as well.
His skin was closed over his brain parenchyma and he was sent back to the Intensive Care Unit in critical condition.
The patient did not meet apnea [**Doctor Last Name **] protocol nor did he ever have a cerebral profusion scan to show that he had evidence of brain death.
However, follow-up CT postoperatively showed evidence of uncal herniation.
Due to blood pressure control with intravenous drips and serial CT scans, after extensive discussions with the family, ultimately the decision for withdrawal of care was decided upon by the family once the patient demonstrated no obvious neurological recovery.
The remainder of the patient's radiographic surveys and laboratory tests are of little importance given the severity of his primary brain injury.
His postmortem examination will be completed by the medical examiner's office once his DCD is completed.
