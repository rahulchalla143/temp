Patient then went to [**Hospital1 43954**],  where  her blood pressure was found to be 60/palp.
Echocardiogram  there  was  consistent  with  an effusion.
She  was  given  2  liters  of normal saline and started  on dopamine and transferred to [**Hospital1 36918**] Emergency Room, where a repeat echocardiogram showed   a   moderate-size   effusion,  but  no  evidence  of tamponade.
SOCIAL  HISTORY:    No tobacco or alcohol use, lives alone at home, has no children  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile, blood pressure 124/55  on dopamine, pulse 68, respirations 20, O2 saturation 96%  on  4  liters.
Neutrophils 89, bands  2, sodium 141, potassium 4.2, chloride 111, bicarb 14, BUN  13,  creatinine 0.7, glucose 162, calcium 7.3, magnesium 1.8,  phosphorus  2.8.
INR  2.0, PTT 31.2, ALT 73, AST 64, alkaline   phosphatase  80,  lipase  33,  amylase  24,  total bilirubin 0.7.
Urinalysis  significant  for 6 to 10 white blood cells, small leukocyte esterase.
2) 63, troponin less than 0.3 times two.
Arterial blood gas:  pH 7.38, CO2 29, O2 74, lactate 2.0.
Electrocardiogram:    Atrial fibrillation with a rate of 109, normal axis, Q wave in lead 3, no acute ST or T wave changes.
Head CT scan:  No mass, no shift or bleed.
No IV fluids were needed and her  pressures  were now in the systolic blood pressure range of  the  130s.
Repeat echocardiogram showed no change in the size   of  her  pericardial  effusion  with  no  evidence  of tamponade.
However,  there  was a note made that there was perforation of the right ventricular free wall with the pacer wire  on  repeat echocardiogram on [**6-29**].
The following day, patient had a repeat echocardiogram, which confirmed these findings.
At the time of discharge, patient's pressure was normotensive and her O2 saturation was 94 to 95% on room air, including on ambulation.
