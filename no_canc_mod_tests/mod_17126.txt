Upon arrival GCS was 3, the patient was noted to have abrasions on the face and found to have decorticate posturing.
Labs were wnl.
CT of the head revealed multiple small punctate hemorrhages and small subdural hematoma and bilateral maxillary fractures.
Repeat head CT was stable with no obvious explanation of the patients symptoms.
An MRI was obtained which revelead  multiple foci of slow diffusion with corresponding high signal on T2-weighted images and increased susceptibility on gradient echo images in the subcortical and periventricular whitematter of both frontal lobes and the left temporal lobe, consistent with hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury.
A focus of slow diffusion and high T2 signal posterior to the left lentiform nucleus, without any increased susceptibility on gradient echo images, is consistent with nonhemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury.
Small bilateral subdural hygromas are present, as noted on the preceding CT scan.
Followup CXR revealed a small residula PTX which was found to have resolved on subsequent imaging.
