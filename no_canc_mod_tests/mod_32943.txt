On [**2168-12-26**] he was admitted to the ICU at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and underwent a colonoscopy that day which showed diverticuli but did not reveal any active bleeding.
On [**12-26**] his HCT dropped from 31.3 to 27.7 and he was give PRBCs.
The night of [**12-27**] he had more BRBPR and his HCT drifted down to 26, but he remained hemodynamically stable.
On [**12-28**] he underwent another colonoscopy with no localized source of bleeding but did show a large amount of blood in the colon.
Also in the course of the work up of his GI bleed he underwent a CTA of his abdomen on [**12-28**] with no active GI bleeding seen.
Got total of 7 units PRBC to maintain Hct ~ 27 throughout his stay at [**Hospital1 18**], Surgery was also consulted who agreed with the CTA and recommended a transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] if the family wished to pursue a further work up or aggressive treatment such as angio for embolization or surgical resection.
Also during his stay at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] given his history of systolic heart failure and murmur heard on exam he had an echocardiogram which showed an improvement in his EF to 55%, but significantly worsening of his aortic stenosis.
His AS was previously characterized as mild but was found to be severe with a valve area of 0.8 to 1.0 cm2.

Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON for ADMISSION 83 y/o M with a h/o AF not on coumadin, CHF with an EF of 20%, severe AS, RA (chronic prednisone 5), CKD (baseline Cr around 1.3) and ?
COPD on advair who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with BRBPR 7 likely [**3-9**] to a sigmoid diverticular bleed, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Colonoscopy at [**Location (un) 620**] were suggestive of bleeding from sigmiod diverticuli.
HCT was monitored and remained statble between 28 and 30.
Patient was noted to be intermittently hypotensive with SBPs in the 70s which responded to bolus IVFs with improvement to the 90s-100s.
ID was consulted, recommended repeat TTE to rule out vegetations (negative) and course of 4 weeks ceftriaxone 1g q24hours (through [**1-31**]).
# Diastolic CHF: Echo at OSH with EF of 55%, LVEF confirmed on echo here with evidence of grade 1 diastolic dysfunction.
# Aortic stenosis: Last echo in [**2166**] showed mild AS, however echo on this admission shiwed EF 55%, severe AS (valve area 0.8-1.O cm2), LVH, 1+ MR/TR.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine at [**Location (un) 620**] was 1.4 on admission.
Creatinine improved to 1.1 with admistration of blood products and remained stable throughout the remainder of his hospital course.
First due: [**1-16**] - Pancreatic mass: incidentally found on CT, will need further evaluation with if more work up is desired.
Pending results: acid fast culture from shoulder joint.
