Infant emerged with a spontaneous cry and respirations, given blow by oxygen and bulb suctioning, the newborn had Apgars of 7 at one minute and 8 at five minutes of age.
Admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and stabilization, the baby was transferred to [**Hospital3 18242**] shortly thereafter due to increased census in the NICU.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, weight 1,060 gm, (25th to 50th percentile).
Length 38 cm (50th percentile), head circumference 27.5 cm (50th to 75th percentile).
A non dysmorphic preterm infant, the baby was noted to have coarse bilateral breath sounds that were equal bilaterally.
Cardiac exam had irregular rate and rhythm, without murmur auscultated.
Red reflexes were visualized bilaterally.
Her chest radiograph was consistent with respiratory distress syndrome.
An echocardiogram on day of life #3 confirmed closure of the patent ductus arteriosus.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  Parenteral nutrition was started on day of life #2.
Maximum total fluids of 160 cc per kilo per day were needed.
Their evaluation showed a poor coordinated suck, swallow and breathing as well as signs of oral aversion, potentially related to her neurologic status.
Upper GI series was done on [**11-23**] in preparation for a G tube placement.
Gastrointestinal:  Phototherapy was started on day of life #2 and advanced to triple phototherapy with a peak bilirubin of 10.4 on day of life #6.
Phototherapy was discontinued on [**9-4**] with a rebound bilirubin of 2.8 on [**9-7**].
Hematology:  Having received multiple red blood cell transfusions in the first week of life as well as FFP in the setting of a pulmonary hemorrhage, [**Known lastname **] was last transfused with packed red blood cells on day of life #54, given a hematocrit of 24% and a reticulocyte count at that time of 7.4.
Her last hematocrit on [**11-29**] was 30.7%.
Surveillance surface cultures were positive for Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus on [**9-14**].
Recent surface cultures have been negative.
A progressive increase in her head circumference prompted a follow-up head ultrasound on [**10-9**] which showed increasing ventricular size.
Her last head ultrasound on [**11-19**] showed resolution of the ventriculomegaly and resolution of hemorrhage in the lateral ventricles with a resolving clot in the third ventricle.
The study also showed normal brain parenchymal echogenicity.
Head circumference on [**12-8**] was 35 cm which has been stable.
The baby has had multiple newborn screening tests sent with the most recent one in her medical records as of 6 weeks of age on [**2111-9-30**] which showed normal findings apart from hemoglobin testing which was unable to be tested secondary to the baby being transfused.
Prematurity at 28 2/7 weeks gestation.
