TWO-VIEW CHEST X-RAY of [**2192-8-16**].
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Conclusions: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Trace MR and no signofocant gradient.
On postoperative day [**1-15**], continued with aggressive diuresis, transfused with packed red blood cell for hematocrit 21, pain management, chest tube and epicardial wires removed.
