Of note, he was apparently seen by his primary care physician in the Emergency Department on [**2142-10-20**], for complaints of shaking in the right arm, slurred speech, had no significant findings on physical examination and was sent home.
The patient had a magnetic resonance scan performed that showed abnormal T2 signal hyperintensity within the left frontoparietal junction which involves the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter consistent with an acute infarct.
MRA showed visualization of left middle cerebral artery and one segment but no cortical branches.
Finger extensors are 5-/5 on the right with full power in the interossei.
Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally.
Finger to nose testing is accurate.
The patient then on [**2142-10-27**], underwent a carotid ultrasound and a transthoracic echocardiogram.
Noninvasive carotid study showed narrowing of less than 40% bilaterally of the internal carotid arteries and the patient's transthoracic echocardiogram was within normal limits with no evidence of thrombogenic area.
The Transesophageal Echocardiography service came by on [**2142-10-30**], and documented in the chart that the patient's transthoracic echocardiogram was an adequate study and that there was no indication to proceed to a Transesophageal Echocardiogram as they say based on the clinical scenario and evidence obtained on the transthoracic echocardiogram.
They will also decide if the patient needs to undergo a Transesophageal Echocardiogram.
