Neck CT ([**5-16**]) decmonstrated 8mm oval L cerebellar lesion.
Repeat head CT on [**5-18**] and then on [**5-26**] demonstrated same nonenhancing lesion unchanged from [**5-16**] involving the cerebellar peduncle with some extension into the pons.
Bl Cx in [**Hospital1 18**] from [**5-13**] remained negative.
Evaluation of his delerium was complicated by the patient's unwillingness to cooperate with the neurologic and mental status exam secondary to frustration with the hospital staff and depression.
Serial CTs of the head with contrast demonstrated normal evolution of the infarct without evidence of a cerebellar abscess.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE At the end of his hospital stay, Mr. [**Known lastname 52461**] developed acute renal failure secondary to dehydration (based on calculated FENa = 0.8%, physical exam findings consistent with dehydration and reversal of rising Cr with rehydration).
His baseline Creatinine is 0.9.
His LISINOPRIL, LASIX, AND METFORMIN were held pending normalization of his renal function.
Please contact his primary care physcian and see "Hospital Course Section - ACUTE RENAL FAILURE" before restarting these medications.
Do not restart your lasix, lisinopril or metformin until your physician instructs you to OR UNTIL YOUR SERUM CREATININE IS <1.0 (See Hospital Course section on "ACUTE RENAL FAILURE" for details.
Contact your physician if temperature >100, becomes very short of breath, becomes more confused.
Please check INR weekly for appropriate anticoagulation (INR=2.5-3.5)  Please ask your physician when it is appropriate to restart your lasix.
PHONE: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 12124**] to obtain an appointment for pulmonary function testing if you have not had this recently in the past.
