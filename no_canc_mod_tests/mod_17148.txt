RADIOLOGY: CT head - FINDINGS: There is a rounded area of hyperdensity within the right aspect of the pons consistent with acute hemorrhage which measures 1.5 x 1.6 cm.
Head CT: Findings consistent with parenchymal hemorrhage in the right aspect of the pons as described above with mass effect upon the right aspect of the fourth ventricle, however, the fourth ventricle remains patent.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with ventricular response, rate 85-90.
Generalized non-specific repolarization changes, cannot exclude possible inferior myocardial infarction.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 91 0 88 374/422.71 0 -13 -95 .
MRI brain w/ or w/o contrast: Again noted is an acute hematoma in the right aspect of the pons involving the middle cerebellar peduncle with mass effect on the fourth ventricle which is displaced to the left.
On the gradient echo images, there are foci of punctate susceptibility dropout in bilateral cerebellum, bilateral temporal lobes, bilateral frontal lobes and basal ganglia/thalami.
Head CT [**3-1**]: FINDINGS: As before, there is an intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the right aspect of the pons posteriorly and extending into the mid brain as well as the right cerebellar hemisphere.
head ct [**3-4**]: NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: The extent of hemorrhage and associated edema in the right midbrain, pons, and cerebellum is unchanged, with unchanged compression of the fourth ventricle and unchanged dilatation of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles.
There are no CT signs of an acute infarction.
Compared to prior study dated [**2107-3-8**], cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged with top sized heart.
Her admission exam was notable for ability to follow axial and appendicular commands, symmetric and reactive pupils, a hypotropic R eye, a conjugate gaze paralysis with difficulty crossing midline on rightward gaze, R UMN facial droop, and decreased left sided strength with L arm antigravity but ataxic, L leg anti-gravity and right arm purposeful and leg antigravity.
Her CT revealed a right pontine hemorrhage slightly involving the lower midbrain with compression of R 4th ventricle.
An MR brain without and with contrast showed foci of punctate susceptibility dropout on gradient echo in multiple bilateral territories including the brainstem suggestive of either microbleeds or cavernous angiomas, and in particular, a left frontal venous angioma.
Repeat head CT showed associated edema in the midbrain, but her examination remained unchanged afterwards.
Blood pressure was controlled as below.
Exam was notable for mild catatonia, for which *** neuroleptic medications are to be avoided if possible.
Hypertension: Her blood pressure was controlled initially with a labetolol drip and PRN hydralazine for target SBP < 160, DBP < 105, and MAP < 130.
This was later changed to metoprolol, diltiazem, and lisinopril with good blood pressure control.
As her rates remained elevated, she was started on digoxin and with full dose metoprolol, diltiazem and digoxin her heart rate improved significantly.
Given elevated HR, she ruled out for myocardial infarction with negative cardiac enzymes x3 and remained on telemetry.
Urince culture was positive for pan-sensitive Citrobacter for which she received 7-day course of Ciprofloxacin.
CXR was significant for moderate pleural effusion, but in the absence of cough, leukocytosis, or fever, it was felt that these effusions were not pathologic and would improve with auto-diuresis.
Blood cultures without growth at time of discharge, sputum cultures with 1+ GNRs which may or may not be contaminant.
Coagulopathy: Coagulation labs and platelets were checked 1 hour after administration of proplex and 2U FFP and vitamin K 10mg SQ.
Hematocrit and platelet count remained stable.
Coagulation labs returned to [**Location 213**] limits, prior to discharge.
Based on this her blood glucose remained well-controlled.
Medications on Admission: Diltiazem 240mg QD Toprol XL 50mg [**Hospital1 **] Simvastatin 20mg QD Lisinopril 5mg QD Metformin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] Warfarin 3mg QD   Discharge Medications: 1.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR 5.
She also had a UTI and atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate.
