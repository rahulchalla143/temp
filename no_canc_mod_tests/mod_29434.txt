At [**Hospital1 **], initial vitals were HR 98, 134/63, 95% on ?
A CXR revealed a LLL pneumonia and she was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
She had persistent hypoxia, with desaturation to the high 80s and initial ABG 7.21/61/74, prompting intubation.
Additionally, cardiac enzymes were elevated with a CK of 1900, MB of 25 with a normal MB index, and elevated troponin I to 0.43 (nl < 0.1).
An EKG showed lateral TWI in I and aVL, without ST segement changes.
CXR confirmed a LLL pneumonia, at which point vancomycin was added to her regimen.
Initial ABG was 7.17/66/242.
Labs otherwise notable for a leukocytosis at 22,000, hyperkalemia of 5.3, and hyperglycemia of 260.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
Physical Exam: 99.2, 158/62, 90, AC 500 x 16, FiO2 100%, Peep 5, Pip 31, Pplat 20.
NECK:  JVP 8-10 cm H20.

Port CXR [**10-13**] - 1) NG tube tip coiled with its tip in the proximal esophagus.
NCHCT [**10-13**] - There is no evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
EEG [**10-16**] - Markedly abnormal EEG due to the slow and disorganized background along with bursts of generalized slowing, some of which included spike or sharp and slow wave rhythmic patterns.
CXR (PA and lat) [**10-17**] - The heart size is normal.
A better technique chest x-ray demonstrates absence of any mass in the right middle lobe.
MRI [**10-17**] FINDINGS:  The posterior fossa structures are normal.
2) Drug abuse:  Given the history of narcotic and benzodiazepine abuse, a toxicology panel was ordered, and returned positive for methadone and other opiates.
Toxicology consulted and recommended Quest lab screen for clonazepam and benzo tox screen in house has 20% false negative rate for clonazepam.
EEG significant for diffuse slowing [**1-3**] toxic, metabolic encephalopathy, with occasional burst of slow and spiking wave activity concerning for seizures; however not sustained enough to rule in active seizure activity.
Per psych and SW evaluation and pt agreement, was transferred to dual diagnosis unit on a voluntary basis.
Troponin normal here.
CK elevation was thought to be non-specific and likely related to overlying process of drug overdose.
5) DM:  Her finger sticks were elevated on admission to the ICU, and she was placed briefly on an insulin drip.
We started a blood pressure medication called Lisinopril while you were in the hospital as your blood pressures were elevated.
