HEAD AND NECK CTA:  The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent.
MRI head [**2160-1-7**]: FINDINGS:  Again seen is acute hemorrhage in the left thalamus with surrounding vasogenic edema, resulting in minimal mass effect on the left lateral ventricle with bowing of the septum pellucidum.
No enhancing lesions are visualized, but a repeat study could be considered following resolution of the hematoma.
No enhancing lesions are visualized, but consider repeat study following resolution of hematoma.
CXR [**2160-1-6**]: FINDINGS:  No previous images.
NCHCT [**2160-1-9**]: FINDINGS:  There has been no interval change in the left thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
New since the prior study are air-fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally, worse on the left.
Given the left thalamic hemorrhage, the patient was admitted to the neurologic ICU for further monitoring and management.
Serial head CTs showed improvement in bleed.
His blood pressure was kept under 160 systolic and MAP < 130 using IV nipride and eventually IV hydralazine; his blood pressure was well controlled with oral agents once he came out to the floor.
His blood pressure goal can be lowered to < 140/90, which should be achieved with oral agents.
A video swallow study after about a week showed improvement, and he was cleared for pureed solids and nectar-thickened liquids.
