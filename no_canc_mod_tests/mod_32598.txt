He was transfered from [**Hospital6 28728**] Center for evaluation and management of his tracheomalacia on [**8-16**].
His troponin rose to 0.8 x2 as well at that time.
He required bipap and was able to be weaned off when his blood pressures normalized.

Multiple calcified mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes are present but not enlarged using CT criteria.
Although this study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
Suboptimal study with multiple respiratory movements.
Sub-3-mm lung nodules do not warrant further followup if there is no risk factor for neoplasia.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left heart pressures with a mean RA of 9mmHg and mean PCWP of 13mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.2 l/min/m2.
There was moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 36mmHg and a calculated valve area of 0.94cm2.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>70%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

Focal opacity overlying lower spine on lateral view appears to correspond to a large lateral osteophyte on recent CT of [**2109-8-19**].
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] (the cardiology service) for workup of flash pulmonary edema.
He does have a history of MRSA in his sputum from prior hospitalizations at an OSH, but MRSA screen was negative x2 here.
CXR was negative and has pending blood cultures to r/o yeast in the blood.
Based on the CT scan findings, his tracheobronchomalacia is likely mild and will not require stenting, but a bronchoscopy is warranted.
When your blood pressure is controlled, you are able to continue to breath well without problems.
You were transferred to the cardiology service where you had a catheterization to evaluate you aortic valve and your coronary arteries.
