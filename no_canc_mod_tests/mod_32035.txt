Initially, an EKG revealed atrial fibrillation with RVR in 170s so he was started on IV diltiazem.
His rate fell to 150s and rhythm switched to atrial flutter.
Reportedly, his blood pressure also fell with the diltiazem so he was switched to PO verapamil, IV digoxin, and amiodarone, but he remained in afib/aflutter and tachycardia.
Because his rate could not be successfully controlled, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cardioversion.
In terms of his dyspnea, he had a CXR at the OSH showing ?????
He also had an ABG that showed 7.17/100/81.
He diuresed well, his dyspnea markedly improved, and repeat ABG on [**6-6**] was 7.34/67/60 on 1.5L NC.
He was stable hemodynamically with HR in 80-110s and SBPs in 110s.

Atrial rate approximately 300, ventricular rate approximately 100-105.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Upon admission, EKG showed persistent atrial flutter with rates in the 150s.
He was given diltiazem IV bolus x2 over the first night which brought his rate down to the 110-120s.
He was also started on Coumadin 5 mg po qd and a heparin sliding scale to bridge to a goal INR 2.0-3.0.
Upon discharge, the patient was in normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 95 and BP of 121/69.
Scheduled for PCP followup on [**6-13**] to follow up on INR lab draw on [**6-12**], with goal INR [**2-20**].
