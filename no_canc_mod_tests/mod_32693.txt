ENT evaluated the patient for bleeding sources: Fiberoptic exam revealed no source of blood from the nose, nasopharynx, oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx or larynx; there were no supraglottic lesions.
CTA on [**8-5**] showed a Left superior segment coiled AVM with an adjacent ground glass opacity.
While a suboptimal study due to bowel gas, arterial flow and normal waveforms was noted is seen in the right and left distal most external iliac arteries and common femoral arteries bilaterally consistent with a prior femoral-femoral bypass.
A fresh blood clot was identified in the right lower lobe lateral segment which was therapeutically aspirated.
On [**8-6**], a repeat flexible bronchoscopy was performed to isolate a source of bleeding.There was a small clot on the right main stem, however, there were no clots or active bleeding in the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, right lower lobe.
Subclavian arteriogram demonstrating no abnormality of the left internal mammary artery.
The patient had several more episodes of hemoptysis on [**8-8**] - 2 tsp of bright red blood without clots - which resolved without intervention.
