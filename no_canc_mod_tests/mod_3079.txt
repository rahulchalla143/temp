She had an upright chest film that showed free air.
The patient was taken emergently into the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy after consent was obtained.
The proximal stomach was then aligned with a pursestring suture of 3-0 chromic.
A gastrotomy was made, and a gastrojejunostomy tube was passed through this opening with the tip in the proximal jejunum.
Specimens to pathology were anterior abdominal free-floating fatty mass.
CXR showed "new bilateral effusions present.
Repeat on [**8-6**] showed "Slight interval increase in atelectasis and overlying effusion at the left lung base."
EVALUATION: The examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in the bed.
If there are any further concerns for oral and pharyngeal dysphagia / aspiration, we would be happy to take the pt for a video swallow.

Her chest xray showed free air under the diaphragm.
A central line was placed, IV fluids and antibiotics were initiated, and she was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy.
On POD 2 her NGT was removed and she was transferred to the floor.
However, her WBC count was still elevated at 17.6 and we continued to await bowel function.
Pulmonary toilet and ambulation were encouraged.
Her blood cultures came back negative from the ER.
Cardiac enzymes and EKG were evaluated and were negative for ischemic event.
Later that day she was found with respiratory distress; respiratory rate in the 40s and oxygen saturation in the low 80s on NRB mask.
A post intubation chest xray showed small bilateral effusions, pulmonary edema, and no evidence of pneumothorax.
Repeat EKG and ECHO were performed.
The ECHO showed no acute changes from previous ECHO of [**2202-5-17**].
Her EKG showed mild demand ischemia and cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated from 0.03 to 0.09.
On POD 9 her respiratory culture was positive for pseudomonas and her antibiotic therapy was changed to Zosyn.
A swallow study was completed, and per recommendation she was advanced to thin liquids and soft solids.
On POD 11 her MRSA screen was negative.
On POD 12 she was afebrile and doing better.
A chest xray was performed to assess for interval change which showed bilateral moderate pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged from the prior radiograph.
She had several episodes of loose stool and this was sent for c. difficile which was negative.
