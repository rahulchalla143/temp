Will send urine for UA and cx, blood cx and stool cx (given marked leukocytosis and long term use of abx, should r/o Cdiff).
- fluid boluses and levophed for MAP > 60, SBP > 90 - blood to maintain hct > 30 - serial lactates - check UA, urine cx, blood cx, stool cx for Cdiff - cont zosyn, linezolid, flagyl for empiric antibiotic coverage - hold on [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim for now given that we would not give steroids given poor wound healing - no evidence of cardiac ischemia, EKG unchanged from prior, cardiac enzymes negative x 2 sets .
- f/u UA, urine cx, blood cx, stool cx for Cdiff - continue antibiotics .

Cr is 1.1, from baseline of 0.7-0.8 with decrease urine output.
If component of ATN may not be able to assess volume status via urine output so will bolus for blood pressure.
- recheck lactate regularly -> goal MAP >60, SBP >90 - may need urine electrolytes to further evaluate .
- currently holding PO lopressor given pressor dependence - restart ASA - monitor on telemetry .
Unable to obtain brain imaging secondary to body habitus.
