On routine vitals earlier today she was found to have a RA sat in the mid-80s.
On repeat check, her sat was 94%, but then dropped to the mid-80s again.
On their arrival, once again her sat was in the mid 80s with a good tracing.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 97.2, BP 117/74, HR 101, R 32, O2 sat 89% on supplemental O2 (unclear how much).
Exam was only notable for intermittent agitation, no respiratory distress, lungs clear, mild LE swelling.
ABG was 7.37/70/48 on RA with lactate 0.8.
CXR was clear.
CTA chest negative for PE.
Repeat ABG on NRB was 7.31/75/126.

# Hypoxia: Patient presented with significant hypoxia with oxygen saturations occasionally falling into the 60s on room air.
Echo with bubble study was performed that ruled out any septal defects or cardiac malformations that could be causing a shunt.
CTA showed no evidence of PE.
EKG was without ischemic changes, cardiac enzymes were negative and telemetry was without events.
Echo and chest x-ray showed no evidence of pulmonary effusion or CHF.
She had no fever or leukocytosis during admission but infiltrate on CT chest suggested infectious etiology so patient was treated with a 5 day course of levaquin.
During her admission patient's saturations improved.
At time of discharge she was maintaining saturations greater than 90% on room air while awake.
At night, however, patient's oxygen saturations would fall to 80-85%.
Would strongly consider outpatient sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea.
