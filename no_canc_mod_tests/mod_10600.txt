Blood pressure was 108/palp.
The patient's chest x-ray showed right upper lobe opacity with diffuse patchy opacities bilaterally and no pleural effusion.
The patient's head CT was negative.
Electrocardiogram showed no ST changes and normal sinus rhythm.
On admission the patient's arterial blood gas was 7.14, pCO2 of 67, pO2 94; CBC with a white count of 25.9, hematocrit 47.2, platelet count 343; CHEM7 was with a sodium of 146, potassium 4.8, chloride 110, BUN 23, creatinine 2.1, glucose 109, lactate 5.6, amylase 160; PT 15.5, PTT 27.2, INR 1.7.
?, heart rate 99, blood pressure 88/37, 100% oxygen saturation, and the patient was intubated.
HEENT exam showed pupils were pinprick and sluggishly reactive.
Chest exam showed diffuse wheezing bilaterally.
Subsequent electrocardiogram showed peak T-waves and ST segment elevation in II, III, and AVF which persisted over multiple electrocardiograms.
Bedside echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis.
The patient's subsequent troponin levels and CKMBs came back positive.
The results of cardiac catheterization showed an ejection fraction of 20-25%, otherwise unremarkable.
The patient has a PA pressure of 33/20, wedge of 15, SVR of 639, PVR of 91, with anteroapical inferior global hypokinesis.
Subsequent chest x-ray was consistent with aspiration versus early ARDS versus narcotic induced pulmonary edema.
He was taken to the Catheterization Lab which was negative for any blockage in the patient's coronaries.
The patient's enzymes were subsequently cycled.
The patient's BUN and creatinine resolved with fluid resuscitation.
Over the next several days, the patient experienced multiple episodes of agitation, bucking the vent, with respiratory rates increasing to the 50s requiring increased boluses of Propofol.
The patient was given a CT of the chest which showed multiple diffuse bilateral opacities.
On [**2114-9-23**], the patient subsequently dropped oxygen saturations secondary to mucous plugging and required several therapeutic bronchoscopies.
The patient again dropped oxygen saturations to the low 50s and was subsequently "bagged up" requiring immediate bronchoscopy.
Subsequent bronchoscopy showed complete obstruction of bronchus intermedius of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe bronchi with diffuse mucous plugging, complete obstruction of left upper lobe with bronchus plugs, all of which were removed with suction.
The patient was given a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction between 35 and 40%.
Repeat electrocardiogram showed resolving ST segment elevations in II, III, and AVF, and cardiac enzymes were negative.
The patient was also given subsequent chest CT which showed small pericardial effusion, leftward shift in the mediastinum, grain-glass opacities, improved from previous chest CT.
The remaining grain-glass opacities found in the left upper lobe and posterior right lower lobe also demonstrated collapse of the left lower lobe, new from chest x-ray of [**9-24**].
The patient's subsequent sputum culture grew out Streptococcus pneumoniae sensitive to Levofloxacin, which the patient was on and continued on.
The patient received an additional bronchoscopy which showed secretions without any mucous plugging.
The patient was ordered to have respiratory mechanic study secondary to the patient's difficulty to wean and multiple repeated episodes of desaturation both in the setting of mucous plugging with diagnostic therapeutic bronchoscopy and with negative bronchoscopy.
The patient was found to have a peak transpulmonary pressure of 20-25 and expiratory pressures from 0-5, implying that the patient's lungs were not overdistended and PEEP was adequate.
On around [**2114-9-26**], and [**2114-9-27**], the patient became hypoxic with systolic pressures in the 70s requiring the start of Dopamine and multiple fluid boluses which were slowly weaned.
The patient was switched to pressure support ventilation with driving pressures of 26, respiratory rate of 18, PEEP of 13, FI02 of 80%, with good tidal volumes anywhere from 600-700.
