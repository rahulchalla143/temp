Dobutamine MIBI at that time revealed a partially reversible inferior defect without any EKG changes or symptoms during the exam.
Shortly thereafter he was found to be in sinus bradycardia with a rate in the 30s with stable blood pressure and worsening O2 saturation to the 70s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission he was afebrile at 97.3 F.  Blood pressure was 116/65, heart rate 78, respiratory rate 22 and he was saturating at 94% on six liters by nasal cannula.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, his right eye was obviously status post traumatic injury.
Heart exam had a distant S1, S2 with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Revealed a white blood cell count of 7.9, hematocrit 53.9, platelets of 147.
Chem-7 was remarkable only for a potassium of 3.6.
BUN and creatinine of 11 and 1.1.
First set of CKs drawn in the Emergency Department was 68.
Chest x-ray revealed low lung volumes, mild interstitial edema, bilateral lower lobe opacities resembling atelectasis versus consolidation.
EKG was sinus at 80 beats per minute with a first degree AV block, right axis deviation, Q waves in V1 through V3 and RV strain pattern likely secondary to his chronic lung disease.
Echocardiogram from [**2177-6-11**] revealed LV wall thickness, cavity size and systolic function were normal with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
His blood pressure was controlled with an IV Nitroglycerin drip and he was started on low dose Captopril.
Cath revealed elevated right sided pressures with a pulmonary artery pressure of 61/34 and a mean of 46.
Wedge pressure was 22.
Cardiac output and index were 6.2 and 2.9 respectively.
SVR was 1148.
His LV ejection fraction was 64%.
Coronary angiography revealed a patent RCA stent, 50% OM2 lesion and 40% proximal LAD lesion.
Prior to discharge the patient walked in the [**Doctor Last Name **] with Physical Therapy and found that his heart rate elevated to 140.
Upon arrival to the CCU, his initial O2 sat was 78% which came up to the mid to high 80s on five to six liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
Blood gas at the time revealed a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 35 and pO2 of 41%.
Blood gas was repeated revealing similar numbers and in looking back at his blood gasses from previous admissions, this is his baseline pO2.
After mild diuresis and Albuterol, Atrovent nebulizers, his O2 saturation increased to 91% on five liters which is his baseline.
After his cath, CBC was checked and his blood level was stable.
