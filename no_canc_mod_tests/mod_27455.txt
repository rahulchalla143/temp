[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is systolic reversal as noted by pulse wave doppler of both sided pulmonary veins.
He underwent preoperative workup and plavix washout.
