Per pt, his cardiologist did an EKG at the time and told him it was likely MSK.
HR 50, SBP 50.
He presented to OSH with CP and bradycardia to 49 as well as borderline low BP 103/54, RR 20.
EKG with mild ST elevations in II,III,AVF, mild ST depressions in I, AVL.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], Pt was afebrile, HR 44, BP 105/69, RR15, 97%RA.
CK 108, Trop 0.06.
Brother has DM, but no hx of MI   Physical Exam: VS: T97.3 , BP 144/51 , HR 55 , RR 16, O2 % on Gen: middle aged male, obese.
MM dry Neck: Supple with JVP at angle of jaw CV: RR, normal S1, S2.
Compared with EKG from ealrier, the changes are now less pronounced .
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION COMMENTS:     1.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed one vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left filling  pressures with RVEDP of 15 mmHg and mean PCW of 25 mmHg.
There was normal systemic arterial pressure with SBP of 126 mmHg and DBP of 71 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.5 L/min/m2.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
His EKG and clinical presentation were consistent with a right-sided myocardial infarction, as he had mild ST elevations in II, III, and AVF with an ectopic atrial rhythm; bradycardia, and hypotension.
A post-cath echocardiogram was obtained which showed segmental wall motion abnormalities in distribution of his MI, with preserved overall LV function (EF >55%).
His EKG returned to a normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in the distribution of his MI.
We performed a cardiac catheterization, which is a procedure where we use a stent to improve blood flow in your blocked coronary artery.
You will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the cardiologist that did your cardiac catheterization on [**2171-3-4**].
