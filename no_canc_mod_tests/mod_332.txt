Blood Cx: [**1-13**], [**1-13**], [**1-16**], [**1-17**]: no growth Urine: [**1-13**], [**1-13**], [**1-15**]: no growth  Images: CXR: CONCLUSION: Overall, findings are suggestive of mild CHF with superimposed infection at the left lung base.
Doppler evaluation limited due to patient body habitus.
The abnormal appearance of the right renal waveform could be due to suboptimal study quality, presence of stenosis not excluded.
His symptoms had improved, but labwork showed Cr of 20 and BUN of 120.
He was brought in for repeat labs which confirmed initial findings and then referred to ED for evaluation.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.8 P83 BP 161/102 R 18 O2 sat 93% RA.
SBP of 220/125 at maximum during ED stay.
A CXR showed LLL infiltrate with mild to moderate congestion.
The patient was started on a nitro gtt for BP control with SBP 160-180's.
The patient's urine sediment was bland.
His renal U/S showed a right kidney of 11.1 cm and the left kidney of 10 cm.
The patient underwent CT-guided biopsy on [**1-17**].
The final pathology is still pending, but preliminary review showed extensive scar and immune complex deposition.
His PPD was negative and HepB serologies conisistent with previous infection.
He was started on a nitro gtt in the ED with SBP 160-180's and was continued in the MICU.
The patient's blood pressure regimen was amlodipine 10mg daily, labetolol 200mg TID and clonidine 0.1mg TID.
His blood pressures decreased with the regimen and after dialysis.
His labetolol was also changed to [**Hospital1 **] dosing after his blood pressure ranged 100-120's.
His VL was 1.19million.
# Q-Waves on EKG: His ECG finding were consistent with prior MI.
His CK were not elevated enough to be the primary etiology for renal failure.
His CK trended down thoughout his admission.
