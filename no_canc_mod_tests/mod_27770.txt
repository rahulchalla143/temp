PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 7.4, hematocrit 40.7, platelet count 237,000, PT 13.3, PTT 27.2, INR 1.2.
Repeat platelet count 199,000.
Urinalysis showed trace amount of blood but was otherwise negative.
Sodium 141, K 4.4, chloride 102, bicarb 29, BUN 22, creatinine 1.2, blood sugar of 121.

Triglycerides 150, HDL 35, cholesterol to HD ratio 3.9.
Preoperative chest x-ray showed slightly enlarged heart but in top normal heart size and no acute  cardiopulmonary pathology.
Preoperative EKG showed sinus rhythm at 60 with left atrial enlargement and prior inferior and lateral myocardial infarction.
On postoperative day, he remained extubated with a postoperative ejection fraction of 25 to 30% and remained on Levophed drip at 0.04, lidocaine at 2.0 and Norcuron at 0.375.
He was in sinus rhythm at 87, with blood pressure of 109/59.
POSTOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 14.7, hematocrit 31.3, K 4.5,  BUN 14, creatinine 0.7, INR 1.5.
His Norcuron was down to 0.25 which was weaned off during the day.
He continued to improve hemodynamically with a blood pressure of 98/54, in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 89.
Creatinine remained stable at 0.9.
His leg incision was clean, dry and intact with no peripheral swelling.
His blood pressure was 131/86, in sinus rhythm at 79.
He was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the office in 4 weeks for postoperative surgical visit, to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23430**], his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 to 2 weeks post discharge and to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist, in 2 to 3 weeks post discharge.
