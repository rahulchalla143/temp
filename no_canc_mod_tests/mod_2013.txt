NCHCT ([**2197-11-3**]):  No acute intracranial process with marked sinus opacification, perhaps related to intubation.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 74 98 86 382/406 75 33 59    Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented as an OSH transfer in apparent status epilepticus.
However, even after propofol was weaned off her exam was limited and she did not follow commands or open her eyes to stimulation.
She was continued on phenytoin IV 100mg Q8H, and her EEG did not show any seizure activity.
Her MRI that did not show any acute process.
She had an LP done which was unremarkable.
Her EEGs continued to show no seizure activity but she remained very somnolent.
Prior to discharge, her neurological examination was reportedly at baseline per her family.
As a part of a routine work up for a possible stroke, we checked a lipid panel which showed an extremely elevated triglyceride level.
Her oxygenation remained in the mid-90's on NC once extubated, and remained stable from a respiratory standpoint following extubation and tolerated being without a nasal cannula.
Her BAL and sputum Cx grew out MRSA and she was continued on vancomycin and other ABx were D/C'd.
# HEMATOLOGY: HCT dropped on arrival from 28->23, of unclear cause.
Her HCT continued to drop to 21, and she ws given 1u pRBC with improvement.
However, it was felt that her HCT drop was likely dilutional because she was 6L positive for her LOS and when given some lasix her HCT improved.
- Please monitor levels of vancomycin especially if other medications will be changed - Have patient follow up with PCP and neurologist - Please check a repeat lipid panel in [**1-22**] weeks - Obtain a repeat CXR following resolution of vancomycin therapy to check for clearance of VAP  Medications on Admission: Alendronate ASA 81 Sertraline 12.5 daily omeprazole folate, Vit D, Calcium albuterol prn   Discharge Medications: 1. levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).

We obtained an MRI of your brain, as well as obtained a lumbar puncture which allowed us to rule out very serious causes of new seizures such as bleeding, stroke, infections, or other such causes.
