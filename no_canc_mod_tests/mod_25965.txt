Fluid overload, is less likely given interval resolution of pleural effusions.
Recommend further evaluation with an ultrasound to further assess for any intraluminal membranes or other evidence of gangrenous cholecystitis.
Improved abdominal and pelvic ascites   Brief Hospital Course: ICU:  [**2173-7-26**] trigerred [**7-26**] @ 17:50 for RR 27 [**2173-7-24**] cont lasix gtt, added acetazolamide [**2173-7-23**] off dilt, BP improved, a-line d/c'd, duplex - patent hepatic arteries [**2173-7-22**] episodes of SBP 200s, responds to dilt, TTE: WNL, CTA - coils working [**2173-7-21**] off labetolol gtt, HCT 24->27 s/p 1u pRBC, +1add'l pRBC, rheum c/s, west 1 c/s ICU COURSE: [**7-20**]: She was admitted to the ICU and sent urgently to IR for coil embolization: 3 aneurysms seen on arteriogram, 2 visible during IR.
[**7-21**]: Showing signs of stability, further work-up was performed for question of auto-immune vasculitis.
A renal U/S done was normal.
She showed signs of fluid overload this day, desaturating to the low 80's with a CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.
She responded well to diuresis with lasix but required 2 more units PRBC to keep her hct above 28.
Her liver enzymes peaked, as expected, this day.
ECHO showed normal ventricular function while CTA chest showed no PE but continued volume overload.
CT of the liver showed resolution of the aneurysms, functioning coils and patent hepatic vein with the expected hypoperfused left liver segments.
[**7-23**]: Liver duplex showed sucessful embolization of L hepatic artery and patent R hepatic arterial system.
Liver enzymes continued to return towards normalcy.
Her bilirubin peaked at 2.2 on post-procedure day 4 and then also began to normalize.
She continued to spike fevers nightly while all cultures and work-up remained negative.
We were aware of her issue with chronic UTI, but urine studies were not consistent with this being the source.
At the time of transfer to the floor, she was tolerating regular diet, fevers had resolved, her hematocrit was stable, ambulating independently.
Her bilirubin continued to remain elevated while her LFTs trended downwards and there was concern for gallbladder pathology.
a RUQ U/S performed on [**7-28**] showed a heterogenous gallbladder that was concerning for necrosis.
She was evaluated for a perc chole on [**7-29**] but repeat U/S did not show necrosis.

You had a work-up done at an outside hospital which showed bloody fluid in your abdomen and hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms and you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
There was concern for your gallbladder being infected, since your liver function studies were elevated, but an ultrasound performed did not show evidence of that.
Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with the acute care service in 1 month with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 853**] with a CT A/P w/ IV contrast in the arterial phase performed before your appointment.
You can schedule this appointment and the imaging study by calling the [**Hospital 2536**] clinic: #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 600**].
