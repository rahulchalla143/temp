Pain was sharp, tearing [**11-9**].
CT abdomen at [**Hospital3 **] demonstrates concern for an aortic dissection.
A repeat CT torso was performed here.
The mesenteric vessels (celiac, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and renal arteries) are not involved.

dopplerable DP bilaterally and palpable PT bilaterally  NEURO EXAM:  MS - pt repeats any phrases asked to him, and then will mumble incomprehensibly when asked orientation questions.
REFLEXES - pt has intact and symmetrical reflexes in UE's.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2146-4-1**]):  NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..  FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2146-4-4**]):    NO GROWTH.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO VIRUS ISOLATED.
Active contrast extravasation into the intramural hematoma at the aortic arch (2:40), now currently measures 25 x 17 mm, increased since the previous examination (11 x 8mm previously).
The celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and bilateral renal arteries (note is made of two right renal arteries) are all patent.
The iliac arteries, common, internal, and external are normal in caliber.
An exophytic cyst arising off the upper pole of the right kidney is unchanged.
A spinal MRI may be helpful to further evaluate for spinal cord abnormalities including dedicated MR angiography of spinal vessels if clinically indicated.
CT SCAN HEAD:  FINDINGS: This study is markedly limited secondary to patient motion.
Son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign was negative.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Went to the CVICU with strict blood pressure control.
Lumbar drain was placed with goal ICP less then 15.
His examination was overall very limited.
However, CN:II-XII seemed to be gossly intact.
He barely moved his toes in response to painful stimulation of the left leg.
DTRs were 1+ in the arms & difficult to elicit in the legs.
Sensory examination could not be performed due to agitation & non-cooperation.
His Lumbar drain was removed.
CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
We changed the parameters with a new MAP greater then 100.
Once his BP was stabalized he was transitioned to PO medications.
Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
GI: Initially pt was made NPO/NGT for gastric distention on CT scan.
HD #7 foley was removed.
