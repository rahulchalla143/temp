In the Emergency Department the patient was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 108/56, pulse 91, hematocrit 28, and INR of 2.3.
His baseline hematocrit is around 33 and then three hours later his hematocrit dropped to 25.
An EGD was performed as the most worrisome cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in his case would be recurrent gastric variceal bleeding.
He had a right upper quadrant to evaluate TIPS which showed stenosis and, thus, he underwent revision of his TIPS on [**2167-1-7**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR:  Vital signs:  Temperature is 100.8, heart rate ranges from 81 to 100, blood pressure 104 to 131/31 to 62, breathing 20, satting 95% on room air.
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis pulse is 2+ bilaterally.
Sensation to light touch intact bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  This patient's hematocrit Nadired at 25 and was 35 upon discharge.
White blood cells were within normal limits.
INR was 2.3 upon admission and went down with administration of fresh frozen plasma and one dose of vitamin K but then went back up on the day of discharge.
Chem-7 within normal limits and calcium 7.5 but corrected for the low albumin.
Phosphorous 3.3, magnesium 1.6.
LFTs:  ALT 82, AST 143, alkaline phosphatase 187, amylase 75, total bilirubin 9.4, albumin 2.0.
On [**2167-1-5**] right upper quadrant ultrasound showed ascites with left portal vein thrombosis, TIPS stenosis, and hepatopetal flow in the portal vein.
EKG on [**2167-1-5**] showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T wave changes or Qs.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed narrowing of the TIPS, and thus patient underwent TIPS revision, as described above.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**2167-1-8**] showed wall-to-wall flow in the TIPS.
Hematocrits were checked two times a day and were stable as of midnight the night prior to discharge through discharge.
He was transfused for hematocrit less than 27.
Hematocrit upon discharge was 35, although this may reflect some hematoconcentration secondary to beginning diuretics on the day of discharge.
Coagulopathy:  INR of 2.3.
His goal INR was 1.1 to 1.2 while bleeding.
Ascites:  Spironolactone was held until his hematocrit was stable.
The patient did spike a temperature to 101.7 at midnight on [**2167-1-8**].
Blood and urine cultures were sent, and a chest x-ray was done, and a paracentesis was performed on [**2167-1-8**] by ultrasound which showed 100 red blood cells.
Cultures at the time of discharge include no growth seen on fluid culture of the peritoneal fluid.
Blood cultures were pending at the time of discharge.
Urine culture showed mixed bacterial flora consistent with scant anterogenital contamination.
His electrolytes were followed closely.
He was seen by Nutrition, which recommended no supplements as of right now as his weight has been unchanged over the past two months.
Good hemostasis was obtained, and the TIPS was sent for culture, which is pending at the time of discharge.
Hepatitis C. 4.
He should have labs drawn on Monday, [**2167-1-12**], a CBC, INR, LFTs, Chem-7, and fax those to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 697**].
Sucralfate 1 gram four times a day.
Insulin regimen:  He checks his fingersticks four times a day, and based on his fingersticks and the rise of his fingersticks, he will contact his [**Name (NI) **] physician for changes in his regimen.
