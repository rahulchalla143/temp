IR was consulted and a bleeding scan was done which was nondiagnostic.
At the time of transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] at [**Hospital1 18**], his VS were stable on 1.5 mcg/kg of neo.
He was noted to still be sleepy from sedation for his scope (done at 4pm on day of transfer).
He was intubated for respiratory distress, and received 6 U PRBC, 4 U plts, and 4 U FFP during the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
He underwent a CTA, which showed active bleeding in a loop of mid-to-distal ileum situated within the right hemipelvis.
On [**3-1**], patietn had tagged red cell scan done which was negative as well.
He has been transfused a total of 11 units pRBCs since admission to [**Hospital1 18**].. HCT increased from 32-> 39, and has remained stable.
Surgery has requested to maintain hct >30, plts >100, fibrinogen >100 (ICU has been doing plts >50).

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2-27**]: 1.
Mesenteric angiogram [**2-27**]: 1.
Right femoral arteriogram demonstrated access of the right common femoral artery.
A nuclear RBC scan is recommended to see if there is persistent bleeding.
CTA abdomen/pelvis [**2-28**] (wet read): No active bleed at this time.
Bilateral moderate simple pleural effusions with basal atelectasis, slightly larger since prior study of [**2-27**].
A taggedRBC study may be helpful to localize the bleed.
Tagged RBC study [**3-1**]: Normal study with no evidence of GI bleeding during the time of study.
Chest x-ray [**3-2**]: Moderately severe pulmonary edema is new, accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusion, but heart size and mediastinal vascular caliber are normal.
TTE [**2190-3-4**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

He had a capsule study which was normal and did not show any bleeding.
# HIV: CD4 count 51 this admission, on HAART.
Sputum PCP x1 was negative.
Also had some pulmonary edema on chest x-ray and was diuresed with Lasix.
On admission, patient was afebrile, but did have a WBC count, highly neutrophilic without bandemia, more suggestive of WBC count from steroids than infection.
Disp:*450 ML(s)* Refills:*2* 7. atovaquone 750 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily).
You had an imaging study which showed the location of your bleed.
Plans were made for a repeat attempt, but repeat imaging no longer showed the location of the bleed.
You also had a capsule study in which you swallowed a camera.
By discharge, you were no longer having bloody bowel movements and your blood counts were stable.
During the admission, you had a chest x-ray which showed that your lungs were quite inflated suggestive of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) which is caused by an extensive smoking history.
We discussed two alternative medications, Atovaquone which could be expensive and inhaled Pentamidine monthly.
