He had diagnostic catheterization and was sent to [**Hospital1 346**] for therapeutic catheterization.
Catheterization on [**2106-3-12**] showed reportedly an 80% left circumflex stenosis and a questionable stenosis of the LAD.
Today's cath showed a right dominate system, 100% LAD lesion, 90% left circumflex, 100% RCA.
The patient was noted to have an episode of chest pain with shortness of breath during the catheterization associated with brief, no reflow after dilation of the saphenous vein graft to LAD with decreased blood pressures to systolic to 70s to 80s.
The patient was not noted to have EKG changes  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient has stable, two pillow orthopnea.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature 97.4 F, heart rate 84, blood pressure 127/62, respiratory rate 15, O2 saturation 98% on room air.
HEENT exam normocephalic, atraumatic.
JVP of approximately 6 cm.
Respirations - clear to auscultation bilaterally anterior, unable to sit up secondary to sheath.
LABORATORY DATA FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  Hemoglobin 13.8, hematocrit 40, BUN 24, creatinine 1.1, potassium 3.6, INR ....................
IMPRESSION:  A 67 year-old male with CAD status post catheterization for work up of unstable angina complicated by no reflow after dilatation of stent to LAD leading to hypotension and chest pain.
Post catheterization check to the groin revealed no hematoma or bruit.
Cardiac enzymes were monitored post catheterization with anticipation with a likely bump secondary to the no reflow phenomenon.
However no such spike in cardiac enzymes were noted.
HEMATOLOGY - The patient's hematocrit was noted to be stable with no need for transfusion.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION - The patient was noted to tolerated po well and was only supplemented with IV fluids post catheterization.
Electrolytes were monitored closely and repleted as necessary.
RENAL - The patient's BUN and creatinine remained stable post catheterization with no signs of dye induced nephropathy.
The patient's blood sugars were monitored [**Hospital1 **] with a regular sliding scale insulin for coverage however the patient was not in need of such coverage.
