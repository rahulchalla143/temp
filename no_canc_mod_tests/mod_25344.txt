Admission Date:  [**2135-7-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-7-13**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Fosamax  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Inferior wall MI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Esophagogastroduodenoscopy   History of Present Illness: 82 year old male with history of DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, [**Hospital 67277**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of acute inferior wall MI.
He presented to his primary care physician in the AM, and was directed to go to the ER after an EKG reportedly with atiral flutter.
On arrival to OSH ED, his vitals were P 116, BP 118/76, R 16.
An EKG at that time reportedly showed rapid AF.
He was given SL nitro for his chest pain with decrease in BP to 83/59.
Given the persistence of his chest pain he underwent CTA which was negative for dissection.
1st set of cardiac enzymes were negative.
BNP was 71.
A repeat EKG later in the afternoon demonstrated prominent ST elevation in the inferior leads.
His right and left sided filling pressures were both noted to be elevated, with a PCWP of 37, and PA 47/29.
His BP was consistently > 100 systolic throughout, with HR intermittently 110-120.
Past Medical History: 1) AAA status post repair about 15 years ago 2) DM2 3) Hypertriglyceridemia 4) Hypertension 5) Basal cell carcinoma of the ear 6) Squamous cell carcinoma, sublingual 7) BPH 8) COPD  Social History: Smokes Heavy smoker for 60 years.

2.Resting hemodyanmics revealed elavted right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 25mmHg and pulmonary cappilary wedge pressure of 37mmHg.
The Cardiac index was reduced at 1.5 L/min/m2.
Final angiography showed TIMI III flow, no dissection, no embolizationa and no peforation.
Asceding aortography revealed no evidenc of dissection.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram, [**2135-7-9**]: MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: *<= 25% (nl >=55%)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  This study was compared to the prior study of [**2135-7-8**].
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-7-8**], the LV is better visualized, and LV function is clearly reduced on this study.
EKG [**2135-7-7**] Irregular supraventricular tachycardia, possibly multifocal atrial tachycardia.
Transesophageal Echocardiogram [**2135-7-11**]: GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
EGD [**2135-7-11**] Findings: Esophagus:  Mucosa: Localized mild erythema of the mucosa was noted in the gastroesophageal junction.
[**2135-7-7**] 09:06PM   calTIBC-386 FERRITIN-56 TRF-297 [**2135-7-7**] 09:06PM   TSH-0.052* [**7-8**] Free T4-1.1  Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old male with history of DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, [**Hospital 67277**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of acute inferior wall MI.
2) Low cardiac index: The patient's low CI during cardiac cath could not be completely explained by his inferior MI, and a possible secondary component of cardiomyopathy was evaluated.
Iron studies and free T4 levels were normal.
Given the patient's atrial tachycardia on EKG and report of previous episodes of palpitations, tachycardia-induced-cardiomyopathy was the primary consideration.
Echo was performed which demonstrated severe LV global hypokinesis.
Follow-up echo in six weeks and further workup as an outpatient.
3) Tachycardia: Patient presented with heart rate in 100-120s.
EKG consistent with atrial tachycardia vs atrial flutter.
The patient had a therapeutic INR at discharge after several days of 5mg coumadin and was sent home on 3 mg coumadin with a plan for INR check in 2 days post discharge.
4) GI bleed: OSH reports hematocrit of 37, and following catheterization patient's hematocrit was 29.
GI was informed, and because of the plan to send the patient home on long-term coumadin for atrial arrhythmia, a GI workup was initiated.
The patient had an EGD which demonstrated gastritis and mild esophagitis but no obvious bleeding source.
H. pylori testing was also performed.
Because no gastroduodenal ulcer was found and patient's hematocrit remained stable prior to discharge, he was deemed safe for discharge on warfarin.
5) DM: Patient's blood sugar was well controlled with sliding scale insulin.
Medications on Admission: Humalog 75/25 36 units in AM, 25 QPM Metformin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] Pioglitazone 45 mg [**Hospital1 **] Omeprazole 40 mg PO DAILY Gemfibrozil 600 mg PO BID Atorvastatin 10 mg PO DAILY Lasix 20 mg PO DAILY Ecotrin 325 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Home Health Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses 1) Inferior Myocardial Infarction 2) Supraventricular Tachycardia 3) Gastritis 4) Benign prostatic hypertrophy  Secondary diagnosis 1) COPD 2) Diabetes type II 3) hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Stable Ambulating without assistance Tolerating normal diet   Discharge Instructions: When you came to the hospital, you had a blockage of one of your coronary arteries.
Because of the potential for you to return to a fast heart rate, you are at risk for forming a blood clot in your heart, which can be a cause of stroke.
You should have your INR checked on Friday, [**7-15**] and again on Monday, [**7-18**].
If your INR level is too high, your physician will adjust your coumadin dose.
[**Last Name (STitle) 29478**], about this, and you will need further evaluation for this problem.
A colonoscopy may be required.
You should have an echocardiogram in [**12-6**] months to check your heart function.
Followup Instructions: You have an appointment to have your blood drawn to check your INR on Friday of this week.
PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) 29557**] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
