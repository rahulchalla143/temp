Discharge Labs: Hct 25.9, WBC 6.1, Plt 198, Cr 6.7, K 3.4, Na 137, Vanco trough 22.3 .
Chest CT ([**1-22**]) New 2.5 x 2 cm fluid collection with air-fluid level consistent with an abscess along the course of a resected segment of the right dysfunctionalized loop catheter.
Left Arm AV Fistulogram ([**1-25**]) Left AV fistulogram and ultrasound Doppler showed completely thrombosed AV fistula.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head: FINDINGS: Image quality is slightly degraded due to patient motion.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-2-7**], no major change is evident.
Micro: C. diff negative x3.
Wound swab positive for MRSA, sensitive to Vanco f/u blood cultures NGTD    Brief Hospital Course: 63 y.o.
An order was placed to assess the left chest AV fistula, but due to a misunderstanding, a left arm AV fistulogram was performed by IR which showed a completely clotted graft.
An AV fistulogram of the left chest was not performed until [**2-2**] and both this fistulogram and a possible thrombectomy were complicated by nausea/vomiting under local anesthesia.
Additional imaging at this time showed a left IJ that was small in caliber and occluded, preventing placement of a line in this location.
ABG demonstrated findings consistent with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
had a chest wall abscess, positive for MRSA on a previous hospitalization for which he was treated with Vancomycin for 14 days.
However, in the MICU, blood cultures grew Serratia marcens.
Because follow up cultures were negative, they recommended stopping his gentamicin.
CT head was negative.
