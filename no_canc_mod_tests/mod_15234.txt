Cardiac cath/TTE showed severe aortic stenosis (valve area of 0.9cm2 and valve gradient of 38).
His cardiac output was also preserved, at 5.4L/min.
At OSH lab studies were notable for acardiac enzyme peak CK of 115 and MB of 10.7, with a peak troponin of 4.33.
Microbiology was notable for a urine culture which grew 2 types of pseudomonas, subswuqently changed foley.
In OSH ED he recieved adenosine 18 mg total which failed to break his tachypnea, and he was also noted to be tachycardic into the 150s; he also recieved IV lopressor and was transferred to ICU where he was placed on BIPAP and given dilt 10 mg IV which [**Last Name (un) 4662**] HR down to 120s.
EF 20-25% -inferior NSTEMI [**2126**] -Severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.9) -CABG: N/A -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: N/A .
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 2L home O2 -Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus -Questionable history of syncope -History of pulmonary embolus in [**2120**] -GERD -left femoral aneurysm repaired [**7-/2133**] [**Hospital1 2025**] -AAA, infrarenal evaluated at 4.5cm on [**2133-7-16**] CT -recurrent pneumonia -lung nodules, stable -large pneumothorax requiring chest tube post-bronch [**2133**]  Social History: The patient is divorced.
Physical Exam: VS: T 96.3 BP 140/80 HR= 114 RR= 32 O2 sat= 94% on BIPAP.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 14 cm.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: CXR [**2134-1-11**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-16**]: Extensive opacification in right lower lung probably due to pulmonary edema in the setting of chronic emphysema.
CXR [**2134-1-12**] ET tube in standard placement.
CXR [**2134-1-13**] 1.
CXR [**2134-1-14**] IMPRESSION: Stable left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
CXR [**2134-1-15**] Lines and tubes are stable.
CXR [**2133-1-16**] Tracheal and nasogastric tube have been removed.
Repeat CXR consistent with right-sided pleural effusion and increase in pulmonary vascular markings consistent with likely flash pulmonary edema.
On HD 5, EKG revealed Atrial fibrillation with RVR that was unresponsive to IV metoprolol.
He was loaded on a diltiazem drip and heparin gtt with heart rates persistently in the 130s and SBPs in the 120-130s.
