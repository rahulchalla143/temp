JVD appreciated 3cm below ear lobe.
Pertinent Results: Right cardiac cath ([**2194-12-4**]):  Patient noted to have wedge of 36, RA 15, PA 55, RVED 22, CI 3.25. .
EKG([**2194-12-3**]):  Sinus rhythm of 85.
EF ([**2194-12-3**]):  EF 35%.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
[Intrinsic left  ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue synchronization imaging demonstrates no significant left ventricular dyssynchrony.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated mean PCPW of 15mmHg.
Cardiac index was normal at 3.8 l/min/m2.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 66 year old woman with CAD, status post MI in [**2186**] and [**2191**], moderate MR, EF 35%, and CHF who was hospitalized in [**Month (only) **] [**2193**] for CHF exacerbation, who presented for a scheduled appointment today and was noted to have increased shortness of breath over the past two weeks.
#) CHF: The patient was noted to have an EF of 35% on [**2194-12-3**], in setting of moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] has had increasing shortness of breath in the past several weeks.
Right heart cath on [**2194-12-4**] revealted a wedge pressure of 36, RA 15, PA 55, and a CI 3.25.
A repeat right heart cath on [**2194-12-9**] revealed much improved hemodynamics with a wedge pressure of 15 with a CI of 3.8.
An ECHO on [**2194-12-9**] showed 3+MR and mild AS with an LVEF of 30-40%.
She had preop labs drawn and carotid U/S which showed bilateral less than 40% stenosis.

Her creatinine peaked at 4.9 but she still continued to make urine.
A renal u/s was performed which showed no hydronephrosis.
Vein mapping was performed and the patient was informed about fistula placement.
