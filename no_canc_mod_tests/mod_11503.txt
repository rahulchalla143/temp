CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2179-5-17**] 1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with patent and mildly diseased LMCA.
Graft angiography showed patent SVG to RCA and patent SVG to OM2.
Hemodynamic assessment showed normal left sided filling pressures and preserved cardiac index.
Pre-cath transthoracic echo showed normal biventricular cavity size and regional/global systolic function.
He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**5-17**], which revealed three vessel coronary artery disease with normal ventricular function.
TTE revealed normal biventricular cavity size and regional/global systolic function with mild aortic valve sclerosis.
