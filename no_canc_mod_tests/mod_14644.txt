Pt was found to have intermittent episodes of bradycardia secondary to Mobitz type 2.
An echo was performed which showed EF 25-30%; anterior, septal, apical akinesis; mild-mod MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 29817**] was performed which found LAD stenosis of 90-95%, RCA lesion 80-85%, LVEDF 20-28mmHg.

[**2197-12-12**] CXR portable: AP PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is a temporay pacer wire, whose distal marker is in the right ventricle.
In the left upper lung zone, there is an ill-defined opacity, for which a follow up PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended when the patient is stable for further evaluation of this finding.
3) Ill-defined opacity in the left upper lobe for which a PA and lateral chest radiograph study is recommended prior to patient discharge.
Again, note is made of left upper lobe nodular opacity, as mentioned on the previous study, as well as possible small nodular opacities in the right lower lobe.
CXR was performed after the procedure, which showed the pacer leads in place.
CXR post-pacer placement showed mild CHF with increased effusion.
HTN: During hospitalization, BP was well-controlled on ACE and BB with BP range of 104-150 systolic.
Anemia: Hct on admission was 27.9 decreased from 34 at outside hospital.
