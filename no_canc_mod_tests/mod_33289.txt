Multiplanar reformatted images were generated.
There is approximately 6 mm of associated rightward, subfalcine herniation of the midline.
This appears stable compared to the recent MR.  MRI Brain [**6-20**]: TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired.
To further evaluate MRV of the head or CTA venography of the head and neck are recommended.
CT venography of the head and neck may provide further information .
Further evaluation with CT venography of the head and neck recommended.
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Evolving mixed acute and chronic left subdural hematoma displays no significant interval change in size from prior exam.
CT OF THE NECK WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Jugular veins are patent.
The abnormality seen on MRI was likely due to flow artifact.
Head CT [**2178-6-21**]: FINDINGS: There has been interval left frontal craniotomy, with evacuation of a left subdural hematoma.
There is a rightward subfalcine herniation of approximately 4 mm, which is improved from prior study (previously 7 mm).
CT of the head was done revealing a left sided acute on chronic SDH.
MRI was also performed at the OSH prior to transfer.
He was admitted to the neurosurgery floor with plans to take him to the operating room on the subsequent day for left sided crani for evacuation of blood components.
He did not lose consciousness and his neuro exam was unchanged.
Therefore a head CT was not performed.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day).
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
