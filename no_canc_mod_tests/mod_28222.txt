PHYSICAL EXAM:  VITAL SIGNS: 97.1, 72, 121/78, 18, 99% O2 sat on room air.
Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Pulse exam shows palpable femorals, popliteals, DPs and PTs 2+ bilaterally.
She underwent a CT scan which showed a large saccular aneurysm from the aortic root 5-cm through the celiac and renal arteries with a large superceliac thrombus with a contrast extravasation with multiple liver and kidney cysts.
The patient's admitting white count was 8.3, hematocrit 32, platelet count 190.
BUN 40, creatinine 1.7, K 4.3.
Patient was begun on antihypertensives to maintain her systolic blood pressure at less than 130.
Left ventricular cavity size and function was normal with an ejection fraction of 64%.
An echo was obtained which demonstrated that the left atrium was elongated.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Cardiology felt that the patient's cardiac function would be improved with planned surgery, in addition to blood pressure control, and effective beta blockade, and nitroglycerin afterload to improve coronary perfusion.
The patient proceeded on [**12-5**] and underwent a repair of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (descending thoracic aorta to renals) with a beveled anastomosis.
Hematocrit was 31.2, BUN 32, creatinine 1.3.
From a cardiac standpoint, she did well, although she had a right bundle branch block change on her EKG on postoperative day 2.
Her hematocrit was 27.7.
Recommendations were to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30, increase her beta blockade, and repeat an EKG to see if there was resolution of her right bundle branch block.
Her cardiac enzymes were unremarkable.
Patient's chest tubes remained in place, and Foley remained in place.
Her hydralazine was increased for rate and systolic blood pressure control.
White count was 11.6, hematocrit 33.1, BUN 60, creatinine 2.4 down from 2.5, lactate 1.3.
Exam showed 1+ edema in the lower extremities.
Patient's blood pressure improved by postoperative day 4 with a systolic of 125.
Her electrolytes were repleted.
Renal function continued to be monitored.
Repeat chest x-ray showed significant improvement in her pleural effusion.
The patient has also been instructed to continue her antihypertensive medications as prescribed and to follow-up with her primary care physician for continued blood pressure management.
Positive P-MIBI for moderate lateral wall reversible     defect and an echo ejection fraction of 55%.
