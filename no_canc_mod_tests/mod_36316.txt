The hematemesis resolved, but all other issues continued to be problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
Renal failure: Elevated Creatinine and decreased UOP - Patient with Cr of 1.6 BL now 2.0 more or less this entire admission, unknown baseline.
- Previously, urine lytes showed ATN, now, lytes consistent with pre-renal state - Will give 500ml of 5% albumin  for fluid and albumin resus - Parancetesis on [**8-13**] with goal to relieve pressure on renal vasculature which may be contributing to ARF  #.
Labs of peritoneal fluid consistent with cirrhosis  # Gaseous distension of colon: Ongoing problem for this Pt.
- Add back lactulose as tolerated and lactulose enema x 1 today - [**Month (only) 116**] be contributing to high intraabdominal pressure which may be complicating ARF  #.
Urine cultures X2 negative here.
CXR concerning for aspiration.
Hematemesis - From bleeding gastric ulcer.
HIV - CD count 170 here.
- started atovaquone - ID holding HAART for now given poor PO absorption  #.
