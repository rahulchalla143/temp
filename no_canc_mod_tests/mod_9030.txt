Initially when she presented to [**Location (un) 620**]: 4:21 pm - ETOH neg, tylenol 87, aspirin 9.7 6:45 pm - LFTs neg, tylenol 40.3, aspirin 63.2 bicarb=24.5 Cr 1, K 4.6 EKG: QRS 102 She was started on a bicarb drip at [**Location (un) 620**], given activated charcoal, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for toxicology.
An EKG showed sinus rhythm at 90, NA/NI, TWI in III.
CXR shows bilateral increased vascular markings but no acute infiltrate.
Initial tox screen showed ASA=42 and Tylenol=44.
She was started on bicarb drip at 150cc/hr titrated to 1-2cc/kg/hour urine output.
Bicarb was to be stopped when aspirin level is 30 or less.

No previous tracing available for comparison  Imaging: AP CXR on admission: IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for pulmonary edema.
CXR [**2183-2-27**] The heart size is top normal.
Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is suggestive of a tiny pleural effusion.
ASA levels have trended from 9.7->63.2->42->93.8->128.
She was initially treated with N-acetylcysteine for the Tylenol ingestion, but her serum levels trended down and NAC was stopped as she was below the nomogram.
Her Aspirin levels and ABG were trended every 2 hours.
She required three pressors (phenylephrine, neosynephrine, and vasopressin) to get her blood pressures high enough for dialysis.
With 6 hours of dialysis, her Aspirin level went from a peak level of 128 to 30.
Her mental status slowly improved and respiratory rate trended back to normal.
Hypernatremia: She was hypernatremic on presentation, but blood sodium levels dropped to low 130s on the bicarbonate drip.
Following discontinuation of the bicarb drip, her sodium came up to 148.
The patient had large urine output, dilute urine with urine osmolality 133 with serum osmolality 304.  Review of outpatient labs at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] revealed that hyponatremia has been chronic since at least 07/[**2181**].
Her abdominal ultrasound also showed microcystic changes in the kidneys, consistent with lithium toxicity.
Her lithium levels were in the therapeutic range, and lithium was stopped during this hospitalization as above.
Hypotension:  She had been persistently hypotensive after her toxic ingestion of ASA, likely due to vasodilation from direct aspirin toxicity, possibly complicated by an aspirin bezoar or sepsis from aspiration pneumonia.
Following transfer to the floor, her blood pressure stabilised and trended up to SBP in the 150s.
We restarted her home lisinopril and her blood pressures were stable and well-controlled at the time of discharge.
She will complete a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia on [**2183-3-13**]  Medications on Admission: -Levothyroxine 88mcg daily -Lithium 300mg [**Hospital1 **] -Citalopram 20mg daily -Dulcolax daily -MVI daily -Glycopyrrolate 1mg TID -Clonazepam 0.5mg daily -Lisinopril 2.5mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. miconazole nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).
Blood and urine tests suggested that this is probably a condition called "nephrogenic diabetes insipidus" a condition in which the body makes excess amounts of dilute urine and causes the sodium level in the blood to rise.
An ultrasound scan of your kidneys showed some cysts in your kidney, which may also be related to lithium.
