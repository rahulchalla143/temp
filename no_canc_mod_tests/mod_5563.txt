He was found to be confused and brought to an OSH where head CT showed chronic bilateral subdural hematomas.

FINDINGS: HEAD CT: There are moderate-sized bilateral subdural hematomas, mildly hyperdense suggesting a subacute nature.
HEAD AND NECK CTA: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent without evidence of stenosis.
CT Head 12/4(7:16am) FINDINGS: There are bilateral subdural hematomas, the left measuring 10 mm compared to 13 mm in prior, and the right measuring 18 mm compared to 16 mm on the prior.
CT Head [**11-12**] (5:40pm)-Post-op FINDINGS: Two parietal burr holes are identified bilaterally and patient is status post surgical evacuation of bilateral large subdural hematomas.
CT Head [**11-15**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Unchanged bilateral subdural hematomas and unchanged mass effect compared to prior study on [**2133-11-14**].
As his neurological examination was quite good on admission, he was admitted to the neurosurgical step-down unit.
An emergent head CT was done, and identified worsening of bilateral SDH.
He had a CTA which was negative for malformation.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain.
