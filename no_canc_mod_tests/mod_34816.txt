**FINAL REPORT [**2197-5-2**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2197-5-2**]):       YEAST.
Lumbar Spine ([**2197-4-27**]) CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with posterior fusion.
Lumbar Spine ([**2197-4-28**]) FINDINGS: There has been interval L3-L4 posterior fusion including placement of an interbody fusion spacer, although depiction is limited.
ECG ([**2197-5-1**]) Sinus rhythm.
However, urine culture later grew yeast (8000/mL), which was not subsequently treated since she was asymptomatic.
#) Leukocytosis: WBC count 13.2 on day of admission and peaked as high as 26.7 before trending back down to 11.4 prior to discharge.
Hematocrit was stable for 4 days prior to discharge.
Other possibilities included C. diff but patient was afebrile with normal abdominal exam and had decreasing WBC.
Stool was sent for C.diff toxin and returned negative.
She has not been on an aspirin or an ACE-I, which may be beneficial given her diabetic history.
