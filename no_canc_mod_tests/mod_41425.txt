Left subclavian CVL was subsequently placed and CVP was [**2-23**], with decrease inurine output.
Given her prior aggressive diuresis, she was given 500cc IVF followed by maintenance IVF and 1u pRBC with improvement in her urine output.
Her baseline Hct is 24.
She is a very difficult cross-match; did receive one unit pRBCs with repeat Hct prior to transfer of 23.7.

ECHO ([**2192-3-31**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Pathology Crossmatch ([**2192-3-30**]): Ms [**Known lastname 1968**] has a new diagnosis of anti-E antibody.
Limited carotid ultrasound ([**2192-4-2**]) 1.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**2192-4-4**]): FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Blood cultures neg on admission and neg from OSH.
Sputum culture had no growth.
HR consistently on 90s, so placed pt on metoprolol rather than atenolol to get targeted HR control and uptitrated as needed to achieve goal rate of 60-70s.
Obtained echo which showed AoVA of 1.0cm^2 with mean gradient of 30mmHg.
She became afebrile and her WBC count normalized.
# severe AS: pt has normal EF on echo but severe AS, mild LVH, and pulm artery HTN.
Valve area=0.9, peak=33, mean=20 in [**2190**].
40-59% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery), MSSA swab (positive), and cardiac cath (result: AS moderate, wedge 14-15, CI 2.3, 60-70% proximal LAD lesion).
# Nutrition:  Patient failed speech and swallow evaluation initially.
Repeat speech and swallow evaluation was as follows recommendations:  1.
# HTN: BP was stable off home meds.
# Anemia, acute on chronic: Pt has a h/o anemia (Hct 28) and was stable on arrival to the OSH, but had a precipitous drop the day of transfer to Hct 20.
Hct bumped appropriately with 1u pRBCs to Hct 23 at OSH.
iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
Calcium 600 600 mg (1,500 mg) Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] for an exacerbation of your heart failure and pneumonia.
Discontinue Atenolol, furosemide, nifedipine, Maalox, lorazepam and omeprazole 2.
