Her vital signs at the outside hospital on admission were temperature 98.9, pulse 65, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 74/39, O2 saturation 84% on room air, which increased to 93% on four liters by nasal cannula.
Laboratory data was significant for a white blood cell count of 34.5, CK 6,036, AST 23,580, ALT 14,130, total bilirubin 0.6, alkaline phosphatase 126.
Serum toxicology screen was negative.
Potassium was 6.8, bicarbonate 12.
An arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.27, PCO2 31, and PO2 77 on two liters nasal cannula.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were temperature 99.8, blood pressure 123/71, pulse 85, oxygen saturation 97% on four liters by nasal cannula.
Lungs:  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Her extremities were warm and she had 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to the intensive care unit her white count was 25, hematocrit 34.3, platelet count 180, PT 20.7, PTT 34.1, INR 2.8.
Chem-7:  Sodium 137, potassium 3.6, chloride 100, bicarbonate 23, BUN 46, creatinine 4.5, glucose 255.
Her alkaline phosphatase was 127, total bilirubin 0.8, lipase 70, amylase 101, albumin 3.2, ALT 12,133, AST 20,570, LDH 21,890.
Her CMV antibody titers were consistent with an old infection as there was no IgM present.
An RPR test for syphilis was also found to be nonreactive.
A Doppler ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis was performed.
The hepatic venous Doppler interrogation was suggestive of a hyperdynamic state, however the hepatic vasculature was otherwise unremarkable, and there was no focal liver mass.
She was also started prophylactically on antibiotics with ceftriaxone and fluconazole until the results of her infectious work-up returned as negative.
At the time of admission her creatinine was elevated to 4.5.
A renal consultation was obtained to consider starting hemodialysis.
A renal ultrasound was performed which showed normal- sized kidneys.
Urine electrolytes were obtained which showed a picture consistent with acute tubular necrosis.
The hemodialysis sessions were spaced further apart when the patient started producing more urine and she was started on diuretics to encourage urine output.
Hypertension:  On admission the patient was hypotensive at the outside hospital, however soon after being transferred to the intensive care unit, the patient started to develop extremely elevated and labile blood pressures to a systolic blood pressure of 200.
She was briefly on a labetalol drip in the intensive care unit and required multiple medications to control her blood pressure.
The cause for her increased blood pressure was believed to be due partly to the acute renal failure and also partly due to agitation.
It was noted that when the patient became extremely agitated, that her blood pressure would increase.
At the time of discharge, however, the patient's blood pressure was well controlled with a systolic blood pressure from 120 to 160 on metoprolol, amlodipine, and Clonidine.
Since the Ativan was not able to control her seizures, she was started on a Dilantin load and was transferred from the floor to the intensive care unit for further management.
A work-up was performed and her head CT showed bilateral frontal hypodensities as well as bilateral thalamic hypodensities.
An MRI was then performed which showed posterior leukoencephalopathy likely due to extremely elevated blood pressures combined with renal failure.
