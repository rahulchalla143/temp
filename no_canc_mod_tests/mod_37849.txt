A chest x-ray was obtained and revealed stable cardiomegaly with a tortuous and calcified aorta.
An underlying pneumonia could not be excluded.
The overall impression was that this chest x-ray revealed improvement of her underlying congestive heart failure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   The patient's temperature was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 138/72, her heart rate was 93, her respiratory rate was 90, and she was saturating 94% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the extraocular movements were intact.

Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm.
Her heart rate stabilized to the middle 90s; which was down from 160 to 140.
The following day a cardiac echocardiogram was obtained which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size was normal and the left ventricular ejection fraction was greater than 55%.
An electrocardiogram was also obtained which demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled.
She was not discharged back to the nursing home, however, because her white blood cell count remained elevated.
