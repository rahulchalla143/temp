Admission Date:  [**2145-1-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2145-1-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-3-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59 year old male with a past medical history significant for an atrioseptal defect repair at age 18, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45% and a recent cardiac myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension and mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation.
Over the two weeks prior to admission he had noticed an increasing heart rate from his baseline in the 60s to a heart rate in the 120s.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.5, hematocrit 38.1, platelets 254, INR 1.8.
Sodium 140, potassium 5.2, BUN 38, creatinine .7, TSH 1.8, Digoxin level less than 0.2.
ALT 14, AST 31, alkaline phosphatase 283, total bilirubin 1.0, amylase 71, glucose tolerance test  317.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter.
Echocardiogram showed moderate dilated left atrium, no atrioseptal defect, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe left ventricular systolic function and moderately dilated right ventricle.
Of note, this echocardiogram was performed when the patient was tachycardiac.
Hypotension - The patient was initially mildly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
In addition the patient was started on Verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s.
Chest x-rays revealed evidence of congestive heart failure.
The decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient's heart failure.
Abnormal liver function tests - The patient had an isolated, elevated alkaline phosphatase with a confirmatory elevation in his gamma glutamyl transferase.
An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, however, an irregular hepatic contour was seen which is suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease.
There was some concern that the patient may have a partial biliary obstruction and the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to further evaluate the biliary system.
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any evidence of biliary dilatation or of any obstructing pancreatic mass.
His neurological examination at that time was nonfocal and the head was atraumatic without any evidence of a hematoma.
A computerized axial tomography scan of his head at that time did not reveal any extra or intracranial hemorrhage.
