The patient had a cardiac cath which is unchanged from [**3-10**].
He also had an TTE demonstrating reduced EF (30-35%) compared to 1 year ago (40%).
Review of symptoms unable to be obtained [**1-5**] sedation.
AS status post AVR in [**2196**] which is a tissue valve.
Right MCA infarct [**12/2198**] 14.
Systolic and diastolic dysfunction presumed to be secondary to hypertensive diabetic and valvular heart disease.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: T afebrile, BP 107/35, HR 61, RR 12, O2 100% on AC 50%/Tv 500/RR 12/PEEP 5 Gen: obese man, intubated, sedated.
CXR at [**Hospital3 **] ([**2-25**]): The diaphragms are markedly elevated with low lung volumes.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2199-2-25**] demonstrated (per [**Hospital1 **] ECHO report): Technically difficult study.
Global LV systolic function is moderately to severely reduced with an estimated EF of 30-35%.
Compared to prior study dated [**2198-6-30**], LV systolic function appears somewhat lower on the current study.
ETT performed on [**11-8**] demonstrated: A Dobutamine stress echo was carried out during which time peak HR of 127bpm was obtained (86% of maximum predicted HR).
Aortic valve moderately calcified with 40mmHg peak gradient and 20mmHg mean valve gradient.
This represents no significant change from prior study of [**2196-11-8**].
Peak gradient increased to 65mmHg with mean gradient of 26 mmHg.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2199-2-25**] demonstrated:  The patient had a cardiac cath which is unchanged from [**3-10**].
He is LAV 40% ostial lesion, left circumflex, 70% ostial lesion, RCA 40% mid lesion and he describes to us left circumflex is patent.
LABORATORY DATA: notable for BL Cr 1.2, 1.5 on admission to [**Hospital1 **] with hct 34 on admission and 30 upon transfer.

Rhythm: He found to have 2 automatic foci which were the cause of his VT storm on presentation.
On the day of presentation, he underwent successful ablation of 1 of the 2 VT foci with other focus easily controlled in lab with burst pacing after pacer adjustment.
He continued to have periods of ventricular rhythms which were paced out, though s/p VT on [**3-1**] which was too slow to burst pace per pacer settings, likely because of amio.
On morning of [**3-2**], patient triggered for VT at 116-126 bpm SBP 90-110s.
Patient had his lower pacing rate increased to 75bpm and subsequently, patient had no more episodes of VT. His mexiletine was titrated up to 648mg TID with QT of 560 which was corrected for wide QRS to 480ms which was minimally changed from his pre-quinidine QT.
He had no episodes of VT on this regimen and was discharged on telemetry monitoring with paced HR ranging in 70s.
CAD/Ischemia: Cath showed unchanged disease from previous.
LDL 117 at OSH.
Pump: Depressed EF to 30-35% compared to ECHO last year, with CXR e/o pleural effusion and pulmonary edema.
Hct 34->30 at [**Hospital3 **] and then ->25, now improved to 28.4.
Patient's Hct remained stable throughout his hospital course with no indication of acute bleeding.
Creatinine peaked at 2.0, and on discharge was 1.2-1.3.
Cr bump likely pre-renal given significant diuresis and dry appearance on exam vs. contrast nephropathy from recent cath at [**Hospital3 **].
Restarted low dose lisinopril and lasix - titrated as Cr and BP allow.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Final diagnosis Recurrent ventricular tachycardia  Secondary diagnosis Coronary artery disease Systolic congestive heart failure Acute on chronic renal fialure Hypertension Urinary retention   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a procedure to deactivate areas of your heart which were firing irregularly.
