His mobility at baseline is severely limited by his weight and shortness of breath.
His arterial blood gases on 100% oxygen by face mask in the Emergency Department was 729/64/236.
He was placed on BIPAP and his subsequent arterial blood gases was 7.24/63/87 with a bicarbonate of 29, BUN and creatinine 28/1.8, unknown baseline.
He was felt to be in congestive heart failure by exam and chest x-ray and was given diuretics.
Echocardiogram by report at outside hospital also demonstrated mild aortic stenosis with anteroseptal and inferoseptal hypokinesis that was severe and ejection fraction of 30% to 35%.
Subsequently, he was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for further management.
Mucomyst in anticipation of possible cardiac catheterization  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.1?????
?, blood pressure 140/70, pulse 80, respiratory rate 19, O2 saturations 90% to 96% on 100% face mask.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
ADMISSION LABS:  White blood cell count 18.8, hematocrit 43.8, platelets 202.
Sodium 148, potassium 4.6, chloride 107, bicarbonate 32, BUN 13, creatinine 1.5, glucose 126.
IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 80, PR interval 170, left axis deviation with poor R-wave progression, Qs in V2, V3, no ST-T changes.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Echocardiogram done at our institution showed that his AS was not severe.
Given his echocardiogram results, it was decided that the patient would not need an emergent catheter.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to assess his pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and to guide management of his congestive heart failure.
On the afternoon of [**2139-12-6**], the patient had an episode of apnea on pressure support, was subsequently changed to CMV and had an additional episode of hypertension with systolic blood pressures to 60.
He subsequently was started on dopamine and blood pressure recovered slowly.
Further neurologic exam reveals 5 mm fixed dilated bilaterally and non reactive, no response to sternal rub or noxious stimuli.
A stat head CT was obtained which showed a large cerebellar bleed involving mid brain obscuring the pontine angle.
