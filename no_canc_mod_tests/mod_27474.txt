Her anion gap closed, and her bicarb normalized.
Her hematocrit did fall by approximately 3 points, and the patient complained of chronic RLQ pain for which there was some concern of retroperitoneal bleed.
However, her hematocrit stabilized and later CT abdomen demonstrated no evidence of hematoma.
Her iron studies and folate level were unremarkable, though her B12 was borderline low.
As above, a CT abdomen was negative for hematoma.
The patient has been afebrile, has had multiple negative urinalyses since her initial U/A demonstrated large blood.
Two repeat levels demonstrated normalization.
There is no further work-up indicated at this time.
