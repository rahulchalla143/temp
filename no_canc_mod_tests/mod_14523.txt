Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with noted hypokinesis of the apical anterior segment and apex.
[**2190-2-18**] ECHO The chest tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and mediastinal drains have all been removed.
[**MD Number(1) 1288**]  PROCEDURE: 1.
FINDINGS:  Her coronary angiograms showed an 80% stenosis of the left anterior descending.
Intraoperative echo showed a moderate mitral regurgitation.
Hemostasis was secured along the sternal borders and the left internal mammary artery was taken down.
A cardioplegia needle was inserted into the ascending aorta which will also be used for de-airing.
For a brief period, the EKG showed an ischemic pattern of the inferior leads; however, this reverted back to baseline.
The hemostasis was checked with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 30565**] expander and the patient was taken off from bypass with some Nor-epinephrine.
Once again, hemostasis was checked and chest wall was then closed in layers.
[**MD Number(1) 1288**]   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2190-2-16**] and taken to the operating room where she underwent single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting and a mitral valve repair.
She was weaned from her vasoactive drips and transferred to the floor on POD #1 for further recovery.
She was transfused for a HCT of 23.
Her INR became supratherapeutic and she was given FFP and vitamin K.  Her confusion resolved and her INR came down to 1.3.
