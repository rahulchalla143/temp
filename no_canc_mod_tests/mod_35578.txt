She underwent flexible bronchoscopy on the afternoon of admission, and airways were found to be narrowed throughout, L main stent in good position, moderate granulation tissue at proximal end with 80% obstruction and severe granulation at distal end of the stent with only a pinhole opening to the lower and upper segments of the left upper and lower lobes.

Echo The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-9-14**], the findings are similar.

# SOB / fibrosing mediastinitis: Pt had a flex bronch [**11-25**] that showed severe stenosis of L main stent [**3-12**] granulation tissue.
V/Q scan [**11-26**] showed hypoperfusion and hypoventilation of L lung, CT chest, bronchial washings with commensal resp flora.
ECG was repeated which showed decreased rate in the 60s with frequent PACs of unclear etiology.
On the morning of hospital day 3 cardiac exam was normal.
Levaquin and Metronidazole were started initially on [**2182-11-27**] and cultures were sent.
Vanco levels were borderline low (9.5 and 9.7) therefore doses of vanco were increased to 1250mg and then 1500mg for the last 2 days of treatment respectively.
An echocardiogram showed EF >60%, preserved global systolic function and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
#Anemia: HCT dropped to 30 from 35 with recent baseline in mid-to-low 30s.
