The patient has never previously experienced GI bleeding and per PCP notes the patient underwent colonoscopy in [**2140**] which was normal.
On initial arrival the patient was with BP 102/57 which dropped to 77/43 on admission, improved to 100/50 with 1L NS and 2Units PRBCs.
The patient received 1 additional unit of blood [**2144-9-22**] at 9am with Hct bump from 28.1 to 31.7, stable to 33.1 over 24 hours without additional transfusion (3Units PRBC total).
[**Name (NI) 6**] Echocardiogram was obtained which was revealing for a hyperdynamic LVEF >75% and severe resting LVOT gradient and moderate to severe Mitral regurgitation.
After patient transfer, [**Name (NI) 653**] by lab that 2 bottles from single set of blood cultures from the CVL placement had grown out gram positive cocci, which initially were treated with vancomycin, but ultimately were judged to be contaminant, given no fever and negative peripheral cultures.
On [**9-24**] she again experienced frank hematochezia, and so underwent repeat colonscopy on [**9-25**], during which they were unable to pass the scope beyond 35cm due to a stricture.
A CT Abdomen revealed a stricture, but no mass, so surgery was consulted, who felt no immediate need for surgery given lack of obstruction.

Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the sigmoid colon from the abnormal appearing mucosa.
Given worry about mass, a CT Abdomen was performed as above.
The stricture was confirmed on CT but no obvious mass seen - Patient had not had further bleeding x72 hours at time of discharge - Hematocrit has been stable at time of discharge - Given stricture in the sigmoid, we obtained a surgical consult, who concurred that watchful waiting is best given her high risk for surgery, and the lack of obstruction or other surgical lesions.
She does not have nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, or pain and her vital signs are stable.
A biopsy is pending and the results will be sent to her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
- She was placed on oxygen and monitored by serial CXR - After 24 hours with lack of improvement a DART chest tube was placed by interventional radiology.
Bacterial UTI - treated with Cipro for pan sensitive Klebsiella  4.
Pelvic Fracture - Note non-healing acetabulum - Pain control with Tylenol 1 gm QID and Lidoderm Patch.
- Patient's daughter will set up FU with [**Hospital3 2568**] orthopedics - Physical Therapy  5.
Tachycardia - In the MICU, most likely MAT in setting of a pneumothorax and anemia - Resolved with variation in heart rate of 80 to 100 - continus metoprolol for rate control  6.
Bactremia - only 1 set of cultures were positive, which was presumed to be contamination  7.
Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy, MR - Preload Dependent - Cardiology was consulted who recommended continuing Metoprolol - Avoid reducing preload or afterload, maintain euvolemia, try to avoid diuretics, dehydration  8.
Malnutrition and edema due to hypoalbuminemia - Diet and protein supplements - avoid diuretics if possible  CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI, confirmed w/daughter (HCP) ?????
