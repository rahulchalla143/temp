Pregnancy was a spontaneous monochorionic diamniotic twin gestation with concordant fetal growth.
Apgar scores were 9 at one and 9 at five minutes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission birth weight was 1065 g (25th to 50th percentile), head circumference 25.6 cm (50th percentile), length 36.5 cm (25th to 50th percentile).
The baby was [**Name2 (NI) 43619**], palate intact, red light reflex equal bilaterally, moderate costal retractions with fair breath sounds, regular, rate and rhythm, no murmur, no femoral pulses, benign abdominal exam with three-vessel umbilical cord, no organomegaly, anus patent, normal female genitalia for gestational age, normal neurologic exam for gestational age, hips stable.
There was a dramatic increase in her apnea of bradycardiac episodes on day of life #8 for which a sepsis evaluation was initiated.
This evaluation revealed Staphylococcus epidermitis bacteremia and anemia.
The murmur persisted, and an echocardiogram on day of life #3 revealed a moderate size patent ductus arteriosis measuring 3.3 mm with continuous left-to-right flow.
Given her persistent oliguria, Indomethacin was not restarted; however, the murmur spontaneously decreased in intensity, and a repeat echocardiogram on day of life #5, showed a small patent ductus arteriosis that intermittently closed during the echocardiogram.
Her murmur has subsequently resolved, and her blood pressures have remained stable.
Twenty-four hour electrolytes were normal except for an elevated sodium at 148.
A total of three sodium bicarbonate boluses were required to treat this metabolic acidosis.
BUN and creatinine on day of life #5 were 57 and 1.3 respectively.
Over the next few days, urine output improved from a low of 0.6 cc/kg/hr to a normal amount.
A repeat set of electrolytes were sent at day of life #7 with improvement in BUN and creatinine to 41 and 1.0.
Last set of electrolytes were on [**2-4**] with a sodium of 139, potassium 5.3, chloride 101, bicarb 22, glucose 97.
Weight at time of transfer is 1200 g.  She has been gaining weight slowly but consistently on her current regimen.
Peak bilirubin was on day of life #8 at 4.9.
Phototherapy has subsequently been discontinued with a rebound bilirubin of 3.5.
Hematology:  Maternal blood type O-, antibody negative, baby's blood type is O+, antibody negative.
The patient received a transfusion of 15 cc/kg of packed red blood cells on day of life #13 secondary to a hematocrit of 27.7.
Last hematocrit was on [**2-4**] (day of life #19) which was 38.7%.
Infectious disease:  Sepsis evaluation was initiated on admission for prematurity and respiratory distress.
CBC at that time showed a white blood cell count of 5.8, with 16% polys, 75% lymphs, hematocrit 42%, and platelet count 263.
Ampicillin and Gentamicin were initiated and continued until the blood cultures had no growth for 48 hours.
A sepsis evaluation at that time showed a white blood cell count of 13.7, with 37% polys, and 1% bands, hematocrit 30%, platelet count 379.
Blood cultures were sent.
Antibiotics were not initially started given the benign differential, but were started when the blood cultures grew out Staphylococcus epidermitis at approximately 24 hours.
Vancomycin and Gentamicin were started on [**1-26**] after a repeat blood culture was sent.
Antibiotics were initially given through a PICC line; however, the line was discontinued after a repeat blood culture also grew an identical organism with identical sensitivities.
Lumbar puncture was performed on [**1-28**] which showed no evidence of meningitis, and the repeat blood cultures had no growth.
Sensory:  Hearing screen and ophthalmologic exam have not yet been performed.
Routine healthcare maintenance:  Newborn screen was sent of [**1-19**] and was normal except for a borderline thyroxin of 5.0 (normal values greater than 5).
Repeat newborn screen was sent on [**1-29**] was normal.
Prematurity at 28 and 3/7 weeks gestational age.
