The diaphragms are not optimally seen, presumably related to confluence of overlying soft tissue, patient motion, and possible pulmonary opacities which are not excluded on this study and must be placed in clinical context.
LENIs IMPRESSION: Limited study with incomplete evaluation of the proximal left superficial femoral vein, otherwise, no evidence of DVT.
Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2113-8-9**], symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy is more prominent and right ventricular enlargement with free wall hypokinesis is now apparent.
Possible infiltrate on CXR so the patient completed levofloxacin x 5 days.
Also, PE was considered given that she had a history in the past.
LENIs were negative bilaterally.
INR 1.3 on discharge.
She will need to have INR checked daily.
INR goal [**2-10**] and will need this for 6 months.
She was rapidly corrected once her Bipap machine was functioning properly.
You were treated with oxygen and a BIPAP mask.
