Transferred to outside hospital where CT reportedly showed SAH.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

CT Head [**1-14**]:  1.
CT Head [**1-16**] AM: worsening rightsided edema and leftward shift  CT Head [**1-16**] Right lower extremity Doppler ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right leg  CT Head [**1-16**] Postop: Extension of craniectomy seen with right middle cerebral artery infarct.
MRI Head [**1-18**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
A large SAH was seen on CT from OSH, and an EVD was placed.
CTA was obtained, however dye timing was off and a second scan was required.
A post-operative cerebral angiogram showed no sign of vasospasm of other aneurysm but showed no distal flow.
[**1-14**] Pt had repeat CT head that showed decrease in midline shift and evolving R MCA infarct.
Her dilantin was transistioned to Keppra and EEG monitoring was ordered.
Her blood pressures were kept 100-160.
[**1-15**]: Repeat CT head showed increased swelling and worsening of R MCA infarct.
She was started on Mannitol 25g Q4 and serum Na and OSM were checked q4 hours.
Her EVD remaiend at 15cm above the tragus and continued to drain well.
A TTE was obtained for baseline cardiac function.
[**1-16**]: Pt's clinical exam worsened and she was no longer withdrawing her right side.
Repeat Head CT demonstrated worsening cerebral edema and increased leftward shift.
Given her clinical deterioration and worsening Head CT the decision was made to extend the craniectomy site to allow for more expansion.
Postop Head CT demonstrated minimally improved midline shift.
[**Date range (1) 25556**]: No significant improvements were noted in the the patient's exam, a new finding of a forced downward gaze and occular bobbing led to an MRI which showed bihemespheric strokes.
Her exam remained poor.
