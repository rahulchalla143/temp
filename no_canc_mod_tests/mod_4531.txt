Gastrointestinal bleed: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to this facility with an INR of 15.4 and reporting melena since his stenting and bright red blood per rectum for the past few days prior to admission.
His INR improved with administration of vitamin K and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.
He also received 4 units of packed red blood cells for his hematocrit of 21.
An EGD revealed gastritis but no acute bleed.
His plavix and aspirin were restarted once his hematocrit had been stable for 2 days.
It was restarted on the day of discharge and the patient's blood pressures have tolerated it well.
Congestive heart failure: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a history of CHF with EF of 20% with RV apical akinesis and an apical left ventricular aneurysm.
In addition to aggressive diuresis to avoid volume overload, he received at least 8 units of blood products for his GIB and to prevent further myocardial ischemia.
Although his ins and outs were negative, Mr. [**Known lastname **] soon developed respiratory failure.
Cardiogenic Shock: Shortly after his intubation, Mr. [**Known lastname **]' systolic blood pressures fell to the 70s.
These pressors were titrated to maintain a mean arterial pressure greater than 65.
His pulmonary artery catheter revealed pressures consistent with volume overload and cardiogenic shock (CVP 18, RA 15, RV 58/20, PA 58/27/40, PCWP 24).
The patient's cardiac markers were cycled and were consistent with new ischemia, although a later transthoracic echo was unchanged.
He was transfused intermittently to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30.
Atrial fibrillation/SVT: One day after placement of the PA catheter, the patient developed hypotension with a narrow complex tachycardia, which did not break with carotid massage.
The dobutamine, dopamine, and norepinephrine were turned off.
His endotracheal secretions grew out serratia and he responded well to piperacillin/ tazobactam.
Acute Renal Failure: Mr. [**Known lastname **]' baseline creatinine is 1.5 but when he presented, it was 3.1.
Once his cardiogenic shock resolved and perfusion to his kidneys improved, Mr. [**Known lastname **]' creatinine trended down.
The patient's sodium has been stable in the last few days prior to discharge.
The patient will need close monitoring for his lithium level and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5715**].
Thrombocytosis - the patients platelet count has been trending up.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed.
Please adjust level to goal INR [**2-8**].
Lithium Carbonate 150 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)): Please check lithium levels every [**4-11**] days or as directed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5715**].
Please monitor closely and keep lithium level <1.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: cardiogenic shock atrial fibrillation acute renal failure gastrointestinal bleed, gastritis bipolar disorder congestive heart failure with EF of 15% coronary artery disease s/p MI and stenting ventilator associated pneumonia hypernatremia hypercalcemia transient atrioventricular node reentrent tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Improved.
