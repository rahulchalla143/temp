However, the next day the patient became febrile with a temperature maximum of 103.
The patient's liver function tests continued to rise, and a computerized axial tomography a right hepatic lobe infarction.
In the Emergency Department, his vital signs revealed temperature was 97.2, blood pressure was 119/60, heart rate was 100, and his oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.
His hematocrit dropped to 23.4.
As mentioned previously, the patient was admitted on [**2166-5-27**] and underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt on [**5-31**] which was complicated by localized hepatic infarction and was subsequently admitted on [**6-8**].
Echocardiogram with a normal ejection fraction of 60% and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97.2, blood pressure was 119/60, heart rate was 100, respiratory rate was 18, and oxygen saturation was 985 on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Neck examination revealed no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 1+ bilaterally.
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   The patient's laboratory values on admission revealed white blood cell count was 5.6, hematocrit was 23.4, and platelets were 105.
Sodium was 133, potassium was 4.5, chloride was 114, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 13, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was 194.
ALT was 146, AST was 113, alkaline phosphatase was 199, lactate dehydrogenase was 281, and total protein was 3.1.
INR was 1.6.
The patient had a Doppler ultrasound showing reversible flow in the left portal vein, and decreased transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt velocities, and worsening ascites; consistent with decreased transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt patency.
However, an ultrasound from [**6-11**] showed slowed flow through the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
An ultrasound was repeated the following morning.
The repeat ultrasound showed patent forward flow and increased transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt velocity; consistent with a patent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
Liver function tests were followed daily.
RENAL ISSUES:  Hyponatremia was stable; most likely secondary to end-stage liver disease/ascites/total body sodium overload.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  On [**2166-6-13**] the patient had a repeat renal ultrasound which showed good flow through the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
