IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # [**Numeric Identifier 105580**]          ([**2195-6-6**]).
ADMISSION CXR [**6-6**]  IMPRESSION: Large patchy opacification in the left mid to lower lung, concerning for pneumonia and/or aspiration.
[**6-6**] CT HEAD  IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
[**6-8**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-5-18**], the wall motion abnormality is new and c/w interim ischemia.
[**6-11**] CT HEAD IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage.
[**6-14**]  MR HEAD IMPRESSION: 1.
[**6-16**] DISCHARGE CXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated.
Improvement of the bilateral parenchymal opacities, notably on the right, the right lung now shows improved ventilation.
Her sputum culture grew MRSA and Pseudomonas and she was treated with broad spectrum ABx and eventually narrowed to Vancomycin and Cefepime based on culture sensitivities as above (of note, the very resistant Ecoli was only sparse growth and pt was clinically improving, so not specifically treated).
She had two head CT without contrast wihtout acute process (chronic changes) and an MRI that showed no acute infarct and small vessel ischemic changes and old small R cerebellar infarct.
Hypothyroidism: She was initially started on 50 mcg daily IV thyroxine; the pt's TFT's were then drawn while intubated and noted to be grossly abnormal, with TSH 9.9 --> 33 and fT4 low at 0.52 (0.93 - 1.7).
Her total T4 and T3 also noted to be low.
Her TFT's slowly improved over time to a TSH of 8.7, fT4 0.61, T3 58, T4 4.4 by discharge.
NSTEMI: The pt had lateral deep inverted TW inversions and produced cardiac enzymes with Troponin peak to 0.43 (<0.1) but never made MB fraction, all consistent with NSTEMI.
TTE showed new WMA of distal anterior septum, distal wall, apex, mild decrease of EF 45-50%.
Her cardiac enzymes trended down to normal by discharge.
Leukocytosis: The pt was admitted with WBC count 17.7, peaked to 26, and trended down however was 13.8 by discharge without any clinical decompensation to suggest further infection.
Acute kidney injury: Creatinine 1.4 on admission from baseline 0.7; this returned to [**Location 213**] by day 2 of admission with IVF's and renal fxn no further issue this admission, Cr by discharge 1.0. .
The vast maojrity of time she's mildly depressed but it's mostly situation -- as outpt was on Lexapro 20, Lamicatal 200, and Seroquel 300 (Seroquel was good bc she tends to have trouble sleeping at night).
She had some QTc prolongation during her NSTEMI so Seroquel was held which was OK with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
