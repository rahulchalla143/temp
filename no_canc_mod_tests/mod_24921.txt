There, they interpreted her CXR as PNA.
When the plts were noted to be <5 and an ABG was 7.44 /43/45 on 50% venti-mask she was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She denies bleeding gums, epistaxis, h/o bleeding disorder  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T 97.1 P 97 BP 182/79 R 34 O2 sat 96% 15L NRB.
CXR showed bilaterally patchy opacitys which were interpreted as pulmonary edema.
EKG was without significant ischemic changes.
Although tachypeic, sats remained in the mid 90s on NRB.
VS prior to transfer afebrile.

------------ EKG ([**2114-9-13**]): Sinus rhythm.
---------------- CT chest without contrast ([**2114-9-14**]): Preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**]: severe emphysema (not fibrosis) with acute involvement of upper lobes = interstitial ?pulm edema (most likely) or atypical PNA (non pus-producing, ?mycoplasm) or ?pulm hem (unlikely without hemoptysis).
Initial attending impression was of no pulmonary embolism but review of images by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Radiology suggests segmental PE in left lower lobe arteries.
------------------- ECHO ([**2114-9-16**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**2114-9-17**] IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest read in conjunction with chest radiographs and CT scans of the chest since [**9-12**], most recently CTA on [**9-16**].
Tiny left pleural effusion is comparable to the appearance on recent chest CT scans.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
However the physical exam is without signs of volume overload and the BNP is normal.
Her ECHO showed an EF>55% without significant dysfunction.
Pulmonary consult felt that this was old blood likely from when her platelets were extremely low.
Chest CT revealed no evidence of malignancy.
