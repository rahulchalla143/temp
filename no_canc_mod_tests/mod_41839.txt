He was given 1 amp of D50 and 1 mg of glucagon, and the fingerstick glucose rose to 154.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, a CT of the head was performed, which showed evidence of an old CVA, but no acute hemorrhage.
A LP was performed and was negative.
Of note on the patient's admission EKG, he did have lateral ST depressions, which were new compared with his prior EKGs from [**2128**] at [**Hospital6 2121**] as well as [**2128**].
At the time, the patient was unresponsive to deep painful stimuli, but was minimally responsive to deep sternal rub.
Coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization with three-vessel disease not intervened upon because there were no critical lesions at the time.
Date of cardiac catheterization unknown.
COPD with some component of restrictive disease as well by pulmonary function tests performed in [**2124**] demonstrating FVC and FEV1 of 30% of predicted, FEV1 to FVC ratio of 120% of predicted.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.8, blood pressure 120/72, heart rate 70, respirations 14, and 100% on AC 550/14 with a FIO2 of 1.0 and a PEEP of 5.
Chest was clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Capillary refill less than two seconds.
DATA:  White blood cell count 14.3, hematocrit 30, platelets 226.
INR 1.0.
CK 54, troponin 0.03.
Serum tox is positive for benzos, negative for aspirin, EtOH, Tylenol, barbiturates.
CSF:  No white cells, no red cells, protein 25, and glucose 83.
CT of the head:  No bleed, multiple old infarcts, sinus inflammation.
EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with T-wave inversions in V4 through V6 with ST depressions of 1 mm in V5 and V6.
An EEG was performed, which shows diffuse slow wave pattern, which ruled out status epilepticus and suggest some sort of encephalopathy perhaps due to sepsis.
His blood sugar was monitored q.i.d.
Neurology felt that most likely this was anoxic brain injury, and the chance of recovery was very poor as the patient was unresponsive to deep painful stimuli.
Repeat chest films were negative, however, the patient was placed on levofloxacin and Flagyl for 48 hour period until the chest x-ray was definitively clear.
ABG showed excellent oxygenation and ventilation.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient did have mild elevation of the troponins, but CKs were negative although rising in the setting of lateral T-wave changes, and lateral ST depressions.
Renal failure:  He appeared to be at his baseline creatinine of 1.8.
Access:  An A-line was placed for arterial monitoring and pneumoboots were used for DVT prophylaxis.
