Patient had an episode of chest heaviness, which was relieved immediately, and has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and had been described by her son as [**Name2 (NI) **] and diaphoretic.
The patient was sent to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **], where an electrocardiogram was taken showing [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in leads V2 through V4, and oxygen saturation was 79% on room air.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
Patient's hematocrit was 27 and CK was 868 with MB index of 20.1, and troponin of 48.7.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for further care.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 95/65, heart rate 65, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 100% on nonrebreather.
Extremities:  Trace edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.7, hematocrit 24.3, platelets 173,000.
PT 14.1, PTT 144, INR 1.4, sodium 132, potassium 4.5, chloride 96, bicarbonate 22, BUN 33, creatinine 1.4, glucose 209.
CK on admission 868 trending down to 649 with second set, MB 20.1 trending up 22.
Troponin greater than 50.
Calcium 8.7, magnesium 2, phosphate 4.4.
Electrocardiogram taken at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 13049**] showing normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, 3-[**Street Address(2) 5366**] depressions V4 to V5.
Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 **] showing normal sinus rhythm, rate of 64, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions V2 through V4.
Chest x-ray consistent with congestive heart failure.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The impression was that this is a 78-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension presenting with a non ST elevation myocardial infarction with electrocardiogram consistent with likely significant coronary artery disease (left main disease versus critical three vessel disease).
Ischemia:  The patient was initially adamantly refusing cardiac catheterization, so she was placed on a heparin intravenous drip, Plavix, Lopressor, and Cozaar and the goal was optimal medical management.
However, the patient later agreed to go for a cardiac catheterization, which was done two days after admission, which showed 90% stenosis of proximal left circumflex, which was successfully stented, distal occlusion of right coronary artery, which was not intervened on, D1 with 40% stenosis, and left anterior descending with mild disease.
Hemodynamics during cardiac catheterization revealed severely elevated left-sided filling pressures (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 35 mm).
Left ventriculogram showed akinesis of the inferior wall, hypokinesis of the apical, anterolateral, and anterobasal walls with an ejection fraction of 33%, mild mitral regurgitation.
Patient was started on Integrilin and resumed on Plavix, Lopressor, and Cozaar after cardiac catheterization, with doses of Lopressor and Cozaar being titrated as blood pressure tolerated.
The patient's oxygen requirement had decreased to room air prior to cardiac catheterization.
However, during a red blood cell transfusion, which the patient received after cardiac catheterization for a hematocrit of 24, the patient developed shortness of breath despite treatment with Lasix prior to transfusion and developed an increased oxygen requirement of four liters nasal cannula.
A chest x-ray was taken revealing persistent congestive heart failure with cephalization of pulmonary vasculature and a large left-sided pleural effusion.
Renal:   With the patient's history of diabetes and with an elevated creatinine to 1.4 on admission, the patient was given Mucomyst prior to cardiac catheterization for renal protection.
With diuresis for congestive heart failure, the patient's BUN and creatinine were noted to rise from 33/1.4 to 57/1.6, sodium decreased from 132 to 126 (presumably secondary to diureses as well).
As her MCV was low, the patient's anemia was presumably not secondary to her pernicious anemia.
Stool guaiac was negative, as were hemolysis laboratories.
The patient was transfused a total of four units of packed red blood cells during hospital course, and her hematocrit was 33.5 on discharge.
