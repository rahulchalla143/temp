Her oxygen saturations unexpectedly dropped the next day the 80s on room air and she required admission to MICU.
Chest x-ray and CTA showed bilateral pneumonitis and RLL pneumonia but was negative for pulmonary embolus or evidence of CHF.
The patient states she had a stress test within the year that was negative for reversible ischemia.
The patient may have had pulmonary function testing within the year but is unaware of the results.
DP pulses/radial 2+ bilaterally Neuro: A + O x3, CN II-XII grossly intact Skin: No rashes, lesions.
Pertinent Results: OSH chest x-ray [**2184-9-11**]: Diffuse bilateral airspace disease.
OSH CTA [**2184-9-9**]: Severe bilateral alveolar lung disease.

CXR notable for bilateral interstitial alveolar opacities.
CXR much improved [**9-12**], likely due to diuresis of negative 1 liter.
She is now able to maintain her sats on RA though she does get mildly dyspneic with ambulation.
Two abdominal JP drains still remain, draining very minimal serosanguinous fluid.
She had no physical exam findings to suggest chronic liver disease.
