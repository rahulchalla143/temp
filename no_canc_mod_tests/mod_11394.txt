EMS was called and on arrival HR was 20s-30s with EKG showing CHB.
Her BP remained stable at that time.
In the ED VS were T 97.6  HR 83  BP 124/53  RR 20  95% RA.
EKG was without ischemic changes and per EP no anticoagulation was initiated.

Chest x-ray - FINDINGS: Consistent with the given history, a pacer wire has been placed from a right internal jugular approach with the distal tip terminating in the expected location of the right ventricle.
Lung volumes are mildly diminished.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
Echo - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
PA/Lateral chest x-ray - The frontal view of the chest shows interval placement of pacemaker with hardware at the anterior left chest and the tip in the right ventricle.
BP was initially stable, however BP decreased in ED necessitating temporary pacing.
Initially placed temporary pacemaker capturing at rate 70 and BP stable.
Unlikely ischemia causing her presentation as would expect a large RCA infarct to cause this degree of block and this is not evident on EKG and troponins not elevated.
In addition, given new atrial fibrillation patient was started on coumadin on discharge with goal INR [**2-7**].
There was a question as to whether or not there was a history of chest pain prior to syncope which raises question of ischemia, however EKG here without ischemic changes.
Echo demonstrated Suboptimal image quality.
Patient likely needs to be started on ACEinhibitor on discharge for blood pressure control.
Sent anemia labs which demonstrated marginal low B12.
Urine culture however was positive for Acinetobacter.
