An ABG showed pH7.24 pCO2 81 pO2 76 on 100% trach collar.
Repeat ABG was pH 7.24 pCO2 79 pO2 88.
In the MICU, [**2-6**] blood cultures were positive for GPC, with sputum and urine cultures still pending.
He has continued to tolerate the trach mask with high saturations on venous blood gas.
He remains on 50% csm with saturations to the high 90's and a respiratory rate in the teens.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 46 yo M with h/o morbid obesity, OSA, COPD, chronic trach, recent hospitalization in [**4-/2134**] with VAP with cultures + for acinetobacter and pseudomonas who presented to [**Location (un) 620**] on [**6-24**] with O2 sats of 78-82% and somnolence.
Cultures were drawn.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was febrile to 101 and his ABG was notable for pH 7.24 pCO2 81 pO2 76 on 100% trach collar.
Repeat ABG was pH 7.24 pCO2 79 pO2 88.
While in the MICU, his respiratory status improved and his blood cultures were notable for [**2-6**] Enterococcus so his abx were changed to ampicillin and he defervesced (he will need to complete a 14 day course of amp - to be completed on [**2134-7-9**]).
On [**6-30**], he again became tachypneic to RR 40s and O2 sats decreased to 79% on 40% trach mask.
He was changed to 100% trach mask with O2 sats 97-99% but continued tachpnea in 30s so he was transferred to the ICU team for PS o/n.
His blood pressure continued to be elevated.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Congestive heart failure Edema Enterococcus Bacteremia   Discharge Condition: Good.
Blood pressure slightly elevated.
