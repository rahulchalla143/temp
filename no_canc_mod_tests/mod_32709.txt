**FINAL REPORT [**2156-9-24**]** URINE CULTURE (Final [**2156-9-24**]): GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or Lactobacillus sp   Studies: [**2156-9-22**] EKG - Sinus rhythm.
[**2156-9-22**] AP CXR - FINDINGS: Right costophrenic angle excluded from view.
[**2156-9-25**] CHEST (PA & LAT) The questionable opacity in the right upper lobe is no longer seen.
[**2156-9-23**] Transthoracic ECHO - The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Chest Pain: ST-elevations were noted on EKG with complaints of chest pain and patient was sent to catheterization.
Cardiac enzymes were negative at OSH and [**Hospital1 18**].
On leaving the ICU when the patient was asked about her prior chest pain, she stated that she had "heartache" related her difficult social situation.
Hypotension: Patient had recorded SBPs in 90s with EMS, and became hypotensive in cath lab to SBP 70s.
Her BP remained stable on her new regimen, which was continued at discharge.
Urine analysis, urine culture, and blood cultures were sent.
Chest X-ray from admission was concerning for possible pneumonia but may have also been related to aggressive fluid boluses.
Repeat chest x-ray on the floor was indeterminate with recommendation for follow-up.
Chest x-ray on [**2156-9-25**] showed resolution of the previously noted RUL opacity.
Urine culture grew >100,000 gram positive bacteria that likely represents normal flora, however it was decided to treat the patient with a three day course of Bactrim given the high colony count.
Her WBC count remained stably elevated around 11-12K.
Her Lithium level was 0.9 and tox screen was negative.
She will require further psychiatric follow-up following discharge but does not need inpatient psychiatric treatment per the psychiatry team.
Hyponatremia: Patient's serum sodium was 129 on arrival, possibly related to increased free water intake and increased lithium dose.
Her serum sodium gradually increased to normal during her hospital stay when she was put on her prior lithium dose.
Pain Control: She was previously prescribed Tramadol 50mg Q6H PRN pain.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO once a day as needed for constipation: If no bowel movement in 3 days.
Fleet Enema 19-7 gram/118 mL Enema Sig: One (1)  Rectal once a day as needed for constipation.
DuoNeb 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for respiratory distress.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization after an episode of chest pain.
The cardiac catheterization did not show any significant blockages in the arteries of your heart.
Lab tests were also sent which did not show any damage to the muscle of your heart.
Your blood pressure was low during the catheterization, and you were given IV fluids, since you were likely dehydrated.
Your blood pressure improved after receiving the fluids and remained normal afterwards.
STOPPED: Isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur) 30 mg daily DECREASED: Furosemide (Lasix) 20 mg every other day (was daily) DECREASED: Lisinopril 5 mg daily (was 10 mg daily) DECREASED: Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg twice daily (was 100 mg twice daily)  You had a chest X-ray which showed a collection in your lung, but did not have a fever or other signs of infection.
A repeat chest X-ray was performed which did not show any evidence of pneumonia.
You had urine tests during your stay that showed a urinary tract infection.
