Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 75%).
Abnormal signal in the right thalamus has progressed since the MRI from [**2110-10-4**].
CT Torso:  Focal saccular aneurysmal dilatation of the mid descending thoracic aorta measuring 3.2 x 2.3 x 6.0 cm.
CXR [**2110-11-4**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
She was admitted to an OSH briefly on [**9-15**] for five days when a series of tests were performed to identify the source of her AMS.
She received two more CT scans and at least one more MRI and family reports that she was about to get an LP soon.
She had an episode of vomitting and fecal incontinence, and subsequently EMS was called.
- She was seen and staffed by our stroke attending [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1693**] who on his exam, was able to identify skew deviation and small pupils.
She received an MRV and CTV which revealed evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis for which she was initiated on IV heparin therapy (see images below).
A repeat head CT at the time, showed no change in his IPH.
They have been counseled about her extensive rehab course, and are open to various options.
A hypercoagulability panel has been deferred for the outpatient setting; she will remain anticoagulated for at least 6 months.
She did receive a CT torso which did not reveal any source of malignancy.
Her fluid status was kept at net negative and she was diuresed with 40 mg Lasix due to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
Her pressures were controlled with PRN hydralazine for systolic pressures above 160.
- Her Cr increased to 1.8 after she was given an extra 40mg IV lasix on [**11-3**].
PENDING LABS: Blood Cultures x2 [**2110-11-3**] Urine Culture [**2110-11-3**]  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: Patient will need her INR monitored to ensure that it remains between [**3-20**].
She will also need her creatinine monitored to ensure that it continues to trend down with increased oral intake.
She will need her volume status monitored to ensure that she does not get fluid overloaded, and to determine if she needs lasix.
