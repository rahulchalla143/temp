He subsequently sat down and finished his coffee but appeared pale to his wife who checked his pulse and noted it to be irregular and bradycardic with a heart rate of 26.
The pt was BIBA to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] where an EKG demonstrated complete heart block with junctional escape in the 20s to 30s.
He was afebrile with HR of 30 and BP of 160/82, with RR of 10 and SaO2 of 100%.
He received atropine in the [**Location (un) 620**] ED and his rhythm converted to sinus bradycardia.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
CAD: NSTEMI in '[**53**] when he presented with chest pain (positive top but neg CK) s/p cardiac catheterization with POBA of LCx.
The pt had a neg Thallium stress test in '[**60**].

RADIOLOGY  Final Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2163-7-17**] 10:10 PM COMPARISON: [**2163-7-17**].
AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There has been interval placement of a pacing lead that appears to be entering via the IVC.
Otherwise no significant change is seen from prior study with stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
EXERCISE MIBI  [**2163-7-20**]  Reason: CAD S/P PCI, ?
Peak heart rate: 77 Percent max predicted HR: 53% Peak blood pressure: 176/90 Symptoms during exercise: none Reason exercise terminated: stopped at patient request ECG findings: uninterpretable due to left bundle branch block  INTERPRETATION: Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tl-201.
Exercise images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 63%.
IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion study at the level of exercise achieved.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Given symptomatic bradycardia as above, we did not aggressively treat his blood pressure or heart rate given risk for further bradycardia or hypotension.
EKG unrevealing.
Pulsus was 2.
HD stable with SBP 130s, HR 70s.
He underwent a PMIBI which showed a normal myocardial perfusion study at the level of exercise achieved.
Patient was also started on lisinopril for better blood pressure control.
He will follow-up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-31**] weeks for further titration of his anti-hypertensives and will have his electrolytes checked at that time.
You should have your blood pressure checked by your PCP as you may need to have your blood pressure medications adjusted.
