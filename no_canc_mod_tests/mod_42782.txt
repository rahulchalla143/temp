The workup revealed a dilated ascending aorta of 5.2 cm and 3-vessel disease.
Cardiac catheterization performed at [**Hospital6 3872**] on [**2145-12-29**] showed a LAD 80% lesion, a circumflex 80% lesion, a PDA 80% lesion, mild aortic insufficiency, and an ejection fraction of 76%.
An echocardiogram performed on [**2145-9-30**] showed an EF of 60%, an aortic root of 4.2 cm, mild AI, and mild MR.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was 5 feet 11 inches, 152 pounds, his pulse was regular at 60, blood pressure on the right was 120/80, on the left 118/78.
His heart was regular in rate and rhythm with a loud S2 and a grade [**11-25**] to 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
He had 2+ bilateral femoral, DP, PT, and radial pulses.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 5.8, hematocrit of 44.2, and platelet count of 245,000.
PT of 13.4, PTT of 33.1, and INR of 1.1.
Sodium of 140, K of 4.1, chloride of 99, bicarbonate of 33, BUN of 21, creatinine of 1.0, with a blood sugar of 74.
His urinalysis was negative.
ALT of 25, AST of 25, alkaline phosphatase of 66, amylase of 77, total bilirubin of 0.7, total protein of 7.0, albumin of 4.5, globulin of 2.5, and HBA1C of 5.2%.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  Preoperative EKG revealed a sinus bradycardia at 51 with an intraventricular conduction delay, and left axis deviation, and a question of an old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Preoperative chest x-ray revealed evidence of emphysema with no pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
In the cardiothoracic ICU that evening he was quickly weaned off his Levophed as his SBPs were rising into the 130s, and nitroglycerin and Nipride were added in and titrated up to keep his systolic blood pressure below 110.
He also received 4 units of FFP and 2 packs of platelets from anesthesia due to an INR of 2.5, and when he came out of the OR he received an additional 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and 2 units of packed cells for a hematocrit of 23.8.
He was in a sinus rhythm at 72 with a blood pressure of 119/73.
Postoperative laboratories showed a BUN of 17, a creatinine of 1.0, a K of 4.6, a hematocrit of 29 (after 2 units of packed red blood cells).
His heart rate was 77.
His creatinine rose only slightly to 1.2.
His hematocrit remained stable at 28.9.
On the day of discharge his blood pressure was 116/64, in sinus rhythm at 77, saturating 94 percent on room air.
