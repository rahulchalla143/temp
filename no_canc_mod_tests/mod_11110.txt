Mother is a 27 year old gravida III, para II, now III, woman with prenatal screens that included blood type A positive, antibody screen negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune and group B streptococcus negative.

A prenatal magnetic resonance scan suggested Dandy Walker variant.
A postnatal magnetic resonance scan reveals agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia, enlarged cisterna magna.
Chromosomes were sent and were normal 46XX.
Additional screening included normal spinal films, normal renal scans, and normal eye exam.
Sensory - Audiology hearing screening was performed with automated auditory brainstem response and passed both ears.
