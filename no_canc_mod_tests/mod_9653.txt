PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.7.
Pulse 90.
Respirations 16.
Blood pressure 140/90.
HEENT examination is unremarkable.
Pulse examination shows intact carotids bilaterally.
The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial on the right have dopplerable signal.
Chest examination lungs are clear to auscultation.

He underwent arteriogram on [**2147-1-3**], which demonstrated normal aorta, iliac without significant disease on the left, mild diffuse disease of the superficial femoral artery and PFA.
Pulmonary consult was placed prior to surgery to assess pulmonary risks with chest x-ray findings of left lower lobe pneumonia.
The Prandin was discontinued and his Lantus insulin was increased to 6 to 8 units at h.s.
and sliding scale premeals and at supper time were written for.
The patient's admitting sodium was 127, which was stabilized, but he was covered perioperatively with Dexamethasone 4 mg pre 2 mg post surgical procedure.
He underwent an intraoperative TE, which showed global right ventricular and left ventricular hypokinesis, moderate MR to severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 13223**].
The patient's total CK peaked at 271 and defervesced in the next 48 hours to 123.
His MB fractions were flat and were not done, but his troponin levels peaked at 45 and defervesced 48 hours later to 20.4.
Their recommendations were to diurese to keep the pulmonary wedge pressure less then equal to 18.
Postoperative hematocrit was 37.2, BUN 47, creatinine 1.4, K 4.2.
He maintained his hematocrit above 30.
His blood gas was 7.4, 42, 83, 27 and 0.
Hematocrit remained stable at 36.3 after transfusion.
He will require an echocardiogram in three months.
Echocardiogram was done on [**1-10**], which demonstrated ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.
Basal anteroseptal, which is hypokinetic.
Basal inferior, which is akinetic.
Basal infralateral, which is akinetic.
Slugrocortisone acetate 0.1 mg b.i.d., Darvocet N 100 one q 6 hours prn for pain, acetominophen 325 to 650 mg q 4 to 6 hours prn for pain, aspirin 325 mg q.d., Warfarin dose will be adjusted and maintain an INR between 2.5 and 3.5.
