CTA at OSH showed SAH and L ACA aneurysm.
Patient was then taken to angiogram where 3 coils were placed.
SBP was liberalized and cardiac enzymes and ECHO were ordered to evaluate for sympathetic surge.
EF > 55% on ECHO.
On [**3-12**], spiked fever, cultures sent.
His exam has remained stable.
CSF was sent in preperation for the procedure which remained negative.
Post-op head CT was stable with no hemorrhage and cath tip placement in the L lateral ventricle.
On [**3-22**], his exam was improved as he appeared clearer.
A head CT was done in preparation for discharge to once again confirm placement of his shunt catheter.
The CT head was stable.
