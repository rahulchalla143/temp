Head CT [**2171-6-20**]: No change in the appearance of hemrrhagic parechymal contusions, mass effect and diffuse cerebral edema.
Head CT [**2171-6-20**]: No change in the appearance of hemrrhagic parechymal contusions, mass effect and diffuse cerebral edema.
Head CT [**2171-6-21**]: No significant change in appearance of bifrontal and left temporal hemorrhagic contusions, with surrounding mass effect and diffuse cerebral edema.
Head CT [**2171-6-23**]: Allowing for the differences in the slice selection, no significant change in appearance of bifrontal and left temporal hemorrhagic contusions with surrounding mass effect and diffuse edema.

A [**Last Name (un) 8745**] bolt was placed on [**6-20**] with ICP's in [**3-28**] range.
He had a repeat head CT which showed progression of cerebral hemorrhage/contusions.
His neuro exam remained stable and slowly improved up to the time of discharge.
A PT evaluation recommended further treatment at a rehab facility.
A speech and swallow evaluation recommended continued tube feeds because of aspiration risks from altered mental status.
Neuro exam prior to discharge: Patient was alert and awake, nonverbal.
