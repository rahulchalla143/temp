CARDIAC HISTORY: In [**2135-9-3**], per the patient's wife report, the patient had a stent placed to the LAD and two other vessels and did well on plavix, aspirin and coreg with an EF of 45%.
On [**2136-12-7**] after episode of CP, the patient was admitted to OSH with non- Q wave MI and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed 70% LAD instent stenosis, 70-80% instent stenosis at the RCA and the LCx had 90% stenosis and an aortic valve area of 0.9cm.
he was transferred to [**Hospital 100**] rehab from OSH for an NSTEMI, [**Hospital 1291**] and CABG complicated by multiple issues described below.
-CABG:  LIMA to LAD saphenous graft sequential to an OM1 and OM2 and [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital3 1291**] [**12-12**] -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS:  DES to LAD in [**2136**], prior  stent to RCA and LAD -PACING/ICD:  none 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Chronic systolic dysfunction (EF 30%) ESRD on HD Chronic left-sided pleural effusion Prior GI bleed - ?rectal ulcer Hyperlipidemia IDDM chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin Stoke with no residual neurologic deficits Hypothyroid AS s/p [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] [**Hospital3 **] Hyperparathyroidism Right AV fistula Rectal Ulcers: CMV positive Blood cultures during his prior hospitalization grew gram negative rods speciated to Aeromonas hydrophilia for which he was treated with 6 weeks of ciprofloxacin last day of therapy [**2137-2-5**].
During this time he developed lower GI bleed, colonscopy revealed rectal uclers which were cauterizated and biospy was CMV positive.
NECK: Supple with JVP at mandible.

CHEST XRAY [**2137-2-28**] IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema.
TTE [**2137-2-28**] The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with regional variation (lateral wall relatively preserved).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of 10 Janaury [**2137**], the tricuspid regurgitation appears reduced, but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive comparison.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2137-2-28**] 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided filling pressure with a mean PCWP of 20 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with a PA pressure of 60/28 mmHg.
Cardiac output was mildly depressed at 4.76 L/min with an index of 2.61 L/min/m2.
CT ABD/PELVIS: [**2137-3-2**] 1.
TTE [**2137-3-4**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-2-28**], the findings are similar (estimated PASP may be slightly lower).

Still holding all cardiac meds to allow BP for HD.
Swan could not be floated but had RHC during HD cath placement which showed wedge of 20.
Echo on [**2-28**] showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with regional variation (lateral wall relatively preserved).
ANEMIA: Patient with Hct 21 on admission, has a history of transfusion-dependent anemia with GI sources, including rectal ulcers.
C diff sent off as patient was being treated at rehab facility with PO vanco and flagyl.
CMV VL negative and cdiff PCR negative.
Hct now 28.
?s in pairs & clusters grew from blood cx from femoral line and art line on HD 6 which ultimately speciated to staph aureus.
After patient was made CMO, vancomycin resistent enterococcus was positive in a second set of blood cultures from HD 8.
C diff negative toxin two times, and PCR negative.
No evidence of colitis on CT scan.
Coumadin was restarted on [**3-18**] at 2mg daily and INR should be checked on [**3-20**].
Needs INR on [**2137-3-20**] with goal 2.0-3.0. .
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush Mid-line, non-heparin dependent:    Flush with 10 mL Normal Saline daily and PRN per lumen.
12. heparin (porcine)-0.45% NaCl 25,000 unit/250 mL Parenteral Solution Sig: as per weight based heparin protocol units Intravenous continuous: D/C when INR > 2.0.
13. warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day: Check INR on Thursday [**2137-3-21**] and adjust dose accordingly.
It was difficult to do dialysis because your blood pressure was very low and you needed medicines to help keep your blood pressure up.
Start Heparin drip to prevent blood clots.
