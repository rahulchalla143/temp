Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with HTN, diastolic CHF, asthma, admitted to OSH with GNR bacteremia with cholesytitis, cholangitis, and gallstone pancreatitis, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] following unsuccessful ERCP complicated by A. fib with RVR.

Post surgery patient's WBC was within normal range, patient was afebrile.
Given that LFTs were consistent with an obstructive picture, an ERCP was performed on [**2114-4-17**].
WBC was normal.
