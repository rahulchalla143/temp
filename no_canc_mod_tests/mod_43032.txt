The patient was advised to undergo a Persantine MIBI study at [**Hospital6 1597**]; however, the scheduled study had to be cancelled secondary to the patient's increased blood pressure.
The patient was subsequently referred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation and was admitted to the Cardiac Medicine Service on [**2126-3-26**] for further evaluation and management.
An echocardiogram obtained on [**2126-3-27**], demonstrated evidence of inducible ischemia; subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease with 90% occlusion of the proximal LAD, 80% midsegment occlusion of the left circumflex, and 80-90% occlusion of the right coronary artery.
The cardiac catheterization additionally demonstrated mild to moderate diastolic biventricular dysfunction.
The patient's ejection fraction was noted to be approximately 51% with no evidence of focal regional wall abnormalities.
The patient's pericardium was left open; intraoperative lines placed included an arterial line and a Swan-Ganz catheter; two ventricular wires and one atrial and one ground wire were placed; both mediastinal and left pleural tubes were placed.
The patient was subsequently transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated for further evaluation and management.
On transfer, the patient's mean arterial pressure was 74, CVP 10, PAD 19, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] 23.
On postoperative day number six, the patient complained of a diffuse itching; physical examination demonstrated a mild papular dry rash effecting the patient's trunk.
The patient was subsequently trained in the use of an Albuterol inhaler following clear x-ray studies demonstrating no evidence of pulmonary infiltrate.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his primary care provider within one to two weeks following discharge for potential outpatient MRA study to rule out renovascular hypertension.
