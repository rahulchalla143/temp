Vital signs on transfer from nursing home were: T 98.8 BP 118/76, HR 112, RR 24, O2 sat 88% on 2L.
Exam was notable for complete disorientation (AAOx0), diaphoretic, opens eyes and responds to voice and name, guiaic negative brown stool, III-IV SEM heard throughout precordium, and a CBI catheter.
Urinalysis showed many WBCs, large leuk esterase with significant amount of bacteriuria and CXR showed concern for a RML/RLL infiltrate.
BP improved to 100-120s/60s and mental status very slightly improved.
Urine output hard to quantify given CBI.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS: HR 70 BP 106/45 RR 22 SpO2 97%/RA.

- Last ECHO ([**2135-5-9**]), LVEF 60 %, moderate AS - history of vertebral body fracture - BPH - history of MRSA pneumonia - C. difficile colitis   Social History: Unable to obtain from the patient.

MICROBIOLOGY:  Micro - c diff negative, urine culture from admission contaminated, blood cultures from admission no growth to date.
ECHO [**4-3**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-5-9**], the degree of AS is now slightly more severe (mean gradient now 61 mmHg vs 38 mmHg on prior) with more hyperdynamic LV systolic function.

Aspiration PNA may also have played a role given his RML/RLL infiltrates on CXR and his poor mental status with high risk for aspiration.
He was mildly hypotensive on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with SBP in the 80s on no pressors.
Urine culture was negative, and therefore cause of symptoms presumed due to aspiration pneumonia.
His baseline MS is A&Ox1 to self, thought to be from vascular dementia.
We held his seroquel and trazodone initially, but continued Celexa.
His underlying infection/sepsis may be acutely lowering his WBC, although he has evidence of leukopenia prior to his presentation for sepsis.
The transition off [**Month/Day (2) **] was continued, after discussion with his neurologist, and the [**Month/Day (2) 13401**] was decreased from 500 mg twice daily to 250/500.
His cardiac exam is consistent with a decreased S2, suggestive of critical AS.
Repeat TTE showed progression of his aortic stenosis, to severe.
His rehab states that he has been on this for at least a year and plan to continue it indefinitely.
Has had negative cystoscopy and CT urogram with no clear cause for his hematuria.
Blood cultures pending at discharge.
