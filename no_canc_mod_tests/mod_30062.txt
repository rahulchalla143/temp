[**6-12**] CTA: Compared to the exam of [**2167-6-11**], no significant change in the appearance of the aortic intramural hematoma.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
MRI C-SPINE ([**6-18**]) 1.
MRI T-SPINE ([**6-18**]) No evidence of an epidural abscess   Brief Hospital Course: 1) AORTIC DISSECTION: Intramural aortic hematoma seen on CT scan in ED.

He had an extensive work-up including MRI spine (negative for epidural abscess), TTE (negative for vegetation), blood cultures (negative), urine cultures (negative), PPD (negative), Hepatitis panel, HIV test (negative).
4) ANEMIA: Patient's HCT was in low thirties.
Work-up revealed low iron, normal TIBC, and high ferritin, as well as a borderline low B12 level.
The MRI of the L-spine commented on a diffusely abnormal signal pattern from the bone marrow.
You should check your blood pressure daily and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] if it is higher than 140/90 or lower than 90/50.
