The hepatology service was aware of the patient's presence in the hospital and followed the patient throughout hospitalization.The patient underwent an echocardiogram to rule out septic foci of the heart valves that might be seeding his lungs with septic foci.
His sputum cultures from [**8-14**] grew COAG positive staph, gram positive cocci and gram positive rods.
However, CT findings and the patient's clinical status deteriorated leading to transfer back to the ICU.
The thoracic and transplant surgery teams did feel the patient would be able to tolerate a lung biopsy at that time.
Specifically, the CT chest from [**8-19**] demonstrated marked progression of innumerable bilateral lung opacities involving all lobes with associated ground glass opacity and cavitation.
The patient required pressor support to maintain his blood pressure, his respiratory status slowly deteriorated until his peak airway pressure were in the mmHg range.
The patient's cell lines were repleted with Neupogen and multiple blood products to support his condition.
The patient's antibiotics were closely followed and dosed in order to cover positive cultures per blood, sputum and urine.
