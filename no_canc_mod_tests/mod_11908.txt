CXR ([**2124-6-4**]): Right lower lobe pneumonia and probable left lower lobe pneumonia.
RUE US ([**2124-6-7**]): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis involving the right upper extremity.
EKG ([**2124-6-4**]): Sinus rhythm.
GIB: GI was consulted and took the patient for EGD which showed 2 duodenal ulcers.
She received 4 units pRBC in first 24 hours with appropriate increase in her hct from 17 --> 26.
Iron studies were consistent with AOCD despite her history of iron deficiency anemia.
An h.pylori antibody was sent which was positive; eradication therapy was begun on [**6-11**].
She had an additional drop in her hematocrit 1 day after her EGD, and she was transfused an additional 2u pRBC.
She was taken for another EGD on [**6-8**] which showed stable non-bleeding duodenal ulcer.
Thereafter her hematocrit was stable with a discharge value of 25.3%  2.
CXR revealed RLL infiltrate which was suspicious for a pneumonia.
She appeared to have fairly advanced dementia and was not oriented to her surroundings or to time.
A head CT showed a chronic SDH vs. hygroma with no active issue.
Urine output remained >600cc/day, but the patient needed reminders to continue taking PO.
