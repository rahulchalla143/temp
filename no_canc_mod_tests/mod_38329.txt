Poor cardiac output/mixed venous results warranted an echocardiogram which showed the heart to be underfilled and volume was administered.
On [**10-2**] HIT panel was sent secondary to postoperative thrombocytopenia, which resulted negative.
She remained in the CVICU until POD 8 when she was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring and increased physical activity.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
