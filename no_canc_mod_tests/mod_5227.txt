A right-sided electrocardiogram showed no changes in V4.
His initial creatine kinase at [**Hospital6 3105**] was 198 and then increased to a peak of 2100 and then began trending down.
His troponin was 155.
Due to his recurrent angina, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further workup and management.

Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to light.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed regular, bradycardic.

Lipid panel at [**Hospital6 3105**] was as follows:  Total cholesterol of 192, LDL of 115, HDL of 38.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization the next day which revealed a middle left circumflex 90% lesion which was stented, and third obtuse marginal stenosis which received angioplasty.
A left ventriculography showed an ejection fraction of 60% and mild inferior hypokinesis.
The patient was maintained on Integrilin status post catheterization; however, this was prematurely discontinued due to a platelet count of 70 which was later discovered to be a laboratory error.
PUMP:  The patient with no evidence of failure on examination on admission.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained after catheterization which showed an ejection fraction of 50% and posterobasal hypokinesis.
Iron panel was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease picture.
