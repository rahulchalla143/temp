Relevant details of his hospital course are described by systems below:  Neurological - Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 37725**] suffered multiple intracranial hemorrhages and subarachnoid bleed as evident on computerized tomography scans which were repeated serially through his hospital course.
His hemorrhages evolved over the first day and then were stable throughout the course.
His cervical spine was cleared with an magnetic resonance imaging scan after which the collar was taken off.
Initially his blood pressure was controlled as per guidelines established by Neurosurgery.
He has been on this dose for several weeks and has a stable blood pressure and heartrate without any signs of arrhythmia.
His hematocrit is stable at 30 on discharge.
One of the cultures through an arterial line during his course had an enterococcus resistant to Vancomycin which was treated with linezolid.
His white count at discharge is coming down and is at 13.
During his aspiration pneumonia course his white count maxed at about approximately 25.
Prophylaxis - Once cleared by Neurosurgery, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 37725**] was placed on heparin subcutaneous prophylaxis.
