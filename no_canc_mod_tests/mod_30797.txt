She was monitored, her cardiac enzymes were wnl at the time.
Her symptoms did not seem to be associated with the bradycardia, as they persisted with a normal HR, and a PM was not thought to be necessary.
VS on admission (66 18 119/41).
Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, LVH, poor R-wave progession, question of an old anteroseptal infarct and lateral T-wave inversions in I, avL and V5 and V6.
Her CE on admission: CPK - 585, CPK-MB - 40.9, troponin - 5.09.
BNP - 22,864.
She was not thought to need an urgent cath, and was treated with a heparin gtt, low dose BB, Repeat enzymes were (CPK - 490, 449, troponins 4.68, 4.72, CK-MB - 27.9, 24.1).
Her abdominal pain was evaluated by CT which showed a distended gb as the only pathology with subsequent RUQ US showing a small amount of gb sludge, moderately distended gb, but no pericholecystic fluid, with mild dilatation of the CBD to 8mm.
A stat CT abd w/o contrast was ordered [**12-29**] to poor renal function, and surgery was consulted.
CT did not reveal any obvious cause for her pain.

NECK: Supple with JVP of 7cm.
CARDIAC: S1 S2, [**1-2**] pan-systolic murmur, heard best at left 5th intercostal space LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Posterior exam was not performed [**12-29**] patient discomfort, anteriorly decreased breath sounds at the right lung base.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2167-3-6**], the extent of regional LV systolic dysfunction has increased.
# ARF: On admission patient c/o abdominal pain, constipation, rising lactate 1.5 to 1.8, exam concerning for mesenteric ischemia.
On [**8-7**] and [**8-10**] patient underwent cardiac catheterization with a deterioration in creatine.
She underwent further HD and also received 1 unit PRBCs on [**8-11**], with improvement in her urine output.
On [**7-27**] echo showed reduced EF EF 30-35% and cardiac enzyme peak to troponin 5.07.
She underwent cath on [**2167-8-7**] which showed 3 vessel disease:  LMCA had a 40% ostial lesion, LAD 99% stenosis in mid-portion, LCX had a 90% proximal stenosis, RCA heavily calcified vessel with a proximal 95% stenosis and a distal 80% stenosis.
She was evaluated by CT [**Doctor First Name **] [**8-8**] and was not considered a surgical candidate due to aortic calcifications.
She then underwent repeat cath [**2167-8-10**] during which Promus stents were placed in the distal and proximal RCA lesions, and the mid LAD stenosis was ballooned but a stent could not be passed.
CT scan, initially without, and then with, contrast was performed.
Given the severity of her pain and clinical picture, it was felt that the study was warranted.
Her CT abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of mesenteric ischemia and the patient's abdominal pain seemed to resolve progressively without intervention.
# CHF: Baseline diastolic heart failure with EF 60% on 4/[**2166**].
Echo [**7-24**] showed EF 40-45%, and echo [**7-27**] showed EF 30-35%.
There was also marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 74, and 1+ MR.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On admission she had an INR of 5.1 and received Vitamin K and warfarin was held.
# UTI: Microscopic hematuria with 6-10WBC and many bacteria were seen on urinalysis on [**8-2**].
Na on discharge was 127. .
TSH was within normal limits.
A work up revealed that you had a heart attack, for which you underwent cardiac catheterization and received stents to the vessels of your heart.
Because of your poor heart function and the contrast you received when getting CT scan and catheterization, your kidneys failed.
Fluid Restriction to less than 1L.
