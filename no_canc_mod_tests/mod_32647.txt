She subsequently became pulseless and CPR was initiated at 9:40pm.
Initial EKG asystole.
In the Emergency Department she experienced further bradycardia, and decompensaated into PEA and then asystole.
After 7 mintues of CPR code was almost called, but got 5mg epinephrine with resultant regain of pulse with a wide complex idioventricular rhythym and BP 80/25.
She got a CT scan which demonstrated bilateral posterior airspace consolidations consistent with massive aspiration, no pulmonary emobli allthough evaluation of subsegmental bronchi was sub-optimal.
CT head was normal with no bleed, edema, or mass effect.
A urine tox was posative for cocaine.
She came to the ICU on tripple pressors (Dopamine, dobuatmine, and levophed) with a BP 112/44 and HR sinus tachycardia 112 and sating 86% on AC Tv 500, 100% fio2, rr14, 5 PEEP.

Evaluation for subsegmental emboli is limited due to contrast bolus and airspace consolidation.
[**2183-1-25**] CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial pathology including hemorrhage or mass effect.
Her cardiopulmonary arrest was thought related to her recent cocaine use, either with cocaine-induced seizure, hypoxia, or primary arrhythmia.
Given concern over the large amount of aspirated material in her lungs, a bronchoscopy was performed on [**1-27**] to evaluate for retained solid material; nothing was seen.
Her vent setting were weaned to pressure support and her pressors were off within hours of arrival to the ICU.
Her creatinine on arrival was 1.1 which rose to 1.5 after the arrest, thought secondary to prerenal azotemia; her creatinine returned to [**Location 213**] prior to discharge, along with her transaminitis which was thought secondary to shock liver.
