CXR [**10-20**] 1.
Echo [**10-21**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-9-27**], no vegetations are seen.
CT Scan [**2138-10-22**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized thorax, there is a small left pleural effusion and associated relaxation atelectasis.
Fluid is seen adjacent to the descending colon towards the sigmoid (series 2, image 51; series 300B, image 22).
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A left femoral venous central line is seen with tip terminating in the right atrium.
A larger locules of gas is seen abutting a segment of small bowel centrally suggestive of a focus of perforation.
Echocardiogram showed no masses or vegetations, though did show her EF was now 20%, similar to 25% from most recent other echocardiogram.
Serial KUBs became positive for free air, and CT scan of the abdomen confirmed viscous perforation.
She was continued on antibiotics, and also on norepinephrine that had been started the evening of the ct findings.
Dialysis was stopped, and on [**2118-10-27**] she had a cardiac arrest, and was declared dead at 1625 without resuscitation efforts.
