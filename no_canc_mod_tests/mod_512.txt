Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2187-11-14**] CT head: IMPRESSION: 1.
There she was initially dx'd with dehydration, ARF and UTI but then found to have ALT of 25,370 and of AST 11,490, total bili of 2.0, INR of 4.0, Cr of 3.0.
She was given home doses of simvastatin and SSRIs, but then found to have ALT of 25,370 and of AST 11,490, total bili of 2.0, INR of 4.0, Cr of 3.0.
Her liver function was notable for transaminases with an ALT and AST of 9500 and 17,500 respectively and worsening hyperbilirubinemia.
This was evidenced by progressive ability to metabolize her lactate, stabilization of her blood sugars, and autocorrection of her coagulopathy.
During her stay in the SICU, she required respiratory ventilation, vasopressors for hypotension and intracranial pressure monitoring.
The patient initially had blood pressure support with the use of vasopressors in order to minimize her intravascular volume which was thought to exacerbate her cerebral edema.
This was followed serially with CT scans and there was no progression of the bleeding.
Pan cultures were negative.
Stable on MRI [**2187-11-18**].
Amylase and Lipase are trending down so continuing TF.
However, pt currently afebrile with WBC 11.1. .
