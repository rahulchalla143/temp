CT abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Presented with creatinine of 11.6.
Renal u/s and FeNa of 11.2% consistent with parenchymal disease.
Nonetheless, checked C3, C4, and dsDNA to rule out lupus flare and they only showed low C3 and were otherwise normal.
A tunneled line was placed and she was dialyzed for 2 days, discharged for placement of an AVF the following day, followed by the 3rd day of dialysis.
CT prelim read suggested vasculitis in jejunal loops of bowel, possibly due to SLE.
Pt reported improvement in epigastric pain and repeat guaiac was negative on HD2.
GI was consulted and recommended enteroscopy which did not reveal any jejunal pathology.
CXR did not suggest pneumonia.
Sputum sample obtained and throat swab sent for culture with growth of likely contaminant.
No evidence of infection on exam and pain resolved.
Presented with hct of 18.5, likely a contributor to her fatigue symptoms.
She also has renal failure which was likely contributing to poor RBC production.
Iron studies show anemia of chronic disease.
She received 2 units PRBC and her Hct stabilized near 28.
