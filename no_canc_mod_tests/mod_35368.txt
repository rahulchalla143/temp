CT head ([**2102-6-13**]): No evidence of hemorrhage.
However, given the lack of prior studies and the appearance of white matter changes in the right frontal [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] acute component of abnormality cannot be exlcuded.
ECHO [**2102-6-16**]: severe pulmonary hypertension; moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation; dilated, hypocontractile right ventricle .

Altered mental status: The patient intially presented with altered mental status of unknown etiology with a Ddx of acute CVA or intracranial hemorrhage, infection, post-ictal state, opioid toxicity, hypercarbia, or pulmonary embolism.
The patient had a CTA with contrast that r/o a PE.
A CT of the head revealed old infarcts, however, new infarcts could not be excluded.
Neurology consulted on the patient and suggested a MRI given difficulty in recognizing acute infarct on CT, however, patient cannot get an MRI due to her pacemaker.
A U/A revealed a UTI and a urine culture revealed pan-sensitive Klebsiella.
A RPR, TSH, B12 and folate were all within normal range.
Acute diastolic heart failure/pleural effusion: The patient had a TTE showing LVEF=65=70% with no LVH.
While in the the ICU, the patient developed an acute episode of respiratory distress and her BNP was elevated ~16,000 (on admission~3000).
Initially, there was a possibly of PE, but CTA with contrast ruled out any PE.
A CT of the chest revealed atelectasis of the RLL which can be contributing to her hypoxia.
Cultures revealed pan-sensitive Klebsiella and pt completed 10 day course of ciprofloxacin with no growth seen on subsequent urine cultures.
INR at discharge was 1.2 and coumadin restarted with goal INR [**12-20**].
Will need regular labs drawn and coumadin dosages titrated at nursing home.
Coumadin restarted, will require regular follow up lab draws at nursing home to assess INR for coumadin management.
Goal INR of [**12-20**].
Cr at discharge was 1.5. .
A previous Echo from an admission at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**12-26**] showed the absence of pulmonary hypertension.
Coumadin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Please check INR and dose coumadin to reach INR goal [**12-20**].
Fleet Enema 19-7 gram/118 mL Enema Sig: One (1) enema Rectal PRN as needed for constipation.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw labs to check PT, INR twice a week and dose coumadin accordingly for goal INR of [**12-20**].
Patient can be wean as tolerated for goal of O2 saturation of 86-92% 16.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) mL Injection three times a day: Stop 3 days after reaching INR goal [**12-20**].
When you came to the [**Hospital1 18**], imaging was done of your head and chest which showed you did not have a head bleed or pulmonary embolism.

Please draw labs to check for INR twice a week and dose coumadin accordingly for goal INR of [**12-20**].
Once patient is therapeutic on coumadin, INR checks can be done once a week.
Her target oxygen saturation goal on supplemental oxygen is 86-92%.
