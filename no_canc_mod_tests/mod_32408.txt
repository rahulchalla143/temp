IMAGING: CTA head/neck (OSH) ([**11-8**]): 1.
MRI brain (OSH) ([**11-8**]): subtle restricted diffusion in the right basal ganglia and insula.
CXR (OSH) ([**11-8**]): Impression:  Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
CT Head/CTP ([**11-8**]): IMPRESSION: Increase in mean transit time throughout the entire territory of the right MCA.
TTE ([**11-9**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
MRI/MRA Head ([**11-9**]): IMPRESSION: Area of infarct of the right putamen and globus pallidus and subsequent hemorrhagic transformation.
ECG ([**11-14**]): Atrial flutter with 2:1 block at a rate of 154.
Abdominal X-ray ([**11-16**]):  IMPRESSION: No evidence of ileus or bowel obstruction.
CXR AP ([**11-16**]): As compared to the prior radiograph, there has been improved aeration in the lung bases with near resolution of atelectasis.
CT Head ([**11-19**]): IMPRESSION: Hemorrhagic conversion of known right basal ganglia infarct is stable in size and appearance from previous examination from [**2150-11-11**].
CTA head/neck (OSH) showed diminished perfusion in the right MCA territory with cutoff of the right MCA M1 segment.
MRI brain showed subtle restricted diffusion in the right basal ganglia and insula.
At [**Hospital1 18**], CTP showed increase in mean transit time throughout the entire territory of the right MCA, decrease in blood volume and blood flow within the right putamen and globus pallidus consistent with infarct in this area.
TTE showed LVEF >60%, no ASD or PFO, moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation.
Repeat MRI/A brain showed area of infarct of the right putamen and globus pallidus and subsequent hemorrhagic transformation, small amount of surrounding edema with mass effect on the right lateral ventricle without significant shift of midline structures.
Repeat Head CTs showed stable size and appearance of the hemorrhagic transformation.
She should have INRs checked frequently until INR is at the goal of 2.0-3.0.
Hyperlipidemia/Hypertriglyceridemia: FLP: Chol 127, TG 606, HDL 39, LDL 55.
Blood culture showed no growth.
Urine culture showed Staph aureus coag +, and sputum cx showed 4+ MSSA, 2+ GNRs.
Repeat urine culture showed no growth.
Stool culture was negative for C. diff, but fecal and campylobacter cultures were pending at the time of discharge.
WBC was 16.2 at the time of discharge.
Outpatient Lab Work Check INR daily until is therapeutic (goal [**2-15**]) 10.
Outpatient Lab Work You should have a repeat fasting lipid panel (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL) checked in 6 weeks on [**2150-12-28**].
You received IV tPA, and when transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] underwent a cerebral angiography for IA tPA and clot retrieval.
You were started on Coumadin 3 mg daily, and should have your INR checked daily until you reach your goal INR [**2-15**].
