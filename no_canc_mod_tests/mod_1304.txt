Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor native endocardial border definition.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 1 iv injection of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline at rest.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-7-25**], echo contrast was used on the current study.
However, echo contrast was not used on the prior.
He was found to have EKG changes and a troponin elevation consistent with an ST elevation myocardial infarction.
He was started on a heparin infusion and had a cardiac catheterization the next day which showed diffuse three vessel disease.
His hemoglobin A1C was 10.7 and he was poorly controlled in-house, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted.
He weaned from his high dose insulin infusion with lantus and an aggresive sliding scale [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations.
