Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation x 2  History of Present Illness: This is a pleasant 83 year-old woman with history of htn, hypothyroidism, parox afib, hip fracture 4 years ago and s/p b/l mastectomy for breast cancer transferred from [**Hospital3 12594**] after fracturing her left humerus on [**9-28**] s/p ORIF, anemia-guiaic positive requiring transfusion-neg egd-(esophagitis and gastroparesis), no colonoscopy done due to instability, with d/c to rehab on [**10-3**], then re-admitted [**10-4**] with resp distress, initially thought [**3-6**] pneumonia, placed on broad spectrum abx, spiked fever on [**10-5**], ICU stay without intubation, but [**3-6**] high o2 requirement serial CT's done and revealed interstitial fibrosis and b/l ground glass opacities.
Because of CT findings, diff expanded to possible amio toxicity (for afib on for years w/o previous problems), pulm fibrosis, alv proteionisis, fat embolism and steroids were started.
ABG shows 7.48/34/64.
Pertinent Results: wbc 33.3 when last checked .
IMAGING: Chest CT [**2120-10-13**]: ground glass opacities with upper lobe predominance, septal thickening, associated pleural effusions, small mediastinal lymphadenopathy, dilated esophagus, cardiomegaly .
CTA [**2120-10-16**]: 1.
Chest CT [**2120-10-24**]: 1.
Increased CT attenuation of the liver could be due to amiodarone toxicity given that the patient had been on amiodarone.
CXR [**2120-11-12**]: Tip of the NG tube is in the stomach.
ECHO [**2120-10-16**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
MICROBIOLOGY: c diff neg x 3, toxin B: pending VRE UTI by cx [**2120-11-7**] [**2120-11-2**]: mod MRSA in sputum pl fld [**2120-10-26**]: rare MRSA BAL [**10-14**] and [**2120-10-25**]: HSV 1, 10-100K MRSA   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: This is an 83 year-old woman with history of htn, hypothyroidism, paf who suffered humeral fracture on [**9-28**] s/p ORIF at [**Hospital6 19155**] which failed.
Patient was sent to rehab [**10-3**] but returned the following day with hypoxic respiratory failure and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
- started acyclovir 400mg tid on [**2120-10-19**] for HSV 1 cultured from lungs.
CT w/ground glass opacity.
Per path, hemosiderin and fat laden macrophages have ddx = alveolar hemorrhage; Wegeners; GBM, also can be fat emboli.
CXR consistent with aspiration vs derecruitment.
- Chest CT showed worsening of parenchyma but also bilateral effusions.
Sats 100% with 40% fio2.
- PTX resolved and CT d/c - subsequent sputum cx grew out MRSA, patient tx w/ course of vancomycin and was again ready for extubation - d/w patient and family led to decision to change code status to DNR/DNI - following extubation, patient again began to fail, presumably due to CHF and likely aspiration - d/w family and patient led to decision to change plan of care to CMO - patient started on morphine gtt and was stable o/n off lasix gtt w/ permissive po's - in the AM, family requested d/c 100% NRB and patient expired w/in approximately 15 minutes from respiratory arrest .
# Anemia: - OSH EGD [**10-1**] showed esophagitis - PPI increased to [**Hospital1 **] when patient developed black stools - colonoscopy deferred given respiratory status and relatively stable hct - patient continued to have guiac positive and occasionally black stools and was supported w/ transfusions until made CMO .
# depression/anxiety: continue paxil (dose decreased while on linezolid to decrease r/o serotonin syndrome) # h/o breast cancer: continue tamoxifen # hypothyrodism: continue synthroid.
