As the patient developed acute renal failure during her hospitalization, the workup for AVR was postponed, specifically cardiac catheterization.
The patient was discharged on oral diuretics in an attempt to regain renal function prior to restarting evaluation for AVR.
The family reports that her chest pain was left sided, radiated to her back and left flank.
Cardiac enzymes were sent which showed Trop I of 0.68, CKMB of 1.3, then increased to Trop I 1.07, and CKMB 2.3 the following morning.
She was then placed on BiPAP by EMS and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
In the ED, her vital signs were HR 81 BP 122/39 93% on 2L n/c RR 16.
The patient was found to have a Hct drop to 26.7 and was guaiac positive.
Other labs showed Trop of 0.41 and worsening renal function at 2.7. .
She was found to have a decreased respiratory rate and an O2 sat in the 80s on 4L NC.
The patient was placed on a non-rebreather and an ABG was sent which showed respiratory acidosis.
Her respiratory rate and 02 sat initially improved, however then decreased again.

Portable chest ([**4-5**]): The heart is enlarged.
ECHO ([**4-7**]): The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-3-28**], global LV systolic function appears mildly hypokinetic on the current study.
