Brief Hospital Course: 54 year old male with PMH significant for HIV (on HARRT, last CD4 629), ESLD, HCV cirrhosis w/ possible left lobe liver cancer, who was being admitted to the ICU w/ AMS  # Cirrhosis: The patient has known Hepatitis C, both by history as well as by viral load in hospital, as well as a reported heavy history of EToH use.
RUQ U/S showed a cirrhotic liver and ascities, but without evidence of cholecystitis or PVT.
Subsequent diagnostic tap did not reveal any evidence of SBP, however, as noted above, this was in the setting of having already received antibiotics.
The patient underwent an MRCP secondary to concerns from patient's PCP about [**Name Initial (PRE) **] possible liver lesions.
A repeat triphasic CT confirmed that the pattern of filling of the lesions in the liver was consistent with HCC.
On discharge, the patient was noted to have a CD4 count in in the 1000s, with an undetectable viral load.
The ID team indicated that the patient's HAART could safely be restarted once the LFTs were less than 2 x the ULN.
An AM cortisol was sent off to rule out adrenal insuffiency as a cause of hypoglycemia, but AM cortisol was within normal limits.
We got a CT scan which showed that this is likely to be liver cancer, however after discussion with you we decided that treating it would likely not make your life better and potentially make it worse.
