Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Correlation with prior imaging or renal ultrasound in 6 months is recommended for further evaluation.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2200-1-28**] 9:28 AM As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated.
Etiology uncertain but would consider COPD exacerbation (worsening SOB x several days with steroid burst per PCP); PNA (not visualized on CXR but may be dry); cardiac ischemic event (EKG without concerning changes but no prior); PE (CTA preliminary negative); aspiration (but was upright on toilet) or seizure (but reportedly worsened over several day period).
CTA negative for PE.
# Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 116**] be reactive vs infectious process.
Cardiac enzymes were indicative demand ischemia.
# Renal cysts: Noted on CT scan, patient should have repeat ultrasound in 6 months post-discharge.
