She will need her prednisone to be tapered at rehab as she improves.
This resolved with bowel movements and WBC count felt to be [**3-13**] steroids and they trended down to 16 on day of discharge.
These were held while she was acutely ill.  Sugars were high on the sliding scale so lantus qam was added and her sliding scale was uptitrated, it is attached to this summary.
#  Chronic dCHF/hypertension:  Patient has an EF >55% on her last TTE in [**12-17**].
Normal BNP in the ED and no evidence of volume overload on exam or CXR.
She was continued on diltiazem and lisinopril was added back as her blood pressure have been stable.
