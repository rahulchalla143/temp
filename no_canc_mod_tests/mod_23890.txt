There was concern for pharyngeal air related to her intubation and she underwent a Barium esophagram which showed no evidence of esophageal perforation.
A syncope workup was also done; the ECHO was essentially normal with only borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, EF was normal.
The carotid studies demonstrated normal carotid systems bilaterally.
Your echocardiogram showed borderline pulmonary hypertension (you should follow-up with your primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] this is not a cause of syncope).
The ultrasound of your carotid arteries was negative for any clots or other abnormalities.
