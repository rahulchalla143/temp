During my initial examination he was unresponsive to noxious stimuli.
Pupils 2 to 1.5mm, +corneals.
Forceful movements in all extremities  On discharge: A&Ox3 PERRL EOMs intact Face symmetrical Motor intact No pronator drift No otorrhea from R ear  Pertinent Results: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2134-9-18**] 1.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2134-9-18**] 1.
8 mm (from 4 mm) right temporal and 6 mm (from 3 mm) left temporoparietal extraaxial acute hematomas (likely epidural), progressed since the OSH CT 3 hours earlier.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2134-9-19**] 1.
Unchanged subgaleal hematomas and extensive skull fractures    Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 90904**] was admitted to the ICU intubated on the Neurosurgery for close neurological observation, airway management and strict systolic blood pressure control less than 140 in the setting of multiple intracranial hemorrhages and multiple significant skull fractures.
Serial head CTs were performed to rule out enlarging epidural hematomas.
His neurological exam continued to improve as and he was extubated on [**9-20**].
Repeat Head CT on [**9-21**] was stable compared to prior study.
As his neurological exam improved he was transitioned to the regular floor on [**9-21**] where he was evaluated by physical therapy and occupational therapy.
A dilantin level was 3.3, he was switched to keppra.
