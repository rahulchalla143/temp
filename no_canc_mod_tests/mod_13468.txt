The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for further evaluation.
He became hypotensive with a base deficit, decreased PCO2 and a hematocrit of 22.6.
On admission, his sodium was 137, potassium 3.5, chloride 106, CO2 16, BUN 25, creatinine 1.2, glucose 147, white count 5.8, hematocrit 27.9, platelet count 99, fibrinogen 588, PTT 34.8, lactic acid 3.2, INR 2.2, PTT 34.8, PT 22.8.
His AST was 1408, ALT was 861 on admission, and repeat was 1164, alkaline phosphatase was 311, total bilirubin was 1.1.
Blood cultures from [**Hospital3 **] were positive for gram- negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci and anaerobes.
An ERCP was done, and it was noted that his biliary stent was infected.
A duplex was done of the liver.
An abdominal scan demonstrated underperfusion of segments 2 and 3 in the left lobe of the liver with multiple fluid and gas collections, likely representing bile leak.
He underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram given blood cultures.
Overall he had left ventricular systolic function with an EF of 70%.
The patient underwent a hepatic arteriography on [**9-13**].
He also underwent a balloon angioplasty of the distal proper hepatic artery with good postangiographic result.
Blood cultures on admission grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to imipenem, meropenem, otherwise resistant.
Urine culture was negative.
Repeat blood cultures on the 5th demonstrated Klebsiella pneumoniae with the same sensitivities.
Of note, the patient underwent placement of two 8 French pigtail catheters and 2 liver collections on [**9-12**].
Repeat duplex of the abdomen demonstrated main and left portal veins and hepatic arteries patent with appropriate wave forms.
His LFTs started to trend down with an AST of 52, ALT 280 and alkaline phosphatase of 257.
Repeat blood cultures from [**9-12**] were positive for enterococcus, as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae.
He had bile cultures that grew out Clostridium.
Repeat blood cultures on the 16th demonstrated enterococcus fecalis sensitive to daptomycin, resistant to vancomycin.
Subsequent blood cultures on the [**9-25**] were negative.
Sputum cultures were negative.
Chest x-ray done on the 13th demonstrated an interval decrease in the right pleural effusion without any consolidations.
The patient underwent repeat abdominal CT on [**9-27**].
He underwent a repeat angiography on [**9-27**] to evaluate the hepatic artery.
An MRV was recommended.
A liver duplex was done to evaluate the venous system.
There was limited evaluation of the liver parenchyma secondary to overlying bandages.
After the hepatic artery stent was placed, his alkaline phosphatase continued to increase slightly each day from 304 up to 406.
Total bilirubin remained in the 0.6 range.
His AST was 38, ALT 62.
His creatinine remained stable throughout this hospital course at 0.5.
Vital signs were stable.
The length of course of antibiotics depends on further repeat imaging to assess the resolution of hepatic collections.
He should also have a CBC with differential, LFTs, CHEM10 and trough Rapamune levels every Monday and Thursday.
