He was taken to OSH where T98 HR 61  BP 121/62.
He had a head CT that was read as L hemisphere stroke x mass and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Upon review with radiology, CT demonstrated L MCA stroke 8.6 x 7.6 cm, with early uncal herniation; 4-5mm left-[**Hospital1 **] shift with possible hemorrhagic transformation.

An ovoid area of relative [**Name (NI) 13215**] within this region may reflect parenchymal sparing, due to collateral vascular supply.
ECHO thoracic: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Echo esophageal: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is significant mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and body of the left lateral ventricle, with 3-mm rightward shift of midline structures.
Susceptibility images demonstrate areas of low-signal intensity involving the putamen and the caudate nucleus, consistent with microhemorrhages.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 85443**] was admitted to neurology ICU for evaluation of large stroke.
On review of CT with the team, it was felt that the area of conern was an acute L MCA stroke and not mass.
He underwent repeat CT scan which showed no major changes.
An transthoracic echo showed no PFO, ASD, or cardiac source of embolism.
He was started on coumadin on [**7-14**], and continued on ASA 325 as a bridge until INR is therapeutic at goal range 2-3.
ASA and heparin sc can be discontinued when INR is [**2-18**].
It was discussed with patient's mother that after rehab patient will need urgent set up of a PCP to monitor patient's INR and coumadin dosing.
It was decided not to involve CT surgery yet, given the uncertainty that PFO closure has any advantage over anticoagulation, and the best course for this individual patient should be determined after his acute rehab is completed.
Hypercoaguable workup was negative (negative protein C/S, antithrombin II, factor V and prothrombin mutation, lupus anticoagulant, normal homocysteine, negative anti-cardiolipin, and negative [**Doctor First Name **]).
He had an HbA1c of 5.6 and an LDL of 123 for which he was started on a simvastatin 40 mg daily.
Aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): continue only until INR therapeutic on Coumadin.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: 5000 (5000) U Injection TID (3 times a day): continue only until INR therapeutic on Coumadin.
You were noted on CT scan to have a large stroke with some evidence of swelling.
You had an echo of your heart which did not show any source of blood clot.
You had a TEE which showed a small PFO (a hole between the [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] of your heart) with bearing down (called the valsalva maneuver).
We also sent a hypercoagulable workup which was all normal.
Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**] Date/Time:[**2184-9-14**] 3:00  You will need to make an appointment with a primary care physician when you are discharged from rehab to monitor your INR and your progress as an outpatient.
