On arrival to OSH his temp was 103 and he was initially normotensive.
Underwent CT scan of his abdomen which showed air in the biliary tree so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Surgical ICU for further management.
En Route to [**Hospital1 18**], reported hypotension/brady, thus on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], got 2L IVFs, BP better since.
Since his transfer blood cultures from the outside hospital became positive with 4/4 bottles growing [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] report.
He has been on Unasyn, he was also found to have [**1-21**] blood cx positive from the ER for Gram+ cocci in clusters, Vanc started (stopped [**10-24**] since CONS).
Had a right upper quadrant ultrasound that showed concern for possible air vs. stone in the gall bladder, and possible air in the left lobe of the liver.
After ERCP consult, it was recommended that he undergo ERCP for further evaluation, so he was transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU to facilitate his procedure and for further monitoring on [**10-24**].
Underwent ERCP on [**10-24**] with sphincterotomy, stone fragment extraction, no pus, no fistula.
Echo with mod-severe MR, nl EF.

CXR [**10-24**]: The lung volumes are lower on the current study.
CXR [**10-22**] IMPRESSION: Left basilar atelectasis.
RUQ U/S ([**10-22**]): wet read: gb collapsed with possible air (linear hyperechoic foci with dirty shadowing) although stone could have similar appearance- less likely given no stone on recent outside CT images.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification  A distal CBD filling defect consistent with a small stone was seen at the biliary tree.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old male with h/o hypertension, DM on insulin, CKD IV, chronic dCHF who presented to OSH [**10-22**] with one day of fevers, CT scan concerning for pneumobilia so transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
Subsequent blood cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] negative except 1 of 4 bottles on [**10-22**] in ER had CONS, deemed to be contaminant (esp given we had other bacteria isolated from OSH).
Given his bacteremia, plan for IV unasyn X14days total (until [**11-4**]) and RUE PICC was placed.
They felt it may have been due to relative hypotension/hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis and restarting lisinopril and lasix (got his home PO dose lisinopril 5mg and lasix 80mg PO on [**10-26**] am before labs were drawn).
We held his lasix and lisinopril and allowed his BP to be a bit higher to maintain perfusion.
We also did not resume his lisinopril and this can be resumed after a week or so if BP and creat are good after resuming lasix.
ARF on CKD IV: per OSH records, creat since [**8-26**] has been around 2.0-2.2.
-on [**10-26**] afternoon, creat 2.0->2.5-->2.8 on [**10-27**].
Klebsiella bacteremia/fevers: Given CT and US findings, initially concern for biliary source.
OSH UA/UCx negative.
CXR also negative on admission.
Echo with EF >55% and valvular dz (mod-severe MR) -got lasix 80mg PO home dose on [**10-26**].
