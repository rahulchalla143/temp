In the OSH ED, the patient was noted to be tachycardic and febrile to 101 with a bilirubin of 11.3 and increased alkaline phosphatase.
CT abdomen and ultrasound demonstrated gallstones, gallbladder sludge, and a soft tissue density causing obstruction of the distal common bile duct with biliary ductal enlargement.
CVP was 13 and urine output was poor with a total volume of 250mL over 12-24 hours.
CXR was unremarkable.
Blood cultures grew gram negative rods (later identified as klebsiella) and enterococcus.

Blood gram negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs from aerobic and anaerobic bottles.
[**1-6**] CT Abd pelvis with contrast: Ttwo focal areas of fluid seen adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach.
1) Cholangitis, Klebsiella/enterococcus sepsis: CT Abdomen at outside hospital showed a soft tissue density either within the duct or as it enters ampulla most consistent periampullary carcinoma or sludge and debris in distal CBD.
Further work-up for other causes of LFT abnormalities include HBV panel (negative),  HCV Ab (negative), AMA (negative), HAV IgM (negative), and RUQ ultrasound (no evidence of hepatic/portal thrombosis).
The patient should continue to have liver function tests checked twice a week as an outpatient to ensure downward trend.
She will follow-up with the biliary service in mid-[**Month (only) 404**] for repeat ERCP and stent removal.
An Abdomen CT showed 2 small fluid collections along the curvature of the stomach; it was unclear whether these represented abscesses or focal collections of abdominal fluid.
She will have a repeat Abdomen CT on [**2111-2-9**] to follow these lesions for resolution.
FeNa was 3%, not consistent with a pre-renal etiology and urine eosinophils were negative, making acute interstitial nephritis less likely.
At the time of discharge, the patient's creatinine is 1.7.
Her creatinine should be monitored twice a week as an outpatient to ensure stability.
If her creatinine improves, addition of afterload reduction may be considered.
An echocardiogram revealed an EF 50%, 2+ MR, 2+ TR.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled, which were not consistent with myocardial ischemia  4) Atrial fibrillation: The patient had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR while in the ICU, most likely related to hypoxia/stress.
7) Anemia: At the time of discharge, hematocrit is 35.
UPEP/SPEP (-), Fe studies c/w ACD, normal vitamin B12/folate.
She will need to have her hematocrit closely monitored as an outpatient to ensure stability.
Unchanged EKG, cardiac enzymes negative, EF 50%  9) Endometrial thickening: Noted incidentally on abdomen CT. Outpatient follow-up (pelvic ultrasound, biopsy) at the discretion of her PCP.
