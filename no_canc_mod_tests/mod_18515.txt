Pain was never this severe and never had diaphoresis previously.
She initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where vitals were T97.9 HR: 147 BP: 134/99 Resp: 18 O(2)Sat: 100 Normal.
INR 2.6, troponin(t) 0.746.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.3 110 114/86 16 99% Labs and imaging significant for CXR which showed clear lungs fields with some vascular fullness.

LV systolic function appears depressed.
Right ventircular systolic function is normal with normal free wall contractility.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-2-2**], the findings are similar.
Cardiac MRI [**2133-2-5**]: 1.
Late gadolinium contrast-enhanced CMR images demonstrated patchy transmural late gadolinium hyperenhancement of the basal to mid inferior wall and true apex, sparing a small segment of the distal inferior wall.
Multiple sub- centimeter simple cysts are noted in the left kidney  CXR [**2-6**]: Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to [**2133-1-31**].
# Chest pain/NSTEMI: Troponin(t) elevated to 0.7 at [**Location (un) 620**], up to 0.87 at [**Hospital1 18**].
EKG showed lateral TWI and some non-specific ST changes.
Cardiac cath on [**2-3**] showed 40% LAD disease.
TTE showed focal wall motion abnormality (though not congruous with LAD lesion) and new decrease in EF (45%).
Cholesterol panel out of range (per below), last A1c [**2129**] 5.6% .
TSH on [**2132-11-19**] of 1.7.
On [**2-5**] she had a cardiac MRI for staging for a planned pulmonary vein isolation procedure.
On [**2-8**] she had an episode of rapid Afib that responded to dronadarone and ranolazine.
On [**2-9**] her QTc found to be prolonged, therefore dronadarone was d/c.
# PUMP: TTE 1 year ago with normal function, now with EF 45% and wall motion abnormality.
Will need repeat TTE in future to assess myocardial recovery after this acute event.
Discussed with EP attending of record who did not feel swallowing study was necessary.
Last chol panel: [**2132-11-20**]: total 181, trig 113, HDL 47, LDL 106.

You had a cardiac catheterization, which showed no major blockages in your heart's arteries.
We did find reduced function in your heart, likely from a rapid heart rate due to the atrial fibrillation.
