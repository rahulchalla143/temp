Serial Hcts performed showed drop from baseline 30 to 22 to 20.
EGD [**1-17**] showed clot and oozing in the efferent jejunal limb, which was injected.
The hematocrit continued to fall, and the pt received further transfusions.
Repeat EGD that evening showed oozing in the efferent jejunal limb and an identifiable vessel, which was injected and cauterized.
The patient remained HD stable but continued to require 5 more units of PRBCs overnight for a total of 9 units since admission, the Hct was 20.
A bleeding scan was negative.
She was extubated on POD 1 and transfused further 3 units for downtrending Hct 27 to 24.
On POD 3 she developed afib and was placed on beta-blockade; other VS and Hct were stable.
Overnight she experienced bilious and fecal emesis, associated with CP and non-specific EKG changes.
cardiac enzymes were negative and an NGT was placed.
A KUB showed no evidence of obstruction, but the pt remained symptomatic.
A small-bowel follow-through was concerning for SB obstruction.
Tube study did show contrast passing the anastamosis and the pt was treated conservatively and followed clinically.
Head CT was negative and but MRI showed R corona radiata CVA.
Carotid duplex were negative (<40% stenosis BL).
TTE showed LVEF 30-40%, mild AR, MR, and mod TR.
A CT scan showed a transition point but with passage of contrast.
She remained distended on POD 14 but abdominal plain films showed no dilated loops.
Blood cultures and catheter tip cultures grew enterococcus, sensitive to levaquin; the other antibiotics were discontinued.
One further transfusion was provided to bring the Hct over 30; which was subsequently stable.
