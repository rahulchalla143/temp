On arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient was tachycardiac to the 120s with saturations in the 80s, respiratory rate in the 30s and blood pressure ranging in the 70 to 80 systolics/40 diastolics with a temperature of 100.8.
The patient was bolused with 1 liter of normal saline which increased the blood pressure to 110/60.
Since his arrival the patient has had a negative head computerized tomography scan and abdominal computerized tomography scan negative for free fluid, free air or inflammatory processes.
The abdominal computerized tomography scan was positive for a large left pleural effusion with collapse and a moderate right pleural effusion.
His right upper quadrant ultrasound was positive for gallbladder wall thickening, large stone in the gallbladder, biliary sludge in addition to pericholecystic fluid and adenomyomatosis, all of which were unchanged from a prior study done prior to his admission.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Abdominal examination, obese, soft, nontender, nondistended.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission revealed white count of 12.1, hematocrit 32.5, platelets 224, left shift 98.6 neutrophils, 5.9% lymphocytes, 2.8% monocytes.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 105, bicarbonate 26.
BUN 21, creatinine 1.2, glucose 181, albumin 2.7, calcium 9.6.
TSH was 3.0 on [**9-12**].
Urinalysis was negative nitrates, trace leukocytes, [**7-8**] white blood cells, 0-2 red blood cells, AST 21, ALT 16, alkaline phosphatase 100, amylase 84, lipase 42, with total bilirubin 0.6.
Micro sputum gram stain, greater than 25 polys, greater than 10 eppys, 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs with clusters, positive gram negative rods.
Sputum culture pending.
Urine culture pending.
Blood culture pending.
Computerized tomography scan of the head and abdomen, no changes or pathology seen.
However, the patient's ejection fraction was improved as noted on a follow up echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 40%.
His hypotension improved dramatically as compared to the beginning of his stay with the addition of these agents.
The patient was maintained on pressor support ranging between 5 and 10 with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, with adequate title volume, respiratory rate and oxygen saturations.
We continued to maintain the patient's pressor support given his persistent effusions and muscle weakness, however, the patient did not show any evidence of distress.
The patient's follow up cultures have not been significant for gram negative rods, indicating complete resolvement of his Enterobacter pneumonia.
The patient is colonized with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and his follow up sputum to show gram positive cocci significant for Staphylococcus coagulase positive, however, the patient has already been treated with Vancomycin and is not exhibiting any signs pneumonia at this time and no further treatment is necessary.
Follow up liver function tests have been within normal limits and the patient has not exhibited a leukocytosis, temperature spikes or right upper quadrant tenderness indicating any progression of his gallbladder infection.
Follow up head computerized tomography scan at the end of [**Month (only) 216**] showed a stable subdural hematoma with no changes.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was continued with       5/75 cc/hr which was at his goal.
