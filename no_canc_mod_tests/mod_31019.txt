Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation demonstrated severe native three vessel disease.
Angiography of bypass grafts showed patent LIMA to LAD.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated filling pressures.
The mRAP was 19 mmHg and mPCWP was 38 mmHg.
The cardiac output and cardiac index were reduced at 3.9 L/min and 2.2 L/min/m2 with presumed oxygen consumption index of 125 ml/min.
Views are suboptimal for estimation of ejection fraction (?30%?).
IMPRESSION: 1) Increasing primary edema.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2124-2-2**]: INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Hemodynamic instability.
Coronary angiography of the left coronary artery showed a 60% distal LMCA stenosis, diffuse disease with up to 30% stenoses in the previously treated OM1 and a 90% ostial stenosis of the jailed LCX (which only supplied small OM2/3).
Resting hemodynamics showed mildly elevated right and left heart pressures with a preserved cardiac output.
