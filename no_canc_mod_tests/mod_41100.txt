Ultrasound showed compressible SVC.
Labs here notable for WBC 12.1, INR 3.2, Cr 1.3, and lactate 2.4.
CXR showed bibasilar opacities.
EKG showed fib or flutter at 59.

[**2101-9-5**] Cardiovascular ECHO The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2101-9-4**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND Study Date of [**2101-9-6**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Multiple nodules for which follow up with CT in 3 months is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: 89yo M PMHx bronchomalacia, Afib, recent OSH admission for PNA, who re-presented 1d after discharge w dyspnea and hypoxia requiring intubation, bronch and CT c/w bronchomalacia, e/o ongoing infection versus mucus plugging.
Upon admission to MICU, he had CXR showed possible bilateral pleural effusions, but pneumonia, especially in the retrocardiac space cannot be ruled out.
WBC is elevated but unclear whether this is due to prednisone vs infectious process.
A bronchoscopy was performed which revealed airways that were convoluted with sputum and mucous plugs.
A CT trachea was performed which showed severe tracheobronchomalacia with complete collapse of the trachea on expiration and severe narrowing of the mainstem bronchi; secretions in airways with complete obstruction of left lower lobe bronchus causing collapse of the left lower lobe, likely choronic; consolidation at right lower lobe which may be atelectasis, infectious or aspiration; multiple sub-centimeter nodules for which follow up in 3 months is required.
#Hospital acquired pneumonia: Evidence of RLL infiltrate on CT scan.
ECHO revealed normal EF without significant valvular dysfunction and only small pericardial effusion.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: thought to be most likely secondary to pre-renal as Cr trended down to 0.9 upon discharge with IVf.
# A. fib: Rate controlled with diltiazem with HR in 70s.
He came in with supratherapeutic INR of 3.2, which was reversed with vitamin K in preparation for bronchoscopy.
