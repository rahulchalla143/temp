An abdominal CT was performed which showed irregularly distended loop of distal bowel in the pelvis with questionable pneumatosis and with numerous foci of adjacent extraluminal gas which tracks into a right-sided anterior pelvic wall hernia.
Urine output was very poor, and after a renal consult was obtained, a temporary dialysis line was placed and the patient was started on CVVH-D.
Blood and urine cultures were sent, (no growth on either culture) and due to the large amount of fecal peritonitis, the antibiotic coverage was broadened to Vanco and Zosyn.
He was seen by neuro and also underwent Head CT, showing "Deep white matter hypodensities, more prominent on the right, are nonspecific and could be chronic".
WBC was noted again to be rising on POD 8.
Blood and urine cultures were again sent.
Urine culture was no growth, blood cultures are negative to date but not finalized.. A repeat abdominal CT was done on [**8-22**], the rectal anastomosis appeared intact with no focal fluid collection or evidence of developing abscess.
Over the next few days he was again afebrile, WBC which peaked at 18.7 was again down to 10.7 on discharge.
Urine output has improved to greater than one liter daily, however creatinine continues to rise between hemodialysis treatments.
