[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was seen in PCP's office [**12-12**] for follow up of recent CHF exacerbation and found to have SBP 140/70 and clear lung exam.
On arrival to ED, VS HR 82 BP 62/54 RR 20 O2 86% on 2 L nasal canula.
Pt given 2 L IVF with minimal improvement in SBP 70s and shortly developed increasing respiratory distress.
Discussion of lytics, but pt sent for CTA which did not show PE.
CTA showed B/L pleural effusions/ consolidations/ ?

RSR V2.
E/A ratio 0.80. mod pulm art htn.
CXR on admission: + increased interstitial markings, sl blurring heart border consistent with CHF.
Repeat CXR post intubation: increased R sided interstitial markings consistent with dramatically worsening CHF.
The pts  TTE on [**12-15**] was c/w with some diastolic dysfunction.
She will need an outpt stress test.
Once on the floor, the pt was satting at 92%RA while walking.
Hypoxic respiratory distress: The pts initial presentation (CP, SOB, hypoxia, hypotension) was extremely concerning for PE and the patient was started on heparin drip but CTA was negative for clot.
Cxr initially thought to be [**3-15**] aspiration but the pts clinical status had rapid resolution w/ diuresis.
#  Episode of Atrial Fibrillation--While the pt was in the MICU she had an episode of Afib with RVR (HR 120s).
Given EKG on admission was NSR and the A fib was noted the following day, her Afib was likely stress induced (from LV/LA volume overload in setting of stiff LV).
Her need for anticoagulation can be further evaluated on an outpt basis.
Pts BP was stable at discharge.
# Drop in hematocrit: Pt had Hct drop from 43 on admission [**12-14**], to 32 on [**12-16**].
She was found to have an LDL of 127 on [**12-15**].
Given EKG on admission NSR and A fib noted the following day, Afib likely stress induced.
She may need outpt PFTs and stress test.
Diastolic CHF 2.
