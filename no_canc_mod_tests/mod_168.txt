He recently underwent stress testng which was positive for ischemia.
Stress ECHO in [**Month (only) 216**] [**2140**] was notable for an LVEF of 55-60%.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization on [**2142-5-11**] revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.

[**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 50% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Ascending: 3.1 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.0 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.3 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 2.33  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Given his renal insufficiency, BUN and creatinine were monitored very closely.
His creatinine peaked to 2.2 on postoperative day two.
He was also noted to have diffuse ST elevation on electrocardiogram consistent with pericarditis and eventually went on to develop atrial flutter.
His forearm improved and he was discharged to home on POD#8 in stable condition.
He was anticoagulated with coumadin and will have his INR followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1511**].
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw an INR on saturday [**2142-6-8**] and fax results to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1511**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1512**].
