Admission Date:  [**2185-12-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-12-20**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9569**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pulmonary artery catheter placement   History of Present Illness: 81 yo M with CAD s/p MI x3 (last '[**76**]) and PTCA w/stent x2 to RCA and LCx(@ [**Hospital1 112**], [**11-5**]), systolic heart failure EF ~20% (by cath report; 35% by echo [**10-5**]) and IDDM, p/w SOB.
He underwent cardiac cath last month, as he was not a good candidate for CABG, but notes no improvement in sxs since the procedure.
He was last admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] [**Date range (1) 55744**], where he was treated for hyperkalemia in the setting of ARF with K 5.4 and Cr 4.1 (baseline 1.9-2.0).
He also c/o SOB at that time, but CXR showed no evidence of failure and he was d/c'ed home after his potassium had come down.
In the ED, he received ASA, SLNTGx1 (which relieved his chest tightness), lasix 40mg IVx2 and 0.5 in NTP.
He was hypoxic with O2 sats 84%2L, which increased to 87% on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was placed on BiPAP.
Cath at [**Hospital1 112**] [**2185-11-9**] showed 95% d2 ostial, 70% Cx, and diffuse RCA dz.
Cypher DES x2 were placed (RCA and Cx); estimated EF 20%; prior echo ?
[**10-5**] showed EF 35%.
-ischemic CM, as above -chronic renal insufficiency -GERD  Social History: Pt is originally from [**Country 3594**].

Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevted left and right-heart pressures (RA mean 20mmHg, PA mean 36mmHg, PCWP mean 21 mmHg).
The estimated cardiac output was 1.9 l/min.
1) Heart Failure: Pt's hypotension (most-likely explaining his acute weakness and LH this am) and hypoxia on presentation [**1-4**] decompensated failure as evidenced by CXR and exam.
Per [**Hospital1 112**] cath report, EF 20%.
Acute myocardial infarction was ruled out by EKG and negative enzymes.
A pulmonary artery catheter was place with elevated PCWP and elevated right sided pressures and a mixed venous 02 saturation of 24%.
Within two days the renal funtion began to improve and the liver enzymes began trending down.
It was felt that an inotrope was required and though pt had CRI digoxin would be the most beneficial medication to him at this time though it would have to be monitored closely.
