An echocardiogram at that time indicated an EF of 40 to 45% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, severe apical hypokinesis, moderate septal and distal hypokinesis and severe atrial fibrillation.
Her creatinine during that admission was noted to be elevated at approximately 2.1 with a baseline of approximately 1.6 by report.
Chest CT at the outside hospital showed an incidental finding of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary artery prominence.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile, temperature 97.8.
Heart rate 58.
Blood pressure 135/98 with an oxygen saturation of 81% on room air and 95% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
Her HEENT examination was unremarkable with pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Her neurological examination cranial nerves III through XII were grossly intact.
PERTINENT LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cells 7.2, hematocrit 26.0, platelets 152, sodium 141, potassium 3.9, chloride 101, bicarb 30, BUN 36, creatinine 1.6, CK were flat at 71 and 63.
Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 49, normal axis, mild PR prolongation consistent with first degree block and T wave flattening in the lateral leads.
Cardiac catheterization showed a proximal 100% left anterior descending coronary artery lesion, left circumflex was 70% proximal 100% mid occlusions, right coronary artery with 100% proximal and patent saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal grafts, 70% left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to ramus and posterior descending coronary artery totally occluded.
An left ventriculogram showed an EF of approximately 40%.
Her right sided filling pressures were markedly elevated with a right atrial pressure of 97/20, right ventricular 98/10, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 32 and 45 mm peak to peak pressure.
Within 24 hours of cardiac catheterization the patient's creatinine began to rise and urine output fall.
Her creatinine peaked on [**2111-2-10**] at 4.6 and she was evaluated by the renal team.
By the time of discharge her renal failure was resolving with her creatinine falling to 3.3 and continuing to trend down.
As part of her surgical evaluation a copy of her CT scan from the outside hospital was obtained, which showed 1 to 2 cm hilar and peritracheal adenopathy.
This biopsy did not reveal any malignant cells and instead showed a hypocellular specimen with a few group of bronchial cells, pulmonary macrophages, lymphocytes, red blood cells and neutrophils.
The pulmonary team recommended that she have a repeat CT scan in approximately eight weeks time to examine for any changes in her lymphadenopathy.
After transfusion her hematocrit was stable and was approximately 28 at the time of discharge.
The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41825**] on Tuesday [**2111-2-17**].
At that time it is expected that after checking a repeat chem 7 and her renal function that a number of her medications that were held secondary to her renal failure will be able to be reinstituted.
After her repeat CT scan she will again be evaluated at her cardiologist's discretion for possible AVR and coronary artery bypass graft.
Her other medications, which were effected by her renal function will be reinstituted as previously described when her renal function returns to baseline.
