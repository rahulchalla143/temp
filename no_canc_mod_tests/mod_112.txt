Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY VALUES UPON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  White blood cell count of 10,000, hematocrit of 32, platelet count of 201.
Sodium of 148, potassium 3.3, chloride 110, CO2 21, BUN 42, creatinine 3.7, glucose of 277.
Patient initially had an echocardiogram which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Chest x-ray on admission to the hospital revealed a small left pleural effusion, and questionable congestive heart failure pattern.
It was noted that the patient's Vancomycin and tobramycin levels were quite low upon admission to the hospital, and she was restarted on both of those medications.
On [**6-7**], hospital day two, the patient underwent a Plastic Surgery consultation due to persistent sternal wound infection, which had previously been healing now showing signs of infection.
The patient was ultimately taken to the operating room on [**2195-6-9**] after transesophageal echocardiogram the previous day ruled out endocarditis.
Patient continued on tube feeds via her jejunostomy tube which was previously placed during her previous admission, which she had been tolerating well.
She was still on the ventilator on varying levels of pressure support in the CPAP mode which she had tolerated well on 50% FIO2.
Patient's pressure support was ultimately weaned from 12 to 5, and she has remained on pressure support of 5 for the past few days with an FIO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 as well, and has remained stable on those ventilator settings.
The patient's condition day on [**2195-6-19**] is as follows: temperature is 99.0, heart rate is 88 in normal sinus rhythm, respiratory rate varies from 18-24.
Her blood pressure is 114/46.
On the ventilator, the patient is in a CPAP mode with 5 of PEEP, 5 of pressure support, and 50% of O2 with a most recent blood gas being 7.41, 41, 73, 27.
Other laboratory values from today, [**6-19**] are as follows:  White blood cell count 5.6, hematocrit of 35.8, platelet count of 206.
PT 13.9, INR 1.3, PTT 29.9, sodium 132, potassium 5.3, chloride 99, CO2 24, BUN 64, creatinine 3.6, glucose 124.
Patient's most recent chest x-ray was on [**2195-6-8**] which showed a chronic left pleural effusion.
Most recent cultures include a sputum culture from [**6-8**] which revealed MRSA, Pseudomonas, as well as Serratia.
Stool on [**6-10**] is positive for Clostridium difficile.
Urine on [**6-12**] is positive for proteus and enterococcus, and her sternal wound swab on [**6-9**] had rare growth of diphtheroids.
