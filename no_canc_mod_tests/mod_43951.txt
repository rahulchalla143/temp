A CXR did suggest a RLL infiltrate.
Labs were notable for leukocytosis to 11.4 and creatinine of 1.7 and sodium of 148.
Lactate was 3.6 upon arrival and then later down to 2.8.
There was concern that the pt was minimally responsive with eyes deviated to the R. Head CT performed which demonstrated evidence of chronic microvascular dz but no acute bleed.
Ultimately, LP performed showing only 1WBC and 1RBC and normal protein and glucose.
In total received 7L NS and has been documented to have 190cc urine output.
Pertinent Results: ecg #1: sr at 70 nl axis/intervals.
CXR [**3-4**]: Patchy opacitis consistent with a multifocal pneumonia are again seen in the right mid and lower lung zones.

CSF culture and initial studies were negative.
Sputum cultures have been thus far unrevealing.
Sputum culture was repeated on [**3-7**] and showed pan-sensitve serraita and the patient was switched to PO levofloxacin to complete a 14 day course.
During his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course, the patient had an episode of HTN urgency on the evening of [**3-4**] with bp 190/120s.
We avoided beta blockade in the setting of the patient's baseline bradycardia as well as an EKG which was possibly consistent with some form of intermittent AV block.
He remained in the ICU for one additional day for frequent suctioning, but the patient eventually refused this as well and his secretions decreased within 24 hours.
