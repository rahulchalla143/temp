CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A small hyperdense fluid collection is identified starting just inferior to the left renal lower pole in the retroperitoneum and extending down to the pelvic brim just superior to where the iliacus muscle begins.
The right aortofemoral bypass graft appears patent and again displays areas of focal thickening as noted on prior CT examination.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is marked stranding of the subcutaneous tissues, likely from prior surgery as well as multiple hyperattenuating soft tissue lesions, likely related to subcutaneous injections.
This was not noted on prior examination and may represent a normal post-surgical fluid collection, surgi-seal, or an early abscess.
The uterus, adnexa, rectum, and sigmoid colon appear otherwise unremarkable.

Since a reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the bad cholesterol).
