CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and sagittal reformatting again demonstrates a small amount of fluid around the ascending aorta without evidence of active contrast extravasation.
MRI/MRA CHEST FINDINGS: There is trace pericardial fluid, which appears significantly less when compared with the chest CT performed the same day.
IMPRESSION: Trace pericardial fluid, decreased when compared with the chest CT from earlier the same day.
CT BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collection, mass effect or midline shift.
ECHO [**10-3**] IMPRESSION: Normal study.
ECHO [**10-4**] Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artey systolic pressure could not be quantified.
Initial CT scan of chest showed some mediastinal fluid.
Her plain films of her knees, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine were all negative.
