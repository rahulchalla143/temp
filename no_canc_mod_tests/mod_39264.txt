The patient was scheduled for her HD today, and her vital signs in the AM were normal, although she was felt to be lethargic at her nursing home.
She was then brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation rather than going to HD.
The patient's [**Hospital1 **] glucose was 60 on admission in the ED.
This improved to 106 after a glass of OJ, which also improved her mental status.
She was A&Ox1 at time of initial evaluation in the ED.
FSGS 66 -> [x]oral OJ -> repeat 68 -> []oral OJ.
Her fever curve trended down so that she was afebrile at the time of leaving the ED at 22:28.
A CXR revealed pulmonary congestion.
Her abdomen was distended so a bladder pressure was obtained, which was 18mmHg.
A CT abdomen was obtained, which revealed no acute pathology.
Lactate was 1.5.
Of note, the patient has recently had the following discontinued or changed: Lantus 24U qhs increased to 26U; gabapentin increased from 300mg after HD to 400mg QID; ativan 0.5mg q8h PRN anxiety was d/c'd; buproprion was d/c'd, venlafaxine d/c'd.
