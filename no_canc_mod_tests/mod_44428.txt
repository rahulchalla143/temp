Overnight, he had a large bowel movement and then shortly after he became tachypneic (40-50s) and his oxygen saturation dropped to 88% on FiO2 of 35%.
His oxygen sats improved with increasing his FiO2 to 100%.
In the ED, his initial vital signs were significant for BP of 60/p, which improved to 112/51 on recheck, HR 99 with a temp of 104 and RR of 37.
Glucose was 116.
His pressure then drifted down to 71/37 despite receiving four liters of NS.
His labs were significant for a respiratory alkalosis, lactate of 2.2, WBC 8.1, Hct 31.8, troponin of 0.1 with a normal CK, AP 174 with normal other LFTs, Cr of 1.5 up from 1.0 and INR of 2.4.
Blood cultures were sent.
A CT torso was performed which showed LLL collapse and tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacification of the right lung fields with no intraabdominal pathology and no PE.
On transfer to the floor his vital signs were HR 115, BP 112/53 RR 36, 100% on FiO2 of 100%, T 101.5 with norepinephrine at 0.9mcg/kg/min.

multiple sputum samples were sent during course of stay however were insufficient.
CXR [**12-3**]:  Left basilar consolidation, likely reflecting lower lobe collapse and left pleural effusion, similar to the comparison study.
CT Torso [**12-3**] : CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: The pulmonary arterial system is well opacified and there is no embolic filling defect.
Nevertheless, there are areas of poorly marginated nodular type of opacity, which is new from the comparison study (3A:39), as well as areas of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] type opacities, also progressed from the previous study and together suggestive of infection.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The stomach contains a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube, which appears to be appropriately positioned.
An aortic dissection is visualized, similar to that seen on previous studies.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder contains Foley catheter and a small amount of gas.
Considerations include a hemangioma, or possible AV-malformation (?previous biopsy site).
EEG [**12-4**]: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations and no ictal or interictal epileptiform activity.
TEE [**11-19**]: No valvular vegetations or masses.
A Vancomycin level should be checked in the AM, and vancomycin dose adjusted accordingly.
# Sepsis: Found to have serratia bacteremia on OSH culture and then had sputum with GNR on [**12-10**].
Patient's electrolytes were checked and repleted daily while on the lasix drip.
At the time of discharge, patient's Creatinine was trending up, and this was felt to be most likely secondary to intravascular depletion from diuresis (although he remains total body volume overloaded).
EEG neg for seizure so likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic medications.
Coumadin titration is likely changed dilantin levels, and his dilantin level should be checked every few days going forward.
PTH was in Normal range of 34. .
# Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR was supratherapeutic to at 4.0 on the day of discharge.
His PM coumadin should be held and INR checked in the AM, and dose adjusted accordingly.
Goal INR is [**2-5**].
ASA was continued and repeat CEs remained stable with troponin of .11 and CKs did not increase.

Additionally, you had a decline in your renal function during the course of your hospitalization, likely related to receiving contrast for a CT scan at admission to the hospital and then receiving medications (Lasix) to help remove the IV fluids.
You were continued on Coumadin and should have your INR checked and your Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly after discharge.
Dilantin can also increase your INR so it is important to have this checked every 2-3 days after discharge.
Dilantin levels should be checked every few days.
Followup Instructions: You have the following apopintment scheduled: Provider: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6118**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6119**], RN,MS,[**MD Number(3) 1240**]:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1971**] Date/Time:[**2138-3-7**] 10:00  You also have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 851**] of Neurology on [**2138-1-7**] at 9:30am.
