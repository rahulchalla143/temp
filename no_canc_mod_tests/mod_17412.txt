<br> CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2101-9-4**] 10:24 AM FINDINGS: On the [**2101-8-4**] study, the stent was located in the thoracic area.
The stent in question has migrated proximally above the thoracic inlet since the prior study of [**8-4**].
<br> BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT  [**2101-9-2**] 3:35 PM There has been interval migration of the esophageal stent which now is located at the level of upper esophagus and distal pharynx.
The esophagogram demonstrated normal appearance of the gastric pull- through with no stricture or leak.
Consolidation in the left mid lung and right apex are unchanged and may represent slow resolving aspiration versus scarring.

Got laryngoscopy and endoscopy and all but one piece was removed.
Barium swallow showed no perforation.
She will have follow-up x-rays done as an outpatient (on [**9-9**] and [**9-12**]) to assess to location of the stent.
CXR is consistent with aspiration PNA.
Blood cultures were negative.

Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17g 1 packet po daily 7.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: Two (2) Spray Nasal TID (3 times a day).
You will need to have neck/upper chest x-rays taken to evaluate the stent location.
