Evaluation of the patient preferably with PA and lateral radiographs is recommended or if not possible, chest CT might be an option for evaluating of this area.
PROBLEM LIST: # Cholelithiasis, Choledocholithiasis, and Cholangitis: She had an elevated alkaline phosphatase and transaminitis on admission with imaging showing cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis.
If patient's condition is acceptable for undergoing an ERCP, repeat ERCP in 8 weeks for stent removal and stone extraction/lithotripsy occurs.
INR goal is [**3-11**].
Her Hct was followed which remained stable and the patient had no further episodes.
# Acute kidney injury (baseline Cr 1.1): Admission Cr 2.9.
Discharge Cr is 0.9. .
# Advanced dementia with overlying delirium [**3-10**] critical illness and metabolic abnormalities including hypernatremia, hypovolemia, [**Last Name (un) **], UTI, Cholangitis, and DVT.
Her O2 sats were normal on RA but she was placed on a 35% FM for comfort.
On [**10-26**] she had a transient episode of tachypnea vs agitation and a repeat CXR was obtained.
CXR at that time showed some worsening of pulmonary edema.
Pt should have repeat CXR to evaluate for resolution.
Right hilar prominence was noted and if unresolved, Chest CT may be pursued in the future.
The patient did receive vit K x 1 when INR rose to 2.
