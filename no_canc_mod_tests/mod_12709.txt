He was also having chest pain, and ECG had TWIs, changed from prior, so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
The patient's chest pain is not different than his usual pain.
NGL was done without any blood/coffee ground.
Patient's SBP was as low as 88 at one point, but for the most part was in the 100s/110s.
His hematocrit in the ED was stable compared to his earlier hematocrit at the OSH.

Cardiac Cath [**2139-8-13**]- "prelim" report Right dominant coronary angiography LMCA- minimal disease LAD- 70%ostial prior to prior stents, PTCA and BMS LCX- 100% in stent ostial/PTCA 3.0 with good result RCA- known 100% via prior cath         Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo male with history of coronary artery disease, who presented with melena, and was found to have an NSTEMI (chest pain, ECG changes, and elevated cardiac enzymes were present).
Melena: Patient was initially admitted to the MICU given ECG changes and melanotic stools with 10 pt hematocrit drop from baseline.
Initial hematocrit in ED was same as outside hospital.
Re-check after that was 29, so he received 2 more units given his chest pain, and slightly elevated cardiac enzymes and ECG changes.
EGD showed small ulcers and erosions, no active bleed.
hematocrit increased to 35 and remained stable through the rest of his admission, it was monitored every 8 hours and then every 12 until stable at 33-34.
His stool started to normalize with minimal melanotic stool before transfer from the ICU to the floor.
This was thought to be demand ischemia secondary to his hematocrit less than 30, which was then transfused to >30.
His cardiac enzymes continued to trend upwards, at which time it he was diagnosed with an NSTEMI.
ECG changes persisted at the time of transfer from ICU to cardiology service.
An ECHO was performed which showed depressed EF to 40% with new wall motion abnormalities, LV systolic dysfunction, worsening MR, and increase in artery pressures.
His cardiac enzymes and EKG were closely monitored.
He had a cardiac catheterization which showed 100% occlusion of stent in LCX ostial- which was treated with PTCA with good results.
His volume and kidney status were closely monitored.
His chest film was consistent with mild volume overload.
Repeat ECHO shows depressed EF to 40%, but last EF >55%.
BNP was greater than 10K.
Also his CHF was worsened with his pre-cath hydration given for renal protection, at which time in addition to receiving fluids his Lasix was temporarily held as creatinine was elevated.

Once you were no longer having bleeding, you had a cardiac catheterization which showed blockages of your heart stents.
