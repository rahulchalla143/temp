An ABG  revealed 7.16/69/323.
An echo done in the ED revealed no evidence of tamponade with global hypokinesis of her LV.
ECG revealed LBBB and was uninterpretable.
Pt had a trop of 0.2 prior to cath with CKs of 191,163, and 186.
Initial hemodymanics in the MICU: PA 35/16, PCWP 16, CO 4.5, CI 2.6, SVR 852, SvO2 66%.
An U/S of the area was neg for an AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
Aspiration PNA was considered, however felt to be unlikely given lack of infiltrates on CXR and improvement of symptoms w/o Abx.
Her swan pressures were WNL prior to removal.
Bld and Urine Cx's were negative and her CXR was w/o infiltrates.
(Baseline creat 0.9 - 1.2.)
Pt required 2 Units of PRBS for a hct of 25.8.
Her post transfusion hct was 31.6.
Her hct remained stable over the rest of her hospital stay and therefore, we did not feel it was indicated to check a CT of her Right groin for a retroperitoneal bleed.
