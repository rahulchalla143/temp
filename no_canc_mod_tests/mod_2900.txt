The patient was in her usual state of health at rehabilitation at [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation Center, when she was found to be lethargic with decreased blood pressure and a temperature of 104.6.
Blood pressure was 50/palpable.
The patient was seen by EMS at 9:45, placed on 100% nonrebreather and the saturations returned 99% on the nonrebreather.
The patient was given Tylenol and her temperature decreased at 6 am.
The blood pressure was 114/65 at 12/30 am.
The patient's heart rate was 130.
Oxygen saturation 95%.
Chest x-ray was done.
Blood pressure continued to fluctuate.
The patient had an abdominal CT done.
The EKG showed lateral T-waves V3 through V6, but no chest pressure and no CK troponin leak.
Calcium 500 once a day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the heart rate of 93, temperature 97.4, blood pressure 104/52, 100% on room air.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION IN HOUSE:  Labs revealed the following:  White blood cell count 24, hematocrit 25, platelet count 361,000, sodium 142, potassium 3.6, bicarbonate 22, chloride 106, BUN 19, creatinine .8, glucose 89.
Chest x-ray, when compared to [**2131-11-5**] showed persistent, but improved left lower lobe infiltrate.
Urinalysis revealed moderate bacteria.
The PTT was 35, INR 1.1.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were pending.
The ALT was 32, AST 44, alkaline phosphatase 310, amylase 23, total bilirubin .6.
The EKG on [**2131-11-15**] showed sinus rhythm of 96, T-wave flattening in V3 through V6, which was new, poor R-wave progression, old Qs and 3, AVF.
The abdominal CT showed biliary stent in place.
The CT showed air in the biliary system consistent with prior stent and subacute hypodensity in the right lobe consistent with prior laceration, overall clear source of infection.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient will need to check for transfusion if the hematocrit falls 8.
The patient did receive blood transfusions on [**2131-11-16**], as well as [**2131-11-17**].
The patient's white blood cell count continued to rise.
The patient has temperature spikes on [**2131-11-19**].
The patient then had a CT of the abdomen which noted abscess in the abdomen.
Second CT was performed of the liver showing minor fluid in the abscess and it was felt via the Department of Infectious Disease that this would be treated with the IV antibiotic.
Echocardiogram was performed, which showed left atrium normal size, ejection fraction greater than 55%, no pericardial effusion and normal heart function.
Urine culture, final, on [**2131-11-25**] showed no growth.
Abscess drainage on gram stain showed 4+ polys, 3+ gram-positive cocci, 2+ gram-positive rods, 1+ gram-negative rods.
Wound culture showed mixed bacterial types.
Abscess drainage showed Enterococcus, which was sensitive to Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Penicillin, and Vancomycin.
Anaerobic culture on [**2131-11-26**] showed bacteroides fragilis, moderate growth.
Stool culture, on [**2131-11-18**], revealed Clostridium difficile negative.
LABS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient had improved white blood cell count decreased to 14.7 with the hematocrit of 33.
The patient's platelet count was 548.
The patient has an incidental finding on chest x-ray and CT of pulmonary hilar lymphadenopathy.
On discharge, the patient's LDH was 218 within normal limits, as well as liver function tests normal.
The patient ruled out via enzymes and troponin I less than .3.
The patient's blood cultures from [**2131-11-22**] are still pending.
Calcium 500 once a day.
