She was taken to an outside hospital where she was noted to have a blood pressure of 80/40.
D-dimer and troponin were noted to be elevated, and the patient was evaluated with a V/Q scan, which was notable for a massive high probability right-sided PE and 2 small subsegmental left-sided PEs.
She was given Lovenox and Plavix and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.8 degrees, BP 133/83, heart rate 120, respiratory rate 26, and 96 percent on a 100 percent nonrebreather.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities: Warm with 1 plus DP pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cells 13.8, hematocrit 35.0, and platelets 282.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.8, chloride 100, bicarbonate 20, BUN 15, creatinine 0.7, and glucose 120.
PT 11.7, PTT 24.3, and INR 1.0.
CK 87, CK-MB 6, and troponin 0.11.
D-dimer 500 to 1000.
The patient was evaluated with lower extremity noninvasives that were negative for DVTs.
An echocardiogram was performed, which was significant for RV pressure overload and preserved LV systolic function.
Given the patient's obesity, antifactor Xa level was ordered, but could not be successfully coordinated with her Lovenox dosing and blood draws on the floor.
Arrangements were made with the patient and her primary care physician for blood draws and monitoring of her Coumadin and Lovenox doses.
The patient's oxygenation and respiratory status remained stable throughout remainder of her hospitalization.
An initial EKG taken during one of these episodes was significant for Q-wave inversions in the anterior leads that was considered likely secondary to lead placement.
The patient's cardiac enzymes trended down throughout her hospitalization, and her chest pain was considered likely secondary to a submassive pulmonary emboli.
The patient was noted to have somewhat low, but stable, hematocrit throughout her hospitalization.
Her Effexor, omeprazole, and Risperdal were continued.
