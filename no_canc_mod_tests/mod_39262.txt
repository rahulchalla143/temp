[**2181-3-16**] TTE Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-2-6**], the findings are similar.
[**2181-3-15**] NON-INVASIVE DUPLEX VENOUS STUDY OF THE RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY CLINICAL INDICATION: Morbid obesity and congestive heart failure with persistent right upper extremity edema.
Pulse Doppler waveform analysis shows symmetric flow in the right and left subclavian veins.
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: The Doppler examination is entirely non-diagnostic.
No Doppler examination could be performed as the visualization is extremely limited due to the patient's body habitus.
[**2181-3-3**] CXR SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST REASON FOR EXAM: CHF, improved oxygen requirement after aggressive diuresis.
Comparison is made with prior study [**2-26**].
Noted recent admission for the same concern, during which time a work-up for arrhythmia, seizures, medication effect was without clear findings.
Troponins were stably elevated and peaked at 0.28, thought to be due to renal failure.
She will need to start an ACEi when her creatinine stablizes.
While she is on aggressive diuresis, please check chemistry panel daily starting on [**2181-3-23**] and dose her potassium chloride daily to maintain a potassium greater than 3.5.
When she appears euvolemic by exam and by her laboratory values (creatinine = 2.3, BUN = 50, or bicarbonate = 40) then please decrease her torsemide to 100 mg once daily.
# ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Creatinine 1.4 on transfer, 2.0 on d/c date.
She was briefly treated with acetazolamide for low bicarbonate but this improved with improved creatinine clearance and she no longer needed the acetazolamide.
No e/o infection (blood cultures, urine cultures and CXR all clear).
Thus, her venlafaxine was decreased to 112.5 mg daily and buproprion to 100 mg daily.
Patient had arterial non-invasive imaging during last hospitalization which demonstrated patent popliteal and PT arteries on the right with known moderate RLE occlusive disease.
Wound consult followed closely, requested vascular surgery evaluation - they felt ulcers were stable, not-infected-appearing.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - needs follow-up appointment w/breast center, also for mammography and/or R breast ultrasound - needs psych/therapist after she gets to rehab - needs follow-up labs on [**2181-3-23**] and daily to check her potassium given multiple diuretics.
Also should check the creatinine given her acute on Chronic heart failure.
She should have this removed when her outpatient doctors think she [**Name5 (PTitle) **] not need frequent blood draws anymore or if it becomes painful or infected - she was not started on an ACE-inhibitor because her creatinine was still elevated on discharge to 2, this should be added in the future with nephrology input - Please check chemistry panel daily starting on [**2181-3-23**] and dose her potassium chloride daily to maintain a potassium greater than 3.5.
You were treated with diuretics and your weight went down significantly because you had a lot of extra fluid on your body.
It is also very important that you weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
