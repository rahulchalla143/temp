He was placed on respiratory precautions while a viral illness was ruled out; a rapid viral screen was negative for influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and RSV infection.
The differential for the trigger for his asthma exacerbation was broadened, and a mini-BAL was performed on [**2-10**] with sample sent for fungal culture and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 23426**].
LDH was 195, making PCP less likely.
# Steroid Prophylaxis: After discussion with Pulmonary prior to discharge pt was started on PCP prophylaxis with Bactrim as well as Calcium and Vitamin D.  # Demand ischemia:  During admission pt was noted to have an elevated Troponin level of 0.16 (which trended down) with negative CK and CK MBs.
The Hct dropped but stabilized and transfusion was deferred at family request.
GI was consulted but given that the Hct stabilized no emergent intervention was needed.
He failed a video swallow on [**2-19**] and a Dobhoff was placed.
