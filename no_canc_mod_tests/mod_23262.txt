States he had a similar episode and was hospitalized for pancreatitis [**2164-11-16**] where he was admitted with 1 day h/o abdominal pain, initial elevation of lipase and amylase consistent with gallstone pancreatitis.
The CT scan obtained during that admission revealed a peripancreatic fluid without evidence of pancreatic ductal dilatation or pancreatic necrosis.
No gallstones were identified on CT scan.
Ultrasound examination at that time revealed a 3-mm common duct.
Pericarditis in [**2158**] of unknown etiology treated with Indocin.

[**2165-3-2**] AP CXR: Bedside AP radiograph of the chest shows normal cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours.
[**2165-3-2**] ABD CT W&W/O CONTRAST: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service in the TSICU on [**2165-3-2**] for evaluation and treatment of epigastric pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes, initially consistent with gallstone pancreatitis.
Admission abdominal ultra-sound showed no fluid seen in right upper quadrant and no findings of acute cholecystitis.
Abdominal CT revealed inflammatory change and fluid surrounding the pancreas, consistent with acute pancreatitis.
Neuro: The patient was changed to a Dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
An MRCP was performed, which demonstrated findings consistent with acute pancreatitis, no evidence of complications, such as no necrosis or peripancreatic fluid collection.
Pancreatic enzymes were again mildly elevated on [**3-8**] with an Amylase of 171 (up from 115) and a lipase of 664 (up from 475).
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Admission blood cultures revealed no growth.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
He will return on Monday, [**2165-3-11**] for repeat pancreatic enzymes and LFTs, and then will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Friday, [**3-15**].
Followup Instructions: Please return to [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 3, [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] on Monday, [**2165-3-11**] for repeat labwork.
