Patient noted to be unresponsive at 1:45 p.m. and vital signs recorded at the time were 96.9, 88, 102/66, 22.
Patient became more responsive with an O2 sat of 85% prior to transfer to the Emergency Room.
An arterial blood gas performed at the time demonstrated a pH of 7.27, 54, 98 on 60% FIO2, AC 12 x 600.
MAT EF of 50% on last TTE in [**2128**].
Oxazepam 6.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  98.6, blood pressure 105/63, irregular, respiratory rate 12, heart rate around 60, O2 sats 88% preintubation, 99% post intubation, FIO2 post intubation, vent AC 12 x 600 FIO2 of 60%, general intubated, sedated, no spontaneous movement, not in acute distress.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 17, differential neutrophils 75, lymphs 21, monocytes 2.
Urinalysis:  Large blood, positive protein, greater than 50 red blood cells, 0 to 2 white blood cell count.
Electrolytes 142/3.1, 107/19; BUN 27/2.2, baseline is 1.2-1.5; glucose 162, INR 3.7; ABG 7.27, 54, 98; troponin 0.14; lactate 1.2.
EKG:  MAT at 99, 0.5 mm ST segment depressions in V4, V5, low voltage in limb leads, Q-waves in 3.
Patient's white blood cell count subsequently decreased to 10.6 by [**2130-9-26**].
Patient's creatinine was 1.5 on [**2130-9-26**].
Blood pressures not provided given history of COPD.
Patient transfused two units on [**2130-9-22**] after hematocrit of 24.
Cellulitis:  Further assessed with a CT.  A CT performed demonstrated a fluid density along the anteromedial skin surface which was most consistent with edema.
The patient's symptoms improved, and it was felt that an MRI would be low yield, and the patient did refuse the test.
Therefore, an x-ray was performed on [**2130-9-25**].
The [**2130-9-25**] x-ray of the left shoulder showed diffuse osteopenia catheter-imposed humeral diaphysis most likely representing a PICC line.
