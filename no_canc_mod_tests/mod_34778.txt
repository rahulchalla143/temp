MR enterography was also performed and showed dilated CBD,  with associated intra and extrahepatic ductal dilatation, atrophic pancreas.
HCT at that time was 29.7.
He was evaluated at OSH where he was tachycardic to the 140s but BP 130-160s.
Hct returned at 22, NG tube revealed coffee grounds but then reportedly had frank blood.
Here in the ED tachycardic to 120s with BP 160s systolic, intubated for inability to protection.

[**2183-1-30**] CARDIAC ECHO: Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Limited evaluation of the stomach and pancreas due to patient motion.
Neighboring hyperdense material likely reflects injected contrast from prior evaluation of the drains.
No acute intracranial process; however, please note that portions of the brain are suboptimally evaluated due to motion artifact.
If there is concern for mechanical bowel obstruction, however, CT may be obtained for further evaluation.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient well known for Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was transferred from OSH to the General Surgical Service for evaluation of acute UGIB and altered mental status.
On admission patient's HCT was 23.4, the patient underwent CT abdomen which showed no new collections, EGD showed friable necrotic tissue in fundus of stomach, possible gastric varices.
Neurology was consulted and recommended head CT was negative for intracranial pathology.
TTE revealed preserved biventricular systolic function and change in cardiac rate was secondary to increased vagal tone.
CV: After patient was extubated and sedation was weaned off, patient's heart rate and rhythm returned to [**Location 213**].
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
The patient's abscess culture came back positive for PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA and ID was called for consult.
Fistulogram of the right psoas abscess was positive for psoas drain-enteric fistula.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; he received total 4 units of RBC during hospitalization.
Prior discharge patient's HCT was 32.6.
