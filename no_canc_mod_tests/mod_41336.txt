Diagnostic paracentesis neg for SBP [**8-24**] so not cause of leukocytosis and abd pain.
Pt put on Zosyn [**8-24**] and completed 7d course with some improvement in WBC count and bili though not normalized.
Repeat C diff [**8-30**] again neg.
Pt with persistence of mild leukocytosis with WBC count of 15 on day of discharge but in setting of downtrending bili we were reassured of improvement with coure of zosyn for acalculous cholecystitis.
# Abdominal pain and distension: During ICU stay KUB showed gastric outlet obstruction but CT and EGD did not show any anatomic dysfunction.
Subsequent KUBs showed air in the small and large bowel.
Repeat RUQ ultrasound [**8-22**] showed diffuse gallbladder wall thickening with biliary sludge concerning for acalculous cholecystitis.
After zosyn course, pt put back on Cipro for SBP ppx on [**8-31**].
# Embolic stroke: While in the ICU, patient had acute onset of left sided weakness and brain imaging showed an embolic stroke in the R MCA likely from a known DVT and patent foramen ovale.
Bronchoscopy performed and BAL (as well as endotracheal sputum) grew MRSA.
Patient underwent upper endoscopy by GI on hospital day 1.
Was noted to have severe esophagitis, a biopsy was taken with copious bleeding from the site noted following biopsy.
Patient required 2u pRBCs and was maintained briefly placed on Levophed, blood pressure improved and pressors were discontinued.
Last transfusion [**8-21**].
# Anemia: H/H slowly downtrending with Hct of 25.7 [**8-31**].
Will need to continue to trend H/H and tranfuse for Hct <21.
# Pt will need biweekly lab monitoring (CBC, INR, LFTs, Chem10) and tranfusion for Hct <21.
# Studies pending at time of discharge: PTH, peritoneal fluid acid fast culture from [**8-8**] # F/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in liver clinic and with transplant surgery re: permanent HD access.
