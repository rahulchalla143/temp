An indwelling biliary tube was left in place and a postoperative cholangiogram demonstrated adequate emptying of the bile duct.
He was discharged to rehab on [**2129-7-28**] and was readmitted with a subhepatic abscess, which was drained percutaneously by IR (Not bile, culture grew klebsiella and citrobacter).
The patient was transferred in the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Physical Exam: Upon Discharge: VSS, Afebrile GEN: Baseline anxious and confused, AAO x 3 CV: RRR RESP: CTAB Abd: T-tube in place draining bilious fluid, abscess drain in place draining scant amount of white/yellow opaque fluid, non-tender, well healing transverse incision c/d/i LE: WWP, no edema   Pertinent Results: Fistulogram [**2129-8-17**] 50 cc of Optiray contrast was slowly hand injected into the abscess drainage catheter under fluoroscopic guidance.
Further injection opacified two narrow tracts originating from the primary collection that were believed to be extraluminal.
Further injection of contrast showed communication between the main collection and the cystic duct which then lead to full opacification of the cystic duct and subsequent opacification of the common bile duct and the biliary tree.
TTube Cholangiogram [**2129-8-18**] FINDINGS:  50 cc of Optiray contrast was slowly hand injected into the biliary tube under fluoroscopic guidance.
Further administration of contrast shows opacification of the cavity where the drainage catheter is located.
However, on the previous study it appeared that the communication through the cystic duct was the more likely scenario.

He was admitted to the ICU on [**2129-8-16**] and was found to have a hematocrit as low as 18.2.
A large clot was seen overlying the ulcer.
The patient's hematocrit increased appropriately and remained stable in the range of 26 to 27.
His T-tube and Abscess drains were also studies.
The decision was made to keep his T-tube and Abscess drain in place for his discharge.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
