Exam was notable for the absence of wheezes and a CXR was read as interval improvement in previously present bibasilar infiltrates.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2131-11-30**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
CXR [**11-27**] IMPRESSION: Marked interval improvement in previous pattern of patchy bibasilar opacities.
CXR [**11-29**]:  HISTORY: Emphysema.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs since [**2129**], most recently [**11-27**] and 6:  Coarse interstitial abnormality in the left lower lung has worsened accompanied by increase in small left pleural effusion and hypervascularity of the left lung.
CHEST X-RAY [**12-2**]  HISTORY: Short of breath, possible volume overload or pneumonia.
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS: Comparison with previous study done [**2131-11-29**].
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
His sputum cultures were unrevealing and his white count trended down.
Chest xray was read as possible asymmetric pulmonary edema, and a BNP was sent and it was elevated at around 2550.
He was diuresed about 2 liters and a repeat chest xray demonstrated improvement.
An ECHO showed preserved systolic function.
He was discharged on a 2 wk prednisone taper, levofloxacin to complete 10 days and with close f/u with PCPs office in addition to VNA care for cardiopulmonary assessment and home safety evaluation.
