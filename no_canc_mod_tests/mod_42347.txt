CT abd/pelv [**11-12**]: 1.
CXR [**11-12**]: Bilateral lower lobe opacities, possibly representing aspiration or atelectasis.
CXR [**11-13**]: Basal densities developing over the last two days and are suggestive of bilateral pleural effusions.
Complete PA and lateral chest view is recommended for further confirmation of the somewhat subtle findings.
A previous abdominal chest CT of [**2149-11-12**], included images of the basal portions of the lungs disclosed bilateral pleural effusions as well as some atelectasis in the dependent portion of the posterior segments.
This finding is consistent with findings observed on the single portable chest view, which however, cannot present same detail as the CT examination.
CXR [**11-14**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**11-13**].
RLE LENI [**11-15**] 6am: This examination had suboptimal images of the superficial femoral vein and was repeated.
His anion gap closed, and he was started on NPH at 15u [**Hospital1 **] given his poor PO intake (on 25u [**Hospital1 **] at home).
Leukocytosis - The patient presented with a WBC of 24.
This was initially thought to be a stress reaction similar to that evidenced in a prior admission, but after one blood culture grew E coli he was started on levofloxacin and flagyl.
The remainder of the blood cultures were positive, including the other 3 from that day, and he had no source of infection, nor was he febrile.
His WBC trended down and was normal at discharge.
ARF - He was admitted with a Cr of 3.2, a similar elevation to his last admission for DKA.
He was aggressively hydrated with IVF and his Cr was 0.7 on discharge.
Hyperkalemia - On admission, he had peaked T waves on ECG and a K of 8.3.
Outpatient echo was recommended to re-assess his LVEF.
Socioeconomic issues - The social worker was extensively involved in this hospitalization.
One Touch Test     Strip Sig: One (1) strip Miscell.
E. coli bacteremia of unclear etiology  Discharge Condition: Stable; he is no longer in DKA, blood sugars are normal, electrolytes are normal.
