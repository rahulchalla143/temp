RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2169-10-5**]): SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
(pan sensitive) [**2169-10-2**] HIV-1 Viral Load/Ultrasensitive (Final [**2169-10-3**]): HIV-1 RNA detected, less than 48 copies/mL.
[**2169-10-3**] CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2169-10-4**]):     Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Doppler examination is limited as patient was unable to hold his breath due to the intubated status.
Doppler evaluation of the IVC is limited.
CXR [**9-29**]: Greater opacification in the left lower lobe is probably worsened atelectasis.
CXR [**10-8**] (s/p NGT placement): FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely to reflect an improved ventilation.
[**10-3**] CT Head- No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
[**10-5**] EEG- This EEG showed some low voltage patterns alternating with widespread alpha frequencies.

Repeat EGD was not performed as patient did not have further episodes of variceal bleeding.
Patient received 5 days of CTX for SBP PPX.
Blood pressure improved on arrival to ICU and dopamine was weaned.
On discharge, patient was breathing comfortably on room air and lung exam had cleared.
Recommended CT head (negative for acute process) and continuous EEG monitoring for seizures (drowsiness/mild encephelopathy, negative for seizures on [**10-3**] and encephelopathy w/ some medication effect on [**10-5**]).
HIV VL was checked and was undetectable.
Was monitored on EEG with no epileptiform activity.
You underwent endoscopy and banding of esophageal varices (enlarged blood vessels in your throat) at your local hospital in [**Location (un) **] and were transferred here for further care.
You must also have a repeat upper endoscopy performed to evaluate your varices in the next 1-2 weeks- you can schedule that in [**Location (un) **] or return here for this procedure as we discussed.
You will also need to have a repeat endoscopy performed to evaluate the status of your esophageal varices.
