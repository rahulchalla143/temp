Vital signs in the Emergency Department on admission were temperature 96.2 degrees, pulse 117, blood pressure 90/54, respiratory rate 28, oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
HEENT examination revealed extraocular movements intact.
The chest revealed decreased breath sounds on the left side but the chest was difficult to auscultate due to tracheostomy tube, questionable crackles on the left side.
Examination of the heart revealed inability to auscultate S1 or S2.
There was tenderness to palpation in both lower quadrants.
Rectal examination was guaiac positive.
The skin revealed multiple ecchymoses on both arms bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medicine team with an initial blood pressure of 90/54 and heart rate of 117.
The blood pressure increased to 115/56 and heart rate was 89 with 1 liter of normal saline.
However his hematocrit decreased from 33 to 28 and he was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight.
His hematocrit continued to decrease to 23 and he had another large melanotic stool.
After the endoscopy, the patient was moved back to the floor and overnight he had another very large melanotic stool and more coffee ground emesis and his blood pressure decreased to 70/40 at which point the decision was made to transfer the patient to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for emergency endoscopy.

On his second day in the MICU, repeat endoscopy was performed at which point endoscopic clipping of the vessel was successful.
However the patient's hematocrit decreased to approximately 28 and the patient received another unit of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit continued to climb.
His hematocrit appeared stable.
He had one small melanotic stool but his hematocrit had remained above 30 and he had not required any further transfusions.
Total amount of blood transfusion the patient had required over the hospital course had been 8 units of packed red blood cells.
