However, repeat head CT on [**2106-6-28**] failed to show resolution of the lesions, so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
On CT scan, there were diffuse ground glass opacities and infection was presumed, although no micro dx was made (AFB smears negative, legionella/mycoplasma negative).
HIV RNA returned >500k, CD4 of 9.
Head CT revealed 1 cm lesion in the R thalamus and 2x2 cm lesion in R parietal lobe (no ring enhancement).
He was unable to get an MRI because of residual shrapnel.
A f/u head CT scan [**6-27**] revealed only slight improvement in R parietal ahd thalamic lesions, so he was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a 2nd opinion and further imaging and/or brain biopsy.

Brief Hospital Course: This 40 year old gentleman recently diagnosed with AIDS was transferred from an outside hospital when new brain lesions were found in a workup for mental status changes.
Shortly thereafter he underwent a lumbar puncture which was non diagnostic.
The EGD revealed severe erosive candidiasis--a few days later the patient developed hematemesis/upper GI bleed with hemodynamic instability (of note pt was pancytopenic in this setting).
Repeat endoscopy confirmed general bleeding from the inflammed upper GI mucosa-a biopsy revealed the presence of HSV.
His pancytopenia resolved and he showed no signs of immune reconstitution syndrome and by this time his mental status had normalized .
Serial head CTs revealed no change in the brain lesions.
While at [**Hospital1 18**], a brain biopsy was performed on [**7-2**] which was nondiagnostic.
A lumbar puncture on [**7-6**] also did not confirm a diagnosis.
He had a thallium SPECT scan and a FDG PET CT scan, both of which ruled out CNS lymphoma.
Head CT on [**7-13**] revealed stable CNS lesions but a new small SDH; his neuro exam through his admission was notable for improving left-sided weakness.
Repeat head CT on [**7-22**] showed stable lesions and SDH.
An EGD was performed on [**7-5**], which demonstrated severe erosive esophagitis consistent with candidiasis.
The biopsy was negative for [**Female First Name (un) 564**], positive for HSV, after which steroids were discontinued and he was started on acyclovir on [**7-8**].
His LFTs began to rise, and Caspofungin was discontinued on [**7-14**], with LFTs trending down at discharge.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**7-9**], which showed a hypocellular marrow, negative cultures, likely consistent with HIV infection vs medication side effect.
His counts were trending up at discharge.
