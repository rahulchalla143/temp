Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to left circumflex artery - Attending Physician: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) 33746**], MD  History of Present Illness: 57yo F PMHx morbid obesity, DM, HTN, HLD, asthma, history of ASA allergy (induced cough, worsened asthma symptoms) who was initially admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] [**12-3**] w L arm pain, found to have Lcx lesion, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and ASA desensitization protocol.
Given comorbidities, coronary CTA was ordered to better risk-stratify based on her coronary disease, which was reportedly abnormal (no report available at this time).
This prompted cardiac catherization that demonstrated 3VD w mild RCA and LAD disease, as well as critical mid LCx lesion.
At [**Hospital1 18**] patient underwent cardiac cath via L radial, underwent placement of DES to mid-Cx without complication.

# 3 Vessel Coronary Artery Disease s/p PCI with Stent: She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of critical stenosis of her mid left circumflex coronary artery.
Following stent placement, treatment with aspirin became a priority and in consultation with the allergy and immunology team, she underwent a 6 hour desensitization protocol involving montelukast prior to initiation and frequent, escalating doses of aspirin with serial peak flow measurements and close monitoring on tele for possibility of developing a severe reaction.
# Thrombocytosis: Stable with PLT counts in the high 300's to mid 400's.
Her hydrea was held overnight on the day of admission and restarted on discharge.
#This patient would likely benefit from an outpatient ECHO to assess her cardiac function in [**4-25**] weeks .

A cardiac catheterization was performed via the left radial artery with placement of a drug eluting stent in your left circumflex coronary artery.
Your asthma was monitored with peak flow measurements and was stable throughout the desensitization.
You will need a repeat EKG and Echocardiogram at this visit.
