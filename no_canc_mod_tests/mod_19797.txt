Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic systolic arterial pressures, with a central aortic pressure of 135/59, mean 66 mmHg.
TTE ([**2168-1-16**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Post-cath echo showed normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction (LVEF 55%) c/w CAD (LCX or Diagonal distribution) amd mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Blood cx and urine cx NGTD.
#.Hypertension:  Patient's blood pressures ranging from SBP 130s-160s on admission; on amlodipine and losartan at home.
Hyperlipidemia- Lipid panel from [**12/2167**] demonstrated TC 210, HDL 44, LDL 148, TG 90.
# Pulmonary nodule: CXR showed incidental right upper lung opacity approximately 11 x 7 mm in diameter, slightly increased in size since previous study.

Outpatient Lab Work Please check Chem-7 on Friday [**1-22**] with results to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2563**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2564**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2258**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: ST elevation Myocardial Infarction Hypertension Diabetes mellitus Dyslipidemia Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG was completed and it indicated that you had a Myocardial Infacrtion (MI), also known as a heart attack.
Your heart rate and blood pressure were stable, but you were taken to the Cardiac Intensive Unit (CCU) for further monitoring.
An echocardiogram was also completed, which showed that your heart function is essentially normal following the heart attack.
You had a low-grade fever, but urine and blood cultures were all negative and your chest xray did not indicate a pneumonia, your fever resolved, and you did not need any antibiotics.
INCREASE the Aspirin to 325 mg daily to protect your heart and decrease your risk of blood clots.
ADD a new blood pressure medication, Metoprolol Succinante 25mg daily, and stop an old one, Amlopidine, because Metoprolol better protects your heart after a heart attack.
