In the [**State 1558**] emergency department he was found to be febrile with a hematocrit of 23% and worsening hypotension.
Blood cultures drawn at the time of admission to the emergency department showed 4 out of 4 positive for streptococcus salivarius.
Bronchoscopy performed soon thereafter showed positive cultures for [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
It was agreed that the patient would be transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for evaluation for possible liver and/or kidney-liver transplant.
LABORATORY RESULTS ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 104, CO2 24, BUN 110, creatinine 6.7, glucose 75, hematocrit 23, platelets 63, calcium 8.6, magnesium 1.5, phosphorus 2.1.
Cardiovascular examination is regular rate and rhythm.
Initial evaluation at that time by the transplant team concluded that the patient's presentation was most consistent with resolving sepsis, acute renal failure and possibly adult respiratory distress syndrome.
A delicate balance had to be maintained for diuresis and dialysis needs which were maintained using CVVHD and Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure maintenance.
Repeated culturing and imaging failed to reveal any undiagnosed sources for this infection.
His blood pressure was refractory to additional pressors.
On [**2193-6-27**] or hospital day 10, with patient's white blood cell count at 36.1, pressor support maxed out, patient's family including his mother, the designated health care proxy, requested that he be made Do Not Resuscitate, Do Not Intubate and life support be gradually withdrawn.
