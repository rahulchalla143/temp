A chest/abdominal CT showed possible pancreatitis changes but limited exam, with CBD at 7 cm, along with a hiatal hernia, and acute pulmonary abnormalities.
She subsequently had [**5-1**] blood cultures with gram negative bacilli and some gram positive cocci.
At admission, her SBP was in the 120s, but overnight dropped to the 80s systolic.
She was treated with IV fluids to maintain her BP which held stable with SBPs in the 80s.
A femoral TLC was attempted unsuccessfully.
On the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], her LFTs and amylase/lipase rose dramatically.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and possible ERCP.

Upon admission, OSH microbiology data showed gram negative rod bacteremia and few GPCs.
Pt had been fluid resusiciated for hypotension (asymptomatic) at the outside hospital but, per report, did have persistently low blood pressures (ranging 70-80 systolic) that eventually responded to IVFs.
Consyntropin stim test showed inadequate response so pt was started on stress dose steroids (fludrocort and hydrocort).
Patient was briefly placed on Levophed for a MAP <60 but this was discontinued after family meeting and decision was made to make patient comfort-measures-only.
OSH CT showed normal CBD, but her clinical picture was concerning for obstructing gallstone.
