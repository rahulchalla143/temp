Her baseline hematocrit is 38-41.
Her hematocrit on arrival was 37.9; four hours after arrival was 37.0.
Sigmoid diverticulosis seen on colonoscopy in [**2144-7-2**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature was 98.7?????
?, blood pressure 140/80, heart rate in the 100-110s and irregular, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 95% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cells 6.9, hematocrit 37.9, platelet count 172; CHEM7 with a sodium of 131, potassium 4.2, chloride 90, bicarb 29, BUN 15, creatinine 0.7, glucose 390; INR 5.6; digoxin level 0.6.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 100, right bundle branch block, poor R-wave progression.
There were no significant changes compared to electrocardiogram performed on [**2145-2-28**].
A repeat hematocrit was checked, and this was 30.
Her heart rate increased to the 160s, and while she with good mental status, it was felt that she was at hight risk for becoming hemodynamically unstable; therefore, she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Tagged red cell scans were performed, and neither of these were diagnostic.
A colonoscopy was recommended to visualize the possible source of the GI bleed, and because the patient became anxious and went into respiratory distress during the bowel prep for this procedure, it was not reattempted.
In the end it was felt that since the patient had colonoscopy only one year ago that had documented the diverticular disease, it was felt that a repeat colonoscopy would be poor yield unless she were to actively rebleed.
Her rate was well controlled with this dose and ranged from 75 to 90.
given that her blood pressure was also well controlled with her Cardizem.
Hematology:  The patient's goal INR is 2.5-3.5 given her atrial valve replacement with a St. Jude's valve, as well as her atrial fibrillation.
She was admitted supratherapeutic with an INR of 5.8.
This should be continued until her INR reaches 2.5.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient received TPN while she was intubated on the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
q.d., her goal INR is 2.5-3.5, this should be followed closely while she is an outpatient, Lovenox 80 mg subcue b.i.d.
until her INR is therapeutic, Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
