His neurological exam declined overnight, and a repeat CT Scan 0400 [**8-20**] demonstrated hemorrhagic conversion of stroke.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Head CT [**8-21**]: HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no significant change in right-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the right occipital parietotemporal lobe.
ECHO [**8-22**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2160-8-22**] FINDINGS: There is a large right parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 6.7 x 3.5 cm with persistent perihemorrhagic edema and mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
If there is high clinical concern for intra-articular derangement, MRI could be performed when the patient is more stable.
In the overnight hours of [**8-20**], he hand an abrupt MS change and a CT scan was performed, which showed hemorrhagic conversion.
He had an elevated WBC count of 14.7 but this normalized and no active infection was detected.
