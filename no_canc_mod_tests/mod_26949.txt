Urine: Creatinine, Urine 147 mg/dL Total Protein, Urine 249 mg/dL Protein/Creatinine Ratio 1.7* Ratio 0 - .2 .
Electrophoresis, Urine  +/- MULTIPLE PROTEIN BANDS SEEN, WITH ALBUMIN PREDOMINATING' Immunofixation, Urine - NO MONOCLONAL IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEEN, NEGATIVE FOR BENCE-[**Doctor Last Name **] PROTEIN .
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2172-1-22**]):       PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.
ECG ([**11-20**]): Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature beats.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**11-20**]):  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale, color, and spectral Doppler analysis of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed.
TTE ([**11-21**]): 1.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast ([**11-21**]): 1.
BLADDER ULTRASOUND STUDY ([**11-24**]):  Numerous images of the bladder demonstrate a diffusely abnormal wall with irregular thickness and contour, predominantly on the anterior aspect.
Given the appearance of the wall, a cystoscopy is recommended to exclude malignancy.
CT head without contrast ([**11-26**]): FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
TTE ([**12-26**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 60-70%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-11-22**], contractile function of the right ventricle is now normal.
Urine cytology ([**1-12**]): NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Red blood cells.
Cystoscopy ([**1-24**]): (per Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 825**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] note) 3+ trabeculated bladder.
He was continued on heparin, started on IV fluids, and transferred to the CCU given evidence of heart failure on echo (EF 25%, RV dysfunction).
He will continue lovenox until reaches goal INR [**1-25**] at which time coumadin can be discontinued.
Further hypercoagulability evaluation deferred to outpatient.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient will need daily INR checks until therapeutic on coumadin at which time lovenox can be discontinued.
Repeat urine culture grew pseudomonas resistant to quinolones and MRSA.
He failed two voiding trials the week prior to discharge and therefore an indwelling foley was left in place with urology followup for urodynamics studies and consideration of TURP.
Concern was for malignancy, however urine cytology was negative and the patient underwent cystoscopy on [**2172-1-24**] which revealed no evidence of malignancy.
Abdominal/pelvic CT was notable for a thickened bladder wall and further followed up with a bladder US that confirmed the finding.
Urine cytology and cystoscopy was negative.
Chest CT at presentation showed bibasilar nodular densities in the setting of bilat PEs, and repeat study revealed that these had completely resolved.
#) Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 222 on arrival, and noted slow downward progression during initial hospital course with nadir in low 100s.
Did not appear to meet trends for either Type I or II HIT; HIT antibody was sent and was negative.
Upon arrival, echocardiogram initially with EF 25% and RV dysfunction likely [**1-24**] PE, so ACEi and BB were initiated for presumed cardiomyopathy.
Repeat echo was performed after acute events resolved and showed preserved EF with normal wall motion.
Abdomen/pelvis CT scan with large amount of bowel in hernia sac.
