Then, at 10 p.m. one day prior to admission, she became more lethargic, and her blood pressure dropped to 60/palpable (usually 130s/90s).
On arrival, her blood pressure was 215/131.
The patient became hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 80% and a respiratory rate of 20.
A respiratory rate dropped to 26 and became agonal.
White blood cell count was 36.2.
A chest x-ray revealed no infiltrates seen.
An arterial blood gas was drawn and revealed pH was 7.19, CO2 was 88, and oxygen was 106.
The patient's tracheostomy was attached to the ventilation, and on ventilation the arterial blood gas improved to a pH of 7.36, CO2 of 50, and oxygen of 318; however, her blood pressure dropped to the 70s with no response to wide-open fluids.
An arterial line was placed on the day of admission as well.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed temperature was 102.6, blood pressure was 157/115, heart rate was 97, respiratory rate was 19, and oxygen saturation was 70%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the mucous membranes were moist.
The neck examination revealed a tracheostomy with no erythema or exudate.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia.
Lung examination revealed very shallow quick breaths and a few scattered bronchial sounds.
Extremity examination revealed extremities were warm.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 36.2, hematocrit was 44.4, and platelets were 562.
Electrolytes revealed sodium was 131, potassium was 4.6, chloride was 91, bicarbonate was 31, blood urea nitrogen was 16, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was 155.
Urinalysis revealed large amounts of blood, 500 mg/dL of protein, and moderate leukocytes, more than 50 red blood cells, more than 50 white blood cells, a few bacteria, and no yeast.
Microbiology history:  In [**2101-10-11**], there was a urine cultures which grew out Pseudomonas which was sensitive to everything but ciprofloxacin (which it was resistant to).
In [**2100**], urine culture grew out pan-sensitive enterococcus.
In [**2099**], urine culture grew out ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, cefuroxime intermediate and Pseudomonas resistant to ciprofloxacin.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING: A chest x-ray revealed a left lower lobe streak ?.
Electrocardiogram revealed no acute ST-T wave changes per baseline.
HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  Hypotension most likely due to urosepsis with a urinalysis showing a high white blood cells and moderate leukocyte esterase with a white blood cell count of 36.2.
Urinalysis showed signs of urinary tract infection.
Urine culture from the [**7-29**] grew out enterococcus pan-sensitive to ampicillin, levofloxacin, and vancomycin.
Urosepsis resolving, and the patient was afebrile throughout her hospital course.
White blood cell count dropped to 13.4.
There was a question of a fistula in the urinary system; however, Urology was consulted and upon the methylene blue study there was found to be no vesicovaginal fistula.
Additionally, Clostridium difficile was negative times two; taken from stool cultures.
Additionally, sputum from [**7-29**] grew out Pseudomonas sensitive to everything but ciprofloxacin.
Other electrolytes were repleted as needed; such as phosphate and magnesium.
