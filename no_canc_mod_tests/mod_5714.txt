The rest of the lungs are unremarkable but note is made that the right lateral chest wall and the right lateral lung were not included in the field of view.
Residual contrast within the bladder identified on the pre-contrast images, likely from the lumbar spine MR examination performed on [**2183-6-7**] at an outside institution.
The presence of contrast on this examination from [**2183-6-7**] suggests impaired excretion of gadolinium from the body.
Presence of intra-articular gadolinium on the pre-contrast sequences indicates retention and excretion of contrast which was administered for a previous MR examination on [**2183-6-9**].
Please note that the patient has had three MRIs with intravenous gadolinium in the span of three days (at 2 different institutions), and the presence of intra- articular gadolinium on the current study (and in the urinary bladder on the pre-contrast images from the previous study) suggests renal impairment and decreased clearance of gadolinium.
Correlation with patient's creatinine levels and consideration of dialysis is recommended.
MRI cannot distinguish between edema related to post-surgical changes and edema related to infection.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2183-6-10**] no diagnostic interim change.
CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2183-6-14**] 4:43 PM CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the imaged lung bases, there are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
CT OF PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: In the pelvis, the sigmoid is dilated and the wall thickened with perisigmoid fat opacification suggestive of proctitis.
Diskitis/osteomyelitis at L1-L2.
The gallbladder is distended with a large amount of sludge; however, there is no wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign to suggest acute cholecystitis.
DUPLEX EXAMINATION OF THE LIVER: There is hepatopetal flow within the main, right, and left portal veins as well as normal flow within the main, right, left, and middle hepatic veins.
The main, right, and left hepatic arteries maintain brisk arterial upstroke and preserved diastolic flow.
Cirrhosis, splenomegaly, and no significant ascites.
An MRI is recommended when the patient is clinically stable.
See ECHO above showing 1+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 18**], all blood cultures were negative with the exception of one bottle growing coag negative staph, presumably a contaminant.
He underwent an MRI of his pelvis and right knee as he was complaining of some pain in that area looking for further sites of hematogenous spread which was negative.
He will need a vancomycin trough level drawn after his third dose of 750 mg IV daily, which is being started upon discharge to rehab.
Urine Na 18, he is not significantly decompensated hepatically, and his BP is not low (as it would be with splancnic vasodilation, thus less likely hepatorenal.
His creatinine peaked at 2.2 and improved to 2.0 upon discharge.
Serial exams throughout his stay were stable.
His INR peaked at 3.2.
His HCT was stable for the last several days in the mid 20s.
He will need a CBC drawn biweekly and will need transfusions for symptoms or HCT < 23.
There was also a singular nodule which was consistent with HCC per radiographic studies as above.
Nodule in liver consistent with HCC by CT with contrast.
He is being discharged on PO lasix, which should be titrated according to his fluid status, renal function, and blood pressure.
His blood glucose remained in the 100s for several days before discharge.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 100 % Powder Sig: One (1) gram PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Fentanyl 75 mcg/hr Patch 72 hr Sig: One (1) patch Transdermal Q72H (every 72 hours): please apply with other 50mcg patch.
