Imaging: CXR [**9-24**]: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
_______________________________ CT HEAD [**9-25**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect.
____________________________ MRI Lumbar Spine [**9-27**]: Vertebral body height, alignment, and signal intensity are normal.
_________________________ MRI Thoracic Spine [**9-27**]: The study is technically limited due to extreme patient motion and is suboptimal for adequate evaluation of the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Technically limited and suboptimal study for adequate evaluation of the thoracic spine.
Possible abnormalities as described above need repeat imaging for adequate interpretation.
________________________ EKG [**9-28**]: Regular narrow complex tachycardia - may be sinus tachycardia but consider also atrial flutter with 2:1 response Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes No previous tracing for comparison _______________________ ECHO [**9-29**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
_______________________ CT OF THE ABDOMEN [**9-29**]: The imaged portions of the lung bases are clear with no opacities, effusions, or nodules identified.
The gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen all appear normal.
_____________________ CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**9-29**]: The appendix is abnormally thick with a diameter up to 7.6 mm.
_____________________ Repeat CT Abdomen and Pelvis [**9-30**]: normal contrast filling the apendix, no acute change.
The patient was initially admitted to the regular medical floor, vital sings were Tmax 102; Tc 98.8; P 62; RR 18; BP 94/56.
Meningitis/Fever - Patient's history, physical exam, and LP results from the OSH and repeated at [**Hospital1 18**] were concerning for bacterial meningitis with very high opening pressures, although the time course was somewhat more prolonged than would be expected for a bacterial process.
Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin were discontinued once CSF cultures from the OSH came back negative.
Acyclovir was later discontinued as CSF HSV 1 and 2 came back negative.
Repeat LP was performed as per ID recommendations which again showed a lymphocytic predominance with decreasing levels of protein and increasing glucose.
Droplet precautions and negative pressure isolation was discontinued as the patient has no signs or symptoms or active TB.
MRI of the head was also performed which did not reveal any evidence of TB or other abnormalities.
No source of infection was immediately apparent, so, since patient is at an increased risk for DVT (due to LE paraplegia), bilateral LENIs were ordered and were negative for DVT bilaterally.
MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine revealed leptomeningeal enhancement of the conus medullaris and cauda equina in the setting of diffuse meningeal irritation.
CT of the abdomen/pelvis did not reveal any involvement of the paraspinal musculature or soft tissues.
Abdominal x-ray did not reveal any free air or obstruction.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with oral and IV contrast which showed a filling defect in the appendix with a thickened wall suggestive of appendicitis.
Surgery consult was placed who recommended repeat imaging of the abdomen due to the suboptimal quality of the first study which did not show filling of the cecum.
The patient remained without an acute abdomen throughout, WBC count was steadily decreasing, fever curve decreasing.
Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis however showed a normal filling appendix, appendicitis was ruled out and surgery team signed off.
Patient complained of inability to pass urine, the foley was placed back in and 750cc of urine came out while abdominal pain resolved.
Tachycardia - The patient was in sinus tachycardia beginning [**9-27**] which persisted and reached a maximum HR of 160s.
The patient responded appropriately to several fluid boluses of NS which caused his HR to come down to the 60s.
The patient continued to match his urine input and output and was able to tolerate aggressive fluids without any problems.
Notably, the patient's heart rate decreased during sleep and increased during the daytime, likely as a result of anxiety.
However, patient has a h/o of urinary retention while being in in the hospital, so he should be evaluated for urine output frequently.
Cerebral salt wasting: Initially the patient was thought to have SIADH with low serum sodium levels likely due to his underlying CNS infection.
A trial of fluid restriction however failed to normalize the patient's sodium level.
24h urinary sodium secretion was above normal suggesting cerebral salt wasting as the cause for his low sodium.
Patient sodium normalized (135) being the last [**Location (un) 1131**], while taking in POs.
Serum electrolytes were monitored carefully.
As mentioned above, serum sodium levels decreased to a low of 129 but increased to normal limits with normal saline and salt tabs.
