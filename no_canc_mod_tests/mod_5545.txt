Flu PNA at the VA in [**12-19**] and had been at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 21079**] Rehab for 2 days and today developed shortness of breath, decreased oxygen saturation to 80% and RLQ pain, taken to [**Location (un) 24356**] ED and then transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
In the ED, the patient was in moderate respiratory distress, 80% room air oxygen saturation and was put on NRB with sats of 100%, ABG on NRB was 7.24/87/139 and had RLQ fullness.
The patient's repeat gas was 7.29/74/50 and he was placed on 100% O2.
He was initally felt to have pulmonary edema and given 60mg Lasix IV prior to arrival and placed on a nitro drip for 1 hour which was stopped after his pressure decreased.
CT abd showed large rectus sheath hematoma but not dissection or retroperitoneal bleeding.
Hx Lung Ca - [**2187**]; details of tx unavailable 5.
Recurrent hip fx- last [**6-18**] 7.
Anemia - Hct at bl 31-35  Social History: Patient is retired, normally lives with his wife but has been in rehab for the last 2 days.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T= 97.2, HR = 112 afib, BP = 105/56, AC, 600 TV, 12 RR, PEEP 5 , SaO2 = 100% General: Shivering elderly male, NAD.
Chest: chest rose and fell with equal size, shape and symmetry, lungs had clear BS ant.
Pertinent Results: CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: sbo, colitis, hernia Field of view: 39 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man with abdominal pain, distended abdomen REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: sbo, colitis, hernia CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 80-year-old with abdominal pain and a distended abdomen with an abdominal wall mass, question incarcerated hernia.
TECHNIQUE: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.
150 cc of Optiray was used for this examination due to patient history of debility.
CT ABDOMEN W/IV CONTRAST  There are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals, and kidneys are unremarkable in appearance.
Dense calcification is seen at the ostia of both the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, though contrast is seen within both of these arteries.
CT PELVIS W/IV CONTRAST  The rectum is distended with stool.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images significantly aided in the evaluation of the above findings and confirmed the above findings.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 24357**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24358**] Approved: SAT [**2194-2-15**] 11:36 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: r/o PNA  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 79 year old man with fever, recent pna with respiratory distress.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name **]  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval for infact, limited study for bleed given that he alrea  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man with resp failure, known aortic thrombi and mental status changes REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for infact, limited study for bleed given that he already received IV contrast for CTA of chest.
Please note that the patient received IV contrast prior to the examination for performance of additional CT.
FINDINGS:  CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The examination is somewhat limited by the patient motion.
IMPRESSION:  Limited examination due to the patient motion and previous administration of IV contrast.
SUN  CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST  Reason: r/o PE and f/u ulcerated aortic arch thrombosis Contrast: VISAPAQUE  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 79 year old man with h/o lung cancer now with resp distress and A-a gradient.
COMPARISON: [**2194-1-30**]  TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained through the lungs prior to and following the administration of intravenous Visipaque.
CONTRAST: Intravenous nonionic, low osmolar contrast was administered due to the patient's debility as well as due to the previous contrast load from CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast performed on the same date.
FINDINGS:  CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in place.
There are scattered peripheral nonspecific nodular opacities within the right lower lobe (series 3, image 48 and image 44), unchanged from previous examination.
Multiplanar reformats: Multiplanar reformatted images demonstrate no evidence of filling defect within the pulmonary defect within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus.
SUN DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 24357**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24358**]  Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo male with past medical history significant for lung cancer, COPD, recent H. Flu pneumonia, and recent new-onset atrial fibrillation now admitted with mental status changes, respiratory failure, and rapid atrial fibrillation.
