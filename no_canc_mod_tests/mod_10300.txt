HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (status post myocardial infarction in [**2161**] and status post right coronary artery stent), rheumatic heart disease (with 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation, moderate mitral stenosis with a valve area of 0.9 cm2 and a gradient of 11 mmHg), congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 20% to 25%), atrial fibrillation (status post biventricular pacemaker placement but not cardioverted due to left atrial clot seen on [**2167-7-19**] and [**2167-9-18**] transesophageal echocardiograms).
Her Coumadin was held as her INR was supracervical at 4.7.
She was started on dopamine and dobutamine and transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.
Cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, severe mitral regurgitation, and mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic fever.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Examination on admission revealed the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 97.4, heart rate was 104, blood pressure ranged from 96 to 108/62 to 70, respiratory rate was 35.
Her lungs had decreased breath sounds; particularly at the right base, with dullness to percussion and diffuse rales.
Her heart examination revealed normal first heart sound and second heart sound with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur with a diastolic soft component.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories at the time of admission revealed white blood cell count was 15.1, hematocrit was 39.3, and platelets were 262.
INR was 4.6.
Chemistry-7 was unremarkable except for a bicarbonate of 19, a blood urea nitrogen of 22, and creatinine of 1.
INR was repeated at the time of arrival which was 3.4.
Shortly thereafter she had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed elevated filling pressures with pulmonary artery filling pressures of 60/35, and a wedge pressure of 30.
She was tried on multiple combinations of pressors including dopamine, dobutamine, Milrinone, and Natrecor; none of which effectively increased her renal perfusion and urine output nor her cardiac output and index.
Her white blood cell count was increasing; reaching a peak of 29.
Cultures were sent including sputum, blood cultures, and urine cultures.
Sputum cultures ultimately grew out Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The urine cultures had gram-negative rods which were not yet typed at the time of this dictation.
The patient developed septic physiology with a transient increase in her cardiac output and a decrease in her systemic vascular resistance.
Her liver function tests continued to climb with her transaminases reaching near 200, and her total bilirubin reaching a peak of 8.2.
The cultures from the fluid grew no organisms, and this appeared to be exudative; likely a parapneumonic effusion.
By this time, her pressors were changed to Levophed and Vasopressin to maintain blood pressures.
