At rehab her  initial weight was 203lbs.
At that time her creatinine was also noted to be rising (1.8 to 2.2).
As BP was not fluid responsive she was started on dopamine and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Smoked 2 PPD for 20 years.

TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-3-4**], the aortic valve has been replaced with a well functioning bioprosthesis.
Left ventricular systolic function is similar.
She was restarted on home diabetic medications and had episode of hypoglycemia without any mental status changes and treated with intravenous dextrose including drip and oral agents and insulin stopped [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations.
