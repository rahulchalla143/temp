An abdominal CT was obtained showing multiple loops of dilated bowel with transition point within the right lower quadrant approximately 10-15 cm upstream from the end-ileostomy.
Upon admission there was minimal stool output or gas in the ostomy bag, however over the course of the next 24 hours, stool output increased significantly, and NGT drainage dropped off.
Ostomy output decreased to 200 cc for the day, and the NG tube was replaced.
PRBC,FFP, albumiun, and 8L crystalloid were administered.
TTE was done to evaluate fluid status (decreased urine output) as he did not have central access.
EF was >75 and LV was hyperdynamic.
He received IV fluid with improved urine output.
Hct remained stable after blood products.
VS and labs were stable.
UA was nl, urine culture was pending.
Blood cultures were sent.
The bilirubin continued to rise and peaked at 9.6 on [**7-1**].
In response to the worsening LFTs, on [**6-28**] a transjugular liver biopsy was performed.
He tolerated the procedure without incident, liver biopsy results showed Bile ductular proliferation with associated neutrophils and mild to moderate intrahepatocytic and canalicular cholestasis, there was no evidence of acute rejection.
An HCV Viral load was sent showing a result of 743,239 IU/mL.
(The viral load in [**2152-2-13**] was 1,170,000 IU/mL).
On [**6-30**], as follow-up to CT done a day earlier, the patient underwent placement of two new drains, which were in response to new areas of fluid concerning for abscess.

Gram stain and culture isolated 1 colony of Enterococcus.
On [**7-11**], CT demonstrated a new LUQ collection.
On [**7-17**], he was made NPO as LUQ drain (#3)amylase and bilirubin were 6174 and 8.4 which was consistent with a bowel leak.
On [**2152-8-20**] his repsiratory requirements on the vent were increasing and he was on 100% FiO2 with 14 PEEP.
He developed an increased pressor requirement that same day and was found to have cardiac tamponade and had a pericardial drain placed.
