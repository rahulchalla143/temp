Prenatal screens included blood type B negative, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis surface antigen negative, and group B strep positive.
Intrapartum course was notable for adequate antibiotic prophylaxis, fetal tachycardia, and failure to progress during labor.
At delivery, the infant emerged vigorous with Apgar scores [**8-4**].
She was seen in the NICU for a sepsis evaluation due to the fetal tachycardia, with an unremarkable CBC, and was then admitted to the newborn nursery.
An IV was placed and phenobarbital given, with eventual cessation of the seizure after 10-15 minutes.
Her birth weight was 2,820 grams.
Her birth length 48.5 cm and birth head circumference 34 cm.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her admission physical examination revealed an active, full-term appearing newborn.
Her weight at the time of discharge is 2,820 grams.
Of note, blood chemistries including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous, and blood glucose were measured as part of the seizure evaluation, and these were all normal.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Initial liver function tests were measured as part of the seizure evaluation, and were mildly elevated with values of:  ALT 419, AST 390, alkaline phosphatase 120, bilirubin 4.1/0.2.
Follow-up LFTs were improved on [**2181-5-25**] with values of ALT 386, AST 229, alkaline phosphatase 114, and bilirubin 6.2/0.3.
Repeat bilirubin on [**5-27**] prior to discharge was 3.4/0.2.
HEMATOLOGY: Her hematocrit at the time of admission was 45.7, platelets 242,000.
Her blood type is B positive.
Coagulation studies were sent on [**5-23**] due to minor bleeding at the time of initial venipuncture; these were normal.
CBC was unremarkable, and blood culture was sent.
A lumbar puncture was performed with unremarkable CSF cell count and differential.
Her blood culture and cerebral spinal culture remained negative.
Her cerebral spinal fluid was sent for herpes PCR which was also negative.
A surface culture for HSV was also sent on [**5-25**], and this is no growth to date by the time of discharge.
An extensive evaluation for the etiology of the seizures was performed in consultation with the Neurology service from [**Hospital3 1810**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
This included serum chemistries (normal), serum ammonia (normal, initial 70, repeat 45), serum lactate (mildly elevated at 4.4, likely insignificant), blood and CSF bacterial cultures (negative), CSF HSV PCR (negative), and surface HSV cultures (no growth at time of discharge).
Serum amino acids were sent, returning with minor abnormalities in glutamic acid (58, normal 62-620), glutamine (976, normal 376-709), citruline (6, normal 10-45), and leucine (43, 48-160).
In the setting of normal ammonia level, these are most likely to be insignificant; a repeat serum amino acid panel was sent on [**5-27**], and is pending at discharge.
Other evaluations included an EEG on [**5-23**], which showed no seizure activity and a normal background, with mildly prominent sharp waves from left side.
A head CT on [**5-23**] was normal.
A head MRI on [**5-24**], performed at [**Hospital1 18**] and read by a neuroradiologist from [**Hospital1 **], was notable for normal T1 and T2 images, but areas of restricted diffusion on the DWI images on the left side, primarily in the left frontal area.
Initial phenobarb level on [**5-24**] was 21.6, and repeat was 26.5 on the day of discharge.
Recommendation per neurology is to maintain a level of approximately 20-25; a repeat serum level 1 week after discharge is recommended.
AUDIOLOGY: A hearing screen was performed with automated auditory brain stem responses.
Her state newborn screen was sent on [**2181-5-23**].
Tests pending at discharge include urine organic acids, repeat serum amino acids, and CSF amino and organic acids and CSF lactate and pyruvate.
