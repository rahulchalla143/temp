Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The maximum gradient across the valve was 16 mmHg with a mean of 7 mmHg at a cardiac output of about 4.5 liters/minute.
