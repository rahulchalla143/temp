Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with 2 drug eluting stents to left anterior descending artery   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 85934**] is a 46 year old male with hypertension and hyperlipidemia but no coronary history who has had chest pain on and off for the past year over the left percordium.
EKG showed NSR 76 bpm, < [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in II and III, no t wave inversions.
He had an echo which was normal with LVEF 70%.
He was found to have troponin I of 2.06, and was started on heparin gtt, atorvastatin, metoprolol, quinapril, and omeprazole and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.
Vital signs were stable on transfer.
Here, he underwent cardiac catheterization which showed: 3 vessel disease with a 85% long lesion in the LAD, a distal 60% LCx lesion, and total proximal PDA occlusion with collaterals from the LAD.
He also complained of back pain and had blood pressure in the 200s.
There was concern for dissection so he was admitted to the CCU for monitoring.
Upon arriving to the floor the patient is comfortable with 1/10 chest discomfort and blood pressures 120s/70s.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated central aortic pressures of 149/98 mmHg.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
He was taken for cardiac catheterization and was found to have 3 vessel disease.
An echo was performed that showed EF of 70%.
The initial concern was for aortic dissection because of the back pain in the setting of hypertension to the 200s so the patient was admitted to the CCU for further monitoring and management.
However when the patient reached the ICU he was comfortable, with blood pressures in the 120s (symmetrically on both arms).
* Hypertensive urgency/Emergency:  Following his catheterization and stents, Mr. [**Known lastname 85934**] was found to have BP 200 along with chest and back discomfort.
His blood pressure remained well controlled in the 120s.
* Hyperlipidemia:  The patient's lipid profile revealed elevated lipids with LDL 171, HDL 31, tryglycerides 258, and total cholesterol 254.
He should have his LFT's and lipid panel rechecked in 6 weeks.
There were no complications and the echocardiogram shwed that your heart function is unchanged.
Start Lisinopril to lower your blood pressure and help your heart heal.
Start Metoprolol to lower your heart rate and help prevent another heart attack.
