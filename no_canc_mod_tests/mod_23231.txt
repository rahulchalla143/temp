In OSH, his Hct dropped from 31 -->25 (baseline ~ 38).
His bleeding persisted in small amounts and then he put out 200 cc of blood at 3 pm and 300 cc at 6:30 pm on [**2152-5-30**].
A tagged RBC scan on [**5-31**] revealed bleeding in the mid to distal descending colon.

Colonoscopy [**6-2**]: There was blood throughout colon but given fresh blood seen in the sigmoid colon the source of the bleed is most likely a left sided diverticulum.
Continue to follow serial hcts and transfuse for goal hct> 30 If bleeding continues will need to consider L hemicolectomy.
Tagged RBC scan [**6-4**]: IMPRESSION: No active GI bleeding at the time of study  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 80 M w h/o DM, HTN who p/w BRBPR, likely [**2-3**] to diverticula with no source identified on colonoscopy or angio.
Tagged RBC scan at OSH showed bleeding in the distal colon and his hct trended down from 30 to 25 there per report.
Overnight he started having melena and his hct began to trend down.
On [**6-2**] he had a colonoscopy which showed multiple diverticula, which were thought to be the source of bleeding, but the source of the bleed was not able to be identified.
A tagged RBC scan was done to help dilineate where the bleeding was, but the scan did not show a source for bleeding.
An abdominal CT was also done to r/o RP bleed, after angio in the setting of dropping hcts.
The CT was negative for bleed.
His hct remained stable and he did not require further transfusions, and was subsequently transferred to the floor.
His hematocrit remained stable.
However, his pressures were significantly elevated, so he was started on a small dose of an ACEI.
When his bleeding stopped his ACEI was uptitrated and a BB was added to his regimen, with better control of his pressures.
While on the floor the patient's blood pressure was stable on captopril and lopressor.
