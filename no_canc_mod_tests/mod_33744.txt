His blood pressure on admission to the OSH was 147/67 but reportedly was up to SBP 180.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
At [**Hospital1 18**], his bp was 157/87 on admission, and in the ED he was given Dilantin 1 gm IV x1, Hydralazine 5 mg IV x1, and Nicardipine gtt.
CTA head/neck at [**Hospital1 18**] showed large right frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with other scattered smaller adjacent intraparenchymal hemorrhages identified.
This showed a developmental venous anomaly in the right frontal region in the demonstrated area of hemorrhage as seen on CT and CTA, and no evidence for aneurysm/AVM associated with this.
He was started on Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg PO tid for blood pressure control.
FLP Chol: 122, TG 59, HDL 26, LDL 84, CEs: CK 40-40, TropT <0.01x2, HgA1c 5.4%, serum/urine tox negative.
His strength on the left side continued to improve during the hospitalization, and at the time of discharge was: Right: Full, Left: Delt 4, [**Hospital1 **] 4+, Tri 4+, WE 5, FE 5, IP 4-, H 3, Q 3, PF 1, DF 1.
He was also found to have a microcytic anemia (Hct 36-39), but iron studies showed  Fe 64, TIBC 329, ferritin 81.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 17921**] Center - [**Location (un) 5450**], NH  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Frontal-Parietal hemorrhagic stroke, likely due to DVA (developmental venous anomaly) Microcytic anemia   Discharge Condition: Weakness of left deltoids, biceps triceps, IP, hamstrings, quadriceps, PF, and DF, but much improved from admission   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to this hospital because you could not move the left side of your body.
You had a cerebral angiogram that did not reveal an aneurysm but did show a venous malformation that could have caused the bleeding.
