In this setting patient underwent CTA chest on [**7-30**] which showed no evidence for PE, but did show atelectasis and large left sided effusion which appeared as an unchanged effusion .
During the same timeframe the patient experienced a dramatic drop in his oxygen saturations from high 90s down to 75% which improved once he was placed on 5L O2 via NC.
He had a BP 174/84, HR 120 RR26 at this time and was c/o SOB.
BP peaked at 192/84 and RR increased to 38.
ABG was pH 7.12/103/87 and patient placed on BIPAP 25/5 with 60% FiO2, he then became hypotensive and got IVFs to restore his BP.
He recovered and was placed on NC with oxygen sats returning to 90s.
Noteable studies: He had CXR which showed no signs massive aspiration but atelectasis on LLL and additional Chest CT showed left pleural effusion.
