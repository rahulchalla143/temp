The LCx had a tiny OM1, a modest caliber OM2 with diffuse plaquing distally, and a patent (large) OM3 and OM4.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed low-normal systemic arterial pressures, with a central aortic pressure of 104/58, mean 77 mmHg.
[**2104-4-19**] Chest CT Scan: 1.
[**2104-4-19**] Renal Ultrasound: The right kidney measures 10.7 cm and left kidney measures 10.9 cm.
[**2104-4-19**] Abdominal Ultrasound: There is a 3 x 2.8 cm hypoechoic lesion in the posterior left lobe of the liver, which is incompletely evaluated and of indeterminate etiology.
The first step in the operation was to remove the wire, which left 1 - 2+ TR.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
There is an aortic homograft in place with no AI, no leak and a residual peak gradient of 6 mmHg.
[**2104-4-22**] Head CT Scan: There is an approximately 1.9 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe with surrounding edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital6 16029**] with shortness of breath and low grade fever, blood cultures positive for coagulase negative staphylcoccus, and an aortic valve vegetation with root involvement.
Head CT revealed left occipital hemorrhage concerning for underlying mycotic aneurysm.
Recommendations were made for blood pressure parameters as well as to continued antibiotics.
Additional labs were sent.
Endoscopy was deferred.
The evening of [**5-1**] the patient had new fever and hypotension concerning for new infection and CT showed large anterior pleural collection.
On [**5-2**] he had IR guided drainage (per report appeared to be old blood) with cultures negative and clinical improvement after drainage.
Urine output picked up and CVVH was discontinued briefly.
CT Torso showed bilateral pleural effusions and continued, but smaller anterior mediastinal collection.
TEE on [**5-15**] did not reveal any valvular vegetation, abscess or pericardial effusion.
He did not respond to any aspect of neurological exam including cough, gag, corneal reflex or noxious stimuli.
