He went to his primary care physician's office where an electrocardiogram showed anterior ST segment elevations.
At the time his vital signs showed a blood pressure of 184/92, pulse 93 and O2 sats around 94%.
In the Emergency Department an electrocardiogram showed 1 to [**Street Address(2) 15827**] elevations in leads V2 through V4.
His catheterization showed single vessel coronary artery disease and an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Blood pressure 141/83.
Pulse 60.
Respiratory rate 18.
Satting 98% on room air.
Pulmonary clear to auscultation equal bilaterally.
Neurological examination cranial nerves II through XII are intact.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 8.5, hematocrit 33.5, platelets 298, BUN 25, creatinine 1.2, blood glucose 372.
Chest x-ray questionable right middle lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram from admission normal sinus rhythm with left axis, ST elevations of 2 to 3 mm in leads V2 through V6.
He went to emergent cardiac catheterization, which showed 100% stenosis of his mid left anterior descending coronary artery.
His initial CK was 618.
It then peaked 1686 with a peak troponin of 7.02.
His enzymes subsequently trended down following cardiac catheterization.
His lipids and liver function tests were checked and he was started on a statin.
He was also started on a low dose beta blocker and ace inhibitor, which were titrated up as tolerated throughout the hospitalization.
The patient remained stable following catheterization and had no subsequent ischemic or anginal symptoms.
The patient remained stable following catheterization with close monitoring in the Coronary Care Unit and echocardiogram was obtained the day after admission to assess his wall functioning following his acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.
His echocardiogram showed that his ventricular systolic function was significantly impaired as compared with a previous echocardiogram from [**2177**].
Echocardiogram showed multiple wall motion abnormalities including anteroseptal, anterior and apical akinesis.
He was started on Lovenox for anticoagulation given his wall motion abnormalities with plans for a follow up echocardiogram in approximately one month.
Valve, the patient had an echocardiogram, which showed mild mitral regurgitation.
He did have a short episode of ventricular tachycardia the day following his myocardial infarction, which was thought to represent reperfusion.
His blood sugar at admission was markedly elevated at 372.
The patient was started on a regular insulin regimen with good control of his blood sugars.
He also received teaching on blood glucose monitoring and insulin injections.
His creatinine function subsequently stabilized and had returned to his baseline at the time of discharge.
