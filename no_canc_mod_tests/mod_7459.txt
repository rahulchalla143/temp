The patient was referred by his primary care physician for outpatient stress test and cardiac catheterization.
He also underwent an exercise tolerance test on [**2113-4-28**], which showed anginal-type symptoms with probable ischemic electrocardiogram changes.
On [**2113-4-24**], he also had an echocardiogram which showed moderate aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function.
A note from this echocardiogram was that based on the [**2109**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis guidelines, that the echocardiogram findings from this test indicated a moderate risk, and that he should receive prophylaxis in the future.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2113-5-4**], which showed pulmonary artery pressures systolic between 32 and 56, and diastolic between 18 and 26.
The aortic pressures were 190/70.
The left ventricular pressures were 210/28.
He was also found to have an ejection fraction of 65%, 70% stenosis of the left main, and 2-vessel disease.
Indication for this was aortic stenosis and cardiac catheterization results as well as worsening angina.
The patient was stable and the balloon pump was removed, and he was transferred to the floor on postoperative day two, and on postoperative day three the patient was transfused with 2 units secondary a hematocrit of 19.8.
With that hematocrit he was also complaining of some dizziness, and this was making ambulating difficult.
However, gradually worked with Physical Therapy and was ambulating around the hallway with assistance, and his hematocrit on discharge was 26 and steadily rising.
