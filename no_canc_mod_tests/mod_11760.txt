Her AST was 101, and her amylase was 195.
Chest x-ray on admission was clear.
A CT scan of her abdomen showed a fatty liver, diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with areas of decreased enhancement, presenting the question of necrosis, moderate fat surrounding, and no fluid collection.
Her temperature at that point was 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
Her pulse was 161.
Her blood pressure was 144/87, and her respiratory rate was 38.
A chest x-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates.
An arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.33, PCO2 of 37, and PO2 of 39.
She had a right atrial pressure of 19, pulmonary artery pressure of 98/31, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25.
She was given an additional 100 mg of Lasix intravenously and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
Gravida 4, para 2; two cesarean sections; spontaneous abortion times one; therapeutic abortion times one.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 101.2 rectally, pulse 106, respiratory rate 22, blood pressure 138/84, oxygen saturation 95% on FIO2 of 100%.
Pulmonary artery pressure of 36/21, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 13, central venous pressure of 13, cardiac output of 4.96.
Ventilator setting assist control ventilation 450 X 18, positive end-expiratory pressure 15, FIO2 1.
The lower extremity pulses were dopplerable.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count of 13.4, hematocrit 32, platelets 286.
Sodium 133, potassium 3.4, chloride 98, bicarbonate 20, blood urea nitrogen 11, creatinine 0.8, glucose of 251.
Calcium 5.3, magnesium 0.9, phosphorous 1.
Creatine kinase was 272, with a MB fraction of 1.2, troponin was negative.
Arterial blood gas on admission revealed pH of 7.33, PCO2 of 37, PO2 of 39 on FIO2 of 1.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 163 beats per minute with T wave flattening in leads V3 through V6, III, and F.  Chest x-ray on admission revealed bilateral upper lobe alveolar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema.
CT of the abdomen revealed fatty infiltration of the liver; normal spleen, adrenals, and kidneys.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed ascites, no gallstones.
By [**2-15**], the ventilator was decreased to minimal pressure support, but the patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial.
A chest x-ray on [**2-17**] revealed a right upper lobe infiltrate and sputum Gram stain showed gram-negative rods.
The patient self-extubated on [**2-24**], and oxygen saturations remained stable thereafter.
Repeat CT scans showed extensive necrosis.
CT-guided pancreatic aspiration was performed on [**2-15**] which grew no organisms in culture.
A repeat CT scan on [**2-22**] showed stable pancreatic necrosis with developing surround pseudocyst without signs of superinfection.
RENAL:  Urine output, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine have been stable throughout the admission.
Blood cultures, fungal isolators, urine cultures, sputum, and Clostridium difficile assays were sent.
A biopsy revealed perivascular lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltrates consistent with drug reaction.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells during her admission, but her hematocrit has remained relatively stable throughout the admission at 25 to 26.
Iron, B12, and folate studies were all within normal limits.
Her fingerstick blood glucoses were monitored, and she was maintained on a regular insulin sliding-scale for new diabetes.
Her electrolytes were stable.
