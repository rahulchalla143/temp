Presented to LGH where a CT head showed a possible frontal contusion vs bleed.
CT C spine showed grade 1 anterolithesis of C6 on C7 by 3mm, no acute fracture.
CXR showed mildly displaced fractures of lateral aspect of L fourth, fifth, sixth ribs.
In the ED a CT of the chest was performed as well as plain films of the T-spine and the left humerus.

This peaked at 0.57 at EKG showed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depression V3-V5.
An echo showed normal function (see pertinent results section).
On the floor her vital signs were routinely monitored and her daily labs were trended.
Her creatinine continued to rise from 1.1 on admission to 1.5 on [**3-14**].
Urine electrolytes were obtained that indicated the patient was prerenal and dry and so she was given a bolus of IV fluids.
On [**2189-3-16**] her respiratory status was stable on minimal nasal cannula and her chest x-ray showed significant improvement in edema (See pertinent results for details).
The nephrology service was consulted for continued rise in creatinine up to 1.9 on [**2189-3-16**].
A renal ultrasound was obtained which showed simple renal cysts but no evidence of renal calculi, hydronephrosis, or mass.
Given that the patient had prior evidence of chronic renal insufficiency with a documented creatinine of 1.6 one year a few months ago and was clinically "dry" on exam, it was recommended that she be given IV fluids at a slow rate in order to rehydrate and avoid pulmonary edema.
Her foley catheter remained in place for urine output monitoring, which remained adequate.
On [**3-18**] her serum creatinine has come down toward baseline of 1.6.
Final renal recommendations were to hold her gemfibrozil until [**3-20**] and recheck her serum creatinine at that point.
If her creatinine is stable on [**3-20**] her gemfibrozil can be restarted at that time.
With this, her oxygen saturation remained within normal limits on minimal nasal cannula supplementation.
Recheck serum creatinine [**3-20**] and restart if creatinine stable at 1.6 or less.
