Prenatal laboratories: blood type is O positive, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune, GBS unknown.
Apgars were 8 and 8 and she was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for prematurity.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight was 1010 gm, less than 5th percentile.
Length was 36 cm, less than 5th percentile and the head circumference was 25.5 cm, also less than 5th percentile.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Infant was hemodynamically stable on admission, without need for blood pressure support.
ECHOs performed over first 2 weeks of life secondary to murmur revealed a PDA that subsequently closed without treatment and a secundum ASD.
Of note, ECHO on [**10-9**] revealed a 1 mm x 3 mm mass on the superior surface of the left atrium, consistent with a thrombus.
This had not been seen on earlier ECHO on [**10-3**], and was thought to be most consistent with a line-related thrombus; at the time, the patient did have  UVC in place which initially had crossed into the left atrium.
The thrombus was followed with serial ECHOs and remained stable.
An abdominal ultrasound on [**10-9**] revealed a small clot in the portal vein but no thrombus in the IVC or aorta.
Last ECHO on [**11-28**] revealed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] to be unchaged in size or appearance, and repeat abdominal ultrasound on [**12-1**] showed portal vein thrombus had resolved.
Of note, ECHO on [**11-28**] did also show a small PDA with high-velocity L to R flow; the PDA had been closed on several earlier ECHOs.
EKG was normal.
An extensive renal evaluation (see below) was negative without concerns for renal dysfunction.
Given that the thrombus was likely line associated, an evaluation for pro-thrombotic disorders was not undertaken.
PT and PTT were measured, and were normal.
If follow-up with hematology is required, referral can be made to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 62243**] at the [**Hospital3 328**], phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62244**] and pager [**Telephone/Fax (1) 47802**].
Hematocrit was followed periodically during admission, with last value of 34.9 with retic count of 5.4% on [**11-28**].
The patient had a maximum bilirubin of 7.2 and 0.3 and she received phototherapy from day of life 2 to 10.
RENAL: Secondary to the 2 vessel cord, renal ultrasound was obtained on [**10-9**], which, other than the portal vein thrombus described above, was normal.
By the time of discharge, blood pressures were stable at approximately 90/40-50; infant never required treatment for hypertension.
Renal service will follow the infant as an outpatient, through the fellow [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 62245**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 51466**] who can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 50498**].
NEUROLOGY: Head ultrasounds were performed.
No particular follow-up other than routine monitoring of development was recommended.
PSYCHOSOCIAL: [**Hospital1 69**] social work was involved with the family.
State newborn screen was normal on the [**10-2**] and [**10-13**].
