A TSH on [**2-20**] was 2.2.
Last PFTs on [**2-26**] showed an FEV1 of 1.08 (60% predicted), FVC of 1.64 (50% predicted).
Last echocardiogram in [**2120-6-5**] showed an ejection fraction of 70%, mild trivial mitral regurgitation, and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
after a Neurontin level of 23 on [**2121-2-20**], Lasix 160 mg q.a.m.
q.h.s., Synthroid 200 mcg q.d., Aspirin 325 mg q.d., Buspar 15 mg t.i.d.
?, blood pressure 118/74, heart rate 58, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 97% on 2 L. General:  She was in no apparent distress.
Jugular venous distention of 12 cm.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 27.7, platelet count 225; sodium 141, potassium 3.2, chloride 98, bicarb 36, BUN 15, creatinine 0.9, glucose 114; the patient's initial CK was 51, troponin less than 0.3; LFTs were normal.
A KUB showed no evidence of obstruction.
Chest x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly with an increase in her known right-sided pleural effusion, as well as upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature and worsening congestive heart failure compared to a study from [**2121-2-27**].
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 60, with normal axis, no ST changes, and no T-wave inversions.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with CKs of 51, 35 and 61, and troponins of less than 0.3.
The patient's initial weight was 216 lbs.
Of note, the patient's creatinine rose form 1.0 to 1.3-1.5, which was thoguht to be acceptable given her diuresis.
As far as her rhythm is concerned, the patient did not receive her regular Dofetilide on the day of admission since her potassium was 3.2.
Her blood pressure was stable, and heart rate was in the low 100s.
Electrocardiogram on [**3-8**] and [**3-10**] showed a QTC of 500 msec; however, the EP Service was called again.
The patient's creatinine was stable with a peak of 1.5 and 1.3 on the day of discharge, and it was felt that there was no need for adjustment of the Dofetilide dosing at this point, as it was maintaining the patient in sinus rhythm and patient's potassium was maintained at 4-4.5.
The patient's blood pressure continued to run in the low 100 range during diuresis, especially during the more aggressive phase.
Her pressure was better maintained in the 100-110 range on 50 mg t.i.d., and this should be continued as an outpatient.
As far as studies go, the patient had an echocardiogram on [**2121-3-3**], to assess for changes in heart function as the cause of the heart failure.
Her ejection fraction was still good at 60%.
The patient will need periodic checks of her pulmonary function and oxygenation as an outpatient every four months for about 12 months after the last steroid dose.
Overall the patient's respiratory status returned to her baseline oxygenation of 98% on 2 L, and the patient was stable throughout the hospitalization.
Her stools were guaiac negative, and the hematocrit was checked on a daily basis and fluctuated between 28 and 32; however, it remained stable.
Iron studies were pending at the time of discharge and will be followed as an outpatient.
Ddx of anemia was thought to include small bowel AVM and renal insufficiency.
Renal:  The patient's creatinine rose to a maximum of 1.8 on [**2121-3-5**], with aggressive diuresis; however, as studies continued, the patient's creatinine remained stable and was 1.3 on the day of discharge.
Endocrine:  The patient's blood sugars were well controlled while in the hospital on her standard NPH regimen, as well as sliding scale.
She should undergo a mental health evaluation beginning at rehabilitation and eventually be referred to the mental health team at [**Hospital3 **] at [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for long-term management of her depression.
