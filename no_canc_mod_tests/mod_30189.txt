The patient underwent carotid duplex study on [**2143-6-25**] which showed 80% stenosis of left internal carotid artery and 40% stenosis of right internal carotid artery.
Subsequently, patient was admitted for carotid angiogram and percutaneous intervention by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Patient has had numerous cardiac catheterizations including cardiac catheterization in [**2140-10-23**] status post distal RCA stent placement, cardiac catheterization [**7-/2140**] status post proximal OM-1 stent for 70% proximal stenosis, cardiac catheterization on [**10-23**] which showed an ejection fraction of 68%, right dominant system.
RCA was 30% mid stenosis and distal RCA and obtuse marginal stents patent.
Emphysema by pulmonary function tests on [**5-25**] showing mild obstructive pattern of gas trapping.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/78, pulse of 54, respirations 21, O2 saturation of 93% on room air.
Physical examination showed a nice gentleman in no apparent distress.
Patient's visual field examination was significant for left visual field cut on his left eye.
Patient's right visual field examination was normal.
Ophthalmoscopic examination nondilated eyes revealed no gross abnormalities.
Pulmonary was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY VALUES:  Patient had normal white count, hematocrit was stable at 43.9; the patient's platelets were 131.
Patient's renal panel was normal with BUN and creatinine of 13 and 1.0 respectively.
Patient's initial electrocardiogram was significant for sinus bradycardia with a ventricular of 40-50 beats per minute.
Carotid angiogram:  Left carotid angiogram showed 90% distal occlusion of the common carotid artery and 90% occlusion of internal carotid artery with ulceration, Percusurge wire was used and two stents were placed in ACA and MCA.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted for CCU for close monitoring initially target systolic blood pressure was 140s-160s.
Patient was started on Neo-Synephrine drip, with which a target blood pressure goal was achieved.
Over the course of the night, patient did have an episode of asymptomatic bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s to 40s.
Patient was given one dose of atropine with resulting heart rate posttreatment in the 60s and systolic blood pressure at goal.
Over the course of the next day, Neo-Synephrine was titrated off in order to maintain the goal systolic blood pressure of 140.
The patient was given several boluses of normal saline to 150 cc to maintain systolic blood pressure at goal.
At the day of discharge, the patient's systolic blood pressure was ranging from the 110-120s.
The patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and it was in agreement between the patient and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] that the day following the discharge, the patient was going to followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for blood pressure check.
The patient is to followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the day following discharge for blood pressure check.
