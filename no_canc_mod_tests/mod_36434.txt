Admission Date:  [**2173-7-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-8-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-4-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Egg  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1390**] Chief Complaint: Rectal bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2173-7-22**] Diagnostic laparoscopy and rigid sigmoidoscopy.
A CT with contrast was done that showed colonic and small bowel distention, no free air or fluid, and a likely rectal impaction.
His labs were notable for INR was 5.4, patient is not anticoagulated.
White count 18.4, hematocrit 42.5, platelets 199.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his initial vitals were 99.9 102 117/84 16 100% 2L N/c.
His labs were notable for PT: 16.1, PTT: 34.7, INR: 1.4,Fibrinogen: 72, D-Dimer: >[**Numeric Identifier 3652**], WBC of 9.9 (N:87 Band:9 L:3 M:1 E:0 Bas:0) and Hct of 36, plts of 205, Creatine of 1.4.
GI was consulted and an anoscopy was attempted, but they were unable to visualize secondary active bleeding.
A repeat CT (CTA) done at [**Hospital1 **] showed interval development of sigmoid and left sided colitis as well as the new development of ascities.
I performed a rectal exam which had significant amount of formed stool and bright red blood around it.
Pt had a large BM after the exam with semi-formed stool with bright red blood coating it.
The repeated labs were then notable for fibrinogen which increased from 72->99, with D-Dimer at [**Numeric Identifier 24587**].
His Hct had trended up from 36->41, and platelets decreased from 205->170s, PT 15/INR 1.3 (down from 5.4 at presentation).
The surgical team who had already evaluated the pt in the ED was called back, given that his abd pain was worsening and he still had blood BMs.

At the OSH ED he developed frank rectal bleeding, hypotension (80/34), tachycardia and a CT with contrast showed colonic and small bowel distention, and stool impaction.
He had an elevated lactate, leukocytosis and tachycardia though was normotensive with IVF and blood products.
Infectious colitis was also considered and all stool studies were negative.
Patient's abdominal exam continued to worsen, his lactate increased despite IVF and ABX so surgery was consulted and he had an exploratory laparotomy on [**7-22**] that showed diffuse bowel edema/mucosal inflammation but no necrosis, no resection was performed.
On [**7-23**] Unasyn/Flagyl was switched to Zosyn when OSH called to say he had a GNR in his blood culture from ED (pre-antibiotics).
His GI symptoms have been ascribed to mesenteric ischemia in a patient with known atherosclerotic disease.
Following his exploratory laparotomy he had a colonoscopy a few days later which was essentially normal except for hemorrhoids.
From an ID standpoint, the team was then called by [**Location (un) 100633**]/[**Location (un) 5503**] micro lab that the GNR had Acinetobacter Baumannii growing from aerobic blood culture drawn in the ED prior to antibiotic therapy ([**7-21**]) that was sensitive only to Collistin and Tigacycline (MIC 4), intermediate to Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Cefepime, and resistant to Bactrim, Ceftaz, Cipro, Imipenem, Gentamycin, Tobramycin, Aztreonam.
This was growing in [**12-20**] sets of blood cultures, he had no more cultures drawn there.
He had 2 more sets of blood cultures done all which were no growth along with stool cultures.
The [**Last Name (un) **] service was also consulted as his blood sugars were not controlled and were generally in the mid 200 range.
