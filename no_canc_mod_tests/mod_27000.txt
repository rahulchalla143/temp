The SSCP and SOB was worse with lying flat, exercise, or deep breath and was relieved by nothing.
VS were significant for 300/170, 132, 60 -> the pt was started on a nitro gtt with improvement in his VS.
However his BP then dropped to 88/58 (leading to addition of levophed gtt transient), with HR of 95.
A CTA was performed (neg by verbal report, pending fax of official report).
Labs at OSH were significant for proteinuria, elevated BNP of 1295 (0-100 wnl), slightly elevated CE (CK-MB 7.6 (0.6-6.3 wnl)) and WBC: 19.4 (Band 1, Neutrophil 47, Lymph 20, Mono 7, Eos 4, Atypical Lymph 21).
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the pt was found to have VS consisting of: T: 96, HR: 59, BP: 94/56, RR: 21, SaO2: 100% on ventilator with nitrogg.
CXR performed demonstrated appropriate placement of ETT and NG tube.
Here, the pt was found to have elevated WBC count of 18, equivocal CE and was started on hep gtt.

He had no events on telemetry and ruled out for a MI with flat cardiac enzymes x 3 with peak CK 230, peak MB 7, and troponin (0.06-> 0.09 -> 0.05).
He was started on Aspirin, metoprolol, captopril, nitro drip and HCTZ with reduction in his blood pressure to ~200/100.
An echocardiogram showed depressed LVEF 40% with regional severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall suggesting possible ischemic cause of heart failure.
He diuresed with HCTZ 1L and was subsequently transferred to the CCU for workup of possible secondary causes of hypertension and hypertensive management.
A random cortisol level was found to be normal.
Renin and aldosterone levels were sent, but were taken in the context of the patient being on an ACE-I, so are likely to be nondiagnostic.
Renal artery stenosis was thought to be unlikely given that he tolerated a high dose of captopril (100 mg TID) and had a Cr of 1.0.
In the cardiac cath lab, he was found to have pulmonary hypertension - systolic 55, diastolic 24, mean 33, and a high wedge pressure of 30, as well as clean coronary arteries and no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
At time of discharge, his pressures were 148/60.
- consider outpatient CT to evaluate for adrenal tumor or hyperplasia - the PCP should call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 65432**] to get the results of your plasma metanephrines, urinary metanephrines.
- PCP should consider outpatient [**Telephone/Fax (1) 28085**] for sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea given pulmonary hypertension and history of snoring.
His urine cultures were negative, a urine legionella was negative and his blood cultures showed no growth to date at the time of discharge.
A repeat CXR on [**2-28**] showed no evidence of pneumonia.
- consider outpatient work-up .
Acute exacerbation may have been due to CHF (BNP 1300 at OSH) and pneumonia - especially with the WBC count and CXR findings.
respiratory drive due to CNS disease, especially in the setting of SBP of 300s, or possible drug toxicities (though OSH urine tox screen neg except opiates).
Diuresed 3.8 L on this admission with no evidence of CHF on CXR [**2-28**].
ARF: The pt had a creatinine of 1.3 on admission, which was slightly elevated.
Iron levels low at 22 with normal TIBC 229, though ferritin normal at 215.

He can call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 65432**] (the phone number of the CCU) to ask about the results of your blood tests for alternative causes of high blood pressure, specifically plasma and urinary metanephrines.
You should also ask him about referring you for sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea.
