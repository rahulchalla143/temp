Her admission VS were notable for a Tm 100.4, BP 106/60, HR 111, and 87% sat on RA.
CXR [**12-28**] revealed diffuse bilat infiltrates c/w ARDS vs PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] prompting a bronchoscopy and empiric administration of bactrim/solumedrol immediately prior to transfer.
All cultures remain negative to date, and she remains HD stable with no pressor requirement and normal renal function.

Since the previous tracing of [**2180-2-14**] right axis deviation is now absent.
She initially presented to an outside hospital with two weeks of anorexia, productive cough, subjective fevers/chills, and pleuritic chest pain.
After broadening of her ABX, checking an HIV without consent (which was positive), she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Over her course, she has been on the following ABX: Levoquin, Vancomycin, Zosyn, Meropenem, Ambisome, and Bactrim/Solumedrol (for empiric PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]).
All cultures have been negative.
There were multiple unsuccessful attempts at weaning from steroids, which seemed to support her oxygenation despite negative PCP.
Multiple sputum and blood cultures were negative.
An esophageal balloon was placed which revealed elevated intrathoracic pressures and her PEEP was increased accordingly.
2) HIV - This test was checked at the OSH erroneously without patient consent.
Her CD4 was fluctuated around 200 (low 188, 209 at discharge) and her viral load was >100,000.
She had a culture/ID history directed microbial therapy summarized as follows: Positive culture history: OSH: positive HIV antibody test [**1-4**]: HIV-1 positive VL [**1-11**]: 3/4 bottles coag neg staph with line tip positive [**1-13**]: Lip sore: HSV-1 [**1-22**]: UrCx: VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **] [**1-24**]: catheter tip coag neg staph [**2-2**]: CMV viral load 1320 copies per ml, [**2-5**] 1080.
Optho eval [**2-22**] showed no [**Female First Name (un) **] in retina.
Treat for 14 days total per ID (last day [**3-3**])  *UTI with VRE/GNR - The patient had a positive urine culture with VRE on [**1-22**] and received a course of 14 days of linezolid.
After another urine culture was positive for VRE on [**2-12**], her foley was replaced and changed to 3 day course of daptomycin for better urinary penetration.
*CMV viral load - This was found to be low level positive at 1320 copies.
ID recommended gancyclovir for postitive CMV viral load which was given for 9 days total.
This was changed to Valcyte for secondary proph [**2-16**] as CMV VL negative from [**2-14**], stopped [**2-22**] as CD4 > 50.
She had an opthalmologic exam which was negative for CMV.
* diarrhea - multiple stool cultures, and A dif A and B toxin were checked and persistently negative.
* finger necrosis - she developed dry gangrene of her left distal digits ([**1-8**]).
She had virtually daily "episodes" of breathing at RR > 50, pulse > 120, diaphoresis which were originally thought to respond to boluses of versed, then to oxygen, then to magnesium, then to conversation.
The first time her amylase and lipase were slightly elevated (315 and 156 peak, respectively) but CT showed no pancreatitis.
The second time she had abdominal pain she was felt to have gas pain or pain from atovaquone and was started on simethicone after abdominal CT was negative.
7) EKG changes - The patient was noted to have new T wave inversions on EKG with possible slight ST elevation on [**2-9**] which was new since [**1-29**].
Troponins were negative.
An echo [**2-11**] was unchanged from admission, showing mild LV hypertrophy, mod pulm artery HTN, no effusion, improved TR.
Iron studies showed iron 14 (low), TIBC 228 low, TRF 175 (low), B12 + folate normal.
She was controlled with insulin drip, standing insulin, and sliding scale, which was tapered along with her steroids.
She passed her swallow evaluation and could tolerate food at discharge.
12) PPx - She was kept on a PPI, sc heparin, and bowel regiemen when she didn't have diarrhea.
