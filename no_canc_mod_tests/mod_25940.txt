He went to see his cardiologist and was prescribed Digoxin and Lasix, six days after taken the medication his edema resolved and his weight was back to his normal.
Cardiac catheteterization showed ramus disease and referred for surgery.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Overall left ventricular function is now moderately depressed (LVEF = 35-40%) with paradoxical septal motion from V-pacing.
