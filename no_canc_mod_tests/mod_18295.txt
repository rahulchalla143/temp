He was also noted to have a low grade temperature to 100 and white blood cell count of 23.7 with a left shift.
Initial lumbar spine MRI was read as degenerative joint disease and multiple disk herniations without nerve compressions.
No signs of infection, however, patient's blood cultures there grew out 4/4 bottles of Strep mitis initially treated with Unasyn and gentamicin, and then changed to penicillin and gentamicin on [**2158-12-10**].
Patient's course there was complicated by a colonic ileus which was decompresses a rectal tube and a colonoscopy on [**2158-12-11**].
Given the bacteremia, endocarditis workup was pursued with a transthoracic echocardiogram which was limited, but had no valvular abnormalities.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was not done.
On comparison of the MRI of the lumbar spine, two MRIs, it was read as increased density in the L1-L2 disk, which is potentially consistent with diskitis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.8, blood pressure 150/80, heart rate 74, respirations 20, and O2 saturation 96% on 2 liters.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Knee flexion and hip flexion/extension were [**3-22**] bilaterally, and limited by pain.
LABORATORIES:  White count 17.3, hematocrit 37.5, platelets 219, neutrophils 65, bands 17.
INR 1.2.
Chem-7:  Sodium 137, potassium 4.2, chloride 102, bicarb 32, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, glucose 137.
MRI of lumbar spine without contrast on [**2158-12-8**] compared to [**2158-9-12**]:  Diffuse hyperintensity of L1-L2 disks consistent with diskitis, no bony destruction, no evidence of soft tissue mass or abscess.
Chest x-ray within normal limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted on the night of [**2158-12-12**] and was noted to be in severe pain and his neurologic examination was limited by this.
On [**2158-12-13**], MRIs from the outside hospital were shown to the neuroradiologist here, who recommended a contrast MRI to better evaluate the soft tissue and Neurosurgery consult was also obtained.
The MRI showed a large epidural abscess at T10-L1, and patient was taking emergently to the operating room on night of [**2158-12-13**], and started on steroids as there was evidence of spinal cord compression.
While there, he had a transesophageal echocardiogram done, which was complicated by methemoglobinemia secondary to the Hurricaine spray local anesthetic.
Epidural abscess:  The patient was noted to have a large epidural abscess on contrast MRI on [**2158-12-13**] and was taken emergently to the OR that night.
The cultures from the epidural abscess grew out alpha Strep and the identification and sensitivities were pending at the time of discharge.
MRI of the lumbar spine was obtained on [**2158-12-19**] and the read was pending at the time of discharge.
The transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained while the patient was in the Medical ICU, which showed no evidence of any vegetations or significant valvular lesions, however, it was believed that the patient did at one time have endocarditis, and the antibiotic therapy was tailored with this assumption.
His white count was slowly decreasing from a peak of 24 to 18 at discharge.
His surveillance blood cultures after the operation were negative for growth.
Urinary retention:  On [**2158-12-18**], the patient's Foley was removed, however, patient was unable to void x12 hours, and the Foley was replaced with 750 cc of urine return.
Hyponatremia:  Patient's sodium drifted down during the hospital course, and was 129 at the time of discharge.
His sodium should be followed at the rehab facility.
Hypertension:  Patient's blood pressure remained under good control on his usual regimen.
His beta blocker was held for several doses due to bradycardia, and should be continued to be held if the heart rate is less than 55.
q.d., hold for heart rate less than 55.
Penicillin-G 3 mIU q.4h., should be discontinued on [**2159-1-22**] or as directed by Infectious Disease consult team.
