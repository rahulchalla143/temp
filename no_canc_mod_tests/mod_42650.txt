Also, at the initial time of workup at [**Hospital6 4299**] she had been on Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation.
She had worsening oxygen saturation and increasing rales at the bases.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed her temperature was 97.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate was 65 (paced), blood pressure was 132/72, respiratory rate was 18, and oxygen saturation was 95% on a 5-liter face mask.
Her chest had no crepitus and was stable.
was 37.5, blood urea nitrogen was 22, and creatinine was 0.8.
Urinalysis was negative.
Cardiac enzymes were within normal limits.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Radiologic examination included a computed tomography of the cervical spine which demonstrated fractures of the C1 ring and dens, severe disc degenerative changes in the lower cervical spine, and effusion of C4 and C5 vertebral bodies.
Radiologic films of the lumbar spine and thoracic spine were unremarkable for any fractures or dislocations.
Of note, with these computerized axial tomography scans, it was noted the patient had a lung radiograph consistent with pulmonary edema.
A head computed tomography done here demonstrated no intracranial hemorrhage.
After initial film studies were done, she was diuresed and her pulmonary status dramatically improved.
Atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin for an INR of 1.5 to 2.5 which will be held).
