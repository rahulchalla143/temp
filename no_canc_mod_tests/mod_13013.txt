Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 107 0 64 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 59978**]0 ------------------- Imaging:  CT head ([**2-16**]): IMPRESSION: Extensive hypodensity involving the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes consistent with large vascular territory infarct.
CT abd/pelvis ([**2-16**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT chest ([**2-17**]): CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: The study is limited by insufficient inspiratory effort and motion artifacts.
The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis.
Retained oral contrast is seen in the visualized loops of bowel from the CT abdomen study yesterday.
Assessment/Plan  # Tracheobronchomalacia causing wheezing: This finding was seen on CT scan.
There was no PNA on CXR but she did have bilateral pleural effusions and very mild pulmonary edema.
She was given a couple doses of IV lasix 10mg with -1.5L diuresis total with mild improvement (note from [**Hospital1 59979**], Echo [**9-30**] showed normal LVEF 55%, no DD).
She will be treated with 5days of prednisone 40mg and nebs q3 ATC.
Acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure: The patient was noted to have pulmonary edema, however recent echo from [**9-30**] showed no diastolic or systolic dysfunction.
The patient most likely episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR which caused fluid to be retained in her lungs.
The area on CT scan did not look infected.
Acute renal failure: The patient was found to have an elevated Cr to 1.4 on admission (per [**Hospital1 3278**] records her baseline Cr was 0.6).
Her admission Creat was 1.3 and  remained stable 1.2-1.3 for the 4days she was here despite diuresis.
Given it is stable, likely plauteau phase of ATN, but we dont have an etiology for this (no recent contrast at [**Hospital1 1501**] that we know of, no NSAIDs (except asa) or nephrotoxins, etc).
Her creatinine should be monitored as an outpatient.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day): Hold for loose stools.
You were admitted to the intensive care unit with increased respiratoray rate and wheezing.
You had an image of your chest (CT scan) which showed fluid in your lungs and a narrow trachea and bronchi.
Your creatinine, a test of kidney function, rose from your [**Hospital1 3278**] baseline of 0.6 to 1.2.
You have a history of atrial fibrillation and your heart rate increased while in the hospital.
