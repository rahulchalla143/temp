In the ED at [**Name (NI) 34**], pts vitals were: Tm 103.6, HR 110-150s RR 12-18 SaO2 98-99%NRB.
Labs were notable for a WBC of 25 with 68%polys and a bandemia of 20%.
LP was performed and CSF analysis showed 7,250 WBCs with 92% polys, glucose 10, TP 1440, and gm stain with many polys, few gm+ cocci.
Bcx revealed gm+ cocci in chains in [**3-9**] bottles.
Micro lab performed latex agglutination on CSF sample which was positive for group B strep.
CXR showed cardiomegaly but no infiltrate.
Abdominal CT was negative for an abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump.
Head CT showed questionable changes from prior that might suggest the possibility of a right MCA infarct.
Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in [**2143**] when pt was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump ('[**64**]) for spasticity 2.
Last admitted [**Date range (3) 35**] for urosepsis 3.
Recurrent aspiration PNA - [**3-/2162**], [**10/2166**] - admitted both times requiring MICU stay, during '[**65**] admission trach was placed because was unable to clear secretions on her own [**1-8**] to respiratory weakness 1/03 admitted for lingular PNA, unclear if [**1-8**] to aspiration 4.
Osteoporosis 7.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2172-4-6**]):       3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2172-4-9**]):       >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.
CT abd post-op: 1) Large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal wall.
If clinically indicated, an ultrasound can be obtained for further characterization.
EEG [**2172-3-28**]: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the  presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized slowing followed by periods of suppression.
A repeat EEG may be helpful to further evaluate the severity of the encephalopathy.
EEG [**2172-3-31**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in stage II sleep with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of intermittent and independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both sides.
MRI [**4-4**]: Increased signal along the occipital horns could be due to cellular debris from meningitis.
MRV [**4-4**]: The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of thrombosis.
MRA [**4-4**]: Somewhat limited MRA of the head due to motion.
Head CT [**4-7**]: Stable appearance of the ventricles and sulci.
The following day, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be hypotensive with an SBP of 70.
Abd CT demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm hematoma in the RUQ at the former pump site.
Her hct bumped appropriately and remained in the high 20s for the rest of her unit course.
Repeat LP was performed since the pt continued to be minimially responsive (withdrawing to pain, occ.
CSF analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis.
She was pancultured and all cultures were negative.
A TTE ruled out endocarditis in the setting of group B strep bacteremia.
Neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the RUQ hematoma but found a new fluid collection.
She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL was sent for culture.
The culture returned positive for MRSA and gram negative rods (not pseudomonas).
Once the GNR sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas, ceftaz was stopped.
On bronchoscopy it was noted that she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized.
She was taken to the OR two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where her granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed.
ENT evaluated the patient and recommended a CT of the trachea to evaluate her anatomy.
The CT showed tracheal bronchomalacia and narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway.
Anemia: Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease.
Her decreased responsiveness was thought to be [**1-8**] to meningitis, but although pt seemed to have resolving temp and WBC with Abx, her diminished reponsiveness persisted.
Repeat LP in the unit suggested a resolving meningitis.
Neurology was following the pt and recommended an MRI to rule out stroke (esp given her ?
of stroke at OSH) an MRV to rule out sinus thrombosis and an EEG to rule out subclinical seizures.
An EEG on HD #3 was consistent with severe encephalopathy and an EEG on HD #6 was consistent with meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures.
An MRI was finally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke.
Respiratory status After a supposed seizure at OSH pt was mechanically ventilated thru her trach site b/c no breath sounds were appreciated.
Unclear whether BP was rebounding from baclofen d/c.
BP became well-controlled with systolic BP in the 90s-110s on standing doses of Lisinopril 20mg po, Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
At that point, another swallowing study can be performed and another trial of po feeding.
Enoxaparin Sodium 40 mg/0.4mL Syringe Sig: Forty (40) mg Subcutaneous DAILY (Daily).
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 0.5-1 mg Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Vancomycin HCl in Dextrose 1 g/200 mL Piggyback Sig: one gram Intravenous  Q24H (every 24 hours) for 4 days: please check daily troughs and give dose if level<15.
