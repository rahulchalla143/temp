Patient was initially evaluated at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and transferred here for further evaluation and treatment.
Initial enzymes showed a total CPK of 4,120, CK MB 20 and troponin of 17.4.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post cath in [**2131**] showing ejection fraction of 56% with anterolateral apical akinesis.
A stress test done at that time showed dilated left ventricle with fixed defects and anterolateral septal wall with high grade EAE and equivocal changes.
Previous MI was 5 years prior to 92.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs 97.5, 122/91, 70, 18, O2 saturation 98% on room air.
HEENT:  Showed constricted pupils secondary to narcotics, EOM's intact.
Cardiovascular exam was a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer included a CBC with white count 6.7, hematocrit 39.1, platelet count 196,000.
Electrolytes, sodium 135, potassium 4.6, chloride 100, CO2 77, BUN 11, creatinine 0.1, glucose 114, PT and INR were normal, PTT were normal.
CK totals were 0, 90 and peak to 412, MB were 82 and 6, MBI index was 20, troponin was 17.4.
Urinalysis was negative.
EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a normal axis deviation with inverted T's in V4 and V5 which were new.
Serial CKs were obtained along with serial EKG's.
Serial total CK's peaked at 533.
MB fraction peaked at 9.2.
Initial troponin level was greater than 50 and after the next 72 hours its level was 1.5.
Within the next 24 hours the patient underwent cardiac catheterization.
The patient's right sided pressures, PA was 50/17, right atrial mean was 16, pulmonary wedge pressure was 16, left ventricular end diastolic pressure was 17.
Cardiac output was 6.0, index was 3.3, EF was 30% with akinetic anterolateral and apex walls and hypokinetic antero basal wall and normal posterior and basal wall.
The native vessels showed left main trunk disease of 30%, left anterior was proximal 30% and mid 90% left circumflex was mid 50%.
Ramus intermedius was 90% which was angioplastied and stented and the right coronary showed an osteal lesion of 30%.
The patient underwent a right femoral ultrasound which demonstrated triphasic flow in the right common femoral artery with plaque or flap proximal to the right SFA with stenosis and did have episodes of SVG and was begun on beta blockers.
The patient, although study was abnormal but with intact distal pulses, the patient did note 72 hours after catheterization, onset of right calf and ankle foot pain with ambulation.
The patient underwent a repeat peripheral arterial catheterization which demonstrated abdominal aorta with no significant disease, renal arteries bilaterally were normal, the right lower extremity iliac is without critical lesions, the previous noted dissection is not occlusive but the site is still delineated.
The patient required a unit of packed cells for hematocrit of 25, post transfusion hematocrit was 35.
Total CK was 74.
An NG was placed with 300 cc of blood aspirated.
Serial hematocrits were obtained and Plavix and Aspirin were held.
The patient underwent upper endoscopy which demonstrated a few non bleeding localized erosions in the esophagus at the GE junction consistent with NG trauma.
His hematocrit remained stable at 29.
CKs were flat and serial hematocrits remained stable.
