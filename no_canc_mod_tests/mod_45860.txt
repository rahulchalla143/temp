The patient had persistent elevated LD and alkaline phosphatase but normalization of liver function tests.
Given the patient's subjective improvement and resolution of abdominal pain and ability to tolerate full oral intake, these changes were thought to be consistent with her clinical course and resolving pancreatitis.
The abdominal computed tomography on [**2-5**] also revealed evidence of portal vein thrombosis which was new and not seen on prior computed tomography.
An abdominal ultrasound with Doppler studies was performed to assess the degree of portal vein thrombosis and flow.
However, it is new compared to prior studies in the past two to three weeks.
In addition, an abdominal ultrasound will be repeated to assess for the degree of portal vein thrombosis.
Given these findings, a chest x-ray was repeated which revealed a moderate sized right pleural effusion that was new compared to a prior pleural effusion.
The pleural fluid had a white blood cell count of 993, a red blood count of 565, 7% polys, 89% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, and 2% mesothelial cells.
The total protein was 2.7, a glucose of 124, a LDH of 267, an amylase of 23, and an albumin of 1.5, and pH was 7.41.
Gram stain revealed 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs.
Fluid culture revealed no growth; both anaerobic and other cultures.
The patient will have a chest x-ray done by her primary care physician prior to this appointment and bring the film to this appointment.
HYPERTENSIVE ISSUES:  The patient had gradual improvement in her blood pressures with blood pressures ranging from 120 to 130 systolic at the time of discharge on metoprolol 100 mg p.o.
The patient will have her blood pressure followed up by her primary care physician and subsequent adjustment in medications as needed.
for two additional days and then have her INR checked on [**2121-2-8**] by the visiting nurses with the results sent to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5992**] who will then adjust her Coumadin for a goal INR of 2 to 3.
(starting on [**2121-2-8**]; dose adjusted based on INR with a goal of 2 to 3).
