History of Present Illness: 81 y/o F with history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diagnosed by lung (on home O2 3 L with rest 6L with ambulation), severe pHTN, AFib who presented to OSH on [**6-18**] with worsening SOB x 1 week.
The patient underwent a CTA of the chest that revealed no PE, moderate b/l pleural effusion, ?
She was placed on 100% NRB mask and transferred to OSH ICU where an ABG showed pH 7.35, pCO2 of 41, pO2 of 49.
She was started on BiPAP, ABG showed pH 7.46, PC02 30 P02 56 on 70% FiO2.
EKG at OSH also showed ST depression in the lateral leads, and patient's Troponins bumped from .39 to 7.
She had an echo earlier today which showed LVH and an EF of 60%, with RVSP of 69.
Prior to transfer, patient was stable off BiPAP with pH 7.44, PCO2 22.5, and PO2 130.
On arrival to the floor, patient was stable, T 96.8 HR 92 BP 117/52 RR 16 O2 95% 3 L NC.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 96.8 HR 92 BP 117/52 RR 16 O2 95% 3 L NCGeneral: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP 8 cm, no LAD Lungs: Inspiratory velcro-like Crackles 2/3 up b/l CV: Regular rate and rhythm, III/VI holosystolic murmur loudest at RUSB Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: [**2137-6-21**] Echo: IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-1-4**], the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now identifeid.
Based on [**2132**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is asymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**12-15**] years.
Pt gradually improved on pressure support ventilation and was extubated on [**2137-6-23**] after a successful spontaneous breathing trial on [**4-17**] and a RISP score 33.
diltiazem and digitalis were discontinued and patient was then restarted on metoprolol, titrated to a heart rate <100 for rate control.
Echo showed moderate LV systolic dysfunction and worsening AS.
Cardiac enzymes trended down.
Hct stable at about 40 on transfer.
