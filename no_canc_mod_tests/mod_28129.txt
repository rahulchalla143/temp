Today's exam reveals multiple predominantly upper lung field nodular densities measuring up to approximately 4 mm in size, which likely were present on [**2-26**] and may represent multiple granulomas.
Retrocardiac density, which likely represents a combination of atelectasis and effusion; however, focal consolidation cannot be excluded.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2112-2-27**] at 19:59 Test: TEE (Complete) Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler Contrast: None Tape Number: 2007AW2-: Test Location: Anesthesia West OR cardiac Technical Quality: Adequate REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% to 45% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 3.4 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *6.4 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Pericardium - Effusion Size: 1.0 cm INTERPRETATION: Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal -hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal inferior - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex - hypo; apex - hypo; RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and the T2-weighted images were acquired on a 1.5 T magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging, obtained prior to, during, and after the intravenous administration of gadolinium-DTPA.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated on an independent workstation.
Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in the delineation of the above findings.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
pt was ythen transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
He was admitted to MICU, a subsequent CT scan showed aortic dissection and he was brought emergently for replacement of ascending aorta and resuspension of aortic valve on [**2-27**].
