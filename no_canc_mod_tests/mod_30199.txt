In the emergency department, the patient was noted to be in a junctional rhythm and then had worsening bradycardia to a heart rate of 25, which caused him to become asystolic.
The patient also received intravenous factor VIII and calcium in the emergency department.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was significant for hemophilia A since [**2111**] with endogenous factor VIII activity of less than 1% and HIV diagnosed in [**2161**], presumably from repeated transfusions.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination in the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient had a temperature of 93.0?????
?F, a heart rate of 70 and paced transvenously, a blood pressure of 95/45, a respiratory rate of 21 and an oxygen saturation of 98%.
The head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, revealed no icterus or pallor.
The cardiovascular examination was a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.
There were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  On admission, the patient had a white blood cell count of 12,700 with a normal differential, a hematocrit of 40.3, an MCV of 102 and a platelet count of 262,000.
There was a sodium of 141, potassium of 5.4, chloride of 106, bicarbonate of 22, BUN of 26, creatinine of 1.0 and glucose of 186.
Prothrombin time was 13.5, partial thromboplastin time was 45.3 and INR was 1.2.
Calcium was 9.3, magnesium was 1.9 and phosphate was 4.3.
CK was 37, troponin was less than 0.3.
RADIOLOGY:  The chest x-ray was unremarkable.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Electrocardiogram #1 showed a junctional escape rhythm at 40 beats per minute with normal axis and intervals and no acute ST or T wave changes.
Electrocardiogram #2, after the pacemaker was placed, showed a left bundle branch pattern with paced rhythm at approximately 40 beats per minute.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for further monitoring and consideration of further electrophysiologic intervention.
All of the patient's blood pressure medications were discontinued, as they were considered to likely be a precipitating factor to his new onset arrhythmia.
The only concerning feature was that the patient became quite hyperkalemic to a value of 7.2 with a repeat value of 6.9 and had decreased urine output.
The temporary wires were left in place throughout the day on [**2180-5-11**], although the pacing rate was decreased by the electrophysiology team.
Hepatitis B positive.
