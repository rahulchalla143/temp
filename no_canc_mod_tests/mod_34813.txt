CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: None -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: Admission to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2-13**] with chest pain/anemia, s/p transfusion and EGD/colonoscopy negative for bleed.
Cath showed 40% LAD, followed by aneurysmal segment, then complex 80% stenosis in mid- distal LAD.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 0 cm at 45 degrees.

COMPARISON: Chest radiographs from [**2157-2-10**].
The ascites appears to be increased in volume compared to the scan of [**2-8**].
There is a moderately large right pleural effusion and large volume ascites which have increased since the prior scan of [**2157-2-8**].
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION COMMENTS: 1.
The LAD was heavily calcified; ulcerated 50% mid LAd; mid-distal LAD tortous with 60% before an aneurysm and 80% after at the origin of a small D4 with diffusely diseaseed distal LAD beyond; modest upper pole of high diagonal with origin tubular 60%; larger lower pole of high 1st diagonal with proximal ulcerated 60%; larger S1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed Fick average PA of 69/38/49mmHg with PASP ranging from 47-86mmHg.
There appeared to be a fall in PVR with addition of O2 and subsequently.
The oxygen saturation drawn with the PWP in the "PCW" position was only 71%, indicating mixture of [**MD Number(3) 82751**] and catheter position NOT truly in PCW (despite multiple attempts to get PWP distally, with often large loops in the RV).
He underwent a L/R heart catheterization which demonstrated elevated filling pressures in the presence of stable coronary artery disease.
His heart failure, and elevated pulmonary pressures were felt to be secondary to acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
# HCM: The patient has a known familial HCM, and presented with an elevation in his weight (when compared to his dry weight), and a persistent right pleural effusion.
He did not have any positive ascites fluid cultures, and his blood cultures did not speciate any bacteria.
In addition, he had a RUQ US which demonstrated a congestive hepatopathy but no evidence of cardiac cirrohsis.
Of note, his AST and ALT were normal at the time of presentation.
Of note, diuresis to his dry weight did not result in improvement in his renal function.
# Coagulopathy: His INR was elevated prior to discharge, and his coumadin dose was held.
The INR result was sent to his PCP for follow up.
# H/O Anemia: His Hgb and HCT were stable during his hospitalization.
After the hematoma was removed he had a pressure bandage in place for several days.
He was scheduled to have his sutures removed at his PCP visit two days after his discharge.
His INR was monitored daily.

Last INR was 3.2 on [**2158-2-24**] after coumadin dose (5 mg) was held for 48 hours.
Please fax results to his PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 82752**],[**Known firstname 275**] MARK [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82753**] (phone number) 15.
The procedure demonstrated that you had coronary artery disease in addition to chronic heart failure.
