Her BUN and creatinine peaked to 88 and 1.8.
Sodium was noted to be as high as 155.
At discharge chest chest x-ray showed no evidence of acute congestive heart failure with improvement in bilateral pleural effusions.
She remained in a rate controlled atrial fibrillation and maintained stable hemodynamics.
Oxygen saturations at time of discharge were 94% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Warfarin was continued and dosed for a goal INR between 1.5 - 1.8.
During her hospitalization, she had a repeat swallow examination on [**2143-12-9**] which revealed moderate oral and mild pharyngeal dysphagia.
There was however significant improvement in her swallowing study since prior evaluation.
