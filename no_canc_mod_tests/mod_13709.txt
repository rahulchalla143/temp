[**2170-7-21**]: CXR: In comparison with the study of [**9-18**], there are continued low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and some evidence of vascular congestion.
Opacification at the left base most likely represents atelectasis and there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
MICRO: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2170-7-15**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2170-7-18**]):       SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
# Hypoxemia: In the PACU, she was noted to be hypoxic to the 80s and have systolic blood pressures in the 90s.
Additionally, she underwent CTA chest for evlauation of possible PE.
CXR at this time was suggestive of pneumonia/pneumonitis.
Her hypoxemia improved and she was weaned off of supplemental oxygen.
She had close monitoring of her QTc, with frequent EKG monitoring.
Based on an assumed weight of 65kg, her free water deficit was approximately 1.7L.
Her sodium normalized with these interventions.
# Hypotension: In the PACU she was noted to have SBP in the 90's.
She was sent to the ICU for this, and her blood pressure was monitored closely.
Following formal evaluation by Speech and Swallow, she was placed on a pureed diet with nectar thick liquids, crushed pills and 1:1 eating assistance.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Tracheomalacia discovered on CTA chest- may need follow-up with pulmonary to determine need for possible stenting - Continued titration of her delirium medications will likely be required - Ortho follow-up next week for cast removal.
Information was obtained from  nursing home records.

Additionally, you had a CT scan of your chest, which showed that you have collapse of your trachea when you breathe out (called tracheomalacia).
While on the floor, it was noticed that you had a finding on your chest x-ray which could be a pneumonia.
