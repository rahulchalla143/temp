ccath [**12-23**] COMMENTS: 1- Selective angiography of this right dominant system revelaed three vessel coronary artery disease.
The mid LAD stents were 80% stenosed (late stent thrombosis) and there was evidence of progression of atherosclerosis in the unstented segments proximal and distal to the stents.
2- Legt ventriculography was deferred.
3- Limited hemodynamic measurements demonstrated normal aortic proeesure and moderately elevated left-sided pressure with LVEDP 24 mmHg.
ccath [**12-24**]: COMMENTS: 1) Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures and a severely elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
The cardiac output was low.
The systemic arterial blood pressure was borderline low.
2) Initial coronary angiography revealed a distal 40% left main stenosis, a widely patent LAD stent with TIMI 2 fast flow, the Diagonal had normal flow but an 80% ostial stenosis, the CX had mild disease but the OM1 had a 70% stenosis, and the RCA had a 70% proximal stenosis.
Echo [**12-24**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior free  wall, akinesis of the anterior septum, dyskinesis of the inferior septum (with  aneurysm formation), and extensive apical akinesis (with focal dyskinesis).
A right ventricular mass cannot be excluded.
Cardiac cath showed mild disease in LMCA, moderate to severe disease in LCx, diffuse disease in RCA and LAD stent restenosis & thrombosis with diffuse disease with progression of disease proximal to the stent.
However, EKG showed worsening of ST segment elevation.
Cardiac enzymes trended up to CK 1860 CK-MB 234 & MB index 12.6.
An IABP was placed and patient was transferred back to CCU.
An Echo showed EF 20-30% with akensis of the anterior septum, dyskinesis of inf septum, and extensive apical akinesis.
You will need to have your INR level checked on Monday [**2171-12-30**] at your usual outpatient lab.
