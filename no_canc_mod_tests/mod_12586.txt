[**2108-3-26**] Cardiac Catheterization  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 3924**] is a 66 year old male with no sigificant PMH who presented with intermittent chest pain.
At the outside hospital, the initial ekg showed normal sinus rhythm.
Then during episode of chest pain, ekg notable for ST elevations in II, III, aVF.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
He was started on Nitro and Heparin drip, given Aspirin and Plavix, and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.

Coronary angiography of this co-dominant system revealed 2 vessel coronary disease and LMCA disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systemic arterial pressure with an SBP of 147 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55-60% without focal wall motion abnormality or mitral regurgitation.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
The examination is otherwise unchanged.

The following day, he underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe two vessel coronary artery disease including a 70% left main lesion - see result section for additional details.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and further preoperative evaluation was performed.
Preoperative echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction with only trivial mitral regurgitation - see result section for additional detail.
One unit of packed red blood cells was transfused for a hematocrit near 24%.
At discharge, BP 106/66 with HR of 84 and room air saturation of 95%.
