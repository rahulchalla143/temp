Electrocardiogram revealed anterior ST elevations.
Cardiac catheterization revealed 100% lesion in the proximal left anterior descending, with a 70% lesion in her D1 and also a 60% lesion in her mid right coronary artery.
Cardiac catheterization was complicated by episodes of ventricular fibrillation when pulmonary artery catheter was attempted to be advanced past right ventricle.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 96, blood pressure 120/80, pulse 110, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 100% on nonrebreather.
Abdominal examination is benign.
LABORATORY DATA:  Throughout the hospital course, white blood cell count was 9.0, hematocrit 33.0.
Chemistries are unremarkable with creatinine of 1.0.
Liver function tests are normal.
First CPK was 76 with MB of 5.82 and troponin of 1.0.
Arterial blood gases show pH 7.31, pCO2 34, pO2 208, with an oxygen saturation of 97%.
Electrocardiogram at outside hospital shows normal sinus rhythm at 82 beats per minute with 3.
Cardiac catheterization - right heart catheterization shows right atrial pressure mean 19, right ventricular pressure 42/22, unable to advance to pulmonary arteries secondary to episodes of ventricular fibrillation.
Left heart catheterization shows right coronary artery lesion 50% proximal and 50% mid right coronary artery lesion, 100% proximal left anterior descending lesion, 50% septal one lesion, 70% diagonal one and two lesions and obtuse marginal one 60% lesion.
Cardiovascular - Coronary artery disease - The patient was admitted from outside hospital for treatment of anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction and went to cardiac catheterization laboratory and underwent successful PCI of 100% lesion in the proximal left anterior descending.
Cardiac catheterization does show that she has disease in her right coronary artery.
Her CKs subsequently peaked at 6000 and post cardiac catheterization she was started on Integrilin per protocol.
Transthoracic echocardiogram during her hospital course showed an ejection fraction of 25 to 35% with a mildly dilated left atrium.
She was found to have 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Although complete right heart catheterization was unavailable secondary to episodes of ventricular fibrillation, right atrial pressures did suggest volume overload at the time of admission.
She subsequently underwent aggressive diuresis with intravenous Lasix and her oxygen requirements decreased dramatically.
There initially were some concerns that the patient's electrocardiogram showed new development of a right bundle branch block in addition to her old left anterior fascicular block.
Pulmonary - As mentioned above, limited right heart catheterization and chest x-rays do confirm the patient to be in congestive heart failure.
Her oxygen requirements decreased dramatically with intravenous Lasix diuresis.
Her creatinine remained stable.
Otherwise, her hematocrit remained stable.
Her electrolytes, electrocardiogram had not changed and her chest x-ray was without significant changes.
