On initial emergency room presentation, vitals were Temp: 97.9, HR:70, BP: 209/90, RR:18, and O2 saturation 100% on room air.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 68 bpm with left axis deviation and no acute ST changes.
She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for scoping but after a prolonged procedure she desaturated and became hypoxic with oxygen saturations in low 80s despite supplemental oxygen.
Therefore she was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] to the operating room in order to undergo a rigid bronchoscopy/endoscopy to effectively and safely relieve the patient's impaction.
Of note, per anesthesia reports, the patient's left lung was suctioned repeatedly and noted to have copious mucous.
Intraoperatively, lowest BP was 100/40 and highest was 200/100 and her O2 saturations ranged from 94-100%.
She was gradually weaned off of sedation and given several small 250cc/500cc IVF boluses and her blood pressures recovered.
She was successfully extubated on [**2154-12-8**] and continued to have oxygen saturations in the low to mid 90s range on 2-4L NC.
Of note, during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]/MICU course her labs included a Hematocrit drop from the mid-30s range to a Hct of 27-28 which was likely secondary to dilutional effects.
She refuses to take home BP medications but has allowed IV Hydralazine for SBPs > 180s during this hospital stay.
On arrival to the regular medical floor the patient was still afebrile and had O2 saturations of 96-97% on 2L NC.
Otherwise, BP was stable with 150s/60s measures and she denied any cough, chills, chest pains, palpitations, abdominal pain,nausea, emesis or diarrhea.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.9, HR: 67, BP: 157/66, RR: 20, O2 97% on 2L oxygen, Weight: 52 kg GENERAL: Alert and oriented to person, place and time but some memory deficits noted.
RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, slighly decreased lung sounds at left basilar region.
No wheezes, crackles or Rhonchi ABD: soft, non-distended, normo-active bowel sounds throughout EXT: Warm and well perfused, 2+ DP and PT pulses, no clubbing or cyanosis, no edema distally.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-12-6**] P-R interval has increased.
PRIOR EGD REPORTS: EGD [**11-14**] and [**1-14**]; A single diverticulum with large opening was seen in the middle third of the esophagus.

An attempted UGI endoscopy and food disimpaction proved to be prolonged, difficult and unsuccessful.
Rigid bronchoscopy was complicated by a suspected  aspiration event at left lung as copious amounts of secretions were suctioned.
On [**2154-12-7**] a CXR showed small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
Fortunately, a follow-up PA and Lateral CXR showed no infiltrates.
Oxygen saturations were monitored closely with low flow 2L 02 via nasal cannula provided initially, then patient gradually weaned to room air.
She improved steadily and by time of discharge she had ambulation saturation levels >94%.
Pressures were stable upon transfer to the general medical floor.
Patient's blood pressure was in the 150s/60s range upon transfer from the MICU to the medical floor and urine output remained well above 30cc/hour.
Cardiac enzymes were unremarkable and EKG benign.
A more formal follow-up Barium Swallow study showed esophageal diverticulum arising from the anterior mid-esophagus, consistent with traction diverticulum.
# Hypertension: The patient stated that her usual blood pressure ranges from 160s to 180s systolic.
She received 10 mg IV hydralazine during her recent endoscopy after  systolic pressures rose into the 200s.
She was counseled on the benefits of therapy on several occasions and ultimately agreed to start taking daily Diovan for better blood pressure control.
Given weight of 52 kg, her calculated free water deficit was 1.1 liters.
She was given maintenance 1/2 NS IVFs overnight from [**Date range (1) 12714**] and her sodium improved from 146 to 139 and slowly stabilized.
She had a few drops in Hct which were felt to be secondary to dilutional effects from IVFs.
Hct dropped from 33 to 27 range and then returned to 29 by time of discharge.
#Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: The patient was continued on gentle IVFs PRN, and electrolytes were monitored daily and repleted as needed.
CALCIUM 500+D 500 (1,250)-200 mg-unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
An endoscopy or image study of your throat and esophagus was performed and your symptoms were due the lodging of some food in your esophagus.
Swallowing studies show that you are at an increased risk for choking when eating if food particles accidentally go into your lungs instead of your stomach.
