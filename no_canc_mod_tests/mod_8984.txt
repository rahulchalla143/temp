[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3891**] Approved: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**2126-1-8**] 2:21 PM      Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 19688**] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization.
The LMCA, LAD and LCx had no angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease.
Based on the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation was performed.
An echocardiogram on [**1-1**] was notable for 2+ mitral regurgitation and depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 30%.
Preoperative evaluation was otherwise unremarkable and she was cleared for surgery.
Given her cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease, her SBP was maintained between 120-140 mmHg.
Her blood sugars remained well controlled.
At discharge, her chest x-ray showed resolution of pulmonary edema with decreased left basilar atelectasis.
Her BP ranged from the 104-114/50-60's with a heart rate in the 70-80's.
Her room air saturations were 95%.
