IMAGING [**2204-9-10**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There is bilateral diffuse reticulonodular opacity in the lower lung fields and ground-glass haziness.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2204-6-4**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is increased and global left ventricular systolic function is improved with slight decrease in cavity size.
[**2204-9-11**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): In comparison with the study of [**9-10**], there has been substantial decrease in the pulmonary [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion with the pulmonary vessels now only mildly engorged.
# Acute Systolic CHF: Patient presented with increased dyspnea and chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.
Physical exam demonstrated rales to mid lung fields.
She had a session of ultrafiltration the night of admission and then a truncated 2-hour session of dialysis the following day.
ECHO showed an EF of 30% and so she was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg qHS, with lisinopril 2.5mg to possibly be started as an outpatient (and to be titrated up as her blood pressure will tolerate it and also to be held on her dialysis days).
After her dialysis session, pt's symptoms improved, physical exam demonstrated clear lung fields, and chest xray showed interval improvement in pulmonary edema.
EKG was without changes, and discomfort resolved on arrival and with subsequent nitroglycerin.
Her cardiac enzymes were trended until they peaked.
Her tacrolimus levels were within target.
She will continue to have 4 hours of dialysis, three times a week, with the next session on Monday and an estimated dry weight of 67.5kg.
# RHYTHM:  Pt was in sinus rhythm, and had no active issues with her rhythm during the admission.
She was monitored on telemetry .
# HTN: Blood pressure was well controlled on presentation.
She was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg qHS, with lisinopril to possibly be started as an outpatient as long as her blood pressure can tolerate it.
Her lisinopril should be held on hemodialysis days due to low blood pressures.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Recommend initiating lisinopril 2.5mg daily as an outpatient as long as her blood pressures can tolerate it.
STOP taking calcitriol START nephrocaps as a vitamin for your kidneys START pantoprazole twice daily for your heartburn START carafate up to four times per day for your heartburn, do not take this within 1 hour of your other medications START taking Maalox (calcium and simethicone) as needed for your heartburn START Metoprolol at night to lower your heart rate and avoid chest pain.
