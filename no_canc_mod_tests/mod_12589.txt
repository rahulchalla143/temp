Patient had an LP which was significant for elevated opening pressure of 37 and elevated RBCs - WBC was 5 (lymph predominant).
She was empirically treated for bacterial and viral meningitis until cultures negative and patient improved.
Numerous other viral tests from CSF were sent and were negative at time of discharge.
However, repeat EEG's without seizures and ultimately thought that seizures were highly unlikely so keppra was down-titrated and discontinued.
Chest imaging showed prominent bilateral pneumonia.
Stool sent for Cdiff toxin which was positive.
She requires a once weekly RAPAMYCIN level, CBC, Chem7, calcium, phosphate, AST, ALT, UA, urine protein/creatinine ratio checked every Tuesday and results faxed to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 697**].
HCT responded to 2units HCT 20 ->27 and stabilized.
Cardiac markers trended down.
Furosemide 60 mg PO DAILY hold for sbp <100  30.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 39143**],   You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after you developed a serious infection in your lungs requiring intubation, blood pressure support, and close monitoring in the intensive care unit.
You became very confused while in the ICU but this was not thought to be due to an infection in your spinal cord as a spinal tap was performed which was negative.
