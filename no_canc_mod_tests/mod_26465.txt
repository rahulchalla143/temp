LV systolic function appears depressed.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses and a diffusely small LAD with minimal disease in the RCA.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated left sided pressures (LVEDP 17 mmHg) and mildly elevated systemic pressures with no gradient upon pullback of the catheter from the ventricle to the aorta.
Left ventriculography showed apical akinesis with a hyperdynamic base (EF 53%) and no mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo female with h/o DM, HTN, seizure disorder s/p status epillepticus in the setting of subtherapeutic dilatin level complicated by respiratory failure, hypotension and cardiomyopathy with + cardiac biomarkers, EF of 30% on ECHO with apical ballooning and normal cardiac catheterization  1.
Her blood pressures quickly stabilized, she was weaned off pressors, and empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone and flagyl) were started for possible aspiration pneumonia in the setting of seizure.
Blood cultures, U/A, urine culture, sputum culture were sent and all were neagtive.
Cardiac: Patient had no known history of coronary disease, although had a cath for unknown reason at [**Hospital 33316**] hospital which was apparently normal and her pulsus was normal.
Her EKG was indicative of depression of LV function but without large increase in cardiac enzymes it did not seem that a very large MI was likley.
Echo was performed and showed EF of 30% with apical ballooning.
Thyroid studies and iron studies rulled out the above mentioned causes and it was thought that ischemia [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] subo were the most likely possibilities.
Cardiac catheterization was performed and showed no significant disease which lead us to believe that [**Last Name (un) **] subo was the likely cause of her cardiomyopathy.
She will have a repeat echocardigram in [**2-24**] months and follow up with a cardiologist back in [**State 4565**].
She will have close follow up with her neurologist for dilatin levels as well as with her PCP upon [**Name9 (PRE) 63652**] to [**Hospital3 **].

You were restarted on tegretol 300mg once daily You need to have your Dilantin level checked along with your Blood Pressure on [**2130-8-17**] at Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] office You can continue your lescol, plavix and fosamax   Followup Instructions: You should follow up with a cardiologist when you return to [**State 4565**].
You will need a repeat echocardiogram in [**2-24**] months.
You should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] on [**2130-8-17**] to have your chem 7, dilantin and BP checked  You should see a Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63653**] (Neurologist) within a week of returning to [**State 4565**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 63654**] to make an appointment)
