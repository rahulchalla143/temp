During this episode of transient arm pain the patient reported that his blood pressure was lower than usual at 100/40.
No beta blocker or nitroglycerin was given secondary to HR in 40s and a low blood pressure with 100-110 systolic BP.
Interventional cardiology team evaluated the patient and felt that there was no urgency or immediate indication for cardiac catheterization.
This decision was made given that repeat EKG had no changes significant for STEMI.
Mr. [**Known lastname 96908**] had three negative sets of cardiac enzymes as well which further corroborated the decision to defer any invasive procedures.
NECK: Supple with JVP of [**8-14**] cm range.
Coarse breath sounds diffusely with mild wheezes noted with expirations, right > left ; at posterior fields.
Pertinent Results: CARDIAC ECHO [**2187-11-10**]: Suboptimal study with limited echo window.
EKG [**2187-11-9**]: Sinus bradycardia, mild Right axis deviation.

Brief Hospital Course: In Summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 96908**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male who presented to CCU after [**Hospital **] transfer from outside hospital for emergent evaluation for what was thought to be an inferior STEMI after initial EKG at OSH showed minimal .5mm-1mm elevations in leads II, III, and aVF.
No beta blocker or nitroglycerin was given because of the patient's low heart rate in the high 40s -50s range in conjunction with his ongoing low blood pressures in the 100-110 systolic range.
As aforementioned, the patient was evaluated by [**Hospital1 1388**] interventional cardiology team and it was felt that there was no urgency or immediate indication for cardiac catheterization given that the review of a repeat EKG had no changes significant for STEMI.
A lipid profile was explored and showed reasonable values with no overt hyperlipidemia as his total cholesterol was 160, HDL 41, LDL 95 and Triglycerides 121.
He also had improvement in his low blood pressures throughout his hospital stay but it was felt that he should discontinue his HCTZ at time of discharge in order to avoid any additional BP drops and he was also advised to defer his Metoprolol dose if his heart rate dropped below 50 or his home systolic blood pressure dropped below 100.
The patient was asked to discontinue his HCTZ and to start taking Lisinopril 2.5mg daily with Metoprolol 12.5mg twice daily for appropriate control of his blood pressure.
The patient's heart rhythm was monitored continuously on telemetry while in the CCU and he was initially in sinus bradycardia so his beta-blocker was held and eventually continued.
An ECHO (TTE) was done which was unfortunately a suboptimal study with limited echo window.
Given the patient's history of hypothyroidism, he was continued on his usual home dose of Levothyroxine and his TSH was checked and found to be within normal limits.
In regards to the patient's DM2 management, he had well controlled finger stick glucose levels and was managed on a sliding scale protocol with regular insulin and his home glyburide was held during his CCU stay.
The patient's electrolytes were also monitored daily and repleted as needed.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): Do not take if systolic blood pressure is less than 100 or HR less than 50.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
However, a follow-up EKG done at [**Hospital1 18**] showed no concerning changes on EKG and additional lab tests and cardiac enzyme checks which were all within normal limits to show that you did not suffer a heart attack and you did not need any additional procedures or cardiac catheterizations.
You were treated for atypical chest pain and your blood pressure and low heart rate was monitored during your stay.
