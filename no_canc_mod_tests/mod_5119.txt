In ED: A/A Nebs, ASA, Blood Cx x 2.
+ radial pulse bilat  Pertinent Results: CTA Chest [**2131-12-26**]: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Right upper extremity venous ultrasound and Doppler examination, [**2131-12-26**]: Examination of the right internal jugular, right subclavian, right axillary, paired brachial and basilic veins shows no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
Fistulogram [**2131-12-28**]:  Central subclavian occlusion.
MRI/MRA Chest [**2132-1-2**]: MRA of the thorax shows normal pulmonary arteries bilaterally without central filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolus.
Large number of venous collaterals shunting venous blood from the neck and bilateral upper extremities around the bilateral subclavian vein and brachiocephalic vein stenoses.
Early on after the injection, contrast is seen to flow more through these collaterals than through the bilateral subclavian veins, right brachiocephalic, and proximal left brachiocephalic vein.
There are multiple bilateral enlarged axillary lymph nodes, which are nonspecific and were seen on the recent CT scan.
Dedicated MRI is recommended to better characterize.
CTA Chest [**2132-1-6**]: 1.
A TTE was checked and showed and EF of 75% with moderate LV outflow obstruction, [**12-17**]+ MR, and mild PA hypertension, and high outflow CHF [**1-17**] her AV fistula was thought to contribute to SOB.
Pulmonary was consulted re: PA HTN contributing to SOB and recommended PFTs, which showed a restrictive defect, as well as a RA ABG, which showed a pH of 7.39, PO2 73, PCO2 46, HCO3 29.
PE was considered on admission, however CTA was negative for PE.
was transferred to the MICU on [**1-5**] for hypotension and hypoxia, especially given known UE thrombi, however repeat CTA was negative for PE.
All blood cultures were negative, so this episode was thought be be [**1-17**] decreased pre-load from decreased PO intake and fluid removal at HD, and not sepsis.
Arm Swelling: RUE dopplers were checked on admission and were negative for DVT.
However given clinical concern for thrombosis, this was followed up with an AV fistulogram which showed central subclavian occlusion.
