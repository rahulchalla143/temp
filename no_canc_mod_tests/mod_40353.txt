The lungs appear better ventilated than at the previous examination and the pre-existing signs suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema have decreased in severity in the interval.
The acceleration times and peak systolic velocity of the main renal artery is normal, measuring 32.9 cm/sec and previously measuring 37.6 cm/sec.

[**2184-10-20**] MRI L SPINE: IMPRESSION: 1.
In the ED he had a his chest xray had new LUL opacities and RLL opacities concerning for pneumonia.
His WBC was elevated with a left shift.
BUN and CR were 45/2.2 respectively.
He was seen by transplant for his epigastric pain who recommended a CT of the torso which showed new central left upper lobe and right lower lobe airspace consolidation with near complete resolution of the left lower lobe airspace consolidation and probable loculated right pleural effusion as well as improved but mildly persistent chronic phlegmon with few residual foci of intrinsic air noted extending from the inferior stomach antrum towards the anterior abdominal wall with decreased amount of intrinsic, but extraperitoneal air in this phlegmonous change.
He was continued on tacrolimus 2.5 with daily tacrolimus levels and started empirically on linezolid and cefepime for a history of VRE.
His INR was supratherapeutic so it was reversed with FFP and Vitamin K. Transplant surgery recommended EGD to rule out a perforation in the area of his previous perforated duodenal ulcer.
Sputum gram stain found GPR and GPC's.
On HD 2 he continued to make good urine, his sats were in the high 90's on 2L.
His heparin gtt was held in anticipation for bronchoscopy however he did not get bronched until HD3 which revealed significant mucopurulent secretions throughout the airway with mucous plugs and moderate supraglottic edema.
BAL cultures were sent which showed no growth.
His WBC count decreased to 9.6.
On HD 6 his creatinine increased to 2.3 from 2 and his diet was advanced to sips.
His tacrolimus dose was decreased to 2mg [**Hospital1 **] per renal recs for a tacro level of 11 up from 5.
On HD 8 ([**2184-9-6**]) his heparin gtt was held for a bronchoscopy and EGD which were performed in the operating room.
Therapeutic aspiration was performed and a washing found commensal respiratory flora.
On HD 9 his creatinine rose to 2.5.
His urine output continued to be adequate and renal did not wish to start dialysis.
ABG revealed a metabolic acidosis with hypoxia and he was transferred to the SICU where his blood gas and respiratory status improved on BiPAP.
An NGT was placed to provide him with medications and nutrition.
His tacrolimus level was decreased to 1.5 [**Hospital1 **].
Though his respiratory status was somewhat improved he continued to have altered mentation and an elevated Cr so on HD 11 he [**Hospital1 1834**] hemodialysis.
Chest xray showed slightly enlarging bilateral plural effusions so on HD 12 he [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] bronchoscopy which noted significant supraglottic edema.
The tracheal button was noted to be partially occluding the trachea depending on his head position so it was repositioned.
On HD 13 he was started on Cefepime for a WBC that had increased to 13.2 and the positive gram stain from the day prior.
On HD 14 his WBC count continued to rise to 14.7 so an ID consult was obtained.
He was seen by ENT for his supraglottic edema and laryngoscopy at the bedside showed mild epiglottic and arytenoid edema.
On HD 20 he was given a unit of PRBC for a Hct of 21.6 with improvement to 25.7.
His tunneled HD line was removed by IR as well and he was given 10 IV lasix for a CXR that looked wet.
30 of IV lasix was given and his repeat K was down to 5.3.
His K increased to 5.5 and he was given an additional 20 of IV lasix after which his K was reduced to 5.
He was stable on the floor on a trach mask and on HD 27 he was noted to have a Hct of 21.5 which was thought to be secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
He was given 2 units of PRBC's with a post transfusion Hct of 27.8.
His Hct remained stable over the next several days.
He passed a swallow evaluation however he continued to refuse to take much by way of PO intake.
On HD 30 his dobhoff was placed past the pylorus under flouroscopic guidance and his tube feeds were restarted.
His K was 5.6 so per renal recommendations he was given 1.5 amp of HCO3 in 500 of D5W along with 20 of IV lasix with subsequent improvement in his K to 5.2.
The same process was repeated again the following day because of a K of 5.6 with improvement to 5.2.
His blood sugars were also elevated to the 300 range as he took both tube feedings and and a diabetic diet.
A renin level was sent that was 1.51 (within the normal range) and aldosterone level was high at 31.
His ISS and long acting Glargine were adjusted and his sugars became better controlled for some time.
He will need to have his fingersticks monitored closely at the LTACH and his insulin adjusted as he weans himself off tube feeds and increases his oral intake.
# Leukocytosis/thrombocytosis:  When the patient was transferred to our service he had a reactive thrombocytosis, but his white count was normal.
Two days after transfer, he developed a white count and a U/A was sent off, stool cultures were sent and patient had a CXR.
He had a fluctuating white count for 7 days ([**Date range (1) 57872**]).
ID was consulted and the plan was to hold off on further imaging and abx until the patient declared himself.
Blood cultures were sent and negative and histoplasma and CMV were also sent and returned negative.
On [**2184-10-15**] his WBC normalized then increased on the 27th.
At that time patient had a CT chest, CT and/pelvis and MRI of the coccyx that did not reveal another source of infection.
In addition, rpt C. dif was sent and blood cultures drawn that were also negative.
The patient was broadened to vanc/ceftriaxone and flagyl temporarily, and then the ceftriaxone was changed to cefepime when his urine came back with pseudomonas.
# UTI: As above, he was initially started on ceftriaxone and once the cultures came back, he was changed to cefepime.
However, given his risk for recurrent UTIs, I spoke with the patient and nursing about straight catheterization Q8H or sooner if his bladder scan is greater than 500cc on a regular basis.
The pressure of the pneumoboots caused a hematoma to develop around the ulcer.
MRI was ordered and was negative for osteo.
# ESRD s/p renal transplant: Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] was admitted with a creatinine of 2.2.
Over the course of his stay his creatinine fluctuated down to 1.1 and then up to 1.6.
When his creatinine began to rise on [**2184-10-16**] his white blood cell count was also rising and work up revealed an UTI and he had also been overdiuresed.
He was given fluids and blood (as described below) for intravascular volume and his creatinine resolved.
His MMF and prednisone doses were stable, but his tacrolimus doses were repeatedly adjusted depending on his levels.
when his euvolemia was maintained, his renal function improved and on discharge he was making good urine and his creatinine was 1.2.
On bronchoscopy and repeated imaging he does have chronic mucous plugging in the RLL.
His Hemoglobin hovers in the 7-8 range, but he will need transfusions on an as needed basis.
He will need weekly CBC and transfuse for a hemoglobin less than 7.
PTH was 77, which did not significantly explain her hypercalcemia.
His vitamin D level was low at 17.
He was started on Vitamin D 50,000 units Q weekly and will need a repeat level in 8 weeks.
On 6mg, he had a rapid rise in his INR and so his INR was lowered to 5mg the day prior to discharge.
His INR will need to be monitored closely and coumadin doses adjusted so that he can have a stable INR with the goal between [**1-23**].
He will be discharged on 5mg and will need a repeat INR on [**2184-10-24**] and need to adjust his dose based on his level  # Anxiety/depressions: Given his prolonged hospital stays and clinical deterioration over the last 5 months, the patient is notable very depressed and anxious.
His catscans were negative for obstruction.
His wife also does not want a [**Name (NI) 9945**] and feels that once he starts working with PT, he will have a bigger appetite and will eat more by mouth and we will be able to wean him off his tube feeds and back on a regular diet.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: LABWORK: - Will need Daily tacro levels and need tacro goals of [**3-26**], fax tacro levels to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at Fax: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21335**] - Will need CBC 3x/ week and transfuse for Hct less than 21 - Daily BMP, Ca, Mg, P for now and trend potassium as tacro levels come down, potassium should come down as well - Trend White blood cell count (3x/week) as it has stablized, but if trending up would need to have further work up.
- Next INR check on [**2184-10-24**] and adjust coumadin as needed  VOLUME STATUS: - Monitor his fluid status closely.
If concerned for dehydration or BUN/Cr rising on labs, would give 1L NS - Make sure he is taking his Sodium Bicarbonate  ANTIBIOTICS: - Cefepime 1gm Q12H until [**2184-11-2**]  GENERAL CARE: - Straight Cath Q6H - Wound care daily - frequent turning Q2H - Will need aggressive PT and OT - Chest Physical therapy - Continued suctioning and trach care - Tube Feeds unless patient is able to be transitioned to PO or agrees to G-tube - need to follow up on his beta glucan - If FSG are persistently elevated would have endocrine come to see him  DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: - Would increase clonazepam to 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] if patient is requiring a lot of ativan - Consider psych consult if patient is not participating in care - Social worker and case managers to follow closely - Needs lots of encouragement.
