He was noted to be relatively hypotensive compared to prior blood pressures with stable systolic blood pressures in the 90s to low 100s by the time of discharge.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was treated with Coumadin in variable doses for a goal INR of 2 to 3 for his low ejection fraction.
At the time of discharge, his INR was 1.6.
At the time of this dictation, the following laboratory studies requested by the Endocrine Service were available:  dihydroxy vitamin D was normal, 25 hydroxy vitamin D was normal, urinary NT peptide elevated at 260 (upper limit of normal 85).
Calcium was normal.
Prostate-specific antigen was 5.8.
A 24-hour urine calcium was 5.3.
Urine creatinine was 1.06 (normal).
Glucose tolerance test was 31 (normal).
Alkaline phosphatase was 84.
Bone scan showed nonspecific heterogenous uptake in the spine.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed degenerative changes of the spine without metastatic disease or cord compression.
These degenerative changes were stable when compared to an outside magnetic resonance imaging in [**2138**].
At the time of discharge, the bone biopsy which had been considered as a means to assess the nature of the patient's bone disease had been deferred as it was likely that the bone disease is degenerative.
(hold for systolic blood pressure of less than 100).
(hold for systolic blood pressure of less than 120).
Monitor INR closely with q.d.
Please send results to facility medical doctor and adjust Coumadin dose accordingly to maintain INR between 2 and 3.
Please check weight every day.
Consider the following medication changes:  Discontinuing iron sulfate as it is not clear that the patient has iron deficiency anemia and consider discontinuation of diltiazem if blood pressure and pulse are well controlled.
