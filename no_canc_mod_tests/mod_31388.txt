Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary disease.
The LMCA, LCx, and RCA were without angiographically apparent disease.
Limited resting hemodyanmics revealed systemic arterial normotension.
Final angiography showed an excellent result in the treated lesion with no residual stenoses, residual thrombus or flow-limiting dissection.
IVUS of the proximal LAD (including the old stent and the whole segment), showed an MLD of 4.3 mm and well apposed stent without  residual thrombus or dissection.
Monitor renal function and switch to renal dose if GFR < 50.
Complete smoking cessation, weight loss (minimum of 10% of current weight), and best medical management for secondary prevention (target BP < 130/80, LDL <70, HDL>45, TG<150).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Cardiac catheterization showed instent thrombosis of the proximal LAD bare metal stent (previously placed around 2 years prior).
The patient was soon started on metoprolol tartrate for blood pressure and heart rate control.
The patient had a TTE which showed apical akinesis and a depressed ejection fraction.
