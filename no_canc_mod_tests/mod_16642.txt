The patient reports that his dyspnea on exertion was such that, a few months ago, he could only walk 25 feet before experiencing the symptom.
He was found to be anemic, with a hematocrit of 27, and required transfusions.
An echocardiogram was performed during that admission, which revealed aortic stenosis with a valve area of .6 cm.sq., peak gradient of 6 mm Hg, and a mean gradient of 40 mm Hg.
The study also showed inferior hypokinesis, consistent with a prior infarct, and an ejection fraction of 50%.
The patient underwent an endoscopy to evaluate his anemia, and this identified erosions in the stomach, duodenum, and esophagus, which were thought to account for his low blood count.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed on [**10-27**] here at [**Hospital1 346**], which revealed his aortic valve area to be .9 cm.sq., peak gradient 50 mm Hg, and a mean gradient of 30 mm Hg.
Osteoarthritis 5.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2163-11-7**] and underwent a cardiac catheterization on the same day.
Following the procedure, the patient developed complete heart block, requiring pacing and continued monitoring.
