In [**2131**] an echo prompted a referral to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 696**] of cardiology.
She had an MRI done 2 years ago for monitoring to follow what appeared to be both a mitral valve murmur and an aortic valve murmur.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs prior to admission were as follows: White count 8.0, hematocrit 39.4, PT 12.3, PTT 29.2, INR 1.0, platelet count 230,000.
Urinalysis was negative.
Sodium 138, K 3.9, chloride 103, bicarb 25, BUN 17, creatinine 0.7 with a blood sugar of 79, ALT 13, AST 17, alkaline phosphatase 65, total bilirubin 0.5, total protein 7.3, albumin 4.7, globulin 2.6.
Preop chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly without any evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Preop EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 58 with an otherwise unremarkable EKG.
Cardiac catheterization performed in [**2139-3-6**] showed normal coronaries, 4+ MR, moderate AI 3+, no aortic stenosis, ejection fraction 60% and an LVEDP of 12.
Echocardiogram performed on [**2139-2-3**] showed moderately dilated left atrium with an ejection fraction of 58%, eccentric MR 2+, AI moderate to severe, [**Hospital1 **]-leaflet prolapse of her mitral valve with 4+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] PA systolic pressures.
Cardiac MRI performed in [**2139-2-3**] showed increased LV size, LV ejection fraction of 62% with a forward EF of 33%, mild aortic insufficiency, tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonic regurgitation.
She had bilateral atrial enlargement, [**Hospital1 **]- leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
ALLERGIES:  She had multiple allergies as follows: Codeine, penicillin, Gentamycin, sulfa, Vancomycin and morphine which gave her chest tightness.
She had 2+ bilateral femoral, PT and radial pulses and 1+ bilateral DP pulses.
She remained A paced with a blood pressure of 90/48 and a cardiac index of 4.2.
Her lung sounds were coarse.
Postoperatively her white count was 15, hematocrit 25, platelet count 107,000 with a creatinine of 0.6.
She was in sinus rhythm in the 60's with a good blood pressure of 102/46, satting 94% on room air.
Her sternum was stable and she continued to make excellent progress.
On exam there was no click and her sternum was stable.
A chest x-ray was also checked.
She spiked a temperature of 100.1 on postoperative day 3.
Urinalysis and cultures were sent.
