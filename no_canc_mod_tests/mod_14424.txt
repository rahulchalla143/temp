She denies chest pain but it was recommended that she have a cardiac work-up prior to her CEA.
On [**2198-10-30**], pt underwent an excercise test with nuclear imaging which produced chest pain at a low work load.
The imaging showed evidence of inferolateral and posterolateral ischemia and infero-apical infarction.
A cardiac catheterization was scheduled for the middle of [**Month (only) 404**].
However, two days prior to this admission, pt was shopping and experienced a sharp substernal chest pain that radiated across her chest and into her left arm associated with diaphoresis, no SOB, no nausea.
At that time, she ruled out for MI with enzymes and EKG and cardiac catheterization was done.
On [**2198-11-20**], cardiac cath showed severe multivessel CAD with high grade stenosis of the proximal and mid-LAD, large D1 and D2 branches, ostial LCx and ostial RCA.

Lasix was increased to 40 mg IV bid and CXR was ordered.
CXR revealed a small left apical pneumothorax.
Two left-sided chest tubes are in unchanged position with stable cardiomegaly.
POD #3 - Repeat CXR revealed there has been slight decrease in the size of the patient's left apical pneumothorax.
Epcardial pacing wires and foley removed POD #4 - Another repeat CXR revealed no changes in the size of the left apical pneumothorax.
Post chest tube removal CXR showed there is a small left apical pneumothorax.
