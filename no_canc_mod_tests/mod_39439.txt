IMAGING [**11-3**] MRI HEAD TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, axial T1, axial FLAIR, axial T2, axial T2 star and diffusion-weighted MR imaging of the brain was obtained without the administration of contrast.
[**11-7**] CT HEAD INDICATION: Patient with altered mental status requiring intubation, new diagnosis of HIV and occipital stroke.
COMPARISONS: MR brain of [**2102-11-3**] and CT brain of [**2102-11-4**]  TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired contiguous images through the brain were obtained without intravenous contrast at 5-mm slice thickness.
IMPRESSION:  Focal hypodensity involving the right occipital lobe, corresponds to patient's known area of infarction, and appears slightly more conspicuous from [**2102-11-4**] CT exam.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without the indication for intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**], read in conjunction with conventional chest radiographs as recent as 2:20 p.m. on [**11-7**] and a preceding chest CT on [**10-24**].
FINDINGS:  Moderate right pneumothorax collects anteriorly, and could be larger than it was on the chest radiograph earlier today.
A subcentimeter right upper lobe lung nodule, detected on the earlier study is still present and should be followed, 2:18.

-- could consider bone marrow biopsy to eval for infiltrative BM process although given other explanations, likely should wait until acute illnesses resolving before considering.
Unclear how patient acquired the HIV infection as no history of IV drug use, blood transfusions, or multiple sexual partners.
-- HIV genotype still pending at discharge.
Goal INR [**1-5**].
Discharge INR 2 after receiving 3 mg warfarin x 3 days.
Please monitor INR closely and adjust warfarin as necessary.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== - Repeat CT chest 6 weeks from [**2102-10-12**] to f/u pulmonary nodules  - Age appropriate cancer screening for origin of hypercoagulability.
- Please schedule outpatient PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] with [**Name9 (PRE) **] resident clinic ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 14740**]) - Please check twice weekly labs of CBC w/diff and Chem-7 faxed to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**] attn: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - Patients needs Ophthalomology follow-up in ~2 weeks post discharge for evaluation of HIV retinopathy - Patient needs vascular surgery follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].

5. miconazole nitrate 2 % Cream [**Month/Day (3) **]: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for ITCH/FUNGAL RASH.

This type of infection is typically seen in people with decreased immune system function, and you were diagnosed with HIV after a workup for immune deficiency.
Your hospital course was complicated by a stroke caused by a blood clot in the right occipital lobe of your brain, likely related to the same process that caused your arterial thrombus and foot ischemia.
Blood tests and echocardiography were perfomed to help determine what caused these blood clots, but no clear cause was found.
You were found to have the CMV virus in your blood, and were treated with antiviral medications, which will need to be continued for a long course.
You had an eye exam to rule out CMV infection of the retina.
This regimen may need to be adjusted based on the results of viral genotyping, which is still pending.
You will need eventual followup with Vascular Surgery for surgical treatment of your ischemic foot, likely with an amputation.
