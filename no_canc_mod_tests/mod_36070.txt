CT Head [**10-2**] IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Renal U/S [**10-3**] IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral renal cysts.
CXR [**10-3**] Moderate cardiomegaly has progressed and maybe a slight increase in atelectasis or new dependent left pleural effusion, but there is not a substantial change in the radiographic appearance in that area.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 79M PMH BiV/ICD, CHF--EF 20%, CAD--s/p CABG, CRI (BL Cr 1.5 - 2), p/w ICD firing in the setting of acute renal failure.
Pt with a h/o CHF with an EF of 20%.
On admission, digoxin level supratherapeutic and patient found to be in ARF with a Cr of 5.2 likely due to dehydration/prerenal azotemia.
On HD#6, pt was taken for VT ablation which was unsuccessful, as in the [**Name (NI) 13042**] pt had 3 runs of NSVT that were shocked back into NSR by the patient's ICD.
- EP did not think pt needed DFT evaluation as his ICD fired successfully 3 times in the [**Name (NI) 13042**].
On discharge, pt was sent out on Amiodarone 400mg po qD x2 weeks --> amiodarone 200mg qday standing dose, mexiletine 150mg po qd, and Toprol XL 50mg qD.
- Urine lytes c/w prerenal state.
Creatinine increased s/p diuretic addition to 2.7 on discharge.
Pt will follow creatinine levels as outpatient with PCP.
* ANEMIA: - Pt's hct on admission 35, decreased to 30 on HD#2 thought likely to hydration from a hemoconcentrated state.
However on HD#4, pt's hct decreased to 26 and with his CAD h/o, was transfused 1u pRBC which increased his hct to 35 post transfusion.
Hct 28 on discharge.
- Pt had iron studies, vit b12, folate studies which showed MCV 97, Ferritin 67, on feso4 325 qd, nml vit b12, folate levels.
- Pt with hct of 28 on discharge, stable x3 days.
Pt was sent to rehab s/p EPS/VT ablation.
