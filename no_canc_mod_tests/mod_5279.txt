At that visit a CXR and flu swab were done and were negative.
He declined evaluation in the ED.
In the emergency department, initial vitals: T 98.1  BP 114/50 HR 81  RR 22 88% RA, 95% 4L.
CXR initially read by ED as PNA and was given levo and later ceftriaxone, however radiology read it as pulm.
BP dropped from 110 ->70s and he was given 2L of IVF.
Initial ABG 7.35/38/88.
BP began to trend down again and CVL was placed.
CE returned elevated at CK 704, MB 82 (MBI 11.6) and trop.

Renal ultrasound [**7-17**] 1.
TTE [**7-18**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-12-9**], regional left ventricular systolic function is now depressed (regional)  Brief Hospital Course: 1) Pneumonia Mr. [**Known lastname 19075**] presented with worsening shortness of breath, fevers, and cough and was found to have bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.
His sputum subsequently grew out gram negative rods, likely H. influenzae based on his positive blood culture results.
A viral respiratory panel was antigen negative, with cultures pending as of discharge.
His CK-MB peaked at 267 and trended down subsequently.
An echocardiogram was performed and was remarkable for a newly depressed EF of 35% and near akinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls, distal septum, anterior, and lateral walls.
Of note, he had been on levophed and dobutamine earlier in the day for blood pressure support -- and had recently experienced a myocardial infarction.
4) Hypotension He required both vasopressor and inotrope support for blood pressure in the intensive care unit.
We thought his hypotension was related both to sepsis and depressed cardiac function.
Urine output was initially poor but improved with dobutamine consistent with poor renal perfusion in setting of depressed cardiac function post-MI.
