In the Emergency Department, blood cultures were drawn.
(c)  A stress on [**2166-11-5**] showed no perfusion defects and an ejection fraction of 40%.
A renal ultrasound in [**2166-11-5**] was consistent with chronic interstitial disease.
Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 51% on echocardiogram in [**2166-11-5**] and 40% on Persantine MIBI in [**2166-11-5**]).
Magnetic resonance angiography of the kidneys in [**2166-12-6**] with mild stenosis of the proximal renal artery on the right.
Calcium carbonate.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed the patient's temperature was 97.3 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 58, his blood pressure was initially 230/83 (going down to 177 systolic), his respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was 94% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the mucous membranes were dry.
The lungs were clear to auscultation with right basilar crackles; otherwise, clear.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a systolic murmur.
Back examination revealed no tenderness.
Extremity examination revealed the left foot with dorsal edema (pitting), erythema on the left lateral around the medial malleolus, some left lateral leg erythema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 16.2, his hematocrit was 32.9, with a mean cell volume of 94, and his platelets were 273.
Differential with 94% neutrophils, 0% bands, 2.6% lymphocytes, 3.1% monocytes, 0.3% eosinophils, and 0.1% basophils.
The patient's sodium was 134, potassium was 4.9, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 24, blood urea nitrogen was 130, creatinine was 3.3, and blood glucose was 260.
A chest x-ray revealed mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure and cardiomegaly.
Repeat ankle films were done on [**12-29**], as the patient remained with an elevated white blood cell count.
On [**12-29**], the patient's white blood cell count was noted to rise slightly.
Therefore, they did not recommend an arthrocentesis but did recommend a magnetic resonance imaging of the leg.
On the following day, a magnetic resonance imaging of the left lower extremity was done.
The patient was maintained on these antibiotics dosing vancomycin by levels and given 1 g intravenous times one every day if level was less than 15.
The patient remained afebrile, but the white blood cell count did not really trend down.
The Podiatry Service was consulted who recommended a repeat magnetic resonance imaging to assess the left foot for the possible need of operating room debridement.
The day after the debridement, the patient's white blood cell count was noted to rise acutely to 18 but trended down after that after day.
On [**1-11**], the white blood cell count was 9.9.
On [**1-12**], the white blood cell count was 12.1.
Dressing changes were done twice per day (per Podiatry recommendations), and the patient remained nonweightbearing with foot elevation and multipoultice boot in place.
Blood cultures from [**12-27**] remained negative.
A urine culture from [**12-27**] remained negative.
Blood cultures from [**1-9**] were negative to date.
At this time, in discussion with the Vascular Service and Podiatry Service, we will repeat noninvasive studies of the left leg to assess left leg blood flow all the way distally, and the patient may need further operating room debridement depending on how the wound does.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  On [**12-27**], the patient had a chest x-ray showing moderate congestive heart failure with desaturations to 87% on room air.
The patient received Lasix 20 intravenously, and his oxygen saturations improved.
His standing Lasix had been discontinued secondary to increased creatinine, and Lasix was then dosed as needed secondary to his creatinine and clinical fluid status.
A repeat chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular engorgement with interstitial edema with small bilateral pleural effusions; essentially unchanged from [**12-27**].
On [**1-2**], he was noted to have an improving lung examination and a decreasing need.
However, a chest x-ray on [**1-2**] showed persistent vascular engorgement, bilateral perihilar haziness, as well as diffuse interstitial pattern; probably unchanged, but a right small pleural effusion did slightly increase.
Over the course of the next several days, the patient was noted to have worsening oxygen saturations and an increasing oxygen requirement as well as a worsening lung examination with increasing rales; however, the patient remained asymptomatic throughout this.
On [**1-6**], the patient had a repeat chest x-ray which showed worsening congestive heart failure.
After the procedure, the patient was noted to have significantly increasing oxygen requirements to maintain oxygen saturations above 90% as well as dyspnea.
For the subsequent days, the patient diuresed about negative one liter per day and his weight trended down.
At this time, the patient's oxygen need was decreasing and his lung examination was significantly improved.
A chest x-ray from [**1-12**] showed a slight improvement in congestive heart failure and continued bilateral right greater than left pleural effusions.
RENAL ISSUES:  On admission, the patient was noted to have a creatinine of 3.3 and a blood urea nitrogen of 130.
This was significantly higher than his known baselines which were a creatinine of 2 to 3 and a blood urea nitrogen of 50 to 80.
On [**12-28**], his creatinine was noted to rise to 3.8.
Fractional excretion of sodium was calculated at 0.8, but the patient had been on Lasix as an outpatient.
A urine culture was negative, and urine eosinophils were negative.
The patient's creatinine during this hospitalization was 4.4 and after that his creatinine was noted to trend down and stabilize between 2.5 and 3.1.
A renal ultrasound was repeated on [**12-30**] which showed no significant change compared to [**11-28**].
The right kidney was 13.3 cm and the left kidney was 11.4 cm.
Dialysis was considered to help with the heart failure; however, given that the patient was having good urine output to Natrecor and Lasix, it was decided to hold off on the initiation of dialysis.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  On admission, the patient's hematocrit was 32.9.
It appeared from previous records that his baseline hematocrit was in the low 30s.
Hemolysis laboratories were sent and were negative.
However, iron studies showed an iron of 14 with a total iron-binding capacity of 233.
Therefore, given the significant iron deficiency, Epogen was stopped and the patient was given five days of intravenous iron gluconate and changed to by mouth iron.
He also received transfusions to keep his hematocrit above 28.9.
The patient's hematocrit was noted to fall as low as 25 and 26 on several occasions.
The patient will likely need an outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy for surveillance if this has not been done.
On [**1-8**], the patient was noted to have an anion gap of 17.
Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.41, a PCO2 of 35, and a PAO2 of 59, and lactate was 1.7.
Even with the initiation of Natrecor, the patient's systolic blood pressures remained elevated.
The patient's systolic blood pressure remained high, so nifedipine-CR 30 mg once per day was added.
After a discussion with the Renal team, our systolic blood pressure was 140.
The patient's blood pressures were checked lying and sitting and were the same.
At the time of this dictation, the patient's blood pressures were under somewhat better control; although, they were somewhat labile.
Blood pressures will need to be followed closely as significantly elevated blood pressures most likely will make his congestive heart failure difficult to control.
He had a troponin of 0.05, but this was felt to be secondary to his congestive heart failure and renal failure and not an acute myocardial infarction.
The patient was monitored on telemetry and was only noted to have rare single premature ventricular contractions and occasional sinus bradycardia.
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of 50%, a P-R gradient of 49% to 54%, moderately dilated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular free wall motion was normal, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
It was felt unlikely to be [**Last Name (un) 21160**] given his non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in [**2166-11-5**], had negative creatine kinases, and only mild troponin levels, and his echocardiogram did not show any focal wall motion abnormalities.
Liver function tests were sent given the patient's nausea, and his transaminases were noted to be normal as was his total bilirubin.
However, his alkaline phosphatase and glutamyltransferase were noted to be elevated with an alkaline phosphatase of 327 and a glucose tolerance test of 241; however, this had been chronically elevated since [**2166-2-5**].
In [**2166-2-5**], an abdominal ultrasound showed cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis, and no evidence of biliary ductal distention to suggest obstruction.
The Vascular Service followed the patient throughout his hospitalization and felt that a magnetic resonance angiography should be done nonurgently to evaluate this further.
An ultrasound of the right upper extremity was performed which showed no clot of fluid collection.
