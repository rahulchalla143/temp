Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2-27**] with Grade I varices.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**3-3**] for hematemesis with Grade II-III varices requiring [**Last Name (un) 9081**] placement after failed injection.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**3-13**] for hematemesis with Grade II varices with bands times two were placed.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**3-19**] for hematemesis due to laceration near banding.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**4-16**] for hematemesis with Grade II varices, bands times three placed.
of hematemesis and a systolic blood pressure drop to the 70s.
During Medical Intensive Care Unit evaluation the patient with an additional 300 cc., bright red blood per os followed by approximately 500 cc., bright red blood per os with systolic blood pressure dropping down to the 60s.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed blood in the lower [**11-28**] of her esophagus and at the gastroesophageal junction, cardia and fundus.
Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a clot in the cardia and fundus with no active bleed.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission to Medical Intensive Care Unit was temperature of 97.0 F.; blood pressure 70/30 to 60/palpable; heart rate 60 to 80s; respiratory rate 12; saturation of 94% on two liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORY:  On transfer, white count 21, hematocrit 27.4, trending down from 32; platelets 97.
INR 1.9, PT 17, PTT 36.8.
Sodium 128, potassium 4.8, chloride 96, bicarbonate 21, BUN 65, creatinine 1.6 which is up from 0.9.
Glucose 136.
Calcium 7.5, magnesium 2.2, phosphorus 4.2.
ALT 47, AST 54, alkaline phosphatase 136, total bilirubin 16.5.
To help maintain her blood pressure with paracenteses, she required peri-procedural albumin.
Her creatinine returned to baseline with volume repletion.
However, during the course of her stay, her urine output decreased considerably.
Her creatinine did not increase however, it was felt that this was due to her low body protein state.
Her urine sodium was less than 10.0, which was consistent with possible early hepatorenal function and all of her medications were renal dosed and her urine output was monitored closely.
DISSEMINATED ZOSTER:  During her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay, she developed erythematous papules on her abdomen and upper thighs with what appeared to be scattered petechiae.
Although her DIC panel was positive, her platelet count remained stable and Dermatology was consulted to biopsy the rash.
Tissue biopsy and viral culture were consistent with zoster.
Since her zoster involved more than one dermatome, there was concern that her disseminated zoster may involve the central nervous system as well, however, it was felt that the risk of an lumbar puncture in this coagulopathic patient outweighed the diagnostic potential.
Her O2 saturation improved with Physical Therapy and out of bed to chair.
At the time of transfer, her saturations were 98 to 100% on two liter nasal cannula, with a markedly improved lung examination.
GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS:  On [**5-6**], the patient had blood cultures sent to evaluate persistent leukocytosis.
Her right internal jugular line was discontinued and pending isolation of culture, her PICC line will need to be removed and an echocardiogram should be checked.
On [**2122-5-6**], she had a positive urinalysis with 10 to 100,000 Gram positive bacteria to be isolated.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:   The patient is severely nutritionally depleted.
