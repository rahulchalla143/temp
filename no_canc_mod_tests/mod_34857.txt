Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA, LCx, and RCA were all without angiographically evident flow limiting stenosis.
Resting hemodynamics revaled aortic systolic pressure of 101 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow.
Coronary angiography revealed stent thrombosis of proximal LAD.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a SBP of 137mmHg and DBP of 92mmHg.
The catheterization on [**2175-3-4**] was complicated by development of a right femoral hematoma.
Femoral US on [**2175-3-4**] showed no bleed, pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula, and Hct remained stable.
Repeat PTCA with overlapping BMS was performed.
Patient will likely require cardiac rehabilitation, will defer further management to primary cardiologist.
Acute Systolic heart failure: After MI, TTE revealed LVEF = 30% and moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, anteroseptal, apical, and distal inferior severe hypokinesis/akinesis (LAD distribution).
Outpatient Lab Work Please check PT, PTT, INR and chem 7.
You underwent a heart catheterization that was able to open the obstruction.
Please keep all of your follow-up appointments and have your blood tests done as directed.
You will have your INR level checked at your primary doctor's office in the next few days.
At that time you should have your blood electrolytes, kidney function and INR checked.
You also have an appointment with a cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8725**] on Tuesday, [**3-28**] at 4 pm.
