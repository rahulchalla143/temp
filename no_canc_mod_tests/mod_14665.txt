Rhabdomyolysis/Proximal muscle weakness- Admission Creatine Kinase enzymes were found to be 11,419, this value peaked 3 days later at 12,300 and reached a nadir of 9,200 during the hospitalization.
His admission urinalysis was supportive of rhabdomyolysis with the finding of large Heme positivity with only scant RBC's.
However his kidney function remained relatively stable throughout the hospitalization with creatinine on admission at 1.1 peaking at 1.4 and reaching a nadir of 0.8.
Abdominal ultrasound did not reveal any ascites, could not adequately assess the patient's liver, but did note a mildly enlarged spleen to 13.6cm.
Hepatitis B and C were negative, neurology consultation was obtained at it was felt that the patient's long term use of tricor in combination with the recent addition of Ezetemibe were likely at cause for the patient's CK elevation.
Creatinine values exhibited some fluctation from 1.1-1.4-0.8 At time of discharge it was thought the patient's CK elevation could be due to lingering effects of Tricor/Zetia combination, however an intrabdominal process that may explain the patient's clinical picture could be be ruled out.
MR scan with gadolinium contrast was attempted, but the patient was unable to fit into the MR machine due to his abdominal girth.
An outpatient open MRI is suggested to further evaluate the abdomen and specifically the liver to assess for possible vascular or intrahepatic process.
CT abdomen with contrast was not obtained due to the patient's baseline mild renal insufficiency.
Diastolic CHF/CAD/AFib- Cardiology consultation was obtained on admission for evaluation of elevated CK-MB and Troponin.
CK-MB enzymes trended down moderately, but remained elevated in the setting of his general CK eleavtion.
Transthoracic Echocardiography revealed LVEF of 55%, and mildly dilated [**Doctor Last Name 1754**], no wall motion abnormalities.
Of note, the patient's chest xray was never fully consistent with a picture of heart failure, but rather demonstrated low lung volumes.
They suggested an outpatient sleep study with follow up by the sleep clinic at [**Hospital1 **] (or other facility of the PCP's choosing).
Further cause for the need for abdominal evaluation .
Transaminitis: The patient AST was around 500 and ALT mid-high 400's.
DM2: The patient's blood glucose levels were optimally maintained on NPH 18 U in AM, 12 U in the evening, in combination with a humalog sliding scale.
It is recommended you have further evaluation of your liver, with an MRI scan, as an outpatient.
3)The pulmonary doctors have recommended [**Name5 (PTitle) **] have schedule a sleep study due to their concern for obstructive sleep apnea and how it may be affecting your heart.
You can follow up with the sleep clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] with the results from your sleep study if you choose.
