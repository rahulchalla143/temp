HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 24735**] is an 83-year-old African American Male with a history of [**State 531**] Heart Association Class IV- heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2096**] with re-do in [**2108**].
Atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.2, status post AICD with biventricular pacer placed [**8-17**] who presented with hyperthermia and a temperature of 107 degrees.
EMS was called, they found the patient to have a temperature of 107 degrees, heart rate of 100 and regular.
Blood pressure 180/palp.
Respiratory rate 36 and an oxygen saturation of 100.
The patient was given ice packs to the groin and axilla and a cooling blanket as well as three liters of normal saline with a resulting temperature of 102 and a heart rate of 87 and a blood pressure of 118/59.
His blood pressure and heart rate remained stable.
The patient was placed on assist control ventilation with a volume of 500 and rate of 10.
Pressor support of 5 with PEEP of 5 and an FIO2 of .4.
His subsequent gas was 7.46, 44 and 119.
At this time the neurological exam revealed the patient to be unresponsive, not following commands, not withdrawing from pain but with spontaneous movements.
A Persantine MIBI on [**2115-4-29**] was noted to have moderate reversible defects in the inferior base, global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 21% with uninterpretable electrocardiogram changes secondary to a paced rhythm.
This is a stable study compared with his study performed on [**2113-5-6**].
Most recent transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2114-8-16**] showed an ejection fraction of 35%  3.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of around 2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:: Vital signs revealed a temperature of 102, blood pressure 118/59, heart rate 87, respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation of 100% and an FIO2 of 0.4.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat he had bilateral cataracts, left greater than right with no pupillary response on the left and a sluggish pupillary response to light on the right.
Chest: Lungs that were clear to auscultation anteriorly and bilaterally.
Cardiovascular exam was without tachycardia with a regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Neurological exam revealed an unresponsive patient.
PERTINENT LABORATORY:  On admission revealed a white blood count of 6.8, hemoglobin 16.0, hematocrit 31.1, platelets 164.
Prothrombin time of 13.5, INR 1.2, sodium was 144, potassium 5.1, chloride 0.101, bicarbonate 25, BUN 111, Creatinine 4.
Glucose 123.
Creatinine kinase was 340.
Troponin 6.4, calcium 9.6, magnesium 2.3, phosphorus 2.5, ALT 29, AST 43, APE 3, lipase 57, amylase 193, albumin 3.8, lactate 3.7.
Chest x-ray showed an enlarged heart, no pleural effusions, patchy opacities bilaterally with less basilar atelectasis.
Head CT revealed no acute intracranial pathology.
Electrocardiogram revealed ventricular paced rhythm at 83 beats per minute, no acute T-waves or ST segment changes.
IMPRESSION:  83-year-old male with Class IV congestive heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 20%, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, status post AICD with biventricular pacer admitted with severe hyperthermia.
The patient's temperature had returned to the normal range by the time he arrived in the MICU.
His temperature remained stable throughout his stay.
A CT of his head showed no acute bleed or stroke.
An EEG done showed diffuse swelling and no seizure activity.
Lumbar puncture revealed 2 white blood cells and 3 red blood cells.
Blood, urine and sputum cultures remained negative.
The patient had acute on chronic renal failure with a creatinine of 4.0 up from his baseline of 2.2.
A subsequent electrolyte panel and Arterial blood gases showed metabolic alkalosis so his fluids were changed to normal saline.
Renal ultrasound was done and showed no Foley in the bladder.
The following day the patient's exam was consistent with congestive heart failure so he was given Lasix 160 intravenous with no urine output.
Urology was called to replace the Foley and the patient voided 600 cc's bloody urine and then continued to void 100 cc's per hour.
The patient's hematocrit on admission was 27.
Considering his history of coronary artery disease he was transfused one unit packed red blood cells to maintain a hematocrit greater then 30.
On day four of admission the patient was noted to have an INR of 1.3 and a PTT of 42.8 with platelets of 97 so he was given one dose of Vitamin K and a DIC panel and LFTs were sent.
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with Troponin of 27, CK of 1881.
A lead electrocardiogram showed paced rhythm and could not be evaluated with ST changes.
The patient was 9 liters positive on [**2115-7-12**] with crackles on lung exam therefore, he was given 160 mg intravenous Lasix in addition to his usual home doses of diuretic.
In addition the patient was having more trouble oxygenating which was thought to be the result of his congestive heart failure and he was mildly hypertensive with a blood pressure of 160/80.
It was later noted that the increased blood pressure and decreased oxygen sat was likely secondary to pain from urinary retention.
RSBI on [**2115-7-12**] was 70 to 100 and he did well with a Supraventricular tachycardia over three hours.
That afternoon he began to have oxygen saturation of 80% and was given Lasix and Hydralazine and he improved.
On discharge to floor the patient required 4 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 94%  8.
