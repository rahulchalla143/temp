Complete blood count:  White count 8.2, hematocrit 34.5, platelets 176 k.  PT and PTT were normal.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed a sinus rhythm, normal axis with interventricular conduction defect, nondiagnostic Q waves in II, III, aVL, aVF, V5 and 6.
CHEST X-RAY:  Consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2195-8-14**] which demonstrated single vessel disease involving the right coronary artery with bridging collaterals.
Patient was admitted to the preoperative holding area, and underwent on [**2195-8-26**] abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with a 16 x 8 graft and a right renal artery bypass.
His postoperative hematocrit was 37.
Gasses were 7.33, 45, 130, 25, and -2.
His systolic blood pressure remained 90-110 with adequate urinary output.
His systolic blood pressure was 104, diastolic 47.
CVP 13, PA 36/18.
Examination was unremarkable.
His systolic blood pressure improved to 134/diastolic 53, CVP 15, PA 41/18.
BUN and creatinine remains stable.
Hematocrit was 30.5.
His examination remained essentially unchanged.
Hematocrit drifted to 26.5.
BUN was 26, creatinine 1.0, and IV fluids were D5 and half at 125 cc/hour.
Electrocardiogram was obtained, was a normal sinus rhythm at 70 with no acute changes.
He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells with a hematocrit of 26.5 with Lasix between.
His Heparin was discontinued, and HIT was sent.
Postoperative day four his post-transfusion hematocrit was 28.3.
With adequate diuresis, his hematocrit remained stable at 29.
His HIT antibody was negative.
Hematocrit was 31 and stable.
BUN 27, creatinine 1.0.
Examination was unremarkable.
Patient with a low grade temperature on postoperative day seven and a white count of 20.0.
Urine was obtained which was negative.
A chest x-ray was obtained which showed a right and left lower lobe pneumonia.
Sputum showed 3+ oropharyngeal with greater than 25 polys and less than 10 epithelials.
Postoperative day eight, he had positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci [**5-8**] and positive sputum for Staph-coag positive, gram-negative rods.
Pedal pulse examination remained unchanged, although there remained some mild edema.
His white count came down to 7.8.
BUN and creatinine remained stable at 21 and 0.9.
Patient's blood cultures were finalized as Staph coag positive sensitive to clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, oxacillin, resistant to penicillin.
Urine culture grew Enterococcus which was sensitive to ampicillin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and Vancomycin.
Enalapril 5 mg q day hold for systolic blood pressure less than 110.
