No short-interval change compared to the study 4 hours earlier.
x-ray finger [**2199-2-12**] IMPRESSION: Right third PIP joint dislocation without acute fracture.
x-ray finger [**2199-2-12**] (#2) IMPRESSION: Reduction of previously noted third PIP dislocation.
CXR [**2199-2-12**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
MRI +/- [**2199-2-12**] (prelim read) 1.
Consideration could be given to a followup MRI once the blood products continue to resolve given the possible subtle nodular enhancement as detailed above.
Small right mastoid air cell effusion which when correlated with the preceding CT scan is associated with an oblique longitudinal right temporal bone fracture.
CTA head [**2199-2-13**] 1.
CT head [**2199-2-13**] 1.
CT Head [**2199-2-16**] IMPRESSION: 1.
His systolic blood pressure was maintained between 100-140 without intervention.
A repeat CT head showed a stable intraparenchymal and small subdural hematoma.
MRI brain showed no evidence of underlying mass.
A CTA showed no sign of vascular malformation.
The patient will undergo repeat MRI brain with and without contrast in [**4-23**] weeks for further evaluation of his hemorrhage.
A repeat head CT on [**2-16**] showed no change in the intraparenchymal or subdural bleeds.
On HD 5 the patient felt well and a repeat head CT showed no evolving process.
You should get an MRI with and without contrast prior to your follow-up appointment.
