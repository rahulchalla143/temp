Blow-by oxygen and stimulation was provided and Apgars were assigned of 7 and 8.
HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE AT [**Hospital6 **]: Initial hospital course at [**Hospital **] Hospital was notable for: - Discordant twin size, with this twin growth restricted at less than 10th percentile and other twin appropriate size for gestational age; - Mild respiratory distress and oxygen requirement that resolved over first 12 hours of life, most consistent with TTN; - Initial hypoglycemia, treated with intravenous glucose with a maximum of D-15 concentration; - Polycythemia with variable hematocrit values, with initial hematocrit of 64% and reaching 73% by day of life 3, prompting partial exchange transfusion; - Mild thrombocytopenia with platelet counts 70-80s, diminishing to 50s following exchange transfusion; - Sepsis evaluation on two occasions, with initial treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin and subsequent reinitation of ampicillin and cefotaxime, with both blood cultures negative; - Mild hypocalcemia, which resolved; - Mild hyperbilirubinemia which treated with phototherapy (infant blood type B-, coombs -).
Head CT performed shortly after admission to [**Hospital1 **] revealed a large right intraventricular hemorrhage with parenchymal involvement.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to [**Hospital1 190**], physical examination revealed the following: General:  SGA white female, quiet, asleep but responsive with good tone.
Red reflex present bilaterally.
Pulses within normal limits in all extremities.
Neurologic examination on admission:  Sleepy, quiet, status post loading dose of Phenobarbital but very responsive to examination.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: Birth weight was 1860 grams.
Her discharge weight is 2395 grams.
Serum chemistries including calcium and magnesium were within normal limits.
As described below, the infant underwent evaluation for the abdominal mass palpated on admission, thought to be most consistent with duplication cyst.
Evaluation included an upper GI study which did not suggest obstruction.
Urine and stool output have been normal.
Ultrasound was performed on [**8-5**], demonstrating a cystic mass in the mid upper abdominal region to the right of the midline measuring 3 x 3 x 3.5 cm, separate from the liver and adjacent to the gallbladder.
Differential diagnoses included duplication cyst, mesenteric cyst, and less likely a choledochal cyst or macrocystic lymphatic mass.
The mass was followed clinically at first, but due to issues with vomiting with introduction of enteral feeds, further evaluation was performed with repeat ultrasound and upper GI study, performed on [**2126-8-14**] at [**Hospital3 1810**].
Repeat ultrasound suggested the mass was most consistent with duplication cyst, and upper GI study showed displacement of the duodenal loop but no evidence of obstruction of flow.
Hematology:  Blood type is B negative, Coombs negative.
Initial hematocrit on admission to [**Hospital1 190**] was 56, and remained stable in follow-up.
Last Hct on [**8-29**] was 33.4.
In light of IVH, coagulation studies were performed and were basically within normal limits.
Hematology was consulted and considered the coagulation studies to be overall reassuring.
On admission to the [**Hospital1 69**], she had a platelet count of 43 and was given a platelet transfusion.
Platelet count post-transfusion was 143, and then remained stable, with last count of 272 on [**8-9**].
An LP was performed which was noted to be bloody.
CSF PCR was sent and results were negative.
Blood cultures remained negative.
Head CT was performed on [**8-3**], demonstrating bilateral germinal matrix bleed with extension into the ventricular and peri-ventricular matter on the right side.
An additional clinical seizure was seen on [**8-3**], and EEG performed on [**8-4**] and 20 suggested ongoing subclinical seizure activity, prompting additional doses of phenobarbital with an eventual level of 36.
Multiple head ultrasounds showed expected evolution of the right-sided intraventricular hemorrhage, with gradual cystic changes noted in the periventricular areas bilaterally.
Head circumferences were followed daily, and remained stable, increasing appropriately from 31 cm to 33 cm.
Head MRI was performed on [**8-28**], and revealed bilateral right greater than left multicystic encephalomalacia, primarily in the periventricular areas but also extending slightly beyond.
Last two phenobarbital levels were 21, last on [**8-29**], and dose was increased to 12 mg per day.
Repeat EEG was also performed on [**8-23**], secondary to persistent limited PO feeding, and revealed a generally normal background without seizure activity.
Weight 2395 grams.
Car seat position screening: passed on [**2126-8-27**].
