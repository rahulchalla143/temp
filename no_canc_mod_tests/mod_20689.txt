At discharge, the patient's blood pressure tolerated a dose of 12.5 mg and he did not complain of any headache, lightheadedness, or cough.
It was not felt necessary to increase his beta-blocker, but it insofar as his heart rate allows, perhaps this should be considered in the future.
Urinalysis revealed a urinary tract infection and culture grew out 10-100K Pseudomonas resistant to levofloxacin.
Their evaluation was that the patient required short term rehabilitation due to hospital aquired deconditioning.
Discharge Instructions: 1) Please take all medications as directed.
