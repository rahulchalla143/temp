Cardiac output by Fick was 2.95.
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 17, right atrial pressure was 15, pulmonary artery pressure was 35/18, right ventricular pressure was 38/9.
She received cardiac catheterization in [**State 108**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.8?????
?, heart rate 76-116, blood pressure 101/49, respirations 17-21, oxygen saturation 95% on 3 L nasal cannula.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
LABORATORY DATA:  Initial labs showed a white blood cell count of 8.3, hematocrit 34.9, platelet count 188, 87% neutrophils, 6 bands; INR 1.5; CHEM7 unremarkable; peak CK was 1388; pattern elevation of AST to 144.
Electrocardiogram precatheterization was normal sinus rhythm at 88 beats per minute, LAD normal intervals, Q-waves in II, III, AVF, V1-V5, ST elevations in V2-V5, 2-3 mm.
Postcatheterization electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, LAD normal intervals, Q-waves in II, III, AVF, V1-V5, ST elevations in V2-V5, 0.5-1.0 mm.
After the intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, however, the cardiac index failed to improve at which point right heart catheterization was performed.
Equalization of pressures in the four heart [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] were seen.
An echocardiogram was done which showed a large pericardial effusion which was tapped, and 350 ml of frank blood was drained from the effusion at which point cardiac index improved.
Repeat echocardiogram showed no recurrence of hemopericardium.
The patient continued to be monitored on telemetry.
HIT antibody studies were checked and were negative; however, the patient was switched over from Heparin to Angiomax for anticoagulation.
Renal:  BUN and creatinine were stable at all times.
The patient is to have INR checked every 3-5 days and have her Coumadin adjusted accordingly until INR is in therapeutic range of 2.0-3.0.
