The plan was to admit the patient to the Intensive Care Unit for serial hematocrit and abdominal examinations.
The patient's hematocrit was found to be serially 39.9, and subsequently 37.3.
The patient was then taken to the operating room by the Orthopedic Service for open reduction internal fixation of the right femur fracture, which was repaired with a right IM nail.
Postoperative hematocrit was 38.0.
He was febrile postoperatively with a temperature max of 101.4.
A repeat abdominal CT scan was obtained because of a persistently elevated liver function tests.
AST on presentation was 318 and then trended down to 162 and was 182 on discharge.
This repeat CT scan of the abdomen was read as significant for improved size of the intraparenchymal hematoma.
This was previously measured at 7.9 x 6.8 cm and a repeat was 5.6 x 3.2 cm with no ductile dictation, no extravasation of blood, and no free fluid in the abdomen.
The patient's hematocrit was stable and the patient continued to improve.
