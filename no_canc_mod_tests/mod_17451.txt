She was transfused with PRBC to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
Her heart rhythm and rate improved to sinus rhythm in the 60-80 range.
She remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm but occasional periods of accelerated juntional rhythm were noted.
At time of discharge, pathology of the right atrial mass was still pending.
