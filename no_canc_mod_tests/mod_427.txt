At the outside hospital, the patient was found to be febrile to 104.6 degrees F, and she subsequently developed hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s.
This study demonstrated 50 white blood cells (84% neutrophils), 10 red blood cells, protein of 23, glucose of 86, and 0-5 yeast per high power field.
Given the lack of Intensive Care Unit beds at the outside hospital, the patient was therefore transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.
Given the concern for an abdominal process, the patient was given levofloxacin and metronidazole; she was also given Ambisome given the finding of yeast in her CSF at the outside hospital.
In the Emergency Department, she had an abdominal ultrasound that was negative for the presence of gallbladder or ductal dilatation.
Also at this time, the patient began to deny the report that she was HIV positive; this report has been obtained only by report and not by documented laboratory testing from the outside hospital.
Therapeutic abortion x1.
INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.6, heart rate 95, blood pressure 113/71, respiratory rate 20, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
Her oropharyngeal examination was remarkable for upper dentures with eroded mucosa and white plaques consistent with thrush underneath.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
She had bilateral upper extremity tract marks in her right forearm and in her bilateral antecubital fossa that were clean.
Her laboratories from the outside hospital included the following:  Urinalysis was essentially negative.
One out of two blood culture bottles were growing gram-positive cocci in clusters initially.
Her CSF demonstrated 0-4 neutrophils and 0-5 yeasts per high power field, 10 red blood cells, 50 white cells (80% neutrophils, 3% lymphocytes, 13% monocytes), 23 protein, and 86 glucose.
Her complete blood count showed a white count of 13.3, hematocrit 35.5, and platelets 110,000.
Differential for white count demonstrated 77 neutrophils, 14% bands, 2% lymphocytes, and 6% monocytes.
Her INR was 1.28 and her PTT was 49.
Serum chemistries demonstrated a sodium of 133, bicarbonate 21, BUN 34, creatinine 2.0.
Of note, her creatinine was 0.5 in [**2143-1-23**].
Her total bilirubin is 3, direct bilirubin 2.3, ALT 967, AST 396, GGT 125, alkaline phosphatase 156; her LFTs had been normal at baseline one month prior.
Her electrocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 112 beats per minute, normal axis, and normal intervals.
Her head CT scan from the outside hospital demonstrated motion artifact and normal volumes to the ventricles.
An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated increased echotexture to the bilateral kidneys, and no evidence of hydronephrosis.
At the [**Hospital1 69**], her laboratories demonstrated sodium 140, potassium 3.8, chloride 113, bicarbonate 16, BUN 26, creatinine 1.5, and glucose of 204.
Her calcium was 5.8, magnesium 1.2, and phosphate 3.
Her white count was 12.2, hematocrit 29.7, and platelets of 60,000.
Differential of her white count demonstrated 68% neutrophils, 19% bands, 9% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes.
Her fibrinogen was 477, FDP 10-40, and D dimer was pending.
Her ALT was 529, AST 150, alkaline phosphatase 97, amylase 46, lipase 23, and albumin 2.3.
Her urinalysis had greater than 50 red blood cells, [**7-2**] white blood cells, and leukocyte esterase and nitrate were negative.
Her PTT was 36.7 and her INR of 1.6.
Her abdominal ultrasound demonstrated minimal new intrahepatic ductal dilatation and small pneumobilia.
A HIV test was done on admission to the [**Hospital1 190**] and was pending.
Infectious Diseases:  While the patient was reported to be HIV positive upon her arrival to the Emergency Department at the [**Hospital1 69**], her HIV test subsequently returned negative.
No yeast or fungal organisms grew out the culture of her CSF, and a CSF Gram stain was repeated twice at the outside hospital and found to be negative both times.
By hospital day three, the gram-positive cocci in clusters that ultimately grew out from [**2-26**] blood culture bottles at the outside hospital had been speciated as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
Given the finding of this bacteremia and her alarming concert of symptoms on admission, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on hospital day two.
This study demonstrated a thickened posterior mitral leaflet with a question of prolapse and at least mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation consistent with possible endocarditis.
Biventricular systolic function was preserved.
Given these findings, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed on hospital day three.
This study demonstrated a moderate sized mitral valve vegetation consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.
Given this finding, it was felt that all of the patient's initial signs and symptoms were consistent with bacterial endocarditis.
Given the patient's LFTs abnormalities on admission, an abdominal CT scan was done on hospital day two.
This study demonstrated a focal area of low attenuation in the contrast enhanced right kidney, that was ultimately attributed to a septic embolus to the right kidney.
These fluid collections were all thought to be secondary to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome secondary to the patient's underlying bacterial endocarditis.
In order to rule out the possibility of an epidural abscess, a spinal MRI was done on hospital day four.
This study demonstrated no evidence of epidural abscess.
This study did not demonstrate any definite evidence of a focal lesion in the third ventricle or a focal mass within the brain.
Her white count also initially remained elevated, but this too gradually began to trend down while on appropriate antibiotics.
Given these normalizations, and given that the patient's hematocrit had been remaining stable (thus indicating that there was no significant myelosuppression as a result of oxacillin therapy), the patient was discharged with a plan for six weeks of continued oxacillin therapy.
In order to rule out the possibility of mycotic aneurysm in the brain, a MRI of the head was obtained on hospital day seven.
This study demonstrated no evidence of acute infarct from septic emboli, and a subtle increased signal in the right temporal region that could be within the sulcus.
By the time of discharge, the patient's swelling in both her left hand and her left ankle had improved dramatically, and were nearly at their baseline.
Hematology:  Soonafter admission, the patient manifested a significant anemia with a hematocrit in the low 20s.
There was no evidence of hemolysis either by laboratory evaluation or by direct evaluation of the peripheral smear.
Given that the patient's hematocrit was low, she was started on iron supplementation during this hospitalization.
The patient should have her hematocrit, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase all checked twice a week while at [**Hospital1 **].
The results of these blood tests should be faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2504**] at fax #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**] in the Department of Infectious Diseases at [**Hospital1 190**].
Note that the patient should receive the hepatitis A and hepatitis B virus vaccines as an outpatient.
