She had a blood gas of 7.47/44/54/33.
In the ED, her VS were notable for BP 110/70, HR 140s with ST depressions in V4-V6, RR 30s.
Her CXR was felt to be consistent with CHF so she was given an additional 40 mg IV lasix with 530 cc UO.
She was then noted to have a temp to 102.2 so blood cultures were sent.

Doppler evaluation of the hepatic vessels show normal hepatopetal flow within the portal vein.
[**2139-2-12**] CT CHEST: 1.
However, followup CT in three months is recommended to document stability and to exclude a neoplastic etiology.
1.4-cm mediastinal lymph node, which is nonspecific but may related to CHF.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
[**2139-2-17**] CAROTID U/S: Less than 40% stenosis of the proximal internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Brief Hospital Course: # MICU course: In the MICU, the patient was stablized with IVF, however her laboratory values showed a severe hemolytic reaction with an rise in her total bilirubin to 21, a drop in her hematocrit to 23, acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2, and LDH >800 and haptoglobin <20.
She received 1u pRBC and her Hct stabilized at 23.
She was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 for continued diuresis and CT surgery evaluation for valve replacement.
# CV: 1) CHF - Her recent ECHO and cardiac MRI reveal moderate to severe aortic stenosis, with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2, likely causing her CHF in the setting of volume overload.
CT surgery was consulted for evaluation of the patient's candidacy for aortic and mitral valve replacement.
Hepatology felt that the patient was currently a Child's class C which would put her at high operative risk.
Her BP remained in the high 70s and low 80s, which limited our ability to use spironolactone and metolazone as additional diuretic agents.
Her creatinine was monitored daily and remained at 1.9.
Her electrolytes were checked regularly given the aggressive diuresis and were repleted as needed.
Her last troponin was .13 on [**2139-2-11**].
Lipids were checked in [**2137**] and showed an LDL 67.
She was monitored on telemetry daily and her electrolytes were repleted regularly.
DAT was positive, haptoglobin was <20, LDH >800, and bilirubin of >21.
She was essentially monitored and given supportive care until her labs began to improve.
# Thrombocytopenia - Her platelets were 38 after the Winrho infusion, but then came up to 83 by the time of discharge.
Her CT chest from [**2-12**] was consistent with CHF, as was her clinical exam.
# Cirrhosis: Hepatology was consulted for risk stratification during CT surgery.
Anemia - Her hematocrit dropped to 23 post-Winrho infusion, and then trended down to 21.
She was given 1u pRBC to see if that would improve her dyspnea and renal perfusion and her Hct bumped to 25.7.
It seemed that the patient had ongoing hemolysis, given that her haptoglobin remained <20 and her DAT remained positive.
Excessive phlebotomy might also be contributing to her anemia as she was having labs checked [**Hospital1 **] to replete her electrolytes.
Her Na was 135 on discharge.
Her electrolytes were checked regularly and were repleted to keep K >4, Mg >2.
BP 90's/50's, HR 70's.
