CXR [**2175-8-3**]: 1.
EKG on admit: NSR, nl axis, STE aVR, STD I, aVL, II, V4-V6 EKG following am: NSR, Nl axis, slight STD V4-V5.
Cardiac Cath [**2175-8-7**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed two vessel coronary artery disease with diffuse atherosclerosis with a patent prior RCA stent.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic systolic arterial hypertension (SBP 189 mm Hg) and moderately elevated LV filling pressure(LVEDP 19 mm Hg).
Left ventriculography was not performed.
ECHO [**2175-8-7**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >65%) The estimated cardiac index is normal(>=2.5L/min/m2).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-6-10**], biventricular systolic function remains preserved.
Stress (P MIBI) in [**6-7**] and Echo in [**6-7**] were normal (with the exception of focal calcifications of the aortic arch).
Given the patient's high risk (known CAD, multiple risk factors, age, + enzymes, EKG changes) and TIMI score of 5, it was felt she would benefit from early angiography for NSTEMI.
Her lipid panel came back normal.
She received a cardiac catheterization on [**2175-8-7**] which did show diffuse disease (see report) but nothing that was deemed intervenable.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and the patient was advised to restart her pump after the catheterization procedure.
Her pump was restarted on [**2175-8-8**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **], her sensitivity for correction was switched from 1:45 to 1:30.
#skin lesion - The patient was maintained on an antibiotic regimen (keflex) recommend by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21210**] for possible cellulitis.
Desonide 0.05 % Cream Sig: -  Topical -: Use on affected area up to twice a day.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.
