CT C-epine without contrast [**2188-3-7**]: 1.
Orogastric tube is coiled within the oro- and hypopharynx and does not reach the stomach (based on the CT of the torso).
However, comparison with prior studies is recommended to exclude a more aggressive etiology, such as a neoplasm.
If prior studies are not available, then an MR of the cervical spine may be helpful.
CT torso [**2188-3-7**]: 1.
TTE [**2188-3-8**]: The left atrium is elongated.
RUQ U/S [**2188-3-8**]: 1.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] w/o contrast [**2188-3-13**]: Diffuse marrow signal abnormality involving the cervical spine, which may be seen with reactive marrow changes in patients with anemia, diffuse neoplastic marrow infiltration such as with lymphoma is also a consideration.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CTA chest [**2188-3-16**]: 1.
Right lower extremity ultrasound [**2188-3-19**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right leg.
[**1-5**] blood culture bottles from [**Hospital3 **] grew Staph epidermidis, so the patient was started on vancomycin.
#Acute Liver Injury: The patient presented with ALT 999, AST 2486, AlkPhos 48, Tbili 6.0, INR 2.9.
Once the patient woke up, she denied any unusual ingestions, and her son was not aware of any toxic ingestions, though notes she has had fatigue and poor appetite for ~5 days.
Hepatitis serologies showed evidence of prior hep B vaccination and hep A exposure or vaccination.
Hepatitis C viral load was 13 million, genotype 1a.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed patent hepatic vasculature.
The patient's liver function tests gradually improved, and at the time of discharge, were notable only for mildly elevated transaminases ALT 102, AST 43, with normal Alk phos, Tbili, and INR.
#Acute kidney injury: The patient presented with creatinine 2.9.
There was a second mild increase in creatinine on [**4-29**] that was thought to be related to mild contrast nephropathy.
At the time of discharge, the patient's creatinine was 1.1. .
#Rhabdomyolysis: CK was 4000 on admission, and was likely higher than this prior to admission.
Her lasts PFTs reported showed severe obstructive pulmonary disease, with severely reduced diffusion capacity.
#Pulmonary hypertension/RV dysfunction: Echocardiogram showed dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction, along with evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
CTA chest showed no pulmonary embolism.
She will follow up with her primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 19039**] for further evaluation.
#Staph epidermidis bacteremia: [**1-5**] blood cultures from [**Hospital1 9191**] grew Staph epidermidis.

#Supraclavicular/hilar lymphadenopathy/ground glass opacity: CT of the chest on [**2188-3-7**] showed left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy measuring up to 18 x 17 mm.
CTA of the chest on [**2188-3-16**] showed prominent hilar lymph nodes, along with diffuse ground-glass opacity throughout the lungs which per radiology may be related to fluid overload.
This was further characterized by MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] [**2188-3-13**], showing the C6 lesion to likely be an atypical hemangioma.
A viral culture was sent and confirmed HSV-2.
The culture was negative.
#Anxiety/Depression: Clonazepam was initially held due to somnolence.
