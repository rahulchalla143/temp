ICD-9 Codes: 424.90, 427.31, 424.0 Test Information Date/Time: [**2153-2-5**] at 11:45    Interpret MD: [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD Test Type: TEE (Complete) Son[**Name (NI) 930**]: Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler Test Location: West Echo Lab Contrast: None Tech Quality: Adequate Tape #: 2012W012-0:00 Machine: Vivid i-3 Echocardiographic Measurements Results  Measurements  Normal Range  Findings LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
COMPARISON: Prior MRI of the head dated [**2153-1-30**].
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial MDCT images were obtained through the brain without contrast material.
Subsequently, rapid axial imaging was performed from the aortic arch through the brain during the infusion of Omnipaque intravenous contrast material.
FINDINGS: HEAD CT: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shifting of the normally midline structures.
Vague areas of low attenuation are noted in the centrum semiovale, likely representing edema or areas of small vessel disease, previously demonstrated by MRI of the brain on [**2153-1-30**].
The bony structures demonstrate multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine with anterior and posterior spondylosis, more severe at C3/C4, C4/C5 and C5/C6 levels.
Vague areas of low attenuation are identified in the subcortical white matter, likely representing areas of small vessel disease and subacute ischemic changes, previously noted on MRI of the head dated [**2153-1-30**].
He was noted not to be moving the lower extremities, and had asymmetry in the exam of the arms, along with mental status changes after transient episode of hypotension/ atrial arrhythmia and shocks necessitated.
MRI brain and spine performed.
MRI of brain showed no significant ischemic changes to explain such a poor mentation.
Neurology was consulted and felt imaging findings are consistent with  multiple brain infarcts (left > right) and cord infarction; likely attributed to perioperative hypotension and aortic manipulations.
Cultures revealed E Coli UTI, serratia PNA and S. marascens bacteremia.
POD 15 from initial TA AAA repair now with ischemic eschar around the inferior portion of the wound.
