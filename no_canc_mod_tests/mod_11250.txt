She has reported several episodes of atypical chest pain over the past years and apparently had a thallium and echocardiogram in the past at the [**Hospital6 1708**] with the results unavailable at this time.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 20445**] with chest pain.
Based on this, she was given a stress test, and on the stress test did 3 minutes and 53 seconds on a standard [**Doctor First Name **] protocol with no chest pain and nonspecific ST-T wave flattening in II, III.
She was scheduled for an outpatient catheterization here at [**Hospital1 69**].
Coronary artery disease, no specific interventions done in the past; however, transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2113-9-22**] showed an ejection fraction of 65% to 70% with trace mitral regurgitation, normal atrial valve, tricuspid valve, and pulmonary valve.
Exercise treadmill test showed nonspecific ST changes with 1-mm ST depressions in II, III, and aVF with shortness of breath and lower extremity claudication.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Ms. [**Known lastname 40027**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**11-26**] for an outpatient catheterization to the CMI Service.
In the cardiac catheterization laboratory they found a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% with no disease noted in the left main coronary artery, minimal luminal irregularities found in the left anterior descending artery, left circumflex with a moderate first obtuse marginal and second obtuse marginal with 50% lesions, and right coronary artery with 100% occlusion, with left-to-right collaterals filling the right posterior descending artery and right posterior left ventricle.
However, after the cardiac catheterization the patient was noted to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure down to the 70s, that was responsive that 3 liters of intravenous fluids.
Her hematocrit dropped from 38 to 29 and noted a large expanding abdominal wall hematoma.
The patient was followed with serial abdominal examinations and serial hematocrits, and when her hematocrit reached 26 she received 2 units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate response in her hematocrit to 31.
She continued to be followed with her hematocrit checked every four to six hours, and her hematocrit was stable from then on out.
On the next hospital day her hematoma appeared to be resolving slowly, and her hematocrit was stable, and she was transferred to the floor to the C-MED Service.
On the floor she continued to be followed every six hour hematocrit checks which remained stable at approximately 30, and based on this she was restarted on her cardiac medications including aspirin, Lipitor, Zestril, and Toprol-XL.
Right groin abdominal hematoma, status post cardiac catheterization.
