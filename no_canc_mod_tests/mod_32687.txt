She was scheduled for a MRI today by her Primary Care physician to further diagnose her dizziness and was found to have a large vertebral artery aneurysm.
She presented today to the ED for further workup and management.
She works as bookkeeper for her husband [**Name (NI) **]   Family History: Her mother and father both had cancer (unclear which type)   Physical Exam: Vitals: T99.9 BP 103/92 HR 94 RR 33 100% 40% FIO2 Gen: intubated, awake and alert, following commands, no acute distress Neck: supple, no JVD CV: RRR, nl s1/s2, no appreciable murmur Resp: vented breath sounds, decreased BS at bases, no wheezing Abd: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no rebound or guarding Ext: warm, no edema   Pertinent Results: CTA Head and Neck: 1.
MRI and angiography may be helpful for further evaluation.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS: IMPRESSION:  1.
Left upper pole homogeneously enhancing kidney lesion may represent a complicated cyst; however, further characterization of this cyst with MRI is recommended to exclude cystic renal cell carcinoma.
[**2189-3-31**] MRI Abdomen: 1) Limited study due to limited breath-holding capacity and lack of intravenous gadolinium.
5) Bibasilar consolidation and effusions, new compared to the CT of [**2189-3-17**], likely secondary to aspiration.

CT Head and Neck demonstrated a 3.2 cm extra-axial mass centered in the cerebello-pontine cistern on the left, consistent with a giant aneurysm.
HCT dropped to 21.6 on [**3-17**], med consult obtained and she was transfused 2U PRBC.
CT torso demonstrated several indeterminate lesions (L adrenal, L kidney).
CT head stable on [**3-22**].
Sputum was obtained on [**3-22**] given worsening hypoxemia and thick secretions, grew Moraxella and ceftriaxone was started.
A repeat speech and swallow evaluation showed evidence of aspiration with deficits consistent with neurological deficit and it was decided to proceed with PEG tube placement on [**3-31**].
#Dysphagia, left sided weakness - likely [**2-9**] giant PICA aneurysm.
-discharge to PT for rehab -would benefit from repeat swallow study once strenght improved to determine if dysphagia resolves.
She had a urinalysis sent on [**4-16**] which did not show any evidence of UTI.
Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia: Her baseline hematocrit is mid 20's with a ferritin of 6.
Outside hospital records were obtained for EGD and colonscopy in [**6-15**] which showed only ischemic colonic ulcer.
She should receive a colonoscopy to evaluate the iron deficiency anemia.
EGD performed during PEG placement revealed duodenitis for which she was placed on lansoprazole through the PEG tube.
Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma: These were identified on Abdominal CT with concern for malignancy.
An abdominal MRI was attempted, but she was unable to tolerate this due to difficulty holding breath for extended periods of time.
She will need an outpatient MRI for further characterization sometime in near future once her respiratory status is stable enough to tolerate lying flat.
PVD: Had evidence of ischemic colitis in [**2188-6-8**] and a BMS was placed in SMA on [**8-15**].
Citalopram was started empirically.
A TSH was checked which was elevated at 7.1 with normal FT4 likely due to either sick euthyroid or subclinical hypothyroidism.
She will need repeat TSH to determine cause and whether treatment is needed.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 100 % Powder [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
She has thick secretions and requires assistance with chest PT and suctioning to clear secretions.
Please inform you doctor or return to ED if you experience loss of vision, blurring, double vision, half vision, slurring of speech or difficulty finding correct words to use, severe headache or worsening headache not controlled by pain medication, sudden change in the ability to move or use your arm or leg or the ability to feel your arm or leg, trouble swallowing, breathing, or talking, numbness, coldness or pain in lower extremities, temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours.
Followup Instructions: Please call your primary care doctor as your CT scan of the chest this hospital admission indicates emphysema.
You also had some abnormal findings on your CT scan that requires follow-up with an abdominal MRI.
