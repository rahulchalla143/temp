He was admitted to the floor o/n, with normal BPs and HR in 100s, and was found to have continuing dropping HCT 29 on admission -> 23 -> 1UPRBC -> 19.9 in setting of severe thrombocytopenia.
Initial evaluation in the ED for DIC was negative (see hematology note) and he was felt to have either drug induced TP, ITP or HIT (no evidence of thromboses).
He was started on Prednisone 50mg given 4U FFP and 5mg Vit K to reverse the INR (3.7->2.0).
Per discussion with patient and Admission notes, he was in USOH at rehab until AM of admission, when he noticed small red dots all over his legs, which proliferated through the day.
He was initially taken [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital, then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Heme reviewed peripheral smear which did not reveal schistocytes and thought this to be secondary to drug reaction or ITP and advised to wait on transfusing plt, reverse INR, and start prednisone 50mg Daily."

Upon admission to the floor, the patient's Hct dropped from 28.9 to 23.3 on [**2102-7-10**].
There was no evidence of hemolysis: per Heme, no sign of hemolysis on smear, labs not suggestive of hemolysis.
Aspirin and coumadin were held and the patient was given vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.
A CT scan on [**2102-7-10**] showed a large fluid collection in the right transversalis muscle measuring 6.9 cm (AP) x 3.4 cm (transverse) x 13.1 cm (CC), most consistent with a retroperitoneal hematoma.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE:  The patient arrived with severe thrombocytopenia, with a plt count less than 5K.
A Coomb's test was negative.
The HIT Ab came out as being mildly positive (patient had Hx of hep on [**6-27**] at rehab), but the likelihood of having HIT was deemdd low.
The patient was transfused with a goal plt count of > 50.
An HIV test was negative.
The INR drifted downwards during admission, and eventually reached 1.1 by the time he was called out to the floor.
Per discussion with outside surgeon, the coumadin was to be held until further evaluation for the need of anticoagulation.
Pain was the most pressing issue regarding his condition, and was addressed with fentanyl patch, gabapentin, and prn dilaudid.
EF 50-55% at OSH ~ 2mo ago.
Has hypokinesis of basal inferolateral flow on echo in [**Month (only) 547**].
Liquid Antacid 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) mL PO every four (4) hours as needed for heartburn.
Your blood count stabilized and your platelet count returned to a normal level, and you were transferred back to the regular floor.
We stopped on of your blood thinners, Coumadin, because you had a large bleed.
