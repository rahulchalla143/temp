He was transferred to an outside hospital where on CT scan, he was found to have a grade IV liver laceration.
His white count was high.
On repeat CT scan, he was noted to have increasing collections in his abdomen around the liver and the splenic bed.
Despite all of these measures, the patient continued to present with multiorgan failure which did not improve but gradually was worsening.
As his multiorgan failure continued to progress, including worsening renal failure, he underwent a trial of CVVH which he tolerated well and after which he seemed to be improving for a short period of time.
The day prior to his death, hemodialysis was attempted and 500 cc were removed, but overall he was deteriorating.
