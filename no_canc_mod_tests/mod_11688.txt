The patient was started on heparin and nitroglycerin at the outside hospital and was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for cardiac catheterization for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission, the patient had a temperature of 98.7, pulse 56, blood pressure 135/74 and oxygen saturation 92% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission CK was 67, white blood cell count 10.9, hematocrit 45.3, platelet count 231,000, calcium 10.3, phosphorous 5, albumin 4.6, magnesium 2.1, sodium 141, potassium 4.7, chloride 100, bicarbonate 32, BUN 32, creatinine 1.3 and glucose 96.
CKs at the outside hospital were 175, 476 and 327 with a peak of 476 at 2:19 in the morning on [**2126-11-8**].
MBs were 10.3, 54.5 and 38.5 respectively with an MB index of 5.89, 11.45 and 11.77.
It showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 29 with cardiac output of 2.78, left ventricular pressure 160/21, pulmonary artery pressure elevated at 62/34.
Left ventriculography was not performed due to elevated filling pressures.
Coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with a normal left main, diffuse 60% mid-left anterior descending artery, 80% diagonal one, 70% proximal left circumflex with 99% mid to distal right coronary artery, it filled mainly via left-to-right collaterals.
Given this and his slightly low blood pressure compared to baseline, the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit service and had a cardioversion in the Coronary Care Unit with 200 joules times one.
The repeat catheterization showed diffusely diseased left main, a diffusely diseased, 70%, left anterior descending artery after the large competitive flow in distal left anterior descending artery and diagonal, left circumflex with 70% ostial stenosis with severe diffuse disease and competitive flow in obtuse marginal, totally occluded right coronary artery in the mid-portion, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery 90% aorto-ostial stenosis with a TIMI-II flow, saphenous vein graft to diagonal patent with mild kinking in mid-portion, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 30% ostial, left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery mild kinking in mid-graft and near anastomosis.
He did not have any recurrent atrial fibrillation and his rate was controlled on amiodarone in addition to low dose Lopressor 12.5 mg twice a day.
The patient has a known left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% and was subsequently placed on afterload reduction with Captopril which he had been on previously.
The patient had no further episodes of chest pain, however, it was thought he would benefit from a functional study on [**2126-11-22**].
The patient's blood sugars were well controlled on the insulin drip.
Cardiac catheterization with balloon angioplasty and stenting of a saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery lesion.
Arteriovenous fistula, to be evaluated as an outpatient.
