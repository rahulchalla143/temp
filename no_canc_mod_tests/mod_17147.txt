CT scan of abdomen showed an enhancement and wall thickening involving the rectum and distal sigmoid colon consistent with an infectious inflammatory process.
She was restarted on flagyl for possible culture negative c diff.
ABG was 7.25/61/78.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**4-7**]: Improved aeration of right lower lobe with persistent retrocardiac opacity consistent with known left lower lobe pneumonia.
KUB [**4-7**]: Bowel gas pattern most consistent with ileus.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**4-6**]: 1.
CXR [**4-5**]: Status post sternotomy and aortic repair, with stable mediastinal appearance.

Chest CT and CXR showed LLL and also R basilar PNA.
The stitches around her trach site should be removed on [**4-11**] per the thoracic surgery team.
3. s/p aortic dissection repair- CT read shows a well-seated graft.
Cardiac surgery reviewed her CT scan.
Colitis- She continued her treatment for c.diff colitis (culture negative, ct scan suggestive) until [**2191-4-8**].
Her INR was subtherapeutic on discharge.
She was monitored on telemetry and was rate-controlled during her stay here.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed: titrate to goal INR [**1-1**].
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Month/Day (3) **]: Ten (10) ml PO BID (2 times a day).
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution [**Month/Day (3) **]: One (1) Injection TID (3 times a day) for 4 days: until INR >2.0.
Please titrate coumadin to INR of 2.0-3.0; stop heparin SC once INR therapeutic.
Metoprolol was stopped as patient's blood pressure was low.
