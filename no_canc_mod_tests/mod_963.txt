Physical examination in the Emergency Department her temperature was 97.1 with a pulse of 101 and a blood pressure of 205/85.
Repeat blood pressure was 165 systolic.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature 98.7.
Pulse 82 to 87.
Blood pressure 150 to 170/70 to 80.
Respiratory rate 16.
Pulse ox 97% on room air.

Sodium 139, potassium 5.1, which was hemolyzed.
Repeat potassium was within normal limits.
Chloride 101, bicarbonate 29, BUN 14, creatinine 0.8 and glucose 126.
Prior studies and echocardiogram from [**2149-4-18**] showed an EF of greater then 60%, moderate mitral regurgitation, minimal aortic stenosis.
A Holter monitor study from [**2143-4-18**] showed no evidence of arrhythmia.
An exercise treadmill test from [**2141-8-18**] showed a total exercise time of 8.5 minutes 100% maximal heart rate, no anginal symptoms or electrocardiogram evidence of myocardial infarction.
Her hematocrit was 21 down from a baseline of 34, but the patient was hemodynamically stable.
Her vital signs again remained stable.
The patient was subsequently sent for angiography, which revealed no evidence of acute bleeding and there was no acute intervention.
The patient's hematocrit on the following morning was 23 showing the patient had only bumped one point despite being transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Given her continued bleeding without a clear source, the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
Over the next several days the patient received an additional 5 units of packed red blood cells bringing her hematocrit up to the low 30.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient underwent an upper endoscopy, which revealed no source of bleeding in the esophagus, stomach or upper small bowel.
She also underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed pan diverticulosis throughout the [**Year (4 digits) 499**].
The patient's hematocrit stabilized at approximately 30 to 32.
Following the transfer to the floor the patient remained hemodynamically stable with no further bleeding and stabilization of her hematocrit at approximately 30.
Renal:  The patient's creatinine and electrolytes were within normal limits on this admission.
