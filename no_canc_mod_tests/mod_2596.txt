PICC placement report: PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The patient was placed supine on the angiography table.
A preprocedural timeout was performed to confirm the patient's identity and the type of procedure to be performed.
Ultrasound was used to identify the right brachial vein which was patent and compressible.
Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous access documenting patency.
ECHO [**2112-2-20**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Pt had blood cultures growing coag neg staph and enterococcus in blood cx.
Sensitivities of the enteroccus species showed vancomycin sensitivity.
After his initial positive blood cx on [**2-18**] remaining surveillance cultures were negative.
He was discharged back to [**Location (un) **] manor with 2 weeks of IV Vancomycin and directions for surveillance cultures after treatment.
