CT head demonstrated left acute subdural hematoma.
He had not been receiving warfarin at rehab due to supratherapeutic INR last 2.3.
Vitals at that time were 140/81 94 98% RA.
He was transferred to teh [**Hospital1 18**] ED and initially he was able to follow commands but did not open his eyes with initial vitals 85 157/80 18 100% RA.
CT showed a left sided acute SDH with midline shift and edema.
INR was 2.1 and he was reversed.
He progresively declined such that he would initially groan and intermittently follow commands and latterly at the time of my assessment became unresponsive to sternal rub preceded by fidgety movements of the hands and latterluy extensor posturing in the UE with GCS 4 E1 V1 M2.
HE also had a hypertensive spiek with HR stable/borderlien bradycardic and SBP 190s -200s.
He was intubated in the ED and repeat scan showed a possible bleeding vessel with considerable enlargememnt in the ASDH and worse midline shift.

[**2141-12-2**] CT cervical spine: No fracture or malalignment  [**2141-12-2**] 21:48  CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
Areas of decreased diffusion in the left cerebellar hemisphere, corresponding to the previously noted hypodense area on CT studies.
Persistent left subdural fluid collection, with pneumocephalus causing mass effect on the cerebral hemispheres, along with post-surgical changes and fluid collection in the soft tissues, not significantly changed compared to the recent CT head study.
Improvement in the mass effect on the left lateral ventricle compared to the prior CT head study.
[**2141-12-3**] MRI Cervical Spine: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**12-4**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: Status post evacuation of subdural hematoma with small amount of residual or procedure related hemorrhage and fluid.
[**12-10**] MRI Brain: unchanged from previous MRI brain.
[**12-10**] Chest Xray portable: FINDINGS: The ET tube is 3 cm above the carina.
[**12-11**] Chest xray: Since [**2141-12-10**] pulmonary vascular congestion has improved and there is no pulmonary edema  [**12-12**]: Chest xray stable  [**12-17**]: CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2141-12-20**] 3:18 AM FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube ends approximately 5.5 cm above the carina and is adequately placed.
CXR [**2141-12-22**] Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.8 cm above the carina, left PICC line ends at lower SVC, and orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach, though distal end is beyond the radiograph, all are appropriate.
Changed but with evolution of blood products.
[**2141-12-31**] CT head noncontrast IMPRESSION: 1.
Fluid collection at the site of the suboccipital craniectomy stable in appearance, with no rim-enhancement to suggest infection.
Bilateral mastoid effusions with fluid-opacification of the left middle ear cavity, as on the MR study of [**2141-12-23**].
[**2142-1-1**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**12-31**], there is no change in the appearance of the tracheostomy, though it is difficult to evaluate given the obliquity of the patient.
Unchanged tracheostomy tube, unchanged left central venous access line, unchanged ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
[**2142-1-3**] CXR 1.
Possible new left small pleural effusion or consolidation for which an upright radiograph is necessary for further evaluation  [**2142-1-4**] CXR Previously reported questionable left pleural effusion or consolidation is no longer evident.
[**2142-1-5**] CXR In comparison with the study of [**1-4**], the tracheostomy tube remains in place and there is pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
His coagulopathy was reversed with FFP, initial INR 2.1 and subsequent post transfusion INR of 1.4.
His exam slowly improved to withdrawal of all 4 extremities and purposeful left arm movement.
On [**12-6**] the patient's neurological exam was stable but poor.
His EEG monitoring continued and was negative for active seizures.
On [**12-7**] vent settings were being weaned and neurological exam was stable.
EEG was again negative for seizures on current regimen.
On [**12-10**] the patient's mental status continued to be depressed with a minimal exam and so he underwent an MRI of the brain to assess for the possibility of new strokes.
MRI was stable and did not show new strokes.
His dilantin level was corrected at 9 therefore his standing dose was increased.
On [**12-14**] his dilantin level was 8.3 corrected so he was bolused 500mg of fosphenytoin.
This self resolved and a neuromedicine consult was called and EEG was continued.
His exam was stable and he had no seizures overnight into [**12-19**].
Neurology recommended an MRI to evaluate the patient for possible worsening infarct which might be a source of the EEG findings.
Dilantin level was sent which was 9.8.
A chest xray was performed which showed improvement in atelectasis and consolidation.
On [**1-1**] the patient was febrile to 102.3 and a fever workup was inititated.
On [**1-8**] his Dilantin level 18.4 corrected and he had continued drainage fro his trach site.
cultures were sent and his antibiotics were changed to nafcillin only.
On [**1-9**] his Dilantin level was 16.8 corrected he and recieved a 500g Dilantin Bolus.
