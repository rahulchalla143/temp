The patient was noted to have a blood sugar of 300, a bicarbonate level of 19, and an anion gap of 29.
The drip was stopped on the morning of [**4-17**] after the patient's anion gap had resolved and blood sugars normalized.
She was noted to have lateral electrocardiogram changes but denied any substernal chest pain.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination the patient had a temperature of 99, blood pressure of 140/64, a pulse of 75, respiratory rate of 15, saturating at 95% to 97% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the patient had bilateral eyelid edema.
On cardiovascular examination she had a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur over the left lower sternal border.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data revealed the patient had a white blood cell count of 8.4, hematocrit of 34.1, platelet count of 229.
She had a sodium of 143, potassium of 3.9, chloride of 110, bicarbonate of 24, blood urea nitrogen of 11, creatinine of 0.7, blood glucose of 99.
She had an anion gap of 9.
Albumin of 2.9, calcium of 8.6, phosphate of 2.4, magnesium of 1.9, lipase of 8, amylase of 143.
She had an AST of 98, an ALT of 27.
Her creatine kinases were 194, 73, and 55.
Her troponin I was 2.9, 5.7, and 4.1.
Her FK 506 level was low at 5.4.
Microbiologic data revealed the patient had blood cultures times two cytomegalovirus antigen; all of which were pending.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   She had a chest x-ray which was negative for an acute cardiopulmonary process.
She had  a KUB which revealed no evidence of obstruction of perforation.
She had an electrocardiogram which revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 85.
We followed her creatinine closely.
Her troponin levels peaked at 5.7 and subsequently decreased gradually.
She was initially monitored on telemetry and had daily electrocardiograms checked.
We obtained both stool studies and cytomegalovirus antigen, all of which were pending.
Her blood sugars were monitored every two hours as were her electrolytes.
This resulted in a marked improvement in her blood sugars.
The patient subsequently had appropriate control of her blood sugars on 22 units of Lantus at bedtime.
