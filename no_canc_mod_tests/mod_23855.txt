CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK: The CT angiography of the neck demonstrates occlusion of the right internal carotid artery just beyond the carotid bulb.
The linear density seen distal to it on the reformatted images appears to be due to an external carotid branch.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD:  The CT angiography of the head demonstrates occlusion of the internal carotid artery in the petrous and cavernous portion.
CT PERFUSION HEAD:  The CT perfusion of the head demonstrates a large area of increased transit time in the region of right middle cerebral artery.
However, on the blood volume images, subtle areas of low blood volume are seen around the sylvian region, but there are no corresponding abnormalities identified to the mean transit time defect.
Head CT shows dense right middle cerebral artery, indicative of a thrombus.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates occlusion of the right internal carotid artery just beyond the carotid bulb, likely due to a thrombus.
CT perfusion of the head demonstrates a large area of mean transit time defect with small areas of slightly decreased blood volume, indicative of a large area of ischemia with probable small infarcts.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates occlusion of the petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid internal carotid and the proximal right M1 segment.
Blood flow is seen in the sylvian branches likely secondary to collaterals.
CT head [**4-30**] New intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter at the level of the third ventricle on the right.
CT head [**5-2**] FINDINGS: There is a large region of hypodensity involving the right frontal lobe, insula, temporal lobe, basal ganglia and surrounding deep white matter, corresponding to the evolving acute infarct seen on the prior MRI.
CT head [**5-3**] FINDINGS: The extensive confluent hypodensity within the right frontal lobe, insula, right temporal lobe and basal ganglia appear similar in extent and distribution to the prior examination, consistent with known right MCA infarct.
The degree of shift of normally-midline structures is not significantly changed from the prior examination measuring up to 5 mm, compared with 4 mm previously.
Chest X ray [**4-30**] There is probable background hyperinflation.
Humerus AP and L , left [**2168-4-30**] LEFT ARM, TWO VIEWS:  In fact, both views are obtained in similar positions.
Forearm AP and L, left [**4-30**]  IMPRESSION:  1.
ECHO [**5-2**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
MRI/A head and neck [**2168-5-4**]: Since the prior angiographic studies, there has been apparent recanalization of the right middle cerebral artery, with symmetric appearance of the vessels compared to the contralateral side and appropriate distal branching pattern.
MRA OF THE NECK: There is irregularity of the lumen within the right distal cervical internal carotid artery in an area of vessel tortuosity, which is different than the contralateral side.
The T1 fat saturated images are not definitive in terms of dissection.
Trans-esophageal echo [**2168-5-5**]: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT/CTA head and neck was done which did not show any acute bleed, however it showed dense right MCA sign and occlusion of internal carotid artery just distal to carotid bulb.
Interventional Neuroradiology was consulted, he underwent emergent cerebral angiogram which showed occlusion of right ICA distal to carotid bulb and some occlusion in M1 segment of right MCA.
He was observed for signs of edema and raised ICP such as drowsiness, vomiting, headache, which he did not have.
The patient had a repeat MRA of the head an neck which showed an area of irregularity in the right internal carotid that was possibly a healing area of dissection.
The decision was made to start the patient on Coumadin for an INR of [**12-23**].
He will stay on his aspirin until he attains an INR between [**12-23**] and then the aspirin can be stopped.
Cards He was closely monitored on telemetry for any evidence of atrial fibrillation, which did not show any evidence.
Cardiac enzymes and EKG was  negative for any evidence of acute ischemia.
LDL was 65.
TTE was done to evaluate for evidence of clot or shunt, which was negative.
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: for goal INR of [**12-23**], once achieved can stop aspirin.

To work up your stroke we had an trans-esophageal echocardiogram of your heart which was normal.
We had a repeat MRI of you [**Doctor Last Name **] and the blood vessels in your neck and the was an area concerning for stenosis or dissection and the decision was made to place you on coumadin.
Your secondary prevention workup noted a normal test for diabetes HgbA1c=5.7 and an LDL of 65 You continued to make improvements and will be discharged to an acute rehab facility.
Your medications were changed as follows: Coumadin was started Aspirin was started (it will be stopped when you are theraapeutic on coumadin)   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with: Provider: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3445**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**] Date/Time:[**2168-6-6**] 2:00 on [**Location (un) 8661**] 8 - [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] of [**Hospital1 18**]  Please follow up with your PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9386**]
