Temperature 102.2 rectally, blood pressure 110/60, heart rate 145, respiratory rate 44, 98% on 100% nonrebreather.
Chest x-ray on arrival was concerning for a volvulus with fine air under the diaphragm.
ET tube placement complicated by profound hypotension to systolic blood pressures of 35/18.
Hypotensive systolic blood pressure 30s to 60s for approximately 20 minutes before blood pressure increased with 3.5 liters of normal saline and Levophed drip.
He was taken to CT scan but progressively difficult to ventilate.
The CT showed no obstruction, no volvulus, no events of ischemia.
Repeat laboratories showed a decrease in the white blood cell count from 21 to 18 and his bicarbonate decreased from 36 to 32, lactate 2.2.
The patient was taken to the MICU where an A line was placed, given 2.3 units of FFP for an INR of 3.6 and a right IG catheter was placed.
CVP after about 5 liters produced urine output to about 80 cc per hour.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.6, blood pressure 77-120 systolic/30-51 diastolic, respiratory rate 30-40, pulse 102, ventilator AC 550 times 14, FI02 1.0, PEEP 5.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cell count 21, hematocrit 33, platelets 354,000.
Sodium 146, potassium 2.6, chloride 96, bicarbonate 36, BUN 42, creatinine 1.2, glucose 206, INR 3.6, PTT 105.6, calcium 8.5, phosphorus 4.0, magnesium 2.0.
Chest x-ray showed left effusion, small lung volumes, mild CHF.
EKG showed rapid atrial fibrillation without any ST changes.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  There were multiple etiologies including COPD, restrictive lung disease due to a scoliosis, and it is believed that at baseline the patient's 02 saturations are in the 90s and he is a C02 retainer.
SEPSIS:  The patient grew out four out of four blood cultures Enterococcus.
We continued to follow his Dilantin levels which are prophylactic procedures which he had on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].
HEMATOCRIT:  The patient had an acute decrease when admitted of his hematocrit from 34 to 24, unclear if this was dilutional from the fluid that he received but his hematocrit remained stable in the 28s to 30s range since.
The CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
His heparin was being held at this time but the patient should be anticoagulated for concerns of his atrial fibrillation and the question of whether he had an embolic stroke.
