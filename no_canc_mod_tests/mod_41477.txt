[**2119-7-3**] CT Head w/o con: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or territorial infarction.
CT head negative for bleed, stroke, or other acute process.
Tox screen negative and no metabolic abnormalities.
EEG negative for seizure activity.
Patient was treated empirically with vanc/zosyn which were discontinued when there were no signs of infection (UA negative, CXR negative, blood cultures no growth to date).
Patient was initially on pressors and was empirically on vanc/zosyn which were later discontinued after all cultures and CXR were negative for infectious process.
Patient was given IVF, narcotics were held, and her BP improved and she was weaned off the pressors.
