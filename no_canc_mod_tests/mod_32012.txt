A stat TTE revealed pericardial effusion and tamponade.
A repeat tte showed trivial effusion.
He was continued on the amiodarone drip as well as a diltiazem drip for rate and rhythm control, and transitioned to oral amiodarone and oral diltiazem.
Further evaluation was deferred until pt given time to recover.
In the setting of this new CHF and positive fluid balance and minimal urine output, pt became significantly volume overloaded with new pulmonary edema.
On discharge, CXR was improved, but BNP was still elevated.
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of obstruction but a 0.2 cm right kidney angiomyolipoma.
Chronic L-leg pain: Was maintained on his longstanding home narcotic regimen.
