Physical exam was notable for left leg with 2+edema.
Notable labs included a proBNP of 1540, Trop-T <0.01, Hct 33.5, PT 13.2, PTT 26.3, and INR of 1.2.
The patient also had a guaiac negative stool.
The patient also received a CT of the chest w/ and w/o contrast, and the preliminary read demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli extending from the main pulmonary artery at the level of the bifurcation into both the upper and lower pulmonary arteries bilaterally.
EKG in the ED was unremarkable, and the patient received a heparin bolus was started on a heparin drip.
Of note, the patient received a work-up for a hypercoagulable state by his PCP back in [**2175**] including tests for lupus anticoagulant, antithrombin III, Protein C, anti-cardiolipin, and Protein S of which Protein C studies returned borderline positive.

Follow up with CT in [**3-25**] months is recommended.
ECG Study Date of [**2183-7-3**]  7:11:54 PM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2175-5-29**] heart rate is faster.
Otherwise, no other significant diagnostic change  Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2183-7-4**] at 2:15:56 PM      FINAL The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2175-5-17**], right ventricle now appears large and hypokinetic.
Pulmonary pressures were not previously assessed.
CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2183-7-4**] 5:22 PM FINDINGS:  ABDOMEN:  The visualized lung bases are clear of nodules, consolidations or effusions.
Noncontrast evaluation of the abdomen demonstrates no new hepatic lesions.
Given his h/o SMA thrombosis, clots in both arterial and venous systems suggest considering Protein C def/ antiphospholipid antibody syndrome as a unify etiology of his emboli.
However, labs at admission show an MCV of 80 and a Hct of 33.5.
non-con CT of abd/pelvis did not show RP bleed.
Na 136 today AM.
TSH 1.2.
His glucose improved when the drip was stopped and he was restarted on metformin and Glyburide.
Follow up with CT in [**3-25**] months is recommended.

You are being discharged on Lovenox shots twice a day, which you must continue until you are told to stop by your PCP when your Warfarin has reached a therapeutic blood level (INR [**2-21**]).
You should go to your PCP's office in 2 days for a blood test.
Since you had a blood clot and have a history of possible predisposition to clotting, as well as the fact that you seem to have iron deficiency anemia despite a diagnosis of hemochromatosis in the past, you have been referred to [**Hospital **] clinic.
Finally, because you have a history of hepatitis and liver disease, you should have a screening liver ultrasound and blood test (AFP).
Followup Instructions: ANTICOAGULATION Please go to Dr.[**Name (NI) 16936**] office and get your blood drawn (INR checked) on Wednesday [**2183-7-9**].
