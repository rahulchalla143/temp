Sinus tachycardia, his rate was controlled with Lopressor, which was titrated up to 150 mg b.i.d.
It was a sinus tach secondary to a hypovolemia after his last skin graft at the end of [**Month (only) 205**], which is believed to have caused his non ST elevation myocardial infarction, so his rate was maintained with the Lopressor at a baseline in the 90s to low 100s with a baseline blood pressure of 80 to 90s/50s to 60s.
Lovenox and Coumadin were overlapped until they became therapeutic on his Coumadin and INR between 2 and 3 at which point the Lovenox was discontinued.
A culture from the PICC line tip was sent, which on [**2171-8-19**] revealed an MRSA culture greater then 15 colonies.
At this point the patient still had no evaluated white count and his highest temperature was 100.4.
The patient's white count had still be stable and not elevated.
On [**8-21**] it is 6.2 and his temperature today is 99.3.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  During his hospital course when admitted to the Medical Service on a intravenous fluids of normal saline with 40 milliequivalents of potassium chloride and was on Boost for breakfast, lunch and dinner and house diet.
The patient over the course of his hospital stay gradually started taking better po, drinking his Boost and eating his meals and his urine output was adequate and he did have adequate bowel movements.
On [**2171-8-13**] the patient was transfused one unit of red blood cells, because of concern that his sinus tachycardiac might be due to his decreased oxygen delivery with his substantial wound healing.
His hematocrit increased the next day to 32.7.
His anemia is likely an anemia of chronic disease as iron studies were drawn and laboratories were consistent with this picture.
The plan is for Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is to follow up at his rehabilitation hospital to eventually wean him off of his PCA and to discontinue the intravenous Vancomycin once his blood cultures come back from [**8-19**] and he is to see the attending surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks for follow up to discuss the next skin graft, which should be in a few months.
