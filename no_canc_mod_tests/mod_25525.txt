His SBP was noted to be 80 with hct of 21.9 (down from 32.2 just one day prior to that at time of discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]).
White count was 48 (increased from 13).
KUB was negative for free air, per report.
Follow-up CT showed possible SBO.
SBP dropped to 40s and code blue was called.
In addition patient was noted to have melanotic stools in the setting of becoming increasingly coagulopathic with most recent INR 3.3 and PTT 78.
His vitals at time of [**Location (un) **] transfer are BP 119/87, HR 117, sat 100% on FiO2 50%.
Most recent ABG was 7.3/38/138.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for sepsis from a presumed pulmonary source (vancomycin/levofloxacin/Zosyn); in the end he completed a 7-day course of [**Name (NI) **]/Zosyn and was discharged to complete a 14-day course of vancomycin for GPC bacteremia (peptostreptococcus on blood culture from [**4-24**] with negative surveillance cultures).
His hematocrit at time of discharge was 32, with white count of 13.

Additionally, his platelets were falling and INR/PTT were rising.
He was transfused aggressively with blood products to maintain hct greater than 25, platelets greater than 50, INR greater than 2, and fibrinogen greater than 200.
Patient was started on CVVHD when serial ABGs revealed worsening acidemia.
His liver enzymes improved and then worsened on the second and third hospital day.
# Elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes.
Patient had elevated troponins and EKG changes suggestive of global ischemia.
Electrolytes were repleted aggressively.
Unfortunately echocardiogram could not be obtained given his clinical instability.
