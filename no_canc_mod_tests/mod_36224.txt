CT head w/o contrast: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
EEG: This is an abnormal VEEG telemetry due to the presence of a generalized slow background rhythm of [**3-10**] Hz, with frequent periods of [**5-12**] theta activity, indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Video swallow test ([**2101-8-19**]): Aspiration with all liquid consistencies with oropharyngeal residue after swallow.
Video swallow test ([**2101-8-23**]): No aspiration or penetration is seen with multiple consistencies of barium.

There was concern for poor airway protection, so he was intubated.
EEG and CT head were obtained to rule out intracranial bleed and seizure, which were negative.
Metobolic workup was all negative.
Blood cultures were negative.
CXR showed RLL pneumonia, so patient was started empirically on vancomycin + aztreonem + levofloxacin + flagyl for  ventilator-associated pneumonia.
Sputum culture showed H. influenza and beta Streptococci, thus he was narrowed to levofloxain, and completed a 7day course prior to discharge.
3) Aspiration: Initial video speech and swallow exam on the floor showed aspiration of liquids.
Repeat video swallow showed no more aspiration and patient was placed on thin liquid with crushed solid diet.
He refused an EGD and after discussion with his legal guardian [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 108882**], the decision was made to perform the EGD as an outpatient.
4) Skin blisters on left back: There was concern for shinles at first, thus DFA, viral cultures, and HSZ/VZV serologies were sent, which came negative.
We were worried that you were having a stroke so when you got the hospital, we got a CT scan of your head which did no show any signs of bleeding.
The neurologists also did an EEG exam to make sure you were not having a seizure.
After two days, you gained your strength and the speech and swallow doctors decided that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were no longer aspirating food.
