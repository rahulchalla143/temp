She also notes constipation x3 mos leading to painful straining and bloody stools, which was evaluated by flex sig at OSH showing hemorrhoids.
Since admission, CT was done and showed pancolitis.
GI was consulted and did upper endoscopy which was normal.
Cardiac markers showed trop peak at 0.41 with CK/CKMB normal and no EKG changes.
This was done today showing systolic and diastolic dysfunction (LVEF 20-30%) with a small effusion and possible early tamponade.

[**2102-8-15**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
Would recommend imaging correlation such as colonoscopy or barium study as available.
Colonic wall thickening and mucosal enhancement, related to colitis as seen on recent CT scan.
A followup MRI is suggested in six months for further evaluation.
[**2102-8-17**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left filling pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg and an LVEDP of 28 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.3 l/min/m2.
The central aortic pressure was 103/68 mmHg.
