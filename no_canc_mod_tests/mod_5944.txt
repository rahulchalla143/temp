He was found to have a heart rate in the 20s to 30s with a systolic in the 100s to 110s.
Systolic pressures dropped into the 70s and the patient was transcutaneously paced on route to the hospital.
At the outside hospital the patient's potassium was found to be 8.0 and a creatinine of 2.5.
He was also given Digibind 5 vials for a Digoxin level of 1.0.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3.
Blood pressure 104/50.
Pulse 67.
Respiratory rate 21.
Sating 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Skin examination the patient has warm, dry skin with a slightly raised pink macular papular rash over his abdomen and some linear petechia on his lower extremities bilaterally.
LABORATORIES AT THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White blood cell count 13.6, hematocrit 35.6, platelets 371, potassium 8.0, BUN 53, creatinine 2.8, glucose 201.
On arrival at the [**Hospital1 346**] the patient's white count 9.2, 72% polys, 15% lymphocytes, hematocrit 31.7, platelets 301, potassium 6.2, BUN 49, creatinine 2.6, coags normal.
First CK 46, calcium 9.4, phos 5.0, magnesium 2.7, potassium 6.4.
Chest x-ray revealed pulmonary edema.
Arterial blood gas 7.39, 33, 64 on 2 liters nasal cannula.
He will need an outpatient stress test at some point to determine if there is any new inducible ischemia after his previous coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient was bolused with normal saline, 250 cc during the first two days of hospitalization with good improvement in his urine and his blood pressure and urine output.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout.
Repeat echocardiogram revealed an EF of 20%, multiple regional wall motion abnormalities.
No significant change since echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 958**] at outside hospital.
The patient's magnesium was repleted and the patient had no further ectopy.
Cardiologist was notified and the patient may need EP study ICD in the near future.
On obtaining further records the patient's creatinine was 1.2 in [**Month (only) 205**] and then increased to 1.9 early this year.
The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 2.8.
The patient's creatinine continued to improve from 2.6 down to 2, eventually down to 1.4 and then upon discharge the patient's creatinine was 1.0.
The patient also had a renal ultrasound, which was negative for obstruction, however, revealed a question of an echogenic mass in the left upper pole.
The patient will need an MRI of his kidney to further elucidate what this is, although likely represents a duplication of the collecting system.
The patient's urinalysis and urine cultures were negative.
Phena was less then .3 indicating a prerenal picture again with cessation of renal toxin medications and gentle fluids, the patient's creatinine improved to baseline at 1.0.
FEN:  Patient was admitted with a potassium of 8.0 likely secondary to recently starting Aldactone, using Indocin for gout and worsening renal function.
The patient's potassium, Zestril, Aldactone and Indocin were held as the creatinine improved.
The patient's potassium was 6.4 in the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room, which decreased down to 5.7 and eventually down to 4.9 and upon discharge the patient's potassium was 4.2.
The patient's Foley was discontinued with good urine output and continued decrease in his creatinine.
Per some family members the patient was deemed unsafe to return home, however, after psychiatric consultation was obtained and further discussion with the family all parties felt that it was safe for the patient to go home on his prn Xanax to follow up as an outpatient for further neurocognitive testing to workup the diagnosis of question of dementia.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician regarding further neuropsychiatric testing and MRI of his head and workup of left upper pole renal mass with MRI versus CT of the abdomen and kidneys.
The patient needs his potassium and creatinine checked in one week or the patient needs an electrocardiogram in one week for evidence of heart block/bradycardia.
The patient is also to follow up with his cardiologist for management of his cardiac medications, future exercise stress testing and a possible electrophysiology study and internal cardiac defibrillator.
