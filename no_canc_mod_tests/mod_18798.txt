Following work-up and being cleared by cardiology he was brought to the operating room where he underwent an off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x 2.
Echo in OR revealed only mild MR and therefore this was not repaired.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVIICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
