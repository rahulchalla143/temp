[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed  given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions: PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:   [**2191-7-11**] 06:25AM BLOOD Lipase-93*   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with Strep viridans mitral valve endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, and severe anemia.
1)MITRAL VALVE ENDOCARDITIS: Initial blood cultures remained positive for Streptococcus.
Echocardiogram was notable for partial anterior leaflet flail with a highly mobile, large (1.8 x 0.8cm) echogenic "mass" attached to the left atrial side of the anterior mitral leaflet c/w a vegetation.
A Head CT scan and back MRI revealed no evidence of septic emboli.
He underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed clean coronary arteries.
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR around 3.0.
Coumadin restarted while on argatroban and cleared for discharge on [**7-14**] Coumadin INR to be followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3003**]/[**Hospital3 **] Clinic.
