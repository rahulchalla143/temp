She had an EVD placed in the ED and was taken to the ICU for further care.
Over the course of her ICU stay she was intubated and started on Keppra prophylactically with IV agents for blood pressure control as her pressures were difficult to control (goal was less then 160) - for her final regimen see medications below.
She had a CT with vessel imaging that demonstrated significant stenosis in the left ICA.
This was confirmed on subsequent cerebral angiogram which failed to show evidence for vessel abnormalities known to cause such hemorrhages.
She had her EVD clamped at one moment after drainage on an open valve of 15 showed less then 200 cc over a 24 hour period.
A CT scan of the head demonstrated new intraventricular blood with serial CT scans demonstrating increase ventricular size.
Repeat head CT on [**2-11**] for presurgical planning revealed new left hemispheric infarcts, likely related to severe left carotid stenosis which had progressed to closure.
Pneumonia and Fever:   She was initially febrile and after multiple attempts to isolate an organism was found to grow pan sensitive Acinetobacter on sputum culture.
Medications on Admission: Enalapril 20mg daily Diclofenac 75mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Blood compressed your brain and spilled into the fluid filled spaces within your brain, necessitating drain placement.
