Admission Date:  [**2147-11-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-11-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Lipitor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7881**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: This is an 85-year-old nun with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and CAD, s/p CABG x 3 and stents in [**1-/2146**] and 10/[**2146**].
At OSHh she ruled in for a NSTEMI with a peak troponin of 0.95.
She underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday and was found to have a lesion in the SVG from the diag to the OM-1.
Her EF was reported as 25-30%.
Physical [**Year (4 digits) **]: VS - afebrile, 161/81, 68 18 98%2L Gen: WDWN middle aged female in NAD.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 8 cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
LV ventriculography was deferred.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated severe central hypertension (180/72 mm Hg).
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, 10% residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout (See PTCA comments).
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout (See PTCA comments).
Final angiographyc demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, 20% residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout (See PTCA comments).
Portable semi-upright chest radiograph is compared to the prior study.
CT abd/pelvis [**11-2**]: 1.
Retained renal contrast is compatible with acute tubular necrosis.
An EKG was done which showed some deeper TWI in V2-V6.
A CT abdomen was done which did not show any evidence of RP Bleed.
HCT was stable, nadir 18 but stable in the low 30s after surgical evacuation / repair.
Patients cardiac enzymes were also trended post-cath.
First set showed CK 73 (-->77).
Troponin was 0.21.
Troponin peak at 0.37, CK peak at 77.
Patient was subsequently stable from a cardiac standpoint and sent home on her home asa, plavix, [**Last Name (un) **] and beta blocker.
#.Systolic heart failure: Pt has CHF with EF 30%.
A an ECHO was done after her hematoma and hypotensive episode to make sure there was no evidence of pericardial effusion or new ischemia.
ECHO showed Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global/regional systolic dysfunction.
The CT abdomen on [**11-2**] demonstrated contrast in her kidneys and collecting ducts consistent with ATN.
2) Bradycardia: Patient stayed in NSR with a rate in the 60s.
4) Valve: Has a murmur on [**Month/Year (2) **] and ECHO notable for mild AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.2-1.9cm2).
Her BP subsequently remained stable.
#) HEMATOMA: On post-cath check initially, pt found to have a small hematoma which intially resolved by holding pressure and her Hct was stable.
She subsequently went to the OR where her Hct was found to be 18.
She began the OR with SBPs as high as 190 and a HR of 110; however, by the end of the procedure her SBPs were in the 100s-110s and her HR was in the 60s.
Her Hct remained stable after these tranfusions.

You underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed some occlusion in the grafts done from your previous CABG.
