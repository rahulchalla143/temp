During his workup he was found to have ST elevations and a subsequent cardiac cath at the outside hospital revealed a 40% left main lesion, 90% LAD lesion, 90% RCA lesion, and a 100% mid circumflex occlusion.
His ejection fraction was 45% at cardiac cath.
Carotid ultrasound showed no evidence of extensive disease.
His femoral artery was dressed without any hematoma, and his DP and PT pulses were normal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count of 7.1, hematocrit of 32.1, platelet count of 210,000.
PT of 11.2, PTT of 41.8, and INR of 0.8.
Urinalysis showed protein in his urine with some trace glucose and a small amount of blood, but no urinary tract infection.
Sodium of 143, K of 4.3, chloride of 110, bicarbonate of 27, BUN of 29, creatinine of 1.8 (which was up slightly from 127 earlier in the day), and a blood sugar of 90.
ALT of 9, AST of 14, LDH of 161, alkaline phosphatase of 78, total bilirubin of 0.2.
Albumin of 2.6.
Magnesium of 1.8.
RADIOLOGIC AND OTHER STUDIES:  Preoperative carotid series showed normal antegrade flow in the vertebral arteries bilaterally and mild plaque in the prophylaxis internal carotid arteries bilaterally with less than of 40% hemodynamic stenosis.
A MRI at the previous hospital showed a high-grade left carotid stenosis.
Persantine thallium on [**5-25**] showed a fixed defect apical/inferior left wall with a LVEF of 42%.
We elected to hold off on his surgery until his creatinine could stabilize, and he remained on a heparin drip.
On house day 3, his creatinine went from 1.8 down to 1.7 with a plan to have surgery on Tuesday and allow his creatinine to stabilize over the long holiday weekend.
His creatinine then dropped to 1.6.
He was on a nitroglycerin drip for blood pressure control.
Preoperative chest x-ray also showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
The following day his index was 3.6, white count of 19, hematocrit of 34.9, platelet count of 209,000, creatinine of 1.7.
His chest tubes remained in place.
His incisions - sternum and left leg - were clean, dry, and intact.
with a blood pressure of 160/80.
