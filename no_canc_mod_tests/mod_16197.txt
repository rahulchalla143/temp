On the normal medical floor your blood pressure dropped several times and it responded to IV fluids.
We think your blood pressure dropped due to a combination of tizanidine and baclofen.
You also had a decreased hematocrit and we do not know whether you had a bleed in your GI tract but we do know that your hematocrit is stable now.
