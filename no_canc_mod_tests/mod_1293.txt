In the ED he was placed on NRB with initial vital signs 97.1 HR:64 BP:142/81 RR:36 O2:99%.
He was then placed on BiPAP and vitals signs improved to HR:63 BP:120/64 RR:20 O2:100%.
Labs were significant for a BNP: [**Numeric Identifier 8068**], trop:0.04, CK:36, WBC: 15.5, lactate 2.4 creatinine 1.4.
The CXR showed mild vascular congestion, large left pleural effusion and ?opacity in the left base, likely atelectasis.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to extensive severe inferior and posterior wall hypokinesis/akinesis, apical dyskinesis, and hypokinesis of all other segments with relatively preserved function of the basal segments.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CHEST X-RAY ([**2135-1-21**]) IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary interstitial edema.
Read in conjunction with CT examination from [**2128**] which demonstrated concern possible left lower lobe lung mass, current radiograph is insensitive for confirmation, and correlation with interval imaging or a repeat CT examination can be performed as appropriate.
CXR showed large left pleural effusion and atelectasis vs consolidation in the left base.
He does have leukcytosis and elevated lactate and received vanco/levo/CTX while more data was obtained, however all cultures remained negative and urine legionella antigen was negative; no leukocytosis or fever was observed.
Speech therapy was consulted and video swallow with esophageal barium study were ordered.
CHF: Last ECHO showed EF 25% with severe hypokinesis.
Rate control achieved with carvedilol, we continued coumadin in house at a lower dose than his outpatient dose (as per daily INR value with a INR goal between [**1-19**])  .
CKD: Pt creatinine 1.4 and at recent baseline (1.3-1.4).
