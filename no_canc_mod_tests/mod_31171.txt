Bronch negative, U/S of lungs showed no pleural effusions, extubated without problem [**6-12**]: d/c NGT  CV: Given that she is not likely to be taking PO medications in the near future and was previously rhythm-controlled on sotalol, would favor short term use of amiodarone to control heart rate and rhythm.
- can give 150mg IV x 1 followed by 1mg/min IV infusion x 6 hours followed by 0.5mg/hour x 18 hours - please maintain INR between [**3-7**] if no evidence of bleeding; with heparin bridge if coumadin must be held or reversed for surgery - plan to discontinue amiodarone and resume sotalol once surgically stable and able to take POs.
