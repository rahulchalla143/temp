Repeat films showed multifocal infiltrates and it was felt she had either aspiration or atypical pna.
She was admitted and underwent an extensive pulmonary workup including multiple Chest CTs and trials on antibiotics/antifungals and antiviral medications.
Ultimately it was felt that she had an acute intersitial pneumonitis and will undergo a wedge biopsy to obtain lung tissue for pathologic diagnosis.

A high-resolution CT would be best suited to evaluate these lungs.

If she responds to PCP treatment, continue Prednisone titration per protocol (40mg [**Hospital1 **] x 5 days, 40mg q24h x 5 days, 20mg q24h x 11 days.)
3) If she does not improve (i.e., decreased FiO2 & improving CXR) within 3 days of initiating PCP treatment, would provide stress dose steroids (i.e., Solumedrol 1gm IV q24h x 3 days, followed by 50% titration q72h.)
5) Speech / swallow evaluation --> aspiration precautions as needed.
10) Ultimately, if she does not transfer back to [**Hospital1 1562**], obtaining her current culture data would be extremely helpful.
Their recommenations were as follows: -please obtain all records and microbiology data from [**Hospital1 1562**] -check LDH (eg, for PCP) -check serum glucan and galactomannan to assess for invasive fungal infection; would also check serum cryptococcal antigen and urine histoplasma antigen if not done at [**Hospital1 1562**] -check strongyloides serology, stool ova/parasites, and u/a to look for hematuria -if BAL to be done, would check for PCP DFA, gram stain and cx, fungal stain and cx, AFB stain and cx, galactomannan, and respiratory viral screen -if BAL not to be done, consider empirical treatment for PCP with TMP/SMX 15 mg/kg po/iv daily divided q8 hours -if above unrevealing or if she deteriorates, may conisder empirical therapy with Ambisome 3 mg/kg/day noting risk of renal toxicity -consider empirical therapy for strongyloides infection with ivermectin 200 mcg/kg po daily x 2 consecutive days; if disseminated disease is documented, may need longer course  The patient was made a DNR/DNI by the ICU physician after discussion with the patient.
Because her initial workup began at [**Hospital1 1562**] and because the patient wished to be closer to home, it was determined that her care would be continued back at [**Location (un) 28985**].
