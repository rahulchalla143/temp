LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 22.5 with 85% neutrophils, 9% bands, 5% lymphocytes, hematocrit 37.3, platelets 308, PT/PTT of 15 and 25.5, INR of 1.5.
Urinalysis was negative except for specific gravity of 1014, large blood, greater than 50 red blood cells, 0 to 2 white blood cells, a few bacteria, 0 to 2 epithelials.
Chemistry with sodium of 133, potassium 4.1, chloride 96, bicarbonate 24, BUN 32, creatinine 2.4 (baseline creatinine is about 1.5), and glucose 153.
LDH 154, ALT 14, AST 15, alkaline phosphatase 52, calcium 8.6, magnesium 2.7, phosphorous 1.2, lactate was 4.3.
Blood cultures are pending.
Urine cultures pending.
CT abdomen with basilar atelectasis, tract pleural effusions bilaterally, diffuse thickening of the large bowel beginning in the rectum incorporating the sigmoid as ascending, transverse, and descending colon, appendix was dilated to 9 mm with wall thickening, small amount of mesenteric inflammation in the cecal area, pancolonic wall thickening has increased since prior study.
Started on intravenous Levophed to help support blood pressure.
Pressures and blood pressure remained stable.
Patient was empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics under sepsis protocol, and these were eventually weaned down as her C. difficile toxin returned positive and patient was just continued on p.o.
Clostridium difficile colitis:  Patient with diffuse pancolitis on the CT consistent with positive stool studies.
The Gastroenterology team was aware and following patient but had no plans for a colonoscopy at this time.
The patient had a chest x-ray which was unchanged from previous one with no evidence of failure, just bilateral atelectasis at the bases.
Acute and chronic renal failure:  Patient's baseline creatinines ran 1.5 to 1.8 and after hydration under sepsis protocol, patient's creatinine returned to baseline and otherwise remained stable.
At time of discharge her INR was 2.5.
Patient will have her INR checked as an outpatient by VNA two days after discharge and then can follow up with her primary care physician in seven to 10 days to have her INR rechecked.
As her blood pressure started to elevate here and was otherwise stable and her acute renal failure resolved back to her baseline, patient was restarted on her Cozaar at low doses which can be titrated up as needed.
Her diuretics were still held with concern for hydrational status at present.
Patient is to follow up with her primary care physician in seven to 10 days to have her INR checked.
