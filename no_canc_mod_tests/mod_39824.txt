Urine ([**1-23**]) - negative Blood ([**1-23**]) - NGTD x 2 sets  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]yoF with h/o dementia and depression who presents w/ hypotension, fevers, and altered mental status.
Her BP improved quickly w/small IVF bolus in the ED.
She was diuresed with lasix with 5L of urine output and her respiratory status and hypertension improved.
Although she was not on anti-hypertensives prior to her admission, she has symmetric LVH on her echocardiogram, suggesting that she has had chronically elevated blood pressures.
Her TSH was normal and an echocardiogram demonstrated preserved EF with 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1914**] left atrium.
# EKG changes w/elevation in troponins - likely due to demand ischemia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypotension and fever Pulmonary edema Atrial fibrillation Delerium Dementia   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, breathing comfortably, saturations are 95% on room air.
