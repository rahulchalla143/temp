An echo was done to work up his syncopal episode which showed severe (4+) mitral regurgitation and evidence of posterior chordae tendinae rupture.
His procedure was deferred and he was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac evaluation.
The patient was referred for an echo at that time, but there is no note in the system and his family cannot recall him having this study done.
They do state that if he had had the echo done, it would have been here.
On arrival to the emergency department, the patient's vitals were 98.3 98 125/80 16 99% 4L.
His EKG was NSR with a right axis deviation and signs of RVH.
When his blood was drawn for routine labs, the patient became nauseated and again syncopized, his heart rate subsequently decreasing into the 40s and then leading to 9 seconds of asystole, during which is SBP dipped into the 80s.
Chest compressions were undertaken for 30 seconds and there was ROSC, after which he was electively intubated and sedated.
A STAT echo revealed severe MR, flail posterior leaflet/chordae, LAE, severe pulmonary HTN, mild pericardial effusion, RV hypokinesis, and an LVEF of 75-80%.
A chest X-ray showed marked cardiomegaly and congested pulmonary vasculature.
Left heart cath revealed clean coronaries.
Right heart cath showed RA 20's, RV 70's, LVEDP 20's, PA SBP: 30's.
His cardiac index was 1.7 and an intra-aortic balloon pump was subsequently placed for cardiogenic shock.
The patient was transferred to the CCU where his vitals were 37.4 74 (SR) 105/49 96% on PSV 5/5 at 13/minute.
His ventilator settings were changed to AC TV 500ml, PEEP 5 at 22 breaths/minute to correct for his hypercarbia, which was felt to be related to low tidal volumes and frequency and for his hypoxemia, thought to be related to V/Q mismatch/shunt (pulmonary congestion) and alveolar hypoventilation (low TV) given the elevated A-a gradient (217; nl for age = 15.3).
His repeat ABG on the new settings was 7.39/47/86/30, the mild improvement in O2 suggesting shunt physiology and his PEEP was increased from 5 to 8.
He held his blood pressure well and his first cardiac index in the unit had increased to 2.6 with an SVR of 829. .

Balloon pump (1:1) to which he responded well; post-IABP CI was 2.6.
We felt his mitral regurg was likely chronic given the progression of his EKG changes since [**2105**] (increasing RVH, new RAD), his elevated PA pressures without florid pulmonary edema, and the gradual worsening of his symptoms, which were previously attributed to sinusitis alone.
Echo showed myxomatous mitral valve.
He had a temp max of 100.6 which we thought could be a pneumonitis from intubation causing gastric contents to irritate his lungs and cause a fever.
CXR showed no PNA but we treated him for possible aspiration pneumonia because he was at high aspiration risk because he was intubated.
Neurology was consulted, head CT and MRI unremarkable.
He was febrile consistently in the first few days post-op and sputum culture was positive for PANTOEA SPECIES.
