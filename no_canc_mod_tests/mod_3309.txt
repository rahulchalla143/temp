In the ED, VS were BP 108/72 HR 115 O2sat 95%RA.
She was also found to be in ARF with a Cr of 1.4 (b/l 0.8) and received 2L of NS.
In addition a Bedside ECHO done (given low voltage on EKG, ?
In addition, her BP remained low 70-80s and thus decision made to transfer to CCU for closer monitoring and inotropic support with dobutamine.
Extremities were cool on examination prior to transfer to CCU.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Transmitral Doppler imaging is consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: 60 year old female with a hx of DM2, HTN, and CVA who presents with dyspnea x3 days, AFib, and new dilated CM with EF 15-20%.
A bedside ECHO was performed for concern of pericaditis, as the patient had low voltage on her EKG and there was some concern that she may have had a pericardial effusion.
The study revealed acute, decomponsated CHF, with a dilated cardiomyopathy and an EF of 15%, compared to a baseline EF of 56% on [**5-14**].
In the CCU, the patient was started on dobutamine gtt with goal SBP > 100.
Dig was subsequently added for further rate control.
Of note, the patient's ECHO did not show evidence of amyloid and her iron studies and TSH were all normal, with the exception of an elevated ferritin.
Viral studies have been negative: HIV, CMV, EBV (Igm neg).
Urine sample contaminated with epithelial cells.
Repeat UA was negative and cipro was stopped.
# Transaminitis: Pt had elevated LFTs on admission with ALT and AST that peaked at 1100 and 1900.
