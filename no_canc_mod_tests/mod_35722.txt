[**2143-10-31**]: Chest Xray - Findings consistent with mild CHF .
[**2143-10-31**]: EKG Sinus tachycardia, RV conduction delay Lateral ST-T changes are nonspecific Since previous tracing of [**2143-9-4**], rate is increased   Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 45 year old woman with poorly controlled hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who presented with shortness of breath found to be in hypertensive urgency.
Her blood pressure was initially controlled with iv medications.
Her prior evaluation for causes of secondary hypertension did not reveal evidence consistent with either endocrine or renovascular causes.
During her [**2143-1-30**] evaluation she had an isolated aldosterone level of 37, however, 3 days later the an aldosterone and renin levels were measured (7 and 9.2, respectively) and were not consistent with a primary hyperaldosterone state.
Prior imaging of her adrenals by MRI revealed normal size and signal to the glands.
Repeat aldosterone and renin levels were drawn to confirm the prior findings.
These labs were pending at time of discharge.
Her blood pressure was ultimately stabilized on combination of minoxidil and lisinopril with volume control by ultra-filtration at hemodialysis.
Baseline HCT 23-30.
Low Serum Bicarbonate with AG of 18: This was thoughtly ikely due to renal failure/uremia.
Elevated CK, Trop: The patient presented with hypertensive urgency and had a small elevation in her troponins and CK consistent with demand ischemia in setting of hypertension and pulmonary edema.
An EKG revealed no acute ischemic changes.
Risperdal Consta 25 mg/2 mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) mL Intramuscular  every 2 weeks.
blood pressure controlled on oral medications.
Managing your blood pressure properly is an essential goal to maintain your health and to prevent bad events such as strokes and heart attacks.
