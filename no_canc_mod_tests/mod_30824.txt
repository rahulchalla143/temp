She was transferred to MICU for further stabilization, and did well subsequently with minimal intervention - fluid restriction and small amount of hypertonic saline, which was discontinued.
<BR> On evaluation of her back, an MR of the L-Spine revealed acute compression fracture of L1 vertebra with retropulsion and 50% narrowing of central portion of the spinal canal, moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5 level due to disc and facet degenerative changes.

ECHO Study Date of [**2187-8-4**] 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Volume was allowed to reequilibrate, and the patient's sodium improved with fluid restriction and a small amount of hypertonic saline.
Compression fracture: An MRI showed a compression fracture of the L1 vertebra with retropulsion and 50% narrowing of central portion of the spinal canal, moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5 level due to disc and facet degenerative changes.
Her ECHO reveals a   EF55% 2+TR, 2+MR, RV depressed, Pulm Regurg, mod PA HTN.
We stopped her fentanyl patch (25mcg) as it caused the patient to become confused.
At your rehabilitation facility: Please have sodium level checked on [**2187-8-13**], then weekly thereafter.
