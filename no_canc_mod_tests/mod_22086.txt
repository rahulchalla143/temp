Transesophageal echocardiogram  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 42 year old male with past medical history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, hypercholesterolemia, and asthma who was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2104-11-9**] for evaluation and management of acute stroke.
On arrival there, he was noted to be afebrile, with BP 120/70, HR 79.
On exam there, he reportedly had a left visual field cut and ataxia.
He was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Examination showed left homonymous hemianopsia, paresthesias of left face, arm and leg and left arm and leg ataxia.
NIH stroke scale score was 5.
MRI showed area of restricted diffusion in right PCA.
MRA showed decreased flow in the right PCA beyond P1.
Per his report, hypercoaguability work-up was negative.
Sensation: Intact light touch bilaterally, but light touch on left side of face, arm and leg resulted in tingling.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     1 1 1  1  1 Left      1 1 1  1  1  Grasp reflex absent.
Coordination: Ataxia with left sided finger nose finger.

Correlative plain head CT would help to provide further differentiation.
MRA demonstrates improved but still limited perfusion in the right posterior cerebral artery.
MRI of the brain shows no change in the extent of right posterior cerebral arterial infarction, compared to the earlier study of this day.
----- CT head w/o contrast [**2104-11-10**]: There is loss of the grey/white matter differentiation involving the right PCA territory.
----- Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2104-11-10**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
----- Transesophageal Echocardiogram [**2104-11-12**]: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
A head MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion in the right posterior cerebral artery territory consistent with acute ischemic infarct and MRA demonstrated abrupt cut-off of the proximal right posterior cerebral artery.
Post-tPA MRI/MRA demonstrated improved perfusion in the right posterior cerebral artery.
On [**2104-11-10**], surface echocardiogram showed mild mitral regurgitation but no definite cardiac source of embolism.
On [**2104-11-12**], transesophageal echocardiogram showed no cardiac source of embolism, trace mitral regurgitation, and normal biventricular function (LVEF >55%).
Arrangements were made for MRI head in 1 month coincident with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the primary team arranged for the patient to have an outpatient hypercoagulation workup.
You should get an MRI the same day.
Repeat MRI in one month here at [**Hospital1 18**] as above.
Hypercoagulable laboratory work-up will be repeated as an outpatient.
