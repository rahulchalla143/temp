In the cath lab, her blood pressure improved to 110 systolic with IV fluid.
Coronary angiography initially showed no CAD.
Given the location of her chest pain and its radiation, an aortogram was performed; it showed no evidence of dissection.
A right heart cath showed near-equalization of right and left heart filling pressures at 25mm, and cardiac echo showed more than moderate circxumferential pericardial effusion with a dilated RV and no evidence of tamponade.
Repeat RH pressures showed RA 15, PCW 22, [**MD Number(3) 78228**] 70's.
Review of systems could not be obtained, but per discussions with the cardiology fellow, she noted only chest pain, cough, and pain with deep inspirations.
Past Medical History: Bilateral hip replacements (seen on cath)   Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: VS: T97.7F, BP 124/60, HR 77, RR 14, O2 100% on vent settings AC, rate 14, volume 500, FiO2 100%, PEEP 5.0 Gen: WDWN elderly female in NAD, intubated and sedated.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
1+ DP pulses bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation at 120bpm with diffuse ST elevations most notable inferolaterally.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2130-5-25**] demonstrated: Referred from ED with mid chest to back pain with slight diffuse ST elevations most prominent inferolaterally.
SBP was in 70's.
Coronary angiography initially showed no CAD.
SBP improved to 110 with IVF.
Cardiac echo then done showing no more than moderate circumferential pericarfdial effusion with dilated RV and no evidence of tamponade.
REpeat RH pressures showed RA 15, PCW 22, [**MD Number(3) 78228**] 70's.
Amio started for maintenance of NSR with BP appearing related to conversion from AF.

A cardiac catheterization showed no coronary flow-limiting lesions.
Given her hypotension was responsive to volume, with an underfilled LV and slightly larger RV on cardiac catheterization, patient was evaluated for pulmonary embolus with CT angiogram, which did not show evidence of PE.
# Pump: Echocardiogram showed normal function.
The patient and her son/HCP expressed understanding of this and requested the medications be discontinued.
# Pulmonary nodules: The patient had pulmonary nodules, the largest measuring 3 mm, noted on CT of her chest completed to rule out a pulmonary embolus.
She will need follow up of these nodules at 3 months with a repeat CT scan for further evaluation if she should choose so as an outpatient.
A CT head was done which showed no evidence of intracranial bleed.
An MRI was initially ordered but discontinued after goals of care were addressed.
Given the patient and her family's desire to hold all medications, the patient was given no further medications.
Her medications were discontinued and the patient was discharged  - as per her and her son's wishes.
The patient is asymptomatic and her vital signs are stable.
You underwent cardiac catherization to evaluate your chest pain, and briefly required intubation (breathing tube) to help with your breathing.
Your blood pressure and breathing stabalized.
Treatment options and goals of care were discussed, and you and your family decided to no pursue any further testing or medical treatment.
If desired, please complete a repeat CT of your chest in 3 months.
