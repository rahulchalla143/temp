He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] the following day for further evaluation of hypotension and decreased urine output.
Chest x-ray and CT angiogram at the time were negative.
MRI of the head was performed which showed an old cerebellar infarction and micro-angiopathic changes, but no acute infarction.
Lumbar puncture was performed which was negative.
CT scan of the chest without contrast was done initially because of the patient's acute renal failure and it showed only small bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient had been anti-coagulated with Lovenox at the outside hospital because of his atrial fibrillation, however CT angiogram was performed again to rule out pulmonary embolism.
Prior to the CT angiogram being done, the patient experienced a significant episode of hematemesis for which the heparin drip was stopped.
CT angiogram was eventually done which showed a left anterior segmental pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral lower extremity non-invasive studies were done which were negative for deep vein thrombosis and the patient was restarted on the heparin drip.
Later that evening, on [**2142-5-3**], the patient became acutely hypoxic with O2 saturations in the 70s; his skin was mottled.
He was noted to be in atrial flutter at a rate of 150 with a blood pressure initially of 180/90.
The arterial blood gases at that time showed pH of 7.26, pCO2 of 40 and a pO2 of 51.
His temperature at that time was noted to be 102.0 F.  Subsequently, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s which responded to aggressive volume resuscitation.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was done to evaluate for right ventricular thrombus, and revealed dilatation of the right ventricle and mild global hypokinesis but no intramural thrombus.
As the patient's blood pressure improved on intravenous fluids, lysis of his pulmonary embolism and likely recurrent massive pulmonary embolus was deferred.
In the setting of this acute stress, the patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 3.2.
Nasogastric lavage was performed which was negative.
The patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit improved to 31.2 from a nadir of 28.0.
Following extubation, the patient was total body overloaded from his aggressive volume resuscitation, approximately 13 liters for length of stay and was diuresed aggressively between one and two liters per day, which he tolerated well.
Heparin drip with a goal PTT of 60 to 65 because of the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   At the time of admission, the patient was afebrile at 98.8 F., heart rate was 76; blood pressure 136/66; respiratory rate 20 and he was saturating 100% on a face tent at 15 liters per minute.
Examination of his neck revealed no jugular venous distention.
His heart examination was regular without murmur, although Telemetry revealed a rhythm of atrial flutter.
His lung examination at the time revealed diffuse expiratory wheezing.
His abdominal examination was benign.
Extremity examination revealed two plus peripheral edema throughout.
LABORATORY:  At the time of transfer, white blood cell count was 6.9, hematocrit 29.7, platelets 214.
PTT was 84.3.
His respiratory status improved dramatically over 24 to 48 hours and was weaned to room air with saturations of 93 to 94%, while ambulating.
EKG was checked at one of these occasions which was unchanged from the previous and the pain was only fleeting with no elevations of cardiac enzymes.
A thorough work-up was done including lumbar puncture as listed above and various viral serologies at the recommendation of the Infectious Disease consultation.
Because the patient is from [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 **] area, numerous etiologies were thought plausible and the patient was ruled out for both influenzae both A and B, CMV, Lyme Disease, EBV, both IgG and IgM were checked with the IgG positive, Histoplasma and Ehrlichia and RSV, all of which were negative.
Blood cultures and urine culture were all negative as well.
No antibiotics were given after the day of admission after the lumbar puncture was done and was found to be negative.
NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  This was felt to be due secondary to demand in the setting of atrial flutter in the rate of 150s and massive pulmonary embolism.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient did not have either esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy this admission because of the ongoing need for anti-coagulation as well as his high O2 requirements earlier on in the hospital course.
The patient will follow-up with Electrophysiology in approximately one month for follow-up EKG and possible intervention at that time.
It is possible that with treatment and resolution of his pulmonary embolism, the patient may convert back to sinus rhythm on his own, which is why no acute intervention was done.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], for INR checks, upon returning to [**Location (un) **].
Following that blood transfusion, the patient's hematocrit remained stable between 33 and 35, requiring no further blood transfusions.
His electrolytes were managed and repleted on a p.r.n.
q. day to be adjusted based on INR at primary care physician's discretion.
