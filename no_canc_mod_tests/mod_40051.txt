Admission Date:  [**2148-10-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-10-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-8-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Cipro / Quinolones / Cephalosporins / Gammagard Liquid  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2090**] Chief Complaint: Weakness and hallucinations  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation [**10-15**] Pheresis catheter placed [**10-15**] Plasmapheresis D1=[**10-16**], D2=[**10-18**] D3=[**10-21**] D4=[**10-23**] D5=[**10-25**] Extubation [**10-26**]  History of Present Illness: 73y F with longstanding history of [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] who presents with hallucinations, confusion, slurred speech, and generalized fatigue.
Apparently, her outpatient Neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63296**], advised them to have her brought to either [**Hospital1 112**] or [**Hospital1 18**] for Neurologic evaluation and care.
She has been breathing comfortably and her vitals have been rather unremarkable at the OSH and here.
Her labs in both hospitals are notable for intracellular dehydration with what appears to be a "contraction alkalosis" (hypernatremic, hypokalemic, hyperHCO3/~alkalotic), and for possible UTI (dirty UA).
From what I can gather from the above sources, she has long-standing MG s/p thymectomy in [**2124**], and last immunosuppresion Tx was [**2143**]-[**2145**] with CellCept.
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **], as above; s/p thymectomy [**2124**]; antibody status unknown; Neurologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10653**]; intubated in ICU [**2143**]; last on immunosuppression [**2143**]-[**2145**] (CellCept); back on Mestinon past 6mos, decreased [**1-24**] nausea, then recent up-titration [**1-24**] increased fatigue.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, and non-distended, + normoactive bowel sounds.
2+ radial, DP pulses bilaterally.
Inattentive, tangential; cannot perform MOYbw (gets 0 or 1 in order, then goes forward).
Memory - registers 3 objects and recalls [**1-25**] at 5 minutes.
V: Facial sensation intact and subjectively symmetric to light touch V1-V2-V3.
Eyes-closed Finger-to-nose testing revealed mild proprioceptive deficit on the left UE.
-Reflex exam (left; right): Pec/delt (+++;+++) Biceps (++;++) Triceps  (++;++) Brachioradialis (++;++) Quadriceps / patellar (++;++) Gastroc-soleus / achilles (+;+) Plantar response was withdrawal/?flexor bilaterally.
-Coordination exam: Finger-nose-finger testing with no gross dysmetria.

Baseline FVC 1.47 in [**2140**].
She saw her o/p neurologist and he decreased this to 15mg qid (had not been on since [**2145**]) due to conerns for overmedication.
CXR was clear at OSH and due to hallucinations, she had a CT head which was normal.
Patient passed swallow assessment and was started on a soft diet and CXR showed a left base opacity concerning for possible pneumonia although given clinical stability and that she had no stigmata of infection, was afebrile, additional antibiotics were held.
Immediately post intubation CXR showed R>L base opacities and in the setting of a fever to 101.1 she was started on IV meropenem and vancomycin for HAP.
The patient remained clinically stable, did not appear septic and had no further fevers and given that all cultures were negative, antibiotics were discontinued on [**10-17**].
UA was positive but UCx was negative and no treatment was instituted.
Patient had transient hypotensive episodes with her plasmapheresis which improved with IV fluid boluses and latterly the decision was made to hold her metoprolol before plasmapheresis days which improved this.
She was aslo noted to have hypercalcemia to 11.4 and PTH was normal.
She remained stable without any complications from intubation and had an uneventful last plasmapheresis session on [**10-25**].
Vitals were stable and NIF was -24 FVC was 0.9L and was transferred to the stepdown unit on [**10-28**].
We rechecked a CT Chest to look for thymoma which shows no infiltrates but the final read is pending.
We rechecked a UA and urine culture prior to discharge with the result thus far showing a contaminated sample not consistent with a UTI.
TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: [ ] Mycophenolate - Please increase mycophenolate to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] after 5 more days on the 500mg [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
[ ] Please f/u the CT Chest and UA/Urine Culture.
[ ] Please follow her fingerstick glucose and start an insulin sliding scale if needed.
Mestinon (pyridostigmine) 15mg --> 30mg --> 45mg PO q4hrs (doses increased once each over the past two days; only one dose of 45mg was given today in OSH ED by family; pt had been cutting her pills into 1/4s, so the aforementioned doses to her are approximate -- equivalent to one, two, or three of her cut-up pieces of pill).
