Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-9-25**], a left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now identified.
[**2195-11-25**]: Chest xray: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
[**2195-11-30**] Foot XR - There appears to have been resection of the distal first metatarsal and base of the first proximal phalanx.
PATHOLOGY: [**2195-11-25**] 1.
Bone, left first metatarsal head (B-C): -  Trabecular bone with marrow fibrosis, acute osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis.
His blood sugar improved from 30's to 300's and the octreotide drip and D10 drip were stopped.
After his multiple podiatric procedures were performed, his oral hypoglycemics were restarted and his blood sugars remained stable between 80-200.
They were then both restarted once his many procedures were completed, and his heart rate remained between 60-80s.
In the intensive care unit, his systolic blood pressure rose to almost 200, requiring treatment with hydralazine.
Lasix was used as needed for volume overload and his lisinopril was restarted with improved blood pressure control.
He was restarted on both his metformin and glipizide 24 hours prior to discharge, and his blood sugars remained stable between 80-200.
He is chronically anticoagulated with coumadin, and was admitted with an inr of 9.3.
This was restarted on [**2195-11-30**], and his INR was 2 on discharge.
Chronic diastolic heart failure: He was treated with intermittent diuresis for volume overload.
Discharge Condition: Stable vital signs   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low blood sugar and low heart rates thought due to a medication interaction with an antibiotic and your usual medications.
