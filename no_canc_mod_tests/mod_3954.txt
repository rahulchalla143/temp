CT Head [**3-24**]: Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, stable in appearance and extent  since the previous study.
CTA/CTP [**3-25**]: 1.
CT head demonstrates interval coiling with coil artifact in the region of anterior communicating artery.
CT perfusion of the head demonstrates increased mean transit time and decreased blood volume in the left anterior cerebral artery territory indicative of acute infarct.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates occlusion of the A2 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery.
CXR [**2101-3-29**] In comparison with the study of [**3-28**], the monitoring and support devices remain in place.
CTA [**2101-3-29**] 1.
CTA [**2101-3-31**] 1.
CXR [**2101-4-2**] The lungs are hyperinflated.
Her blood pressure was kept from 120-140, and she was placed on nimodipene for vasospasm prophylaxis.
Her blood pressure was kept below 140.
Her CTA showed no evidence of vasospasm and patient was transferred to step down.
A PT eval was also requested.
On [**4-2**] a u/a was obtained but results were questionable, therefore we awaited a culture before starting antibiotics.
A CXR was also obtained which revealed worsensing of opacities/effusions.
Pts exam remained stable.
On [**4-3**] the urine culture was positive.
A repeat U/A was obtained for confirmation.
Pt's exam stable.
