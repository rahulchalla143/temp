She also uncerwent head CT and C-spine CT for her fall which were negative except for old C2 fracture and cervical stenosis/DJD.
Because of the unequal pupils her head CT was repeated which again did not show ICH or mass effect.
In the ED, initial VS were: Pulse: 150, RR: 24, BP: 142/75, Rhythm: Atrial Fibrillation, O2Sat: 89, O2Flow: 100 fio2.
Her initial ABG was 7.32/51/72/27.
Cardiology performed a limited bedside echo which showed small RV with good contractility, no suggestion of PE per report from ED.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. HR150 BP 120/102.
Shortly after admission her BP dropped to systolic in 60s with HR persistently 150s.
EKG showed ventricular rate of 150, rhythm appeared either sinus tach or flutter with 2:1 conduction.
She was given 6mg IV adenosine which slowed the vent rate and demonstrated flutter waves.
Her blood pressure repsoned well and slowly her HR decreased to 90-100s.

EKG [**3-26**] Probable atrial flutter with 2:1 block.
[**2193-3-27**] TTE ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of CAD, but preserved global systolic function.
Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets.
A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**3-26**] Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.
CXR [**3-28**] New right transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery (best seen on the digitally augmented view).
[**4-5**] CT TORSO CT CHEST: 64-row MDCT was performed from the thoracic inlet to the base of the lung following administration of 150 mL of intravenous contrast.
Evaluation of the right lateral subcutaneous soft tissues is precluded secondary to streak artifact from the patient's side abutting the CT gantry.
However, attention to this area on subsequent imaging studies is recommended to ensure that an abscess is not forming.
CT PELVIS: 64-row MDCT was performed from the iliac crest to the symphysis pubis following administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
[**2193-4-11**] EEG - IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to a slow and disorganized background rhythm and due to bursts of bifrontal slowing.
[**2193-4-14**] CT TORSO - IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2193-4-22**]: FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
CXR [**2193-4-23**]: IMPRESSION; In order to differentiate recent widening of left upper mediastinum due to engorged mediastinal vessels which appears reasonable as reflected by interval worsening mild pulmonary edema vs acute aortic pathology, erect view is recommended for further evaluation.
CXR [**2193-4-24**]: IMPRESSION: Views of the torso centered at the diaphragm and in the left upper abdominal quadrant show a nasogastric feeding tube, absent.
ECG's: Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2193-4-24**]  12:07:58 PM Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2193-4-22**] the rate has increased.

Her blood cultures grew two bottles of coagulase negative staphylococcus though her sputum cultures did not grow any pathogenic organisms.
CXR showed diffuse bilateral alveolar reticular opacities and had ARDS by large A-a gradient and PaO2/Fio2  ~72.
Her bronchoscopy showed DAH though vasculitis labs were negative.
Multiple attempts were made over 2 weeks to wean her from the vent, which were unsuccesful.
Repeat bronchoscopy was performed [**4-13**] and demonstrated blood-tinged sputum, suggestive of recurrent or ongoing DAH.
She was started on digoxin for rate control though her rate persisted in the low 100s.
A TEE was performed which did not show any clot and she was started on heparin and succesfully cardioverted.
Heparin was stopped when her INR was therapeutic.
GPC Bacteremia: [**1-12**] initial blood cultures grew coagulase negative staph.
Her cultures were sensitive to vancomycin.
Surveillance cultures remained negative.
She underwent a TTE and a TEE which did not show any vegetations.
Later her central line and arterial line were removed and cultures of the catheter tips were negative.
She received 3 day course, but urine culture returned negative .
Only positive micro dat  was initial blood culture from [**2193-3-26**] showing coagulase negative staph.
Vanco/Zosyn course completed [**4-4**]; she did appear to improve on ABX but not entirely afebrile, but fever curve worsening.
CT torso performed on [**4-5**] was unrevealing of any infectious source.
Sputum gram stain was notable for yeast and GPCs.
Fungal cultures were unremarkable.
Urine culture was negative, but patient did complete a 3 day course of ceftriaxone.
On presentation to the OSH the nature of her fall was unclear so she underwent CT head and c-spine.
Her CT head did not show any changes though her C-Spine film did show an old C2 fracture.
After treatment with albuterol and ipratropium at the OSH she was noted to have an enlarged L pupil so a repeat head CT was performed which again did not show any acute changes.
QTc was monitored daily while patient was on antipsychotics.
