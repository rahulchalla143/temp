Blood cx on [**12-3**] grew pansensative E. coli with no clear source as UA was clear, CXR revealed no infiltrate and line site looked clean.
Antibiotics were weaned to Unasyn alone given only e. coli grew in the blood cultures and follow-up cultures have been negative with bandemia and fever resolved.
CT abd/pelvis to r/o abdominal process as source of GNR bacteremia was obtained which revealed ?
Repeat imaging then demonstrated ?transverse and left sided colitis could not be excluded, thus colitis may represent his source of blood seeding.
78 year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation recently in a nursing home because of a T12 compression fracture, presenting from his nursing home with lethargy and weakness, decreased appetite for several days with temperature to 101. .
The patient's temperature was 103 rectally in the emergency department.
Laboratories were significant for lactate 2.7, 17% bandemia.
The patient was given three liters normal saline with improvement in systolic blood pressures to 100s.
Blood and urine cultures were sent and he patient was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidine.
Head CT which showed a "hyperdense convexity along the right frontal lobe measuring 3 mm thick which most likely represents a small acute subdural hemorrhage."
On arrival to MICU, patient was normotensive to 124/75 with heart rate 60.
2/2 blood culture bottles from admission grew gram-negative rods.
Urinalysis and urine culture were negative.
Chest X-ray was negative for infection.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the patient had elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT and showed no acute abdnormalities.
Physical Exam: VITALS:  Temp 96.5, HR 60, BP 128/64, RR 14, O2 sat 98% on RA, CVP 9-10.

Head CT: 1.
Follow up head CT is recommended to document interval change in [**6-9**] hours, or sooner if the patient's mental status changes.
[**2112-12-26**] CT Abd: COMPARISON:  Abdominal CT dated [**2112-12-11**].
FINDINGS:  The evaluation of abdominal organs and major vessels are limited due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Evaluation of these lesions is limited.
The evaluation of small and large bowel is limited without oral contrast.
PELVIS:  Large amount of ascites new since prior studies is noted, measuring approximately [**5-11**] [**Doctor Last Name **].
The wall of the ascending colon is somewhat prominent which may be edematous, however, the evaluation is limited due to lack of oral contrast and surrounding fluid.
Clinical correlation and close monitoring of the hematocrit level is recommended.
Limited study without intravenous contrast or oral contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Interval posterior thoracolumbar fixation from T10-L2 with compression fracture of T12 with subcutaneous small fluid.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the distal rectum.
The patient's temperature was 103 rectally in the emergency department.
Laboratories were significant for lactate 2.7, 17% bandemia.
The patient was given three liters normal saline with improvement in systolic blood pressures to 120s on arrival to the MICU.
Blood and urine cultures were sent and he patient was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidine.
The patient was initially given decadron as he had been recently on prednisone; this was discontinued as cortisol stimulation test showed an appropriate response.
2/2 blood culture bottles from admission grew gram-negative rods.
Urinalysis and urine culture were negative.
Chest X-ray was negative for infection.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the patient had elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT and showed no acute abdnormalities.
Records were obtained from [**Hospital1 336**] that demonstrate that the patient was evaluated by neurosurgery who did not feel the patient was a surgical candidate.
Neurosurgery continued to followup patient and the followup L-spine film showed post-operative changes.
# GI bleed: The patient had GI bleeding [**12-9**] which was felt likely secondary to cecal AVM seen on [**Hospital1 336**] colonoscopy [**11-7**].
The patient's hematocrit should be checked later this week ([**2112-1-6**]) to ensure that it is stable.
On discharge the patient had baseline hematocrit ranging from 26-30. .
# Liver cysts/ascites: HIs abdominal CT during his stay showed persistent and stable liver hypodensities consistent w/ liver cysts or hamartoma.
His hepatitis B titer suggest that he likely was exposed in the past but developed antibody to it.
In addition, a CT scan on [**12-26**] demonstrated new accumulation of ascites, which similarly should be evaluated by liver specialist.
He should have his thyroid levels rechecked in two weeks time ([**2113-1-18**]) to assess whether his synthroid dose needs to be decreased.
His platelet count on discharge was 80K.
His exposure to heparin with PIV and PICC flushes should be minimized and his platelet count should be checked serially (next check [**2113-1-5**]).
# Head CT. Pt had head CT which showed a "hyperdense convexity along the right frontal lobe measuring 3 mm thick which most likely represents a small acute subdural hemorrhage."
The patient's neurologic exam remained nonfocal throughoout hospitalization.
Repeat CT head showed the same findings; stable.
