She was brought to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], where she was noted to have jerking of her right arm and right leg only and a subsequent episode in which all extremities were jerking.
A head CT revealed a right frontoparietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, a right occipital EDH, left parietal EDH, and SDH (subdural hemorrhage), substitute epidural hemorrhage for EDH.
Hematocrit of 25.
Vitals were otherwise stable.
On her prior admission, Neurology had been consulted for new onset seizures and her workup including MRI and LP had been negative.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 101.6, blood pressure 138/50, heart rate 107, respiratory rate 16, and O2 saturation 100% on room air.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Does withdraw to painful stimuli in extremities.
Withdraws to painful stimuli in all extremities except minimally in the left upper extremity.
LABORATORIES:  White count 6.1, hematocrit 25.6, platelets 180.
PT 14.2, PTT 27.7, INR of 1.3.
Sodium of 132, potassium 4.8, chloride 97, CO2 25, BUN 20, creatinine 0.9, glucose of 175.
Head CT showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontoparietal region, left vertex.
Urinalysis was negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hospital course was significant for the following issues:  The patient was initially admitted to the Trauma SICU, where she underwent close monitoring overnight of the 17th.
Patient's mental status was thought to be deteriorating, and a stat head CT was repeated.
Patient was transfused 2 packs of red blood cells and blood pressure medications were titrated to achieve a goal systolic blood pressure of 130.
Hematocrits q.4.
She was given blood to maintain a hematocrit greater than 28 and G-CSF was used to keep her ANC greater than 1000.
She was also given platelets to maintain her platelets greater than 100 given the cranial bleeds.
Patient was started on labetalol for blood pressure control.
According to Neurology, the cause of the intracranial hematomas and subarachnoid blood is most likely a consequence of dysfunctional platelets while head trauma particularly the true contrecoup distribution as possible, it seems somewhat unlikely in the absence of a clear history of head trauma and the lack of superficial stigmata on examination or imaging study.
A GI consult was obtained and favored holding off on EGD unless she had further life threatening GI bleeding.
Her stools at that time were brown and her hematocrit was stable.
She had a MRI/MRA on [**2167-5-6**], which was somewhat limited due to the patient's movement, but demonstrated minimal resolution of the right posterior epidural hemorrhage and stable subdural and epidural hemorrhages and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A Neurology service continued to follow the patient and recommended a follow-up MRI in [**5-19**] weeks.
For the next week her hematocrit remained stable from 29 to 33 range.
Patient's hematocrit remained stable as noted.
Her white blood cell count was low and she was maintained on Neupogen as needed to maintain an ANC greater than 1000.
Cultures taken during this time revealed a urine culture with greater than 100,000 E. coli, and a urine culture on [**5-5**] with yeast.
She had one positive blood culture, which was thought to be a contaminant, coag-negative Staph one bottle of six on [**5-5**].
Other blood cultures were negative.
She also had negative urine cultures on the 24th.
Hypertension:  The patient was transitioned to Lopressor and captopril, and these medications were titrated up to maintain a blood pressure in the 130 to less than 140 range.
A repeat swallowing study recommended maintaining the current diet consistency of puree and thin liquids and maintaining aspiration precautions, eating well while sitting bolt upright, and controlled bolus size.
