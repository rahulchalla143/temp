Workup in the past has included TTE (EF 55-60%, moderate-severe AI, severe posteriorly-directed MR, and severe pulmonary HTN), Chest CT (c/w interstitial lung disease).
Patient now transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - Severe mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hyptertension (no reports available) 3.

ECHO [**10-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**10-15**]:  FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low.
EKG not consistent with ischemic origin; no signs to suggest infection on history, imaging, labs; does not appear to be acute worsening of MR, but more slow progression.
Ground glass appearance on chest CT and bilat pleural effusions may be suggestive of interstitial lung disease and may be somewhat responsible for DOE.
Cardiac surgery saw pt today and recommeneded further testing via cardiac catheterization and TEE to better evaluate valve.
INR 1.6 on discharge, 5 mg dose was continued.
PCP will arrange [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u in [**Hospital3 **] for INR monitoring.
Cardiac surgery will arrange cardiac catheterization and TEE as an outpt in preparation for MVR.
The cardiology surgery team will contact you at home to schedule the two tests, cardiac catheterization and echocardiogram via the esophagus.
The cardiac surgery department will call you at home to schedule a cardiac catheterization and esophageal echocardiogram in the near future.
