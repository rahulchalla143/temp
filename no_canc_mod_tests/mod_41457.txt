HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old male, with a history of extensive CAD status post multiple interventions, CHF with an EF of 20%, status post ICD placement, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, who presented with pneumonia and non-ST elevation MI at [**Hospital3 **], diagnosed on transfer from [**12-29**], and transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for catheterization.
At approximately 5:00 pm on [**12-29**], he had an episode of hypertension, SBP in the 200s, a heart rate of 140s with shortness of breath and satting 80% on [**2-4**] liters of oxygen, treated with Nitropaste, 10 mg IV metoprolol, lasix 40 IV, and morphine with improvement.
Relook cath on [**2126-5-6**] - 80% proximal LAD, 80% D1 lesion, 60% ramus, 100% OM2.
EF of 22% on MIBI in [**2126-3-2**] with a history of CHF.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5-2.4.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 98.3, blood pressure 134/58, heart rate 64, respiratory rate 24, satting 95% on 3 liters.
PERTINENT LABORATORY AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  Creatinine 2.6, potassium 3.7, white blood cell count 5.0, hematocrit 37.2, PTT 79.3, INR 1.13.
Initial CK 1103 in the AM of 27, MB 102, index 10.5, troponin greater than 50.
HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient's enzymes continued to be trended, and they continued to trend down from the outside admission labs.
The patient was delayed catheterization until his creatinine decreased, given the risks of nephrotoxicity, and on [**2126-1-5**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed disease in his mid-LAD, and he received a PTCA to the mid-LAD.
The patient got 20 of IV lasix with little effect, and started on an Natrecor drip with lasix 40 IV, and diuresed approximately 1,900 cc to a PAD of 23.
Creatinine continued to improve from 2.6-2.0.
Given his ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 20%, [**State 531**] Heart Association III baseline, improving, the patient was diuresed to a dry weight of 208 pounds.
2) ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  The patient had an ultrasound at the outside hospital which was negative for a postobstructive process.
The patient's creatinine continued to trend down with further diuresis and improvement of renovascular flow, to a discharge creatinine of 2.1.
However, while being maintained on Natrecor, his creatinine bumped again to 2.3 up to 2.5, which was likely thought to be due to overaggressive diuresis, and we decreased his lasix dose at that time.
Strep culture was sent which was negative.
Stable heart rate and blood pressure.
