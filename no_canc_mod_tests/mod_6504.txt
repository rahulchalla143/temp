* In the ER, he was found to have BP 157/83 HR 73 RR18 O2Sat 99%.
Exam was significant for inattention to left side, righ gaze deviation, right eye skew deviation, vertical upgaze palsy, left hemiparesis, left hemisensory loss.
CT Scan showed 4cm x 3cm right basal ganglia/thalamic bleed with extension to right lateral ventricle with mass effect and slight midline shift.
His INR was found to be 2.7.
He was started on a labetalol drip to keep MAP less than 100.

His exam is significant for left sided inattention, upgaze palsy, bilateral sixth nerve palsy, skew deviation of right eye, left hemiplegia, and left hemisensory loss.
BPs remained fairly well controlled on drip, but he had episodes of agitation where BP was increased to 190's.
- Repeat head CTs on [**10-29**] and [**10-30**] showed stable appearance of the bleed.
- The patient's exam remained unchanged during his hospitalization.
- Coumadin was d/c'ed, and the patient's goal INR was 1-1.5 throughout his hospital stay.
Given the risk of bleed, it was felt that his goal INR should be 2.5-3.
Pulm: - The pt had a low grade temp on [**10-30**] and CXR was obtained to r/o PNA.
CXR was normal, but left lung base was not adequately visualized.
A PA and lateral showed no infiltrate.
Sats were good and pt did not have T spike.
F/E/N: - Diabetic, cardiac diet - Pt coughed during neuro exam with thin liquids.
Please start anticoagulation with coumadin on Sunday night, and check INR again at least by Wednesday morning.
Goal INR should be 2.5-3.0 in the setting of the patient's resolving intracranial hemorrhage.
INR needs to be monitored very carefully in this patient.
As goal SBP is less than 140 in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage, this patient will need careful BP monitoring and titration of blood pressure medications.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: - Right thalamic intracranial hemorrhage with intraventricular extension - HTN - DM - MVR ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 1525**])  Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the ER if you have any further weakness or sensory loss, any difficulty breathing, or any difficulty seeing, speaking, or swallowing.
