He was initially sent to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital, but he was transferred over here with an Amylase of 2660, total bilirubin of 11, with a direct bilirubin of 7.7.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed two stones at the common bile duct at 11 mm.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature was 98.8?????
?, blood pressure 143/77, heart rate 113, respirations 35, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
Abdomen: Nondistended but tender to palpation diffusely, especially at the midepigastric and right upper quadrant area.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count 7.1, hematocrit 42.5, platelet count 114,000; sodium 137, potassium 4.3, chloride 99, bicarb 22, BUN 32, creatinine 1.9, glucose 115; neutrophils 37, lymphocytes 8, monocytes, 9, 6 bands; ALT 129, AST 77, alkaline phosphatase 191, total bilirubin 6.7, amylase 858, lipase 937.
Chest x-ray was with poor inspiratory effort with left hemidiaphragm, elevated and large amount of dilated loops of bowel with gas.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed a common bile duct of 7.3 mm, thickened gallbladder walls, no fluid, two stones in the gallbladder, non-obstructing, with an echogenic liver.
He had an ERCP done in which a large stone was found impacted in the distal common bile duct.
Because of his ileus, and orogastric tube was inserted; however, the patient had denied a nasogastric tube because of previous deviated septum.
He continued to have somewhat elevated amylase and lipase but overall had a general decline.
On discharge, his amylase and lipase were still elevated.
On [**8-14**], the patient's white blood count increased from the mid teens to 19.
His hematocrit was in the low 30s, so a CT was performed.
The CT did not show any evidence of bleeding.
The abdominal fluid did not grow any bacteria.
Past cultures returned back negative, and the antibiotics were discontinued.
It came back as 25, so a gastric lavage was performed which was negative.
Repeat hematocrit was 29.6.
Repeat CT was again performed which showed similar subphrenic fluid collection with bilateral pleural effusions.
A repeat CT was done because of increased pain after the aspiration of his subphrenic collection.
The CT was done to rule out any source of bleed.
His amylase and lipase are still somewhat elevated.
His ALT and AST are within normal limits; however, his alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase remained somewhat elevated.
However, not much fluid was taken off based on repeat chest x-rays.
After the thoracentesis procedure, he had some right-sided chest pain and right flank pain.
An ABG was done which showed respiratory alkalosis.
Chest x-ray did not show any pneumothorax.
He was eventually switched to nasal cannula, and now he is on room air with oxygen saturations of 94%.
Chest x-rays after the procedure did not reveal any pneumothorax.
Repeat chest x-ray did show some right lower lobe and possibly right middle lobe atelectasis.
He had an echocardiogram done which showed an ejection fraction of 40%, and within the echocardiogram, he had no gross evidence of abdominal cardiac function.
Renal:  The patient had an elevated creatinine after the ERCP which increased to 2.9; however, with hydration, the patient's creatinine had decreased gradually.
On admission his creatinine had been 1.9.
He was transfused with 1 U of red blood cells once the hematocrit had been recorded as 25, and he responded to the 1 U.
