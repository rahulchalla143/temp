A right PICC tip is in the proximal SVC.
CXR [**6-3**] and on chest CT on [**6-6**] revealed right upper and lower lobe consolidation c/w  pneumonia.
Chest CT [**6-7**] showed RUL/RLL pna which grew MRSA in the sputum and BAL, s/p levo/clinda/vanc, [**Date range (1) 109654**].
During the time the pt received an extensive work-up including multiple cultures, CT of the abdomen, chest, and sinuses, MRI, tte and tee, multiple lumbar punctures on the floor, and a tagged WBCC scan, all of which failed to localize a source.
On [**6-19**], a repeat cxr noted RUL cavitary lesion and patient underwent CT scan for further evaluation.
CT revealed evolving approx 1cm x 1cm cavitary lesion of RUL lobe w/ resolving surrounding cavitation.
It was recommended that the patient have a follow-up CT scan in [**2-27**] weeks, and patient to be scheduled for CT Scan at the [**Hospital1 **] on [**2182-7-29**] and then have follow-up appointments with Infectious Disease doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**].
Coumadin started [**6-24**] with goal INR [**12-27**] (need to adjust warfarin accordingly).
After 3 days of Heparin, patient was switched to Lovenox, which should be continued for 1-2 days after INR is therapeutic.
INR was therapeutic at 2.0 on day of discharge ([**2182-7-3**]), and patient should be continued on Lovenox 80 sc bid for 4 more doses.
INR should be checked every 3-4 days and adjust Coumadin dose accordingly.
His depakote levels were followed q4 and he was given activated charcoal q4.
Once his levels were within a therapeutic range, his AC was d/c'd.
As the pt's valproic acid levels trended down, the pt was attempted to be weaned from sedation.
Initial non-con CT head was negative.
EEG in MICU showed mild encephalopathy with no focal epileptiform activity.
ENT was consulted and a VTI maxillofacial CT was performed as preop evaluation.
Repeat CT revealing some resolution of ethmoid sinus opacities and alternative fever source negated plans for possible operative intervention.
