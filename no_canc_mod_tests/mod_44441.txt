He presents with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus growing in his blood cultures and urine.
Last blood culture positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was [**10-28**]; all others have remained negative.
Films of the 19th show negative osteomyelitis of the hips.
Lumbar puncture was done and was negative for the source of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A Transesophageal echocardiogram was performed on [**10-31**] which showed no endocarditis.
Clostridium difficile cultures were sent and were negative.
Temperature was 98.1; blood pressure 90 to 108 over 38 to 50; heart rate 61 to 73; respiratory rate 18; saturating 97% on three liters of oxygen.
Cardiovascular: Distant heart sounds with S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer to medicine, white count was 21.0.
All blood cultures had remained negative since [**10-28**] which was positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Several studies were performed to further evaluate cause of the Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and his leukocytosis, initially presenting with a white blood cell count of 21.
The patient was maintained on Vancomycin levels, dosed when blood levels were less than 15.
A bone scan was performed which demonstrated increased uptake in the left proximal femur and acetabulum, consistent with osseous repair following fracture and surgical repair and infected component could not be excluded from the proximal left femur based on the bone scan findings.
They suggest a six week course of Vancomycin with a follow-up bone scan at that time to further evaluate the surgical repair versus hardware seeding of this patient's Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
A magnetic resonance scan was performed which demonstrated a left psoas muscle abscess, measuring two by three by 2 cm.
CT also demonstrated diffusely atrophic pancreas with multiple small cystic structures, measuring several mm in the head of the pancreas.
Follow-up evaluation is recommended.
The left psoas muscle abscess was further evaluated on CT and determined to be a possible psoas hematoma.
Initially, a temporary line was placed until the patient was cleared of infection and white count had returned to [**Location 1867**].
They also suggested further cognitive testing as an outpatient at the skilled nursing facility.
The patient had a noticeable pressure ulcer over his coccyx, for which he was treated with appropriate wound care.
Anemia:  The patient was followed and maintained on a hematocrit above 30.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will monitor his INR for a goal of two to three while transitioning to Wolfram.
The patient will need to have Vancomycin levels dosed when they are less than 15.
The patient will receive one gram of Vancomycin when levels are less than 15.
The patient has a follow-up CAT scan scheduled on [**12-19**] as well as a bone scan scheduled on [**12-19**].
Hydralazine 25 mg three tablets q. eight hours, hold if systolic blood pressure is less than 100.
Wolfram 5 mg q h.s., may be adjusted when therapeutic INR between 2 and 3.
