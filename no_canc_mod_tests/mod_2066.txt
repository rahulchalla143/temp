MRCP [**2105-6-7**]: 1.
WBC was 15.3 with 89.9% PMNs.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn which eventually grew E. coli sensitive to ceftriaxone but resistant to TMP/SMX (which the patient had taken at home).
An renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis, masses, calculi, or abscess.
On hospital day 1, patient's oxygen saturations dropped to the high 80s%, she was ~13L positive, and CXR showed fluid overload.

MRCP showed no evidence of biliary obstruction.
Her ALT was initially 130 and her AST was 113 and these trended down during her stay.
