Again, he had this same episode with diaphoresis, chills, rigors, tachypnea, and a fever to 104 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday.
He had a negative KUB, and blood cultures that were drawn.
The patient's vital signs other than fever were stable except for a desaturation to the low 80s during his rigorous episodes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed his temperature was 98.4, his blood pressure was 134/80, his pulse was 92, his respiratory rate was 24, and he was saturating 99 percent on 3 liters.
General physical examination revealed he was anxious appearing and appropriate for age.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Cardiovascular examination revealed distant heart sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.
Mini- Mental Status Examination was greater than 28.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES FROM THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  The lumbar puncture under fluoroscopy showed no organisms.
Gram stain, there was 1 white blood cell, 7 red blood cells, clear, with a pending culture.
Blood cultures from the outside hospital showed gram-negatives growing in anaerobic bottles [**1-13**].
RADIOLOGY:  As stated before, a head computer tomography and KUB - per outside hospital - were also negative.
A chest x-ray showed no acute process.
White blood cell count was 3.1, his hematocrit was 44, and his platelets were 100.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 8.
Sodium was 140, potassium was 3.4, chloride was 108, bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen was 7, creatinine was 0.5, and his blood glucose was 128.
His troponin was less than 0.02.
His albumin was 3.6.
His INR was 1.5.
The patient was initially worked up because of the rales found on his physical examination as well as some signs suggestive of either congestive heart failure or pneumonia found on chest x- ray.
As the only imaging not done at the outside hospital - including his abdomen and with a history of uric acid stones and questionable picture of urosepsis, the patient received a computer tomography of the abdomen which showed a left portal vein septic thrombus.
The patient had to be put on 10 liters of nonrebreather to keep his oxygen saturations above 90 percent.
After the left portal vein septic thrombus was found on the computed tomography scan, the patient was immediately moved to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further observation.
Blood cultures were again drawn, and the patient was changed to ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Discussion,  per the surgeons with the Interventional radiologists - all agreed that the thrombus was stable at present (as confirmed by a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging) that no surgical intervention was necessary for removal of this clot.
Because of the correlation with chest x-ray it was later assumed to be congestive heart failure either from diastolic dysfunction from his tachycardia or an underlying congestive heart failure picture; that was also given to using gentamicin, Flagyl, and ampicillin.
The patient's white blood cell count had normalized, and the patient did not have any rigorous episodes his initial presentation.
The patient was also to meet with a hematologist - Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6160**] - in five weeks for a workup of hypercoagulable state; as normally an underlying hypercoagulable state is necessary before a left portal vein thrombus is produced.
Computer tomography findings were also suggestive of a resolving diverticulitis that may have led to this left portal vein thrombus.
The patient stated he had recently had a colonoscopy which showed a diverticulosis and was unaware of what the correct diet for a patient with diverticulosis should be.
Blood cultures from the outside hospital confirmed anaerobic bottles grew out Prevotella melaninogenica and Bacteroides fragilis, but no blood cultures or urine cultures from in house have grown any organisms.
Because of being started on Lovenox and Coumadin, the patient was to have his INR checked in three days at his [**Hospital 6642**] Hospital.
The patient did not show any laboratory values of an obstructive bile pathology as his bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase were normal throughout his admission.
A Clostridium difficile toxin times two were negative before discharge, and the patient did not have any diarrhea on the day of discharge.
The patient also understood that he was to have his INR and liver function tests checked and have a computer tomography of the abdomen in the future.
The patient also understood to see the hematologist regarding when to discontinue his Coumadin and when to not be anticoagulated any longer as well as for a workup of hypercoagulability.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Prescription to have blood draw for prothrombin time and INR on [**6-10**] and [**6-13**] and to have the results faxed or called to the patient's primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) 6643**] is Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6644**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (fax number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6645**]).
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6644**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - (fax number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6646**]).
The patient was instructed to have his blood drawn at the [**Hospital 469**] Clinic - [**Location (un) 448**] laboratory - at least three days prior to his [**7-14**] appointment with the hematologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6160**].
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed to follow up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6160**] - the hematologist - in five weeks, on [**7-14**] at 10:00 a.m. on the ninth floor of the [**Hospital 469**] Clinic.
The patient to have his blood drawn for C protein, S protein, lupus anticoagulant, homocystine, factor V Leiden at least three days prior to his appointment; for which a prescription was given.
The patient was scheduled for an outpatient computed tomography scan of the abdomen which is scheduled for [**2194-7-10**].
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6644**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - regarding his admission to the [**Hospital1 69**].
The patient was to have his Discharge Summary faxed to his primary care physician regarding this admission and regarding followup on INR and liver function tests.
