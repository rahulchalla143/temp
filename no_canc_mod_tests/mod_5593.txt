Of note, a while ago he did purchase a heart monitor and noted that his resting heart rate was in the 80s and 90s persistently.
An outpatient workup over the last few months has included a chest x-ray, which showed interstitial markings and hilar fullness.
A CT, which showed bronchial wall and septal line thickening, increased pulmonary vasculature, ground glass opacification and bilateral pleural effusions read as consistent with congestive heart failure versus sarcoid.
On the day of admission he presented for an outpatient echocardiogram, however, during the examination when he was in the left decubitus position he developed acute onset of shortness of breath and was noted to have diffuse rales.
His blood pressure at that time was noted to be in the 260s.
After treatment he had resolution of his symptoms, but his blood pressure continued to be high and on admission to the floor he had a blood pressure of 190 to 110.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies headache, flushing, diaphoresis, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary complaints, fevers or chills.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.2.
Blood pressure 200/120.
Heart rate 109.
Respirations 20.
Lungs crackles at the left base, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Funduscopic examination no papilledema.
Electrocardiogram sinus tachycardia, normal axis and intervals.
Chest x-ray with mild reticular interstitial pattern.
Echocardiogram ejection fraction less then 20%, moderately dilated left atrium, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, moderately dilated left ventricle, decreased right ventricular systolic function, 1 to 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 1007**] blood cell count 11.9, 86% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, hematocrit 44.4, platelets 360, INR 1.1, sodium 139, potassium 3.4, BUN 20, creatinine 1.3, glucose 120.
CK 191, CKMB 4, troponin less then .3.
His urinalysis was without blood or proteinuria.
A Nipride drip was also added later for better blood pressure control.
His blood pressure improved on these medications and he was eventually able to be weaned off of his nitroglycerin and Nipride drips.
A beta blocker was deferred due to his workup for hypertension, which included urine studies for metanephrines and VMA, aldosterone level, renal ultrasound and renal angiography.
His aldosterone level was within normal limits.
His renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities.
Renal angiography, which was performed during his cardiac catheterization (see below) showed 40% renal artery stenosis on the right and 50% renal artery stenosis on the left.
His initial urine studies from a 24 hour collection showed urine metanephrines of 162 with a normal range of 26 to 230, no metanephrines 864 with normal range of 44 to 540 and VMA of 11.8 with normal range between 2 and 10.
The elevation of his normetanephrine levels raised the concern for pheochromocytoma, but her the endocrine team it was difficult to interpret these findings given that catecholamines can be falsely elevated in the acute hospital setting.
They recommended that he not be started on a beta blocker until his pheochromocytoma workup was complete due to the fact that the beta blocker would interfere with test results.
A cardiac catheterization was performed to rule out ischemic cardiomyopathy.
His left heart catheterization revealed high diagonal with proximal 90% stenosis, twin left anterior descending coronary artery system, ramus with mild luminal irregularities, right coronary artery with luminal irregularities and 40% lesion in the RPL.
A right heart catheterization was also performed with right atrial pressure of 5, pulmonary artery pressure 27/14, pulmonary wedge pressure of 12, cardiac output 4.6, cardiac index 4.5, SVR 1235, PA saturation of 70%.
Left ventriculography showed an ejection fraction of 10%.
His creatinine remained mildly elevated, but stable throughout his hospitalization.
