This sinus EKG was noted to be no different from the prior ones.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI [**2159**], PTCA [**2155**] HTN PAF Hyperlipidemia L cataract surgery Type II DM Hx of meningioma  Social History: 1ppd x 40 years, Denies EtOH or IV drug use  Family History: +Type II DM, HTN  Physical Exam: VS: Afebrile, BP 133/55 HR 65 RR 14 O2sat 100% 4L GEN: Laying in bed, sleeping HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, neck supple, unable to visualize JVD from obesity Lungs CTA bilaterally, no rales COR: RRR S1, S2, II/VI SEM at LSB ABD: soft, NABS, NTND, no rebound Extrem: + femoral pulses bilaterally, no bruits.
No significant changes compared to the EKG from [**4-26**] except for J-point elevation in III.
Cath ([**11-8**]): chronic occlusions of RCA + LCx with collaterals.
LMCA 30%, 50% LAD, 40% Ramus.
elevated LVEDP with LVEF 45%, +MR, infero basal akinesis, inferior hypokinesis.
EP ([**11-8**]): Showed 2 foci of inducible VT which pt became hypotensive requiring 200 J shock -> sinus rhythm.
Echo: EF 45% E;A ratio 1.50  The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
There was a main focus of VT with the same morphology as the VT shown on EKG at OSH.
Several hours later, pt had an episode of sustained VT lasting 1-2 min and subsequently had chest pain and became hypotensive to the SBP 50's.
CXR showed no acute pulmonary processs.
2)CAD: Pt underwent cath prior to the EP study which showed chronic occlusions of RCA + LCx with collaterals.
Elevated LVEDP with LVEF 45%, +MR, infero basal akinesis, inferior hypokinesis.
3)Pump: EF 45%, pt was continued on lisinopril 40 mg po qd, and metoprolol 50 mg po tid.
Femoral artery ultrasound was done which showed ###################.
5)DM: Glipizide was held initially for cath but was later re-stasrted.
