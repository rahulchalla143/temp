LP there showed 365 wbc, 1 rbc, prot 105, glu 58.
CBC and Chem-8 were wnl.
SHe is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and management.
Head, neck, cardiac, lung, abdominal, and extremity exam were within normal limits.
Pertinent Results: WBC-11.1* Hgb-14.0 Hct-37.4 Plt Ct-231  PT-13.0 PTT-34.7 INR(PT)-1.1 Na-140 K-3.7 Cl-108 HCO3-24 BUN-7 Creat-0.7 Gluc-117* Ca-8.9 Phos-2.8 Mg-2.0 ALT-13 AST-15 AlkPhos-64 TotBili-0.4  OSH: LP with 365 wbc, 1 rbc, prot 105, glu 58.
MRI prelim reports stating "right parietal infarct vs. inflammatory disease, increased diffusion signal on L side, ?
MRI with multiple T2 and diffusion abnormalities, LP with lymphocytosis.
Neuro (meningoencephalitis, seizures, venous sinus thrombosis): Given the concern for viral meningoencephalitis, pt was treated empirically with acyclovir pending HSV PCR results from CSF.
Dilantin levels were low, and she was reloaded with dilantin.
Once therapeutic levels were reached, these paroxysmal episodes ceased.
When she began to have seizures again, since they were in a new location (right-sided as opposed to left), a repeat head MRI was obtained which showed bilateral tubular areas of susceptibility effect and T1 hyperintensity with surrounding leptomeningeal enhancement.
Two of the regions in the right post-central gyrus and in the left frontal lobe are associated with underlying white matter edema suggesting vasogenic edema associated with elevated venous pressure/venous infarcts, although there is no restricted diffusion.
Compared with the MRI from the OSH, there was enlargement of the existing lesions, no new lesions and resolution of the DWI abnormalities.
Cortical veins showed no evidence of thrombosis.
Etiology was likely due to a combination of factors, including being 3 months post-partum, on birth control pills prior to admission and the viral meningoencephalitis.
She was started on coumadin, and was maintained first on heparin and then on lovenox until INR was therapeutic.
Hypercoaguability workup was performed and all tests were negative.
Fever: When repeat MRI showed enlargement of lesions, it was unclear if this represented the natural progression of the disease vs actual disease worsening.
They recommended repeat LP, which showed 79 WBC (99% lymphocytes) 19 RBC.
Pt had no localizing signs or symptoms of an infection, multiple cultures of blood and urine were negative.
Transaminitis: Liver enzymes were checked as part of workup for fever, and both AST and ALT were mildly elevated.
Hepatitis serologies were negative, except for Hep B surface antibody positive, consistent with hep B vaccination.
Hyponatremia: After starting trileptal, her sodium level decreased to 130 where it stabilized.
Leukopenia: While in the hospital, her WBC count decreased to a low of 2.1.
Your INR will be followed by the anti-coagulation group at Dr. [**Name (NI) 58294**] office.
Please go to her office this Monday [**9-19**] to have your blood drawn and INR checked.
