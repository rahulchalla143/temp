Ruled out for MI with negative troponins, echo showed inferolateral akinesis.
Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization, which showed proximal LCx angulated high grade lesion and distal OM branch tight lesion: LMCA - non-obstructed LAD - 80% mid-vessel ISR in the distal aspect of the stent LCx - 90% ostial stenosis and there is a 90% stenosis in the upper pole of the OMB PCA - known occluded, not engaged SVG-OM - known occluded, not engaged RIMA-RCA - subselectively negaged and non-obstructed  In the cath lab, the OM lesion was wired and then ballooned open using 2.0mm balloon to 4 ATM.
Echo performed in cath lab showed no pericardial effusion.
Plan is for overnight monitoring in the CCU with plan to return to cath lab in [**1-27**] days for PCI to ostial LCX +/- PCI to prox LAD (and relook at OM).
CARDIAC HISTORY: - CABG: [**2149**] (RIMA- RCA, SVG- OM) - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: --> [**2154**] Stenting of PLV branch distal to RIMA touchdown --> [**2155**] Stenting of the prox/mid LAD w/ rescue of a jailed D1 branch --> [**2160**] Stenting of distal RCA after the anastamosis of a RIMA graft --> [**2163**] Stenting of origin LCX - PACING/ICD: None 3.

PULSES: Right: DP 2+ Left: DP 2+  Discharge exam: Unchanged, except for as below Extremities: minimal bruising at right radial artery access site, no hematoma or bleeding  Pertinent Results: Labs: [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD WBC-2.6* RBC-3.66*# Hgb-12.2*# Hct-35.1* MCV-96 MCH-33.2* MCHC-34.7 RDW-14.3 Plt Ct-80* [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD Glucose-149* UreaN-14 Creat-0.8 Na-141 K-3.8 Cl-105 HCO3-29 AnGap-11 [**2165-12-24**] 10:45PM BLOOD CK-MB-2 [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD CK-MB-3 [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.5 Mg-2.0  Procedures: -Cardiac cath ([**2165-12-24**]) -  COMMENTS: 1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated native three-vessel coronary artery disease, with progressive coronary disease in two native vessels.
This initially appeared suspicious for perforation, but echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion, and patient remained hemodynamically stable.
4) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 154/76 mmHg.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 y/o M with PMHx significant for CAD, DM, HTN, PVD, prostate CA, and pancytopenia, who was admitted to OSH with unstable angina and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
Now, s/p PTCA of OM and ostial LCx lesions, complicated by concern for coronary dissection vs. performation, admitted to the CCU for monitoring.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  #CAD/PUMP - Pt was transferred from an OSH for cardiac cath because of chest pain with a positive stress test, CK-MB at [**Hospital1 18**] were noted to be negative.
The cardiac cath showed native triple vessel disease with stenoses in the LAD and LCx.
Immediate bedside echo did not show evidence of a pericardial effusion.
Formal transthoracic echo the next day also did not show evidence of pericardial effusion.
Hct remained stable during admission.
#Prostate CA - In remission per pt report.
#H/o kidney stones - Continued home allopurinol  #Dyslipidemia - By report, he is unable to tolerate statins in the past, none were started this admission.
#Transitional issues -Metoprolol was decreased from 50mg to 25mg daily, will need this reevaluated as an outpatient -Amlodipine increased to 10mg this admission, will need BP followed-up as an outpatient -Will likely need repeat cath for PCI as no stents were placed during cath this admission -Should continue to have pancytopenia followed-up as an outpatient  Medications on Admission: Aspirin 81 mg dialy Metformin 500 mg qHS Metoprolol 50 mg daily Imdur 60 mh qAM Norvasc 5 mg qPM Allopurinol 300 mg qAM Vesicare 10 mg qPM Amitiza 24 mcg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
You had a positive stress test which showed some poor blood flow in part of your heart.
You had a cardiac cath on [**12-24**] which showed disease in all 3 of your coronary arteries.
The following changes were made to your medications: CHANGE metoprolol succinate to 25mg daily CHANGE aspirin to 325mg daily CHANGE amlodipine to 10mg daily  Followup Instructions: Name: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 275**] C.
