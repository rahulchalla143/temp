A TTE done at that time showed an EF of 10% with akinetic motion of the anteroseptal wall and markedly hypokinetic motion of inferior wall of the LV.
Discussion was had with outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and patient finally agreed to ICD and catheterization so direct admission was planned.
Patient remained minimally responsive and ABG showed 7.21/79/207/33.
He was placed on O2 with sats in the low 90s.
Repeat FSBS was 150s without change in mental status and ICU transfer was initiated.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] is a 77yo M with history of insulin dependent DM, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 10% and COPD who was electively admitted for cardiac catheterization and ICD placement.
His arterial blood gas on the floor showed hypercarbia to 79 (pH 7.21) with improvement to 61 (pH 7.3) overnight in the ICU.
His acetazolamide was discontinued prior to discharge as his serum bicarb was 32 on day of discharge.
OSA was diagnosed clinically during this admission based on exam and continuous oxygen monitoring.
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy/CAD: Initially patient was directly admitted for ICD placement and cardiac catheterization.
Recent EF 10% with some bilateral lower extremity edema on exam on admission.
After patient became more stable and euvolemic, cardiac catheterization was attempted but patient became unresponsive on arrival to cath lab and it was cancelled.
However with ESBL UTI, discussed below, further evaluation for device placement was deferred.
Patient will continue medical management of his systolic CHF and CAD with aspirin, beta blocker, statin, diuretics and [**Last Name (un) **] (currently being held until BP and renal function have proved stable).
His weight on discharge was 94 kg and his SpO2 was 94% on room air at rest.
Patient's electrolytes will need close monitoring and repletion as needed.
# ESBL E. coli UTI: On presentation urine culture appeared consistent with colonization with ESBL.
Repeat culture during the admission in the setting of unresponsiveness and new leukocytosis showed active infection with E. coli with ESBL.
FSBS was 45 on arrival to the hospital.
His hypoglycemia responded to D50 and discontinuation of long acting insulin.
Blood sugars were consistently between 150 and 250 during the rest of his admission and his glargine was titrated up to 20 units on the day of discharge.
Would recommend restarting his Diovan after discharge if his blood pressure and renal function tolerate.
His creatinine was 1.6 on day of discharge.
Because of his daily periods of apnea, poor cardiac function, active UTI, compromised renal function, progressive dementia, and resistance to invasive procedures the decision was made to transition him to DNR/DNI.
The family is aware of his poor prognosis and why invasive procedures including cardiac catheterization and ICD placement could not be safely pursued during this admission.

Your Diovan was HELD throughout admission and should continue to be HELD until your blood pressure and renal function improve.
