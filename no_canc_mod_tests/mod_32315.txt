These findings suggest a widespread encephalopathy, and the faster frequencies and low voltage raise the possibility of medication as a cause of that encephalopathy.
[**2116-10-7**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: No evidence for acute intracranial abnormality.
[**2116-10-9**] MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 1.
[**2116-10-10**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 1.
Initial toxicology screens were only positive for EtOH.
Imaging studies of the head were negative except for extensive soft-tissue swelling.
Repeat head CT did not reveal any changes.
Subsequent EEG showed widespread encephalopathy and MRI did not show any acute changes.
On repeat head CT  there was a slight increase in right frontal soft-tissue swelling.
