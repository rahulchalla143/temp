She was found to have an initial transaminitis of AST 1700 and ALT 1614 with T.bili 3.3 (direct 2.7).
During her 24 hrs at [**Location (un) 8641**], she progressively worsened such that prior to transfer, her AST was 5495, and ALT 5039 with T.bili of 3.4.
Her INR was 2.4 prior to transfer.
Her creatinine was also elevated initailly at 2.1 but improved to 1.5 prior to transfer.
At the OSH, her CT abdomen showed moderate fatty infiltration of the liver, and abdominal US showed s/p cholecystectomy, but no biliary dilation.
A CT head was also negative.
Patient with NGT - she has had sips but otherwise not eating.
Past Medical History: 1) Depression 2) s/p Appendectomy 3) s/p cholecytstectomy 4) s/p D&C 5) Acute bronchitis -> PNA in [**12/2104**] 6) Chronic R-sided chest pain with ?

======== Portable CXR [**2105-2-16**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Very low lung volumes exaggerate heart size which is probably normal, and produce or reflect atelectatic crowding at the lung bases.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is diffusely echogenic.
She continued to receive NAC until INR dropped below 1.5.
LFTs, bilirubin, INR have trended down steadily.
INR has now normalized, while LFTs, bilirubin are approaching normal.
Believed secondary to ATN (muddy brown casts, FeNa of 0.3) which is a known complication of acetominophen toxicity.
Creatinine peaked at 3.3 and then trended down slowly to (presumed) baseline of 0.7-0.8 by the time of discharge.
The potassium wasting was suspected to be secondary to a renal tubular defect (though patient was not acidotic at that time), given levels in the urine > 50 mEq/L when serum values would indicate that < 5 mEq/L would be expected.
She was started on amiloride at 2.5 mg daily and increased to 5 mg daily, which reduced the urinary potassium wasting and helped to stabilize serum K values at ~4.
She will be continued on this medication at discharge with a plan to follow up with the nephrology team for further outpatient management.
Finally, magnesium levels were noted to drop several days after the K wasting began.
Amiloride was stopped on [**2105-2-28**] and potassium levels remained stable in the normal range.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO 1X/WEEK (FR) for 4 weeks.
You were noted to pass large amounts of electrolytes in your urine, which was felt also to be related to the kidney injury by the acetominophen.
Your electrolytes were closely monitored and you received appropriate supplementation.
