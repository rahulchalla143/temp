HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post CABG x2, aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve replacement on Coumadin with recent prosthetic valve thrombosis, status post TPA thrombolysis, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20% with 2+ mitral regurgitation, and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and history of ventricular fibrillation arrest requiring pacemaker and ICD placement, now presents from rehabilitation with acute renal failure and hypertension requiring pressors.
The patient was doing well initially at rehabilitation, however, several days postdischarge, was noted to have progressively increasing BUN and creatinine (creatinine 3.4, BUN 106), and hyponatremia with confusion.
The patient subsequently became hypotensive and was brought to an outside hospital Emergency Department, where she received normal saline boluses, and was started on dopamine secondary to systolic blood pressures in the 60s.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department, where a chest x-ray revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates consistent with worsened heart failure.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with hemodynamic instability.
The patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization on [**2104-2-9**] for acute graft closure with PTCA and stenting of the LIMA to the left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the diag.
Congestive heart failure with biventricular failure, ejection fraction less than 20% with severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.5, heart rate 80, respiratory rate 26, oxygen saturation is 89-94%, FIO2 of 40%.
Neck examination supple with no jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy.
Abdominal examination is distended with normoactive bowel sounds, soft, no rebound or guarding.
Minimal serous drainage and pressure ulcers on bilateral heels.
LABORATORIES AND STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  Complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 22.8, hematocrit 31.6, 24 on repeat, and platelets of 203.
White blood cell differential with 93% polys, 3.3% lymphocytes, 3.2% monocytes, and no eosinophils.
Chem-7 with a sodium of 127, potassium 4.6, chloride 87, bicarb 23, BUN 115, and creatinine of 3.0 with a glucose of 180.
Coags with a PT of 17.4, INR 2.0, and PTT of 28.2.
LFTs with a total bilirubin of 1.3, ALT 140, AST 70, alkaline phosphatase 857, amylase 103, calcium 9.3, phosphate 6.3, and magnesium 2.7.
In addition, urinalysis with large blood, trace leukocyte esterase, greater than 50 red blood cells, 21-50 white cells, many bacteria, no yeast, and [**3-19**] squamous cells (chronic Foley).
Chest x-ray with diffuse patchy infiltrates, no pneumothorax and right IJ and PICC line in place.
Portable abdominal x-ray with no dilated loops of bowel.
Arterial blood gas on assist control tidal volume 500, PEEP of 5, respiratory rate 18, FIO2 of 100% with a pH of 7.28, pCO2 62, and pO2 of 52.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on [**4-21**] for hemodynamic monitoring with evidence of increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, decreased vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output consistent with concomitant sepsis and heart failure.
Multiple blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures were obtained without growth throughout the hospitalization.
The patient's hematocrit dropped as low as 24 requiring multiple blood transfusions, however, the patient was felt too unstable to undergo colonoscopy.
On [**4-23**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate and hemodynamic compromise.
The Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, as well as Infectious Disease Services were consulted for further input.
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan was obtained with evidence of new large rectus sheath hematoma with bladder compression.
After approximately 45 minutes of ACLS, the patient developed sinus rhythm with a systolic blood pressure in the 150s on dopamine, amiodarone, as well as Morphine.
CPR was again performed with multiple shocks, Epinephrine, and atropine.
