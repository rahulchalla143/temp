She was originally taken to an OSH, but then transferred her after head CT showed the IPH.
She was transferred to the floor on [**6-27**], and her head bleeds have been stable clinically and radiographically.
TTE showed moderate to severe TR and pulmonary HTN, and she is scheduled for a cath on Monday for further workup.

CT HEAD [**6-26**] AM 1.
CTA HEAD [**6-26**] Overall stable appearance of R temporal hematoma with slight increased edema but stable mild left shift.
MRI HEAD W and W/O [**6-26**] IMPRESSION: Right-sided temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage identified with extension to the subarachnoid space and subdural space.
Post-gadolinium images are limited for evaluation of any enhancement in the area.
It is recommended that if clinically indicated the post-gadolinium imaging should be repeated if necessary with sedation.
CT Head [**2120-6-27**]: Stable appearance of bleed and midline shift.
Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 over L5.
CTA chest w/ w/o contrast [**2120-6-28**]: No segmental, subsegmental pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndromes.
ECHO [**2120-6-28**]: IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
The patient reports headaches were common for her but the recent headaches were much more severe.
She initially presented to an OSH where a noncontrast CT scan of the head was obtained which showed a right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, a Right subdural hematoma, and a small Right subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Following the results of the imaging she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
In order to attempt to determine the etiology of her IPH in conjunction with recommendations from neurology, a CTA of the head and MRI with and without contrast of the head were obtained.
The CTA showed that there was a stable appearance of her intracranial blood and that there were no aneurysms appreciated.
Her MRI showed stable appearance of her bleed and no underlying mass but motion artifact resulted in non-ideal study.
Patient was started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and levels were appropriate after adjustment with albumin.
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed tricuspid and atrial regurgitation as well as severe pulmonary hypertension ([**2120-6-27**]).
After the Echo final read was done, Cardiology was [**Month/Day/Year 4221**] on [**2120-6-28**] and recommended a CTA to rule a PE.
The CTA was performed which did not show a PE.
A right-sided cardiac catherization was performed, which showed normal biventricular filling pressures, normal cardiac output, and normal systemic blood pressure.
No further studies were recommended by the Cardiology service.
