Her blood pressure was noted by EMS to be over 200 systolic and they thought they saw some jerking of her right arm.
On head CT, she did have a right thalamic hemorrhage with extension into the lateral ventricles as well as the third and fourth ventricles.
Her daughter and her son-in-law live in [**State 2748**].
PHYSICAL EXAM UPON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 99.8, blood pressure was 238/45.
Her heart rate was 119 and regular.
Her respiratory rate was 19, and her O2 saturation was 100% prior to intubation on room air.
Her HEENT exam revealed moist mucous membranes with clear oropharynx.
LABORATORIES UPON ADMISSION:  White count was 13.6, hematocrit was 35, and platelets were 286.
Her coag studies were normal.
Her Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 145, glucose of 238, and bicarb of 30, otherwise was unremarkable.
Cardiac enzymes were negative upon admission.
One was placed with not much CSF draining and there appeared on the CAT scan to be ample room for any potential hydrocephalus to be a problem.
This [**Name2 (NI) 19843**] was D/C'd on [**3-3**], and CSF cultures withdrawn from the [**Month (only) 19843**] prior to removal were negative for any infection.
We also explained, however, that because she had a premorbid dementia, that recovery might be less significant, that it might be otherwise suspected.
An EEG done during the movement revealed no electrographic seizures during this.
Currently she was weaned off of the ventilator to just a trach mask at 40% FIO2 and has been oxygenating well.
Recent chest x-ray showed some atelectasis versus consolidation in the left lower lobe, which has been present throughout the hospital course, but this does not appear to be getting worse.
No specific MRSA organism was ever identified and cultures from the CSF as I mentioned were negative.
There were a couple of sputum samples showing gram-positive cocci in pairs, and on [**3-10**], the report on the Gram stain gram-negative rods and gram-positive rods 2+ and 3+, but the respiratory culture shows only sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora.
Urine cultures remained negative throughout the hospital course.
q.d., hold for blood pressure less than 100.
for blood pressure control, and please hold for systolic blood pressure less than 100 and a heart rate less than 60.
