Compared to the previous tracing P waves are no longer visible suggesting junctional rhythm.
CT Chest W/Contrast [**2139-11-29**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Femoral Line Placement and PTC [**2139-12-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
Balloon sphincteroplasty was then performed with a wire-guided CRE balloon and the ampulla/distal CBD was successfully dilated to 15 mm.
Repeat ERCP in 1 month for stent removal and complete duct clearance.
Pending Studies: Wound Swab Culture from [**2139-12-29**].
LFTs were normal, but an abdominal ultrasound showed a dilated common bile duct.
Once the patient was hemodynamically stable a repeat ERCP was performed which was notable for choledocholithiasis and a sphincterotomy with stone extraction was performed and a biliary stent was placed.
She has obstructive sleep apnea and was instructed to wear her BIPAP at night once discharged.
Since Coumadin was held for the patient's ERCP, the patient required a heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin until INR was therapeutic at goal [**2-19**].
Renal was made aware and cultures were taken but the Renal team did not want to start empiric antibiotics.
The cultures will be followed by outpatient Nephrology and antibiotics started as indicated.
Cultures were obtained and will need follow up.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check daily INR and CBC on [**12-31**] to ensure that patient is therapeutic on warfarin and that hct is not downtrending (last Hct on discharge was 24.3).
Cholangitis 2.
