Flexible bronchoscopy noted that his subglottic airway was narrowed to 5 mm.
Subsequent bronchoscopy revealed the length of the stenosis to be approximately 3 cm and quite proximal, involving the circumferential cricoid.
Pertinent Results: Chest CT scan [**3-6**] There is severe short segment (1.2 cm) subglottic tracheal stenosis.
CXR [**3-18**] INDICATION: Postop tracheal stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: pt was admitted and flexible bronchoscopy revealed tracheal stenosis which was dilated via rigid bronchoscopy.
On POD# and a flexible bronch was performed to eval the anastomosis.
