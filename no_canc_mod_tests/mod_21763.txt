Course at OSH notable for NSTEMI and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac evaluation.
However, 4PM on Sunday [**5-11**], he developed dry heaves so went to an [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital ED.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
On the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was noted to be tachypneic; VS: BP 147/87, P=114, RR=28, with 02 sat of 78-88%.
PCWP 15, PA (54/28 mean 39).
Pt dropped SBP to 40 with minimal pulse pressure A and PA tracings.
Pt noted to have blood in ETT and pt auto-PEEPed, having to be removed from vent transiently.
Had bronchoscopy performed which showed no endobronchial lesions, bronchomalasia, and some bilateral hemoptysis L>R.
Pertinent Results: Cardiac catheterization [**2183-5-12**]- 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed minimally elevated right sided filling pressures (mean RA pressure was 9 mm Hg and RVEDP was 11 mm Hg).
Pulmonary artery pressures were moderately elevated (PA pressure was 50/28 mm Hg).
Left sided filling pressures were minimally elevated (mean PCW pressure was 15 mm Hg).
Central arterial pressure was normal (on vasopressors) (aortic pressure was 97/66 mm Hg).
Cardiac index was normal (at 3.3 L/min/m2).
The calcified aortic valve was not able to crossed and thus left ventricular pressures and left ventriculography were not performed.
Before the case as well as during, the patient had copious frothy and blood secretions suctioned from his endotrachael tube.
CPR was initiated and his pressures promptly improved with administration of epinephrine.
At one point, his pressure was noted to drop into the 80s systolic and he was removed from mechanical ventilation transiently with a large gush of expelled air and a prompt improvement in his blood pressure (suggestive of significant auto-PEEP).
A stat echocardiogram was performed and revealed depressed myocardial function, a thickened aortic valve, and a mean aortic valve gradient of 20 mm Hg.
An IABP was placed though there was no systolic unloading secondary to the patient's tachycardia.
Left sided filling pressures were moderately to severely elevated (mean PCW pressure was 28/30 mm Hg).
Cardiac index remained normal, albeit lower than before the code (at 2.5 L/min/m2).
Moderately to severely elevated left sided filling pressures post cardiac arrest.
____________________________________________________ Echo [**2183-5-12**]- 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
ECHO Study Date of [**2183-6-9**] The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably moderately depressed; ejection fraction difficult to assess due to the presence of bigeminy (EF ?35%).
Right ventricular systolic function is probably mildly depressedl.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2183-5-12**], the studies are technically suboptimal for comparison.
Left ventricular systolic function may be similar but cannot be adequatley compared give differences in heart rate and rhythm between the 2 studies.
GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2183-6-4**] Blood flow images show no areas of abnormal tracer accumulation.
Delayed blood pool images obtained six hours after injection of tracer show accumulation of tracer in the right colon and hepatic flexure, with subsequent progression of tracer into the transverse colon.

Catheterization showed 3VD and initially it was thought that pt needed high risk intervention vs. CABG.
Peak enzymes were: CK 793, CK-MB 145, [**5-12**] trop 2.03 [**5-13**].
Ultimately, as patient's blood pressure improved following resolution of multiple infections, patient was able begin medical managment of coronary artery disease with lisinopril and metoprolol as well as continuing atorvastatin and aspirin.
Following clinical stabilization, echocardiography was repeated, which, although a poor study given ventricular bigeminy, revealed an EF of 35% and mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggested impaired relaxation.
His heart rate improved to the 60s-80s.
He was double covered for gram (-) w/Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin but tapered to Levaquin  alone when sputum grew out H. flu.
Chest CT that day showed LLL PNA & bilat atelectasis & small pleural effusions (?aspiration).
d. Sarcoidosis- Inactive during this hospitalization, however, bronchoscopy revealed a left lower lobe endobronchial nodule on the day prior to discharge.
He had multiple episode of frank melena with blood clots.
CT abd/pelvis (done for some bruising on flanks & Hct not bumping appropriately) was negative for RP bleed.
Initial upper endoscopy and tagged RBC study were negative on HD #11.
As patient continued to have frank melena intermittently, three additional nuclear medicine bleeding studies were performed, and patient underwent colonoscopy as well as push enteroscopy; the last bleeding study revealed a source in the hepatic flexure of the colon.
Renal: Patient initially had acute renal failure, with creatinine max of 1.7.
