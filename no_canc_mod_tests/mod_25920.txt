Because the patient continued to saturate at 87% on RA, she was discharged to rehabilitation on [**2117-11-2**] w/ 2L supplemental O2 by NC and a steroid taper.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after CT abdomen showed a large multilobulated pancreatic pseudocyst possibly compressing the CBD.
The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin trended down indicating that the restenting of the biliary system had succesfully decompressed the obstruction.
Repeat abdominal CT that showed the pancreatic pseudocyst had shrunk, but there was an increased amount of intra-peritoneal fluid, particularly in the left gutter.
A drain was inserted into the paracolic gutter, which showed an amylase level of [**Numeric Identifier 61575**], suggesting that the patient's pseudocyst had ruptured, either before the patient's ERCP or at some point in her hospital course.
This morning, following ERCP yesterday, she spiked fevers to 102, became hypotensive to 80s systolic and HR to 150s.

CV: The patient was initially hypotensive upon admission with SBP in the 80s.
A CVL was placed and she was started on levo/phenylephrine drip to keep SBP > 100.
The phenylephrine was weaned as patient's BP tolerated, and by HD3 it was stopped.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Initially, the patient's WBC was elevated with a peak of 34 on HD2, but this came down rapidly and was normal upon discharge.
ID was consulted and recommended amikacin, aztreonam, daptomycin, and clindamycin, which the patient was started on HD 2.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
You will have a CT scan performed on the day of your visit.
