Endoscopy revealed bleeding esophageal varices which were banded x 3 but she continued to bleed and required a repeat endoscopy the following day with three more bands placed to achieve hemostasis.
CT head revealed large areas of brain edema in the parietal and temporal lobes.
Her serum osm was 314.
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Also, just prior to transfer, sputum culture from [**2180-12-18**] grew MRSA and she was begun on vancomycin.
Max was 2 pack/day, though now ~[**10-2**] cigarettes/day.

CT head [**2180-12-21**]: IMPRESSION: Bilateral temporal lobe edema with effacement of the subjacent temporal horns of the lateral ventricle temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricles.
MRI can help for firther assessment.
EEG [**2180-12-22**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured one electrographic seizure with onset in the left temporal region, which then spread to both hemispheres and lasted for about two minutes.
Normal CT angiography and CT venography with no vascular stenosis or occlusion, and no venous thrombosis.
[**12-24**] CT Head IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI of the head is the best modality for evaluation of the white matter disease and cerebral edema.
[**1-4**] CXR Bibasilar atelectasis are grossly unchanged.
DISCHARGE LABS: WBC 4 HCT 31.5 PLT 63 .
Subseuqently found to have cerebral edema, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Head CT revealed the cerebral edema.
TSH was checked and was normal.
CT head upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU revealed bilateral cerebral edema, primarily of the temporal lobes, most concerning for HSV encephalitis.
Neurology was consulted and recommeded EEG and empiric coverage for HSV encephalitis with acyclovir (10mg/kg Q8H).
No recommendation was made for mannitol initially given her sodium of > 150, but when sodium dropped below 150 on [**2179-12-22**], several doses of mannitol were given.
Serum Osm was in the low 300s.
Neuro recommended stopping mannitol on [**2180-12-23**], and starting hypertonic saline instead to reach sodium goal 150-155.
Sodium and serum osmolarity monitored Q6H.
Her continuous EEG showed evidence of seizure activity at that time, and she was loaded with Keppra and maintenance dose begun.
Serial repeat 24h video EEGs showed no further seziures, although she remained intubated and on propofol.
Serial head imaging revealed stable cerebral edema but no evidence of CVA.
On [**12-26**] a head MRI revealed not only diffuse bitemporal abnormailties as previously seen, but also extension into the grey matter, concerning for prior anoxic brain injury.
Eventually neuro agreed with d/c'ing hypertonic saline and letting sodium drift down to 140 (but not below).
A repeat EEG was ordered per neurology to re-evaluate for subclinical seizure, which was without any evidence of seizure.
Her prognosis is uncertain as to recovery from her anoxic brain injury, and she is left with significant mental deficits (oriented to person only at time of transfer).
Culture data remained negative except for the MRSA in sputum from OSH and from intial presentation here.
She had 3 bands placed by EGD on [**2180-12-14**], and repeat banding x 3 on [**2180-12-15**].
Unfortunately, MRI scans of your head showed evidence of anoxic (lack of blood flow) brain injury, which may have occcurred from either blood loss or swelling around the brain.
