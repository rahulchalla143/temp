CXR did not demonstrate signs of PTX or new infection; given worsening symptoms, patient transferred to MICU for further management.

Right pleura, biopsy (B): Chronic fibrosing pleuritis.
# Hepatic Hydrothorax: Pt was previously receiving biweekly thoracentesis for management of hepatic hydrothorax but past several taps have come back bloody with hct of pleural fluid ranging from 4 to 13.
Pt was evaluated by thoracic surgery and CT with talc pleurodesis was performed twice.
Pleural fluid analysis was consistent with hepatic hydrothorax and cultures and cytology were negative.
On day prior to discharge, CXR revealed no new effusion indicating successful pleurodesis.
PTX, PE and worsening pleural effusion were all ruled out.
CXR revealed R cardiac border infiltrate and pt's WBC increased to 27K.
His oxygen saturation remained stable on 2L NC in ICU and he was transferred back to the floor.
# Distributive shock - pt w hypotension to SBP 80s, tachycardia, borderline febrile on floor, but afebrile by the time he was transferred to unit.
Blood cultures never speciated but pt met SIRS criteria and had suspected PNA suggesting sepsis as cause of shock.
CVPs in unit were consistently <8 which responded to 500cc fluid boluses suggesting distributive rather than cardiogenic etiology.
He was empirically covered with Vanc/Zosyn and he received 8 L of 500cc boluses over course of MICU stay until his CVPs were consistently around [**8-26**].
His ascites worsened in setting of chest tube draining hydrathorax and 8L NS boluses.
Stool was negative for O&P and pt was not on any medication that would be responsible for eosinophilia.

We found that your blood count was low and treated you with two units of blood.
The purpose of this procedure is the scar the lining of your lung against your chest wall to prevent fluid from re-accumulating in that space.
