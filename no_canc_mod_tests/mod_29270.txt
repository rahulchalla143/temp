COMPARISON: [**5-11**] /06.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery disease in this right dominant circulation.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP=27 mmHg, LVEDP=33mmHg and mean PCWP=33mmHg.
Cardiac output and index were 4.3 L/min and 2.0 L/min/m2 respectively.
The mean gradient was 88 mmHg with calculated [**Location (un) 109**]=0.4 cm2.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed globally..
