PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Albuterol prn  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination demonstrated a heartrate of 60, blood pressure 160/80, respiratory rate, the patient was on an Ambu bag with pulse oximetry being 99 and 100%.
He was intubated and unresponsive to examination on initial presentation at [**Hospital6 256**].
His chest and lungs demonstrated poor breathsounds bilaterally but were clear.
His cardiac was S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm.
His extremities were 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses and rectal showed normal tone and was guaiac negative.
LABORATORY DATA:  His initial laboratory values demonstrated a hematocrit of 41, white count 24, INR 1.8, amylase 72.
Urinalysis demonstrated large blood.
The patient underwent a wide variety of imaging which included head and face computerized tomography scan, cervical spine computerized tomography scan, right wrist films, tibia-fibula films, chest computerized tomography scan of abdomen, abdominal pelvis computerized tomography scan as well.
His airway was changed in the Intensive Care Unit the night of hospital day #1.
Initial evaluation by the Neurosurgery Service, their assessment was that the needed to be reversed.
Following reversal of his coagulation factors, the patient was found to have an INR of 1.2.
His initial neurological examination demonstrated movement of bilateral upper extremities to pain, no eye opening or ability to follow commands.
They were to control intracranial pressures for less than 25, wanting an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery for mandibular fractures.
Chest tubes were placed for his pneumothoraces with an initial positive end-expiratory pressure measuring 10.
Following this intubation, auscultation suggested a right lung collapse and pneumothorax with aspiration consolidation.
Vital signs were stable and a post intubation gas was 7.13, 42, 54, 19 and -11, which was probably felt due to the chest contusion and collapse of the lungs.
On [**2175-3-22**], the patient was taken by the Orthopedic Service to the Operating Room where an incision and drainage of the left and right proximal tibia were performed.
An external fixator was applied to the left tibia and femur.
His goal intracranial pressure remained less than 25.
His goal carbon dioxide was to be kept approximately 35.
Initial evaluation by the Ophthalmology Service occurred on [**2175-3-22**].
Additionally on [**2175-3-23**] the patient spiked a temperature to 102 degrees.
On [**3-23**], the patient was taken to the Angiography Suite along with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the Neurosurgical Service for an angiography which ruled out any damage to the vertebral arteries, carotid arteries both internal and external.
Over night from [**3-23**] to [**3-24**], the patient continued to have high intracranial pressures with pressures ranging anywhere from 2 to 37.
The neurological examination remained 4 where he was simply localizing in his upper extremities bilaterally and moving his legs spontaneously.
His intracranial pressures resided in the range of 17 to 28 over these nights.
The neurological examination remained unchanged.
All cultures including cerebrospinal fluid cultures remained negative.
His neurological examination, pupils 4.5 mm and nonreactive and spontaneous movement.
Over the next several days the pentobarbital effect wore off and the patient subsequently recovered his previous neurological examination which was spontaneous movement of all extremities and eye opening.
Following withdrawal of the pentobarbital the patient's intracranial pressures remained stable in the 20 to 30 range.
The patient additionally developed diabetes insipidus and a rise in his serum sodium to 170.
From [**3-30**], to [**3-31**], the patient's intracranial pressures remained in the 20 to 30 range and the drain drained approximately 102 cc over night.
The neurological examination remained unchanged.
Over night from [**4-2**] to [**4-3**], the patient's intracranial pressures remained fairly stable with a peak of approximately 36.
Following withdrawal of his pentobarbital again his neurological examination was followed for the best clinical examination for a number of days in order to obtain the prognosis for Mr. [**Known lastname 46871**].
On [**2175-4-3**], the patient's white blood cell count was stable and he had been afebrile for a number of days, it was decided to begin withdrawing the patient's antibiotics.
On [**2175-4-4**], the patient's intracranial pressures continued to get better with a mean value of 20, 13 and 17.
His neurological examination improved somewhat since his barbiturate levels dropped.
At that point his examination was noted to be with good corneal reflexes, brisk pupillary reflexes and spontaneous movement of all extremities.
