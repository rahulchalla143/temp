The patient underwent cardiac catheterization in [**2137**] which revealed patent bypass graft.
The patient underwent a follow up stress test in [**2142-5-22**] which showed ischemic ST changes.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization in [**2142-6-22**] which showed occluded vein grafts of the right coronary artery with native three vessel coronary artery disease and an ejection fraction of 33%.
Vitamin B 8.
The patient initially required Levophed drip for maintenance of the blood pressure.
Upon arrival to the Intensive Care Unit the patient underwent a bronchoscopy which showed normal mucosa, copious thin secretions and a small plug in the left lower lobe.
A sputum sample was sent from the bronchoscopy.
Chest x-ray after intubation showed diffuse interspace disease, right greater than left.
The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severely depressed left ventricular systolic function with ejection fraction of 20 to 25% with inferior akinesis, lateral hypokinesis, moderately depressed right ventricular systolic function, moderate mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation.
All of the cultures from that time were negative with the exception of a sputum sample done during bronchoscopy which was positive for Methicillin-sensitive Coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was minimal growth.
All subsequent sputum, blood and urine cultures were negative.
On postoperative day #4 the patient had a pulmonary artery catheter placed to rule out cardiogenic pulmonary edema that showed a cardiac output of 7.2 and a cardiac index of 3.17, SVR of 715.
The patient's positive end-expiratory pressure and sedation were weaned.
Blood cultures were sent which were negative.
The patient's white count during this time remained steady in the 13 to 15 range.
A neurological consult was obtained which neurology felt that the majority of his problem was probably due to metabolic and infectious causes, however, felt that it could be due to a stroke and recommended an magnetic resonance imaging scan at a future date to further delineate this.
The patient began to follow commands and move all extremities to command, and their recommendations were changed to consider the magnetic resonance imaging scan if the patient did not continue to progress.
It was noted about this time that the patient had an area of skin abrasion on his lower coccyx and gluteal cleft.
Fever curve decreased by postoperative day #11, temperature maximum was 98.
The Vancomycin and the Flagyl were discontinued as the patient had no positive culture, was continued on the Levofloxacin.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature maximum 96.5, pulse 78 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 95/60, respiratory rate 18, room air oxygen saturation 95%, patient's weight on [**11-8**] was 90.1 kg.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed white blood cell count 13.1, sodium 136, potassium 5.0, chloride 98, bicarbonate 29, BUN 27, creatinine 1.1, glucose 104.
The patient has a chest x-ray pending for [**11-8**].
Regular insulin sliding scale for blood sugar 120 to 150, give 1 unit subcutaneously, for blood sugar 150 to 200 give 3 units subcutaneously, for blood sugar 201 to 250 give 5 units subcutaneously, for blood sugar of 251 to 300 give 7 units subcutaneously, for blood sugar of 301 to 350 give 9 units, subcutaneous, for blood sugar greater than 350 give 11 units subcutaneously.
