Bcx from [**6-24**]: Gram neg rods (prelim)  CXR from [**6-25**]:  In comparison with the study of [**6-24**], there is little overall changein the extensive left-sided pneumonia that involves much of this side of the lung.
Widespread air-bronchograms are again seen.
CT head from [**6-23**]:  no intracranial pathology  RUQ US fro [**6-23**]:  Coarsened and echogenic liver with probable focal areas of focal fatty sparing.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2182-6-26**] 4:38 PM Large consolidation in the left upper and mid lung, consistent with infectious process appears to be minimally different from the prior study with no obvious evidence of improvement.
BP also came up to SBP 104 after half of her bolus.
Pneumonia: Initial CXR in ED showed left perihilar opacity consistent with pna.
with continued fevers, we obtained a repeat the next evening which showed worsening of her pna to include upper and lower lobes.
On the floor pt had a urine culture that was positive for legionella; after consultation with ID, the pt was switched to Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for an abiotic course of 10days.
Her head CT was negative.
We ordered hep serologies which were negative and trended the LFTs which generally improved over time but findings on US were suggestive of chronic liver diases.
Of note, LFT elevations are also common with Streptococcal pneumonia and legionella; given the positive legionella urine test this was likely the cause.
You were given multiple antibiotics to treat this, in addition to fluids to help keep your blood pressure up.
However, the next morning your blood pressure and oxygen levels dropped low, and you were transferred to the intensive care unit for further management.
However, because of the severity of the pneumonia which you had, you will need to remain on home oxygen for a short time while you finish your antibiotics and recover.
It will also be very important to follow-up with your PCP (see appointment scheduled below) and to have a repeat chest xray in [**1-24**] weeks to ensure that your pneumonia has resolved.
While you were in the hospital, it was found that tests of your liver function were abnormal and an ultrasound showed changes in your liver that were suggestive of chronic liver disease.
Also, it was found that you blood sugar was high and a test over you blood showed that your hemoglobin A1C (which is a measure of chronic high glucose in your blood) was elevated.
Blood tests also showed that the number of red bloods was low and that you had anemia.
This should be further evalutated by your regular doctor to ensure that you red blood cell count returns to normal after you recover from your pneumonia.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Start taking Levofloxacin 750 mg daily; please be sure to complete the entire course of your antibiotic which will end on [**7-7**] for a total course of 10 days begun on [**2182-6-27**].
- Reduce your dose of Amitriptyline 25 mg PO daily instead of 75mg given that your levels were found to be high while in the hospital; you will need to discuss with your PCP whether to resume your previous dose.
- Please use your home oxygen to ensure that the level of oxygen in your blood is >93%.
