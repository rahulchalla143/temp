HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old female with non-insulin dependent-diabetes and COPD, whose cardiac history is significant for coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2133**], PTCA, RCA stent in [**2152**], hypertension, dyslipidemia, CHF with an ejection fraction of 25% on a transthoracic echocardiogram done [**2158-2-3**], who was evaluated for BiV placement secondary to decreased exercise tolerance and shortness of breath over the last several years.
Vital signs were hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.
Patient complained of left sided chest pain and had ongoing nausea on [**2158-2-3**] that prompted a transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed a small pericardial effusion with thrombus formation over the right ventricle without evidence of tamponade.
However, she began to experience increasing nausea and heaviness in the chest, and a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram revealed slightly increased effusion size of approximately 1.5 cm.
During the course of the hospitalization, patient had remained hemodynamically stable with blood pressures 118-156/55-70, sats 96-98% on [**3-2**] liters of O2.
CHF with an EF of 25%.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 97.9, blood pressure 118-156/40-66, pulse 61-101.
Blood glucoses ranging 148-225.
Respiratory rate 18-22.
Pulmonary exam:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular exam:  S1, S2 regular, 2/6 systolic murmur right upper sternal border.
Neurological exam is nonfocal.
Transthoracic echocardiogram shows an echo-dense effusion.
LABORATORIES:  White count 8.4, hematocrit 34.5, platelets 149.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 78-year-old woman with noninsulin-dependent diabetes with history of CAD, CHF with an ejection fraction of 25%.
Patient had a frequent monitoring of her pulsus paradoxus, which ranged from [**12-12**], but did not increase.
Patient was started [**2-6**] on an amiodarone dose of 400, then changed to 200 t.i.d.
Thyroid function and liver function was assessed.
TSH was 1.3 this admission, AST 17, ALT 10.
Pump:  Patient had an EF notable for 25%.
It was noted from patient's previous admission one year prior that she had similar sats on room air as well as a full set of pulmonary function tests.
Hematology:  Patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 27.
Nausea and vomiting:  Patient initially experienced nausea and vomiting on [**2-3**] leading to the transthoracic echocardiogram that demonstrated her pericardial effusion.
Cultures and Clostridium difficile were sent.
Cultures are pending upon patient's discharge.
Patient was sent for a head CT to rule out a mass that would lead to nocturnal vomiting.
Head CT was negative.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%.
Patient will follow up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 496**] in Cardiac services, [**2158-2-24**].
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96, blood pressure 128/85, heart rate 85, patient is [**Age over 90 **]% on 2 liters of O2.
Patient is tolerating p.o., ambulating well, and room air sats are less than 90%.
