Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-6-12**], left ventricular systolic function is improved with lack of regional dysfunction.
[**2166-7-28**] CT head/ sinus: IMPRESSION:  Similar appearance of cystic encephalomalacia and other atrophic changes in the brain.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, infections, and anoxia are among the most common causes of encephalopathy.
[**2166-8-3**] CT chest/abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**8-5**] Trans esophageal echo Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

ANCA neg [**Doctor First Name **] neg dsDNA neg   Brief Hospital Course: # Fever:  Febrile to 101.6 in ED where she received IV ceftriaxone and vancomycin without clear infiltrate on CXR but has extensive h/o aspiration pneumonia and was recently treated for VAP for which she completed a course of meropenem and vancomycin prior to d/c on [**7-4**].
Blood and urine cultures were sent in the ED.
Did have elevated WBC count to 13.7, but no notable left shift and all cell lines appeared to be up suggesting hemoconcentration.
Her vancomycin level was noted to be elevated so was held while levels resolve.
TTE and TEE showed no vegitations, CT abd showed no abscess.
LP negative for meningitis, cryptococcus negative, viral culture still pending.
She continued to spike fevers after she was treated, ID was consulted, review of culture data showed that she has a sub-population of ESBL resistant klebsiella and so she was subsequently treated with meropenem.
C.diff toxin assay was negative, however given concern a B-toxin was sent which is currently pending.
Although CXR on [**8-11**] was read as having consolidation in left lower lobe, she was clinically much improved with fever curve trending down.
During her hospitalization, non-infectious sources of fever were considered as well.
She should have a repeat CXR in a few weeks to assess for resolution of pneumonia.
Overall antibiotic regimen included: vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6958**]; [**7-28**] - [**8-6**] zosyn [**Date range (1) 6959**]; [**Date range (1) 6960**]; [**8-2**] - [**8-4**] meropenem 1g IV q8h [**8-4**] - [**8-18**] (planned) amikacin [**8-8**] - [**8-21**] (planned) Flagyl [**7-14**] - [**7-16**]; [**8-2**] - [**8-21**] (planned) fluconazole [**7-16**] - [**7-19**] Vori 200 PO BID [**8-4**] - [**8-8**] cipro [**7-28**]- [**7-28**] CTX [**7-13**] - [**7-13**] Bactrim [**7-17**] - [**7-21**] Linezolid [**8-8**] - [**8-11**] .
?seizure on day of admission seems more likely [**1-10**] to severe hypoglycemia as opposed to structural abnormalities post CVA acting as epileptiform nidus.
A [**2166-6-11**] EEG did not reveal e/o seizure/epileptiform activity.
CT head r/o acute IC process/ new stroke since [**6-27**].
Blood sugars still fairly variable, however given that she presented for hypoglycemia, we erred on the side of higher blood sugars.
Josline diabetes service had been considering switching to [**Hospital1 **] lantus regimen at discharge but as blood sugars currently stable she was not changed.
This could be considered if blood glucose is variable in the future.
# ARF:  Baseline creatinine is 0.7-1.0 and was found to be elevated to 1.7 on ED presentation (while it was normal on d/c on [**7-4**]).
She initially had a low bicarbonate (low of 17) and urine electrolytes suggested renal tubular acidosis.
Interventional pulmonology performed bronchoscopy which showed that the trach was in good position but did show largyngeal inflammation suggestive of GE reflux.
Metoprolol restarted at low doses and blood pressure began to increase in the week before discharge.
Recent iron studies during last hospitalization are c/w AOCD w/ low TIBC, elevated ferritin.
# Eosinophilia Eosinophils rose to 7/8 on [**8-9**] and a maximum of 12.5 on [**8-11**].
She should have a repeat eosinophil count in a few days to confirm that it has gone down.
# ?DVT: given cool extremities with decreased pulses noted [**7-25**] but doppler U/S was negative on two occassions.
# R breast mass: US evaluation as outpatient .

You low blood sugars were likely due fevers and to changes in your tube feeding regimen and resolved with steady tube feed intake and close monitoring of your blood sugars.
