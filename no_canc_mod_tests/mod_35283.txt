GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %) with basal inferior and basal septal hypokinesis.
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in standing upright position.
Review of the previous chest examinations is performed and it is noted that the preoperative examination of [**2121-2-10**] was performed with the patient in supine position.
Consequently, an additional chest followup examination after a longer interval is recommended to document full clearance.
Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to cardiac surgery after catheterization at OSH revealed 3VD with preserved EF.
In summary he had CABGx4 with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-AM-RCA, his bypass time was 103 minutes with a crossclamp of 85 minutes.
His echo the following day was improved and his IABP was weaned and removed.
Additionally he was seen by vascular for decreased pulses in right foot while the IABP was in place, his exam improved once the IABP was removed.
