ECG [**5-17**]: Sinus rhythm with borderline sinus tachycardia and ventricular premature beat.
TTE [**5-17**]: The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images not available for review) of [**2121-8-30**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has probably increased.
LV systolic  Historical imaging:  The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded - the apex is not well seen.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be estimated.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 18%.
2) Severe left ventricular enlargement with global hypokinesis and an LVEF of 18%.
CARDIAC CATH: Per prior discharge summary: OSH records for cath performed in [**3-4**].
The Cx was considered as a non-jeopardized side branch and the origin was stented across.
TTE [**2120**]: The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE:  On admission to the ED clinical picture was consistent with pulmonary edema,  CXR notable for pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral effusions.
Her O2 Sat fell and Bipap was started.
Peri-intubation her blood pressure fell to 60s (despite only 5 of PEEP).
Repeat ABG prior to transfer, 7.28/41/69 on 500/15, 100% FiOx, PEEP 8 On arrival to the CCU her MAPs>60 on combination levophed and dopamine; O2 saturations 100% on FiO2 100 Vt: 500 24/8.
ABG on arrival 7.35 CO2: 35 O2 204.
LOS at discharge from CCU was -5L.
Other potential causes are thought unlikely: she had no signs or symptoms of infection, Ucx and Bcx were negative; her clinical complaints, EKG, TTE and biomarkers were not suggestive of an ischemic event.
Ventricular rate was as high as 170 and in this setting patient got shocked by her ICD 7 times without conversion.
Baseline creatinine 1.3-1.8.
Cr was 1.5 on dsicharge.
