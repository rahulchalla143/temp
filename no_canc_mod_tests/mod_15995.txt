A MRI scan of the head shows a third ventricle hyperintense lesion in T1 weighted images, which does not enhance causing mild-to-moderate increased size in the lateral ventricles.
Sensory examination reveals some decreased touch sensation over the left neck posterior to the ear and the occipital areas as well as along the neck to the upper part of the anterior chest.
On MRI scan of the head, the third ventricles tumor is an incidental finding.
Head CT was performed on [**2124-10-11**].
