[**2179-6-12**] CT C-spine: 1.
[**2179-6-13**] CT Head: Stable epidural hematoma overlying the right parietal lobe.
[**2179-6-14**] CT Chest: 1.
Status post right breast surgery with post-surgical changes including low-density collection which might represent seroma, please correlate with dedicated imaging.
This is stable in size since the [**2179-6-13**] study and decreased compared to [**2179-5-13**].
Stable right parietal epidural hematoma since the [**2179-6-13**] study and decreased compared to [**2179-5-13**].
ECG [**2179-6-16**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2179-6-13**] lateral T wave changes are not as apparent on the current tracing.
Compared to tracing #1 lateral ST-T wave changes are not seen on the current tracing.
Her CXR had what was likely a resolving pneumonia.
Her respiratory status improved and O2 sats were 90s on room on air on discharge from the ICU.
She had Chest CT for evaluation of possible lung malignancy.
Her CT did not show evidence of malignancy.
While on the floors she remained asymptomatic and her oxygen saturations were normal on room air.
Her neuro exam remained unchanged and serial CT scans did not show expansion of the hematoma.
Her blood pressures were elevated one night on the floor to the 200s/100s.
Her pressures remained under 160 with this new regimen.
Per neurosurgery, her goal SBP is less than 160.
We recommend that she takes this medicine at night as her blood pressure trend showed higher pressures at night.
# CKD:  The patient's creatinine trended down to 1.2 on the day of discharge.
Ortho was called and recommended outpatient evaluation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
# UTI: Patient had a positive UA on [**6-17**] and urine culture was no growth to date at time of discharge.
# PENDING Labs at time of discharge: Urine culture no growth to date on [**6-18**] after 2 days.
