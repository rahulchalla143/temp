His chest pain did improve with rest but continued to linger for several days.
Subsequent stress test on [**2193-12-9**] showed return of his anginal symptoms.
Troponins were noted to be elevated at that time.
Repeat cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 **] revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease with restenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Preserved biventricular systolic function post cpb with LVEF now 55%.
Preoperative evaluation was otherwise unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery.
