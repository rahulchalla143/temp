She has had 6-7 years of progressively worsening SOB and has had an extensive prior workup (please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 84946**] notes) including an open lung biopsy in [**10/2118**] which was initially thought to show sarcoidosis, but after re-review is more consistent with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
In the ED initial VS were: afebrile, HR 115, RR in the 30s, sats in the mid-80s which improved to 99% after a neb.
On exam she was taking rapid shallow breaths with poor air movement so got 3 back-to-back nebs with some improvement.
VS prior to transfer were HR 134, BP 111/56, RR 27, 98% on a continuous neb.
(Had open lung biopsy in [**10/2118**] which was reviewed by [**Hospital1 18**] pathologists and showed undefined inflammatory process superimposed on normal lung,and poorly formed granulomas that seemed to be consistent with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis) 3.
She states the reason for no INH was a clear CXR 4.

IMAGING: CXR (PA and lateral) [**2119-6-6**]: Lung volumes are improved compared with prior.
Cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal.
EKG [**2119-6-7**]: Sinus tachycardia.
***CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND  [**2119-6-7**]: FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear, with evidence of prior wedge biopsy from the right upper and lower lobes.
At the level of the clavicular heads, the trachea measures 2.3 cm AP x 1.6 cm TV (314 mm2), which on dynamic expiration decreases to 1.1 cm AP x 0.9 cm TV (56 mm2) (6; 9, 5; 14).
At the level of the aortic arch, the trachea measures 1.8 cm AP x 2.5 cm TV (350 mm2) on inspiration, which on dynamic expiration decreases to 0.6 cm AP x 1.2 cm TV (59 mm2).
The right and left bronchi measure 1.3 and 1.4 cm, respectively, on the inspiratory phase (2; 27) which progresses to near-complete collapse, measuring less than 2 mm on dynamic expiration (5; 24).
The bronchus intermedius measures 6 mm on inspiration (2; 27) and 3 mm on expiration (5; 28).
Though this exam is not tailored for the evaluation of infradiaphragmatic structures, no abnormality is seen.
Acute issues: # Tracheobronchomalacia (NEW DIAGNOSIS): Patient states symptoms are similar to prior asthma exacerbations  but no wheezing on exam and CXR shows no hyperinflation of lungs.
CT Trachea performed and showed severe tracheobronchomalacia.
Additional workup to be performed as an outpatient with possible stenting in a few weeks.
EKG unremarkable.
Information was obtained from webOMR MICU.
A CT scan was performed looking at your breathing tubes.
