Head CT MRI read as normal.
Neurology consulted; no focal deficits seen on exam but EEG revealed status epilepticus with R temporal predominance.

[**8-8**], [**8-9**] EEG This 24 hour EEG telemetry initially was notable for a burst suppression pattern, followed by intermittent predominantly bitemporal epileptiform discharges and slowing within these same regions.

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2190-8-12**]):       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
[**2190-8-26**] 06:03PM STOOL CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN B ASSAY- detected  Brief Hospital Course: This 84 year old woman with atrial fib, CHF, HTN in non-convulsive status epilepticus also with recent digoxin toxicity and UTI presented to this hospital for management of her status epilepticus.
The cause of seizing was unknown and the differential included infection, stroke, or organic brain injury.
A lumbar puncture performed on transfer was unremarkable with no evidence of infection, all culture data was negative.
Initial EEG confirmed the presence of non-convulsive status epilepticus.
Propofol was transitioned to ativan drip as the patients blood pressure was somewhat labile on propofol.
After several days of an EEG without seizure activity, the Ativan drip was weaned and eventually discontinued.
C.Diff was negative x 3, and all blood/sputum cultures no growth.
She was empirically started on flagyl, but white count continued to rise and she did not have any diarrhea.
No definitive source for an infection was found until a colonoscopy revealed findings consistent with C. diff colitis (vs ischemic colitis).
Later, a send out test for C.Diff toxin B returned positive.
Her diastolic CHF was managed with antihypertensive and diuretic medications as needed.
