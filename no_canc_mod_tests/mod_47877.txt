Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]                       Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 16955**]  Admission Date:  [**2125-10-26**]     Discharge Date: [**2125-11-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2077-7-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  ADDENDUM:  HOSPITAL COURSE:  Starting at [**2125-11-5**]: The patient had a negative transthoracic echocardiogram and initially refused a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out bacterial endocarditis.
The patient had a hematocrit drop to 22.0.
However, the patient refused further hematocrit checks and further blood product replacement.
The patient finally agreed to have another set of surveillance cultures done on [**2125-11-12**].
The cultures came back positive with VRE necessitating removal of the tunneled catheter placement.
His surveillance cultures have been so far negative and since the patient has been off dialysis for seven days, temporal femoral hemodialysis line was successfully placed on [**2125-11-20**], and the patient was successfully dialyzed.
The patient also had a transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2125-11-19**], which was read as cannot exclude vegetations on aortic and mitral valves and therefore consistent with endocarditis necessitating six weeks therapy with Linezolid.
Gastrointestinal bleed - The patient had a flexible sigmoidoscopy done on [**2125-11-5**], which showed two rectal ulcers, no bleed.
A biopsy, however, did not confirm that these were ulcers.
For further diagnosis, a x-ray of either his wrists or his ankle needs to be done whenever the patient is compliant with this recommendation.
Behavioral issues - The patient has been noncompliant with many of his recommended therapies such as hemodialysis, daily laboratory draws, medication administration.
He was found to have his toxicology screen positive of Cocaine in his urine.
