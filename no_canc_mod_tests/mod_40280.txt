ICU course was complicated by hypernatremia to 150 which improved with free water boluses, agitation/delerium which improved with levetiracetam and haloperidol, sinus tachycardia to HR 150, and steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
MRI head negative.
# Febrile Neutropenia - Initially febrile when presented to outside hospital, and with WBC of 3.
Hem/onc was consulted for further assistance and performed a bone marrow biopsy on [**2165-10-31**] which was repeated [**2165-11-1**] due to inadequate specimen.
# Anemia - Initially his hematocrit was stable around 37 for most of his hospitalization, but on [**11-1**] it dropped to 30 and then subsequently to 26 later that day.
His LDH was up, but hapto was normal.
Transfusions: Platelets - 1 bag - [**11-1**] (for PICC placement).
# Diabetes: On U500 as an outpatient, with unclear glucose levels or insulin requirements.
CT head, ECHO, EEG all negative at OSH.
BPs were elevated to SBP of 190.
Given duration of illness and likelihood that sepsis would have declared itself, we resumed his beta-blockade with metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] with plans to resume [**Last Name (un) **] if BPs were stable on [**11-2**].
RUQ U/S (with dopplers) showed no gallbladder pathology with normal hepatic vasculature.
A bone marrow biopsy was done which revealed hypercellular bone marrow with increased apoptosis and occasional hemophagocytic histiocyte.
An EEG was performed, which was concerning for seizure activity.
As his EEG monitoring continued, this activity stopped and his antiepileptics were discontinued.
A head CT was done which did not reveal any abnormalities.
Transfused 1U PLTs [**2165-11-1**].
# Coagulopathy: PTT up to 71 (with Factor IX 41%) now normalized.
Transfused cryoprecipitate [**2165-11-4**] to keep fibrinogen >100.
MRI brain negative.
# Pulmonary Nodule:  CT with Scattered pulmonary nodules measuring up to 5 mm needs f/u CT in 12 months.
Lovaza- 1gm- 2 cap in AM, 2 in PM 6.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital directly from another hospital due to fainting (syncope), pancytopenia (low blood counts), [**Hospital **], altered mental state, and fever.
You needed transfusions of red blood cells, platelets, and clotting factors for a coagulopathy (bleeding disorder).
Dermatology performed a skin biopsy of a rash.
Hematology performed a bone marrow biopsy; this confirmed the diagnosis of HLH (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), a bone marrow disease that destroys blood cells.
During this time, an EEG showed seizure activity, so you were started on a seizure medication, levetiracetam (Keppra).
As the steroids and chemotherapy continued, you began feeling better, you did not need the ventilator, fevers resolved, and the liver function tests normalized.
Your blood counts remain low, a result of the HLH and chemotherapy, and you are continuing to need frequent blood transfusions.
Initially, you should have your blood counts (CBC) checked every other day and this can be spaced out if your need for transfusions declines.
