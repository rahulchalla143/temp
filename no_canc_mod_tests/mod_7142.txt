Limited examination demonstrates an endometrial stripe measuring 1.4 cm.
ECHO ([**2126-10-16**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-10-3**], probably at least mild pulmonary artery systolic pressures is now detected.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND ([**2126-10-17**]) 1.
Blood culture: negative HBV DNA: Not detected Urine culture ([**10-22**]): > 100K yeast Urine culture ([**10-24**]): 10K-100K yeast Right lower extremity wound/Catheter tip culture: Negative C Diff: Negative ([**10-25**] and [**10-31**]).
CIRRHOSIS/TRANSPLANT EVAL: The patient's MELD was consistently in the high 30's, including total bilirubin levels in the high 30's.
Repeat anti-[**Last Name (un) 15412**] was weakly positive at 1:40.
IgG levels were elevated at >[**2116**].
Culture data was generally negative, except for urine cultures revealing yeast.
Pre-transplant evaluation included an endometrial biopsy and pap smear that was negative for malignancy.
On [**11-2**], a donor liver was believed to be available, and the patient was taken to the pre-operative holding area.
Her temperature slowly decreased into the 95-96 range.
This was continued until [**11-2**], when the patient's creatinine was first noted to rise.
Her weights were not recorded on the floor, despite repeated requests to nursing to measure any weights, including bed weights.
As mentioned above, her culture data was negative and she was consistently afebrile.
Her temperature and blood pressure slowly trended down, and her antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and micafungin.
Fungal blood and urine cultures were sent, revealing no growth.
CTA of the neck revealed no thrombosis, abscess or fluid collection, and there was no fluctuance to exam.
Urinalysis showed [**2-28**] granular casts.
Her urine output also decreased significant, and she was olguric at time of transfer to MICU on [**11-7**].
She was kept on daily PPI and vitamin K. She remained on propanolol for several days, but this was discontinued on [**11-6**] for systolic BP in the 90's and also to not mask a potential tachycardic response.
She had small amounts of hematochezia several days prior to transfer to MICU, but hematocrit was generally stable at the time.
However, her hematocrit trended down slowly at time of transfer to MICU, and she was transfused.
Pap negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy.
