The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2162-12-11**] with pyuria, rigors, fevers to 106 and mental status changes as well as bilateral flank pain, urinalysis with 25-30 white cells but culture negative.
Blood culture during admission grew 202 bottles positive for Providencia Alcalifaciens sensitive to Imipenem and Levofloxacin.
DIC with a platelet count of 20,000; 5.
Subendocardial ischemia with a peak troponin of 1.47; 6.
Ejection fraction within normal limits, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, echocardiogram [**2160-11-21**]; 7.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient had a temperature maximum of 99.5 which is also his temperature currently, heartrate 79, blood pressure 154/49, respiratory rate 18 and he was 94% on vent settings of SIMV 700 by 12, 5 positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 pressure support.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, mucous membranes moist, endotracheal tube in place.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen, obese, soft, nontender, decreased bowel sounds.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed hematocrit of 30.1, white count 11.8, platelets 274, INR 1.3, PT 27.3.
Chemistries, sodium 146, potassium 4.3, chloride 108, bicarbonate 25, BUN 89, creatinine 5.7, glucose 95, calcium 8.5, magnesium 2.5 and phosphorus 6.1.
Chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure, possible right lower lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 80, normal axis, normal intervals, T wave inversions in the inferior and lateral leads, isolated Qs in L, slight ST depression in V4.
The patient's Foley catheter was changed on [**12-27**] and a repeat urinalysis was read as no evidence of infection.
Urine cultures were negative times two as of [**2162-12-31**].
His arterial blood gases was 7.26, 54 and 71, showing a hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.
MICU evaluation suggested that the patient suffered a respiratory arrest likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
A neurologic event was considered as the cause of this, however, the patient had a head computerized tomography scan with no significant changes.
Sputum cultures in the MICU grew out Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient was started on Vancomycin that was dosed renally by prn Vancomycin levels.
Abdominal computerized tomography scan showed no other obvious infections source.
His computerized tomography scan on [**2163-1-1**] showed bilateral pneumonia with no effusions, essentially normal abdomen.
Gastrointestinal - The patient had speech and swallow study during his admission that he failed.
The patient required transient hemodialysis but by [**1-4**] his creatinine was back to baseline levels at 2.2.
The patient also had a left temporal hemorrhage which was noted on magnetic resonance imaging scan and computerized tomography scan.
There was some concern that this hemorrhage might reflect malignancy/brain metastases, therefore the patient had pan computerized tomography scan which all ruled out malignancy.
As a consequence he was medically managed for his cardiac disease, treated with Aspirin and with blood pressure control.
For blood pressure control the patient was on Amlodipine 5 mg q.d.
Combivent 1 to 2 puffs inhaled q.
Lorazepam .5 to 1 mg intravenously q.
