# CORONARIES - The patient had a prior CABG in [**2143**] with (LIMA -> proximal LAD, SVG -> distal LAD, SVG -> OM2 and OM3) and is status-post PCI in [**6-/2153**] (DES to proximal LAD) with a persantine MIBI in [**7-/2157**] which showed his old LAD infarct and areas of ischemia in the distribution of the PDA and OM.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization via radial artery access on [**10-10**], where she had a distal RCA lesion, which by itself was not felt to be a culprit lesion and the patient also had stenosis about the area where one of her LIMA to LAD bypasses was.
The cath was only diagnostic in that no interventions on the coronaries were performed at that time, and at the same time it was discovered that the patient had irregularities of the bilateral femoral arteries on informal angiography.
We trended her EKG findings, monitored her for chest pain, and trended her Troponins and CK-MB for resolution of her NSTEMI concerns.
# PUMP (ACUTE CHF EXACERBATION)- The patient had her last 2D-Echo in [**7-/2160**] which showed symmetric LVH, moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with moderate global hypokinesis and akinesis of the distal anterior septum and apex and an LVEF of 30-35%.
Since then, her nausea persisted and her appetite became suppressed - but she was able to keep her medications down.
In the ED ([**2160-10-5**]) her VS 97.2 124/47 24 97% 2L NC.
A CXR showed pulmonary congestion.
Her creatinine baseline is around 3.8-4.0.
Her diuretics were held and her BUN trended from 181 -> 167, with a creatinine of 5.2 -> 5.0.
A CXR showed diffuse pulmonary edema, and it was difficult to assess whether an underlying apiration or consolidation was present.
Since then, her nausea persisted and her appetite became suppressed - but she was able to keep her medications down.
Her creatinine baseline is around 3.8-4.0.
Her diuretics were held and her BUN trended from 181 -> 167, with a creatinine of 5.2 -> 5.0.
A permanent HD-line was tunneled on [**2160-10-20**] without issue and she will continue on outpatient hemodialysis.
(Tuberculin testing negative [**10-12**], in OMR).
She underwent thrombin injection without avail and a repeat at thrombin injection which was again unsuccessful.
Serial ultrasound imaging was performed which showed the left PSA was stable.
Her bilateral serial pulse exams were stable and we monitored her groins.
A CXR showed bilateral effusions and she had no evidence of infiltrate on imaging (with no cough or URI symptoms).
We continued aggressive volume control with hemodialysis, provided oxygen supplementation with plan to wean, and maintained her on albuterol and ipratroprium nebs as needed with pulse oximetry monitoring and incentive spirometry.
# NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA - The patient presented with baseline chronic renal insufficiency-induced normocytic anemia with HCT in the 30-32% range with Epopoeitin injections monthly.
Upon MICU transfer she required 5 units of packed red cells during for a HCT of 24-25% which responded appropriately.
The patient's hematocrit was trended closely and our transfusion goal was to a HCT > 26% given her significant CAD.
# HYPERTENSION - The patient was continued on her home blood pressure regimen; with a goal BP < 130/80 mmHg.
Calcium 600 + D(3) 600 mg(1,500mg) -400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
