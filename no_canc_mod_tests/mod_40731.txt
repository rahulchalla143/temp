There was some discrepancy between CTA and carotid dupplex regarding severity of stenosis but both studies referred to it as "high grade".
Stenting was done successfully today and pt is coming to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring s/p CEA as surgery immediately next to carotid sinus and concern that might be temporarily affected post-op.

Due to fact that R carotid stent was placed near the carotid body, there was concern that pt might have labile BP post-op and he was admitted to CCU for close monitoring and possible nitro or dobutamine drips.
At time of arrival to unit, BP in 110-120s without aid of medications.
Pt also on oral iron and with no Hx of GI bleed, no bright red blood, and no past EGD so black stool most likely [**2-8**] to iron supplements.
Baseline Hct in Atrius records form [**3-17**] showed Hct 38, down to 33 on day of admission and 27 the following afternoon.
Hct trended for 24hrs and stayed stable around 27.
