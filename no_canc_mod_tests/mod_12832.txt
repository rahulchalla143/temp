She was subsequently sent to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.
During the examination she had no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
Blood pressure 148/54 to 167/62.
Heart rate between 83 and 95.
Finger stick 109.
Cardiac catheterization revealed a 50% stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery and a 30% stenosis in the distal circumflex with diffusely diseased distal left anterior descending coronary artery.
MR imaging study of the head revealed a small diffusion signal increase in the right basal ganglia internal capsule area without flow distal to the take off of the right MCA from the ICA.
As part of a experimental study here at the [**Hospital1 69**] caused DIFUSE, she was given intravenous tissue plasminogen activator.
After the treatment a follow up MR imaging study revealed recannulization of the right MCA with distal flow.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 39648**] suffered what appears to be a post catheterization ischemic stroke.
However, what is clear is that a transesophageal echocardiogram done at the time of cardioversion revealed no evidence of atrial disease or thrombus present.
To evaluate for any changes post cardioversion and catheterization Mrs. [**Known lastname 39648**] is undergoing a surface cardiac echocardiogram today the results of which are still pending.
Depending upon the results of this cardiac echocardiogram we may consider anticoagulation although in the absence of any evidence of thrombus formation it is unlikely that anticoagulation is of any benefit.
She should also follow up with Stroke Neurology Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1399**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 39652**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1694**].
OUTSTANDING STUDIES:  Cardiac echocardiogram is still pending at the time of this dictation, but we expect the results will be available before discharge and any changes in medication will be noted.
