This is a 74 year old male with PMH significant for HTN, CAD, diastolic dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension with an estimated PASP of 41 mm Hg on last ECHO in [**4-4**], OA, hyperlipidemia, DM2, who was admitted to the MICU post-operatively while still intubated and sedated for hemodynamic monitoring following a left THA revision complicated by a large amount of blood loss and hemodynamic instability requiring two pressors.
He was also on Levophed and phenylephrine to maintain his blood pressures.
There was concern for CVA or neurogenic shock as his blood pressures have varied widely from 80s-180s systolic, he is bradycardic, however CTA head was negative.
He was also noted to have ST elevations on EKG likely in setting of demand ischemia related to hypotension and blood loss in setting of CAD.
POD 4 - Hct 26.9 -> Transfused 1 unit PRBCs  Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.
Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted accordingly.
The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen.
