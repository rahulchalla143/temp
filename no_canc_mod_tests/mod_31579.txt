He had small bilateral pleural effusions on CXR but never required drainage and his repiratory status was stable.
An NGT was placed and the patient was started on TPN for nutrition.
His KUB continued to show some distention, however his ostomy output remained within normal limits and the patient was asymptomatic.
Gastric distention was voerall improved and his abdomen was soft.
As documented on his discharge paper work, should he have any fevers or continued symptoms we would recommend a repeat urinalysis and urine culture.
