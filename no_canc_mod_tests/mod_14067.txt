He has a history of a positive stress test and recently underwent cardiac catheterization which showed right dominant coronary circulation with a 70% stenosis in the diagonal artery with 90% lesion in the mid right coronary artery.
Left ventriculography revealed a preserved ejection fraction and very calcified aortic valve with reduced mobility.
There was severe aortic stenosis with aortic valve gradient of 57 mmHg and valve area of 0.6 cm2.
A recent chest CT scanz([**2182-4-19**]) found dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta.
Outside ECHO in [**2182-2-10**] showed [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.8 cm2 with a mean gradient of 43 mmHg.
Of note, the CT scan in [**2182-4-10**] was also notable for a focal abdominal aortic dissection at the level of the renal arteries extending over approximately 3.5 cm.
Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 130/69, HR 67, RR 22, SAT  97% on room air General: well developed male in no acute distress HEENT: oropharynx benign, edentulous, MMM, PERRL Neck: supple, no JVD, transmitted murmur vs bruit noted bilaterally Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, harsh SEM noted Lungs: clear bilaterally Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds Ext: warm, no edema, no varicosities Pulses: 2+ distally Neuro: nonfocal   Pertinent Results: [**2182-4-17**] Carotid Ultrasound: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
[**2182-4-19**] Chest, Abd, Pelvic CT Scan: 1.
[**2182-4-11**] Cardiac Cath: 1.Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with one vessel coronary artery disease.
Left ventriculography revealed a preserved ejection fraction and very calcified aortic valve with reduced mobility.
Hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures and normal left sided filling pressures with mild pulmonary hypertension.
There was severe aortic stenosis with Ao valve gradient of 57 mmHg and valve area of 0.6 cm2.

At discharge, his BP was 120-130/60-70 with a HR of 80.
His oxygen saturation was 95% on room air and the discharge chest x-ray showed only small bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
