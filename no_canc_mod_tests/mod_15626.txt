However, he continued to experience substernal chest pain, which had radiated to his neck and arms after walking approximately 100 to 150 steps.
He underwent an ETT on [**10-12**] where he exercised for 7.5 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol with ST depressions along with MIBI showing moderate to severe perfusion defects in the distal anterior wall and apex.
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization to the [**Hospital1 69**].
History of HIV with last CD4 count of 15 in [**11-12**].
Heart rate 93.
Blood pressure 107/52.
Respirations 22.
Sating 100% on room air.
Sensation to light touch intact in all four extremities.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  The patient's white blood cell count was 3.1, hematocrit 27.1, hemoglobin 9.0, platelets 95.
INR 1.0, PTT 38.8, PT 12.4.
Urinalysis had a specific gravity of greater then 1.035 with negative nitrate and negative leukocyte esterase.
Chem 7 sodium was 133, potassium 3.3, chloride 103, bicarb 22, creatinine 0.7, BUN 17, glucose 163, cholesterol 145, triglycerides of 180, HDL 29 and LDL of 80.
The patient initially underwent a cardiac catheterization, which was notable for the left main with no significant obstructive coronary artery disease.
The initial hemodynamics revealed normal filling pressures and a calculated ejection fraction of 65%.
The patient on the following day had undergone interventional cardiac catheterization where he underwent drug eluding stent placement in the circumflex and left anterior descending coronary artery.
This catheterization was notable for 20% distal stenosis in the left main.
However, during this procedure the patient had dropped his blood pressure to the 70s initially.
He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further hemodynamic monitoring.
The patient's baseline blood pressures had been in the 90s.
His other white blood cells and platelets were at his baseline values.
Status post cardiac catheterization with intervention to the circumflex and left anterior descending coronary artery with stent placement.
