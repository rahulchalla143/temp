[**2178-9-29**] GI bleeding study IMPRESSION: No bleeding site identified.
Hematocrit on admission was 33.3% and was monitored every 8 hours.
His coagulopathy was reversed with FFP and Vitamin K. Colonoscopy on HD#2 revealed a large amount of old & new blood throughout the colon.
Tagged RBC bleeding scan on HD#2 was negative for a source of bleeding.
Repeat colonoscopy on HD#4 revealed diverticulosis but no active bleeding.
Because of a large amount of cecal blood seen on the second colonoscopy, an upper GI series/small bowel follow-through was performed on HD#5, which was unremarkable.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable HD#[**2-28**] and he did not require any more transfusions.
Vancomycin was discontinued on HD#5 as these skin changes were felt to be more consistent with chronic lymphedema.
# AFib - The patient was monitored on telemetry.
Electrolytes were monitored daily and repleted as needed.
