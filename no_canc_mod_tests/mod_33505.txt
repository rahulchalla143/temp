TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis with no IV or oral contrast administration.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The visualized portion of the lung bases demonstrates panlobular emphysema.
CT of the pelvis with no contrast: The urinary bladder has normal appearance.
In this setting of renal failure and numerous cysts, the differential diagnosis favors hemorrhagic (or superinfected) cysts, or less likely, primary renal malignancy.
COMMENT: Please note that son[**Name (NI) 867**] may be helpful for further evaluation of hyperdense renal cysts, prostate gland with hemorrhage and bladder PVR, and evaluation of the liver lesion.
=============================================================== Stress-MIBI:INTERPRETATION: This 86 year old man with a history of renal failure and CAD was referred to the lab for evaluation of chest pain.
PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2161-2-11**]  PERSANTINE MIBI  Reason: 86 YEAR OLD MAN WITH HYPERTENSION, NEWLY DEPRESSED EF, INFER OLATERAL HYPOKINESIS  RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA: 10.9 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2161-2-11**]); 33.0 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2161-2-11**]); HISTORY: 86-year-old man with a hsitory of HTN referred for evaluation of a newly discovered cardiomyopathy with depressed systolic function and a wall motion abnormality on echocardiography  SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:  Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 mg/kg/min.
METHOD:  Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
Stress images were obtained approximately 45 minutes following tracer injection.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 27% with an EDV of 107 ml.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
================================================ US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2161-2-5**] 9:14 AM  US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN; RENAL U.S.  Reason: evaluate hyperdensities seen on CT scan (kidney and liver) f  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 86 year old man with acute renal failure, urinary retention, hyperkalemia.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate hyperdensities seen on CT scan (kidney and liver) for cyst versus malignancy.
INDICATION: 86-year-old male with acute renal failure and multiple hyperdense cysts seen on recent CT examination.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis dated [**2161-2-4**].
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormalities.
The 8-mm hypodense lesion seen on the recent CT scan is not clearly visualized.
The pancreas and midline retroperitoneal structures are obscured by overlying bowel gas.
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 9.4 cm and the left kidney measures 7.5 cm in length.
Hypodense lesion in the hepatic dome seen on the recent CT is not clearly visualized.
CKD stage IV:--elevated creatinine determined to be consistent with chronic baseline.
Echo demonstrated Ef o 40% with focal wall motion abnormalities.
BP 130's to 150's on this regimen by discharge.
U/S showed lesions were likely hemmorhagic cysts.
