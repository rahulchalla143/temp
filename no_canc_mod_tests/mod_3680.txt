Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Her vitals at time of transfer were T 98, BP 125/26, RR 32, sat 100% on BiPAP.
An EKG showed no ischemic changes and CXR showed no clear infiltrate (by my read).
Urine output per [**Hospital1 **] records was 200 cc since arrival in the ED.
Her vitals at time of transfer were BP 151/60, HR 87, satting 96% 2L, RR 16.
She was tried on various meds to control her blood pressure and reduce her afterload, including a nitroglycerine drip, a nitroprusside drip, and IV hydralazine.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2149-4-30**]): 2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2149-5-3**]):    NO GROWTH  Imaging Studies:  EKG ([**2149-4-28**]): Sinus rhythm.
CXR ([**2149-4-28**]): FINDINGS: Single semi-upright portable view of the chest was obtained.
Renal transplant ultrasound ([**2149-4-29**]): FINDINGS: Multiple transverse and longitudinal son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the renal transplant were obtained.
AP and lateral views of the left ankle are limited by bedside technique and cast.
Appearance is little changed from similar exam [**2149-4-7**].
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower.
EKG was unremarkable for ischemic changes and cardiac enzymes were normal.
CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia or infiltrate.
She underwent repeat transthoracic [**Month/Year (2) 461**] that showed severe MR although no significant change from prior.
Her preoperative work-up is nearly complete, although she will need cardiac catheterization prior to surgery.
Additionally, she will need repeat bone biopsy (see below) to confirm that the left ankle infection has been properly treated.
Her blood sugars were difficult to control initially so the [**Last Name (un) **] service was consulted to help manage her diabetes.
Infectious disease recommended continuing her vancomycin through [**5-2**] to complete a 6-week course, at which point they recommended to stop both vancomycin and Bactrim.
In one to two weeks, she should have a repeat bone biopsy off of all antibiotics to ensure that the infection has been appropriately treated.
Her EKG showed no evidence of ischemic changes.
Electrolytes were repleted for a potassium of less than 4.0 and magnesium of less than 2.0.
Her creatinine was noted to be at the recent baseline.
Diabetic, heart-healthy, low-sodium diet.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: Seventeen (17) grams PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

Discharge weight is 52.8kg (bed scale).
You had a bone biopsy while you were here that showed no evidence of infection.
The infectious disease doctors think that we can't know for sure if there is infection unless you have a biopsy performed while not on antibiotics.
***Someone from the ortho office will call you on Monday to set up a time for your biopsy in one week.
