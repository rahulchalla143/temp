Microbiology: BCx - negative UCx - mixed flora Stool Cx - negative for O&P.
CXR on admission:  .IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes.
CXR [**2136-6-15**] : IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**2136-6-14**]: .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
CTA chest [**6-16**]: .
CT abdomen/pelvis: [**2136-6-18**] .
EGD [**2136-6-21**]: .
Colonoscopy [**2136-6-21**]: .
Diverticulosis of the rectum, Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: 60-year-old woman with DM2, HTN, HL p/w dyspnea on exertion, right shoulder pain, and Hct 13, now know to be due to severe Fe defficiency anemia, etiology under investigation, whose course was c/b PEA arrest of unclear etiology, and patient found to have a DVT, with CTA negative for PE.
Patient had undergone CT of abdomen/pelvis in search of a possible malignancy leading to the anemia, which was negative for gross abnormality to account for the anemia.
Finally patient had undergone an EGD and Colonoscopy (see below for results).
# Anemia: Admission Hct 13 and MCV 53, Fe/Tf were very low, with high TIBC and impaired retic count, all consistent with Fe deficiency aneamia.
HCT ipmroved s/p 5U PRBCs, HCT ranged 26 - 29.
Given anemia and DVT (see below), she underwent a CT abdomen/pelvis in search of cancer source.
CT chest showed one 4mm nodule in the RML.
Patient finally underwent an EGD which showed minimal erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis, otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.
Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis of the rectum, otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
Her Hb electrophoresis was pending at time of discharge.
She had a stable O2 sat and on ECHO was noted to have EF 65%, LVH, and 2+MR and 2+TR as well as pulmonary hypertension (50-60mmHg).
With this treatment, her DOE improved significantly, RR decreased from 30s on admission to 18 and she remained free of oxygen requirement after transfer from the MICU.
She will require outpatient evaluation for pulmonary hypertension (OSA evaluation and possibly a R heart catheterization based on initial studies).
Her prior Colonoscopy in [**2133**] was negative.
See above for EGD and Colonoscopy results.
[**Name2 (NI) **] was in junctional rhythm and bradycardic, w/o a palpable pulse at time of assessment with heart rate in 40s.
Her blood cultures were negative at time of discharge.
Given hx of anemia, plus the appearance of her bladder on CT scan, she will require outpatient evaluation with cystoscopy.
