A CXR showed completed left lung collapse.
She subsequently became hypotensive with BP to 69/49 and was started on phenylephrine at 2:30pm with 500cc IVF fluid bolus x 2 given.

ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
URINE CULTURE [**2175-10-5**] no growth BLOOD CULTURE [**10-6**] and [**10-7**] No growth  CTA CHEST [**2175-10-6**] 1.
The lesions have already been investigated with MRI and bone scan and were negative on bone scan.
CXR [**2175-7-8**]: 1.
In order to guide further intervention of her left mainstem occlusion, she had a CTA to define the pulmonary and tracheobronchial architecture.
She went back to the OR for repeat rigid bronchoscopy no stent placed, but had therapeutic aspiration of secretions and debridement of scar tissue with recannalisation of left upper and lower lobe segments.
She had a known pneumonia, blood and urine cultures were also sent to evaluate for infection.
She received stress dose steroids and her blood pressures improved with weaning off of pressors.
CT chest showed multiple areas of consolidation and bronchiolar opacities.
BP normalized after antibiotics and stress dose steroids and WBC trended down.
Patient's O2 saturation remained stable afterwards and her O2 demanded continued to trend towards baseline.
She tends to mucus plug and needs aggressive chest PT, incentive spirometry.
CTA [**10-6**] showed a small pulmonary emboli are at subsegmental level in right lower lobe.
During her MICU stay she became bradycardic and was found on EKG to have a QTC in the 500s.
Cardiac enzymes remained flat and serial ekgs normalized.
#Lower extremity edema: no hx CHF with EF [**2174**] 60-65%, mild pulmonary artery HTN Lasix held in MICU and restarted on the floor.
PENDING TESTS ON DISCHARGE: -ESR AND CRP  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -followup with rheum to decide further immunosuppression due to recurrent airway closure from granulation tissue from wegeners -completion of anitbiotics levaquin and flagyl [**10-20**] -acyclovir for 5d ending [**10-17**] -aggressive nebs and incentive spirometry.

You were admitted after a rigid bronchoscopy procedure for respiratory and blood pressure support in the ICU.
During the course of your stay you had to have 2 rigid bronchoscopy procedures to open your airways.
Your breathing, white blood cell count, and blood pressure all improved after antibiotics.
