A CT scan done in the ED showed Occlusive thrombus at the proximal-to-mid portion of his the left vein bypass [**Month/Year (2) **].
On HD2 his foot exam remained stable, with palor, but good sensory and motor function.
Given his previous [**Month/Year (2) **] occlusions, the [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] team felt he was a poor candidate for repeat angiogram with angioplasty or stenting.
His previous angio studies were reviewed and it was determined that at this time, endovascular intervention is not an option.
On [**6-21**] he had no pain, and his foot exam was again stable - with a cool, somewhat pallored left foot, with good sensory-motor function.
His INR was 1.3 on [**6-21**], his heparin gtt was stopped and he was started on therpeutic once daily lovenox injections.
His INR is followed by his pcp [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
PT/INR lab test should be followed by your regular physician.
Please check INR friday [**6-23**].
Pt should continue lovenox injections until INR is 2.0 or greater   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Left lower extremity ischemia - Occlusive thrombus at the proximal-to-mid portion of the left arterial bypass [**Hospital **]   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
