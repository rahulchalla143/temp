The Y-shaped stent was removed and granulation tissue debrided from the left mainstem bronchus.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-10-29**], the multivalvular regurgitation is now seen and there now appears to be lack of atrial systolic function.
CT a/p [**4-27**] 1.
Nonspecific renal hypodensities might represent cysts though ultrasound evaluation is suggested for further characterization when clinically appropriate.

FURTHER WORKUP ON REQUEST ONLY.
sensitivity testing performed by Microscan.
Septic Shock/ventilator associated pneumonia - While in the ICU for monitoring after his Y-stent placement, Mr. [**Known lastname 34384**] developed worsening pulmonary secretions and chest x-ray was concerning for pneumonia/VAP.
He was aggressively resuscitated with 9L IVF with improvement in blood pressure.
Repeat sputum culture grew Pseudomonas, Klebsiella and stenotrophomonos.
Hematachezia - On hospital day 4, Mr. [**Known lastname 34384**] was found to have hematachezia.
His hematocrit was stable.
CT abdomen and pelvis showed no obstruction, concern for proctitis.
He had a flexible sigmoidoscopy which showed resolving proctitis, perhaps secondary to ischemia.
C. diff swab was negative x 3.
Symptoms were most likely [**2-25**] proctitis and associated ileus.
History of C. Diff - Recent diarrhea at reheab, C. difficile culture negative per report in rehab paperwork, remaining bacterial stool studies cancelled.
After worsening abdominal symptoms, he was started on IV Flagyl as well.
Remained C. Diff negative throughout admission.
Most recent echocardiogram in our system is from [**2117**], with preserved systolic function and LVEF of 75%.
Medications on Admission: - Albuterol/ipratropium inhaler 8 puff Q6H - Chlorhexidine 5 ml TID swish & spit - Nystatin 5 mL [**Hospital1 **] swish & spit - Phenobarbital 240 mg G-tube QHS - Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO QHS - Vancomycin 125 mg PO QID - Acetaminophen 650 mg G-tube Q6H for pain or fever - Bisacodyl 5 mg PO daily PRN constipation - Senna 8.6 mg PO QHS PRN constipation - Bacitracin topical ointment apply daily  Discharge Medications: 1. vancomycin 125 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours): Continue for 2 weeks after completion of antibiotics.
Surgery and Gastroenterology evaluated you and CT scan of your abdomen showed Proctitis (inflammation of the very distal bowel).
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
