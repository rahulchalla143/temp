Admission Date:  [**2127-5-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2127-5-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2127-5-18**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEONATOLOG HISTORY:   Baby Girl [**Known lastname 42256**] was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit on the second day of life for evaluation and treatment of significant hyperbilirubinemia.
She was born on [**2127-5-18**], as a 3.09 kilogram product of a term gestation to a 34 year old gravida III, para II to III  Prenatal screens were complete and unremarkable except for group B Streptococcus positive status and blood type O positive antibody negative.
On day two of life, significant jaundice was noted; bilirubin was checked and was found to be 24.0.
The lungs were clear to auscultation without increased work of breathing.
Blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate remained normal.
Hematology - Initial complete blood count on day one of life revealed a white count of 11.0 with a hematocrit of 54.0, platelets 313,000, and differential of 58 neutrophils and 2 bands.
Repeat complete blood count on day two of life at the time of admission to the NICU revealed a hematocrit of 46.5 with a white count of 18.0 and platelets of 350,000.
Coombs typing revealed an infant blood type of B positive and Coombs positive; as mentioned above, mother's blood type was O positive.
Hematocrit was followed several times during admission and remained stable at 46.0; this was last checked on day four of life with a reticulocyte count of 7.0%.
Hyperbilirubinemia was responsive to this therapy and bilirubin level decreased to 18.0 by the morning after admission and then to 15.0.
Liver function tests were measured and found to be within normal limits.
At that time, bilirubin level was 12.9/0.4.
Bilirubin level twelve hours later was 11.9 and bilirubin level 24 hours after discontinuation of phototherapy was 12.7/0.4.
On screening laboratories on day two to three of life, a metabolic acidosis was noted with initial electrolytes revealing a bicarbonate of 16 and anion gap of 19.
Repeat electrolytes shortly after reinitiation of feedings revealed a bicarbonate of 10 with an anion gap of 23.
Subsequent electrolytes revealed persistence of the metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate level of 12 and anion gap of 18.
An extensive metabolic workup was performed (see below) and in the interim bicarbonate replacement was begun with intravenous fluids of D10 water with 3 mEq of sodium bicarbonate of 1 mEq of potassium chloride per 100 ccs.
Electrolytes gradually improved and by day five of life, electrolytes revealed a sodium of 142, potassium 4.3, chloride of 107, bicarbonate 18.
Urine was negative for ketones throughout.
Electrolytes were followed closely and remained largely stable with bicarbonate values 18 to 21 and anion gap of 14 to 16.
Urine was checked often and remained negative for ketones throughout.
Electrolytes shortly prior to discharge on [**2127-5-27**], revealed a sodium of 138, potassium 5.8, chloride 107, bicarbonate 17.
Urine on the day of discharge was still negative for ketones.
Serum was sent for aminoacids and urine was sent for aminoacids and organic acids.
Ammonia level was checked and found to be 71; a follow-up ammonia level two days later was 100.
At the time of this dictation, the urine aminoacid screen from those samples has returned negative; the serum aminoacids and urine organic acids sent to Quest Laboratories are still pending.
Repeat samples were sent to the [**Hospital3 1810**] Laboratory on day four of life; these samples returned negative for serum aminoacids, urine organic acids and urine aminoacids.
On the day of discharge, repeat samples were sent to [**Hospital3 18242**] for serum aminoacids and urine organic acids.
Tests at the time of this dictation pending results include serum aminoacids from Quest Laboratories from a sample from [**2127-5-21**], urine organic acids from Quest Laboratories from a sample from [**2127-5-22**], and serum aminoacids and urine organic acids at [**Hospital3 1810**] from samples dated [**2127-5-27**].
Neurology - The patient has maintained a normal neurologic examination with an appropriate level of activity and responsiveness throughout admission.
Electrolytes remained largely stable as detailed above.
Rebound bilirubin level is acceptable at 12.7/0.4.
The infant will follow-up in one day with primary pediatrician, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1250**] for repeat electrolytes and bilirubin.
Follow-up appointment has also been made with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 40698**] of the [**Hospital3 1810**] Metabolic Service on [**2127-6-12**], at 9:30 a.m. in the [**Last Name (un) 9795**] Building, [**Location (un) **], of [**Hospital3 18242**], telephone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 42259**].
