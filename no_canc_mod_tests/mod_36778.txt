PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 101.8.
Pulse 107 and irregular.
Blood pressure 110/59.
Respirations 20.
Saturations 92%.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 11.9, hematocrit 28.7, platelets 313, PT 17, PTT 29.7, INR 2.0, sodium 146, potassium 5.3, chloride 116, CO2 22, BUN 38, creatinine 1.3, glucose 127, calcium 7.9, magnesium 1.5, phos 2.6, lipase 7, albumin 2.5, ALT 363, AST 593, alkaline phosphatase 193 and total bilirubin is 0.8, amylase is 91, lactate 3.0, troponin was 13.9, CPK 65.33 and MB was not done.
Urinalysis showed moderate leukocyte esterase, moderate blood, few bacteria, 3 to 5 red cells and 6 to 10 white blood cells.
Arterial blood gas was 7.34, 45, 188, 25, and negative 1.
CT of her head was unchanged showing a left parietal lobe infarct, unchanged right thalamic lacunar infarct.
CT of her abdomen showed bilateral pleural effusions.
The plan was to take the patient emergently to the Operating Room for exploratory laparotomy.
She was taken to the Operating Room and underwent exploratory laparotomy where a ischemic left colon was encountered.
Enalapril was attempted, however, blood pressure dropped so this was discontinued.
The HIP panel was sent, which ultimately returned negative.
Hematology recommended a Lepirudin drip, which was started on the [**11-22**].
Her Lepirudin was on at 3 mg per hour.
She had begun to show an upper trend in her fever curve to 100.8 for a temperature max.
This was due to a positive sputum culture three days prior, which was positive for MRSA.
The patient had cardiac enzymes sent, which were initially negative for an myocardial infarction.
Her cardiac index continued to be very marginal alone with marginal urine output.
An echocardiogram was obtained on postoperative day six.
A left femoral line, which was initially in place from transfer from the outside hospital and then discontinued after the patient was transferred from the Operating Room and cultures of this showed E-Coli.
Additionally she grew out yeast from her urine culture and was started on Fluconazole.
Additionally, she was started on a neo drip to support her blood pressure, which had been trending down.
Throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay her ostomy continued to be pink, viable and functioning.
A CAT scan was obtained to rule out further bowel ischemia and/or intraabdominal source of sepsis.
The CAT scan did show some ascites for which a diagnostic tap was obtained the results of which are pending at the time of this dictation.
The patient showed an upward trend in her white count as well.
Her index continued to be marginal and her urine output had slowly decreased throughout the night.
Her white count was 27.5.
Throughout the day the patient became oliguric and her blood pressure and cardiac index continued to decline despite the pressors previously mentioned.
