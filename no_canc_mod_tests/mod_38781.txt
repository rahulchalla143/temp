At the OSH she was found to be in multiorgan failure, with transaminitis in the 10,000s, INR 3.8, ammonia 540, creatinine 3.6, and lactate of 13.
Blood pressure was responsive to 4L of IV fluids with improvement to the 90's.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Her blood pressures remained low, as low as in the 70s, despite the 4L she was given at the OSH, was started on levophed.
Vital signs on transfer were: 74/50, 123, 24, 100%RA .
Dullness to percussion in flanks.

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis without contrast ([**2168-12-27**]): 1.
CT Brain Perfusion :  No large area of increased MTT or perfusion deficit in the imaged portions of the brain.
Evaluation of the imaged posterior fossa structures is limited due to artifacts.
The study is somewhat suboptimal due to slightly suboptimal quality of the perfusion maps for the posterior fossa.
EEG ([**2168-12-31**]): This EEG continues to show a moderately severe to severe diffuse encephalopathy although some of the frequencies now appear to be slightly faster suggesting there may be some reversibility.

EGD ([**2169-1-25**]): Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Mosaic appearance in the fundus, stomach body and antrum compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy.
# Fulminant Liver Failure - Patient with no known underlying liver disease except history of alcohol abuse presents with altered mental status and abnormal liver enzymes ALT 7780, AST [**Numeric Identifier 89939**], LDH 319, Alk Phos 117, TBili 3.7)  and elevated INR (peak of 8.9)suggestive of acute liver failure.
Hepatitis serologies and autoimmune work-up (including [**Doctor First Name **] and AMA) were negative.
A bolt was placed on [**2168-12-30**] and labs/mental status exams closely followed out of concern for cerebral edema.
Follow-up MRI did not show evidence of infarct or hemorrhage.
The length of her course suggested more profound underlying liver disease than was apparent on admission so liver biopsy was obtained, which was pending at the time of discharge and the hepatologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will follow up.
An EGD was performed that showed 2 cords of grade 1 esophageal varices.
Urine lytes consistent with prerenal etiology which could be any of the latter two.
Sputum cultures persistently showed yeast and she was treated with fluconazole from [**12-29**] to [**1-3**] and transitioned to micafungin from [**1-3**] to [**1-7**].
At the time of discharge she was breathing comfortably with excellent oxygen saturations on room air.
She was initially placed on a CIWA scale.
She showed no evidence of alcohol withdrawal or DT's and the CIWA scale was discontinued.
A CT Abdomen on [**12-27**] showed the pancreas to be diffusely enlarged with surrounding stranding consistent with pancreatitis, but no evidence of necrosis or pseudocyst.
Cell Count from the paracentesis showed 975 WBCs (70% PMNs).
Follow-up MRI did not show evidence of infarct or hemorrhage.
Her liver function tests (ALT/AST and Alk phos) improved significantly, however the bilirubin remains quite elevated.
