CXR:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette and slight widened mediastinum which could represent pericardial effusion and/or mediastinal hematoma, however AP projection makes for difficult comparison and enlargement could be attributed to projectional differences.

Given that he had an enlarged heart on CXR a bedside echo was initially done to rule out effusion, tamponade.
An EEG was obtained, and the neuro service was consulted.
