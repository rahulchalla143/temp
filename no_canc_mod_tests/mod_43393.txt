Hypodense foci in the thyroid, as described above, largest 1.5x0.6cm posterior to the isthmus, needs further evaluation with US on a non-emergent basis.
EKG: Sinus rhythm Low inferolateral lead T wave amplitude is nonspecific Since previous tracing of [**2187-6-10**], sinus tachycardia absent and ST-T wave changes decreased .
CT Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Known deep venous thrombus involving the left common iliac vein is not well seen on this non-contrast examination 3.
Incompletely characterized 18 x 16-mm right ovarian rounded lesion that if of clinical concern, a pelvic ultrasound can be performed for further characterization.
Her urine culture later revealed e.coli, and antibiotics were narrowed to pip/tazo.
On the medicine floor, this was later changed to cefpodoxime based upon culture sensitivities, with plans to complete a 14 day course.
# DKA: Patient was found to be in DKA at the time of admission with an anion gap of  21 and glucose of 420.
She was converted to lantus and sliding scale insulin after her anion gap closed and her glucose levels were well controlled.
Patient was transferred to the medicine floor, and her blood pressure remained stable.
CT head/neck, Xray foot and pelvis were negative for fracture (see reports for findings).
Serial EKGs and cycled troponins were done to rule out ACS.
Her cardiac enzymes showed TrpT of 0.03, but CK-MB remained negative.
Her sodium was monitored and reached a maximum of 148, but then normalized and remained stable.
Her HR remained well controlled, and pt did not become hypertensive.
Please resume if HR or BP become elevated.
