Mr.  [**Known lastname 12585**] also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy; a cervical MRI scan showed very impressive disc herniations at C5-C6, less so at C4-C5, with clear cut cord compression, particularly on the right side C5-C6.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Postoperative physical examination demonstrated that he was afebrile at 97 degrees; blood pressure 145/80; pulse 60; respiratory rate 10; 100% on a non-rebreather.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the PACU, Anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his SAO2 dropped to 89%.
His respiratory rate was 30 on face mask.
Interoperatively, he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate, although requiring some neo-synephrine interoperatively.
He responded to intravenous Lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement.
No definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia, although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction.
On the day of transfer, the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] sensorium; thus, a delirium work-up was initiated looking for precipitants.
When his O2 saturation was monitored, his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay.
In addition, his cyclosporin levels were checked.
Finger sticks were in the 150s when acutely agitated, therefore, it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory.
He was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to 101.0 F.; yet, chest x-ray, blood cultures, urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources.
A lumbar puncture was considered, although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure.
Mass effect was considered, although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium, it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality.
A head and neck CT scan, non-contrast, were ordered though to evaluate for such processes.
Liver function tests were checked, only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6.
TSH was within normal limits as was B12 and folate.
RPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked.
An EEG was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus, although again this did not seem to be a likely cause.
His immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4; he has a baseline renal insufficiency.
With this in mind, when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option.
He was also discharged home with [**Hospital6 1587**] for Physical Therapy evaluation of home safety.
Creatinine 2.2 to 2.5.
Right coronary artery stent in [**2133**]; ejection fraction 60 to 65%.
