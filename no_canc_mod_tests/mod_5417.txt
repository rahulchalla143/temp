Cath revealed severely elevated biventricular filling pressures, as well as severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with only moderate elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance.
PCWP was 38, PASP was 96.
An ABG revealed a respiratory acidosis: 7.23/70/73/31.
He had been started on a nitro gtt in the cath lab after SBPs noted to be elevated to 200s, and after arrival in CCU his nitro gtt was titrated to keep SBP <160.

Reports: TTE [**2133-7-7**] This study was compared to the prior study of [**2132-10-2**].
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-10-2**], there is no definite change.
[**2133-7-6**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**6-8**], the patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration.
EKG [**2133-7-8**]: Sinus rhythm and atrial ectopy, atrial bigeminy.
The atrial ectopy is new as compared with previous tracing of [**2133-7-6**].

Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart filling pressures with RVEDP 24 mmHg and PCWP 38 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.9 L/min/m2.
# Acute on chronic respiratory acidosis - After cardiac cath, patient noted to be lethargic, and ABG revealed pH 7.23, pCO2 70.
This acid-base disturbance was thought to be an acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, most likely due to increased sedation in setting of cardiac cath with underlying obesity hypoventilation syndrome and pulmonary HTN.
Respiratory therapy was consulted, and the patient was placed on BiPAP overnight.
Repeat ABGs showed a persistent acidosis, with mild improvement in hypercapnia following BiPAP.
Repeat ABGs revealed a similar respiratory acidosis profile despite therapy, but he improved clinically.
#) Pulmonary HTN - Patient noted to have severe pulmonary HTN during cardiac cath, which was likely contributing to his dyspnea.
Outpatient pulmonary work-up revealed severe restrictive pulmonary dysfunction with reduced lung volumes, but normal DLCO when calculated for lung volumes, suggesting pulmonary HTN not related to a primarily pulmonary vascular etiology.
A TTE was performed on [**2133-7-7**], but given suboptimal image quality, was unable to better characterize pulmonary artery systolic pressures.
A pulmonary consult was called, and the team felt the patient would not be an ideal candidate for a vasodilator challenge at this time, but that the issue could be re-addressed once the patient had undergone diuresis for his diastolic heart failure exacerbation.
Ultimately, the patient would benefit most from lifestyle changes including weight loss, smoking cessation, and increased physical activity, and he is aware of these recommendations.
Could consider autoimmune work-up and evaluation for neuromuscular disease (note normal CK 71), however dCHF and OSA are most likely etiologies of his pulmonary HTN.
# Diastolic Heart Failure -  Biventricular elevated filling pressures demonstrated on cardiac cath c/w diastolic heart failure.
Echo obtained [**9-/2132**] demonstrated normal ventricular systolic function with LVEF>55%, and moderate pulmonary HTN.
Repeat echo this admission again revealed LVEF >55%, RV free wall hypertrophy, and increased LV filling pressures, but could not compare pulmonary artery systolic pressures to previous studies given suboptimal image quality of echo.
His fluid balance was difficult to monitor, as the patient refused a Foley catheter and was frequently incontinent.
Daily weights were monitored, and repeat CXR showed improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.
His respiratory status had improved prior to discharge, and his weight was down 4.8kg since admission (discharge weight 130kg).
Urine electrolytes obtained, and were consistent with a pre-renal etiology.
Liver team did not feel cyclosporine toxicity was responsible for the acute rise in Cr, however his cyclosporine dose was decreased and his levels were monitored.
His Cr and electrolytes were closely monitored, and electrolytes were repleted as necessary.
His Cr on discharge was 2.8 and decreasing, and will be further monitored in the outpatient setting.
#  s/p Liver Transplant: He was continued on cyclosporine, although the dose was decreased from twice daily dosing to once daily dosing after cyclosporine level noted to be elevated.
The liver team recommended checking daily LFTs and INR to monitor his graft function.

The catheterization revealed high pressures in both sides of the heart and severe pulmonary hypertension (see explanation below).
Following your catheterization you were admitted to the CCU as you were having difficulty breathing, and you were put on the BiPAP machine to help your breathing.
We carefully monitored your kidney function with regular blood tests, and it was improving at the time you were discharged.
You were also drowsy and at times disoriented, and we felt that this was because your oxygen levels were low and your carbon dioxide levels were high.
On [**2133-7-10**] you had an episode of worsening shortness of breath, but your chest X-ray showed improvement and there were no abnormalities on the heart tracing (ECG).
