TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial and coronal images obtained following gadolinium.
FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
At the left infratemporal region, an irregular area of T1 and T2 hyperintensity identified which appears to be fat within the skull base bones.
IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities detected on MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium.
Seen at [**Location (un) 47**], CT head neg, LP with Tube 1: 18,000 RBC, Tube 4 with 34,000 RBC.
TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the head were obtained before contrast.
Following this, contrast-enhanced CT angiography of the head was obtained using departmental protocol.
FINDINGS HEAD CT:  Head CT demonstrates normal ventricles and extraaxial spaces without midline shift, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or hemorrhage.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD:  CT angiography of the head demonstrates normal appearances of the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.

At the left infratemporal region, an irregular area of T1 and T2 hyperintensity identified which appears to be fat within the skull base bones.
MR of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine w/ and without contrast on [**2155-9-15**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
Portable CXR [**2155-9-16**]: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or any other major cardiovascular abnormality on single-view chest examination with patient in semi-erect position.
Tagged WBC scan [**2155-9-19**]: Normal   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was originally admitted to the Neurosurgery service for management of a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Neither subarachnoid blood nor a vascular anomaly was not seen on the MRI imaging of the entire neuroaxis.
The official read of the C-spine MRI suggested a retropharyngeal phlegmon.
The infectious disease service was consulted and a recommended tagged white blood cell scan that was normal.
