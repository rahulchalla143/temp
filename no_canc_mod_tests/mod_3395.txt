Embolization Report: HT RENAL ANGIOGRAM AND GELFOAM EMBOLIZATION, FOLLOWED BY TEMPORARY HEMODIALYSIS CATHETER PLACEMENT  INDICATION: 71-year-old woman with right renal arterial bleeding, status post right renal arterial stent.
Patient was placed supine on the imaging table in the interventional suite.
A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle and into the axillary artery.
Arteriogram was performed in two projections.
Firm pressure was applied at the arteriotomy site for about 25 minutes to achieve complete hemostasis.
After appropriate measurements, removal of the microsheath and sequential tract dilatation with 12- and 14-French dilators under fluoroscopy, 14 French 15 cm hemodialysis catheter was placed.
Multiple angiograms performed from the right main renal artery, and from the caudal branch of interpolar artery, caudal branch of right renal lower polar artery and subsequently a peripheral branch (fourth order) branch of the cranial branch of interpolar artery demonstrated multiple foci of active extravasation (corresponding to those seen on CT dated [**2172-3-31**]), and two possible foci of contained extravasation or pseudoaneurysms.
Post-embolization arteriograms demonstrated good angiographic results in their appropriate territories, no significant residual extravasation, and contrast enhancement of approximately 70% of the right kidney on the final angiogram.
Post-intervention angiography demonstrated brisk flow into the visualized portion of the SMA.
Right renal angiography demonstrated multiple foci of active extravasation, followed by successful targeted Gelfoam embolization of distal branches of right renal interpolar and lower pole arteries.
The hypotension (to systolic BPs in the 40s) was accompanied by back pain, and given concern for a retroperitoneal/perinephric bleed a massive transfusion protocol was initiated.
A stat hematocrit returned at 22 (down from 32 on admission).
ACT was 150, and 10 of protamine was given.
She was initially hemodynamically stable on dopamine, and a CT abdomen/pelvis was obtained which demonstrated a large perinephric hematoma with extension into the mesentery and retroperitoneum.
While in the CCU, she remained hemodynamically stable from 9pm until approximately 12am when her pressures began to decrease, pressors were restarted, and her lactates began to rise from 5 following embolization to 7 at 3am.
A stat echo was obtained which demonstrated normal LV systolic dysfunction and a patent IVC, making cardiogenic shock and abdominal compartment sydnrome less likely.
Serial hematocrits were stable in the 30s.
Given her rising lactate, worsening acidosis, persistently distended abdomen, and high bladder pressures in the 20s an exploratory laparotomy at 7am was undertaken to evaluate possible abdominal compartment syndrome versus bowel ischemia.
sBP were in 60s for a long time.
