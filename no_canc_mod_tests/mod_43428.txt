The following day she demonstrated markedly diminished mental status and a head CT scan per Radiology revealed scattered hypodense foci in the right frontal lobe and left frontal and temporal lobes are indeterminate but may represent small vessel ischemic changes/volume averaging.
Ultimately her mental status improved, her urine output was adequate with resolving postoperative ARF.
She continued to slowly progress and on POD# 12 she was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
