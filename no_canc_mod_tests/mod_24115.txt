Tmax was 101.7.
A CT head showed frontal parietal lesion, concerning for a mass.
CXR was concerning for fluid overload vs. pneumonia.
Labs were notable for negative tox screen, BNP 705, WBC 23.5, Hct 36.5, 11 bands.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED a head CT was repeated.
An LP was performed.
which had 1 WBC, protein 28, glucose 97, 86% lymphs, 15% monos.
Initial lactate was 3.5 which trended down to 1.8 after 4 L IVF.
An initial u/a showed positive nitrites.

Imaging/diagnostics: - CT head ([**2171-6-5**]): Left frontal cortically based lesion, as detailed above.
Diagnostic considerations include a low grade neoplasm, a subacute infarct, encephalitis or another inflammatory process (though location is atypical), and tumefactive demyelination (such as MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
MRI with and without contrast is recommended.
- MRA/MRV brain ([**2171-6-5**]): 1.
There is extensive paranasal sinus disease with air-fluid levels within the ethmoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
The MRA of the head demonstrates complete loss of flow signal within the left ICA with collateral flow to the supraclinoid left ICA, MCA and ACA, which is less in flow intensity compared with the contralateral side, which is likely an result of contralateral collateral flow.
- CTA head/neck ([**2171-6-6**]): 1.
Diminished flow-related enhancement of the left V3 vertebral segment as seen on the CT study.
- CT head ([**2171-6-8**]): 1.
- CT head ([**2171-6-11**]): 1.
Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by mediastinal vascular widening.
The latter has progressed since the previous study of earlier the same date, and is accompanied by worsening perihilar and basilar airspace opacities.
- Echocardiogram ([**2171-6-5**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal (spetal thinning from infarct).
CXR [**6-15**]-FINDINGS: Radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained forassessment of nasogastric tube.
Cardiac silhouette remainsmarkedly enlarged and is accompanied by mild pulmonary edema and small pleuraleffusions.
CXR [**6-21**]- Extensive bilateral opacification of the lungs is unchanged , most likely consistent with pulmonary edema.
Neurology was consulted for evaluation of the CT head finding and MRI confirmed L MCA territory infarct.
The patient underwent extensive imaging including MRA/MRV of the head and neck, CTA of the neck, and repeated CT head to track interval progression of cerebral edema.
INR is 1.9.
INR should be rechecked daily and heparin can be disontinued when INR is [**1-31**].
Ongoing INR monitoring and coumadin dose changes will be required.
Initial CXR showed significant fluid overload and possible pneumonia (see above).
She maintained good oxygen saturations on room air through the latter portion of her hospital course.
Initial echocardiogram was suggestive of stress-mediated/Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy with apical hypokinesis.
She had a repeat echo with persistent apical akinesis an EF of 25-30%.
She should have a repeat echocardiogram in 2 months to re-evaluate her cardiac function.
Consideration was made for cardiac catheterization but there was not felt to be a definitive indication in this high risk patient.
Acute renal failure: Patient had transient acute renal failure with Cr 1.2 compared to baseline of 0.9 from over-diuresis.
She should have a repeat speech and swallow evaluation at Rehab as necessary.
She requires ongoing monitoring of electrolytes while on tubefeeds.
Heparin drip Continue heparin drip at 1750 units per hour with PTT monitoring and dosing changes per protocol.
This may be discontinued when daily INR is [**1-31**].
When at goal of [**1-31**], turn off upon the results of INR monitoring.
You will continue taking coumadin daily and continue on a heparin drip until your INR is between [**1-31**].
You should have daily INR and PTT checks while on the heparin and coumadin until a doctor determines that the frequency of these blood tests can be reduced.
