There is likely sphincter dysfunction or papillary stenosis, but if labs show a cholestatic picture further evaluation with MRCP would be recommended.
CXR ([**2170-11-9**])- AP upright and lateral views of the chest are obtained.
Not accompanied by subjective abdominal pain, diarrhea, cramping, or f/c, but patient was tender on exam.
Patient was evaluated by GI who recommended starting moviprep for possible colonoscopy and CT scan to evaluate for ischemic colitis.
She was started on cipro/flagyl due to concern for diverticulitis; however, antibiotics were discontinued when the CT scan suggested that the inflammatory changes were more chronic.
Patient's HCT dropped from 31 on admission to 25.
She received 2 units of pRBCs and her HCT increased appropriately and remained stable (31.9-34.3) upon discharge.
========================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ========================== # Cystic lesion of pancreas - likley IMPN, can get outpatient work-up # Mild pulmonary fibrosis - patient is not reporting any respiratory complaints, can also get outpatient work-up.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because you were experiencing a GI bleeding and there were concerns regarding your blood pressure.
You were observed in our medical intensive care unit and your blood pressures remained stable.
You later underwent a sigmoidoscopy which did not show any additional bleeding, but it also did not reveal its original source.
The pain/bleeding may have been due to a lack of blood flow to the colon, but this process seems to have resolved.
