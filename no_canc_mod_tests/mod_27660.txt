Workup of the fever revealed severe RLL as well as large, loculated R pl.
Admission ABG on [**2123-12-12**] was 7.13/>115/64 on [**1-5**] of BiPAP.
A triple lumen R-IJ was placed on [**2123-12-14**] in the setting of hypotension: she reportedly had SBP into the 80s & required pressors for a short period--dopamine initially (which made her tachycardic) then vasopressin.
ABG on [**2123-12-21**] was 7.36/83/78 on AC [**1-5**], TV 450, Fi02 45%.
The day following admission, [**2123-12-22**], WBC 20 (up from 15 day prior) and pt febrile to 103.
She underwent chest CT which showed PNA w/ large, complex effusion.
Additionally, CT showed possible filling defect in pulm artery, for which CTA was recommended to further eval.
Pt underwent flex bronch on [**12-23**], which showed small white exophytic playw in RML (likely aspirated food).
Biopy x2 of RML orifice and BAL of LLL performed.

Pt received cefepime for pseudomonal coverage per OSH cultures, and was started on vancomycin for MRSA in sputum.
A right-sided thoracentesis was performed on [**2123-12-27**] seeking to drain an effusion; this was complicated by the development of a pneumothorax which required the placement of a chest tube.
# Pulmonary embolism: CT w/o contrast demonstrated filling defect in pulmonary artery.
INR 1.3 on [**2123-12-30**].
Pt was initially placed on insulin gtt, which was then changed to NPH 30units x1 dose AM after MICU transfer.
NPH was titrated to control sugars Fs<150, and as of [**12-29**], was 20 units [**Hospital1 **].
Continue warfarin and titrate to INR 2.0-3.0. .
