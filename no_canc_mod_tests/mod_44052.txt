CXR [**8-16**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Non-diagnostic Doppler evaluation.
I would recommend correlation with MRA of the neck for further evaluation.
Markedly limited study, essentially nondiagnostic for evaluation of the distal vessels in the brain.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 year-old woman with DMII, Hyperlipidemia, obesity, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, h/o supressed TSH with cold thyroid nodule, benign essential hypertension who presented with word finding difficulties, SBP 230.
She was seen by neurology and felt not a TPA candidate because her score was only 1 and she recoved relatively quickly.
She was hypertensive in the ED BP was 196-256/71-136, HR 70's-80's sat 100% 3L NC, T 96.7.
On arrival to the medical floor her initial vital signs at 2230 were 180/88, 82, 20, 97% RA, temp 96.5.
Repeat VS at 0400 were 170/75, hr 72, rr 20, 96% on RA.
At 0800 she was noted to be 240/120, Hr 117, rr 40, 98% via 8L FM.
Stroke workup was negative, but her blood pressure was not controlled by PO medications.
Looking back in her records there was concern that she was becoming more hypertensive after beta blockers so these were D/C'd and plasma metanepherines were sent to eval for pheochromocytoma.
Her creatinine peaked at 2.7 and drifted down slowly with lasix diuresis.
We recommended she follow this up as an outpatient given the unclear reason for the acute worsening of her blood pressure and kidney disease this year.
