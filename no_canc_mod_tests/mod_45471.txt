It was decided with the family in the medical Intensive Care Unit that no further gastrointestinal procedures were to be done, but that if the patient required transfusions, transfusions will be given.
Hypotension: The patient had no further issues with hypotension and maintains normal heart rates and blood pressures on just beta-blocker and digoxin for rate control for his atrial fibrillation.
Gram negative rod bacteremia:  The patient has had surveillance cultures which have been negative to date for his initial bacteremia with pseudomonas.
His rate is controlled well on Lopressor and digoxin.
His phosphorus and calcium are followed closely with daily labs and he is on Renagel as a phosphate binder with good control.
His beta-blocker was restarted at a lower dose and this may be slowly titrated back up as his blood pressure tolerates.
