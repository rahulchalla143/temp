Echocardiogram at that time demonstrated global hypokinesis of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30%-40%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Temperature 98.3, blood pressure 105/58, heart rate 38, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
She had 2+ radial and dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Echocardiogram on [**2165-6-25**]: Global right ventricular hypokinesis with elevated pressure gradient across mitral valve, elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures.
Following her pacemaker revision, the patient's Coumadin was restarted with a goal INR of greater than 3.
IV heparin was continued until INR was greater than 3, at which time the heparin was discontinued, and the patient was continued on her current Coumadin dose.
At the time of discharge, INR was greater than 3, and the patient was recommended to follow-up with her primary care physician for continued Coumadin monitoring.
Emergent TEE was performed demonstrating a large thrombus    on the mitral valve.
Following thrombolysis, repeat echocardiogram demonstrated disappearance of the mitral valve thrombus.
Treatment was continued with IV heparin until Coumadin was therapeutic with an INR greater than 3 as above.
