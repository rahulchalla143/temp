She went to OSH where an EKG showed STE inferiorly, V5, V6, STD V1/2.
[**Hospital1 18**] cath lab was activated and pt was transferred for urgent cath.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2165-7-2**] ST segment elevations are present.
Hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated filling pressures, cardiac output/index was preserved.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF=55%).
Brief Hospital Course: # CAD/MI - Patient was admitted to the CCU after her cardiac catheterization where she had two bare metal stents placed in her OM1.
Her enzymes were monitored and peaked during her first day of admission.
# Pump - ECHO showed EF of 55% and physiologic MR with no change in wall motion abnormalities from previous ECHO.
# Rhythm - No issues during this admission.
# FEN - Electrolytes maintained at Mg >2 and K > 4.
# Dispo - PT consult: therapy 1-3x/week for 1 week, patient safe to return home with home PT and VNA care.
