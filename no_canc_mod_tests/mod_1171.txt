Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study.
TTE [**2178-3-24**]: The left atrium is dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-1-22**], prior views are suboptimal for comparison.
Cardiac cath [**2178-3-23**]: full report pending.
No issues   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMH CAD s/p CABG [**2153**] with SVG to RPDA, SVG to LAD, SVG to diagonal, s/p PCI to SVG-Diag 100% occluded, DES to SVG-LAD graft in [**4-29**], DESx2 to SVG-RPDA in [**9-30**], BMS to SVG-RCA in [**10-1**], DES to SVG to LAD [**2175**] and DES x2 to proximal and mid SVG to LAD in [**1-4**], and DESx2 to proximal and ostial [**Date Range **] in [**2-5**]; right renal artery stenosis s/p stenting [**3-31**], [**Month/Year (2) 2091**], DMII, HLD, HTN, GI bleed, small AAA presenting to OSH with chest pain.
While on the cardiology service the patient had troponins were neg x 3 the day of admission (1 day prior) but bumped to 0.08 the morning after.
EKG stable.
Given his initial chest pain and given the patient's extensive cardiac history, plan was to go for cath on [**2178-3-23**], which showed stenosis of the RCA graft.
EKG showed ST elevations in inferior leads.
hemolysis labs neg, retic index 1.2.  Review of prior records indicated pt has long history of anemia that predates worsened [**Last Name (LF) 2091**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] it was thought that this may be [**2-26**] thalassemia.
His Cr was 2.6 on admission and remained between 2.3 and 2.8 during his CCU course.
When exercised on EKG, he did have a good response and HR came up, indicating a higher AV block.
Your EKG was unchanged but you had elevated [**Hospital **] markers that indicated you could be having a heart attack.
You were also monitored for low heart rate which was stable and low kidney functions which seem to have improved.
