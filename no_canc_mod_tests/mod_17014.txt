An endobronchial obstructing lesion cannot be excluded on these radiographs.
[**9-7**] ECHO Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**9-21**] PA and lateral chest compared to [**9-14**] through [**9-18**]: A small amount of volume loss persists in the right upper lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: In the ED, her vital signs were T 99.9 HR 120 BP 114/50 RR 32 95%NRB.
A chest x-ray [**Last Name (un) **] da RUL pneumonia, and ECG showed afib with RVR.
Her lactate was 3.0 and creatinine 2.1.
# Rhabdomyolysis Upon presentation in the MICU, her CK was 1297 with large blood and few RBCs in the urine suspicious for rhabdomyolysis.
Her CPKs peaked at [**Numeric Identifier 6235**] on [**9-15**] along with transaminases in the 300's.
Her last CK [**9-20**] was 3000, and she continued to have a stable creatinine until discharge.
Echocardiography showed a normal heart with LVH and preserved EF (>55%).
On discharge, she has borderline macrocytic anemia with near-appropriate reticulocyte production and Fe studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Hypertension Her blood pressure was titrated with IV beta-blocker in the MICU and switched oiver to PO beta-blocker once the patient was taking good POs.
Pt discharged on stable regimen of metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **] with BPs in the 120s -130s except before morning meds.
Resumption of a statin as an outpatient is likely clinically indicated.
If you develop any new or concerning symptom such as shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers to greater than 101F, or a fast irregular heartbeat; please seek medical attention as soon as possible.
