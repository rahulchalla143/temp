Brief Hospital Course: On admission to floor pt's vital were T 101.8 HR 116 BP 118/60 vented at 17/650/50% with 8 of peep with sats of 92% and initial ABG of 7.21/83/11.
With his elevated WBC, bandemia and spiking fevers, CXR, sputum cx, blood cx, ucx were obtained for fever workup.
Blood culture showed strep viridans, but this was likey contaminated.
CT scan showed bullous lung disease, patchy opacities, and collapse of lower lobes bilaterally.
Bronchoscopy showed small amounts of thick mucus.
Alpha1-antitrypsin and HIV serologies were sent to workup etiology of the small bullous lesion seen on CT scan, however both were negative and it is felt that the lesions were due to barotrauma, as evident by pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and bilateral pneumothoraces.
