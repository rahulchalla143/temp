Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).

Her telemetry showed sinus tachycardia up to the 140s.
EMG done [**6-23**] was consistent with [**Last Name (un) 4584**] [**Location (un) **] syndrome and the overall impression is that she's hitting her nadir now.
MRI C and T spine was normal.
She continued having episodes of sinus tachycardia (HR>140) as part of the dysautonomia associated with [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome, and was treated with 2.5 mg intravenous metoprolol, if the heart rate remained sustained at 140 and she was symptomatic.
A repeat U/A was performed under more clean conditions which was consistent with menstruation (trace leukocytes and a large amount of blood).
Discharge Instructions: You have been admitted with progression of your [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome.
