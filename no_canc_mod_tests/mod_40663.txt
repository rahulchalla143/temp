In ED, noted to have a BP max of 211/83, on head CT found to have a ~ 20cc hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia and corona radiata.

IntraCranial Hemorrhage, likely secondary to hypertension or anticoagulation as INR =3.4 upon admission.
His neurologic exam was significant for left face/arm/leg weakness and sensory loss.
His second head CT worsened in that he developed interventricular extension of the bleed.
Repeat head CT showed hydrocephalus.
The hydrocephalus resolved over a period of a few days, CSF cultures grew nothing, and his drain stopped producing CSF.
CT showed resolved hydrocephalus and the drain was removed.
His temperature was more persistently elevated vs. spike like pattern, thus it was thought his fever was more central in origin given his ICH.
ALso, an EEG was checked given his altered mental status - no signs of epileptiform activity were seen.
His INR was maintained at <1.3 with activated factor 7 given in the ED and multiple transfusions with FFP.
His glucose was controlled with an insulin gtt.
Hemolysis labs were normal except for a slight elevation in indirect bilirubin which resolved spontaneously.
TSH and retic count were normal.
Additionally he was also thrombocytopenic with platelets nadiring at 97K.
Blood cultures were obtained to ensure no sepsis (and they were no growth with the exception of [**12-21**] bottles growing staph aureus coag neg, likely a contaminant) and DIC labs were normal with the exception of an elevated ddimers of unknown significance.
BP was controlled in the ICU with a labetolol drip and a PO regimen was initiated upon transfer to the floor.
He also had a swallowing evaluation and he was found to be safe to eat pureed solids and nectar thick liquids.
On [**2167-7-8**] he had 1/2 blood cultures become positive for gram positive cocci in clusters, clinically however, he has remained afebrile.
We are recommending he continue the zosyn for 7 more days and if his blood cultures are not a contaminant, we will contact his rehab facility.
