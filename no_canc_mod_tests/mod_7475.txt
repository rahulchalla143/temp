EKG showed baseline LBBB, s/p arrest EKG showing deep ST depressions in V2-3 post code.
[**Location (un) 620**] ED attempted a subclavian on left but couldn't threat wire, L femoral line placed instead (has hx right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] graft).
Past Medical History: - CAD, MI [**11-28**], (S/P cath with PTCA to OM in [**4-30**], s/p CABG [**2163-1-6**] [**Location 1268**], LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA & OM) CATH performed on [**2169-3-4**] : Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease, Patent LIMA and vein grafts, widely patent OM stent.
- CHF, EF 55% - DM - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - End stage renal disease, dialysis dependent, AV fistula in L arm.
- Peripheral vascular disease s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] on right - s/p toe amputations .
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**4-30**]: EF 55%.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-24**], no definite change (prior study was of poor quality to exclude above findings).
CARDIAC CATH [**3-1**]: 1. patent LIMA to LAD with no significant disease distal to the [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an opening aortic pressure of 114/61mmHg.
Physical Exam: VS: T 96.9 BP 97/58 HR 104 (AFib) RR 16 O2 100% on CMV 600x20/8/100% Gen: elderly appearing male, intubated, sedated, nonresponsive.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+ Left: Carotid 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+   Pertinent Results: LABORATORY DATA at OSH: WBC 13.5, HCT 32.6, Plt 137 Na 142, K 5.3, Cl 104, Co2 27, Bun 44, Cr 7.0, Gluc 192 Ca 11.8, Mg 2.0, Alt 35, AST 33, CK 98, MB 1.6, Trop T 0.240 (baseline)  LAB DATA [**Hospital1 18**]: [**2169-6-22**]   PT-14.1* PTT-53.3* INR(PT)-1.3*  [**2169-6-22**] WBC-12.3* RBC-3.63* HGB-11.7* HCT-35.7* MCV-99* MCH-32.3* MCHC-32.8 RDW-17.8*NEUTS-88.9* LYMPHS-4.2* MONOS-6.6 EOS-0.1 BASOS-0.1 GLUCOSE-188* UREA N-49* CREAT-7.8* SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-4.5 CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-29 ALBUMIN-3.6 CALCIUM-10.2 PHOSPHATE-6.7* MAGNESIUM-2.2 ALT(SGPT)-105* AST(SGOT)-127* LD(LDH)-274* CK(CPK)-165 ALK PHOS-82 AMYLASE-69 TOT BILI-0.6  [**2169-6-22**] 09:27AM   CK-MB-13* MB INDX-7.9* cTropnT-0.49* [**2169-6-22**] 06:21PM   CK(CPK)-126 CK-MB-15* MB INDX-11.9* cTropnT-0.91*  [**2169-6-22**] TYPE-ART PO2-147* PCO2-38 PH-7.49* TOTAL CO2-30 BASE XS-6  IMAGING: CXR [**2169-6-22**]: Increased right lower lobe opacity, probably due to pulmonary edema or infection.
TTE [**6-22**]: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction - EF = 20-25%.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-5-2**], LV systolic function has markedly deteriorated and severity of MR has increased.
CXR [**2169-6-23**]: More extensive left lower lobe opacity, probably due to atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Electrolyte abnormality was unlikely given stable electrolytes at OSH.
Ischemic etiology was unlikely given cardiac enzymes not commensurate with that of MI.
BP was maintained with a levophed drip, which was slowly weaned as tolerated.
Follow-up echo on [**2169-6-22**] showed EF of 20-25% with severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which had markedly deteriorated.
4)Poor oxygenation: CXR findings on [**6-22**] (above) were initally read as concerning for PE.
Subsequent CXR findings (Above) showed evidence of a LLL infiltrate and + sputum stain of GPC on [**6-22**], and the patient was empirically treated for a PNA with vancomycin/levofloxacin/flagyl.
