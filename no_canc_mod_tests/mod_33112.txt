She saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] on the day of admission for routine follow up and for evaluation of ongoing abdominal discomfort.
She had labs drawn for routine follow up and for continued evaluation for liver transplant.
Her INR returned at 13.7 and her Hct was 25.7.
Of note, she reports her INR was 2.7 two weeks ago.
She had a LGIB and was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] a few years prior to her PE.
In the ED initial vital signs were: T 98.3 P 116 BP 126/54 R 18 O2 sat 100% on RA.
Imaging studied obtained this admission so far include a CT head which showed no signs of hemorrhage and abdominal US which showed no acites, a fatty liver, and no subcapsular hemorrhage.
She was transfused an additional 2U pRBC and her H/H rose to 10.2/28.2.
A repeat H/H was essentially unchanged.
Her INR peaked at 18.0 and subsequently fell to 1.7 at the time of transfer.
She is being tranfered to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4869**] for further management.
hemachromatosis, diagnosed by labs studies in [**2134**]; however, subsequent genetic testing has been negative.
She did undergo a Port-A-Cath placement due to poor peripheral venous access for serial phlebotomies which have been occurring since late [**2134**] and [**2135**].

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) PORT Study Date of [**2136-4-27**] 9:21 PM [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] images were obtained that demonstrate the liver to be of increased echogenicity and heterogeneous echotexture compatible with known cirrhosis.
Evaluation for mass lesion severely compromised.
Brief Hospital Course: 57F with a Hx of PE on warfarin + etOH cirrhosis and possible hemochromotosis admitted with symptomatic anemia with an H/H of 6.5/18.6 and INR of 18.
Her INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K and she was transfused 4U pRBC.
Her H/H stabilized and she underwent an elective endoscopy which showed mild gastritis.
She was discharged off coumadin with close follow up to determine if the morbidity of anticoagulation outweighs the risks given this is her second GI bleed since her PE and there is little evidence that a single PE merits AC for >6 months.
Baseline HCT appears to be around 26-28 based on review of OMR.
Of note, patient has chronic anemia, and iron studies in [**Month (only) 956**] of this year demonstrated iron deficiency anemia with a ferritin of 17.
EGD [**2136-4-30**] showed mild gastritis and no bleeding varices or ulcers.
Received additional dose of vitamin K for rising INR prior to discharge.
LFTs were within normal limits on admission.
