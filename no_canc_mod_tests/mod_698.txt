Past Medical History: - HIV >10 yrs [**5-3**] CD4 202, VL 27,200 - End-stage renal disease secondary to HIV nephropathy- on PD - CHF EF 25% - Anemia on Aranesp.
Physical Exam: MICU admit PE T 99.1 BP 161/131 HR 130 RR 16 O2sats 96% on RA Gen: Very lethargic, falling asleep throughout exam and not complying with my requests, periodically apneic with snoring (OSA) HEENT: PERRL, mmm, anicteric Neck: unable to assess JVD as patient would not sit up Lungs: CTAB but very poor effort Heart: RRR no m/r/g Abd: Distended but soft, + fluid wave, NT, hypoactive bowel sounds Ext: no edema Neuro: To lethargic to due exam, no asterixis  Pertinent Results: ECG [**2117-1-16**]- Sinus tachycardia, LAD, LVH nl intervals, no ST/T wave changes .
CTA chest [**2117-1-16**]- No PE.
CXR [**2117-1-16**]- Probable mild asymmetric pulmonary edema, given the prior appearance of the same on earlier radiograph.
Calculated LVEF 23%.
ECHO [**2117-1-18**]: - EF 20-25% The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-8-14**], the findings are similar.
Given the normal ascending aortic and left atrial size, the absence of a history of systemic hypertension, the prominent symmetric hypertrophy suggests an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid).
An ABG on admission to the MICU revealed that the patient was in hypoxic respiratory failure.
In addition, the differential on admission included: - head bleed: Head CT negative for bleed or mass lesions - delirium tremens: he was monitored for evidence of worsening tachycardia/tremulousness,hypertension and placed on a CIWA scale.
- Infection - [**Year (4 digits) **] cx and peritoneal diasylated cultures were negative.
-Metabolic disturbance - TSH, Ca, Lytes were wnl .
# DOE - our intial diagnoses included CHF(known EF of 25%), PE, volume overload due to failure to due PD, ACS, PNA (community acquired vs atypical vs PCP).
- [**1-17**] : intubated for hypoxia along with general restlessness of patient which made dialysis and other management very difficult -> he was found to have picture of acute pulmonary edema.
-Cardiac enzymes found to be elevated, but this was ascribed to his baseline renal failure.
-Induced sputum was negative for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was placed on a treatment dose of IV bactrim, but this was discontinued when he was found to be PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5963**].
- repeat ECHO on [**2117-1-18**] reveal symmetric LVH with EF ~ 25% .
No history of CAD and normal perfusion stress test in [**9-2**], however patient at risk for accelerrated development of CAD due to HIV and HAART regimen(if he is taking), tobacco use and crack cocaine use.
Please report to the nearest emergency department if you have fever, chills, abdominal pain, abdominal distension (worsening pain), nausea or vomiting or shortness of breath.
