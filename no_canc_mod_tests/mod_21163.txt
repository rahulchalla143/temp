He did not have any associated chest pain or palpitations, but an EKG done at his primary care's office revealed evidence of an old myocardial infarction.
Because of this syncopal episode he underwent a stress test which demonstrated some ST and T wave abnormalities in the inferior and lateral precordial leads which increased with exercise.
He did have nuclear imaging which revealed a large severe inferolateral wall defect that was reversible and an inferolateral wall hypokinesis.
He was then referred to cardiology for catheterization and was found to have 3-vessel disease, and then he was brought to the cardiac surgery service for definitive treatment.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His heart rate was 89 in sinus rhythm, his blood pressure is 139/71, he is breathing 17, his O2 saturation is 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  Included a white count of 5.3, hematocrit of 37, platelets of 157, an INR of 1.1, a BUN of 18, a creatinine of 1.2.
The remainder of his labs were unremarkable.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  An echocardiogram done at an outside hospital in [**Month (only) 958**] demonstrated inferior and posterior hypokinesis, an EF of 45%, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
The stress test on [**2142-4-17**] demonstrated increased ST segment depression in the inferior and lateral precordial leads, large severe inferolateral wall defect reversible at the base which was fixed at the apex, and inferolateral hypokinesis with an EF of 40%.
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a hypokinetic inferior wall, a 100% RCA occlusion, a 70% LAD occlusion, a 95% proximal circumflex occlusion and a complete distally.
He had an EF of 49%.
His preoperative EKG showed a sinus rhythm with left shift of his axis and lateral ST-T wave changes, consistent with an old MI.
On the floor he did develop contact dermatitis which was monitored.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  He is going to be discharged to home with home services to follow vital signs, and medications, and sternal wound which has remained clean, dry, and intact.
