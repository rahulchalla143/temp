Blood cultures remained negative .
CXR [**5-29**]: Unchanged appearance of the chest without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
It was also felt that his blood pressure medications had been given all together and this compounded his drop in blood pressure.
The patient was given IVF with resolution of ARF; his creatinine returned to baseline 1.4.
As his creatinine responded to fluids, the renal team felt that the etiology of his renal failure was pre-renal.
Renal US showed asymmetric sized kidneys.
A renal US was done on admission to evaluate cause of ARF which showed that the patient had asymmetric sized kidneys and raised the possibility of renal artery stenosis in the setting of starting an ACE-I.
Once his blood pressure stabilized, losartan and metoprol were restarted.
OSA: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a sleep study done which reaffirmed complex sleep-disordered breathing with partially successful titration study.
HTN:  Once his blood pressure stabilized he was put back on Losartan and Metoprolol.
Anemia: The patient's hematocrit ranged between 32-34 which appears to be his baseline.
Fe studies in [**11-6**] were consistent with ACD.
We recommend that the patient undergo outpatient evaluation by hematology for chronically low hematocrit.
CAD:  He did have one episode of epigastric abdominal discomfort while in hospital for which he had serial EKGs and serial enzymes, which did not show any evidence of an ongoing acute coronary syndrome.
Diastolic dysfunction: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a recent Echo on [**11-6**] which showed an EF of 65%.
His Is/Os and weights were closely monitored and he remained asymptomatic from this perspective.
Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
