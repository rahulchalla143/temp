Cath showed LCX 70%, complete RCA occlusion with collaterals, right axillary 95%, right carotid 90%.
Stress testing on [**2152-10-25**] showed a small reversible inferior defect in the AC non-corrected images.
In [**7-12**], she was referred for aortoiliac ultrasound, carotid study that showed severe stenosis of the R internal carotid artery and moderate stenosis of the L internal carotid artery.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: [**2133**]: s/p cardiac cath with PTCA of mid RCA and OM [**2134**] showed chronically occluded RCA [**2137**] & [**2139**] showed no significant change -- see above for today LHC) - PACING/ICD: 3.
-?h/o DVT in [**2111**] -- also not documented, also no A/C, also does not recall details other than her leg hurt and it came on all of a sudden, and it went away with some sort of short-term treatment.

Cardiac cath [**9-19**]: 1.
Cardiac cath [**9-21**]: Angiography and PTA COMMENTS: After clearing the guide, first the right brachiocephalic artery was engaged and then the right common carotid artery.
Cerebral angiography showed patent RMCA and RACA.
Final angiography showed the [**Country **] stent with no residual stenosis, excellent flow.
At the end of the case the patient's blood pressure was low and IVF and  neosynephrine was started.
Cerebral angiography at end of case showed the RMCA and RACA patent.
The patient's neurologic exam was unchanged and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
Goal SBP 100-120 mmHg.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 73 y/o with a history of CAD, exertional angina, initially referred for cardiac catheterization done on [**9-19**] which showed LCX 40-60%, right axillary 95%, right carotid 90%, now s/p axillary ballooning [**9-20**] and carotid stenting [**9-21**].
Neuro examination stable without any gross motor or sensory defects.
Neurologic exam was performed every four hours and was not concerning cfor any changes, noting baseline left facial droop and visual sxs of zigzags which she occasionally gets with migraines.
