Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  On [**2-11**], his weight was 1655 grams.

An ACTH stimulation test was previously done, which showed a smaller cortisol stimulation than expected, although interpretation was difficult given the prematurity of the infant.
The stimulation test will be repeated prior to discharge.
During this interim period, an attempt was made to space the feeds from q3 to q.4h., but resulted in intermittent blood sugars in the 40s.
Hematology:  Most recent hematocrit was 32 with a reticulocyte count of 2.8% on [**2-28**].
Infectious disease:  Because of the patient's continued mild nasal congestion, respiratory washings were sent for direct immunofluorescence as well as viral culture on [**2-19**].
However, on [**2-24**], the viral cultures showed evidence of cytopathic effect consistent with CMV.
Urine CMV was sent on [**3-6**] with results pending, as well as CMV IgG and IgM and CMV PCR sent [**3-7**].
Liver function tests on [**3-7**] are largely normal with an ALT of 8, AST 18, total bilirubin 0.7, alkaline phosphatase mildly elevated at 594.
A CBC sent on [**3-7**] was normal with a white blood cell count of 12.9 with 13% polys, 68% lymphocytes, hematocrit 32, and no evidence of thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 197,000.
Infectious Disease was consulted and the work-up continues.
Furthermore, head ultrasounds in the past on days of life one, seven, and 30 were also normal, as have been ophthalmologic examinations during screening for retinopathy of prematurity.
Most recent ophthalmologic exam on [**2-22**] showed zone three bilaterally with immature retina, with followup planned during the first week of [**Month (only) 958**].
Routine healthcare maintenance:  Last newborn state screen was sent on [**1-31**] with normal results.
Hepatitis B #1 and #2 as well as a two-month immunizations have been administered.
