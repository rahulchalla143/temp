In light of these symptoms, patient's gastroenterologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2643**] recommended an outpatient CT scan of her abdomen and CT was read as free air on Monday, and patient was told to come into the ED.
In the Emergency Room upon arrival, patient noted to have a blood pressure that was hypotensive.
She was administered 4 liters of normal saline over several hours with increase in blood pressure to 105/50 and subsequently developed hypoxemia, orthopnea, and CHF by chest x-ray.
Echocardiogram by wet read showed an ejection fraction of 30% and patient's CT reread as no retroperitoneal air and cleared by surgery.
She was admitted to the MICU for further evaluation of hypotension and CHF.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 96.4, blood pressure 105/47, pulse 70, respiratory rate 19, and O2 92% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Moist mucous membranes, right greater than left carotid bruit.
Neck with jugular venous pressure about 12 cm, supple neck, no lymphadenopathy, no masses.
Positive left femoral bruit, 2+ femoral and PT pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Notable for a white count of 9.4, hematocrit of 34.6, platelets of 441.
Chem-7 with a sodium of 128, potassium 4.4, chloride 87, bicarb 30, BUN 19, creatinine 0.9, glucose 166, calcium 9.0, magnesium 1.6.
CK of 92.
Troponin of 0.28.
Urinalysis was otherwise negative.
Lactate of 1.2.
AST 28, ALT 23, alkaline phosphatase 114, total bilirubin 0.4, lipase 14.
CT of the abdomen showed thickened walls of the colon, sigmoid colon and rectum.
Chest x-ray with mild CHF.
Echocardiogram with an EF of 30% with 2+ MR, anterior distal septal, apical lateral, and inferior hypokinesis, akinesis, mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
EKG initially was normal sinus rhythm at 55, new biphasic T's in V1, T-wave inversions in V3 and V4, V5, I, and aVL, and poor R-wave progression.
From records from the [**Hospital1 756**] prior to CABG, she had an EF of 55%.
Her coronary catheterization showed severe three vessel disease and an ejection fraction of 34%.
Was started on 18 hours of an Integrilin drip, tolerated that well, and continued on aspirin, Plavix, and beta blocker after catheterization.
Patient did have evidence of hyperinflation on chest x-ray and has a long smoking history, although this may not have been previously diagnosed, patient probably has baseline oxygen saturations around 94%.
Patient had one episode of chest tightness and EKG at that time showed patient was in AFib with a rate of 146.
Patient was also noted after cardioversion and after cardiac catheterization to have episodes of NSVT going up to 12-13 beats.
These were all asymptomatic, however, the frequency of these episodes were concerning, and patient was evaluated by the Electrophysiology department and plans were made to return in one month's time to have an Electrophysiology study and likely placement of a defibrillator and AICD because of concerns for ischemic cardiomyopathy with NSVT.
Patient had flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies done which showed diverticulosis of the proximal sigmoid colon, a polyp 20 cm in the sigmoid colon.
Patient had pathology of the biopsies which were consistent with chronic active colitis.
To rule out ischemic colitis, patient had a MRI/MRA done of her abdomen which showed multifocal stenoses of the superior mesenteric artery seen, but there appeared to be good collaterals provided via the transverse pancreatic artery to pancreatic branches from the SMA.
This was more likely attributed to her Crohn's flareup, however, concerns for cholangitis can be ruled out and with elevated LFTs and history of gallstones, plans were made to do a ERCP or MRCP to evaluate her biliary tree.
Patient will return in one month's time to have an ERCP done at the same time she returns for Electrophysiology study.
However, with increased steroid regimen, patient was started on a NPH sliding scale regimen through the course of her stay for better blood sugar control especially in light of her ischemia.
Otherwise, the patient's fingersticks and blood sugars remained stable.
However, with coronary artery disease and active ischemia, goal was to keep hematocrit greater than 30.
She did have her phosphorus and magnesium repleted at time, however, all remained within normal limits.
Prophylaxis:  Patient was continued on a proton-pump inhibitor, her Ambien and Coumadin which will be continued indefinitely with a goal INR of [**3-13**].
Patient will be called to return for ERCP on [**2-21**] and after the ERCP, the patient will remain for an EP study the following day.
Patient will then be transferred to West for the EP study per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12246**] on [**2-22**].
