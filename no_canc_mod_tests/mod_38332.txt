Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2130-4-14**]): 1.
Limited study due to the lack of intravenous contrast.
Extensive peripancreatic fat stranding and retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal fluid collections, stable since the prior study, and are consistent with acute pancreatitis.
