She was found to be tachycardic to the 140's, febrile to 103.8 (rectal), BP 138/114.
A femoral line was placed as PIV access, and a RIJ were unable to be obtained.
Vitals were stable.

Imaging: EEG Study Date of [**2166-6-11**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured six pushbutton activations, but they showed the same background as on routine sampling.
Raised pressure and anoxia are other possibilities.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2166-6-12**] 5:57 PM 1.
While there is no evidence of recent infarction, evaluation is limited on CT, and MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**]- weighted imaging is recommended if clinically indicated.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2166-6-12**] 5:58 PM 1.
ECHO Study Date of [**2166-6-12**] Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction 30-40 percent)secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the apical half of the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
LUNG SCAN  [**2166-6-18**] IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation.
Injection of contrast through the tube confirms the G-tube tip to be within the stomach, and the distal J-tube tip to be within the jejunum.
7/20:07: CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a right subclavian central line with its tip in the right atrium.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver is mildly enlarged measuring approximately 20 cm in sagittal dimension.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The uterus and adnexal regions are within normal limits.
A follow- up CT is recommended to assess for interval change if clinically indicated.
Comparison with the previous study done [**2166-6-30**].

Pt had a bronchial lavage culture from [**6-17**] that is pending; no organism were seen on gram stain.
Pt also got a V/Q scan that showed low likelihood for PE.
However, electrolytes and renal function should be followed to direct diuresis.
She had serial blood cultures drawn that did not show any growth.
Her central line was changed over a wire, and a number of medications were stopped.
Hypothyroidism (TSH 0.02, fT4 3.9):  Pt started on methimazol 5 mg po bid on [**6-18**].
Her thyroid function tests should be checked [**7-7**] to confirm that she is at the correct dosage.
CT abd ([**6-12**]).
She continued to have discomfort and an abdominal ultrasound was inconclusive.
Chronic anemia:  She had persistent anemia and occasionally required transfusions to keep her hct above 21.
She received a total of 3 units PRBCs [**6-13**], [**6-21**], [**6-28**].
Her systolic blood pressures range in the 120-150s with this regimen.

She should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in endocrinology when able to go to the appointment (with thyroid function tests checked prior the appointment).
