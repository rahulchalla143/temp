Patient has AF and had problems with multiple episodes of supratherapeutic INR last 3.3 on [**4-22**] and were holding warfarin at rehab planning to restart at 1mg tonight.
BP was noted as 158/[**Age over 90 **] yesterday.
His exam somewhat improved regarding his speech which was initially anarthric and felt severe non-fluent aphasia as not verbalising butthsi improved and although difficult to understand was able to name pretty well suggesting mostly dysarthria.
Patient BP then settled in 160s/100s and given INR 2.0 was reversed with Factor 9 Complex and 10mg IT vitamin K. He was started on a nicardipine drip.

Patient was initially admitted to the neuro ICU for close monitoring and IV nicardipine.
# Neurology: At rehab, patient had problems with multiple episodes of supratherapeutic INR last 3.3 on [**4-22**] and were holding warfarin at rehab since.
Initial NIHSS was 17 and patient had what seemed to be a severe non-fluent aphasia although latterly this seemed to represent most likely just significant dysarthria and was initially almost anarthric with no clearly intelligible speech but was gesturing and trying to vocalise without clear words, nodding and shaking head appropriately.
CT head showed an acute, 1.7 x 1.2 x 2.0 cm left thalamocapsular hemorrhage with minimal edema and no mass effect.
He was monitored on telemetry which showed paroxysmal AF.
Stroke risk factors were assessed and HbA1c was 4.9% and FLP revealed Chol 173 TGCs 82 HDL 49 LDL 108.
His ammonia was 61-60 and serum tox screen was negative.
CEs were elevated and stable and there were no new ECG changes and this was attributed to his CRF and possible demand ischemia with discharge TnT 0.12.
An NGT was placed and his home BP medications lisinopril was started and Metoprolol was introduced at a reduced dose.
Repeat NCHCT stable and HTN was better controlled with uptitrating his anti-hypertensives.
# Renal: Patient has CRF and Cr was at baseline ranging from 1.3 to 1.5 and 1.3 on discharge.
# Nutrition: Patient initially had an NG tube and was evaluated by SS eval and was passed for pureed solids and thin liquids.
He was noted to have a slight downtrend in his WCC to 3.8 and PLT 181 and this should be trended at rehab.
His ammonia was 61-60.
Transitional issues: - We stopped warfarin and patient was continued on s/c heparin and aspirin 81mg qd - Up-titrating anti-HTN medications and will need further uptitration at rehab - Catheter inserted on transfer and for voiding trial at rehab - Trend CBC at rehab given slight decrease in WCC and PLT  Medications on Admission: Was on warfarin INR 3.3 on [**4-22**] and holding Acetaminophen 650mg PRN Allopurinol 100mg qd Aspirin 81mg qd Docusate [**Hospital1 **] Lactulose 10ml [**Hospital1 **] Lisinopril 5mg qd Metoprolol tartrate 75mg qid MVI Omeprazole 40mg qd Bisacodyl 10mg PR  qd Senna HS  Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Coordination normal on left and unable to assess due to weakness on the right.
You were initially admitted to the Neuro ICU and your blood thinner (warfarin) was reversed to reduce the risk of further bleeding and you were initially treated with an IV medication to lower your blood pressure.
Your repeat CT scan was stable and you remained stable and clinically improved.
