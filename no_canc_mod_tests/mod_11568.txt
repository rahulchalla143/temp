CXR ([**2175-2-17**]) IMPRESSION: 1)  Right perihilar opacification may be due to pneumonia or right hilar mass.
Recommend dedicated chest CTA to evaluate for aortic aneurysm and lung algorithm to further assess pleural disease and right hilar abnmormality.
CT of chest w/o contrast ([**2175-2-18**]) IMPRESSION: 1.
Followup imaging after resolution of the acute process is recommended to evaluate for resolution of these regions.
Echo ([**2175-2-17**]) Conclusions: EF 35-40% The left atrium is elongated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
He was called to the floor on [**2175-2-19**] after clinical stabilization and O2 sat 96% on 2L by the time he reached the floor.
He had a chest CT with contrast which was negative for malignancy or aorto-esophageal fistula, but showed multifocal pneumonia.
His Hct and pulmonary status remained stable on the floor and he was to follow up with his pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41740**] at [**Hospital3 7362**] upon d/c.
We followed his CES, which trended down.
ASA was also initially d/c'ed at the MICU aafter TCP, and was resumed on [**2175-2-19**] after his platelets stabilized for cardiac protection.
cardiology was consulted and recommended no urgent indication for cath given medical comorbidities, and continue medical management with lopressor, ACEI, aldactone, Imdur and statin.
3 CHF: Echo at the OSH showed EF = 25% on [**2-16**], but repeat Echo at the [**Hospital1 **] showed 35-40% here with severe MR with 1-2+ TR here on admission.
BNP = 30K on admission.
We continue lopressor and titrate up to HR = 60 and SBP = 110.
