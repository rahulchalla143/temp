[**10-23**] CXR Cardiac size is top normal.
UROSEPSIS- secondary to pyelonephritis given findings on CT abdomen, urinalysis and physical exam.
In the ICU, Admission Chest X-rays were negative for infection and non-focal neuro exam suggested against meningitis.
Dopamine (initial pressor) was changed to levophed, and mean arterial pressure was titrated to > 65 mmHg.
Patient's urine output continued to improve during her ICU course and her blood pressures improved.
On [**10-21**], pressors were discontinued and patient was observed- her blood pressures remained stable over 24 hours off pressors.
Pneumonia - due to presence of increased left lower lobe opacity and probable evidence for superimposed infection in the bilateral basis, decision was made to treat with levofloxacin 750mg q48hrs, but repeat CXR showed improvement in bilateral atelectasis.
Acute renal failure - Admission Creatinine was 1.4 which was likely prerenal given her hypotension.
Creatinine trend continued to improve during her course and was at her baseline on discharge.
Repeat EKG on [**10-21**] showed resolution of her EKG changes.
She had lipids checked and revealed LDL of 100 and triglycerides of 188.
She would benefit from an outpatient stress test given the above history.
In the emergency room, your blood pressure was low and you were given fluids, antibiotics and were sent to the ICU.
Your CT scan images showed that you had an infection in your kidney.
You also had a chest X ray that was concerning for a pneumonia, but the repeat imaging does not look like you have this.
