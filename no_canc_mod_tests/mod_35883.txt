Small bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary [**Month/Day (4) 1106**] redistribution.
No significant change from previous exam of [**2185-11-30**].
CXR [**4-5**]: IMPRESSION:  CHF with predominant interstitial edema, which is new compared with [**2188-4-2**] at 17:00 p.m.  Small bilateral effusions and patchy bibasilar opacity.
CXR [**4-8**]: FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**4-5**], there is increased engorgement of ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with worsening [**Date Range 1106**] congestion.
CXR [**4-9**]: In comparison with the study of [**4-8**], there has been substantial clearing of the bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
ECHO [**4-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-2-5**], findings are similar, and suggest significant diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle coupled with borderline/mild mitral stenosis, with the predictable consequence of severe pulmonary hypertension.
CXR [**4-10**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, likely to reflect improved ventilation.
There are still signs indicative of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, but these have improved as compared to the previous examination.
CXR [**4-11**]: New asymmetric opacification in the lateral aspect of the left mid and lower lung zones and perhaps a smaller area in the right upper lobe highlighting the minor fissure, in the absence of mediastinal or pulmonary [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] engorgement is most likely pneumonia.
CT Chest noncon ([**4-13**]): 1.
Calcified atherosclerotic [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease of the aorta and coronary arteries.
CXR [**4-14**]: IMPRESSION:  Improving multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
Microbiology: urine [**4-3**]: no growth stool [**4-3**]: c. diff negative    Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2188-4-17**]):       No respiratory viruses isolated.
Culture screened for Adenovirus, Influenza A & B, Parainfluenza type       1,2 & 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus..
Detection of viruses other than those listed above will only be       performed on specific request.
Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2188-4-15**]):       Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
Refer to respiratory viral culture for further information.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75-year-old female with ESRD, hypertension, COPD, status post LRRT [**2180**] w/ cardiac cath showing 3VD who was deemed a non-surgical candidate for her coronary artery disease, and was managed for respiratory distress, likely secondary to COPD and dCHF.
For blood pressure, would consider hydralazine as next medication (renal transplant team is okay with thims).
# CORONARIES: positive stress test concerning for 3 vessel disease sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
cath showed LMCA without angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenosis, LAD had a 60% mid-vessel stenosis, the LCx had a 70% mid and distal stenosis, and the RCA had subtotal distal stenosis with left to right collaterals.
Several studies were obtained for pre-op assessment and the pt was cleared for CABG on [**4-7**].
ABG was done and did not show that pt was chronic retainer.
she also completed a z-pack, a few days of levaquin and a few days of broad spectrum antibiotics.
# Diastolic CHF: Chronic compensated with LVEF 55%.
the pt became hypoxic w/ O2 sats in the 70s and BP went up to 220s.
hydralazine did not bring down her BP, but she was given 80mg IV lasix total and started on nitro drip which brought BP to 140s.
Weight at discharge is 88 kg.
# Hypertension:  Patient blood pressures were quite elevated with SBPs in the 170s.
Patient's blood pressures stable (< 140s) on day prior to discharge.
# Pneumonia: Found to have potential RLL pneumonia on CXR and CT chest.
Started on Vancomycin/Cefepime on [**4-12**] for HCAP, but discontinued as no fevers, or WBC elevations, and most likely etiology of pulm issues CHF and COPD.
