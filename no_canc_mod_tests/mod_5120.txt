She will continue on her aspirin, and her metoprolol will be titrated up as tolerated.
Her INR was subtherapeutic on 2 mg coumadin during this admission and her dose was increased to 3 mg QD.
Her INR was 1.4 on discharge and will need to be followed as an outpatient.
Your metoprolol is at a lower dose (37.5 mg) than before, but can be increased by your primary care doctor if your blood pressure remains good.
