CXray [**12-8**]: IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia.
Colonoscopy [**12-5**]: Impression: Normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Recommend capsule endoscopy for further evaluation of melena.
Colonoscopy in 5 years  Upper endoscopy [**12-5**]: Impression: Small hiatal hernia Erythema and erosion in the fundus Erythema in the antrum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Recommendations: Will proceed to colonoscopy for evaluation of melena.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year-old man with a PMH of CAD (s/p CABG and multiple PCIs) on aspirin, aortic valve replacement on coumadin, dCHF who presents with chest pain, lightheadedness and melena found to have HCT of 19.1 transferred to MICU for GI bleed.
Pt was in stable condition so transferred to cardiology service where he underwent EGD, colonoscopy, and small capsule study without evidence of active bleed.
# GI Bleed/Anemia: Pt had lightheadedness, chest pain, melanotic stools, and a HCT of 19 on [**12-2**] admission with ED noting heme positive stool.
Pt had a supratherapeutic INR to 4.9 on [**2135-11-29**].
EGD, colonoscopy, and small capsule study were negative for active bleeding source although small capsule study did reveal two angioectasias in the jejunum.
GI bleed likely resulted in iron deficiency anemia as the patient's labs were mostly consistent with this--a microcytic anemia with low ferritin, low iron, low % transferrin saturation, hypochromatic cells with the presence of ovalocytes.
Although he was iron deficient, his marrow showed appropriate response with a retic index of 2.65%.
Notably, the patient's LDH and haptoglobin were normal on admission, making it extremely unlikely the patient was undergoing any sort of hemolysis at presentation.
Furthermore, urine hemoglobin and hemosiderin were negative further aruging against intravascular hemolysis.
# Pneumonia - Patient became febrile to 102 degrees on [**12-8**] and continued to spike on [**12-9**] with cxrays x2 demonstrating LLL pneumonia.
However, because blood and urine cultures were negative and cxray was suggestive of pna, the patient was initially started on HAP with vancomycin and cefepime before transitioning to PO levofloxacin, which he was discharged on after he was afebrile on this for >24 hours.
Target INR is 2.0-3.0 .
Monitor pts INR as pt seems to have GI bleeding tendency when INR is supratherapeutic.
Outpatient [**Hospital1 **] Work Please have your INR drawn on Monday [**12-12**] Please have your INR and HCT drawn on Wednesday [**12-14**]  Please have these results faxed to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18702**] 3. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

)(s)* Refills:*2* 4. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual once a day as needed for chest pain: can take up to 3 tabs in 15 minutes.
Your HCT was 19 on admission and you were found to have a Gastrointestinal bleed.
A colonoscopy, upper endoscopy and small capsule study were conducted which revealed abnormal blood vessel dilations in the proximal jejunum but no sites of active bleeding.
Because you started levofloxacin, you need to closely monitor your INR as this drug can increase the effects of coumadin.
