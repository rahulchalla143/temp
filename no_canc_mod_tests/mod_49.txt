The patient's electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with ST elevations in Leads V2 and V3, otherwise the electrocardiogram was unchanged.
On examination, the patient had a blood pressure of 146/60, pulse of 135, pulse oxygenation 98% on 2 liters, was diffusely wheezy on respiratory examination, and was markedly diaphoretic, without jugular venous distention or edema.
The pulse oxygenation transiently fell to 88% on 5 liters face mask, and an arterial blood gas taken was 7.37/32/56.
A chest x-ray demonstrated increased congestive heart failure and the patient was given some nitro paste without effect, and then begun on nitroglycerin drip as well as additional lasix 80 mg intravenous push.
The patient rapidly thereafter clinically improved, with a blood pressure falling from a high in the 170s/80s to 135/76, with a normalization of respiratory rate and a pulse oxygenation of 92 to 95% on 6 liters, as well as over a liter of urine out ultimately, and a clearing of previous wheezing on examination.
The patient was again cycled with cardiac enzymes, which revealed a troponin elevated greater than the measurable range, likely from the prior cardiac events that were described in Dr.[**Name (NI) 2056**] dictation.
Additionally, the patient's blood pressure was better controlled with Captopril 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day, and the patient's Lopressor dose as well was increased to 50 mg by mouth three times a day with good effect on the patient's cardiac rate.
The patient's hematocrit continued to be stable for the remainder of this admission.
The patient was sent for echocardiography, which demonstrated an ejection fraction between 20 and 25%, with multiple wall motion abnormalities as described.
The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be between 20 and 25%.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Lasix 80 mg by mouth twice a day, Captopril 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day, Ambien 5 mg by mouth daily at bedtime as needed, Prevacid 30 mg by mouth twice a day, Timoptic 5% one drop to both eyes once daily, Xalatan one drop to both eyes once daily, NPH four units subcutaneously twice a day, regular insulin sliding scale, folate 1 mg by mouth once daily, Synthroid 25 mcg by mouth once daily, Plavix 75 mg by mouth once daily for 25 days (to complete a one month course), Lopressor 50 mg by mouth three times a day and hold for systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 100 or pulse less than or equal to 60), aspirin 81 mg by mouth once daily, levofloxacin 250 mg by mouth once daily for five days (to complete a ten day course), prednisone 50 mg by mouth once daily for four days then prednisone 40 mg by mouth once daily for four days then prednisone 30 mg by mouth once daily (this is the patient's baseline prednisone dose for her autoimmune hemolytic anemia).
