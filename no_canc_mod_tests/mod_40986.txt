At the OSH he had a CT head and torso and was intubated for airway protection.
A CBC showed WBC's of 20 with 5% bands.
Past Medical History: Per patient's sister, he had a "large stroke" in [**2142-4-26**] with residual R sided weakness.
Per his CT we can see this was a L MCA stroke.

His original labs at the OSH showed evidence of a new leukocytosis with a bandemia.
Our initial examination of Mr. [**Known lastname 17684**] is captured above (see Physical examination).
He was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics and received a lumbar puncture to investigate for possible CNS infections as being a cause for his new onset seizures.
The LP was unrevealing, and once all of his cultures and PCRs returned back negative, his antibiotics were discontinued.
At this time, he was continued on scheduled dilantin by IV and his levels were maintained in a therapeutic level.
While he was quite sleepy and confused during this first day, his mentation improved quickly such that by the next day, we were able to complete a full neurological examination which revealed some mild paraphasic errors and slow speech, but normal [**Location (un) 1131**] and comprehension, impaired short term memory, right sided visual loss, mild right sided pyramidal weakness and a relatively normal gait.
On repeat laboratory testing, we observed a new elevation in his liver function tests (particularly AST/ALT) which was initially thought to be secondary to dilantin toxicity.
He had received broad spectrum antibiotics earlier and out of concern for an antibiotic associated diarrhea, we sent for C diff toxin on his stool which returned negative.
