Admission Date: [**2111-10-30**]        Discharge Date: [**2111-11-15**]   Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 86-year-old female was admitted from [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital after cardiac catheterization on [**2111-10-30**].
Cardiac catheterization showed three-vessel disease.
b.i.d., Norvasc, Prilosec, Synthroid 125 mcg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 85, saturation of 99 percent on three liters nasal cannula, blood pressure 130/70 with a respiratory rate of 16.
LABORATORY DATA:  Cardiac catheterization showed a left main 75 percent lesion, a mid left anterior descending coronary artery lesion of 90 percent and totally occluded right coronary artery and a ramus lesion of 50 percent.
Preoperative labs are as follows:  Sodium 142, potassium 3.5, chloride 105, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.7 with a blood sugar of 110, hematocrit 39.1, PTT 26.9.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac echocardiogram and carotid ultrasounds were also ordered.
The first issue that had to be addressed was the patient became febrile and white blood cell count rose slightly.
This helped bring her blood pressures down.
On arrival, her blood pressure rose to 200/90.
Nitroglycerin drip helped to improve her blood pressure to the 130s systolic.
Prior to the groin bleeding, blood pressures systolic were 160/170 and dropped to 104/51.
CT scan was ordered to rule out also a retroperitoneal bleed.
White count did rise on [**2111-11-2**] preoperatively to 11.1 and then dropped to 7.4.
Blood cultures were pending.
Carotid ultrasounds were performed on [**2111-10-31**], which showed a 60-69 percent right internal carotid artery stenosis and a 40-60 percent left internal carotid artery stenosis.
The patient was also seen by the Infectious Disease consult team who recommended a full body scan for the patient's chest, abdomen and pelvis to look for any sources of her fever.
Fever workup continued on [**2111-11-3**].
H. pylori testing was sent off also.
Prior to surgery, urine cultures, blood cultures and RPR were all negative on the patient.
Abdominal scans did not reveal anything other than an incidental infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Chest CT showed some pulmonary nodules as read by Radiology.
Blood pressure 131/49.
Postoperative labs were as follows:  White blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 28.2, platelet count 160,000, sodium 146, chloride 112, bicarbonate 23, BUN 9, creatinine 0.7 with a blood sugar of 75.
The patient's saturation was 95-98 percent on three liters nasal cannula.
On postoperative day two, the patient received two units of packed red blood cells which brought her hematocrit up to 31.
Her chest tubes remained in place.
Hematocrit rose slightly to 33.2.
Creatinine remained stable at 0.8 with a potassium of 3.7.
Exam was unremarkable.
On postoperative day six, the patient was back in sinus rhythm with occasionally V-paced beats, blood pressure of 140/68, hemodynamically stable.
Her exam was unremarkable and she was remaining hemodynamically stable with saturation of 97 percent on room air.
The patient was discharge to home on [**2111-11-15**] with instructions for the VNA to draw blood for INR levels and to call the results to the patient's primary care physician.
This evening's dose of Coumadin, 1 mg for the evening of    discharge, 1 mg for post discharge day one on [**2111-11-14**]    and [**2111-11-15**], then INR check and call results to Dr.    [**Last Name (STitle) 57323**] for additional Coumadin dosing.
