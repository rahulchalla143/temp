The patient was noted to have recurrent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, noted by a CAT scan obtained by the patient's primary care physician.
The patient underwent an aortogram as well as cardiac catheterization in preparation for the surgery.
The aortogram revealed a tortuous thoracic aortic aneurysm as well as involvement in the abdominal aorta.
[**Initials (NamePattern5) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 32852**] 160 mg p.o.
Calcium with Vitamin D, 600 mg three times a day.
The patient's physical examination on admission to the hospital was unremarkable.
Chest x-ray showed severe aortic dilation and tortuosity with no acute pulmonary disease.
Ultimately, a sputum specimen grew out gram negative rods.
On postoperative day number three, due to copious secretions and gram negative rods, she had a bronchoscopy done at the bedside which revealed significant tracheobronchitis and increased secretions.
She was ultimately cardioverted from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm with 200 joules.
She had a repeat bronchoscopy which showed decreased secretions.
She underwent echo due to some worsening hypotension, which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 20% which was significantly decreased from her previous value of approximately 60.
She went to cardiac catheterization due to her new echocardiogram findings and this revealed only mild coronary artery disease.
She underwent another bronchoscopy on postoperative day number nine, [**6-13**], which revealed mild secretions.
She underwent another bronchoscopy which showed minimal secretions and no further evidence of tracheobronchitis.
She underwent CT scan of her abdomen, due to continued fever, which revealed hematoma at her graft site.
The patient was also noted to have profuse diarrhea that day and Clostridium difficile studies were sent, which ultimately returned as negative.
The following day, a repeat echocardiogram showed significant improvement in the left ventricular function, compared with her previous echocardiogram.
A bronchoscopy was performed upon reintubation which revealed minimal secretions.
She had an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis due to left arm swelling but both upper and lower ultrasounds were negative for deep vein thrombosis.
Her video swallow evaluation was obtained on [**7-10**], which she passed without any significant risk of aspiration.
The patient has no previous documented history of diabetes, she has had intermittent elevation of blood sugars.
A sliding scale should be as follows:  Blood glucose of 120 to 150 equal to three units subcutaneously; 150 to 200 equal to six units subcutaneously and 200 to 300 should equal nine units subcutaneously.
The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1290**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**], cardiac surgeon for follow-up postoperative check-up on discharge from rehabilitation facility.
The patient is discharged to rehabilitation care facility for further rehabilitation, increased activity and progression of oral intake.
