Admission Date:  [**2162-6-12**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2094-6-13**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] for workup of right-sided heart failure and evaluation for possible mitral valve replacement.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old male with an extensive cardiac history including CABG times three, mitral valve repair in [**2159**], ejection fraction 30-40%, [**2-1**]+ MR, [**3-2**]+ TR, dilated right and left atria and right ventricle, history of V tach arrest, now status post AICD placement, history of sick sinus syndrome, now status post pacer placement, pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, and chronic renal failure, who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2162-6-8**] complaining of nausea, vomiting, and increasing abdominal girth.
A CT of the abdomen showed abdominal ascites with pooling of IV contrast in the right heart and IVC.
Paracentesis here withdrew 750 cc of transudative fluid.
The TTE was performed on [**2162-6-14**] and was mostly consistent with the TEE findings as will be described below except that the mitral regurgitation was qualified as 3+ and the tricuspid regurgitation was 4+.
The TEE was performed on [**2162-6-15**] and showed a markedly dilated right atrium, dilated right ventricle, [**12-31**]+ MR, 2+ TR, markedly dilated left atrium, severely depressed left ventricular function, and a well-seated mitral valve ring.
As part of the preoperative workup, the patient was sent to undergo cardiac catheterization.
During that cardiac catheterization the patient was found to have elevated bilateral filling pressures.
Measurements were taken pre and post milrinone with the following results listed respectively:  Cardiac output 3.88, 4.31; cardiac index 1.77 and 1.9; pulmonary capillary wedge pressures 33 and 28; pulmonary artery pressure 60/32 and 50/25; right atrial pressure 25 and 21; left ventricular ejection fraction was found to be 37% with 4+ MR.
At the time of this dictation, Surgery evaluation is still ongoing and the final treatment option for this patient has not been decided upon.
Cardiac catheterization in [**11-30**], during which the patient's left main underwent rotational atherectomy and PTCA with stent placement, slowly with evidence of competitive flow, midvessel, after takeoff.
Chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.3.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.6, pulse 66, V paced, blood pressure 103/61, respiratory rate 15, oxygen saturation 91% on 2 liters, pulmonary artery pressure 52/27 with a mean of 36, cardiac output 4.1, cardiac index 1.2.
PERTINENT DATA ON TRANSFER TO CCU:  Hematocrit 33.3, INR 1.6, creatinine 1.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In addition to the above described in the history of the present illness, it should be noted that on a CAT scan performed at an outside hospital there is evidently a small mass on one of the patient's kidneys which will need further evaluation after the patient's acute episodes are resolved.
His Plavix and Coumadin were held in anticipation of surgery and heparin was not started as the patient was maintaining an INR of 1.6 to 1.8 on his own.
