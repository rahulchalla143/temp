Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: 1.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted [**5-22**] to [**Hospital1 1444**] and was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where he is found to have a 90 percent left main stenosis, diffuse left circumflex disease, a 50 percent ostial RCA lesion, ejection fraction of 65 percent.
However, it was noted that the patient's platelet count had dropped to 25,000.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibodies were sent, which was subsequently negative.
It was felt that the thrombocytopenia was possibly due to the intra-aortic balloon pump; that Hematology team looked at a peripheral smear, which was not suggestive of DIC or TTP, and patient's platelet count subsequently began to increase without any platelet transfusions.
Patient was started on IV amiodarone and low-dose Lopressor, and subsequently converted into sinus rhythm less than 12 hours later.
Patient's hematocrit was 25, and patient was given packed red blood cell transfusion with good response.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  T max 98.7, pulse 80 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 114/64, respiratory rate 20, and on room air oxygen saturation 93 percent.
Patient's weight on [**5-31**] was 87.2 kg.
Laboratory data:  White blood cell count 11.0, hematocrit 30.8, platelet count 120.
Sodium 137, potassium 3.8, chloride 95, bicarb 31, BUN 24, creatinine 1.0, glucose 105.
