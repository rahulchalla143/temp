During his [**2188-4-4**] Medical Intensive Care Unit admission, stress echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization were performed to rule out ischemia as a cause of low O2 saturations.
The stress echocardiogram showed anterior abnormalities and the cardiac catheterization showed mild to moderate coronary artery disease with no flow limiting lesions; normal filling pressures, left ventricular ejection fraction equal to 55%.
EMS arrived on the scene and his O2 saturation was 70%.
In the Emergency Department, his O2 saturation was 84% on nonrebreather with respiratory rate equal to 44.
Blood pressure 120/palp and heart rate equal to 132.
His chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
His electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block which was intermittently seen on prior electrocardiograms during his [**2188-4-4**] admission.
His arterial blood gases was equal to 6.29/87/502 after intubation.
His blood pressure dropped to 68/palp and the patient was then begun on Levophed 4 mg/kg/minute and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Initial laboratories on admission include:  White blood cell count 12.9, 58% neutrophils, 32% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes and 3% eosinophils.
Hematocrit equal to 47.1, platelet count 304,000, PT equal to 14.4, PTT 31.9, INR 1.4.
Electrolytes: Sodium was 143, potassium 4.9, chloride 103, bicarbonate 24, BUN 15, creatinine 1.1, glucose 192.
Repeat arterial blood gas was 7.17/54/363.
All CKs were less than 200.
All CK-MBs were less than 10 and initial troponin was less than 0.3.
Urinalysis was negative.
Coronary artery disease - ejection fraction equal to 55% in [**2188-4-4**], 1+ mitral regurgitation, hypokinetic basal half of the anterior septum and anterior wall on stress echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization showed 40% occlusion of the mid left anterior descending, 40% occlusion of the mid circumflex, 20% occlusion of the left main with a normal proximal left anterior descending and normal septal branches.
Heart rate 131.
Blood pressure 118/61 (off pressors).
Oxygen saturation was 100% on assist control with FIO2 of 60%, total volume 600 and rate of 12.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Pupils are constricted bilaterally, both reactive, right pupil approximately 1 mm, left was approximately 3 mm.
He did require three, one liter boluses for systolic blood pressures in the 70s.
He was found to be prerenal as per FeNA calculation 0.11% and the patient received D5 normal saline at 150 cc an hour for a low urine output on [**9-24**], which is about 20 cc per hour throughout the day.
The patient's urine output picked up to 40 cc per hour with hydration.
Follow-up chest x-ray on [**9-25**] showed clear lungs, no effusions and no congestive heart failure.
It was decided not to start a beta-blocker due to the patient's significant bronchoreactivity.
Possibly consider beginning a calcium channel blocker as an outpatient, as the patient's blood pressure tolerates.
His fingersticks remained within normal limits.
Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit trended down from 47.1 on admission to 34.3 at time of discharge.
Rectal exam showed guaiac negative stools.
Sputum showed moderate oropharyngeal flora, likely not a good sample.
Blood cultures have been negative to date.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient is currently on a cardiac diet as tolerated and we are encouraging po intake.
