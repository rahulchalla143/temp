DISCHARGE LAB: =========================================== IMAGING: ECG - [**2101-9-15**]: Sinus rhythm at upper limits of normal rate.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2101-9-15**] the rate is slower.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2101-9-19**] there is loss of precordial R wave which could be due to lead placement.
CXR [**2101-9-15**]: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2101-9-15**]: 1.
CT head [**2101-9-18**]: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
In addition, CT can be less sensitive in the detection of early cerebral edema- correlate clinically.
CXR [**2101-9-19**]: Poorly placed ET tube.
CT torso [**2101-9-19**]: 1.
Still, non contrast CT is not sensitive for detection of acute bowel ischemia and this cannot be excluded.
EEG [**2101-9-20**]: This continuous recording revealed a moderately severe to severe diffuse encephalopathy initially with some focal features in the right central area admixed with multifocal interictal epileptiform activity and short duration bursts of semi-rhythmic epileptiform activity, the latter in the right frontal central region.
MRI head [**2101-9-20**]: 1.
Limited evaluation for a seizure focus secondary to lack of IV contrast.
No cortical abnormality in right frontal lobe, suggesting that the suspected finding on the previous CT was secondary to volume averaging artifact.
EEG [**2101-9-21**]: This EEG continues to give evidence for a moderately severe to severe diffuse encephalopathy with background slowing into the theta bandwidth with considerable admixed delta activity and some increased laterality to the slowing over the right central temporal region, the latter suggesting there may be a structural component in addition to the encephalopathic changes.
CXR [**2101-9-21**]: 1.
EEG [**2101-9-22**]: This EEG gives evidence for what appears to be a moderate to moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy.
CXR [**2101-9-23**]: In comparison with the study of [**9-21**], there is no evidence of acute pneumonia at this time.
================================== MICROBIOLOGY BCx multiple blood cultures all negative [**2101-9-16**] fecal culture negative for salmonella, shigella, EHEC, ova/parasite, campylobacter, yersinia and c diff toxin [**2101-9-19**] MRSA screen positive, one negative MRSA screen afterwards [**2101-9-19**] UCx negative [**2101-9-26**] c diff toxin negative [**2101-10-10**] c diff (-)  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 63242**] is a 47 y/o F with ESRD on HD, schizoaffective d/o who initially presented on [**2101-9-15**] with bloody diarrhea.
CT scan performed on day of admission showed evidence of colitis and portal venous air.
Wbc in the 20s.
Given concern for ischemic bowel, taken to surgery where an exploratory laparoscopy was performed.
CT head and MRI without focal findings.
Per psych recs, the patient's psychiatric medications were again taken off to clarify the MS picture.
Patient declined a CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism, though the index of suspicion was quite low given that the patient had no shortness of breath, hypoxia and had been on propylactic heparin.
Underwent ex-lap due to concern regarding ischemic bowel although no ischemia was found and no intervention was made.
Multiple C. Diff toxin assays sent and were negative.
The catheter tip and blood cultures, however remained negative.
RUE US was obtained that showed a patent graft and dermatology believed the rash was simply contact dermatitis.
RUE US was obtained that showed a patent graft and dermatology believed the rash was simply contact dermatitis.
Patient was fluid restricted to 1200 mL daily, however, pt was not always adherent to this restriction and sodium levels fluctuated.
Examination revealed a 2x3cm lesion.
Patient instructed to make OB/Gyn appointment as an outpatient for further evaluation of this abscess.
After she was transferred to the medicine floor, repeat CXR was done without evidence of any pneumonia, so cefepime/vancomycin were stopped.
