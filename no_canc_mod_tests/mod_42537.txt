# Hypertension: As per previous notes, Mr. [**Known lastname 104319**] baseline SBP is 150-170.
The exacerbating factor for this episode is unclear, but his blood pressures were better post hemodialysis and after being on a nitroglycerin drip in the MICU.
- We did consider increasing his lisinopril dose, but at the time of discharge, his blood pressure was in the 130s systolic.
It was determined that his ECG and clinical picture were not consistent with ACS.
A recent pMIBI with negative stress and imaging showing fixed inferior wall defect and no reversible defects.
His head CT was without abnormality and he had a non-focal neurologic exam.
At that time, you should have your blood pressure checked.
