During that admission he underwent an echo which revealed severe aortic stenosis.

Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 40 mm Hg.
Left ventricular filling pressure was elevated (LVEDP 30 mm Hg).
Imaging of the IVC showed an occlusion proximal to the iliac bifurcation, with extensive collaterals.
The occlusion appeared to be recanalized, suggesting an old thrombus.
LV systolic fxn is moderately depressed, with inferior, septal and lateral HK, apical AK.
MR remains trace - 1+.
The LV systolic fxn is moderately depressed, with EF still 35 - 40 %.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Conclusions Pre-CPB: The study is limited by very poor windows and images.
LV systolic fxn is moderately depressed, with inferior, septal and lateral HK, apical AK.
MR remains trace - 1+.
The LV systolic fxn is moderately depressed, with EF still 35 - 40 %.
He underwent pre-operative work-up which included echo, carotid u/s, CT and hepatology consult d/t alcohol history.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
