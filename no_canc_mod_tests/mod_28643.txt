On arrival to the [**Hospital3 **] ED, the pt was only responsive to painful stimuli and her SBP had decreased into the 60s and 70s.

Urine tox screen was negative.
Pt was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

- over [**2034-12-28**], pt HR and BP stabilized, with levophed off at 3 am on [**12-30**] - weaned off glucagon drip yesterday [**12-30**] - off Ca gluconate gtt as hypercalcemic on [**12-30**] -> receiving NS, which brought Ca from 18 to 10 - EKGs stable over last 12 hours - extubated successfully yesterday morning - will add valium q6 as pt will need it for agitation and per psych recommendations - LFTs and labs stable over last 2 days - Concern for propranolol for seizures given its high lipophilicity.
Will give IV benzos if seizes -> no seizures thus far, and it has been 48 hours since overdose, so likelihood for seizures is very low - pt medically stable, and will benefit from an inpatient psych admission with evaluation and treatment of bipolar disorder .
