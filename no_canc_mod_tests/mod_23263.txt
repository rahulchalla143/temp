CHEST X-RAY (PORTABLE AP) ([**2166-10-22**]):  FINDINGS: Bibasal atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
The right lower lobe consolidation with air bronchogram is noted, may represent atelectasis, but infectious process would be another possibility, close followup is required.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient initially presented to the emergency room for evaluation of his severe epigastric/abdominal pain, where laboratory values were consistent with recurrent pancreatitis.
Although the patient was asymptomatic and denied chest pain/dizziness, an EKG was obtained which demonstrated sinus rhythm.
His pain improved and urine output was good.
By hospital day 2 his heart rate had improved and decreased from the 140's to the low 100's - sinus rhythm - and his pain was reported to be improved.
On exam the patient was noted to have some crackles in his lung fields bilaterally, and due to concern for possible fluid-overload or pulmonary edema, IV fluids were discontinued and a chest X-ray was obtained.
The chest X-ray did demonstrate some evidence of fluid overload and mild bilateral pleural effusions, however he continued to have good oxygen saturation and diuresed well.
The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in one month's time following discharge, during which time he will also undergo a Secretin MRCP for further evaluation of his pancreatic dysfunction.
Pancreatic divisum 2.
