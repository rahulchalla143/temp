She was then transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for cardiac catheterization.
Catheterization was done on [**2140-12-7**], and showed an ejection fraction of 45%, left main coronary artery was normal, left anterior descending artery was totally occluded at the ostium, left circumflex artery had a mid 90% tubular lesion, ramus intermedius had an 80% proximal lesion, her right coronary artery showed mild disease, right posterior descending artery was with mild proximal disease.
q.d., Insulin 70/30 7 U in the morning, 5 U in the evening, Lipitor dose unknown 1 q.d.
Vital signs:  Heart rate 74, blood pressure 174/80, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L nasal cannula.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 6.7, hematocrit 37%, platelet count 250,000; potassium 2.6, sodium 141, BUN 16, creatinine 0.8, troponin 9.22.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass times of 61 min and a cross-clamp time of 51 min.
Also throughout the operative night, her epinephrine drip was weaned off, and had to go on and off her Nitroglycerin and Nipride drip for blood pressure control.
By postoperative day #2, the drainage from her chest tubes had decreased, and they were discharge without incident.
She was then seen by Cardiology who felt that she should have urgent cardiac catheterization to evaluate her graft.
The results of that cardiac catheterization showed that she did have patent grafts with elevated filling pressures and a low cardiac output.
Cardiac echocardiogram was then recommended.
A Neurology consult was obtained, and an MRI with diffusion weighted images was recommended.
Her carotid ultrasound was done and was a normal study with no plaque seen in the antegrade to the pupils.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Stable, heart rate 62, blood pressure 134/68, respirations 20, oxygen saturation 94%.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA:  They will be dictated in an addendum, along with her discharge chest x-ray.
for 7 days, Insulin 70/30 7 U every morning, 5 U each evening, regular Insulin sliding scale.
