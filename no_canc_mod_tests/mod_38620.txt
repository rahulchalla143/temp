No small bowel transition point is seen to suggest a mechanical bowel obstruction, and any component of partial obstruction is likely to be functional as the result of inflammation.
No CT signs of vasculitis of the abdominal vessels and no arterial or venous occlusion.
Would recommend against increasing steroid therapy for now given the concern and high likelihood for C.diff colitis, unless histologic evaluation appears otherwise.
CT demonstrated bowel wall thickening suggestive of colitis.
Of note, azathioprine, which she had been on for lupus treatment, was transiently held.
Subsequently the patient pulled her foley catheter and repeat post-void residual measurement revealed <100cc residual on multiple repeat measurements.
