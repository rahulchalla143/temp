[**2129-9-26**] (on transfer to CCU post-catheterization): EKG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with PR prolongation, occasional dropped beats and intermittent pacing.
TTE ([**2129-9-26**]): There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**9-2**] demonstrated: COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed three-vessel disease: --The LMCA had a distal taper with 60% stenosis and modest calcification.
Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA to be widely patent.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal left-sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 12 mmHg.
Systemic arterial systolic and [**Month/Year (2) 7216**] pressures were normal.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow (see PTCA comments).
Cardiac catheterization [**9-26**], with LAD stenting and D1 POBA.
CT scan [**9-26**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
#) CAD with unstable angina: EKG showed findings potentially consistent with inferior wall ischemia.
Given the EKG changes and persistent CP, heparin drip was started.
His isosorbide mononitrate was increased to 120 mg daily with blood pressure paramaters.
We narrowed his blood pressure medicine for discharge somewhat given the possibility that his bradycardia and hypotension may have been related to a failure to be able to compensate peripherally for a vagal episode.
#) Bradycardia with hypotension: As noted above, he had a brief period of rapid-onset bradycardia and hypotension immediately after his catheterization procedure.
We judged this to be most likely the result of a vagal effect combined with labetalol/diltiazem/nifedipine which did not allow for compensatory BP and PVR rise.
#) Hyperkalemia - In addition to his bradycardia and hypotension, Mr [**Known lastname 7203**] was found to have a potassium of greater than 7 in this post-procedure time.
This was likely secondary ESRD combined with transient poor perfusion preventing kidneys from excreting even the small amount of potassium which they generally contribute.
#) Congestive heart failure, [**Hospital1 7216**], grade II: Mr [**Known lastname 7203**] was clinically mildly overloaded by exam on arrival, with crackles at his lung bases.
The stent will help make sure that blood flows through this artery.
