At the outside hospital the patient was noted to have elevated in troponin to 4.8 and EKG changes such as elevations in inferior leads.
Transesophageal echocardiogram showed ejection fraction at 30% to 35% with prior study of [**2182-6-1**], noting ejection fraction of 50% to 55%.
She was heparinized and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for catheterization and further management.
On presentation, the catheterization was consistent with cardiogenic shock, notable for 95% stenosis in the proximal LAD, 70% stenosis in the lateral circumflex, with a right dominant system.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on presentation revealed the vital signs as follows:  temperature 96.8, heart rate 87 to 113 and irregular, blood pressure 110/61 to 95/54, breathing at 24, saturation 94% on four liters.
HEENT: Examination was remarkable for positive JVD, heart irregularly irregular, S1 and S2 no rubs, gallops, or murmurs.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Examination was difficult to assess.
EKG on presentation was notable for atrial fibrillation at 107 beats per minute with a right axis deviation, normal intervals, 1.5-mm ST elevations in leads 2, 3, and AVF; 0.5 -mm ST depressions in 1 and AVL.
Chest x-ray was notable for left lower lobe opacity and perihilar infiltrates.
Recommendations:  CT abdomen and pelvis, optimizing hemodynamic parameters.
MICU evaluation was obtained.
From [**2183-9-25**] to [**2183-9-26**], the patient experienced a rising white count from 20 to 33, respiratory requirements worsened.
Serum lactic acid levels rose to a high of 12.4 likely due to ischemic valve secondary to hypoperfusion.
