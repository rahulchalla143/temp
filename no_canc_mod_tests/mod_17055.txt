Admission Date: [**2192-9-6**]        Discharge Date:[**2193-1-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-6-17**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CSU   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 49 year old man transferred from [**Hospital6 33180**] after a transesophageal echocardiogram showed aortic valve endocarditis with aortic insufficiency and a cath done at that time immediately following showed no flow limiting coronary artery disease.
LABORATORY DATA:  Lab data at the time of transfer: White count 28.7, hematocrit 36, platelets 395,000.
PT 16, PTT 29, INR 1.8.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.4, no chloride or CO2, BUN 83, creatinine 4.3, glucose 180.
ABG 7.32, 39, 85, 21/-5 with vent settings of assist control 100%, tidal volume 600, respiratory rate 22 with no pressor support and 10 of PEEP.
Chest x-ray done on admission showed bilateral pleural effusions without pneumothorax or infiltrates and endotracheal tube in good position.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 99.4, heart rate 100, sinus tach, blood pressure 136/39, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 100%.
It was planned to place a Swan-Ganz catheter and then send the patient to CAT scan for an abdominal and a chest CT to look for septic sources and to rule out PE, however, upon arrival in the CSIU, the patient had a VT arrest.
He was shocked several times and returned to a normal sinus rhythm following which he did go to CAT scan and had a repeat TEE at that time.
His postoperative course was extremely unstable and on the [**12-19**], he had a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severe aortic regurgitation with a vegetation of the aortic valve and 2+ mitral regurgitation without vegetations on the mitral valve.
He also had exploratory laparotomy at that time that showed mesenteric ischemia and abdominal hematoma was also evacuated at that time.
Culture material sent from the operating room ultimately grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] from the pericardial tissue as well as from the chest wound and aortic tissue.
The patient had a limited sternal debridement as well as a chest washout during that trip to the operating room.
He tolerated that operation well and was returned to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit where he remained hemodynamically stable for about a week and subsequently on the [**11-29**], he had an episode of bleeding which returned him to the operating room for a mediastinal exploration during which they found a dehiscence of suture line and an infected initial homograft.
Additionally, the patient had further sternal debridement as well as an omental flap brought up to the sternal space at that time.
The patient again arrested on [**11-4**], following acute exsanguination from his chest which was open at the time, however, the omental flap was taken down, was placed on ECMO in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit, then brought to the operating room where he was put on bypass and he had a repair of his aortic homograft where it was found that he had dehisced 1 of his suture line.
His most recent chest x-ray shows no infiltrates with a small right effusion.
Cardiac status, status post multiple aortic surgeries with the last surgery being an attempt at sternal closure and that was done on [**11-19**], following which his sternal wound was left with an omental flap and a VAX dressing to allow for secondary closure.
Abdomen, the patient had an exploratory laparotomy which was initially done [**10-7**].
His most recent BUN and creatinine are 57 and 2.7 with a sodium of 143 and a potassium of 4.1.
From an infectious disease standpoint, the patient's last white blood cell count is 6.6.
His blood cultures from the [**12-31**] are pending.
His urine culture from the [**1-5**] is negative.
Blood cultures from the 17th are no growth to date.
At that time, his TSH was 9.6 with a T4 of 7.7, T3 of 100, T uptake of 1.28, T4 index of 9.9 and free T4 of 1.6.
The patient's physical exam at the time of dictation: Vitals: Temperature 99.9, heart rate 114, sinus tach, blood pressure 100/60, respiratory rate 34 on trach collar of 40%, saturation is 100%.
Lab data: White count 6.6, hematocrit 25.5, platelets 218,000.
Sodium 143, potassium 4.1, chloride 101, CO2 of 25, BUN 57, creatinine 2.7, glucose 92.
