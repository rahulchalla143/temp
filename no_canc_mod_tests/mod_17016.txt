No further evidence of a PDA has been noted and no further imaging studies have been performed.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition: The infant was initially maintained n.p.o.
The infant was noted to have hypoglycemia on admission to the NICU but this resolved with initiation of IV fluid and blood sugars have been normal since that time.
Electrolytes on day of life 16 included a sodium of 136, potassium of 4.6, chloride of 107 and bicarbonate of 22.
Our plan was to check a set of electrolytes along with nutritional laboratory studies of calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase on day of life 34.
The infant has maintained normal urine and stool output throughout.
Peak bilirubin was 6.1 on day of life 3.
Heme: Initial hematocrit was 50.8.
Last hematocrit was measured on day of life 17 and this was 40.
Of note, initial CBC at the time of delivery revealed a white count of 4.0, with 20% polys, consistent with mild neutropenia.
A repeat CBC on day of life 2 showed a white cell count of 5.5 with 40% polys, within normal range.
ID: CBC and blood culture were sent on admission.
The infant was treated with 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin that were then discontinued with negative blood cultures and benign clinical course.
Blood cx was negative and symptoms resolved, and course was not thought consistent with omphalitis.
Head ultrasound on day of life 6 and again on day of life 31 was normal.
Initial eye exam was performed on day of life 24 and this revealed immature retina in zone 2 bilaterally with follow up recommended in 2 weeks; this would be approximately [**2190-6-1**].
RHCM: Newborn screens were sent on [**4-27**], and [**5-9**].
