An electrocardiogram was done that revealed ST elevations in the inferior leads.
She was premedicated with Solu-Medrol and Benadryl due to a suspected allergy to contrast and sent to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
A transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2139-6-26**] demonstrated an ejection fraction of 65% with 1+ mitral regurgitation and delayed relaxation of left ventricular inflow.
Her current chest pressure had completely resolved upon arrival to [**Hospital1 69**] where she was taken straight to the catheterization laboratory.
Cardiac catheterization showed normal left main coronary artery with 20% ostial left anterior descending artery, normal right coronary artery, 30% proximal left circumflex, 30% first obtuse marginal.
Of note, during the cardiac catheterization the femoral artery was unable to be cannulated, and a right radial approach was necessary.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Temperature of 98, blood pressure of 162/82, heart rate of 81, respiratory rate of 12, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed jugular venous pressure was not appreciated.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally and anteriorly; unable to assess posterior lung fields.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission revealed a white blood cell count of 11.9, hemoglobin of 11.9, hematocrit of 33.9, platelets of 140.
Chemistry revealed a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.9, chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 20, blood urea nitrogen of 49, creatinine of 1.9, blood glucose of 23, with an anion gap of 18.
PT of 14.8, PTT of 150, INR of 1.5.
Initial arterial blood gas was 7.39/43/66/23.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram done on admission pain free revealed 2-mm to 3-mm ST elevations in the inferior lead with ST depressions in V2 through V4, aVL; all new compared to electrocardiogram dated [**2139-6-30**].
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and showed a peak creatine phosphokinase at 7 a.m. after admission at 1306, CK/MB of 84, and an index of 6.4, with a troponin of greater than 50.
All cardiac enzyme markers trended downward for the remainder of the hospital course.
Lipids were checked on hospital day four, and the patient was found to have an low-density lipoprotein of 95; and therefore Lipitor was stopped.
The patient's blood pressure at the time of discharge was 130/78.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed on [**2140-7-10**] which showed an ejection fraction of 35%, hypokinesis of basal inferolateral walls consistent with systolic dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells during her hospital course for a hematocrit fall from a hematocrit of 31 with concern over excessive bleeding from central line sites.
The patient's glucose was well controlled during her hospital course with a maximum fingerstick not greater than 150.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  On hospital day four, the patient had four loose stools in the morning due to concern for Clostridium difficile toxin, an assay was sent which came back negative.
