Prior history is significant for an episode of syncope in [**12/2107**], which lead to an extensive evaluation which included a positive stress test for ischemia in the anteroseptal and inferoseptal walls.
Carotid CTA revealed severe R ICA (>80%), stenosis (soft plaque proxi-[**Last Name (un) **] and calcified distally that starts about 1 cm distal to the bifurcation, R vertebral occlusion.)
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2108-3-6**] and underwent Cardiac Catheterization, and was found to have significant 3VD.

The patient was transferred post procedurally for close monitoring for hemodynamic parameters and neurologic signs.
His BP stabilized to 120s/70s and remained stable overnight.
His pressures remained largely in the 120s/70s for the duration of his stay in the ICU.
He was sent home on his home medications with instructions to notify his physician if his SBP are greater than 140. .
