On presentation to [**Hospital3 17310**], she was in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.3; preoperatively, it was 1.4.
She was found to have a leukocytosis and spiked a temperature within 12 hours of presentation.
Her chest x-ray looked markedly worsened and she began to spike high fevers,and was hypotensive again requiring pressors to keep her blood pressure in the 80s to 90s.
Hepatitis B positive.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient had a temperature of 100.7?????
?F, a blood pressure of 108/62, a MAP of 79-80, a heart rate of 118-120, respirations of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 99%.
Her vent settings were assist control with tidal volume of 400, respiratory rate of 20, PEEP of 20, FiO2 of 90%, PIP of 35-40 and plateau of 24-25.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, the head was normocephalic and atraumatic.
Her groin showed a moist, erythematous rash in the intertriginous region with a mild amount of yellow exudate at the right groin.
On neurological examination, the patient was sedated but otherwise the examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the patient had a white blood cell count of 19,200, hemoglobin of 10.2, hematocrit of 31.9 and platelet count of 147,000.
Prothrombin time was 13.6, partial thromboplastin time was 30.4 and INR was 1.2.
There was an AST of 19, ALT of 14, CK of 46, alkaline phosphatase of 100 and total bilirubin of 0.2.
There was a sodium of 149, potassium of 4.7, chloride of 114, bicarbonate of 26, BUN of 43, creatinine of 1.2 and glucose of 146.
Calcium was 8.2, albumin was 3.0, phosphate was 4.3 and magnesium was 2.2.
RADIOLOGY DATA:  On a CT angiogram with contrast done on [**2120-7-4**], there was no pulmonary embolism noted.
A ventilation perfusion scan was done on [**2120-7-12**].
Bilateral lower extremity Doppler studies done on [**2120-7-9**] showed a partially occlusive clot involving the left common femoral vein.
CARDIAC STUDIES:  An echocardiogram done on [**2120-7-8**] showed the left atrium to be mildly dilated.
The overall left ventricular systolic function was normal with an ejection fraction of over 55%.
Her ventilator settings were a PEEP of 20, an FiO2 of 1.0, a PIP of 40 and a plateau of 35.
An echocardiogram done did not reveal evidence of right heart strain and a CT angiogram on [**2120-7-4**] did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism.
The chest x-ray initially showed evidence of pneumonia, probably secondary to aspiration.
Her chest x-rays continued to worsen initially during her hospital admission and she was thought to have respiratory failure secondary to adult respiratory distress syndrome.
Her current ventilator settings are a pressure support of 16 with a PEEP of 10, a tidal volume of 600 and a respiratory rate of 15-17.
After that time, her blood pressure was stable and she did not require further pressors.
Her blood cultures were all initially negative.
Vancomycin was started on [**2120-7-9**] for a positive blood culture from a central line.
She developed bacteremia again on [**2120-7-22**] with blood culture positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus.
A nasogastric lavage was negative.
Her hematocrit was closely monitored while she was here and she did not require further transfusions.
Her hematocrit continued to be stable.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Her electrolytes were monitored closely here and were repleted as needed.
