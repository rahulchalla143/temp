At that time, the patient reported that her chest pain was [**10-26**] in severity.
Her hematocrit was revealed to be 28 and a Swan-Ganz catheter showed low right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed the patient's temperature was 95.3 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 71, her blood pressure was 127/61, her respiratory rate was 18, and her oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Distal pedal pulses were intact.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient followed commands.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data on admission revealed her white blood cell count was 10.6, her hematocrit was 36.7, and her platelets were 326.
Mean cell volume was 92.
Her sodium was 134, potassium was 4, chloride was 93, bicarbonate was 27.7, blood urea nitrogen was 22, creatinine was 1.1, and blood glucose was 119.
Her calcium was 9.1.
Her magnesium was 1.9.
Her albumin was 3.8.
Her ALT was 58.
Troponin was 0.3.
Creatine phosphokinase was 48.
Her INR was 1.2.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 60.
A chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia or congestive heart failure with mild cardiomegaly.
The patient's initial cardiac catheterization was unsuccessful for any intervention and was complicated by a retroperitoneal bleed.
The patient underwent a Persantine MIBI on [**9-7**]; during which the patient had [**5-26**] chest pressure and chest pain with the infusion, but no electrocardiogram changes.
The MIBI portion revealed moderate partially reversible defects involving the mid and lateral wall which extended to the apex and a hypokinetic lateral wall, with an ejection fraction of 62%.
The patient was to undergo a repeat cardiac catheterization on [**9-10**] with a planned intervention at that time.
RETROPERITONEAL BLEED ISSUES:  After the multiple access attempts during the patient's initial cardiac catheterization the patient's hematocrit dropped, and she became hypotensive.
The patient underwent an urgent abdominal and pelvic computerized axial tomography which revealed a large left-sided retroperitoneal hematoma in the pelvis, diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, and no evidence of bowel obstruction.
The patient was transfused with two units of packed red blood cells, and her hematocrit was followed serially.
After several days, her hematocrit was found to be stable in the low 30s.
In addition, a repeat abdominal computed tomography on [**9-4**] revealed a greatly decreased left pelvic wall hematoma.
At this point, the patient's retroperitoneal bleed was felt to have resolved, and the patient's hematocrit was felt to be stable.
The decision was made to proceed with cardiac catheterization on [**2181-9-10**].
The patient's ACE inhibitor was discontinued as was her daily nitrate in order to maintain her systolic blood pressure around 100.
The patient's urine culture revealed greater than 100,000 colonies of Escherichia coli which was pan-sensitive.
