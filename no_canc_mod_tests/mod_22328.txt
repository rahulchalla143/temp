His blood pressure remained in the 70s.
He was found to have a flail chest on both sides and he was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
He had a flail chest and crepitus on the right side.
Rectal exam - decreased tone and guaiac negative.
Upon arrival, the patient had a heart rate of 110 with blood pressure of 70 systolic, sating around 90 percent.
PERTINENT LABS:  Upon arrival, the patient's white blood cell count was 12.5, hematocrit 30.2, PT 16.4, PTT 53.8, INR 1.7, fibrinogen 1.8.
Sodium was 143, potassium 3.9, chloride 110, bicarb 22, glucose 264, BUN 13, creatinine 1.3, amylase 92, lactate of 7.5, calcium 8.8.
His first gas was 7.13, 47, 115, 17, -13.
The patient started receiving blood products, initially untyped blood followed by FFP, platelets and cryoprecipitate which improved his blood pressure to 120s- 140s and heart rate decreased down to 80s.
At the same time, given distended abdomen, a DPL was performed which was essentially negative.
At that time, the patient again improved his blood pressure to 120s-140s with normal heart rate.
Given seemingly hemodynamic stability, the Interventional Radiology attending wished to attempt a CT scan before proceeding to angio.
A quick scan of the chest and abdomen was performed that revealed still a pneumothorax on the left side.
At that point, the patient started dropping his saturations down to 80s.
Another chest tube with a 6- French was placed in the CT Suite.
At the same time, the right chest tube which was still functional and was in place by way of CT scan, started putting out more bloody discharge which had then totalled about 1 liter in 6 hours.
The CT scan revealed, as above, persistent pneumothorax on the left which was fixed with another chest tube, hemothorax on the right with significant bilateral contusions.
The patient had an angio which revealed slight bleeding from the right lower pole of the kidney which was embolized.
The patient was brought into Intensive Care Unit where his temperature was found to be 88.
A new set of labs was sent which showed continuous coagulopathy and anemia with a hematocrit of 20.
The patient continued to receive red blood cells, platelets, FFP and fibrinogen.
Temperature was coming up with AV rewarming, although it was getting continuously more difficult to ventilate the patient.
A chest x-ray done emergently revealed no significant pneumothorax, but significant bilateral contusions, edema as well as the fluid overload.
