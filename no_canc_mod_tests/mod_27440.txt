If there is concern for cholecystitis, further evaluation with a HIDA scan could also be considered.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
[**2175-5-15**] CT CHEST: 1.
Follow-up CT after treatment for bacterial infection may be considered, if warranted clinically.
[**2175-5-15**] CT SINUS: Mild-moderate degree of mucosal thickening is seen within the maxillary sinuses bilaterally, sphenoid sinuses, and ethmoid sinuses, with aerosolized secretions in the left maxillary sinus.
[**2175-5-16**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
[**2175-5-23**] transjugular liver biopsy: 1.
Trichrome stain shows prominent sinusoidal fibrosis (see note).
RESULTS: Three-color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.
T-lymphocytes do not show any antigenic aberrancy.
[**2175-6-3**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
Evaluation of the colon is limited  as it is not filled with oral contrast, and surrounding pericolonic fat is obscured by ascites.
Upon presentation, the patient was febrile daily with temps 100-102, however serial blood, urine, sputum and stool cultures were generally unremarkable, with the exception of sputum culture [**2175-5-18**] which showed 2+ GPC, GPR, however sample quality was poor, and culture was negative.
The patient was ruled out for TB with sputum cx x 3.
CMV and EBV viral load were negative.
HepC viral load was 55 million.
The patient was treated with a 7 day course of zosyn [**Date range (1) 72852**] upon presentation because of coarse breath sounds, and fever, however CT CHEST revealed only ground glass opacification at bases, but no clear infiltrate.
The patient underwent HIDA [**2175-5-17**] which showed no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Liver biopsy was performed on [**2175-5-23**] via transjugular approach.
KOH prep revealed budding yeast, and pathology specimens demonstrated yeast, however culture data was unremarkable.
Bone marrow biopsy was obtained on [**2175-5-22**] which was unremarkable.
Serum crypto, urine histo, and fungal blood cultures were negative.
On [**6-2**] repeat HIV viral load was >100,000, decision was made to continue to defer restarting HAART, while awaiting HIV genotype information (pt's prior HIV regimen of trisovir/kaletra was felt to be atypical).
The patient had been started on MAC treatment [**2-17**] liver biopsy in [**11-21**] which was AFB positive on smear, however no cultures had been sent.
Upon admission to OSH, pt had AST 265, ALT 108, AP 188, TB 1.6.
His LFTs continued to rise, and peaked after transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-15**] ALT 150 AST 223, but then trended down ALT 50s, AST 120s by [**5-23**].
Upon presentation, to [**Hospital1 18**] his INR was 2.0. .
RUQ USN, HIDA scan and ERCP were as above.
Hepatitis serologies were hepBsAg, hepBsAb negative, BepBcAb positive.
Given elevated LFTs after ERCP with stent placement, pt underwent liver biopsy on [**2175-5-23**] which revealed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, with cirrhosis.
On [**6-5**], pt's HCT droped from 22-24 ->20 -> 17 requiring transferred to the ICU.
The patient presented without a history of renal disease, however creatinine 1.2 upon presentation to OSH up to 3.3 upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
His temporary dialysis catheter was discontinued on [**5-24**], the tip was sent for culture which was unremarkable.
Abd CT at OSH [**2175-5-7**] showed no hydronephrosis.
UA and UCx were unremarkable, and CT ABD/PELVIS this admission was negative for calculi, or hydronephrosis.
Biopsy was deferred as he was relatively high risk for the procedure and the relevance to management options in this patient (as he was already known to not be a candidate for interferon therapy) were limited.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed which revealed hypercellular marrow with mild erythroid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia and left-shifted myelopoiesis.
