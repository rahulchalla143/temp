Given the absence of this finding on the chest CT from [**Month (only) **] [**2189**], this might represent infectious process or non-infection lung inflammation.
Precise characterization with chest CT will be recommended.

[**Name (NI) **] was found to have an O2 sat of 87%RA.
Initial ABG obtained after intubation showed appropriate oxygenation (7.23/40/242 on 60% AC 600x14, PEEP 5).
Sputum cultures eventually grew step pneumo.
# Ischemia: In the ED, there was some initial concern for ACS given an elevated troponin to 0.07, but serial enzymes were negative.
He was originally started on a heparin drip, but this was discontinued when the enzymes were negative.
During his course in the ICU, the patient continued to complain of left sided chest pain and multiple sets of enzymes were negative and EKG's remained unchanged.
#DM: The patient presented to ED because of FSBS 500s, +ketone in urine, +AG, c/w DKA.
In the ICU, FSBS improved dramatically with 10U regular insulin, to 100s, but started on insulin gtt, and FSBS up to 300s.
# ARF - baseline creatinine 1.2-1.3, up to 2.0 on admission, felt [**2-12**] dehydration from DKA, and rapidly improved with aggressive IVF hydration (total 11L given over initial 24 hrs).
The patient continud to make urine throughout MICU stay, and creatinine was at baseline by HD#2.
# Hyperthyroid - given h/o neck radiation and bradycardia, TSH was obtained (0.087), which was felt suggestive of hyperthyroidism, though difficult to assess in the setting of acute illness.
T4, T3 uptake, and TBG were obtained, and breif curbside with endocrine suggestive that T3 uptake (more appropriate indicator in acute illness) and TSH both being low suggested TSH was likely abnormal because of acute illness.
Without prior colonoscopy on record will likely need age-appropriate screening in future.
Hematocrit remained stable during hospitalization.
