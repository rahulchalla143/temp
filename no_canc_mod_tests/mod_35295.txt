All cx neg at that point.
Repeat Chest CT stable.
Altered MS - Per notes, pt improved significantly from admission when she was essentially unresponsive.
Head CT, MRI, LP, EEG all unrevealing.
She underwent some cognitive testing by OT that revealed some deficits.
Pt will need outpt Neuropscyh eval to further evaluate.
Hx of ARF - resolved and likely [**12-23**] rhabdo as CPK 11K on admission.
Etiology of this attack remains unclear, pt has had [**Name (NI) 5283**] US at OSH per records which was neg and CT A/P here which also did not show any abn.
MRCP does not show any mass, which is re-assuring but if repeat CT shows persistent LAD (see below), concern will be higher.
Pt had TTE and CTA of chest which were neg for structural hrt dz and neg for PE respectively.
Diffuse lymphadenopathy - pt's recent cT C/A/P on [**7-24**] and [**8-7**] have shown diffuse LaD.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] will determine whether he wants to perform repeat CT scan in f/u appointment.
