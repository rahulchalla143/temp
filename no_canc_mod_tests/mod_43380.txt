Given an elevated WBC count, cough, CXR appearance and infected appearing U/A, the patient was started on Vanc/Zosyn and admitted to the ICU.

Imaging: CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW: The heart is mildly enlarged.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2109-10-15**] atrial fibrillation is new.
[**1-4**] abdominal x-ray: IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel obstruction or perforation.

Her INR was elevating to [**2-19**], likely due to a Ciprofloxacin interaction without a concomittant dosage change.
Based on risk/benefit ratio (CHADS = 1), are holding plavix and coumadin, but continuing aspirin on discharge.
Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate: The patient was admitted with a sustained rate of 120s-130s in atrial fibrillation and a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Given persistence of WBC prior to leaving the ICU, repeat cultures were sent, and CXR showed worsening infiltrates.
EKG was not revealing of ST changes.
PE: The patient has an uncertain history of PE based on elevated PA pressure from [**Hospital3 5097**], no confirmatory test performed per HebReb records and daughter.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): Hold for HR<60 or SBP <110.
If HR is elevated and blood pressure can tolerate, consider uptitration of this medication.
You had an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) that became rapid (rapid ventricular response) on 2 occasions, and responded to fluid resuscitation as well as diuresis.
