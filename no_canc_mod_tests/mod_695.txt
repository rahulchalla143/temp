CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -76 BY SAME PHYSICIAN [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of right-sided parenchymal opacity is minimally resolving.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2121-5-18**] 5:51 PM CHEST AP: Moderate cardiomegaly is present.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-18**]  4:29:28 PM Sinus rhythm.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-18**]  4:46:36 PM Probable sinus rhythm with a sinusoidal pattern consistent with severe hyperkalemia or agonal rhythm.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-18**]  5:08:10 PM Probable sinus rhythm with a sinusoidal [**Doctor Last Name 5926**] consistent with severe hyperkalemia or agonal rhythm.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-18**]  5:14:06 PM Probable ectopic atrial rhythm.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-18**]  5:17:34 PM Probable sinus rhythm.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-18**]  6:42:16 PM Sinus rhythm.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2121-5-19**] 8:10 AM As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
ECHO [**2121-5-19**]: Conclusions The left and right atria are moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-5-1**], the magnitude of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure have decreased.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-19**]  8:57:12 AM Sinus rhythm.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-20**]  11:22:44 AM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-5-19**] right bundle-branch block has appeared.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2121-5-21**] 11:19 AM PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart remains enlarged, and there are new, ill-defined airspace opacities at both bases, most likely due to edema given the rapid time appearance.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-22**]  4:45:32 AM Coarse atrial fibrillation.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-5-20**] atrial fibrillation has replaced normal sinus rhythm.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-23**]  3:17:28 AM Coarse atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-5-22**] no significant change.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-23**]  8:21:56 AM Coarse atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular respo nse.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-25**]  8:15:26 AM Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
The lines were removed after two days, once her INR was reversed with IV vitamin K. She did not develop any ekg findings suggestive of hyperkalemia throughout her hospitalization.
# Fluid Status: Patient was total body fluid overloaded throughout her hospitalization, requiring IV lasix to improve urine output.
An ablation was considered to be unnecessary at this time given her history of complications with procedures.
Her coumadin was restarted, and eventually increased to 4mg PO daily, which is double her home dose, to be titrated according to INR goal [**3-16**].
She should have her INR drawn according to discharge orders, on [**2121-5-29**].
# Respiratory status: She was extubated on [**5-20**], and was weaned to 96% O2 saturation on 4L.
CXR showing possible RLL opacity vs. fluid overload.
Her montelukast and atrovent was continued.
She was pan cultured and cultures have been negative.
