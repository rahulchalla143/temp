Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-6-21**], the heart rate is now higher so there is less time for LV relaxation.
Note: PAS-D and Gram stains are negative for fungal and bacterial organisms respectively.
History, exam, and imaging were suggestive of infectious etiology.
Multiple blood and sputum cultures were obtained without definitive results.
Cultures again were negative and patient was started on another 7 day course of HCAP treatment (cefepime, cipro, vancomycin with last dose on [**2147-9-2**]).
After initial treatment of infection subsequent hypotension was thought to be multifactorial including medication induced vasodilation (versed, propofol), overdiuresis, relative adrenal insufficiency and diastolic heart failure.
On day of discharge patient maintained systolic blood pressures 90-100s and MAPs of 60-75.
Of note, noninvasive blood pressure readings were found to be consistently 10 points below arterial line blood pressure readings.
With resolution of infection and management of oral secretions his rate fell to 90-110s.
He was ultimately started on metoprolol to improve cardiac output given his diastolic heart failure.
Recommend continuing to titrate up metoprolol as blood pressure will tolerate.
At time of discharge patient is maintaining HRs of 90s with noninvasive systolic blood pressure readings of 90s-100s with Metoprolol 37.5 mg po TID.

Neutra-Phos 2 PKT PO/NG [**Hospital1 **] 25.
Noninvasive blood pressure [**Location (un) 1131**] consistently 10 points below arterial blood pressure tracing.
Baseline systolic blood pressure 85-100.
