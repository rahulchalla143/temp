His head CT/CTA does not show any early signs of infarction.
CT of head was repeated the next morning showing L temporal lobe infarct but no hemorrhagic transformation.
On HD #2, he was re-evaluated for swallow including video swallow test which he failed hence Dobhoff was placed.
Carotid US was also performed given poor CTA which showed < 40% stenosis bilaterally.
His TEE did not reveal any evidence of cardiac thrombus.
Video oropharyngeal swallowing study showed deep laryngeal penetration with liquids and intermittent aspiration of nectar-thick liquids secondary to swallow delay.
On neurological exam his speech improved slowly (now being able to speak a few words); no motor deficit.
