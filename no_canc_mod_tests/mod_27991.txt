MRI HEAD W/ AND W/O CONTRAST: FINDINGS: There is a single focus of increased signal intensity on FLAIR images near the cranial vertex in the right cerebral hemisphere.
There is mucosal thickening with the fluid levels seen in the left maxillary sinus and some apparent thickening of the maxillary sinus walls consistent with chronic sinusitis.
CT ABD/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST: FINDINGS: Note is made of diffusely increased attenuation of the intraperitoneal fat; however, there is no discrete abscess.
Spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and the visualized portion of large and small intestines are within normal limits.
In the visualized portion of the lung bases, note is made of consolidation in the right lower lobe and a cavitary lesion in the right middle lobe as well as effusion, as demonstrated on the CTA study performed on the same day.
Right lower lobe consolidation and a cavitary lesion in the right middle lobe with effusion, as noted on the prior CT study.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are multiple non-pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the mediastinum.
Chest CT remarkable for multifocal infiltrate.
Induced sputum negative for AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other fungus x 3.
Sputum culture also negative for legionella.
Sputum culture did grow a moderate amount of MRSA.
Four out of 4 blood cultures grew out strep pneumonia sensitive to levofloxacin.
TTE was negative for endocarditis.
Given cultures cleared quickly and no peripheral stigmata, ID agreed with deferring TEE.
PPD was negative.
Patient will be followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from ID, who is aware of follow-up chest CT in 1 month to monitor.
Induced sputum AFB and PCP negative [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 3. .
# Bacillus: Patient grew bacillus (not anthracis) out of 1 blood culture.
Ophthomalogy evaluation showed no evidence of ophthmalmitis.
History of toxoplasmosis but head MRI shows no evidence of past or present toxo.
Lower extremity dopplers showed no evidence of DVT.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound shows portal vein patent.
CT abd and RUQ u/s unremarkable for an alternative source of his pain.
# Anemia: Hematocrit stable at 32.
Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease but need to be repeated when patient is not actively infected.
