RESPIRATORY:  The patient continued on high frequency    oscillatory ventilation with mean airway pressure of 16    and amplitude of 26, with FIO2 requirement of 25 to 36    percent.
The patient's respiratory status worsened with    mild increase in his settings to mean airway pressure of    17 and amplitude to 28.
Since the patient showed better    response with bagging the patient was tried on    conventional mechanical ventilator with peak respiratory    pressure of 23 and PEEP of 6 and a rate of 22 which he    tolerated for a period of 24 hours on day 39 of life.
He    had to be switched back to his high frequency oscillatory    ventilation on day 40 and he was started on the settings    of mean airway pressure of 19 and amplitude of 33.
The    patient remained on high frequency oscillatory ventilation    with settings ranging from mean airway pressure of 19 to    20 and an amplitude ranging from 31 to 35 and a FIO2    requirement from 35 to 60 percent.
Follow up chest x-ray    showed intermittent collapse of the right upper lobe which    would improve with bagging as before.
The patient had worsening of his tracheal    secretions which were sent for culture on [**2117-3-2**]    which showed greater than 25 polymorphs and sparse growth    of oropharyngeal flora, staph aureus coag positive    moderate growth and moderate growth of Klebsiella.
The patient    currently at the time of this dictation is on conventional    mechanical ventilator at settings of 26/6 and a rate of 28    and a FIO2 requirement of 30 to 35 percent.
His blood pressure remained stable    and we have been following this murmur clinically.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient continued    on total fluid of 140 cc per kg per day, breast milk 30,    ProMod p.g.
The patient was advanced    to breast milk 32, Special Care 32 with ProMod on day 38    of life and his total fluid was reduced to 130 cc per kg    per day due to the concerns of his worsening lung disease.
His electrolytes remained    stable.
His last electrolytes on [**2117-3-4**] showed    sodium of 139, potassium of 5.5, chloride of 99 and bicarb    of 32.
His calcium at this time was 11.4, phosphorus 4.8    and alkaline phosphatase of 478.
His length falls below    the 10th percentile, his head circumference is at the 25th    percentile and his weight is at the 10th percentile.
The patient needs a surgical    evaluation for this left inguinal hernia and it is pending    at the time of this dictation.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had his last hematocrit checked    on [**2117-3-4**], day of life 58 which showed the level    of 31.6 and a reticulocyte count of 4.1.
A sputum culture from    [**2117-3-2**] showed staph aureus, coag positive and    Klebsiella and sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora.
NEUROLOGY:  His last head ultrasound was on [**2117-2-3**] which was repeated as within normal limits.
The    patient on examination appears to be appropriate for his    gestational age with no focal deficits.
OPHTHALMOLOGY: The patient had an eye examination on [**2-17**], [**2116**] which showed immature zone 2 that was followed up    in two weeks.
His follow up eye examination on [**2117-3-8**] showed immature zone 2 bilaterally and he needs a    follow up eye examination in two weeks as per the    ophthalmology.
Telephone number if [**Telephone/Fax (1) 33330**].
Patient received his set of immunization priorities on [**2117-3-6**] which included hepatitis vaccine, DTaP and IPV.
The patient needs an evaluation with surgery for a left inguinal surgery.
The patient needs a follow up eye examination as recommended.
Prematurity at 27 week gestational age.
