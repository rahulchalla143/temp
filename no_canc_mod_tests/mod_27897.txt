Her HR was found to be in the 40s and SBP 60's.
EKG sent from [**Hospital1 1474**] reveals junctional escape rhythm in the 40s.A temporary pacer wire was placed in the R IJ at the OSH ED.
Troponins were initially 4.1/8.5/3.9.
On [**2191-9-21**] her pacer rate was decreased from 70 to 60 and her BP improved while in NSR 60's so pressors were weaned off quickly.
Cardiac ROS: Positive for CP, syncope, presyncope, and DOE Negative for PND, orthopnea, edema, or palpitations  Past Medical History: 1)HTN 2)Diabetes mellitus type 2 3) s/p PTCA approx 10yrs ago.
JVP 7 cm.
CV: S1, S2 with Grade II/VI SEM best heard RUSB radiating to carotids Pulm: CTAB, no wheezes or crackles Abd: Soft, NT/ND with normoactive BS.

Echo ([**2191-9-23**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
CT head ([**2191-9-23**]) PRELIM: Atrophy, old lacunar infarcts.
Now in NSR 80-100s and SBP 140-150s without temporary pacer activity.
EKG indicated patient to be in junctional escape rhythm Temporary pacing device was inserted through R IJ.
Due to suspected BB toxicity, patient put on hydralazine for blood pressure control.
An echocardiogram was performed to assess cardiac function which showed EF >55%, aortic sclerosis, mild MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] remained hemodynamically stable without any change in medical management.
Initial elevation of cardiac enzymes likely due to severe hypotension.
Dementia workup was initiated including TSH (normal), RPR (pending), B12 (pending), and head CT (no acute change, old infarcts).
