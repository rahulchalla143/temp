Patient however began experiencing breakthrough episodes of PAF (documented on holter monitor) lasting approximately 3-4 days and which severely limited his abilty to perform actitivies of daily life.
He was maintained intubated and transferred to the PACU off neo, but SBP trended down to the 70-80's and 1mcg/mg/kg in the PACU with SBP 90-100.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: (-)Diabetes, (+)Dyslipidemia, (-)Hypertension 2.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: EP STUDY ([**4-/2158**]) Total of 59 ablation lesions performed (for a total of 5516 seconds) using the 3.5 mm Therma-Cool ablation catheter.
Conclusions 1.
CARDIAC MRI ([**4-/2158**]) Impression: 1.
Renal ultrasound is recommended.
ECHO ([**4-/2158**]) Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The right ventricular cavity is dilated There is no pericardial effusion.
ECHO [**2160-1-3**] The left atrium is normal in size.
ECG: ([**2160-1-1**]) Sinus bradycardia at 43 with PR prolongation and QTc 500.
Monitored on telemetry throughout hospital course with repeat EKG to ensure no QTc prolongation with ibutilide use.
Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive post-procedure with SBP 90-100 on neo.
Saturating 97-100% on RA prior to discharge.
CORONARIES: s/p RCA stent in [**2151**] and repeat cath in [**2157**] showed Patent stent, 70% OM3 non obstructive occlusion, no intervention.
Elevated creatinine: creatinine ranged from 1.0 - 1.3.
Patient did not meet criteria for acute kidney injury and urine output remained adequate.
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime: Please check INR early next Monday for dose adjustment.
He is in normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate is 60 and BP 130/68.
Please have your INR checked on Tuesday [**2160-1-8**] at your primary care doctor's office.
