The patient had seen his PCP 2 weeks ago as part of a routine physical exam at which time his nifedipine was stopped secondary to noted hypotension.
His wife reports that his physician called him [**Name Initial (PRE) **] few days later to have his BP rechecked in his office but the patient did not make it to his appointment.
In the ED, the patient was found to have pancytopenia with a Hct of 14.5, he was guaiac negative with a SBP initially 86 that then dropped to 60 with a HR in the 60s.
His BP rose to 110 with 3 liters IVF, 3 units PRBC in the ED.
His labs were significant for a Hct of 14.5 as mentioned above, plt 89, WBC 2.9, Cr 1.7, AST 50, LDH 2374, INR 1.4, D-dimer 2608, troponin of 0.02. .
His EKG was as follows: .
Initial: NSR 79, Nl axis, RBBB with [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions and TWI V1-v6, <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression II ( no prior EKG for comparison) .
With BP normalization: NSR at 73 bpm, RBBB, NL axis.
A CT of the head was also performed which showed: .
Somewhat limited study due to motion artifact.
MRI will be helpful for further evaluation.
He was evaluated by neurology in the ED who felt his neurologic exam was stable and not indicative for acute stroke.
Based on the CT findings above which showed subacute/chronic stroke, it was recommended that prior head imaging be obtained from [**Hospital1 756**] to document his prior CVA.
He is a former smoker 3 ppd x 12 years - quit 35 years ago.

Brief Hospital Course: # Pancytopenia: On admission the patient was found to be pancytopenic - Hct 14.5, WBC 2.9, ptl 89.
There was evidence of hemolysis with LDH in [**2099**] range and hapto <20, D-dimer 2600.
His Hct rose appropriately to PRBC, being 30.3 after a total of 5 Units given.
The peripheral smear was most notable for polychromatophilia and anisocytosis.
The obtained additional labs revealed a Vit B12 deficiency (75), Folate normal (6.2), elevated Iron (233) and Ferritin (624) and low TiBC (186).
Parameters indicating Hemolysis were low: Hapto(<20), elevated tBili (2.6) and dBili 0.7.
The Retic Count of 0.9 showed impaired production in the BM.
The LDH increase persisted initially, and then started to steadily go down, same with tBili.
Since his Retic Count did not respond as expected to Vit B12 supplementation (being 0.4 on [**5-20**]) a bone marrow biopsy was obtained (on [**5-20**]) to r/o an additional hemolytic disorder, such as AML, aplastic anemia.
The BM biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Vit B12 deficiency as the underlying disorder and showed no signs of leukemia.
# Hypotension On admission the pt presented with BP of 86/48.
His physical exam did not reveal signs of HF, such as increased JVD, hepatojugular reflux, ascites or peripheral edema.
His hypotension was [**Month/Year (2) 2771**] to dehydration and his BP was successfully elevated by volume resuscitation (3l of IVF and 5 Units of PRBC) and d/c of home BP-meds.
Before discharge patient's blood pressure improved and he was restarted on atenolol 25 with SBP 100-110 range.
In the ED a CT of the head was obtained to r/o possible stroke as cause for MS changes.
Since the CT had been negative for acute bleeding, the changes in his MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2771**] to his hypotension on presentation as well as to the Vit B12 deficiency.
A EEG was performed, following neuro recs, which showed widespread encephalopathy.
Since the pt MS improved over the course of his hospital stay, and considering the facts presented above, Neuro did not think that a MRI of his head was indicated for further work-up.
# EKG changes The EKG drawn in the ED showed the following abnormalities: RBBB, ST-depressions and TWI in V1-V6, which were thought to be a result of demand ischemia.
His CK was 43 and his Troponin 0.02.
EKG and Troponin were monitored closely over the following days and resolved after the pt was normotensive and had received PRBC.
A repeat EKG on [**5-19**] showed RBBB, no remaining ST-depressions or TWI.
His Troponin on [**5-20**] was 0.04.
# Chronic renal insufficiency Creatinine presented with Creatinine of 1.7 on admission, which was his baseline Crea according to old recs.
