Pt was given Tylenol 650mg po, aspirin 325mg po, vancomycin 1g IV, Zosyn 4.5g IV, ticlid 250mg, carbidopa 25/Levodopa 100, Comtan 200mg.
He was then given boluses of 1L NS x 3 and BP improved to 120's and he was transferred to the MICU.
CAD s/p CABG and NSTEMIs ([**2-/2117**]: LIMA-LAD, SVG->Diag, OM1, OM2, SVG->PDA); s/p PCI of proximal SVG-D1-OM 1-OM2 with DES in [**6-29**] and PCI of SVG-OM/D with DES in [**8-29**].
CHF: EF 30% 3.
DPs 1+.
Skin: +rash on knees   Pertinent Results: CXR [**2118-4-17**]: Two views of the chest demonstrate stable [**Month/Day/Year 1192**] cardiomegaly, mediastinal contours, and sternal sutures.
cxr [**4-21**]: IMPRESSION: Improved pulmonary edema.

The cause was likely multifactorial including poor intake likely due to parkinsons's disease, increased diarrhea and finally possibly some sepsis as with white count and pneumonia.
His blood pressure was normal on the floor and his blood pressure medications were reintroduced as tolerated.
His cxr showed worsening and he was presumed to have worsened aspiration pneumonia, especially given his ongoing risk of aspiration.
The patient was found to have elevated INR, and the GI team felt his risk of bleeding was very high and despite reversal of his INR GI decided he was a poor candidate for a Gtube given his worsening clinical status.
He had a hepatitis panel sent and RUQ us sent, but the work-up was not completed as the patient was made CMO, and the patient's LFT's were improving.
HIT antibodies were sent and all heparin products were held.
His HIT antibody was positive and with the holding of heparin products the patient's thrombocytopenia improved.
# CHF: On admission the patient had an elevated BNP and a recent EF of 30%.
His cdifficile was negative and he was supported with IV fluids.
He was continued on ASA, statin, beta-blocker, and his ACE was added in once his pressure was stable.
