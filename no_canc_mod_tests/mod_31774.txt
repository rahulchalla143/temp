Admission Date:  [**2127-4-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-4-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Doxycycline Hyclate  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**] Chief Complaint: chest/lower abdominal quaking  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: peripheral dopamine infusion drip IV   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 88 y/o CF with a PMH of CHF with last EF >60%, AS with valve area 0.7 cm2 (peak 84, mean 45), Hypercholesterolemia, h/o Atrial fibrillation off coumadin since admission [**2127-2-21**] for lower GI bleed, stated that last night she developed the acute onset of a "quaking" pressure across her lower chest/upper abdominal area.
12 lead EKG demonstrated Afib with rate 80s, new ST segment depression V4-V6, although V4 more pronounced however ~0.5mm.
Biphasic T waves in precordial leads, present on prior EKG [**2127-2-21**] admission.
Valvular ds: AS (peak 84 mean 49), with valve area 0.7cm2.
2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
NON CONTRAST HEAD CT [**2127-4-22**] FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
No acute cortical territorial infarction is evident, but MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 99040**]I is a more sensitive study to evaluate for acute infarction.
MRI unable to be perfomed, pt's blood pressure too unstable.
Compared with prior EKG dated [**2127-2-21**], ST dep in V4 more prominent.
CXR: [**2127-4-19**] SINGLE PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Again seen is an enlarged heart, stable as well as calcifications of the aortic knob.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2124-2-28**], the severity of aortic stenosis has increased (calculated valve area now severe) and the severity of aortic and mitral regurgitation are slightly reduced (may be related to lower blood pressure).
[**2127-2-17**] - Bleeding Scan - No evidence of bleeding during the time  of the study.
EGD [**9-14**] - Gastric Ulcer.

Brief Hospital Course: Impression:  88 y/o woman with PMH significant for Atrial fibrillation (was not on BB at [**Hospital1 **]) off coumadin since [**2-21**] for LGIB, CHF with preserved EF, likely diastolic component, Severe Aortic stenosis, 2+ MR, who presents hypertensive urgency, volume overload, in congestive heart failure, Atrial fibrillation with Rate ~115, and with lateral ST depressions on EKG.
It was decided among all team members that if the TEE demonstrated clot, no DC cardioversion would be performed.
Pt underwent TEE [**2127-4-22**] showing no clot, and subsequently underwent DC cardioversion.
Consulted Neurology and ordered MRI, which was unable to be performed secondary to the pt's blood pressure being unstable.
Her systolic blood pressure drifted down to 30s systolic.
In the CCU, the pt's vitals were monitored, with her blood pressure continuing to be low.
Also with BNP 6000.
ARF, oliguric- With Cr to 2.9 today, up from  Cr 1.5 post 40mg IV lasix on admission.
# Shock liver: Pt's bp on admission was 220s/100, lowered over 48 hours to 100-120 systolic.
In the first 36 hours post admission, the pt's blood pressure dropped 100 systolic points through IV and po medications.
It was thought that she may require higher pressures as she presented with bp 220/100, and within 48 hours, is 120s systolic.
Her CVA was thought possibly [**1-16**] hypoperfusion/low bp vs. embolic.
