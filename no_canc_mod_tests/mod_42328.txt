In the Emergency Room he was found to have a blood sugar of 990 as well as a metabolic acidosis (7.1-15-150).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature 95.8.
Heart rate 107.
Blood pressure 108/47.
Mean arterial pressure 67.
Oxygen saturation 94% on range of motion air.
Chest slow breathing, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular tachycardia, S1 and S2.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 21, hematocrit 44.8, platelets 268.
Sodium 120, K 4.3, chloride 73, HCO 38, BUN 64, creatinine 2.2, glucose 990, anion gap 36, ALT 17, AST 26, alkaline phosphatase 118, bili 0.4, amylase 230, lipase 139, calcium 7, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 1.9.
CK 224, CKMB 15, troponin (large), lactate 2.6, acetone large, ETOH negative.
Urinalysis greater then 1000 glucose, greater then 80 ketones and no protein, otherwise clear.
Chest x-ray no acute pulmonary process.
Electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per minute, normal axis, wavy baseline, J point elevation in V2 through V6.
[**Last Name (un) **] diabetes consulted and throughout the rest of his stay and NPH and regular insulin were titrated to control his blood sugar.
Cardiac:  In the MICU the patient ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a CK of 224, CKMB 15 and troponin 0.4.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled.
CK and CKMB trended downward, however, the troponin continued to rise.
An echocardiogram was done on [**8-10**], which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 to 30% with global hypokinesis and akinesis in the inferior wall.
His blood pressures varied from 80s to 100s systolic and he was started on Captopril and Lopressor, which were held for blood pressure under 100.
A follow up stress test was done, which again revealed hypokinetic motion in the inferior wall, however, the patient was not found to have any perfusion defects and was able to achieve 84% of his heart rate with exercise.
He did have an abdominal ultrasound done on [**8-11**], which did not show any evidence of cholecystitis, stones, pancreatitis or obstruction.
NPH 24 units q.a.m., 15 units q.p.m., regular insulin 12 units q.a.m.
