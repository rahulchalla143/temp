Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization [**2188-3-4**] Percutaneous coronary angioplasty  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 37217**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with CV risk factor of age and hypertension, with a past medical history also significant for lung cancer status post resection, remote colon cancer status post resection, and hypothyroidism, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2188-3-4**] with acute left-sided chest pain.
At the OSH, initial vitals were T 95, BP 124/75, HR 78, RR 18, Sat 98% on room air.
EKG revealed ST elevations in V1-4.
She was never chest pain free at the OSH and was emergently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
Lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, stage 1) diagnosed in [**2182**], status post resection.
Physical Exam: Physical examination on admission to CCU: VITALS: T 97.0, HR 93, regular, BP 130/77, RR 25, Sat 99% on 100% NRB Hemodynamics: PA 48/25 (34) GEN: Tachypneic, but still able to speak with full sentences.
Pertinent Results: Laboratory data from OSH [**2188-3-4**]: CBC: WBC 9.3, Hb 10.1, Hct 30.6, Plt 197.
Chemistry: Na 140, K 5.1, Cl 104, HCO3 23, BUN 24, Creat 1.0, Glucose 275, Ca 10.0, Mg 2.0.
ALP 57, AST 31, ALT 23, T bili 0.4  Cardiac enzymes: Trop I 0.27  EKG at OSH on arrival: NSR, rate 77, normal intervals, LAD.
EKG at OSH: NSR, rate 71 bpm.

Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
Right sided pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 9 mm Hg and RVEDP was 12 mm Hg).
Pulmonary artery pressures were moderately elevated (PA pressure was 44/24 mm Hg).
Left sided pressures were severely elevated (mean PCWP was 27 mm Hg).
Cardiac index was low (at 2 L/min/m2).
************** [**2188-3-4**] CXR: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with the patient in supine position.
There exists no prior chest examination or records available for comparison.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (20%).
[**2188-3-13**] ECHO (preliminary report): No pericardial effusion.
Coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the LAD, and stenting of the LAD into OM1 was performed, with rescue PTCA to the LAD.
Hemodynamics in the cath lab were remarkable for elevated left-sided pressures with PCWP 27, low CO/CI 2.6/2.0 and elevated SVR 2492, consistent with cardiogenic shock.
Of note, peak cardiac enzymes were CK 5905, ad CK-MB/TropT greater than assay.
An echo was performed on [**2188-3-5**], which revealed EF of 20% with mid to distal anteroseptal and apical akinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere, 2+ AR, 1+ MR, 3+ TR.
On [**2188-3-12**], she was noted to have a pericardial rub, and a repeat echo was performed on [**2188-3-13**], which revealed no pericardial effusion.
2) CHF: As mentioned above, an echo on [**2188-3-5**] revealed an EF of 20%.
Weight at discharge is 36.3 kg.
She will need close weight monitoring.
Urine lytes were suggestive of prerenal physiology with FeNA 0.2%, and her renal failure was ultimately felt likely secondary to poor forward flow and contrast nephropathy.
Further work-up was not pursued.
Weight at discharge is 36.3 kg.
