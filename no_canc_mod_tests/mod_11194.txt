MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Assess cord compression, disc disease  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man s/p fall, ?
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, and STIR images of the cervical spine were obtained with axial, gradient echo and T2-weighted images of the C2-3 through C7-T1 interspaces.
The CT scan shows with much greater clarity the moderate left and milder right-sided neural foraminal stenosis likely due to uncovertebral spurring and facet joint degeneration.
Also, the CT scan shows the prominent disc space narrowing far more dramatically than the MR study.
There is type 2 degenerative endplate change on either side of the C3-4 disc, although the CT scan again shows that this area also has sclerotic reaction, representing type 3 degenerative endplate change.
CONCLUSION: Suboptimal examination due to patient motion.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: widened mediastinum?
