An electrocardiogram revealed ST elevation and peaked T waves.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization.
Catheterization revealed that right dominant system normal, normal LMCA, LCX with mild disease, right coronary artery with 40% mid and 50% posterior descending coronary artery stenosis, left anterior descending coronary artery with 70% stenosis at the origin and 99% stenosis due to thrombotic occlusion distally with slow TIMI two flow.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT PRESENTATION:  Pulse 65.
Blood pressure 120/58.
Respirations 18.
Oxygen saturation 100%.
Lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally.
LABORATORIES AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White blood cell 6.2, hematocrit 46.4, platelets 141, sodium 143, potassium 3.9, chloride 106, bicarb 21, BUN 16, creatinine .7, glucose 81, CK 130, and troponin less then 0.01.
Electrocardiogram at outside hospital showed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 70, normal intervals, right axis, ST elevation in V1 through V4, peaked T waves in V1 through V4 and flat Ts.
After stent placement at [**Hospital1 69**] electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of78, normal intervals, normal axis, ST elevation in V2 through V4 is still present, but decreased and there is a Q wave in V3 of questionable significance and normal T waves.
Peak CPKs was 2600 and peak troponin was more then 50.
Total cholesterol was 206, HDL 46, LDL 142, triglycerides 89.
Echocardiogram showed an EF of 30%, apical akinesis, anteroseptal and free anterior wall hypokinesis.
An echocardiogram showed an EF of 30% with akinesis at the inferior wall and hypokinesis V3 and septal inferior wall.
