Her sats came up with 2 L of oxygen.
Chest X-ray was clear.
CT chest showed no evidence of thymoma.
Her blood type was A+ and her CBC was followed daily.
Her HCT dropped from 42 on admission to a nadir of 24.0.
While this was thought to be partially dilutional, there was concern for hemolysis as her LDH was elevated (291) and haptoglobin had decreased to 68 from 125 and her direct Coombs test was positive.
She received one unit of PRBCs and her hematocrit remained stable between 27-30 for the three days prior to discharge.
She was guaiac negative and iron studies were unremarkable.
Continue your medications as prescribed and please continue frequent blood draws to monitor your hematocrit as this had been low at the time of discharge.
