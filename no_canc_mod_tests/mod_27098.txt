Admission Date:  [**2147-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-2-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-6-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization s/p stenting to LAD and biliateral iliac arteries   History of Present Illness: 46 y/o F w/ obesity, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco abuse, who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] after having episode of CP at 11:30pm after taking friend's SL NTG.
Pt presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] for evaluation of CP and had ST elevations 2mm or greater in V1-V3.
Initial vitals at [**Hospital1 3325**] were T 98.3, BP 200/114, HR 96, sats 98% on RA.
Cath revealed LAD 80% lesion that was stented x2 (Cypher).
Past Medical History: HTN tobacco use obesity hypercholesterolemia  Pertinent Results: CHEST - PORTABLE AP ([**2147-2-10**]): The heart size is within normal limits for technique.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**2147-2-10**]): Right dominant circulation LMCA: without angiographically apparent flow limiting disease LAD: proximal 50% and then a hazy 80% stenosis with TIMI 2 fast flow.
The R-PDA and R-PL were without any flow limiting disease.
The calculated cardiac output by the Fick method was 4.8 L/min with a cardiac index of 2.4. .
Transthoracic echocardiography ([**2147-2-10**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).

Final angiography showed no residual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow.
Initial angiography of the left coronary artery showed an interval occlusion of OM1 with fresh thrombus.
The lesion was crossed with a PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] wire and dilated with a 2.0x20 mm Voyager balloon at 8 atm, restoring flow to the vessel.
Final angiography showed no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI 3 flow.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented to OSH with anterior STEMI with peak CK 815, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization, which was significant for the findings detailed above.
Lopressor and captopril were added, with good control of her blood pressure.
Transthoracic echocardiography during hospitalization was significant for an ejection fraction of 50%, with anteroseptal and apical akinesis / hypokinesis (results detailed above).
The patient was continued on integrillin for 18 hours post-procedure with a peak CK of 1137 which resolved to 287 at time of discharge.
She remained chest pain free following cath and was discharged in good condition.
Please make sure you have your kidney function and potassium checked at that visit.
In addition, as above, someone from the cardiology offices will be calling you to schedule you for an additional heart catheterization in the next 2 weeks.
