The LMCA, LAD, and LCx were free of angiographically significant disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal resting systemic  arterial pressure.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is a focal defect in the basal inferior septum on 2D and color Doppler with continuous left-to-right flow c/w a post infarction ventricular septal defect (VSD).
Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the interventricular flow).
CXR ([**2139-8-30**]): Current study demonstrates top normal heart as well as bilateral hilar enlargement and pulmonary edema.
MRI ([**2139-9-7**])  1.
Transmural of late gadolinium enhancement in the inferoseptal wall, and 45% non-transmural late gadolinium enhancement in the inferior wall extending into the inferolateral wall, consistent with myocardial infarction and low (inferoseptal wall) to intermediate (inferior wall) likelihood of functional recovery after revascularization.
Recommend follow-up chest radiograph after acute illness to document resolution.
# VSD: Physical exam on admission to the CCU revealed a new III/VI systolic murmur heard thoughout the precordium concerning for new VSD/MR.
[**Name14 (STitle) **] showed VSD, cardiac MRI later showed 3:1 shunt fraction, normal RV size with free wall hypokinesis and elevated PA pressures.
Her O2 sat remained >93% on RA throughout her course and she was given diuresis for reducing pulmonary edema and shunt, and minimizing pulmonary hypertension.
Blood pressure was also optimized to decrease afterload and maximize forward flow.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - F/U WITH CT SURGERY/INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY - Adjust lasix 80 mg po qd - Should have RHC to assess shunt function which could help decide whether patient needs to have her shunt fixed  # A-fib: Pt was found to have a period of unsustained symptomatic A-fib, lasting ~30 mins.
# HTN - Her home Verapamil was held and she was started on Metoprolol and Lisinopril with SBP goal in the 90s given the lack of mortality benefit of CCB (especially verapamil)  # GERD - Patient has a documented history of GERD, and takes omeprazole at home.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Pt maintained a full code during this admission - Pt has follow up with Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] in one week and CT surgery in 2 weeks  Medications on Admission: - Vit D 50,000U every other sunday - Verapamil 240mg qday - Omeprazole 20mg qday - Clonazepam 0.5mg po qhs - Pioglitizone 30mg qday - Pregalbin 25mg qday - Ultram 50mg prn back pain  Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

In terms of new medications, we have started you on the following medications:  -Aspirin, 325mg daily to prevent another heart attack -Plavix, 75mg daily to keep the stent open.
Do not stop taking your aspirin and plavix together unless Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] tells you it is OK. -Lisinopril, 5mg daily to lower your blood pressure -Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily to lower your cholesterol -Amiodarone, 200mg once daily to keep your heart in a regular rhythm.
-Furosemide (Lasix), 80mg daily to prevent fluid overload -Metoprolol 25mg twice daily to lower your heart rate and help your heart recover from the heart attack.
