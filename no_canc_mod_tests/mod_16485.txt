Pericardium data -- reference number [**Serial Number 52717**], lot     number [**Telephone/Fax (5) 52718**]).
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath and further evaluation of her severe AF.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation of operative candidacy for aortic valve replacement.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 7cm CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.

The LAD had a 50% mid-to-distal stenosis; there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the diagonal branch.
2) Supravalvular aortography demonstrated 1+ aortic regurgitation.
3) Distal abdominal aortography demonstrated patency of the left iliac artery (diameter >7mm) and an accordion effect of the right iliac artery, due to vessel tortuosity.
4) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated left-sided filling pressures, with a mean wedge pressure of 35 mmHg, and marked pulmonary arterial hypertension, with a PA systolic pressure of 75 mmHg and a mean PA pressure of 49 mmHg.
CT chest w/o contrast [**2159-11-23**]: 1.
Neoplasm is substantially less likely, but follow-up in 8 weeks or comparison with prior studies is recommended.
Carotid Doppler [**2159-11-23**]: Right ICA <40% stenosis.
[**2159-11-28**] Intra-op TEE Conclusions There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
ABG on room air showed metabolic alkalosis (likely contraction alkalosis from diuresis).
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== - Patient will need 8 week chest xray to evaluate left lower lobe consolidation seen on CT chest [**2159-11-23**] - Patient should follow-up with endodontist after discharge from rehab to evaluate 4th tooth.
PCP should consider further workup including possibly repeat PFTs if patient with persistent cough after improvement in cardiac function.
She underwent bronchoscopy for Right Upper Lobe collapse, mucous plug was removed and lobe re-expanded.
She was transfused two units of blood for a hematocrit of 28%.
