Pt found by EMS with BP 90/60.
Upon arrival to [**Name (NI) **], pt afebrile, HR 143 (sinus), BP initially 126/52 with O2 sats 94% on 2L NC.
CXR unremarkable.
ECG with ?S1, Q3, T3.
CTA revealed large bilateral PE in main pulmonary artery.
Her SBP subsequently decreased to the 70's, and she was therefore intubated.
She was re-started on IV heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-100.
Her oxygen saturations have been stable at 96-99%.
HIT antibody was sent as the pt had a plt drop from 275 to 147, which has returned negative.
The pt underwent bilateral LENIs, which revealed a non-occlusive right popliteal vein thrombus.
Per pt report, total cholesterol 160, TG wnl.
I/O 1007/2210 -1.2L General: Pt is an pleasant, obese, Caucasian female in NAD.
CXR [**2-25**]: No consolidation.
CTA [**2-25**]: There are large proximal filling defects present within both the right and left main pulmonary arteries extending into segmental branches of the right lower lobe, right middle lobe, left lower lobe, and left upper lobe consistent with massive bilateral pulmonary embolism.
LENI's [**2-26**]: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] demonstrate normal compressibility, augmentation, flow, and waveforms within the common femoral, superficial femoral veins bilaterally.
Her goal INR is 2.0-3.0.
Her O2 sat was int he upper 90's on dicharge and she did not require oxygen.
Will need out patient evaluation for underlying hypercoagulable states (in addition to those above), as this would potentially affect long term management.
her platelet count returned to [**Location 213**] before discharge.
[**Location 2320**]: She was monitored with FS QID and treated with Insulin drip in the ICU, which was switched to SC insulin.
