STUDIES: CT head [**2129-5-21**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage  CT abd / pelvis w/ contrast, CTA chest [**2129-5-21**]: Striated appearance of both kidneys with stranding, concerning for renal infarcts given provided history.
CXR [**2129-5-21**]: Extensive chronic appearing interstitial disease.
CXR [**2129-5-21**] post line plcmt: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right internal jugular catheter that extends to the upper portion of the SVC.
Hct was stable.
CTA was negative for PE.
During this episode, and EKG was obtained that revealed new T-wave inversions in his lateral leads.
Cardiac enzymes revealed an elevated troponin I to 0.46.
The following day, he was transferred to the MICU in the setting of new onset hypotension to SBP 80s.
An Echo was obtained [**5-26**] that revealed decreased EF = 10% and biventricular dysfunction consistent with cardiogenic shock.
CT head was obtained and did not reveal an acute intracranial process.
EEG was obtained [**5-26**] showing global encephalopathy without evidence of epileptiform complexes, Neurology felt neurologic dysfunction could be from recrudecenc of old infarct deficits.
Cr at baseline was intially at baseline.
Intial Echo [**5-23**] did not show vegetations that could account for renal infarcts.
Creatinine was trended with renal function as described below.
