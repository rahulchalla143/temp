Patient had CXR done at OSH which showed diffuse reticular nodular opacities involving bilateral lungs.
CT chest at OSH was reported to show diffuse ground glass opacification and diffuse adenopathy.
There was also adenopathy that was compressing the trachea, given this concern for airway obstruction patient was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
He was ruled out for MI with negative CEx3 and negative EKG  Past Medical History: Type 1 diabetes Asthma Diabetic nephropathy fractures fibula [**3-/2181**] H/O MRSA PNA   Social History: Smokes 1ppd for many years, no drug or etoh history, history of jail time  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: PE: T 97.8 BP 110/48 HR 102 RR 16 O2SAt 97% AC 450x14 PEEP 5 FiO2 60 7.21/70/80 Gen: Patient intubated, sitting up in bed, gagging on tube Heent: PERRL, EOMI, ETT tube in place Neck: no LAD appreciated Lungs: diffuse ronchi throughout Cardiac: tachy, RR S1/S3 Abdomen: soft NT +BS Ext: no edema Neuro: awake   Pertinent Results: [**2182-6-5**] 03:55PM   NEUTS-55 BANDS-14* LYMPHS-19 MONOS-8 EOS-4 BASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0 [**2182-6-5**] 04:15PM   TYPE-ART RATES-14/ TIDAL VOL-450 PEEP-5 O2-60 PO2-80* PCO2-70* PH-7.21* TOTAL CO2-30 BASE XS--1 INTUBATED-INTUBATED VENT-CONTROLLED .
CT chest [**6-6**]: FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube is in place, with tip terminating just above the level of the aortic arch.
The remaining imaged portion of the upper abdomen is unremarkable on this unenhanced CT which was not specifically tailored to evaluate the abdominal organs.
echo [**6-6**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal; there are echolucent areas in the basal and midventricular segments of the right ventricular free wall; the apical segment of the right ventricular free wall appears thin.
Impression: status post cardiac arrest; dilated hypocontractile right ventricle; consider arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy .
CTA [**6-15**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE [**6-18**]:  No evidence for intracardiac (right-to-left) shunt identified.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2182-7-2**] 12:45 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-26**] through 9.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-7-6**] 2:35 PM There is dense collapse and consolidation of the dependent aspects of both lung bases, right greater than left.
[**2182-7-10**] 9:47 AM CHEST, UPRIGHT AP PORTABLE: Comparison is made to five days earlier and to a more recent CT from [**2182-7-6**].
Brief Hospital Course: 38 y/o M with DM type 1, history of jail time who presented to OSH with what was thought to be CAP, found to have ground glass opacification and diffuse adenopathy on chest CT s/p intubation for airway obstruction, development of ARDS.
He underwent BAL which grew MRSA.
Thus, he underwent CTA which was negative for PE but showed some progression of prior opacities (along w/ stable b/l effusions).
(Of note, on admission and on CT scan there was question of possible tracheomalacia/obstruction.
They felt that pt did not have typical MRSA PNA picture as cx had low MRSA colony count and imaging showed lymphadenopathy and ARDS/multifocal pneumonia.
Pt received 16 days of ceftazidime and 14 days of linezolid and doxycycline, the latter of which was added for empiric tularemia tx.
Pt defervesced and white count decreased with above treatment.
With slight worsening appearance of opacities on chest x-ray, still concern for tularemia or other pathology not covered/ -Follow up on Tularemia abx, blood cx -Follow up appointment with ID .
CXR shows resolving effusions/edema.
Lasix was given PRN, and as [**7-10**] CXR demonstrated possible fluid overload 40 IV lasix given.
Lasix to be given as needed if signs of overload, clinical and imaging studies demonstrate need.
The cause was likely respiratory as prior to the event the patient had oxygen sats in the 70's.
Once of sedatives, and ventilator, BP increased and pt was hypertensive during weaning off narcotics and sedation.
PPD placed at OSH which was negative.
[**Month (only) 116**] still require LN biopsy if this does not resolve w/ tx of PNA.
## DM type 1 - The patient's sugars were closely followed and was treated intermittently with insulin drip and when off the drip glargine and SSI according to his finger sticks.
