LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
POST BYPASS There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of about 35-40%.
The maximum gradient across the mitral valve was 8 mm Hg with a mean of 4 mmHg at a cardiac output of about 7 liters/minute.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
