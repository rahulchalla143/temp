Of note, pt was seen in [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2193-2-22**] w/ HTN urgency, which was noted incidentally as he was being prepped for an outpatient lung biopsy scheduled for same day, though the procedure was cancelled due to pt's HTN.
He initially presented to [**Hospital 26580**] hospital, where his EKG was reportedly unchanged from priors--though I do not have these to confirm this finding.
His TropI was 1.97.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 97.8, 64, 143/98, 18, 97% on RA.
EKG showed LAD, LAFB, IVCD, new Q waves lateral precordial leads (V4 &5), TWI in III, flattened TW in avF and V1, V3, V4, and ?V5, also ~1mm STE in lead II.
His EKG showed no change from than in the ED.
Past Medical History: - Sarcoidosis--affecting abd & lungs (dx'd at [**Hospital1 112**] years ago) - HTN - CVA 2yr ago --> residual r sided weakness/ pfo v. asd/ stress in [**2189**] (may have been done at [**Hospital1 112**]) - H/o DVT - Chronic pain - l adrenal adenoma - s/p splenectomy, cholecystectomy, ?
Family History: N/C  Physical Exam: VS - 97.6, 52, 133/94, 16, 96% Gen: WDWN middle aged male in NAD.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated EKG showed LAD, LAFB, IVCD, new Q waves lateral precordial leads (V4 &5), TWI in III, flattened TW in avF and V1, V3, V4, and ?V5, also ~1mm STE in lead II.
OTHER TESTING: AP UPRIGHT CHEST: The study is compared to a chest radiograph from [**2-22**], [**2193**].
The previously noted vague opacity in the left  mid lung is not as well seen on the current study; however, please note that  the previous study was a dedicated PA and lateral chest.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

CP was reduced with morphine but was in some pain after catheterization with EKG rvealing some resolution of ST elevations in V3-V4.
His cardiac enzymes were followed and continued to trend down.
An echo was obtained showing a normal EF and no wall motion abnormalities.
A lipid panel was obtained with an elevated LDL 152.
