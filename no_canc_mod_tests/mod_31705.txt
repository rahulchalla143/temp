TTE [**10-4**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-9-28**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now slightly lower.
Brief Hospital Course: 88 year old female with a past medical history of addison's, PE [**2127**], HTN, mild AS s/p recent femur fx and ORIF p/w fevers, hypotension, PE and elevated troponin concerning for PE vs sepsis.
# Hypotension / Sepsis / Pulmonary Embolism: The pt arrived with SBP 60-70's.
A CXR showed ?
Blood cultures show no growth to date and urine was negative for a UTI.
CVP 6, MAP's 55. lactate 1.4.
Echo showed mild RV dilation, but only mild systolic dysfunction, and improved pulmonary htn compared to last echo.
EKG did not show ischemic changes, but trop of 0.2 and BNP of [**Numeric Identifier **] suggest strain.
Blood pressures have been stable and O2 saturations have improved, now satting in mid 90s on room air.
She was given Coumadin 5mg on [**10-5**] and [**10-6**] with INR 2.4 ON [**10-7**] from 1.4 [**10-6**].
Since this was a rapid rise, her INR as well as any signs of bleeding should be monitored closely at rehab since INR will likely be supratherapeutic.
She should be given 2mg Coumadin on [**10-7**] with dose adjusted according to INR levels with goal [**1-10**].
Particle/Crystal PO once a day: Hve your potassium levels checked every 1-2 weeks .
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Check INR daily until stable and adjust coumadin dose prn for goal INR [**1-10**], coumadin should be held on [**10-8**] for INR of 3.5.
Osteoporosis 5. s/p R hip fracture and ORIF [**2140-9-26**] 6. s/p bilateral total knee replacements 7. h/o PE post-operatively in [**2127**]   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, shortness of breath improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure and found to have low oxygen levels and blood clots in your lungs.
We started you on  blood thinning medication for the blood clots.
We were initially concerned you had pneumonia because you had a fever so started you on antibiotics but there was no evidence of pneumonia on your CAT scan so we stopped your antibiotics on [**10-7**].
Your lovenox has been stopped at time of discharge as your coumadin levels were adequate.
You were started on potassium supplement, you should have your potassium levels checked regularly.
Your nifedipine from home has been held since your last admission, you and your doctor may consider restarting this should your blood pressure remain consistently elevated above 140.
