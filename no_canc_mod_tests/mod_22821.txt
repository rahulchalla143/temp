[**2167-4-5**] CXR: Frontal view of the chest compared to prior study from [**2167-4-3**], demonstrates patchy airspace consolidation of both lower lobes, increased from prior study, consistent with pneumonia.
[**2167-4-6**] EKG - Atrial fibrillation.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2167-4-2**] the T wave changes in leads III, aVF and V4-V6 are much more prominent.
If clinical concern remains high, consider CT study for further evaluation.
[**2167-4-13**] LUE ultrasound Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of the left IJ, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins.
Lung volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size.
IMPRESSION: Right subtrochanteric femoral fracture fixated by IM rod and gamma nail with unchanged 13 mm lateral step off.
DISCHARGE LABS: - Na 125 - Cl 93 - HCO3 25 - K 4.0 - BUN 8 - Cr 0.5 - Glu 93 - Ca 7.7 - Mg 1.7 - Phos 3.5 - WBC 3.9 - Hct 30.9 - Plt 199  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 79974**] was hospitalized with a right hip fracture following a fall and underwent an uncomplicated right open reduction of his internal fracture with a cephalomedullary nail.
His hypoxia and airway issues improved during a short stay in the ICU.
Please continue to monitor ecchymosis, INR, and incision drainage (staples removed [**2167-4-15**]).
Pt is without clinical signs of obstruction or perforation or infection, but would have low threshold to evaluate with CT scan if he complains of any abdominal or hernia/scrotum pain, if hernia appears tense, or if with any fever/white count, nausea/vomiting, or other signs of obstruction/perforation/incarceration.
Normal bowel movement was guaiac negative on [**4-9**].
Anemia: Received a total of 3 units PRBC transfusion in the first few days postoperatively, and hematocrit remained stable thereafter.
Blood loss was into subcutaneous space as evidenced byt RLE ecchymoses.
Hematocrit has been stable at ~30.
Hyponatremia: to low 120s postop, labs indicated hypovolemic hyponatremia, which improved with normal saline hydration.
His sodium has improved with fluid restriction of 1500mL daily and sodium supplementations.
Please continue to monitor electrolytes as above.
His blood pressure and heart rate remained well-controlled without additional medications.
On arrival his sugars were in the 190s, but a hemoglobin A1c was 5.6%, and his sugars remained below 150.
A test dose of Lasix was given and his serum sodium remained stable.
Incidental finding of carotid calcification on chest x-ray: Will require outpatient follow-up with primary care provider.
Tablet(s) 12. sodium chloride 1 gram Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): Discontinue when serum sodium >130.
Please have your primary physician evaluate your [**Name9 (PRE) 19390**] atrial fibrillation and work up potential osteoporosis leading to your hip fracture.
You will need labs drawn three times a week and can stop the salt replacement pills when your sodium reaches 130.
An ultrasound demonstrated bowel in your inguinal hernia that has extended into your scrotum.
- ADDED Sodium Chloride 1g tablets three times a day, to be discontinued when your serum sodium is >130 - ADDED Furosemide 20mg daily - ADDED Multivitamin and Colace.
