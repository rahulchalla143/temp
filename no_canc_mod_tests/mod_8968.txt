Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 5.8.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vitals showed a temperature of 95.1, pulse of 86, blood pressure of 102/49, respiratory rate of 26, oxygen saturation of 98%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat showed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The heart had a tachycardic rate and regular rhythm.
Neurologic examination showed the patient to be alert and oriented times two.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission revealed a white blood cell count of 13.1, hematocrit of 30, platelets of 345.
Differential showed 96% neutrophils, 2% lymphocytes.
PT of 15.2, PTT of 29.6, INR of 1.5.
Urinalysis was significant for a moderate amount of blood, greater than 1000 glucose, 300 protein, and 15 ketones.
Sodium was 114, potassium of 8.6, chloride of 76, bicarbonate of less than 5, blood urea nitrogen of 140, creatinine of 6.9, glucose of 1271.
The anion gap was 33.
Calcium of 9.1, magnesium of 2.9, phosphorous of 14.2.
Urine sodium was less than 10, urine creatinine was 41, urine osmolalities were 382.
Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7, PCO2 of 19, and a PO2 of 121.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed a question of a retrocardiac opacity.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 75 with normal axis.
Her enzymes were cycled to rule out possible myocardial infarction.
Liver function tests showed the patient to have elevated amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatitis which was thought to be a possible cause of her diabetic ketoacidosis.
She had a CT scan on the second hospital day to look for possible retroperitoneal bleed given a 10-point hematocrit drop overnight, as well as to image the pancreas given her elevated amylase and lipase.
She received 2 units of packed red blood cells on the second hospital day for her 10-point hematocrit drop, and her hematocrit stabilized.
The drainage was sent for Gram stain and culture.
On the fourth hospital day, the patient was improving with regard to her blood sugars, but she was still on an insulin drip as she was not taking p.o.
The Gram stain from her abscess showed only gram-positive cocci.
