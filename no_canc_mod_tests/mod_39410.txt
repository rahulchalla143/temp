Pt was taken to OSH where CT head demonstrated a moderate sized (~3 cubic cm) IPH into the R posterior parietal lobe w/ SAH extension.
Pt was largely unable to give clear HPI and much of the above was obtained from OSH records and from fragments of conversation.
Sensation: Intact to light touch in R-side but absent from lower 2/3rds of RUE and in RLE (no response to noxious stimuli).

No evidence of underlying vascular anomaly, no evidence of active contrast extravasation.
MRI Head [**1-2**]: IMPRESSION: Limited exam demonstrating right parietal parenchymal hemorrhage as seen on CT, not further characterized.
If desired, the exam can be repeated when the patient's condition stabilizes.
CT Head [**1-2**]: IMPRESSION: Right parietal parenchymal hematoma with adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhage, similar to the recent CT.
MRI [**1-4**]: Redemonstration of right parietal lobe hemorrhage, with subarachnoid extension, without clear identification of a source for the hemorrhage.
A CTA was performed which did not reveal AVM or aneurysm.
He was loaded with dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and his SBP was kept below 140.
On [**1-2**] the patient was found to have a focal left arm seizure - a stat Head CT was performed which showed no change in the size of the hemorrhage.
An MRI with and without contrast was obtained on [**1-4**], which did not reveal a mass.
The decision was made to transfer care to the neurology service for further evaluation and management of this hemorrhagic stroke.
However, on Monday [**2201-1-19**] he developed respiratory distress with tachypnea to 40s, desaturation, SBP to 215.
He also spiked a temp to 102 and  had a rising WBC.
ABG was 7.5/35/81.
CXR showed midline trach and no white out.
Blood cultures quickly grew out GNRs.
Aggresive fluid resuscitation and blood pressure support were continued with multiple pressors.
RUQ US obtained due to apparent abdominal tenderness; US showed free air.
Surgery consulted, however pt too unstable to go for CT scan.
