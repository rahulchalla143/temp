She described her pain as diffuse over her upper back, non-radiating, not related to position change, [**4-26**] in intensity.
Work up included chest CT that was negative for aortic dissection.
EKG showed ST elevations in anterior precordial leads.
CK 194, CKMB 24, index 12, TropT 0.131.

Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system  revealed two-vessel disease.
Post-angiographic hemodynamic evaluation revealed moderately  elevated right-sided pressures (mean RA was 11 and RVEDP was 14 mmHg), severely elevated left-sided pressures (mean PCW was 26 mmHg), and moderately elevated pulmonary pressures (PA was 48/24 mmHg).
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 2+ flow (See PTCA  Comments).
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2173-8-2**]: 1.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (EF 35-40%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Brief Hospital Course: Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed 2 vessel disease (LAD totally occluded proximally and mid RCA 70% stenosis).
LAD was stented with 3.0 x 23 mm Cypher stent, and a jailed diagonal branch was rescued with a 1.5 mm ACE balloon.
She remained on integrilin drip for 18 hours following catheterization and then was continued on heparin drip.
Beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor doses were gradually maximized based on blood pressure and heart rate.
The patient's blood pressures were checked prior to her discharge and were in 120/80 range.
LDL and total CHOL came back high, 157 and 281, respectively.
LFTs were WNL except AST elevation that was thought to be related to release of enzymes from the myocardium.
Her right groin site checks revealed no complications.
CHF - Echocardiogram revealed EF 35-40% with septal, distal anterior and apikal akinesis.
Based on the echo results, it was felt that 8 weeks of oral anticoagulation are indicated for this patient.
On the day of discharge her INR was still subtherapeutic 1.1.
She was discharged home with Coumadin and was instructed to have her INR checked in 2 days and Coumadin dose adjusted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6359**].
The patient was given a prescription slip to have her INR and K level checked prior to her appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6359**].
She will need a repeat echocardiogram in one month after discharge.
Please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 23281**] or fax ([**0-0-**]) results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6359**] for adjustment of Coumadin dose.
