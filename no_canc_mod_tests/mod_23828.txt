Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 916**] [**Known lastname 88468**] was evaluated by the Trauma team in the Emergency Room and admitted to the Trauma ICU for further management of her injuries as well as evaluation by the neurosurgery service.
She underwent serial hematocrits and neurologic exams.
As her hematocrit remained stable since her transfusions in the Emergency Room, her sedatives were discontinued for a good neurologic assessment and she was eventually weaned and extubated from the respirator on [**2152-12-18**].
While in the ICU a small amount of drainage was noted from her ear and confirmed to be CSF.
She had no neurologic deficits from her small SAH with IVH and a repeat Head CT done 24 hours after admission showed no increase in the size of the bleed.
Her mini mental status exam showed some deficits with memory, attention span and delayed recall.
She will need continued OT as well as a referral to the Cognitive [**Hospital 878**] Clinic.
She developed fevers during her hospitalization and was pan cultures on 2 occasions.
The most revealing change was a chest Xray on [**2152-12-20**] which showed bilateral lower lobe opacities, possibly consistent with pneumonia.
A PICC line was placed for IV antibiotic therapy but she physically improved as did her chest xray and she will complete her course on oral antibiotics.
