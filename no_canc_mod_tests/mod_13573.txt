Patient developed sore throat and fever with chills and cough, and has a temperature max of 102 with rigors.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Pneumonia three months ago, which was treated with an overnight admission in [**Hospital3 **].
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vitals:  Temperature  99.0, heart rate 120, blood pressure 143/68, respirations 23, sating at 91% on room air and then 100% on a nonrebreather.
DATA:  Laboratories:  White count 3.1, hematocrit 42.6, platelet count 181.
Neutrophils 67, bands 12, lymphocytes 14, monocytes 2, eosinophils 0, basophils 0, 2 atypicals, 3 metamyelocytes.
His PT was 13.4, PTT 27.8, INR 1.2.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.2, bicarb 31, chloride 100, BUN 8, creatinine 0.8, glucose 120, calcium 8.6, magnesium 1.8, phosphorus of 2.1.
AST of 17, ALT 17, LDH 210, alkaline phosphatase 37, amylase 18.3, T bilirubin 0.5, albumin is 3.0.
ABG:  7.43, 43, 61 on 100% nonrebreather.
Pneumonia:  When patient initially presented to the hospital, patient had studies sent off for varicella zoster, herpes simplex types I and II, [**Month/Day (1) 50508**] and Gram stain for fungi as well as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 50508**] of the nasal swab for viruses, testing for Mycoplasma pneumonia by antibodies as well as by PCR, and antibody testing for [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus.
Blood culture and urine culture as well as sputum [**Doctor Last Name 50508**] were also sent off.
Additionally, skin biopsies of the patient's vesicular rash was done x2 to test for varicella.
Patient had a deep skin biopsy, which was then taken which was positive for erythema multiforme.
Patient's chest x-ray by time of completion of antibiotic regimen revealed that he had small bilateral pleural effusions and a left middle lobe infiltrate with resolution of the left lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient also had a CT of his chest performed on [**2111-10-6**] which was consistent with a new right middle lobe infiltrate which was felt to be secondary to BAL of the right middle lobe.
Throughout his hospitalization, patient had very thick blood-tinged expectorant from his lungs, which was felt to initially be consistent with desquamation caused by [**Known lastname **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome, and later given that his course was complicated by a left lower lobe pulmonary embolus which arose from a right upper extremity DVT, his blood-tinged sputum was thought to be caused by supratherapeutic PTT and airway changes from [**Initials (NamePattern4) 22721**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
As his pulmonary examination improved, he was maintained on pressure support ventilation and tolerated pressure support and PEEP of 5 without any complications.
In an effort to search for sources of infection, ultrasound and CT of the abdomen were performed which were entirely normal with the exception acalculous cholecystitis.
Otherwise, a CT of the head and sinuses was performed and revealed that the patient did have sinusitis.
Wound [**Month/Year (2) 50508**] of these lines were negative to date.
Otherwise, all of patient's blood [**Month/Year (2) 50508**] remained no growth to date.
By the time of discharge, the patient's platelet count was normalizing to the 500.
Renal function:  When patient initially presented to the hospital, he was given aggressive fluid resuscitation, and then later was diuresed with Lasix with a bump in his creatinine from baseline of 0.8 to 1.3.
He tolerated this well, and by time of discharge, his creatinine was at baseline.
Heme:  Patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout his hospitalization, but he did have one episode of hematocrit decreased to 22 felt secondary to his significant amounts of blood tinged sputum as well as phlebotomy.
His hematocrit remained stable during his hospitalization.
