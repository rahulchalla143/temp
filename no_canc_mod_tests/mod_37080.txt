She reported considerable problems with lower extremity edema over the weeks preceding admission with an approximately 12-lb weight gain and [**2-23**] pillow orthopnea.
The morning after her fall (the morning of admission), her family decided to bring her in for further evaluation given her persistent cough and leg swelling.

Right Shoulder XRay ([**2119-6-26**]): No acute fracture or dislocation.
The pulmonary vasculature is congested with perivascular haze and hazy peripheral densities in the mid lung field which have now increased in comparison with the last study and suggest development of pulmonary edema.
Comparison is made with multiple chest examinations obtained during the last week and they disclose findings consistent with CHF, continues progression of pulmonary congestion.
TTE ([**2119-6-28**]): Suboptimal image quality.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-5-9**], the estimated PA systolic pressure is lower.
TTE ([**2119-7-11**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-6-28**], severity of tricuspid regurgitation and degree of pulmonary hypertension have both decreased.
Discharge Labs: Creatinine 1.9 Potassium 4.7 Sodium 140  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with CAD, atrial fibrillation c/b tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM placement, CKD, asthma and heart failure with preserved EF, who presented with cough, lower extremity edema and hypotension.
Chest radiography revealed a possible infiltrate and the patient received 8 days of antibiotics for a health-care associated pneumonia (Vancomycin plus Zosyn, which was switched to Cefepime, and, finally, Levofloxacin to complete the course).
TSH was elevated but did not indicate significant hypothyroidism (see discussion below).
Patient developed a persistent metabolic alkalosis and her serum creatinine remained elevated at approximately 2, up from a baseline of 1.5, which was concerning for overdiuresis.
Urine lytes were not helpful in assessing for intravascular volume depletion (FEUrea ~ 43%, UNa 33).
A TTE did not reveal evidence of worsening cardiac function or valvular disease but did reveal a near-normalization of pulmonary artery pressures as well as loss of a TR gradient, which fit with a clinical picture of overdiuresis.
Her serum creatinine peaked at approximately 2.
Urine lytes did not help in differentiating the etiology (FEUrea ~ 43%, UNa 33) but other data suggested overdiuresis.
Left Lower Extremity Erythema: Patient was treated for cellulitis during a recent admission in [**5-1**].
Leukocytosis: Patient presented with WBC count of 13.4 with neutrophil predominance though no bands or atypicals.
Blood cultures negative on admission.
UA negative on admission (no urine culture performed).
Cough and CXR suggestive of consoliation concerning for HCAP, for which she received 8 days of appropriate antibiotics.
Her serum bicarbonate at discharge was normalized.
TSH on [**2119-7-10**] is 6.9.
Normocytic Anemia: Hematocrit 34 on admission and remained stable in the low 30s.
Shoulder xray revealed no fracture but did indicate chronic rotator cuff disease.
Close monitoring of thyroid function tests as above 2.
Close monitoring of creatinine and BUN as above.
D/C Cr 1.9 3.
Close monitoring of symptoms of diastolic heart failure.
Ppx: The patient was maintained on SQ heparin throughout the hospital course Code status: Full code Contact: [**Name (NI) **] (sister), H:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 106094**], C:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 106095**] Lines: none Access issues: difficult but possible with peripheral sticks Dispo: extended stay rehab facility   Medications on Admission: 1.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1* 8. guaifenesin 100 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: 5-10 MLs PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for cough.
Hypotension (Low Blood Pressure) 3.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with low blood pressure and leg swelling, likely due to heart failure.
Fluid was removed with a diuretic called Lasix but the amount of fluid that could be taken off was limited by your blood pressure.
