ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 44-year-old male, with a question of a diagnosis of bowel ischemia at outside hospital, transferred here with bradycardia, though the patient appeared to be making improvement with systolics of 120, and he was clinically stable.
The patient was taken to the operating room after CT abdomen was reviewed with radiology which revealed dilated small bowel with pneumatosis, and some portal venous air, colon with thickening, some free-fluid in the abdomen, as well.
The patient was then taken to the ICU where he was given many fluid boluses to keep his urine output at goal.
His urine started to pick up.
The patient had a baseline exam of abdominal distention, which though at first was worrisome, but when correlated with the clinical picture of the patient tolerating his diet and not having any recurrence of his nausea or vomiting, it was felt safe to proceed to advance the patient's diet.
Valproate sodium 250 mg/5 ml syrup, 5 ml po tid.
