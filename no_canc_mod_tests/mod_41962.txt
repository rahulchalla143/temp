A limited panel is performed to determine B cell clonality.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral increased T2 signal within the subdural space with pachymeningeal enhancement is new from the prior examination of [**2125-8-10**].
MRV negative  Hip x-ray: There are some mild degenerative changes with medial joint space narrowing seen bilaterally and some osteophytes, but no fractures identified.
Her LP (63 wbc, lymphocyte predominant, high protein, low glucose, GS negative) has shown lymphocytic pleocytosis and is overall suggestive of an aseptic meningitis.
Cytology showed a hypercellular specimen, most likely reactive.
