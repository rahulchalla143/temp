In the ED initial vital signs were T96.9 P116 88%RA with tachypnea.
Her stool was guiac negative, her abdomen exam was benign, and a CXR demonstrated atelectasis.
Her HCT dropped from a baseline of 29 to 21, and her K was elevated at 5.8 in the setting of a elevated Cr of 2.8  Further imaging of the abdomen demonstrated diverticulosis, a non-obstructive stone, a pericardial effusion, and no retroperitoneal bleed.
On transfer, she was ordered two units of blood and her vitals were: T 98.5, BP 120/65, HR 90s, RR25 Sa: 95%3LNC.
Vital signs: T35.9 P86, BP 61/46 (on Lower Leg), RR21 SA 91 3LNC.
Dullness to percussion on the left, with left basilar crackles.

TTE [**2105-7-3**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-6-16**], the pericardial effusion findings are new and c/w impaired filling/early tamponade physiology .
TTE [**7-4**] 11:08am There is a large pericardial effusion.
TTE [**7-4**] 11am Post pericardiocentesis.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compred to the pre-tap study from today, the pericardial effusion is smaller and tamponade has resolved.
Pericardial effusion was incidentally found on a CT abd/pelvis.
Pt was transferred to CCU for findings suggestive of cardiac tamponade physiology on ECHO [**7-3**].
AM of [**7-4**] echo showed increased severity of tamponade and pt appeared cold and nonperfusing.
She was noted to be hypotensive with low urine output which did not resolve after pericardiocentesis.
Bilateral pleural effusions on CT scan and X-ray likely [**12-30**] tamponade physiology and elevated L sided pressures.
ARF: Presented with Cr 3.1 from BL 0.7.
Had a previous CT stone protocol showing a non-obstructive pattern; no recent CT contrast.
Urine lytes, culture, were sent; CK and Vanc levels were drawn.
Urine and blood cultures sent.
