**FINAL REPORT [**2140-6-11**]**     YEAST VAGINITIS CULTURE (Final [**2140-6-11**]):    NEGATIVE FOR YEAST.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2129-8-22**] frequent ventricular ectopic activity is now present.
Compared to the previous tracing ventricular ectopic activity is no longer present.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2140-6-9**] at 3:26:24 PM Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-10-30**], findings are similar.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2140-6-14**] at 3:14:19 PM Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2140-6-9**] MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST: Acute right middle cerebral artery territorial infarct with blood products.
Right iliopsoas bursitis, with 4.5 x 2.3 cm fluid collection.
Age-indet L1 compression fx with 60% loss of height, L1-2 degenerative changes.
CT head did not shows any hemorrhage or signs of infarct, CTA shows cut off in the right M2 segment, CT perfusion showed increased MTT in the right hemisphere with decreased flow in the area, perfusion volume mismatched with MTT.
MRI showed an acute right middle cerebral artery territorial infarct with blood products.
Echo showed EF 70%, focal calcifications in the aortic arch and mild 1+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] had TEE [**2140-6-14**] which showed no cardiac source of embolus identified with no evidence of PFO or ASD with bubble.
Fibrinogen was 633.
Her left sided weakness and neglect improved and her dysarthria improved although fluctuates throughout the day with persistent hemi-sensory loss.
# R MCA infarct: Patient presented with left hemiparesis, right gaze preference and dysarthria and found to have an acute left MCA stroke on CT-perfusion and MRI imaging and as she was within the time window received IV thrombolysis.
Her swallowing was impaired and was upgraded to soft foods and thin liquids by discharge.
Work-up for the etiology of her stroke included echo and TEE which showed no cardiac causes and fibrinogen was mildly elevated at 633.
Risk factors were addressed with HbA1c with negative CEs, HbA1c 5.9%, chol 181 and LDL 100.
BP was allowed to auto-regulate and her anti-hypertensives were slowly re-introduced.
She will need further uptitration of her anti-hypertensives as an out-patient.
You received clot-busting therapy for the blood vessel that was blocked and caused your stroke and you were transferred to the ICU for monitoring.
You were assessed with an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) which was unremarkable and a further echocardiogram with the use of an endoscopy showed no evidence of clot in the heart.
You had an MRI scan which showed similar appearances and CT scans were stable.
You had a CT scan of the body which showed some slight enlargement of the thyroid gland and will have to have an ultrasound as an out-patient to assess this and cysts (which can be normal) within the kidneys which should also be assessed by ultrasound as an out-patient.
You should have an ultrasound of the thyroid and the kidneys as an out-patient organised by your PCP.
