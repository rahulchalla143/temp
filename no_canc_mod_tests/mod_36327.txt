He started these medications yesterday and developed a severe headache on the night of admission with temperature of 100.7.
In the ER there, he continued to be confused and had CT of his head which showed opacificiation of his sphenoid sinus with concern for epidural abscess vs subdural empyema.
No LP was performed given this concern but he was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone and flagyl and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.2 P 86 BP 118/79 R 16 O2 sat 93% RA.
Patient's CT was reviewed by neurosurgery here who felt there was no CNS extension of the sinus opacification.
Neurology reviewed the film with her CT with radiology and agrees there does not appear to be any signs of empyema or abscess.
LP was recommended by deferred given INR of 3.0.
Patient was transferred to the MICU with vitals of 78, 120/84, 19, 99% RA.

Labs at discharge: .
INR 2.1 Na+ 133 K+ 4.1 Bicarb 26  WBC 8.8 HCT 30.5 Plt 293   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69yo M with atrial fibrillation presenting with altered mental status in setting of sinus infection.
Per discussion with neuro, no clear findings on CT head of CNS extension but given severity of sinus disease and proximity to CNS, will aggressively workup.
MRI head demonstrated ventriculitis.
He was continued on Vancomycin, OSH culture data showed strep pneumo.
Serial BCx were sent and were pending on transfer to the medicine floor.
At time of discharge, cultures were either "no growth" or pending.
# Sinusitis: He has had sinus symptoms with CT findings of sphenoid opacification.
He developed atrial flutter/fib with rapid rate in setting of fevers.
He will also be discharged with coumadin 4mg daily for goal inr of [**2-17**].
His INR on discharge was 2.1. .
Pt was fluid restricted, and Na improved to 133 on discharge.
He should also have PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] with possible Neurosurgery referal for intervention on his Meningocele.
He needed extra rate control before we restarted his dronederone.
You will need to have an MRI prior to your appointment with the infectious disease doctors.
