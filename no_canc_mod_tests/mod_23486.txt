He was taken to OSH where BP was 210/110, was given 20 labetalol IV.
stroke scale was done which was 20, CT head showed left BG bleed.
BG was 175, other lab work was grossly unremarkable.
EKG showed occasional PVCs.
CT scan at that time showed intraventricular hemorrhage, without obvious intraparenchymal source.
He did have a head CT at that time, which showed no new insults.
His PCP also notes that he has always been poorly compliant with his medications, so his blood pressure has been poorly controlled.
Medications on admission (verified with his nursing home): -Aspirin 81mg -Flomax 0.4mg -Lisinopril 20mg -Metformin 850mg [**Hospital1 **] -Simvastatin 10mg -B12 injections monthly   Past Medical History: HTN, Diabetes, hyperlipidemia Hx of fall w/traumatic SAH and frontal contusions Hx of prior IPH   Social History: Lives at [**Location 70637**] Place  Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: O: T:98.6 BP:188/99  HR:70 R:16   O2Sats:98% 100% CMV mode  Gen: Intubated, not responding to verbal commands, withdraws to pain and winces to sternal rub.
IMPRESSION:  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage, centered in the left basal ganglia, minimally enlarged compared to a study performed approximately three hours earlier.
NCHCT ([**3-13**]) FINDINGS: Again visualized is a 4.5 x 2.2 cm measuring left basal ganglia hematoma with surrounding edema, unchanged from prior exam.
CXR ([**3-23**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-12**] through 18.
CXR ([**3-25**]):  Micro: [**3-16**]: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2172-3-17**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**3-18**]: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2172-3-19**]):    NO GROWTH.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2172-3-18**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2172-3-22**]):       10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.
He had a non-contrast head CT which showed a 2.2x4.5 cm left basal ganglia hemorrhage.
He had repeat head CTs on [**3-13**] and [**3-16**], which showed stable hemorrhage.
Exam on discharge was notable for flaccid paralysis on the right, but he will localize to painful stimuli on the right with his left hand.
Goal SBP remains less than 160, and he can be treated with additional IV hydralazine as needed, however blood pressures have been well controlled today (104/49-155/67) without need for IV medication.
He had three sets of negative cardiac enzymes on admission.
A lipid panel showed significant elevation in triglycerides, but with normal cholesterol, so his simvastatin was increased and he was also started on fish oil.
He continues to require frequent suctioning for secretions, with signs of right sided aspiration pneumonia, however his most recent chest x-ray is showing signs of improvement.
He had urine, sputum and blood cultures drawn, which were negative.
CXR showed a small degree of atelectasis, but no pneumonia.
Repeat cultures were drawn on [**3-18**] for temperature of 100.7.
On [**3-20**] CXR showed significant aspiration pneumonia for which he was started on vanc/cipro/cefepime to continue through [**3-29**].
Sputum cultures from bronchial aspirates showed primarily normal flora.
On [**3-25**] he had a vancomycin trough of 35, so his vancomycin is currently on hold.
He should have repeat daily troughs drawn, with a goal trough of 15-20, and vancomycin should be restarted once his levels are back in therapeutic range.
His WBC was slightly increased at 16.1 on [**3-25**], however he remains afebrile and cultures have so far been negative.
