The patient is on hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with a history of a myocardial infarction (status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2185**]), congestive heart failure (systolic failure) with last ejection fraction of 40%, history of hypertension, and history of hypercholesterolemia.
His symptoms resolved over the next 40 minutes.
In the Emergency Department, the patient's rectal temperature was 94.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
He reported a good appetite, and his weight has been unchanged.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Vital signs on admission revealed the patient's temperature was 94.2 degrees Fahrenheit rectally, temperature was 92.2 degrees Fahrenheit orally, his blood pressure was 216/60, his heart rate was 84, his respiratory rate was 16, and his oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric with pink conjunctivae.
Cardiovascular examination revealed he had a regular rate and rhythm.
Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation but had some posterior crackles that were fine which migrated half the way up posteriorly.
Extremity examination revealed extremities were warm, dry, and no edema.
Radial and dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally and equal.
Ophthalmologic examination revealed 20/200 in the left eye and 20/40 in the right eye.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems with hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and abdominal pain; thought to be a presyncopal episode.
The patient had a computed tomography of the abdomen which had been in the Emergency Department which eventually ruled out diverticulitis as a source of his abdominal pain.
The patient's white blood cell count on admission was 9.6 (with 80% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes, and no bands).
An electrocardiogram done at that time revealed some peak T waves, poor R wave progression, sinus rhythm at a rate of 72, normal intervals.
A chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no effusions or evidence for congestive heart failure.
The patient's troponins were cycled and were 0.12 and 0.14.
Creatine kinase and MB values, however, were negative times three sets over 24 hours.
Given his history of congestive heart failure and his need for kidney and pancreas transplant, an electrophysiology study was planned to evaluate whether or not he had any foci for ventricular tachycardia and whether or not he would need a defibrillator placed.
The patient's cortisol levels were found to be 32 during this episode of hypoglycemia.
His oxygen saturation was found to be low.
The patient had thyroid studies which were within normal limits.
Throughout the remainder of the patient's admission, the patient's glucose levels were within the normal range and frequently with levels of 200 to 300 given the aggressiveness with which we decreased his insulin doses to prevent hypoglycemia.
On the day of discharge, the patient had glucose levels in the range of 150 to 200.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  Throughout his entire admission, multiple blood cultures were checked.
Chest x-rays and urinalyses revealed no source of infection.
The patient was frequently hypervolemic which complicated his blood pressure regimen.
The patient also had episodes of hyperkalemia for which he received Kayexalate which then caused vomiting and a questionable aspiration which caused his oxygen saturation to drop to 95% on 3 liters nasal cannula and then required a nonrebreather mask temporarily.
After that event, a chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiograms revealed peaked T waves in strained patterns in V1 and aVL.
After dialysis, the patient's oxygen saturations were much improved on 1 liter via nasal cannula.
After this event of a congestive heart failure exacerbation, the patient's troponin levels increased again to 2.24.
Once again, his creatine kinase and MB levels did not increase.
Electrocardiogram revealed minimal changes.
The patient was given heparin for second rule out for myocardial infarction which was then stopped when his creatine kinase levels were negative.
All of this was discussed with the Electrophysiology consultation team, and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**], and the patient's primary cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) who felt that the patient would benefit from having a cardiac catheterization to rule out any coronary artery disease.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed normal coronary anatomy and widely patent vessels.
After that, the patient went for an electrophysiology study which revealed no foci of ventricular tachycardia.
Subsequent chest x-rays revealed a question of a right lower lobe infiltrate thought to be due to aspiration and vomitus.
The patient's oxygen saturations improved, and at the time of discharge the patient was breathing well and had no shortness of breath or wheezing and required no oxygen.
His Lantus and sliding-scale insulin were titrated for optimal control throughout his admission.
The patient's blood pressure became a difficult issue.
His labetalol was increased to 300 mg by mouth twice per day, and he was frequently given hydralazine to keep his blood pressure in the range of 140 systolic.
At the time of discharge, the patient had a blood pressure in the range of 140s to 150s systolic; occasionally dropping as low as 120.
His hemodialysis was to be continued on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as an outpatient.
At the time of discharge, the patient was instructed to follow up with his [**Last Name (un) **] physician and for further evaluation of whether his hypoglycemic episodes were due to low glycogen stores, or dosing his insulin too high, or an inability to read his insulin.
The patient was sent home with [**Hospital6 407**] to dose his glargine themselves as well as with a Humalog pen to dose his sliding-scale more accurately.
The patient was scheduled to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10088**] on Wednesday, [**2189-12-9**].
