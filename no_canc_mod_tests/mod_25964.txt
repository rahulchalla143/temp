CT C SPINE [**6-15**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or malalignment with normal prevertebral soft tissues.
CXR [**2118-6-15**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Cardiology TTE [**2118-6-14**] The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale identified by color Doppler study or agitated saline contrast study (at rest x 2) in suboptimal views (cannot definitively exclude).
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-6-14**] the rate is increased and no longer bradycardic.
Head CT then showed R MCA stroke.
He was out of the window for tPA or intervention based on the time last seen well and the CT findings.
NEURO: # Right MCA stroke: The patient was somnolent on presensation and during examination developed bradycardia to 40s and hypertension over 200s.
Head CT did show increased edema in the R MCA territory with mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle but no significant midline shift or downward herniation.
A repeat head CT the following morning showed no significant worsening, and his clinical exam had begun to improve.
CTA showed normal vessels in the head and neck.
Cardiac telemetry showed intermittent bradycardia but no atrial fibrillation.
TTE was normal.
An abbreviated hypercoagulable panel was sent (anticardiolipin negative, lupus anticoagulant negative) were negative.
Further hypercoagulable work-up will be deferred to the o/p.
Repeat CT scan was without evidence of herniation.
CIWA scale was stopped on the day of discharge.
There episodes were were without changes on ECG and other cardiac workup including echo were unremarkable with no source of cardiac cause of stroke.
His TSH on admission was significantly suppressed (TSH 0.040) however in discussion with Endocrine, this was felt to be of limited significance given his acute illness.
Repeat TSH [**6-20**] was 4.1. .
Transitional issues: Patient awaits further hypercoagulable work-up regarding the etiology of his stroke to include Factor V Leiden, fibrinogen and consideration of CT-chest/abdomen/pelvis.
You presented with left sided weakness and slurred speech and were found to have a stroke on the right side of the brain on CT and MRI scan which was responsible for this.
Your CT scans of the head were stable.
Medication changes: We STARTED heparin to prevent blood clots we STARTED folic acid 1mg daily We STARTED multivitamins We STARTED thiamine 100mg daily We STARTED famotidine 20mg twice daily for increased stomach acid We STARTED aspirin 325mg daily to reduce risk of further stroke We STARTED a nicotine patch We STARTED acetaminophen as required for headache although this should be used sparingly We STARTED simvsatatin 20mg daily to help lower cholesterol and hence risk of stroke We STARTED ibuprofen 400mg as required for pain We STARTED gabapentin 200mg three times daily for arm and leg pain from your stroke We continued your Trileptal (oxcarbazapine), sodium valproate and mirtazapine   Followup Instructions: We made the following neurology appointment for you:  Department: NEUROLOGY When: MONDAY [**2118-8-8**] at 3:30 PM With: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3445**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 858**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage
