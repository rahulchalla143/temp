CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION: 78-year-old woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
COMPARISON: [**2116-1-21**], 22:02.
CT HEAD WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Again seen are small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci near the vertex on the left as well as a small focus in the interhemispheric fissure and parietal lobe.
The appearance of the rest of the study is unchanged.
Neurologically she is at her baseline with mental status, and no focal neuro deficits found on admission.
Repeat head CT showed stable small SAH.
C-spine CT showed no cervical fracture.
YOU WILL NEED A CAT SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST  - Please follow up with Plastic services clinic for your nasal bone fracture within 1 week of discharge with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
