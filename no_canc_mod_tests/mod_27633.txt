EGD showed mild gastritis and no active bleeding.
Capsule endoscopy was also performed on [**2-13**] that showed a few mild erosions in the duodenum and proximal small bowel as well as a few nonbleeding redspots in the mid and distal small bowel.
Labs at his [**Hospital1 1501**] this morning showed Hct 20.1 (down from 27 on [**2-27**]) and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.
In ED VS were T 97 HR 85 BP 96/53 86% TM.

CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2200-3-6**] 2:23 PM  CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: source of GI bleeding.Please administer PO and IV contrast.C Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 56 year old man with congenital heart dz, s/p VSD repair, GI bleeding.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: source of GI bleeding.Please administer PO and IV contrast.Concer for small bowel source, CT enterography please.
TECHNIQUE: Multiple MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of 150 cc of Optiray intravenously.
FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST AND WITH LIMITED ORAL CONTRAST: Again there is evidence of median sternotomy and four-chamber cardiac dilatation consistent with a history of conigential cardiac disease.
Within the limitations of the study there is no evidence of a gross mass within the bowel or for extravasation of intravenous contrast into the bowel lumen.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST AND WITH LIMITED ORAL CONTRAST: No intravenous contrast is seen within the lumen of the pelvic loops of bowel though enteric contrast is seen in the rectosigmoid area.
Technically limited study without sufficient oral contrast; within these limitations no GI bleed is unambiguously defined and no gross mass is identified.
For further clarification consider a tagged red blood cell nuclear medicine study with delayed views if bleed is intermittent.
G/GJ/GI TUBE CHECK PORT  [**2200-3-8**] 1:07 PM  G/GJ/GI TUBE CHECK PORT  Reason: eval for correct placement of J-tube  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 56 year old man with J-tube that fell out today, was replaced at the bedside.
He never had a notable large bleed but hematocrit continuously drifted down slowly.
However, he had some respiratory distress requiring placement on the ventilator and the GI team at [**Hospital1 2177**] recommended deferring the procedure at this time.
Repeat capsule endoscopy was attempted this admission but he could not swallow enough in order to tolerate capsule placement (with or without endoscopy).
After being diuresed for 3 days, he developed oliguria with urine microscopy consistent with ATN.
His creatinine has currently plateaued at 2.1.
Good urine output currently, and as his creatinine remained at approximately 2, his lasix was restarted at 20mg po bid.
His creatinine should be checked one week after discharge and adjusted accordingly.
In light of his chronic lower GI bleed, it was decided by the ICU team that his anticoagulation would be discontinued.
No CAD on cath in [**12-10**].
