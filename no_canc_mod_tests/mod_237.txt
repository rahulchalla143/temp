The patient with known cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology with known coronary artery disease by MIBI echocardiogram, scheduled for an elective catheterization but had increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion, therefore admitted prior to his cardiac catheterization and ruled in for non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
His catheterization at [**Hospital6 2911**] showed 50% left main, left main 80% left anterior descending, 70% right coronary artery with an ejection fraction of 20%.
Catheterization done at that time also showed an aortic valvular area of 0.8 cm squared.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, heartrate 109 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 117/77, PA pressure is 33/26 with a mean of 28.
Respiratory rate is 24 and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air, 96% with 2 liters of oxygen.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, anicteric, not injected, no jugulovenous distension, no bruits, no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs, distant breathsounds, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 8, hematocrit 39, platelets 200,000.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.9, chloride 96, carbon dioxide 25, BUN 21, creatinine 0.8, glucose 286, PT 14.5, PTT 119.2, INR 1.4.
At that time his creatinine was noted to have increased from 0.8 preoperatively to 1.9 on postoperative day #2 to 2.6 on postoperative day #2.
At that time a right upper quadrant ultrasound was done and the General Surgery Service was consulted.
The right upper quadrant ultrasound done at that time showed sludge in the gallbladder.
His acute renal failure was stabilized with a creatinine maintaining a steady 2.3.
However, it was noted over the several day period, that the patient was persistently hypertensive with a rise in his creatinine related to that hypertension.
The patient was noted to have urinary retention and with the discontinuation of the above-noted cardiac medications, the patient's systolic blood pressure improved from the 80s into the 100 to 110 range.
His discharge physical examination showed vital signs of temperature 97.4, heartrate 94, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 121/63, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
Weight preoperatively was 96 kg and at discharge was 102.9 kg.
Laboratory data on [**2135-1-3**] showed white count 12.3, hematocrit 30.8 and platelets 356, sodium 136, potassium 5.1, chloride 103, carbon dioxide 25, BUN 43, creatinine 1.6, glucose 58.
Respiratory, breathsounds distant, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20%.
