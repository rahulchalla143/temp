In the ED, her initial vitals were notable for temperature of 30.6 degrees celsius.
Hematocrit was 21.7 (from baseline in mid 30s in [**2175**]), with platelets of 34 (from baseline 200-300 in [**2175**]), and white count of 8.0.
Diff on white count showed 81 polys and 3 bands.
INR was 1.8 with lactate of 3.4.
Labs otherwise notable for hypernatremia to 163 with creatinine of 1.4 from baseline 0.7 to 0.8.
She was started on norepinephrine and intubated for airway protection given concern of altered mental status and aspiration on CT scan.
Vitals at time of admission are BP 123/67, HR 62, RR 16, sat 100% on assist control ventilation, FiO2 100%, Vt 450 with PEEP of 5 and RR 20.

Electrocardiogram ([**2178-9-14**]): Atrial fibrillation.
Compared to the previous tracing T wave changes in the precordial leads are similar.
Imaging Data:  CT head ([**2178-9-14**]): IMPRESSION: No change from 12 hours prior.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2178-9-14**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure(PCWP>18mmHg).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-10-1**], biventricular hypokinesis is now present and the severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation have increased.
CTAP ([**2178-9-13**]): 1.
Follow-up CT to demonstrate resolution is suggested.
The celiac axis, SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] appear patent, however, stenosis at the proximal portion of these vessels may be severe (please note that this study is not dedicated for evaluation of intra-abdominal arteries).
Followup MRI can be obtained for further evaluation if clinically warranted.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary this is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman presenting with abdominal pain, worsening mental status, found to be hypothermic and hypotensive in ED, initially intubated on pressors and treated empirically for urosepsis/aspiration pneumonia.
Vanco was initially given as stopped on day 4 since sputum cx was negative.
TSH was wnl.
Her hypothermia improved with treatment of the urinary tract infection.
Of note, lipase and transaminases were normal.
However, given the above CT findings, they felt that surgical intervention was not indicated.
# EKG changes, positive tropinin: likely demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis and profound anemia.
Pt was seen by neurosurgery and her head CT was repeated while in ER without sig change in bleed.
In addition to the blood products given in the ER (RBC x 4, plts x 7), she was given 1 more unit of plts.
Her anemia appeared to be a combination of likely GI losses since stool was guaiac positive and hemolysis.
