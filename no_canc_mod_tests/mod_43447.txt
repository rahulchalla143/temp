The patient became less responsive and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
His CBC demonstrated a left shift and his CXR was concerning for a LUL PNA.
OSH PICC line (placed [**2185-3-23**]) was removed due to MSSA bacteremia, new PICC placed [**2185-5-4**].

ABDOMEN X-RAY [**2185-5-2**] FINDINGS: Two portable abdominal radiographs were obtained.
Repeat radiographic examination is suggested.
CXR [**2185-5-2**] IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**2185-5-3**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%).
ULTRASOUND RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY [**2185-5-5**] IMPRESSION: Limited exam but no evidence for DVT.
Once his treatment is completed, he should have surveillance cultures to verify resolution of bacteremia.
The pt was also empirically treated with oral Flagyl for the C.diff colitis, however 3 sets of stool were negative for C. difficile toxin.
Two sets of pt's blood cultures showed MRSA and the rest of the cultures were pending at the time of discharge and will need to be followed by the pt's primary care physician.
The pt was treated with Vancomycin (to complete a total 14 day course on [**2185-5-16**]) for the MRSA bacteremia (trough goal 15-20, current adjusted dose is 1 gram q48h).
Once treatment with Vancomycin is completed, the pt will need to have surveillance cultures to ensure clearance of bacteremia.
The pt had 3 stool samples sent that were negative for C. difficile toxin.
The pt remained afebrile on the floor and his white count was not elevated.
His electrolytes were repleted.
Renal: Patient has chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.3-1.5) and he was noted to have a creatinine of 1.8 on admission.
It is likely that the pt will need uptitration of his insulin if the blood glucose levels continue to remain elevated.
