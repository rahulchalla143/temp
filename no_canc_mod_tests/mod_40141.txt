OSH CTs have subsequently noted interval enlargment of a lesion.
A bronchoscopy on this admission revealed a ball-valve type lesion, mobile with positive pressure and is thought to be causing obstruction leading to COPD exacerbations and pneumonias.
In addition, one month prior to this admission he was noted to have a PE and subtherapeutic INR which was treated with heparin drip.

The mass was sent for pathologic examination and revealed endobronchial hamartoma.
# Pulmonary Embolus, chronic - diagnosed on OSH CT approximately one month prior to this admission.
His INR was 1.2 at the time of discharge and the patient was advised to start lovenox until INRs could be checked and were ensured to be in the therapeutic range.
Despite explaining to him the need for Lovenox teaching, co-administration of Lovenox and warfarin, and the need for INR checks, he wanted to leave the hospital right away.
He should follow-up with his PCP for INR checks.
An ACEI and statin can be considered in the outpatient setting.
