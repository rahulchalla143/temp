Vitals in the field were: 168/90 58 16 100%.
On Arrival to the ER, vitals were: T 97.4, BP 162/98, HR 58 RR18 and O2Sat 100%.
CT scan showed large left putamenal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.

CT scan showed large hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia with intraventricular extension.
Blood pressure was controlled with labetalol to try and minimize further hemorrhage.
Repeat head CT showed slight interval increase in left midbrain compression and loss of the paramesencephalic space, with extension of blood into the fourth ventricle.
With assistance of [**Last Name (un) **] consult, blood sugars were also controlled to help neurological recovery.
Though bleed was likely due to hypertension, MRI was done to evaluate for any other etiology.
Initial CSF showed elevated RBCs from the intraventricular blood but no evidence of infection.
However, chest x-ray remained clear, without evidence of infiltrates.
He was weaned form labetalol to captopril and metoprolol for blood pressure control.
Sputum, blood and urine cultures remained negative.
LFTs, pancreatic enzymes were also normal, and head CT without evidence of sinusitis.
CSF sampled from the ventricular drain on [**6-17**] still had significant RBCs and a proportional number of WBCs, so still without evidence of infection.
On [**6-23**], patient was less alert than in the several days prior, lungs had increased crackles, and sputum had Gram-positive cocci on Gram stain so he was started empirically on levofloxacin and vancomycin as fevers to 102 persisted, WBC count remained at 14, and it was felt his decreased alertness was likely due to fever and infection.
Fever slightly better on [**6-24**], but then on [**6-25**] spiked again to 102 and WBC count up to 16.
Lumbar puncture was done, and CSF was xanthochromic with 300 WBC (69%N, 4%L, 27%M), 166 RBC, protein 150, glucose 53.
His exam remained unchanged and he was felt to be too sleepy for swallow evaluation.
Speech and swallow evaluation was performed and patient was started on nectar thick liquids and ground solids.
