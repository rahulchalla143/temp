Her initial ECG was concerning for anterior lateral ischemia.
In addition, her creatinine was 2.4 and blood sugar was 700.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
The pt underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed no significant CAD in LAD, LCx but chronically occluded appearing RCA.
LVEDP was 20 at the beginning of cath but during this episode, PCWP was 30 and PaSaO2 was 44%.
An IABP was placed during the cardiac catheterization and PaSaO2 inc. to 64%.
CHF 20% in '[**60**] with global hypokinesis.
Repeat TTE in '[**61**] with EF of 50%.

Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The LMCA showed no angiographically apparent stenoses.
The LAD showed a 40% midsegment stenosis and appeared tortuous.
The RCA showed a proximal 100% stenosis with considerable left to right collaterals to the distal segment and RPDA from the LAD.
Resting hemodynamics after onset of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventriular response demonstrated severely elevated filling pressures including mean right atrial pressure of 27 mmHg and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 32 mmHg.
Cardiac output was moderately depressed with cardiac index of 2.1 L/min/m2.
After restoration of sinus rhythm and balloon pump insertion, hemodynamics markedly improved with mean right atrial pressure of 7 mmHg, PCWP mean of 10 mmHg, and cardiac index of 3.2 L/min/m2.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-6-14**], left ventricular systolic function now appears much improved although prior study was technically suboptimal.
Given the episode of decompensation in the cath lab and the chronic nature of her occlusion, it was decided that no further attempts at catheterization would be attempted, and the patient was medically optimized on ASA, Lisinopril, and Lipitor.
A stat TTE performed in the cath lab during her episode of decompensation revealed a severely depressed LV function with an EF of [**10-7**]%, and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed emergently.
Repeat TTE on the following day revealed an EF of 50%.
Through her hospital course, she was up titrated on her beta-blocker and AceI as tolerated by her BP, with goals to maintain SBP <130 and HR <70.
DM: The pt has admission glucose of 700 (gap of 11) but reported no known diagnosis of diabetes.
ARF:  On admission to the CCU, Ms. [**Known lastname **] creatinine level was elevated to 1.8, likely secondary to the dye load received by the patient in the cath lab.
Although her hematocrit has been stable, in the setting of anemia and heart failure, she was electively transfused with one unit PRBC's.
