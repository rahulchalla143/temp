Pulse and blood pressure were regained and she was started on Neo-Synephrine as a pressor.
Cervical spondylosis, C6-7.
At that time, her vitals were a temperature of 97.1, heart rate of 158, blood pressure 137/76, respiratory rate 22, and 100% on 100% FI02.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The laboratories at that time showed a white count of 4.8, hematocrit 33.2, and platelet count of 221,000.
The Chem-7 showed a sodium of 138, potassium 3.4, chloride 109, C02 17, BUN 4, creatinine 0.4, and sugar of 65.
She had a PT of 16.6, PTT 31.2, and an INR of 1.8.
Her blood gas at that time was 7.27, 31, 451, 15, lactate 3.9.
The EKG at that time showed a narrow complex tachycardia with a rate of 150, Q waves were noted in III, aVF, V2 through V4.
The ST depressions were new compared with the prior done on [**2129-9-30**] on admission.
Enzymes were cycled which showed a CK of 121, MB 6, troponin 0.02.
Chest x-ray was performed at that time showing a left pleural effusion, endotracheal tube in place, and a left subclavian line placed during the code.
Emergent CT was acquired after stabilization which showed loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation consistent with early edema.
The MRI of the brain acquired prior to her arrest showed no acute territorial infarct.
MI was ruled out with serial enzymes and an echocardiogram in order to rule out pump failure as the cause of the hypotension.
She was bolused with normal saline and maintained on Neo to keep her CVP above 12.
The echocardiogram report showed that left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function were within normal limits with an ejection fraction of over 55%.
An EEG was ordered on [**2129-10-4**] which showed [**5-5**] second bursts, predominantly bifrontal.
There was a relatively low-voltage flow, theta background, but no normal background seen.
The EEG was read as abnormal, suggestive of severe diffuse encephalopathy.
She began to develop some temperature fluctuations treated with a Bear Hugger as well as some blood pressure fluctuations treated with fluid boluses.
She was apneic and auscultation revealed no heart sounds.
