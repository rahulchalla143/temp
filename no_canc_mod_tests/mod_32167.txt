The patient initially presented to the OSH ED the day of initial transfer s/p fall febrile to 104, hypotensive with a SBP of 58/p, and tachycardic to the 140s.
OSH CTH revealed an evolving SDH with an ABG of 7.48/22/78 on RA, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her initial vitals were T 103 BP 115/43 HR 104 after 2L NS, and T 99.8 after tylenol.
CT revealed an approximately 3mm of midline shift associated with the acute hemorrhage, but no intraventricular extension is noted.
CT c-spine demonstrated no acute fracutre or dislocation, although there were multilevel degenerative changes.
She was initially admitted to the ICU where lumbar puncture results were consistent with bacterial meningitis which on gram stain revealed GPCs in pairs and chains but a negative culture.
In the MICU, she was transfused 1 unit of platelets for a plt count of 38, was stable and was followed by neurology and neurosurgery, was stable and extubated and transferred out to the regular medical floor [**2175-7-3**].
A speech and swallow evaluation revealed chronic aspiration and she was made strict NPO and transferred back to the MICU in the setting of repeated desaturations.
ABG prior to intubation was 7.26/38/154 post extubation pH 7.30/36/115.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 15685**] is a 55 year old woman who was transferred from an outside hospital for further evaluation and treatment of a subdural hematoma, subsequently found to have bacterial meningitis.
Bacterial meningitis: Initial LP gram stain consistent with bacterial meningitis, likely Strep pneumo with questionable Listeria, although culture results were negative.
She had surveillance blood cultures on [**7-8**] that were negative.
Her serum sodium level corrected when the patient was able to tolerate PO on her own, and on the day prior to discharge her Na was 144.
The patient had several CT performed of her head, including on [**7-2**] and [**7-6**], which did not demonstrate any interval change.
The patient had a peak creatinine of 2.8 during her admission, and her creatinine on the day prior to discharge was 1.5.
Anemia: The patient had a mixed anemia with a high-normal MCV on admission with a HCT that trended down during her hospital course.
On [**7-15**] she was transfused with 2 units of PRBC, after which her HCT remained relatively stable.
On the day prior to discharge, her HCT was 27.8.
Upon extubation and transfer to the general medicine floor, she remained stable with good oxygen saturation on room air.
You will need to have a repeat CAT scan of your head as well as a follow-up appointment with the neurosurgeon.
