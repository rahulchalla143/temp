Per discussion with the floor nurse from his nursing home, a CXR was obtained 4 days prior to admission for a cough that was consistent with a pneumonia.
In the ED, initial VS were T 99, HR 120, BP 104/79, RR 24 satting 92% on NRB.
Labs showed WBC of 10.1, HCT of 43, plts 305.
LFTs showed AP of 214 otherwise WNL.
CMP showed hypernatremia of 150, Cl of 112, BUN 33, with rest of BMP in normal range,  Lactate was 2.1, and valproate level was 27.
ABG was checked and pH was 7.51, pCO2 of 28, pO2 of 72.
His CXR showed a questionable aspiration pneumonia as well as possible LLL process.
CT scan showed bilateral PE and likely pneumonia.
His blood pressure dropped to 70/40 just before transfer to the ICU.

CT OF THE CHEST:  There are small pulmonary arterial filling defects in the subsegmental bronchi supplying the lingula (4:71) as well as additional filling defect in the subsegmental right lower lobe bronchi (4:87).
Grayscale, color, and spectral Doppler examination of the right common femoral vein shows normal compressibility and flow.
ECHO [**2185-6-24**] - Echocardiographic Measurements Results  Measurements  Normal Range Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 55%  >= 55%  Findings LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**2185-6-26**] Compared with [**2185-6-25**] at 5:46 a.m., an NG tube is again noted.
CXR [**2185-7-6**] FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-5**], the orogastric tube has been removed.
Other monitoring and support devices remain in place.
CXR [**7-8**] Portable: IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification in left base with some volume loss.
CXR [**7-10**] Portable: IMPRESSION:  Possible area of loculated fluid with trapped air verses pneumothorax verses atypical appearance of stomach bubble near the left CPA.
Follow up upright chest radiograph with the patient swallowing 15 cc of barium just prior to imaging should help rule out these etiologies  CXR [**7-11**] PA/Lat: CONCLUSION: There is no significant pneumothorax.
ECG [**7-17**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-7-8**] the sinus rate has decreased by 20 beats per minute with no other diagnostic change.

Species on [**7-3**] was Alcaligenes achromobacter.
[**2185-6-24**] CTA showed bilateral pulmonary emboli in the segmental and subsegmental levels without evidence of right heart strain.
His INR has been difficult to manage, likely in setting of antibiotics, malnutrition, Levothyroxine.
As an outpatient, he should have his INR followed (check in 48-72hrs).
If his INR <2, he should be bridged with Lovenox 60mg q12h due to high risk for thromboembolism.
SBP <80s in the ICU requiring pressors.
# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine started this admission for TSH 8.6 in setting of acute septic shock.
TSH 7.8 on [**2185-7-9**].
- Will need outpatient psych follow-up - He will need close management of coumadin with goal INR [**12-24**] indefinitely.
Patient started on levothyroxine [**2185-7-3**] for low Triiodothyronine Thyroxine (T4), Free 0.78* and TSH 8.5.
Information was obtained from Patient.
Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen (5mg-500mg 1 TAB PO Q6H:PRN pain Monitor for sedation, RR < 8 14.

This required you to be in the intensive care unit on a ventilator for over 1 week and requiring medicine to keep your blood pressure normal.
After you had several days of antibiotics for your pneumonia, you were taken off the ventilator.
We have continued to change your dose depending on your INR (which needs to be between [**12-24**] to help prevent blood clots).
