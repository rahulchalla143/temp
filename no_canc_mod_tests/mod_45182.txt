The patient's last Swan-Ganz numbers prior to discontinuation of the catheter were cardiac output of 6 to 6.7, cardiac index of 3, pulmonary artery pressure of 46 to 60 over 19 to 29, CVP of 18 to 23.
His systolic blood pressure has been running in the 80s.
Therefore, we have made his holding parameters for captopril and Bumex to be held for systolic blood pressure less than 80.
Surveillance cultures from [**1-29**] and [**2-1**] were drawn which showed no growth.
An ultrasound of the area showed no fluid collection.
The patient's bilateral pleural effusions were tapped and did not show complicated pleural effusion or empyema.
The patient has had good saturations in room air.
His creatinine is now at his baseline of around 2.3.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition.
The patient's hematocrit has been stable in the interim.
Amylase and lipase were within normal limits.
Abdominal ultrasound was performed which showed normal liver and spleen, sludge in the gallbladder and small pericholecystic fluid.
twice a day, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 80.
twice a day, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 80.
DISCHARGE TREATMENT:  Daily blood pressure monitoring b.i.d.
Stagger Bumex and captopril doses a few hours apart.
Check BUN and creatinine and electrolytes twice a week.
