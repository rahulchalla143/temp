URINE CULTURE (Final [**2191-9-16**]):    NO GROWTH.
EKG: [**2191-9-14**]: tracing # 1: Narrow complex tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-11-13**] narrow complex tachycardia is seen and there are ST-T wave changes.
Echo [**2191-9-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Portable CXR [**2191-9-15**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Unclear why she had her prior (second) PE for which she received a course of 6 months coumadin.
She was stabilized in the ICU after her BP dropped s/p SL GTN in the ED and transferred to the floor.
Prescription was provided to check her INR and will be followed by her PCP Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 12646**].
According to the patient she was told by her visiting nurse 2 weeks prior to presentation that her pulse was not regular.
Subsequent EKG showed ectopic atrial rhythm with PAC's and PVC's.
Echo showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function in addition to Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
This was similar to an echo in [**2190**].
Her home diltiazem dose was halved given her bradycardia rate of 50's.
Her BP on discharge was 165/50 with HR of 52. .
She had 3 sets of cardiac enzymes which were negative.
She had a lipase of 100 in [**2189**].
Please check INR [**9-19**], [**9-21**], [**9-23**] of which the results will be faxed to her PCP 2.
You had low blood pressures requiring you to be admitted to the ICU where your blood pressure was stabilized.
