Recently, the chest pain has become more frequent ([**12-14**] x per day), and is no longer relieved with rest, but requires [**12-14**] nitros.
As a result of these symptoms, he presented for cath on [**2173-1-20**] at [**Location (un) 20338**] which showed LAD 60% proximal stenosis, RCA diffusely diseased with 90% discrete PDA.
R heart cath showed RA mean 8, PCWP 9.
L heart cath showed serial 90% lesions in a tortuous vessel with the PLB /PDA having origin 90% lesions.
A stat TTE was ordered which showed no evidence of pericardial effusion.
He was started on a NTG drip with drop in SBP to 80s and HR to 40s.

Conclusions: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
He pressetned with recent onset angina with an angiogram in [**State 108**] showing occluded LIMA to D, SVG to LAD and SVG to RCA.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections using a 6 French  [**Doctor Last Name **] 0.75 and a 6 French  [**Doctor Last Name **] .75 catheter, with manual contrast injections.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.
Arterial time = 2 hours 6 minutes.
A STAT echo after catheterization showed no evidence of pericardial effusion.
His pulsus was monitored Q6 the day following catheterization without elevation.
His CK peaked at 213 with a peak troponin T leak of 0.25 (normal 0-0.01) post-procedure and was down to 143 at time of discharge.
A repeat echocardiogram the day following catheterization showed only a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion and normal ejection fraction of > 55%, normal RV and LV cavity size.
His lipitor was increased to 40 once a day, his norvasc was decreased to 2.5 once a day and his imdur was decreased to 30 once a day, otherwise he was continued on his pre-cath medications including metoprolol 100 in the AM, 50 in the PM, ramipril 10 QD, and niacin, as well as aspirin and plavix.
