Post operative MRI requested on postop day two to evaluate for infarction, given that his neurologic exam was not improving.
MRI of the brain showed no infarct besides some compression of the brainstem at the level of the pons, therefore neurology consulted regarding "locked in syndrome".
Neurology recommended a repeat MRI to evaluate cerebral edema on [**2-5**] without significant change in the appearance of edema, no mannitol was given.
On [**2177-2-8**] patient started spiking fever up to 103 which continued until [**2177-2-18**] without a clear source all of his cultures were negative, HBV/HCV neg, ([**2-8**])CSF negative, except sputum culture grew E COLI.
