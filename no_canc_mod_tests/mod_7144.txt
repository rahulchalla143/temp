On the day of admission, the patients VNA found him diaphoretic and complaining of chest pain, which was exacerbated by exertion.
The chest pain was substernal and did not radiate.
At time of EMS arrival, his systolic blood pressure was in the 80's.
EKG was remarkable for diffuse anterolateral ST depressions and T wave inversions.
Cardiac enzymes were elevated: CK 703, MB 65, Troponin 0.59.
An echocardiogram revealed severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and extensive apical akinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was moderately to severely depressed with an ejection fraction of 30%.

Heparin was not continued as his prothrombin time remained supratherapeutic.
For several days, he remained pain free on medical therapy and cardiac enzymes continued to trend down.
He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**1-25**] which revealed a left dominant system with left main and LAD disease.
Left ventriculography revealed severe systolic dysfunction with anterior, anteroapical and inferoapical akinesis.
The ejection fraction was 25-30%.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed and showed no major change from a previous preop echocardiogram.
Given concern for ischemia as a source for his ventricular dysrhythmias, repeat cardiac catheterization was performed to assess graft patency.
An ICD was placed on [**2106-2-3**].
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0.
Digoxin levels were monitored and titrated accordingly.
