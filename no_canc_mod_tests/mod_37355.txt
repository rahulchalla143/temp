Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2150-10-22**], the left atrial mass is new.
Left ventricular systolic function is now severely impaired.
Since d/c drip and initiation of SC insulin, had intermittently high blood sugars to 400s, usually after meals; this was better controlled w/ higher basal insulin and tighter sliding scale.
W/ blood sugars <200 for 24hr period, felt that pt's pancreas may have more appropriate response - decreased lantus to 30U at bedtime and decreased ISS.
# thrombocytopenia - Pt had a left atrial clot seen on ECHO during this admission and was started on heparin drip.
However, pt's platelet count decreased by [**1-16**] within the next 24 hours.
Started argatroban and coumadin w/ INR initially in therapeutic range of [**4-20**] and within goal PTT of 60-80.
Two days after starting this regimen, INR was persistently elevated to 14.
According to [**Hospital1 18**] pharmacy guidelines, we felt that her INR was more than twice the level expected for concurrent coumadin/argatroban therapy (2 days total).
INR was 4.1; argatroban was discontinued.
The following day, her INR was 1.9.
Given that the bleeding risk w/ restarting argatroban was high, and HIT antibody was still pending, she was given a dose of coumadin 2mg and rechecked her INR in the afternoon.
She will need to have her level checked on [**1-18**] to ensure that coumadin is at therapeutic dose.
Digoxin and metoprolol for rate control, and she seems to be tolerating this well - would check digoxin levels after discharge.
Will schedule for repeat ECHO in 1 week.
# Hypotension - likely due to AFib with poor EF - SBP in 90s.
# Hypernatremia:  Had sodium levels up to 168 from NKHOS.
Last Na level was 143. .
# Acute Renal failure: pt had elevated creatinine 1.5 and GFR of 32 at admission which was attributed to pre-renal process.

Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): Please hold for SBP <100 or HR <55.
