Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Collapse of the right middle and lower lobes, unchanged from [**2145**].
- CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2147-4-12**] 7:43 PM - Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.
- VENOUS DUP UPPER EXT BILATERAL Study Date of [**2147-4-12**] 1:13 PM -  FINDINGS: Patent bilateral subclavian veins with normal phasic flow.
Patent bilateral cephalic, basilic, and subclavian veins.
Most recent TTE was notable for severe diastolic heart failure as well as mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
#GI bleed: On [**2147-4-18**], the patient had large amount of melena, along with hematocrit drop.
On [**2147-4-20**], the patient again had melena, along with a hematocrit drop.
GI re-scoped the upper GI tract and saw no new ulcers and a well-healing duodenal ulcer with clips still in place.
Patient continued to have maroon stool so she underwent a 3rd EGD on [**4-23**] which showed small, raised hyperemic area distal to previous duodenal ulcer that was clipped.
WBC count was 13.6 on discharge, stable, and improved from 18 a few days before.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - patient to discuss potential switch to peritoneal dialysis with her outpatient providers - possible workup of RML and RLL chronic collapse - monitor HD catheter insertion site, which has had some intermittent bleeding requiring pressure dressings.
- Pt should have PCP follow up made when discharged from rehab -- she will need to have a hematocrit drawn within [**2-6**] wks of discharge and if stable (last value stable at 29.6) then PCP should consider restart ASA 81 for AFib, if appropriate, with decision for full dose aspirin or Coumadin to be decided in conjunction with GI depending on ulcer healing and persistent risk of GI bleeding -Gastroenterology follow up appointment is being worked on and patient should follow up within 2 wks.
