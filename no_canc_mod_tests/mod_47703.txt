It was, therefore, decided to obtain an abdominal CT, which showed a recurrent right rectus sheath hematoma, approximately 4 x 8 cm, with contrast extending all the way to the colon indicating no obstruction.
At the same time, a chest x-ray was obtained, which showed a right middle/lower lobe opacity consistent with a pneumonia.
Blood cultures were also drawn and came back negative.
The patient also received a unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26.8 in the setting of her coronary artery disease.
