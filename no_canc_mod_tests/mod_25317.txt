In [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] ER he was found to have a HR in the 30 with otherwise normal VS. His ECG showed third degree heart block with junctional rhythm in the 30s.
His digoxin level was 1.2, troponin T 0.095.
In the ER his VS were: HR 30 BPM, BP 130/50 mmHg, RR 20 X', SpO2 100%.
His ECG showed third degree heart block with junctional escape rhythm at a rate of 30 BPM.
<br> Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Patient did have a potassium of 8.7, however this specimen was hemolyzed and a repeat returned 4.4.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-6-11**], the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new and c/w interim ischemia/infarction.
The estimated PA systolic pressure is also now higher.
He had a dig level of 1.2 at OSH and in the setting of renal insufficiency could be toxic.
EKG from OSH showed ventricular bigeminy and 3rd degree AV block with junctional rhythm, both of which can be seen with digoxin toxicity.
Digoxin was stopped and patients heart rate improved over hospitalization, to levels in the 60s at rest and up to 90s with minimal activity.
ECG showed ST depression in V3-V5 when given dopamine.
After discussion with the family and considering comorbidities and the patientis stability, cardiac catheterization was not pursued.
Echocardiogram showed regional LV systolic dysfunction that was new in comparison to [**2134-6-11**], likely representative of ischemia/infarction.
LV EF was 55%.
Troponin peaked at 3.63, CPK at 857, and CK-MB at 78.
# Renal insufficiency - Chronic per OSH records and daughter, with baseline creatinine between 1.5-1.7.
Creatinine between 1.6 and 1.8 during hospitalization.
Urine electrolytes indicated likely prerenal azotemia.
Daughter had some concern about his confusion and evaluation by by PT suggested rehab.
It was found that your heart rate was very slow and you also had a heart attack.
We treated your heart attack with blood thinners and took a picture of your heart that showed a small area of injury, but still good overall function.
New Medications: Aspirin 325 mg by mouth daily: important blood thinner to decrease risk of another heart attack Plavix 75mg by mouth daily: important blood thinner to decrease risk of another heart attack Lisinopril 5mg by mouth daily: Blood pressure medication that also helps your heart heal Atorvastatin 80mg by mouth daily: This medication lowers cholesterol to decrease risk of another heart attack  STOP: Digoxin .
