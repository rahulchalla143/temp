CXR ([**4-28**]): Patient's condition required AP and lateral chest examination while patient is sitting in wheelchair.
Comparison is made with a preceding single AP chest view of [**2118-4-26**].
Presence of barium contrast, apparently used for an oropharyngeal video study earlier during the day, discloses sizable hiatal hernia which apparently contributions to this retrocardiac density.
Heart size has not changed and previously described general widening and elongation of thoracic aorta remains the same.
CXR ([**4-30**]): Large hiatal hernia.
# Hypotension: Her blood pressure per NH report was 70/40.
Despite IV fluids in ED, BP was not responsive.
CXR showed left lower lobe infiltrate, concerning for pneumonia, along with SOB and cough.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
Cortisol level was normal.
With the above interventions her blood pressure improved to 95-110s systolic, and her mental status improved.
Her systolic blood pressure as time of discharge is in the high 90s to low 100s.
Neuro exam was non-focal and LFTs were unremarkable.
Her electrolytes showed a mild hypernatremia, which corrected with IV D5W.
She has passed speech and swallow evaluation and is tolerating oral diet without problem.
# Microcytic Anemia: Her baseline hematocrit is in the low 30s.
Hematocrit on this admission was 28.8.
Iron studies were indicative of deficiency (see above).
Her hematocrit remained stable, and her blood pressure came up with treatment of infection.
# Acute renal failure: Her baseline creatinine is 0.9-1.1.
Creatinine on this admission was 1.6.
Digoxin level in ED was within normal limits.
Her rate has been well-controlled in the 70-90s.
Her symptoms may have been due to underlying Crohn's disease (in the setting of holding Asacol while she was in the ICU), and we have restarted Asacol prior to discharge.
Urine output has been ~1500 cc/day, and renal function has been stable.
