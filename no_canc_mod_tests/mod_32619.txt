Given multiple cardiac risk factors, he underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and decrease LV function with an ejection fraction of 35%.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgical evaluation and treatment.

Workup included echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound - please see result section for results.
On postoperative day two, following removal of pleural chest tubes, chest x-ray was notable for a 15% right pneumothorax.
Over the next 24 hours, his oxygenation improved and he was re-extubated without incident.
Repeat CXR on POD 8 showed resolution of small right apical pneumothorax.
