CT neg for bleed, infarct, hyperdense MCA sign.

Radiologic Data CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: There is marked stenotic tapering of the superior division of the left MCA, just after the bifurcation.
An intraluminal filling defect is not identified.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK: The internal carotids, vertebral arteries, and basilar opacify without evidence for occlusion, dissection, or hemodynamically significant stenosis.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  Left frontal vertex diffusion abnormalities, with an appearance strongly suggestive of embolic infarcts in the superior division, left MCA distribution, likely correlating with the patient's acute symptoms.
ECHO [**2125-4-12**] Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
A patent foramen ovale is present(bubble study positive during cough and Valsalva maneuver release).
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%).
Various studies performed above showed that a PFO may have caused multiple emboli to reach the L MCA territory.
A hypercoagulable workup should be done as outpatient.
The INR will be followed as outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Coumadin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime: please have INR checked [**4-17**] and have the dose adjusted accordingly.
Please have your INR checked by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and have him dose the coumadin accordingly.
