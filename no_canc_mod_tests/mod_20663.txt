Severe systolic dysfuction with EF of 20% and global hypokinesis.
Extensive rheumatologic, infectious, endocrinologic work-up unrevealing (see labs above).
ETT MIBI performed on [**6-29**] under Modified [**Doctor First Name **] Protocol had exercise duration of 6 min with termination for fatigue and 89% of maximum heart rate obtained; ECG showed diffuse upsloping ST segment depressions and sinus rhythm without ectopy.
Stress images showed a partially reversible, moderate-severe myocardial perfusion defect involving the distal anterior wall and apex, consistent with LAD distribution.
Anterior wall is severely hypokinetic with EF of 44%.
Cardiac catheterization performed on [**6-30**] revealed a right dominant system with normal coronary arteries and no flow limiting disease.
Ventriculogram showed anterobasal, anterolateral, apical, inferior, and posterobasal walls that were hypokinetic with a calculated contrast ejection fraction was 36%.
Resting hemodynamics were normal with a mean PA of 21 mmHg, mean PA of 4 mmHg, RVEDP 7 mmHg, PCW mean 9 mmHg, LVEDP 14 mmHg, CO 4.1 L/min, CI 2.6 l/min/m2.
Patient euvolemic on discharge with a dry weight of 80.6 kg to be maintained with Lasix 20mg PO QD and afterload reduction with Lisinopril 40mg PO QD and Metoprolol XL 300 PO QD.
Cardiac catheterization on [**7-1**] showed normal coronary arteries.
Repeat echo in one month.
Consider electrophysiologic evaluation for risk stratification for an arrhthmic event (if depressed EF persists after time alotted for recovery from hibernating myocardium).
HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY: Found in the field with SBP > 200.
Nipride weaned off and BP controlled with PO meds consisting of: Metoprolol 300 mg PO QD, Amlodipine 10mg PO QD, Lisinopril 40mg PO QD, Clonidine patch.
Secondary hypertensive work-up negative for pheo (final labs pending at time of discharge, will be followed by med student and faxed to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**]), aortic coarctation, hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, cushings.
Patient discharged with normal blood pressures of 110-130s/60-80s.
CXR representative of CHF as well as focal opacification in the left lung base which could be a superimposed infection.
Sputum cultures negative.
On discharge, patient had O2 sats > 97% on RA, no shortness of breath, and able to ambulate without difficulty.
FEVER/LEUKOCYTOSIS: On admission, patient had a fever of 103 and leukocytosis with a WBC count of 34.9.
Sputum, blood, urine cultures were all negative.
CXR suggested a possible infection.
Patient underwent empiric 10 day course of Levo, Flagyl.
During hospital stay, fever resolved and WBC returned to normal.
