As a result he went to an OSH ER where a CT head showed diffuse SAH in the basal cisterns and b/l cerebral hemispheres.
He was loaded with Dilantin and then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain without contrast.
No prior brain imaging studies are available for comparison.
FINDINGS: The non-contrast CT demonstrates diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, with the greatest concentration in the suprasellar cistern.
The CTA examination demonstrates an aneurysm arising adjacent to the anterior communicating artery, and projecting to the left.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain without contrast material.
An axial perfusion CT run was performed during the infusion of IV contrast.
Subsequently, rapid axial images were performed from  the aortic arch through the brain during infusion of IV contrast material.
Images were processed on a separate workstation with display of mean transit  time, relative cerebral [**Name2 (NI) **] volume, and cerebral [**Name2 (NI) **] flow maps for the CT  perfusion study and curved reformats, volume-rendered images, and maximum-intensity projection images for the CTA.
COMPARISON: CTA head on [**2121-11-23**].
CT PERFUSION: The perfusion maps appear normal with no evidence of delayed transit time, or reduced [**Year (4 digits) **] flow or [**Year (4 digits) **] volume.
HEAD AND NECK CTAs: The study is slightly degraded by motion artifacts.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

He was admitted to the SICU for close observation and critical care after the intial CT scan showed SAH.
Angiography on 12.4 demonstrated ACOMM aneurysm at 7mm.
During cerebral angiogram on [**2121-11-20**] he had 7 coils placed with embolization.
He underwent a CTA on 12.8 and 12.11 which were without vasospasm.
His dilantin levels were followed and bolused appropriately.
He will follow up with his PCP for glucose control, BP control, sleep study follow up.
