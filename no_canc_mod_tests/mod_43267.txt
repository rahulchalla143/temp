Diagnostic tap of his ascites was negative.
CT showed a small SAH (later thought to be artifact on repeat) and he was dilantin/keppra loaded.
His initial labs were significant for a coagulopathy w/ INR=1.8 and plt=53 and he was given 1u plt, 2u RBC, and 1u FFP and sent to the MICU for further w/u.
In the MICU, his BP was stable in a normal range and he had a CXR showing a probable infiltrate along w/ ?
His labs were initially thought to be c/w a picture of DIC (low haptoglobin, low plt, low fibrinogen) but his OSH labs were eventually obtained and showed a chronic picture of liver failure (alt 71, ast 130, alp 719, tbili 1.2, alb 2.1, INR 1.6) along w/ pancytopenia (HCT 24.8 and plt 53).

[**7-27**] Rib X-Ray Nondisplaced fractures of the right posterolateral eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs with callous formation.
Diagnostic considerations include pneumonia  CT head [**2151-7-25**]: Likely a small focus of subarachnoid blood in the left parietal  occipital lobe.
CT spine [**2151-7-25**]: No evidence for cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
CT abd/pelvis: 1.
CXR ([**2151-8-3**]): 1.
KUB ([**2151-8-3**]): 1) Mild gaseous distention to loops of small bowel, with probable large bowel ileus affecting transverse colon.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2151-7-28**]):       OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
His blood pressure ranged from 95-110, and he had minimal urine output.
Ortho saw the patient, and recommended TLSO as soon as the patient could ambulate out of bed.
neurosurgery was consulted regarding the patient's neck CT showing possible spinal cord compression.
On [**7-30**], the patient was reporting improved breathing and pain, however, he experienced further diminished urine output and his blood pressure dropped to 90-100.
His creatinine also increased from .7 to 1.3, from [**Date range (1) 69675**].
hepatology initially diagnosed him with hepatorenal syndrome and recommended to discontinue the diuretics, and to add 25g of 25% albunmin [**Hospital1 **].
Later in the day the patient triggered with a temperature of 94.0, down from his baseline of 96-97.
He was given a warming blanket, and had blood cultures drawn.
In addition, his amylase and lipase started to rise despite not having any s/s of pancreatitis (no abd pain, no nausea, vomiting).
On [**8-9**], the amylase and lipase increase had begun to taper and the patient was ambulating, taking adequate po, voiding on own.
Pt needs to start antiretroviral therapy for Hepatitis B once amylase and lipase have normalized.
