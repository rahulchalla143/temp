He was taken to [**Hospital3 16673**], per ED report he had a CT Head which showed no acute intracranial bld, labs were significant for an INR 6.
Vit K 2.5 PO x 1.
In the ED initial VS were noted to be T97.9, HR 70, BP 120/70, RR 20, Sat 94% on 6L.
Labwork was notable for neutrophillic leukocytosis 14.4 (80N, L11), Hgb/Hct 14.8/43.1, plt 205.
Trop 0.03, Coags showed INR 9.3, PT 80.7, PTT 35.8.
They also repeated his CT head scan which showed no evidence of an acute bld.
It is unclear as to why the pt was given [**Name (NI) 39915**] 1gm, likely given the hypoxia and CXR which appears to be close to baseline.
The pt also underwent a cardiac catheterization given this question of biventricular failure and chest pain.
Cath showed severe native three vessel coronary artery disease, LMCA showed mild luminal irregularities, LAD was totally occluded in the mid vessel, LCx was occluded proximally, RCA was also totally occluded.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right ventricular filling pressures, RVEDP of 8mmHG.
Moderate pul HTN with a PASP of 51mmHg.
His pacer is [**Name6 (MD) 39917**] [**Name8 (MD) 39918**] CRT-P C2TR01, set to DDD at a rate of 70 bpm.
