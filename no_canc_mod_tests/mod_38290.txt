Of note the pt is s/p evaluation for percutaneous aortic valve replacement at the [**Hospital6 13185**] with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis last year but they felt her iliofemoral arteries were too small and tortuous for percutaneous approach.

POST VALVE DEPLOYMENT Both right and left ventricular systolic function are improved.
ECHO ([**5-25**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-4-6**], a Corevalve prosthesis is in place.
ECHO ([**5-31**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present and appears well-seated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-5-25**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher (but may have been underestimated in the prior study).
Post-procedure echo showed no gradient across aortic valve and only trace AR.
Beta blocker held for majority of admission but restarted prior to discharge once heart rate could tolerate.
[**Name (NI) **] has plans for repeat echocardiogram and cardiology appointment on [**2174-6-24**] with repeat labs prior to appointment.

Discharge Instructions: You had a percutaneous arotic valve replacement with a CoreValve device, the procedure went well and there were no complications.
You are recovering from the procedure well and an echocardiogram shows that the valve is working well and the pressures inside your heart are lower which is beneficial to your heart.
Start taking Aspirin and Plavix to keep the valve free of blood clots.
Start colace to avoid constipation on the iron 4.
