MRI Head [**3-17**]: TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was obtained through the brain prior to and following administration of contrast.
Small foci of hypointensity on gradient echo sequences are indicative of a small amount of intracranial blood.
Head CT [**3-17**]: FINDINGS: As on [**2102-3-15**], postoperative change including a bifrontal craniotomy and subsequent cranioplasty is again noted.
Head CT [**3-19**]: Since prior exam, a right frontoparietal approach, EVD drain is in place with its tip terminating along the inferior aspect of the falx in the region of the third ventricle.
LENIS [**3-21**]: BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Color Doppler and grayscale imaging of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate normal compression, augmentation, waveforms and flow.
On POD#1, the patient went to interventional radiology to undergo lumbar drain placement to assist in the managment of CSF leak.
On [**3-21**], flurosceine contrast was instilled, while ENT surgery observed with the use of a scope intranasally for CSF leak.
On [**3-23**], flurosceine testing was again repeated and determined that there was not an active CSF leak.
On [**3-24**] his external ventricular drain was removed, and two staples placed to approximate the wound.
Head CT was done immediately thereafter, and no hemorrhage was present.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
