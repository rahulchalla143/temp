Eventually, a repeat chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate and the patient was sent to the Emergency Room to be treated for pneumonia.
In the Emergency Room, a CT scan of the chest was obtained and showed dense consolidation in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe with a large loculated right pleural effusion.
The pleural fluid obtained was consistent with an empyema, however, the patient underwent bronchoscopy prior to VATS to rule out malignancy.
The patient was ruled out for a pulmonary embolism by CT angiogram and her acute desaturation was resolved with suctioning.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 98.2, heart rate 70, respiratory rate 25, blood pressure 133/38 and oxygen saturation 96% on two liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric sclerae, no pallor, mucous membranes dry, no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.
Pulmonary:  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation with bibasilar crackles.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 13, hematocrit 31.3, platelet count 547,000, differential with 88% neutrophils and 4% bands, sodium 133, potassium 3.7, chloride 92, bicarbonate 32, creatinine 0.8, glucose 147, phenytoin level 2.1.
Total fluid culture from original thoracentesis on the right side grew Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Sputum, blood and urine cultures drawn on [**2104-9-4**] were negative.
Pleural fluid obtained from the second thoracentesis on the left side was negative.
Blood, urine and sputum cultures drawn on [**2104-9-8**] are pending at the time of transfer.
STUDIES:  Chest x-ray obtained on the day prior to transfer showed a moderate right sided pleural effusion with a small left sided effusion.
CT angiogram obtained the day prior to transfer showed no pulmonary embolism, increasing left sided pleural effusion and a decreasing right sided pleural effusion.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound obtained ten days prior to transfer was negative.
Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head obtained four days after initial presentation to the hospital demonstrated hyperintense T2 signals in the brain stem thalamus and posterior parietal lobes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  (continued from time of transfer)  A repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head showed reversal of the above noted hyperintense T2 signal changes, however, the second magnetic resonance imaging scan did reveal an area in the posterior parietal lobe possibly consistent with a new small infarction.
A TSH level was drawn and came back elevated at 22, with a free T4 of 0.5.
Serial chest x-rays revealed persistent bilateral lower lobe atelectasis with a newly evolving left lower lobe infiltrate, which subsequently began to resolve.
After about one week on the floor, the patient began to express discomfort to palpation of the abdomen.
Liver function tests were sent and were mildly elevated.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained and was normal.
Several swallow studies were obtained after the patient discontinued her own nasogastric tube.
Her alkaline phosphatase remained persistently elevated at a level of about 185 and AST remained elevated at around 50.
GGT was elevated at 210.
