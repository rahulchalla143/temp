He presents to [**Hospital1 69**] for evaluation and coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
LABORATORY:  Laboratory examination included a white blood cell count of 8.2, hematocrit of 43.4, platelets of 306.
Sodium 137, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 99, bicarbonate of 28, BUN of 20, creatinine 1.2, glucose of 160.
PT 12.6, PTT 30.2, INR 0.9.
ALT was 20, AST was 26.
Total bilirubin was 0.5, albumin was 4.7, CK was 120 with an MB fraction of 2.8.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  The patient had a carotid Duplex done on [**2162-6-30**], which showed 40 to 59% stenosis bilaterally internal carotid arteries.
On [**2162-6-30**], he underwent a Myoview which showed a large fixed defect on the inferior wall, moderately visible defect at anterior wall, moderate early reversible defect on inferior apical wall and an ejection fraction of 29%.
EKG was sinus rhythm with a rate of 61 with Q waves in II, III, AVF, V2 through V6 and ST depression in III and AVF.
Preoperative chest x-ray showed no evidence of congestive heart failure.
He also underwent aortic valve replacement with a 22 mm pericardial valve which was secondary to a ricket deficiency noted on transesophageal echocardiogram done interoperatively.
Hemodynamically, the patient was weaned off of pressor support, was initially A-paced and the underlying rhythm was sinus rhythm.
The patient was able to maintain cardiac indexes greater than 2 with good urine outputs.
Initially, the patient's hematocrit was 22.0; he was transfused two units to a hematocrit of 27 and the patient's hematocrit remains stable.
On postoperative day number two, the patient's chest tubes and pulmonary artery catheter were discontinued.
The patient has been stabilized on a regimen of Lopressor which is providing adequate rate control with good blood pressure control.
