At [**Hospital1 **], he had a rate of 250 that fell to 140 with 6 mg of Adenosine.
In the [**Hospital1 **] ED, he was afebrile, BP 114/82-125/90, HR 115-125, RR 14, SpO2 1002-3L.

TTE 3.16 The left atrium is mildly dilated (5.4cm).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2170-8-10**], left ventricular function may be less vigorous.
He was found with a rate of 250 that did not break with adenosine.
We attempted to manage him with nodal agents, but these only lowered his blood pressure (to the 90's) while his heart rate was steady in the 120's.
Right carotid sinus massage (very light pressure was sufficient) effected a decrease in the ventricular response with a period of just flutter waves that also showed atrial repolarization or an "a" wave.
A long strip from the outside hospital additionally showed flutter waves.
However, his hypotension persisted after his cardioversion with blood pressures in the 60's to 70's systolic and after several boluses of phenylephrine with only 10 to 20 mm Hg rise in systolic blood pressure including well after he had been given fentanyl and propofol for the TEE and cardioversion he remained hypotensive requiring an arterial line and continuous phenylephrine intravenous infusion for hypotension which persisted after large volume of saline infusion (over 2 liters).
He was given amiodarone po the next day because of the concern of his compromised blood pressure even in sinus rhythm.
Overnight his blood pressure improved to over 100 systolic and the pressor was weaned and he was returned to the floor from the CCU.
FOLLOW UP: INR checks through Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]               FOLLOW UP: Patient placed on Amiodarone and will need liver, pulm testing at intervals to be determined by outpatient physicians.
2) Arterial Vasculopathy, confirmed at least by coronary calcification in all coronary vessels on chest CT and atheroma in the ascending aorta seen on TEE      Hx of CVA; his stroke is now considered thromboembolic given recent events.
His TEE showed "simple atheroma" in the aortic arch and the CT of the chest for evaluation of a question of a nodule showed calcium in all the coronaries.
In the hospital, ABI's were performed where he had bilateral systolics of 60 at the DP with brachial systolic of 90, indicating PAD.
4) COPD/Emphysema    CXR showed hyperinflated lung fields and a LLL opacity.
CT chest non-contrast showed multiple 1-3 mm nodules.
Ulcerative colitis - stable .
