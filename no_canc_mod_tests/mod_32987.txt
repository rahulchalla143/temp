Studies: CXR [**3-15**]: Markedly limited study.
EKG [**3-15**]: afib, rate 127, VPCs, RBBB .
Bronchoscopy [**3-24**]: No evidence of trauma, thin frothy pink secretions consistent with pulmonary edema.
# Sepsis: Patient met SIRS criteria with temperature >102 and hypotension with SBP 80s.
The patient was pan-cultured including urine, blood and sputum.
In addition, his R PICC line was removed and tip was sent for culture.
His urine was felt to be the source as cultures returned positive for >100,000 colonies of pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
Blood cultures were negative at the time of transfer.
A renal US was obtained that showed a normal right kidney without hydronephrosis.
Left kidney was not visualized due to body habitus.
His Cr continued to trend up and was 4.8 on [**3-20**].
His last HD session was [**3-23**] which he tolerated well.
# Respiratory distress: Admission CXR showed possible b/l infiltrates vs. pulmonary edema, however was extremely limited due to body habitus.
He was primarily maintained on PS ventilation 12/5, however patient was subjectively SOB and his pressure support was increased to 15 on [**3-20**] despite stable O2 sats.
A bronch was performed on [**3-24**] that showed ****.
His BB was uptitrated as his BP tolerated to a dose of 50mg tid.
His HR remained well-controlled with HR 80s-90s.
INR on day of discharge was 2.5 on a dose of 5mg coumadin.
