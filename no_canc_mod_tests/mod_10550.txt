He had abdominal pain, and he was guiac negative.
His initial creatinine was 15.3, his glucose was 162, and he had a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 24 (up from his baseline of 19, due to his chronic kidney disease).
He was given 2L IVF for hydration, and his anion gap closed to 20.
On transfer to the floor his vitals were: T 99.2, HR 100, BP 171/90, RR 12, O2sat 97% on room air.
On the medicine floor he had worsening nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, his glucose rose to 305, his gap increased to 21 and his pH was 7.27.

Blood cultures were sent and he underwent his 5th dialysis session.
But after brief stay on the regular medicine floor, his blood sugar elevated into the 200-300s and anion gap increased; acetone found in serum and ketones seen in urinalysis, concerning for DKA.
Patient's anion gap decreased to baseline ~17, given patient's underlying end-stage renal disease/uremia.
Of note, on [**2-20**], patient refused hospital diet and had his girlfriend bring him [**State 19827**] Fried Chicken; his blood sugars and anion gap increased.
Abdominal exam nonfocal but with tenderness initially that resolved.
Clostridium difficile toxin was sent and negative  Acute on chronic renal failure.
Initially on arrival to the MICU, hematocrit was 20, mildly below baseline of 25 and felt due to the combination of iron deficiency and CKD.
As discussed above, in the setting of recent initiation of hemodialysis and pending blood cultures, the patient was advised to remain in the hospital to be sure he was afebrile for 24 hours, without signs or symptoms of infection, and that his blood cultures remained negative.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Viral Gastroenteritis Diabetic Ketoacidosis Diabetes Mellitus type 1 CKD stage V, requiring initiation of hemodialysis   Discharge Condition: The patient is leaving AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE given his recent fevers, pending blood cultures, and recent initiation of hemodialysis.
While in the hospital, your sugars were elevated and you were found to have Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).
You [**Known lastname 28316**] a fever on [**2-24**] and again on [**2-27**], and blood cultures were taken to evaluate for any signs of blood infection.
