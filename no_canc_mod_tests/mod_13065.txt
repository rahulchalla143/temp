MRI [**12-9**]: .
Impression: Friability, erythema, congestion and erosion in the antrum compatible with portal gastropathy Grade I varices at the lower third of the esophagus Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Increase nadolol to 40 mg if tolerated from hemodynamic standpoint.
Evaluation of shaking episodes revealed that they were seizures AKA Epilepsia Partialus Continua.
Pt was noted to have guiaic positive stool which were followed along with following his hemocrit q12.
HCT was stabilized on the above regimen, he was cotninued on a PPI.
HCT at discharge was 30.2.
In terms of microbiology, he grew pan-sensitive E. coli from his sputum on [**11-11**] and coag-negative staph from a blood culture on [**11-12**]; and yeast and GNRs from a sputum of [**11-16**].
Creatinine peaked at 2.6 and improved to 0.5.
He was found to have coagulase negative Staph in one set of blood cultures from a periperhal site on [**2130-11-23**].
Repeated surveillance cultures from both his port-a-cath and the periphery were negative.
Other extensive neurologic workup, including LP, brain MRI and head CT, was unrevealing.
Examination revealed weakness in all muscle groups, most prominently in his hands, right more than left, arms more than legs, and distally more than proximally.
He underwent EMG on [**2130-11-30**] with "electrophysiologic evidence for a generalized, motor>sensory polyneuropathy with predominantly axonal features, of at least moderate severity and a superimposed mild, chronic, generalized myopathy.
His MELD scores were in the teens.
On discharge, MELD score was 0. patient will require close monitoring of lactulose administration and ensurance that no dosese are missed.
Video speech and swallow showed some aspiration initially, though this improved and the patient was cleared for regular solids, though nectar-thick liquids.
was re-evaluated by speech and swallow study on [**2130-12-22**] which showed significant improvement and was advanced to thin liquids, still requiring aspiration precautions.
His stools were guaiac negative and B12/folate were normal.
EGD was performed which showed an active gastritis.
He was transfused 2 units PRBCs on [**2130-12-19**] for a Hct of 23 to 29 post-transfusion.
A HIT assay was sent.
Lines: Indwelling Port (PortaCath) - placed at outside hospital because patient is reportedly very difficult to get access on & draw blood from.

Does have signs of encephalopathy on exam with trace asterexis vs. tremor, but significantly improved.
