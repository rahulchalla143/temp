Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2207-12-13**]: Grossly stable acute on chronic R hemispheric SDH and scattered R SAH; R cerebral sulcal effacement and ~6mm R-to-L MLS (was 5mm) with no herniation noted, final read pending, film reviewed with Neurorads.
CT head [**2207-12-14**] Interval enlargement of previously visualized right subdural hematoma with more of an acute component, more mass effect, and a greater shift of the normally midline structures.
CT head [**2207-12-15**] Interval decrease in thickness of the right convexity subdural hematoma, which may, in part, reflect redistribution and stable small left frontal subdural hematoma, with decreased leftward shift of normally midline structures.
CT head [**2207-12-16**] Stable overall appearance of bilateral subdural hematomas, with stable leftward shift of the normally-midline structures.
Focused examination demonstrates an abnormal, sludge-filled, distended gallbladder with wall edema, concerning for acalculous cholecystitis.
A hepatobiliary nuclear medicine scan with CCK may be of use if further assessment is desired.
Evaluation for portal hypertension can be achieved with Doppler ultrasound if desired.
EEG [**2207-12-16**] This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the presence of a slow background which reached a maximum of 4 Hz frequency.
EEG [**2207-12-17**] Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm.
CT head [**2207-12-17**] No significant change in the size of the right-sided subdural hemorrhage with mild mass effect on the cerebral hemisphere, cerebral edema and shift of the midline structures to the left side along with mass effect on the right lateral ventricles; along with a few foci of hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe at the vertex.
EEG [**2207-12-18**] This video EEG telemetry was abnormal due to the presence of a slow, disorganized background that was usually in the delta frequency range with superimposed bursts of generalized delta slowing, often with a bifrontal predominance.
ECHO [**2207-12-18**] The left atrium is elongated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2204-4-16**], the right ventricle is now dilated and hypocontractile, and the left ventricle is now hyperdynamic .
EEG [**2207-12-19**] This video EEG telemetry is abnormal due to the presence of a slow, disorganized background, mostly in the delta frequency range, with bursts of generalized slowing.
EEG [**2207-12-20**] This EEG gives evidence still for intermittent PLEDs-like discharges in the right central temporal region.

Abd X-ray [**2207-12-27**] In comparison with the study of [**12-29**], the tip of the nasogastric tube is in the region of the esophagogastric junction with the side hole in the lower esophagus.
Chest X-ray [**2207-12-29**] In comparison with earlier studies of this date, the side port of the nasogastric tube again lies above the diaphragm.
CT head  [**2207-12-30**] IMPRESSION: Incomplete study with substantial artifact limiting evaluation for interval change.
CT HEAD [**2208-1-3**] IMPRESSION: Limited study, demonstrating interval evolution of right subdural hematoma, without increase in size.

He remained neurologically intact but repeat CT of head [**12-14**] showed expanding SDH.
He demonstrated a significant coagulopathy on admission with an INR of 17.5 and a PTT of 133.2 which was reversed with oral/IV vitamin K and 2U FFP in the ER at [**Hospital1 18**].
Repeat INR/PTT revealed improvement, but he required another 2U FPP.
Patient's mental status was declining along with neurologic exam and repeat imaging documented progression of his right sided SDH.
His INR was 1.8 pre-op and platelets 81 pre-op.
Repeat imaging 4 hours post-op showed improvement of his right SDH with post-surgical changes and no complications.
On [**12-16**], his neurologic exam demonstrated continued difficulty with arousal and the patient followed minimal commands with slight response to noxious stimuli.
His neuro exam was followed by the neurosurgery service, and NSG continued to follow the patient after the pt was transferred to the Medical service for management of his tachypnea and atrial fibrillation (see below).
Chest x-rays demonstrated pulmonary edema, and the patient was aggressively diuresed.
An ECHO was also done which showed an EF of 80% and right heart strain.
Prior to the CTA, an IVC filter was placed (as suspicion was high and a CTA could not be done at the time [**3-3**] high Cr).
Also, the patient had a Cx that was positive for Moraxella, and so was treated with abx (broad spectrum, then narrowed to cefepime for 8 days).
daily weights and strict Is/Os were done and he was diuresed with a goal of negative 1.5-2L per day.
Out of concern for underlying reasons for the Afib/RVR, the patient was treated for pain with fentanyl/dilaudid/lidocaine patch, and labs were sent to r/o other causes (pt has a normal TSH/Free T4).
This was done and the patient's heart rate was controlled to the 80s-100s range.
For that reason, the pt underwent an MRI of the C, T, and L spine.
The MRI revealed no acute pathology or cord compression to account for the weakness.
Prior to this, the pt had an active type and screen, and his Hct was monitored daily to [**Hospital1 **].
At time of d/c, his Hct was stable between 27 and 30. .
# Hypertension - The pt's BP was normotensive to hypotensive with the titration of nodal agents for his a-fib.
We stopped the pt's atenolol that he was on as an outpatient as his BP is normotensive on the new regimen for A-fib.
The pt self-d/c'ed his NGT, and after an unsuccessful attempt to replace it, he underwent a PEG placement after a family meeting was called and it was deemed in line with his healthcare goals.
On clinical exam no fluid filled area, slight erythema along midline without inflammatory signs.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical Care-[**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS - Subdural Hematoma  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES - Subarachnoid hemorrhage - Intraparenchyma hemorrhage - Atrial Fibrillation - Hospital Acquired Pneumonia - Polyneuropathy of Critical illness - Gout arthropathy vs. Bursitis  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
You also weren't moving your legs too much after the procedure, and so an MRI was done which showed nothing that could account for your weakness.
Please wear compression stocking and/or pneumoboots to prevent blood clots.
