An echocardiogram done at [**Hospital3 1443**] revealed 3 to 4+ severe eccentric mitral regurgitation with an ejection fraction of 60%.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization on [**2158-1-10**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile, pulse 80, blood pressure 123/81.
Cardiovascular irregular rhythm, 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur loudest along the left sternal border.
Respirations, lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC white blood cell 6.4, hematocrit 40.2, platelets 164.
Chemistry sodium 135, potassium 2.9, BUN 32, creatinine 1.1, glucose 118.
Coagulation   PT 13.7, PTT 39.0, INR 1.3.
ALT 23, AST 22, alkaline phosphatase 73, amylase 76, total bilirubin 1.2.
Electrocardiogram done at that time demonstrated 78 beats per minute, patient in atrial fibrillation, probable old inferior infarct changes, lateral T wave changes, nonspecific.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2158-1-10**].
The results of this cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 4+ mitral regurgitation with a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 45%, moderate diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis, right dominant coronary artery.
Following his cardiac catheterization the patient was referred to Cardiothoracic Surgery Service for repair of his mitral valve.
Following the cardiac catheterization the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service and placed on heparin intravenously, Lasix, Lopressor, and Percocet.
An ultrasound of the hematoma revealed a right femoral pseudoaneurysm.
The patient also experienced several hours of frequent premature ventricular contractions and trigeminy, but his electrolytes were within normal limits and the patient was asymptomatic.
An electrocardiogram was done at that time, which demonstrated a first degree AV block and ST segment depressions in leads 3 and AVR.
The patient's oxygen saturation continued to do well and he was weaned down to 2 liters and was able to be out of bed.
INR on this date was 1.2.
The patient continued to remain in atrial fibrillation, but with excellent rate control heart rates approximately 70s to 80s and the patient is asymptomatic.
to be adjusted to maintain INR 1.8 to 2.2.
