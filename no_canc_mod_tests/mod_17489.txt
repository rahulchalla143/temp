Systolic blood pressure was in the 160s on arrival, heart rate in the 80s, and she is in sinus rhythm.
Temperature at the outside hospital was 96.1.
AccuChek was 143.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs revealed temperature 96.1, heart rate 92, blood pressure 140/110, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 92% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - sclera clear.
Chest - Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.
Neurologic examination - mental status - alert and oriented.
Motor - bilateral grasp is [**6-5**].
Coordination - fine finger movements intact bilaterally in hands.
LABORATORY DATA:  On [**2148-6-3**], white blood count 10.3, hematocrit 30.7, and she was transfused throughout the hospital course to attempt to keep the hematocrit above 30.0.
Platelet count was 269,000.
INR on [**2148-6-3**], was 1.4.
Partial thromboplastin time was 63.8.
Prothrombin time was 14.5.
Fibrinogen was 294.
Reticulocyte count 1.9.
Protein B 121 which is normal.
Urinalysis on [**2148-5-28**], was positive.
Repeat urinalysis after treatment on [**2148-6-3**], is now negative.
Glucose 120, blood urea nitrogen 10, creatinine 0.7, sodium 140, potassium 4.4, chloride 107, bicarbonate 27 on [**2148-6-3**].
ALT 19, AST 15, LDH 154, alkaline phosphatase 58, amylase 11, total bilirubin 0.5.
Lipase 17.
Calcium 8.9, phosphate 4.3, magnesium 2.4.
Triglycerides 103, HDL 54, LDL 103, homocysteine 5.9.
TSH 0.77.
Urine culture was growing Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterococcus species, both of which are pansensitive.
Sputum culture was no growth.
Protein S 68 which is within normal range.
Initial magnetic resonance scan of the head showed bilateral pica infarcts, also an aneurysm clip causing loss of signal, inability to evaluate in distal right internal carotid artery M1 and A1 segments.
Angiogram on [**2148-5-23**], showed multiple areas of thrombosis including right vertebral artery thrombosis, left pica thrombosis, stenosis at the origin of the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery as well as stenosis of the left vertebral artery in both its proximal segment above the level of C5 vertebral body as well as the level of C1 vertebral body, approximately 50%, as well as distal intracranial left vertebral artery stenosis greater than 60% but with a patent basilar artery and collateral flow as described in the results.
Serial head CT proved stable.
There was never any herniation or change in the CT.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2148-6-1**], showed no evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of 40%, left and right atrium normal in size, left ventricular wall thickness normal with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mitral valve showed trivial mitral regurgitation seen.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted, initially transferred, and underwent angiogram revealing occluded right vertebral artery and stenosis in the left vertebral artery in addition to her pica infarcts bilaterally.
Transthoracic echocardiogram showed incidental clot in the heart although the infarcts were thought to be due to artery-artery emboli from the vertebrals.
Hypercoagulable workup was originally sent because initially the clot in the heart was found, though likely this clot formed because of the akinetic apex.
The hypercoagulable workup revealed elevated lipoprotein A.
The patient was started on Heparin on the day of admission especially given this clot in the heart and she was continued on Labetalol drip to control her blood pressure to keep it in the systolic range of 120 to 160.
The repeat head CT showed signs of cerebellar edema, but no herniation.
Anemia workup was sent and her stool guaiac was negative.
Chest compressions were given for about one minute when the patient became asystolic and the patient was intubated.
Head CT at that time was unchanged.
It is unclear as to whether some of her somnolence may have been due to CO2 narcosis and so today she has been maintaining oxygen saturation in the low to mid 90s and has become more awake, is doing well on oxygen by nasal cannula.
Hydralazine for her blood pressure and is off the Labetalol drip.
Currently she is being transfused for hematocrit less than 30.0.
Endocrine wise, she does have evidence of diabetes mellitus with a hemoglobin A1C of 6.0.
