No structural heart disease (had TTE w/ EF of >55%, no LV dysfunction or aortic stenosis, no septal defects or vegetations), no ischemia (EKG w/o any evidence of this, all cardiac enzymes were negative), ingestions of medications, (pts serum Benzo positive).
TIA and seizure were considered less likely on the differential, so Carotid doppler U/S and EEG were deferred and can be done on an outpatient basis.
Due to continued bradycardia w/ symptomaticity (hypotension), and a rpt Head CT on 7.25 showing increased midline shift, he was taken to the OR on 7.25 for SDH evacuation and given a pacer.
Because the patient lives in [**State 350**], Lyme serologies were sent and were found to be negative.
He was then re-transferred back to the MICU for monitoring, and after SDH evacuation, his HR improved and his temporary pacing wire was removed.
# SDH/HA: His SDH from [**2170-8-1**] fall was stable in size from previous admission, with a minimal midline shift only slightly increased from admission per Head CT. Pts phenytoin level 14.9 on admisison.
WBC trended down to 9.8 on discharge.
His CXR showed no evidence of PNA, and urine analysis was negative.
His WBC increased to 14 on [**8-13**] and trended down to 10.2 on the day of discharge.
His BP improved w/ 1 Liter NS Bolus x1.
On the floor, his blood pressure was stable and he did not require further anti-hypertensive medication.
HA did not change in character, and was classified as dull, L sided, constant, nonphotophobic and without N/V and neurological symptoms.
