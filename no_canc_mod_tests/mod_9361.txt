His blood pressure was 183/141, and therefore he was taken for a CTA to rule out aortic dissection.
PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ADMISSION:  Temperature is 96.6, blood pressure 175/128, pulse 92, respiratory rate 16, and 96% on room air.
Jugular venous pressure is not elevated.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
White count 10.8, hematocrit 45.8, platelets 154, chloride 142, potassium 3.9, 105 for chloride, bicarb of 22, BUN of 11, creatinine 0.9, glucose 110.
Differential on the white count was 82% neutrophils, 12% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 1.5% eosinophils.
PT is 13.6, PTT is 28.9, INR 1.2.
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate or effusion.
CT scan showed bilateral large pulmonary embolism, splenic infarct, and chronic infrarenal, aortic, or right common iliac dissection.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 84.
Given that the patient had bilateral pulmonary embolism discovered on CTA, patient was put on Heparin for a PTT of 60-80.
Patient was then sent for MRI of the pelvis which showed no evidence of clot in the femoral vein or IVC.
However, he was found to have high levels of homocystine at 70.5, where the high range of normal is 12.4.
His prothrombin gene mutation and factor-[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12843**] were still pending.
He was then started on Coumadin 5 mg to reach an INR between [**3-3**].
The echocardiogram actually revealed a patent foramen ovale with a right-to-left shunt in light of a normal pulmonary pressure with PR gradient of 17 mm Hg.
Also noted on the echocardiogram was preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, mild right ventricular dilation, mildly depressed right ventricular function, and apical-septal aneurysm.
He was given 48 hours of Vancomycin along with other antibiotics which he was taking for his pneumonia until blood cultures were clear for 48 hours.
The blood cultures did remain negative for 48 hours, so the Vancomycin was discontinued.
He is to be on Coumadin with INR of 2.3 for at least six months.
When the patient spiked a fever on hospital day five, a chest x-ray was obtained along with blood and urine cultures.
The chest x-ray revealed a left basilar infiltrate and left pleural effusion.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:  The patient is to followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**2200-2-26**] for blood pressure and INR check.
