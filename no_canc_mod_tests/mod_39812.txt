With his cough, he developed left-sided flank/chest pain, which he attributes to musculoskeletal pain from constant coughing.
He presented to his cardiologist/PCP for and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for a CXR (which he did not get due to time constraints.)
A CTA was negative for PE but showed a large pericardial effusion; a CXR showed bilateral pleural effusion and cardiomegaly.

EKG [**2191-11-25**] shows NSR with rate of 90.
ETT performed on [**3-28**] demonstrated: INTERPRETATION: 66 yo man was referred for a CAD evaluation.
CTA ([**2191-11-25**]): No pulmonary embolism.
CXR ([**2191-11-25**]): TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Cardiomegaly has increased, and is now associated with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Echo [**2191-11-26**]: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%) with anteroseptal/anterior/apical hypokinesis.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of 770 ml of bloody fluid.
Initial hemodynamics revealed evidence of pericardial tamponade, with increased right sided filling pressures with mean RA pressure 18 mm Hg.
There was also elevated left sided filling pressure with PCWP mean of 22 mm Hg.
Initial pericardial pressure was 18 mm Hg, with a pulsus paradoxus of 15 mm Hg.
Pre-procedure cardiac index was 2.7 l/min/m2.
Post-pericardiocentesis, RA pressure decreased to 10 mm Hg with the reappearance of y descents on the tracing.
There was also a substantial increase in cardiac index to 5.0 l/min/m2.
Pericardial pressure decreased to 0 mm Hg.
An Echocardiogram revealed minimal residual pericardial fluid with normal RA and RV diastolic wall motion.
Echo [**2191-11-30**]: There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the anterior septum.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-11-29**], the effusion is similar in appearance.
Pericardial fluid cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pleural fluid cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
# Pericardial effusion: On admission, patient had elevated JVP and distant heart sounds with a pulsus of 10.
Echocardiogram was significant for tamponade physiology.
Repeat echocardiogram demonstrated continued tamponade physiology, and pericardiocentesis was performed.
He was monitored in the CCU and follow-up echocardiograms confirmed that the pericardial effusion was not reaccumulating.
Work-up for the cause of the patient's pericardial effusion was significant for CRP of 125.
Thyroid studies revealed subclinical hypothyroidism.
PPD was placed and was negative, although the patient did have close contact with his grandfather, who died of tuberculosis.
Cytology was negative for malignancy.
Culture data was still pending at the time of discharge.
Cytology was negative for malignancy.
Culture data and AFB were negative at the time of discharge.
He will have a CT of the chest and follow-up with pulmonary in [**3-27**] weeks to monitor him for reaccumulation of his pericardial and pleural effusions.
After his pericardiocentesis, he had no further episodes, and remained in normal sinus rhythm.
He was discharged with a heart monitor to confirm that his AFib had resolved.
After resolution of his AFib, his blood pressure ranged from 100-120 systolic with a heart rate in the 70s on the higher dose.
His sugars were elevated in the 200s, and he was given glipizide with improvement in his blood sugar.
His vital signs were stable and he was afebrile.
Medication changes: - Metoprolol increased to 100mg twice a day.
You need another CT scan of your chest to make sure the fluid is not reaccumulating.
