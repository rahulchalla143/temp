She underwent a preliminary workup there which included an inadequate cervical spine, chest x-ray which showed multiple left-sided rib fractures and an inadequate pelvis x-ray.
She denied any loss of consciousness and was Medflighted to the [**Hospital6 1760**] directly from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital for evaluation of multiple head and face injuries.
She arrived at the [**Hospital6 256**] with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of 15 out of 15.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination at the time she was afebrile with stable vital signs.
In general she was obese, intoxicated with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of 15.
Her head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was significant for a 10 to 15 cm laceration of the posterior scalp over the occiput through the galea down to the skull.
Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm.
Her extremities, right shoulder demonstrated 1 to 2 cm laceration over the deltoid.
LABORATORY DATA:  Her admission hematocrit was 41.6 with white count of 21.7.
Her coags were within normal limits as were her chem-7 with a BUN of 14, creatinine 0.6.
Her urine toxicology demonstrated opiates and alcohol.
A trauma series was first performed which was significant for the following:  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax with clear lungs, no fractures documented.
The patient was taken to the computerized axial tomography scanner where multiple radiographic studies were performed including a computerized tomography scan of the head which demonstrated no masses, midline shift or hemorrhage, normal ventricles, no extra axial fluid collections, significant right orbital soft tissue swelling with fractures of the lamina papyracea, medial orbital wall and opacification of the right-sided ethmoid air cells.
The cervical spine was notable for no fractures or dislocations from C7 to T1.
The were visualized aspects of the cervical cord were unremarkable as were the lung apices.
The patient subsequently underwent a computerized tomography scan of the torso and pelvis that was significant for the following: Great vessels, trachea, esophagus and heart were unremarkable.
The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, adrenals and kidneys were all normal.
The patient underwent multiple radiographic films including the shoulder, chest and elbow as follows:  The shoulder showed no fractures visible; the elbow demonstrated normal alignment and articulation without any fractures.
The patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further observation.
Their evaluation was notable for no diplopia and no evidence of medial rectus entrapment.
An oromaxillofacial surgery consult was obtained for the orbital fractures which requested a orbital computerized tomography scan for further evaluation and the patient was noted to have a very large scalp avulsion type injury which was irrigated in the Intensive Care Unit with 1 liter of normal saline, infiltrated with lidocaine.
A re-evaluation of the patient's computerized tomography scan demonstrated a right lamina process T9 fracture.
She underwent an magnetic resonance imaging scan at this time of her thoracic spine which was inadequate.
She also underwent a repeat computerized tomography scan of the orbits and sella which demonstrated both medial and inferior wall blow-out fractures.
