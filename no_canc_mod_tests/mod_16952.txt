The patient was unresponsive to voice, and vital signs revealed a temperature of 99.5, heart rate was in the 70s, and blood pressure was 90/50.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation.
His systolic blood pressure was in the 70s.
He was intubated for airway protection and taken to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
Of note, the patient had guaiac-positive brown stool in the Emergency Department, and his laboratory studies were significant for a hematocrit of 32 (which is the patient's baseline) and a creatinine of 3.3 (which was elevated from a bowel sounds of 1).
The patient was given 2 liters of normal saline, and his blood pressure improved to 120 systolic.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 98, heart rate was 72, blood pressure was 130/70, respiratory rate was 14, and oxygen saturation was 100% on ventilator.
Head and neck examination revealed pupils were minimally reactive and mild bloody secretions from the mouth; likely secondary to traumatic nasogastric tube placement.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Rectal examination revealed soft brown guaiac-negative stool.
Neurologic examination revealed flaccid extremities but increasing rigidity of the upper extremities with full range of motion.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory studies revealed the patient's hematocrit was 31.9 (unchanged from baseline of 32).
Chemistry-7 panel was significant for a blood urea nitrogen of 53 and a creatinine of 3.3.
Initial creatine kinase was 724 with a troponin of less than 0.3, MB was 12, and index was 1.7.
INR was within normal limits.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax, no pneumonia, and proper placement of the endotracheal tube.
A head computed tomography revealed no acute bleed, with normal ventricles and fossae, with no mass effect.
Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with normal axis and intervals.
An electroencephalogram was normal, and a transthoracic echocardiogram was a limited study but demonstrated no significant valvular abnormalities.
Blood cultures were negative, and the patient remained afebrile throughout and demonstrated no evidence for infection or sepsis.
He maintained good blood pressures with continued intravenous fluids and was extubated on the second hospital day.
His creatinine improved to baseline with intravenous fluids.
His creatinine remained normal with oral intake.
His hematocrit increased appropriately and remained stable at 35 status post transfusion.
He had intermittently guaiac-positive stools, and further investigation revealed that he had not had a recent colonoscopy.
An outpatient colonoscopy was arranged for further evaluation and will be followed up by the patient's primary care provider.
The patient was to have an outpatient colonoscopy on [**2118-4-13**] with Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 3613**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
