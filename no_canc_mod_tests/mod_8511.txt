He was undergoing an evaluation for hypertension and had a CT scan which showed a left adrenal mass which is probably not malignant or active, but was found quite incidentally to have a 5.5-cm aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta.
He had a positive stress test and ultimately [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1834**] cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty and stenting.
Blood pressure was 140/90 in the left right arm and 138/86 on the right.
Pulse was 60 and regular.
He had palpable femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally with no suggestion of peripheral aneurysm.

The kidney rest was raised and the table broken, and the flank, abdomen, and groins were prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.
The retroperitoneal tissues over the anterolateral surface of the aorta were then divided down to the left common iliac artery, which was also exposed.
We then did an end-to-end anastomosis between the graft and the proximal aorta using a running continuous felted technique such that the strip of felt was buttressing the outside of the aortic wall.
The distal portion of the aorta was quite smaller than the proximal end and it was clear that there was a size discrepancy between the graft and the aorta.
The patient did drop his blood pressure to about 80 mmHg, but this responded rapidly to volume replacement.
Once the blood pressure had stabilized, flow was reestablished into the left leg without any difficulties.
A single pericostal stitch of #1-PDS was used posteriorly.
On POD 3 his platelets count dropped to 75 so his heparin was stopped and anti-heparin antibody was found to be negative.
He received an additional 2 units on POD 4, and this time his hematocrit bumped appropriately and subsequently remained stable.
All cultures were negative.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
New or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions   Followup Instructions: Followup with your primary care physician for blood pressure control.
