Pt was found to be in a fib, and a CT of abdomen was done, which revealed a 6cm mass in the region of the head of the body of pancreas.
A clot was found and random duodenal biopsies were taken.
Patient then dropped her SBP and found to be in afib with RVR with ST depressions in V3-V6 and with supratheraputic INR at 7.
Patient then dropped her HCT from 33- 28 and noted to be bleeding from NGT and Rectal tube.
Patient transfused PRBC and HCT stabilized.

IMPRESSION: No interval change compared to the study of one day prior of bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities.
[**2100-12-1**]  CTA abdomen/pelvis: CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A chest tube is noted on the left, with a small pneumothorax.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Extensive diverticula are seen within the sigmoid colon, without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the above findings, and were essential for diagnosis.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
[**2100-11-22**] pleural fluid negative for malignant cells  [**2100-11-15**]: gastric mucosal biopsies A.  Antrum:      1.

GI bleed at outside hospital - EGD was done, scope could not be passed past duodenal bulb; clots were found.
Duodenal biopsies take; Hct dropped from 33 to 28; pt was found to be bleeding from NG tube and rectal tube.
Transfused PRBCs, Hct stabilized, and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup of ?pancreatic mass found on CT abdomen, as well as [**Hospital1 4939**] EGD.
EGD biopsies were benign but felt to be nondiagnostic.
Hct has been stable since then, with a Hct of 31.4 on discharge.
2.  empyema/pneumonia - pt was noted to be hypotensive with a rising leukocytosis initially thought to be due to aspiration.
CXR showed a LLL pneumonia with a left sided pleural effusion, and hypotension was thought to be due to sepsis.
There, MRSA grew from sputum, as well as from pleural fluid.
Sputum from another culture also grew out Pseudomonas which was sensitive to ceftazidime; pt placed on ceftaz for a 14 day course ([**Date range (1) 59850**]).
CHF - EF was 55% on last echo, but pt with severe TR and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CTA was negative for PE.
EKG changes at OSH and here show ST depressions and TWI diffusely felt to be demand ischemia.
6.  pancreatic/duodenal mass - initially noted on CT abdomen at OSH.
[**11-30**] CT abdomen showed mass to be unchanged.
[**12-1**], a CT angio was performed, which showed that the mass was not pancreatic and is most consistent with post-inflammatory changes.
Plan is for repeat CT angio in 1 month (scheduled for [**12-31**]), and there is no need for endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy as was originally planned.
An NGT was placed on [**11-27**] with tube feeds.
A repeat speech and swallow study may be needed, as pt's aspiration may be due to transient oropharyngeal issues in the setting of repeated intubation.
9.  hearing loss - pt was noted to be more hard of hearing, and according to the son, this may have happened somewhat acutely, around the [**12-3**].
ENT evaluated the patient and thought that an outpatient audiogram with ENT [**Month/Year (2) 4939**] would be most appropriate to further characterize the hearing loss.
