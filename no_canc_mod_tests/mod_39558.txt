She was brought to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department immediately where she underwent a magnetic resonance scan with diffusion weight imaging and an intracranial MRA.
The magnetic resonance scan showed mild diffusion hyperintensity in the deep white matter on the left in the region of the internal capsule and periventricularly.
Her vascular risk factors are negative including no history of smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cardiac history or diabetes mellitus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was afebrile, blood pressure 130/56, heart rate 60 to 65, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 99% in room air.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Funduscopic examination appeared normal.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, complete blood count showed white blood cell count 9.0, hematocrit 36.6, platelets 299,000.
Coagulation studies showed prothrombin time 12.0, INR 1.0, partial thromboplastin time 27.8.
CK and troponin were negative.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  On admission as above included magnetic resonance scan which showed the subtle area of restricted effusion within the left corona radiata and absence of flow within the visualized intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery and left middle cerebral artery on MRA.
Over the following hours following the TPA, the patient's neurologic examination was not significantly changed.
On the morning after admission, the patient's neurologic examination was significantly improved with increased verbal output but with slow and effort speech as well as grammatical and paraphasic errors.
Her motor examination was also significantly improved with being able to lift the right arm off the bed and with antigravity strength in right triceps.
MRA of the neck was done to evaluate for carotid dissection.
Repeat MRA of the head showed some visualization of the M1 and M2 segments of the left middle cerebral artery in comparison with the prior study.
Repeat magnetic resonance scan of the brain showed large left basal ganglia infarct involving the head of the left caudate nucleus, anterior limb of the left internal capsule as well as the left lentiform nucleus.
Transesophageal  echocardiogram was done to evaluate for any cardiac source of emboli.
This showed no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and systolic function were normal with left ventricular ejection fraction over 55%.
She remained on the intravenous Heparin and Coumadin until her INR reached 1.9 and at that point the intravenous Heparin was discontinued.
Her neurologic examination continued to improve each day throughout her hospital course.
At the time of her discharge, her neurologic examination was significant for a transcortical motor aphasia with normal repetition, normal comprehension and fluent speech though with significant difficulties with naming.
The right sided hemiparesis significantly improved to full strength at the right deltoid, triceps, wrist extension and finger extension, though her examination did show some motor inattention with the right hand.
Her sensory examination was normal at the time of discharge.
with monitoring of her INR at home.
The INR will be checked this week on Wednesday which is two days after discharge and the next Friday as well as two times next week.
Her goal INR is 1.9 to 2.5.
Her INR results will be called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3029**].
