There, he was noted to have sinus bradycardia on an electrocardiogram with a rate in the 30s to 40s.
He was urgently sent for cardiac evaluation by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73**].
He requested the patient have a cardiac catheterization for consideration of a pacemaker placement.
The patient had chest pain and a positive stress test showing a moderate sized inferior wall reversible defect and was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who advised cardiac catheterization at that time.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Neck examination revealed no lymphadenopathy.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Lower extremity examination revealed 1+ edema bilaterally.
Groin examination revealed no bruits.
Skin examination revealed no rashes.
Neurologic examination was grossly intact.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2186-9-29**] with stent placement in the right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery.
The catheterization also showed diffuse left circumflex disease.
Status post catheterization, the patient had a vagal episode resulting in his heart rate decreasing to 39 and a systolic blood pressure in the 60s.
Status post cardiac catheterization, the patient was also noted to have an elevation in his creatine kinase levels to values of 1034; however, the MB fraction was low.
A magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography of the patient's head and neck was planned to further evaluate his carotid disease, but this was unable to be obtained secondary to the patient's recent coronary artery stent placement.
He underwent a baseline computed tomography scan of the head which was negative prior to this intervention.
They performed serial examinations before and after his carotid artery stent placement.
Status post carotid artery stent placement, the patient was monitored in the Coronary Care Unit overnight; specifically, to maintain blood pressure values in the 120 to 150 range in case he needed pressor support.
His Losartan dose was decreased to 25 mg by mouth once per day in order to maintain a systolic blood pressure in the 120 to 150 range.
SINUS BRADYCARDIA ISSUES:  Initially, the patient was admitted for evaluation and likely pacemaker placement.
However, the pacemaker evaluation was postponed pending evaluation of the patient's coronary arteries and carotid arteries.
He was to follow up in three weeks with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73**] for further evaluation.
If an interval change does occur, the patient should undergo an outpatient evaluation of the mass including a possible oncologic workup.
