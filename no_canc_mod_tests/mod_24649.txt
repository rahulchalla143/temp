As she had a history of a stroke in [**Month (only) 216**], and had recently been restarted on Coumadin, there was some concern that she may have developed hemorrhagic conversion of her prior stroke, however she had a head CT with no sign of hemorrhage.
She was successfully extubated on [**10-5**], and after extensive discussion with her family it was confirmed that her wishes were to be DNR/DNI.
Later that evening she developed increasing respiratory distress, and a repeat chest x-ray showed near collapse of her left lung, which was suspected to be due to mucous plugging.
The option of a bronchoscopy was discussed with the family, however after extended discussion, it was decided that the patient's wishes at this time would be to not undergo any further aggressive intervention, and she was made CMO.
