The patient has a history of endocarditis in [**2196-1-25**], status post aortic valve replacement and repair of her mitral and tricuspid valves with an echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 55%, and 4+ tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient was home for a period of one month or two after rehabilitation from this surgery when she returned to [**Hospital6 1708**] where she received all of her care for drainage of bilateral groin lymphoceles which were found to be infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus, and corynebacterium.
Today, the patient was noted to have a temperature of 101.
She was sent to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department because [**Hospital6 1708**] was on diversion.
She was noted to be hypotensive with a blood pressure in the 70s in the Emergency Department and received 3 liters of normal saline with an increase in her systolic blood pressure to the 90s.
She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for management of sepsis as well as monitoring for gastrointestinal bleed and was noted to have a heme-positive rectal examination and decreased platelet count in the Emergency Department.
and transfused with a hematocrit of less than 24.
Aortic valve replacement, mitral and tricuspid repair.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed temperature of 103, pulse 110, blood pressure 90/40, respiratory rate 30, pulse oximetry 96% on room air.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities revealed 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count 14.2 (with 75 neutrophils, 15 bands, 7 lymphocytes), hematocrit 29, platelets of 75.
Urinalysis was notable for a large amount of blood, positive nitrites, 30 protein, 236 red blood cells, 22 white blood cells.
Chem-7 notable for a potassium of 2.9, bicarbonate of 28.
ALT 74, alkaline phosphatase 85, total bilirubin 1.4, CK of 7.
PT 15.6, PTT 33.9.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, a right bundle-branch block, left axis deviation, rate 112, T wave inversions in leads II and aVL.
Chest x-ray with pleural effusion on the right with a question of a right infiltrate.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had blood cultures grow 4/4 bottles positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and was treated from the date of admission with vancomycin and gentamicin for one week.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which demonstrated no overt vegetations and was compared with prior transesophageal echocardiogram [**Hospital6 1708**].
Stool culture and urine cultures were all negative as well as surveillance cultures on this patient.
The patient was to follow up with her outpatient physicians at [**Hospital6 8866**] for further workup of infection and endocarditis.
The patient maintained her blood pressure and her oxygen saturations throughout the course of her admission after initial presentation.
Given her good oxygen saturations on room air, the decision was made to not intervene at this point.
