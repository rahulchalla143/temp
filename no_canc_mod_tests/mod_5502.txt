Admission Date:  [**2113-5-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2113-5-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2054-5-1**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old male with chronic renal insufficiency and known coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2101**], status post CABG in [**2105**] [**Hospital1 **], hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and tobacco use, who presented to [**Hospital3 3834**] with substernal chest pain.
He presented to [**Hospital3 3834**], where he was found to have global ST depression, and was given a half of dose, TNK and Aggrastat and Heparin drip, also borderline hypotension, SBP in the 90s-100 which was sensitive to fluid.
On arrival, he was evaluated by CCU and was found to be stable and pain free, and was decided to transfer to unit and in anticipation for catheterization in the am.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission:  Atrial fibrillation, heart rate 88, blood pressure 89/60, and 98% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
OUTPATIENT HOSPITAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cells 12, hematocrit 39.6, platelets 306.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.8, chloride 103, bicarb of 26, BUN 21, creatinine 1.0, glucose of 164, INR of 1.0.
CK of 166, MB 19, MB 111, troponin greater than 25.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  Normal sinus rhythm at 87, normal axis, normal intervals, ST depressions, in I, II, greater than III, aVF, V2-V3, right sided V4, strain.
Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 **]:  Normal sinus rhythm at 91, normal axis and normal intervals, but significant ST depressions in V4 through V6, significantly improved.
Had a bedside echocardiogram which was limited of optimal with no obvious focal wall motion abnormalities through the inferior wall, so the inferior wall may be more hypokinetic, [**2-27**]+ mitral regurgitation, [**1-26**]+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Patient presented to initial CK 114, troponin 0.05 on arrival, to [**Hospital3 **], CK 166, MB 19, troponin greater than 25 but pain free.
Peak CK 571, MB 106, troponin greater than 50, stable and pain free on night of admission.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation revealed severe LMCA and right coronary artery disease.
Graft angiography demonstrated a patent LIMA to mid left anterior descending artery that supplied a small distal vessel and a small diagonal 2 that ran parralel as a "twin left anterior descending artery" system.
The LIMA also supplied a small proximal vessel and a small bifurcating D1 0 via retrograde flow.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal RV filling pressures with a RV mean pressure of 7 mg Hg and RV end diastolic pressure of 11.
The cardiac output was preserved at 5.5.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
On [**2113-5-22**], the patient had an echocardiogram which was pending at the time of discharge.
Left femoral groin showed no evidence of hematoma or bruit.
He had an echocardiogram performed on [**2113-5-22**] which was pending at the time of discharge.
However, it subsequently returned showing ejection fraction of 40%, normal left ventricular wall thickness, and cavity size, regional wall motion abnormalities, including basal inferior akinesis with basal and mid inferolateral mid inferior hypokinesis, right ventricular chamber size, and free wall motion are normal.
Mild systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction of 40%.
