Urinalysis had large amounts of blood.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  Chest x-ray was significant for a question of a widen mediastinum with good position of the ET tube.
Head CT Scan was significant for a large acute subdural hematoma with mass effect and shift to the right, extensive fascial fractures with pneumocephalus.
CT Scan of the C spine showed no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.
CTA of the chest showed no aortic injury, but did show bilateral pulmonary contusion.
CT Scan of the abdomen showed no intraabdominal injuries, or free fluid, or free air.
Left femur film showed fracture of the mid distal third of the femur which was a compound fracture.
Film of the right hand showed a markedly comminuted spiral fracture of the proximal phalanx of the right second finger.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient after resuscitation and evaluation in the Trauma Bay was taken to the Operating Room for emergent craniotomy and evacuation of left epidural hematoma.
An echocardiogram was done, transesophageal echo was done intraoperatively which was normal.
He underwent cerebral angiography on [**1-26**] which demonstrated a left direct carotid cavernous sinus fistula mid direct inferior maxillary artery, superior ophthalmic vein fistula which is coiled.
He subsequently underwent an angiography on [**2-3**] which demonstrated stable cerebrovasculature.
The patient's exam has remained stable, though visual acuity has not been tested secondary to patient's altered mental status, but will be followed as an outpatient.
Patient received an early swallow study which he failed secondary to altered mental status.
The patient will receive a video swallow prior to discharge to determine p.o.
His blood gas at that time was 7.42, 38, 12, 62, 25, 99%.
Chest x-ray showed a small left effusion, but no evidence of pulmonary edema.
