Echocardiogram was done at that time which showed 4+ mitral regurgitation with partial leaflet flail and 1+ AI.
His ejection fraction at that time was 55%.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY WORK:  White count of 6.9, hematocrit of 35.2, platelet count of 196,000.
Sodium 145, potassium 3.5, chloride 106, CO2 28, BUN 24, creatinine 1.1.
Potassium [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] mEq replacement q day; he was unsure of his dose.
PREOPERATIVE CHEST X-RAY:  Mild congestive heart failure with some peribronchial cuffing.
His cardiac catheterization on [**12-27**] showed normal coronary arteries with an ejection fraction of 55% and [**2-22**]+ mitral regurgitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, he was in sinus rhythm with ectopic beats at 60, his blood pressure is 130/80.
His distal peripheral pulses were intact.
His abdominal examination was benign.
His right femoral catheterization site was not completely sealed at the time.
On postoperative day one while he had some ectopy and was A-paced with a blood pressure of 101/45, he started his aspirin.
He was extubated the evening prior with a respiratory rate of 15, sating 98% on 40% face mask, white count of 14.5, hematocrit of 28.
Postoperative laboratories 149 sodium, potassium 4.6, chloride 109, CO2 22, BUN 21, creatinine 0.8, blood sugar of 149.
His diet was advanced, and his chest PT was begun.
On progress notes from the CT Surgery team for [**1-14**], 25th, and 26th, appear to be missing from the chart.
His heart rate was in the 60s down to 50s in the junctional rhythm.
His blood pressure was 130/80 on the morning of the 27th.
His underlying rhythm was sinus bradycardia, and he has come out of his junctional rhythms for very brief periods.
He was in sinus rhythm in the 60s with the time of examination of 142/66, respiratory rate of 18, was sating at 96% on room air.
He was hemodynamically stable with a white count of 8.2, hematocrit of 23.1.
His abdominal examination was benign.
His magnesium was 1.9.
He was started on low dose Lopressor to help control his rate as per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
He was tolerating his Lopressor well at decreased dose, IV Heparin continued, and he remained in atrial fibrillation with blood pressure of 116/70.
His abdominal examination was benign.
His Heparin was to be shut off at 2 am that night for pacemaker placement in the morning.
FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to have followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] Cardiology of Cardiology for his INR and anticoagulation status and Coumadin dosing as well as followup for his arrhythmia and pacemaker placement.
The patient was instructed that Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] would be following his Coumadin dosing and INR blood draws.
