She had a RUQ ultrasound in the ED which demonstrated moderate amount of sludge with few shadowing stones in the gall bladder.
Her blood pressures on [**5-23**] ranged 110-147/53-82, and on [**5-24**] ranged 132-180/73-91.
Cardiac enzymes were checked, and the first set was elevated (troponin 0.11, CK at that time 82).
Second set was elevated as well (T 0.22, CK 103).
The morning of admission, she again triggered for hypotension (80/46), heart rate 56.

An intraluminal oval rounded hypodense structure is seen near the junction of the second and third portions of the duodenum, previously hyperdense on a contrast-enhanced study (and therefore possibly enhancing).
The structure appears quite hyperdense on the prior exam of [**5-22**].
TTE [**5-26**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
A pericardial cyst is not seen on this study.

She presented on [**5-22**] with symptoms of anorexia, vomiting, R-sided abdominal pain, and CT scan and U/S reports concerning for acute cholecystitis.
She had a CT torso to evaluate for source of infection, which showed worsening cholecystitis.
She was intubated and stabilized in the ICU, and was transferred to the floor with all blood cultures from [**5-27**] being negative at time of discharge.
Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] also underwent an echocardiogram to evaluate for endocarditis in the setting of bactermia.
It was decided that she would not be a good candidate for further imaging with trans-esophageal echocardiogram, so she will be treated for a 6-week course of antibiotics for presumed endocarditis based on TTE.
Troponin peaked at .91, CK at 211.
Echo showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, mild aortic and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Given her depressed EF, ACEI was recommended once her BP was able to tolerate an additional antihypertensive.
#) Anuria/acute renal failure: Creatinine peaked at 1.8 in the setting of sepsis/hypovolemia.
Her creatinine improved with fluid resuscitation and treatment of infection to 1.1 at time of discharge.
MRI should be considered for further evaluation if she has hemodynamic decline or develops neurologic deficits.

Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: stable, breathing comfortably on 2L/NC, sleepy but arousable and conversant   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for cholecystitis (infection of the gall bladder), and this was complicated by a blood infection.
4) We discontinued your Lasix because your blood pressure was low.
If you develop worsening shortness of breath, difficlty breathing, low blood pressures with systolic <90, fevers >101 degrees, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention immediately.
