History of Present Illness:  62 y/o male with HTN, HLD, AR and ascending aortic aneurysm s/p resection and AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]) on [**2152-10-2**] with course c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] with recent admission from [**Date range (3) 90691**] for pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p pericardiocentesis followed by pericardial window, believed to be post-surgical, also s/p chest tube for pleural effusion who presented to [**Hospital3 1443**] today for INR check and developed shortness of breath with subsequent syncopal event.
A TTE was performed that by report revealed a medium-sized effusion with RV collapse.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Bedside echo showed small pericardial effusion without clear e/o RA/RV collapse though visualization of the RA and RV was difficult   Past Medical History: 1.

ECHO [**11-29**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR PA/LAT [**11-29**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the retrocardiac lung areas are better ventilated.
TTE [**11-30**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
# Syncope/Recurrent Pericardial Effusion: Mr. [**Known lastname 90690**] was transferred from OSH for concern of pericardial tamponade after he experienced a syncopal event with an echo showing pericardial fluid.
He had an echo which demonstrated a significant amount of pericardial fluid but without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
He also did not have any arrythmias on telemetry but was found to have borderline blood pressures with mild orthostatic symptoms.
Other labs and imaging were unrevealing for a cause of his syncopal event and repeat TTE did not show significant interval progression of his effusion.
Asending Aortic Aneurysm and AR s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]): His admission INR of 2.9 (goal of 2.5-3.5).
Hypertension: He had somewhat borderline blood pressures during this admission but without tamponade.
-Should he continue to have pre-syncopal or syncopal events, he will need another syncopal workup.

While you were there, they did an echocardiogram of your heart and thought that they saw fluid around your heart.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
When you got here, we also did an echocardiogram, and on our study, we did not think that you had a significant amount of fluid around your heart that would account for your shortness of breath.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also have to get your INR checked tomorrow, and send the results to your PCP.
