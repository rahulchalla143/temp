Normal IVC diameter (<2.1cm) with 35-50% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (0-10mmHg).
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
In ED he was noted to have HR in 140s -> EKG showing afib/aflutter and received diltiazem in the ED.
he was then transferred to the Trauma ICU for diltiazem drip, pain control, pulmonary toilet and for close monitoring of his hematocrits given the adrenal hematoma noted on CT imaging.
Because of the dysrhythmia noted he underwent an ECHO which showed a normal EF and no VSD or pericardial effusion.
Postoperatively he was noted with a hematocrit drop; his pre-op HCT was 29.3, postoperatively it was 27 and dropped to 22 without any hemodynamic instability.
It was explained to him at length that he required at least another 1-2 days in the hospital for ongoing monitoring of his hematocrit; for continued work with Physical and Occupational therapy and for optimal pain management.
You have been prescribed a blood thinner called Coumadin; the dose ordered for you is considered a mini dose and with this the blood levels called INR do not need to be monitored unless bleeding problems occur.
Inform the office that you will need an AP chest xray for this appointment.
