GRAM STAIN (Final [**2101-12-10**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2101-12-15**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
HSV PCR ([**12-10**]) - negative .
Discharge Labs: ---------------- WBC-10.7, Hct-38, Plt-294 Na-139, K-4.3, Cl-101, HCO3-28, BUN-13, Cr-1.1, Gluc-84, Ca-9.7, Mg-2.2, Phos-3.4 .
Studies: --------- ECG ([**12-13**]): Sinus rhythm.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2101-12-11**] 4:54 AM The tip of the ET tube is in satisfactory position approximately 4.7 cm above the carina.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2101-12-11**] 2:15 PM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction.
Bilateral T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities are grossly stable since [**2094-4-12**] and likely represent chronic small vessel ischemia.
EEG ([**12-11**]): FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: In the most awake-appearing portions of this tracing, a moderately well-organized 7-7.5 Hz theta frequency background was seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Revealed a generally regular rhythm with average rate of 66 bpm.
Head CT ([**12-10**]): CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2101-12-9**] 9:56 PM NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Again, MRI with DWI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2101-12-8**] 6:36 PM FINDINGS: The study is motion degraded.
Please note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for the detection of acute infarction.
CT head showed no acute changes.
He had an MRI with no acute change (results as above).
An LP was done with results as above.
Hct was as low as 28, however patient received significant IV fluid for decreased bp.
His hct was 38 on discharge.
Hematocrit recheck is recommended in 10 days to ensure stability.
Htn - bp decreased while patient in the ICU.
BP should be monitored as an outpatient, and consideration should be given to restarting this as an outpatient.
Mr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 565**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10743**] stated that in event of a cardiac and respiratory arrest - he did want manual chest compressions but no shocks, mechanical ventilation, intubation or other artificial means of resuscitation.
Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14936**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] as well.
The patient will need formal capacity testing to determine if he can understand and make his own decisions about medical care and code status.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] health care center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Altered mental status - likely secondary to serotonin syndrome Hypothermia - resolved Secondary: Acute renal failure - in setting of Acyclovir, resolved GI bleed Depression/Anxiety Dyslipidemia Crohn's Disease BPH s/p TURP Mental Retardation   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted due to hypothermia.
Since your spinal fluid test for HSV was negative, this medication was stopped.
These can be restarted if your primary doctor rechecks your liver tests and finds them to be back to your baseline and your blood pressure is elevated.
