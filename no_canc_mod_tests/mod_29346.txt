The heart size, and mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Initially when she arrived to the floor she was afebrile, normotensive without signs of orthostasis, had a negative UA, a clear chest xray and no signs/symptoms of a fever.
Urine cultures returned with 10-100,000 organisms coag negative staph.
Blood cultures remained negative.
Vital signs stabilized and she was transfered back to the medical floor after 2 days in the ICU.
Stress dose steroids were planned for a 7 day course, antibiotics were peeled back to levofloxacin alone, and a R hip film revealed no loosening nor inflammation.
Echo showed normal function, trace AR, and no MR.  She had a normal RUQ US, as well.
At the time of discharge, her potassium had been low despite repletion, Na was elevated, as was blood pressure.
Neuro exam was normal.
She still had no localizing signs of infection and culture data was negative to be negative.
She had cultures drawn, was given tylenol (tylenol screen prior to this dose was negative, as was a urine tox), was started on levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin to cover emperically for hospital aquired pneumonia, GI sources, and a potential hip infection.
In the ICU she also received an echo that revealed normal function and little valvular disease (she has two loud systolic murmurs on exam), and a hip film revealing no inflammation nor loosening.
Urine culture twice grew 10-100,000 coag negative staph.
Hepatitis serologies were negative and the pt was eventually felt to have had shock liver from her hypotensive episode as the transaminitis resolved over time.
calcium levels were followed with a goal to keep them around 8.0 by continuing Calcium carbonate, calcitriol.
Per endocrine at the time of discharge, the pt may need an increase in calcium PO, but at this time they recommended no change.
At the time of discharge, her potassium had been low despite repletion, Na was elevated, as was blood pressure.
A R hip film was negative for pathology or failure of her hip replacement.
