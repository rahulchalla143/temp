CT at that time showed a tiny focus of low attenuation in the right frontal lobe in the subcortical area.
An LP showed protein of 237, glucose 14, 100 nucleated cells in the CSF only 1 of which was a PMN.
CSF studies for HSV 1 and 2 pending.
Pupils [**4-6**] on the right and 6-4on left, with left being somewhat sluggish.
No observed myoclonus or tremor No pronator drift  Could not cooperate with complete motor exam and had giveway weakness many times on exam.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout.
Gait: not assessed  Labs: pending   Pertinent Results: MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-6-4**] 11:16 PM  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  Reason: right frontal hypodensity?
COMPARISON: CT of the head done on [**2118-6-4**].
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast.
On the axial FLAIR sequence, there is increased signal noted in the cerebral sulci, diffusely, as well as in the basal cisterns with some enhancement on the post-contrast images, in addition to the enhancement of the venous structures within the sulci.
The previously described hypodensity on the CT scan, represents a small perivascular space, suppressed on the FLAIR sequence (series 7, image 11).
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2118-6-6**] 6:05 PM FINDINGS: Large parts of the left upper lobe, notably the apical and the posterior segment, are occupied by a widespread parenchymal pathology.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-6-9**] 9:09 AM  FINDINGS: There is interval new, moderate ventriculomegaly, involving all the ventricles, with few areas of periventricular hypodensities, most prominent around the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] (series 3, image 9).
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-6-11**] and [**2118-6-14**] showed no interval changes when compared to the study on [**2118-6-9**].
CT HEAD- [**2118-6-22**]- In comparison with the prior study, there is evidence of mild improvement in the ventricular size, with less effacement of the sulci as described in detail above.
([**2118-6-8**]) Bronchoaveolar Lavage - Smear positive for acid fast bacilli.
HIV-1 Antibody test was negative.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1794**] is a 20 year old woman from [**Country 4194**] who was here in [**Location (un) 86**] studying English and presented with subacute onset of headache and later neck pain, transferred to the neurology service at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 15286**] following CSF profile revealed protein of 237, glucose 14, 100 nucleated cells, 1 of which was a PMN, in the setting of mental status changes.
Repeat LP revealed total protein 183, Glucose 22, WBC 160, RBC 40, 73% Lymphocytes.
Left upper lobe infiltrate on CXR was further evaluated by chest CT, then BAL returned AFB positive smear and positive for TB with amplified MTD test.
T/L-spine MR [**First Name (Titles) 3780**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e leptomeningeal enhancement of the entire cord and cauda equina c/w arachnoiditis.
A head CT on [**2118-6-9**] [**Date Range 3780**] global ventriculomegaly with a questionable focus of hypointensity in the left temporal lobe that could represent ependymal CSF flow vs parenchymal disease; later repeat head CT revealed resolution of this abnormality.
Routine LFTs and pancreatic enzymes showed a transient elevation of amylase and lipase to the low 100s.
On [**6-13**] a CT abdomen/pelvis was unremarkable.
Serial LFT's and amylase, lipase measurements were stable.
She will follow up for urodynamics testing as an outpatient, pending results of the study she will need to be seen by the urology resident clinic for further care.
Her color testing while on ethambutol was normal.
She will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital 78679**] clinic as an outpatient for follow up in the next 2-3 weeks for repeat color vision testing, visual fields and full ophthalmologic exam while on antiTB treatment.
She will require regular surveillance by infectious disease, neurologists and urologists once she returns to [**Country 4194**] for safety labs while on INH, Rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, as well as for treatment of long term sequelae of her infection.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
