The patient was found down after 8-10 minutes in asystole and was administered epi/atropine x4 by EMS with return of pulse and blood pressure.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her vitals were HR 50s-80s, BP 90s-160/50s-60she was found to have pupils 5mm NR, unresponsive without sedation, and EKG with lateral deep ST depressions.
CT of the head revealed no ICH or mass effect.
The patient was found to have a K of 6.2 and was treated with 1 amp of Na HCO3, 1 amp Ca gluconate, 10 U of insulin with D50, kayexalate 30 gm x1.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2163**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D1 and PDCA), last cath [**3-/2164**] with elev R and L filling pressures, PTCA of RCA and 2 VD; last ETT-MIBI [**6-21**] 6 min on [**Doctor Last Name 4001**] protocol, no reversible defects.
CHF with EF 45-50% on last echo [**10-20**], mild LV systolic dysfunction, mildly depressed LV function, inf and mid inf HK, mild 1+MR.
Anemia - unclear etiology; baseline Hct 29-31, last iron studies nl [**7-21**]; per pt, has never had EGD or colonoscopy   Social History: SH: lives with her boyfriend at home, retired; previous tob user 2ppdx20 yrs, quit [**2155**]; no ETOH   Family History: FH: sig for father who deceased in his 50s from cirrhosis secondary to alcoholism; 1 brother deceased from MI in his 40s; other brother who died of lymphoma in his 50s  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.2 P 86 BP 122-163/55-65 R [**10-9**] Sat 99% on AC 500x22, PEEP 5, FiO2 60%, PIP 36 UO: minimal ABG: 7.21/50/21 on current settings Gen: obese caucasian female laying in bed at 30 degrees, unresponsive HEENT: pupils fixed and dilated at 5-6 mm, conjunctivae injected, OG and ET tube in place Neck: obese CV: RRR, no m/r/g Lungs: coarse breath sounds diffusely Ab: soft, protuberant Extrem: trace pitting pretibial edema BL LE, full dp/pt and radial pulses Skin: no rashes or ulcers Neuro: comatose, GCS score of 3, no pupillary/oculcephalic reflex, negative doll's eye, no knee or biceps reflexes, toes mute   Pertinent Results: Echocardiogram on [**2177-2-5**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is [**3-27**]  mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of  [**2175-6-30**], right ventricular cavity enlargement and regional dysfunction is  now identified and left ventricular systolic function now appears normal.
If clinically indicated, a cardiac MRI ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9559**]) may be able to clarify RV pathology.
Head CT on [**2177-2-5**]: HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is no comparison.
#Asystolic Cardiac Arrest: The precipitant of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but likely related to an MI.
Serum tox was negative, and BP is stable off pressors so a massive PE or tamponade is unlikely as well.
She also appears to have an ?epidural hematoma vs. artifact on CT of the C spine, for which its contribution to her presentation is unclear.
EEG ordered to eval for brain activity.
Neuroimaging findings are also useful adjuncts, however, and CT yesterday already demonstrated loss of grey-white differentiation throughout.
The neurologic examination three days after the event has been demonstrated to be a reliable indicator of prognosis, however the literature supports the notion that patients with absent brainstem reflexes at any time after the event have relatively poor prognosis with low likelihood of returning to a high functional status. "
PCO2 was 72 with pH of 7.11 and bicarb of 22 indicating a primary respiratory acidosis.
Her troponin is also elevated in the setting of renal failure.
EKG on admission revealed lateral ST depressions.
The patient's renal insufficiency is unlikely to account for the hyperkalemia as her creatinine is not far from baseline.
# DM: The patient has known DM with glucose levels in the 300s-400s.
