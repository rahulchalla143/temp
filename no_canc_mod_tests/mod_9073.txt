Presented to [**Hospital1 2436**] ER this AM and vitals were stable with HR 70-80, BP 109-140/60-80's, sat 98% 2 L NC.
His cardiac enzymes were elevated (Trop 0.41 and myloglobin 274 -they do not do CPK).
- LAD: 50% ostial, 2 other serial lesions at mLAD (70% each)  and large D1 80%  - LCX: 70% ostial.
OM1 70% and 2 more LCX lesions: one 70% at ostium of OM1 and 2nd lesion 70% post OM1 takeoff.
- EF 35-40% with Akinetic apex on LV gram.
Physical Exam: Blood pressure was 118/69 mm Hg while seated.
Pulse was 82 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min.
Tmax was 98.4 Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and well groomed.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds or rubs.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th intercostal space, mid clavicular line.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Limited resting hemodynamic measurement reveals normal central aortic pressure with mildly elevated LV filling pressure (LVEDP 15mmHg).
The anterior lateral wall was akinetic and the apex were hypokinetic.
[**2137-1-9**] ECHO The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)  Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.2 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% to 35% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Ascending: 3.0 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aortic Valve - LVOT Diam: 2.2 cm  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex - hypo; apex - hypo; remaining LV segments contract normally.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
A cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed severe three vessel disease.
Mr. [**Known lastname 48425**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed no significant internal carotid artery stenosis.
He was then transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
