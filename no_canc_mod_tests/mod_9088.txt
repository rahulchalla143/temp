Marked ventricular and sulcal prominence is increased from prior study and is related to global atrophy.
Air-fluid levels and aerosolized secretions noted within the sphenoid sinus as well as partial opacification of the ethmoid air cells.
Acute sinus disease  CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2137-4-15**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiothoracic process.
Head CT was negative for acute hemorrheagic stroke, TSH and B12 were normal.
# Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state/Diabetes mellitus type 2, uncontrolled, with complications: Patient had altered mental status, elevated seurm osms, and serum glucose with anion gap acidosis.
Though urine was positive for ketones patient has had very poor oral intake x 3 days and decreased po intake x 1 month, ketonuria is related to starvation ketosis rather than DKA.
Her acidosis improved, anion gap closed and she was taken off of the insulin drip and changed to insulin sliding scale.
Culture data from [**Hospital3 **] revealed proteus sensitive to ceftriaxone.
On admission, sodium corrected for glucose is 168.
She was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation as above and serum sodium trended down.
Creatinine trended down to 1.0 with fluids.
Patient appeared hypovolemic on exam on admission and was euvolemic on discharge.
Discharge Instructions:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was admitted for increasing confusion and was found to have high sodium levels in her blood and a urinary tract infection.
