MICROBIOLOGY DATA:  Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending.
The ABG revealed pH of 7.22, carbon dioxide 33, oxygen 364 with a bicarbonate 14.
The patient was given aggressive volume resuscitation and pressors to maintain blood pressure with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] greater than 60.
The patient's renal function will be followed as will her urine output as it appears that the patient is in acute tubular necrosis.
A DIC panel was checked on admission as the patient had elevated coagulation panel.
Cultures of the tampon came back positive for Staphylococcus aureus, which was Penicillin resistant, but methicillin sensitive.
The Clindamycin, Oxacillin, Ceftriaxone and activated protein C were continued and stool was sent for C-difficile analysis.
The patient maintained good urine output and the creatinine started to come down.
On hospital day #9 the patient was eating well and her saturation was maintained on minimal oxygen.
The saturation was 87% on room air and 97% on three liters.
The hematocrit is stable at 25 and the patient will not be transfused until the hematocrit drops below 22.
The patient's creatinine continued to drop.
MRI of the cervical spine was obtained to rule out any central pathology.
The results of the toxic shock syndrome toxin and antibody test returned on Thursday, [**1-10**], or Friday, [**1-11**].
