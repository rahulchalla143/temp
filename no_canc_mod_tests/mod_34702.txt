While at clinic on the day of admission, an EKG was performed which showed wide-complex ventricular tachycardia at 110 bpm and he was found to be hypotensive; patient was asymptomatic at the time.
In the ED, initial vitals were temperature of 97.2, heart rate of 131, blood pressure of 89/64, respiratory rate of 18 and oxygen saturation of 93% on 2L.
He received 500 mg NS bolus in Nashoha ED before transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED and his blood pressure improved to 93/58.
The EKG at clinic showed wide QRS complex ventricular tachycardia at 110 bpm which is different from prior EKG.
All of the other review of systems were negative except those mentioned in HPI.

Since the previous tracing of [**2122-11-5**] intraventricular conduction delay appears slightly less prominent and QRS voltage more prominent.
Since the previous tracing of same date ventricular tachycardia is now present.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-11-7**], the findings are similar.
The LV systolic function was probably overestimated on the prior study.
CXR: [**2122-11-25**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-10**], the left lung is now substantially clear.
[**2122-11-27**]: Comparison is made with prior study [**11-25**].
Intermittent slow ventricular tachycardia - Patient was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for further management of ventricular tachycardia.
On arrival, telemetry showed that he was flipping into ventricular tachycardia with HR in the 110s to 130s out of sinus heart rate of 50s and 60s while remaining asymptomatic.
Pt remained totally asymptomatic during his stay in the CCU and he was transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for further management.
By discharge, pt had increased PO intake and urine output improved subsequently.
Coronary artery disease s/p CABG/AVR, Systolic CHF with EF - During this admission, pt ruled out for an MI with cardiac enzymes negative x2.
A transthoracic ECHO performed on [**2122-11-26**] showed a dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction and a depressed cardiac index; it also showed a normally-functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis with mild paravalvular leak.
Hypertension - Patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled on this admission.
Chronic Systolic Heart Failure - Patient was dry on exam and continued to have relatively limited PO intake.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**1-16**] Sprays Nasal Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for nasal dryness.
Secondary: Syncopal episodes secondary to dehydration Coronary artery disease s/p CABG/AVR Systolic congestive heart failure with EF of 20%   Discharge Condition: Discharged in good condition; patient oriented to person, place and time.
Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
MEDICATION CHANGES: - Please take amiodarone 400 mg twice daily for 1 week, the 200 mg twice daily until you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**].
