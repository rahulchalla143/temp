At [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she was noted to have ST elevations in inferior leads with a troponin of 0.55.
There, she received ASA 325 x1, Plavix 600, atorvstatin 80 x 1, ativan 1 mg, integrilin, SL NTG x2, IV lopressor 5 mg * 3, heparin bolus + drip.
Family History: Denies CAD hx  Physical Exam: VS- 97.0, 122/51, 84, 18, 99% RA HEENT- Normocephalic.
LUNGS- clear to auscultation bilaterally.
2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
Non tender to palpation and non-pulsatile.
Pertinent Results: labs on admission: significant for HCT 29.1 ekg- - [**10-21**] 22:43 - NSR 80, nl axis, nl intervals, no LVH/LAE, 1 mm STE in V2/V3, T wave inversion 3/F; no clear anatomic distribution of ischemia.
Cardiac enzymes: CK peak 472, trending down following cath CK MB peak 69 Troponin peak 1.29 .
Cardiac catheterization ([**10-21**]): 1.
Femoral ultrasound ([**10-22**]): Hematoma.
CXR ([**10-22**]): 1.
Evaluation with a dedicated PA and lateral view is recommended.
ECHO ([**10-22**]): 1.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Labs at discharge: WBC 6.4, Hgb 12.1, Hct 34.6 (stable), Platelets 147,000 BMP unremarkable Cholesterol 162, TG 94, HDL 45, LDL 98  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 78 year old female with inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction now status post catheterization complicated by a large right groin hematoma.
Her hematocrit at discharge was stable, though she did require three units of blood immediately following her catheterization due to falling hematocrit at that time.
Her lipids are near goal with LDL 98.
- Her echocardiogram does demonstrate a hyperdynamic ejection fraction.
She will have labs drawn on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**10-28**], to assess her electrolytes and renal function.
There was no evidence of pseudoaneurysm on physical exam or on ultrasound performed on [**10-22**].
Her hematocrit was stable on day of discharge, and the patient's movement was not impeded in any way.
She had her electrolytes repleted as necesssary.
#) Communication - The patient's son is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1007**] H [**Telephone/Fax (1) 68866**], C [**Telephone/Fax (1) 68867**].
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST elevation myocardial infarction, status post catheterization with stent placed in the right coronary artery   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, with stable red blood cell count, and comfortable on room air   Discharge Instructions: Please take all your medications as prescribed.
