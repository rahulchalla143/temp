At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were: 98.8 95 151/83 18 98% 2L Nasal Cannula.
Initial labs demonstrated troponin < 0.01, baseline cbc and unremarkable chem10.
A CT scan demosntrated no intracranial injury and mild age inappropriate prominenence of the sulci which appeared stable compared to prior imaging.
A serum and urine tox screens were added on to his prior samples and were notable for a positive urine cocaine and negative for etoh.
Given absence of findings on CT scan, his presenting seizure was felt to represent an induced event rather than primary epilepsy.
Menigitis/encephalitis was considered, however given the absence of infectious signs and absence of fever, a lumbar puncture was not immediately recommended or pursued.
Vitals on transfer were: Meningitis/Encephalitis, given the lack of infectious signs/symptoms, is very unlikely in this case but there would be a low threshold for LP and empiric meningitis coverage if he were to develop fever.
