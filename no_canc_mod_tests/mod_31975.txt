GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 10 mmHg).
