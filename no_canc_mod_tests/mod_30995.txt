The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a temperature of 96.2.
Heart rate 81.
Blood pressure 110/60.
Respiratory rate 12 and oxygen saturation 87% on a 100% nonrebreather mask.
Head and neck exam revealed moist mucous membranes, anicteric sclera and no elevated jugular venous distention.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities had no edema with 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Neurological exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY STUDIES:  Significant for a white blood cell count of 20.0, hematocrit 41.6 and platelet count of 273,000.
Coagulation studies were within normal limits.
Panel 7 significant for a potassium of 3.8, BUN of 16, and creatinine of 0.9.
Magnesium was 1.6.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute with right axis deviation, Q waves in leads V5 and V6, poor R wave progression with ST depressions in leads V1 through V3.
Left heart catheterization demonstrated the following: Left main coronary artery was normal, left anterior descending had a less than 50% proximal lesion, left circumflex had a 70% ostial lesion and totally occluded lesion distally at OM1.
Right heart catheterization demonstrated a mean RA pressure of 20, PA pressures of 52/30, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 40, and a cardiac output of 3.21 and an index of 1.76.
The peak creatinine kinase level was 7,535 with MB fraction of 730.
The patient had persistent chest discomfort without ECG changes following catheterization attributed to post- infarction pericarditis, and a transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no pericardial effusion with an ejection fraction of 25 to 30%.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated ST depressions in leads V3 and V4 which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
Later that evening, the patient experienced recurrent chest pain while at rest in bed and again his electrocardiogram had [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in V3 and V4.
Electrocardiogram changes and chest pain resolved with heparin, Integrilin, and nitroglycerin drip.
The patient had a persistent tachycardia with heart rate ranging 90-100 and hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s and 90s.
The patient should measure his blood pressure prior to taking the carvedilol every morning and hold for systolic blood pressure less than 85.
