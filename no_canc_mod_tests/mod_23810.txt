At the OSH, she was imaged with a CT spine, CT chest, and CT pelvis.
Pelvic imaging revealed a left femoral neck fracture, non-displaced.
CT chest revealed a moderately sized left sided and small right sided pleural effusions.
EKG demonstrated T-wave inversions in inferior leads; a single set of cardiac enzymes were negative.
She was weaned to 4 L NC with O2 sats between 97-100, with HRs in the 80s, BPs 120s, and was afebrile.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: The study was conducted in collaboration with speech pathology.
B. CXR ([**2190-10-12**]) HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with respiratory difficulty and altered mental status.
C. MRI Brain ([**2190-10-11**]) EXAM: MRI of the brain.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of CVA with left non-displaced femoral head fracture, has hypoxia and right-sided pleural effusion, for further evaluation to exclude intracranial abnormality.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2, susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired.
FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
E. Head CT INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female status post fall.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain without IV contrast at [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital.
F. CT Abdomen INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female status post fall.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after administration of 130 mL IV Optiray contrast.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Large right and moderate left pleural effusions with associated atelectasis demonstrate simple fluid attenuation, and are better evaluated on chest CT performed at the outside hospital earlier the same day.
The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and right adrenal gland are normal.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter.
Bilateral pleural effusions, better evaluated on CT chest performed earlier the same day at an outside hospital.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-10-7**] rapid atrial fibrillation is new.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 113 0 114 348/440 0 57 -80    Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with baseline dementia, prior CVA x 2, seizure disorder with left femoral neck fracture status post pinning from mechanical fall on [**2190-10-8**] with course complicated by hypoxia from pleural effusions and delirium from possible UTI and metabolic etiologies.
She should have an ECHO as an outpt to assess EF as she has no known history of heart failure.
Her outpt regimen of atenolol 100 [**Hospital1 **] changed to metoprolol 62.5 [**Hospital1 **].
Given INR became subtherapeutic she was started on a lovenox bridge which can be stopped when INR between [**2-3**] for 2 consec days.
Given her h/o prior stroke she had brain MRI that indicated prior stroke BUT no acute infarct with non-focal.
2. enoxaparin 40 mg/0.4 mL Syringe Sig: Forty (40) mg Subcutaneous Q 12H (Every 12 Hours): Continue until INR [**2-3**] for two consecutive days and then discontinue.
11. warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: please monitor INR closely.
