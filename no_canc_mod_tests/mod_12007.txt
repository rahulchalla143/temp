His BP occasionally dropes to SBP of 80s which improved to 110s with 500cc of NS.
ROS was negative for fever, chills, abdominal pain, recent BRBPR, melena, dysuria, hematuri.

ECHO [**2176-10-5**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to akinesis of the basal septum and hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2176-10-7**]: 1.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed diffuse calcified coronary artery disease.
The LAD had widely patent stents, and total occlusion of a moderate sized diagonal seen on prior catheterization from [**2173-11-11**].
Resting hemodynamics revealed moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with mean gradient of 18 mmHg and estimated aortic valve area of 1.0 cm2.
There were elevated left and right-sided filling pressures with mean RA pressure of 15, mean PCWP of 35 mmHg, and LVEDP of 29 mmHg.
Cardiac output was mildly depressed at 4.0 L/min.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2176-10-7**]: 1.
Slight interval increase from the ultrasound of [**2173-10-24**].

PT     PTT  INR(PT) 14.4* 28.6   1.2*  Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old gentleman with coronary artery disease with PCI in [**2174**], hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, presented with rest angina in the setting of rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled with peak trop at 0.92, MB 34, CK 313.
Diagnostic left heart cath showed patent coronaries with prior stents in place, no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
HbA1c and lipid panel as above, all normal.
Electrophysiology study/intervention deferred in setting of highly calcific aorta and moderate aortic stenosis.
INR 1.2 on discharge, will recheck INR in three days.
Cath in [**2173**] with aortic valve area of 1.07 with gradient of 21 mmHg.
# Abdominal aortic aneurysm:  Abdominal ultrasound showed AAA measuring 4.1 cm at the widest diameter, slight interval increase from the ultrasound of [**2173-10-24**].
#  ARF:  Creatinine 1.3 on admission.
Last Creatinine in our system is 0.9 in [**2173**].
Renal function improved over course of stay, 0.9 on discharge.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on Monday [**10-14**] and call results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 719**].
You also had a cardiac catheterization that showed extensive blockages in your coronary artery.
Restart your coumadin at 2 mg, you will need to check your INR on Monday [**10-14**].
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
