He was found to have nonobstructive jaundice with a total serum bilirubin of 18.
A transjugular liver biopsy was attempted at the outside hospital, but the procedure was aborted when the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation.
He was initiated on high dosed steroids (prednisone 60 mg po q day) with subsequent reduction in his total serum bilirubin from 18 to 11.
He also failed to followup with the Liver Clinic at the outside hospital at which time a liver biopsy had been scheduled to be performed.
On initial physical examination at representation to the outside hospital, her had tender hepatomegaly palpable at least 2 cm below the costal margin.
He was also found to have markedly elevated LFTs with an AST of 1586, ALT 927, total bilirubin greater than 45, direct bilirubin greater than 15, alkaline phosphatase 96, GGT 158, and then INR of 2.25.
A urinalysis demonstrated 3+ bilirubin and 3+ blood.
A transjugular biopsy was performed on [**2135-3-18**]; the results demonstrated an acute hepatitis consistent with a drug hypersensitivity reaction, although autoimmune hepatitis could not be excluded.
An abdominal ultrasound done on the same day demonstrated a contracted gallbladder, but no evidence for acute cholecystitis or biliary obstruction.
Given his coagulopathy, the patient was administered fresh-frozen plasma and vitamin K with a subsequent decrease in his INR to 1.55.
This study demonstrated red blood in the upper and middle thirds of the esophagus, presumably from the oropharynx.
This study demonstrated a normal stomach and duodenum; no clear source of bleeding was identified.
A colonoscopy was reportedly deferred due to persistent melena.
Also at the time of these bleeding episodes, the patient developed acute renal failure with an increase in his creatinine from 1.0 to 3.3; he also had decreased urine output at this time.
Urine microscopy demonstrated muddy brown casts consistent with ATN versus bile acid induced injury.
Serial LFTs done at this time demonstrated improvement of his elevated serum immunotransferase levels while on the steroids, but his total serum bilirubin had risen to a level of 73.5.
With this medical picture, the patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2135-3-20**] in order to recent an evaluation for a possible liver transplant.
Also of note, his evaluation at the outside hospital prior to transfer included the following:  A slightly elevated alpha-1 antitrypsin level of 212, normal ceruloplasmin level, LKM negative, SMA 1:40, [**Doctor First Name **] was positive at 1:320, hepatitis A IgG was positive, but IgM was negative.
Hepatitis B virus panel was negative, hepatitis C virus panel was negative, CMV IgG was positive, but IgM was negative.
Coombs test was positive, and the serum haptoglobin was less than 0.6.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, the patient's temperature was 97.8, heart rate 97, blood pressure 146/67, respiratory rate 29, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
He had 2+ dorsalis pedal pulses bilaterally, and there was no peripheral edema.
LABORATORIES:  Initial laboratory evaluation at [**Hospital1 346**] demonstrated a white count of 22.3 (80.9% neutrophils, 28.8% lymphocytes, and 5.5% monocytes), hematocrit 27.6, platelets of 126,000.
Serum chemistries demonstrated a sodium of 138, potassium 3.8, chloride 103, bicarbonate 18, BUN 107, creatinine 6.8, glucose of 121, calcium 8.8, magnesium 2.6, and phosphate of 5.9.
His initial total serum bilirubin was 83.5.
By hospital day two, his total serum bilirubin was 79, with a direct bilirubin of 72.
His ALT was 301, AST 133, LDH 1,098, amylase 203, uric acid 9.9, PT 24.7, PTT 66.9, INR 4.0, fibrinogen 293, albumin 3.4, and haptoglobin was less than 20.
Initial arterial blood gas demonstrated a pH of 7.32, pCO2 of 33, and pO2 of 108.
Gastrointestinal:  As noted above, the liver biopsy done at the outside hospital was more consistent with a drug hypersensitivity reaction than with autoimmune hepatitis.
As noted above, the patient's liver function tests were markedly elevated on admission.
Throughout the first week of his hospitalization, these liver function tests remained markedly elevated.
As the result of the severity of his hepatitis, the patient was initially placed on the list for a liver transplant.
In addition, by hospital day three, the patient's amylase and lipase levels were found to be markedly elevated at 366 and 1,005 respectively.
Following this, the patient's liver function tests slowly trended down throughout the remainder of his hospital course.
By the time of his discharge from the hospital, the slow, progressive decline of his liver function tests had plateaued and his LFTs were stably elevated.
It transiently increased again following the administration of intravenous contrast dye prior to an abdominal CT scan that was done on [**3-29**].
He received hypertonic saline for one day with an increase in his serum sodium.
His intravenous fluids were then adjusted as necessary based upon his serum sodium and serum bicarbonate levels throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
Once aggressive intravenous fluid volume resuscitation was reinstituted, the patient's serum creatinine began to steadily improve.
This workup was negative for toxoplasmosis, HSV-2, syphilis, stool ova and parasites, HIV, EBV, hepadena virus, and herpes virus.
On [**3-23**], a blood culture that was drawn on [**3-21**] began growing a gram-positive cocci and the patient was empirically started on Vancomycin.
Following this course of Vancomycin, the patient's white blood cell count began to steadily increase, it reached a peak of 38,000 on [**3-28**].
Despite the fact that the patient did not have a positive Clostridium difficile toxin antibody, given his markedly elevated white blood cell count in concert with his diarrhea, the clinical diagnosis of Clostridium difficile colitis was made.
Following the initiation of this medication, the patient's white blood cell count decreased dramatically.
By the day of discharge, his white cell count was 11,700, which was the lowest it had been at any point during this hospitalization.
By the time of his discharge, the patient was afebrile and had no clear foci of infection on examination.
On the day of discharge, the patient's INR had decreased to a level of 1.5.
Due to his hyperdynamic precordium, however, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on [**3-31**] to evaluate for the possibility of pulmonary hypertension.
This study did not demonstrate any evidence of pulmonary hypertension, and the patient's ejection fraction was found to be normal.
