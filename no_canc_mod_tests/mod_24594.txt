A bedside echo showed no large effusions.
A stroke code was called, but a Neurology evaluation was negative for deficits and head CT was negative for acute intracranial process.
Her blood pressure improved with crystalloids, she remained afebrile, her white count remained normal, and her hypotension was attributed to volume loss from diarrhea and possibly the toxic effects from clostridium difficile.
EKG changes: On admission, she was noted to have ST depressions in leads V4, V5, and V6, and her BNP was elevated to greater than 24,000.
As her blood pressure improved, her home dose of labetalol was added on hospital day 3.
On recommendation from Renal, amlodipine and clonidine were not restarted, and she was instructed to follow up with her primary physician and dialysis team to restart these medications in the next few days to goal blood pressure <130/80.
You were found to have very low blood pressure and were given intravenous fluids and medications to help raise your blood pressure in the emergency department.
Since your blood pressure remained low, you were transferred to the ICU, where you continued to receive fluids and antibiotics.
Your diarrhea improved with oral vancomycin, and tests confirmed that you have a clostridium difficile infection causing your diarrhea.
Your blood pressure increased and you were restarted on your home dose of labetalol.
Your blood pressures are somewhat elevated now, and you will need to adjust these medications with your primary physician.
You can restart them as needed, but should be careful to ensure that your blood pressure does not drop too low.
