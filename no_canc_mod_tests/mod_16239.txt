In the ED, initial vitals were: T 99.8, HR 120, BP 88/48.
He became hypotensive in the ED with pressures: He received 1 L NS and his pressures came up to the 110s/70s.
His PCP called the [**Name9 (PRE) **] to speak with the staff and per the ED resident did not want central access to be implemented unless the patient could not maintain blood pressures with IVF through the PIV.
Since his pressure came up with only 1 liter of NS, central access was not implemented.
Head CT was done for acute ms changes and was negative for intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarction.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's initial vs were T 99, BP 147/86, R 27, O2at 99% on 100% NRB.

[**2188-11-17**]: CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
IMPRESSION: 1) New bilateral lower lung opacities likely represent multifocal consolidation, including aspiration pneumonitis.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2186-2-7**] atrial fibrillation with continuous ventricular pacing at rate 60 was previously present.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-19**]:  Nasogastric tube ends in the distal stomach.
Diameter of the right colon is difficult to measure since the cecum may not be included in the examination but is probably between 9 and 10 mm across.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are extensive multifocal, ill-defined opacities present at the lung bases.
A smaller laterally located low- attenuation lesion measuring approximately 9 mm likely represents a simple renal cyst but is poorly characterized on this evaluation (2:31).
Once again, the colon is noted to be markedly distended and several air-fluid levels are seen throughout the abdomen and pelvis.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A rectal tube appears to be kinked at the its apex within the rectum.
Findings again suggest functional pseudo-obstruction and are similar to the CT evaluation of [**2188-7-30**] with overall decreased colonic distension.
XR abdomen: FINDINGS: Please note overall examination is limited due to marked respiratory motion artifact.
CT scan obtained same day with results as above (c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3696**]).
Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium was intermittently elevated to as high as 153.
A sodium level is recommended on [**2188-12-4**] and should be followed by PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 5351**].
INR was elevated, so coumadin was initially held.
This was subsequently restarted once his INR began drifting down.
INR recheck recommended on [**2188-12-4**] and resulst to be sent to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5351**] 9PCP) for follow up and dose adjustment.
INR was 1.9 on [**2188-12-1**].
Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: ECHO done during the hospital stay and the results are not available at this time due to system error issues.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Thirty (30) ML PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation: hold if patient having at least [**2-23**] bowel movements/day.
You will need blood work done on [**2188-12-4**] for INR check and sodium level check.
