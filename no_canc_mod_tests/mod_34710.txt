He was seen by Cardiology and Pulmonology consults, and repeat TTE showed an LVEF of 20-25% with global LV hypokinesis and chamber dilatation, and the possibility of an apical thrombus could not be ruled out.
He was started on weight-based heparin gtt and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiac Cath Lab for catheterization.
Catheterization here showed diffuse 20-30% stenosis with mid-vessel 80% stenosis of the LAD and mild luminal irregularities with mid-vessel 60% eccentric stenosis of the LCx.
On arrival to the CCU: VS - Temp 97.6F, BP 125/93, HR 94, R 22, SaO2 97% 2L NC.
Past Medical History: - severe COPD / bronchial asthma - cardiomyopathy w/ EF 30-35%, cause unknown - suspected TIA - h/o recent pneumonia - LBBB on ECG - nephrolithiasis - s/p cataract surgery - s/p hernia repair   Social History: Lives with his wife, fairly independent until symptomatic w/ SOB.
Physical Exam: VS: T = 97.6 F, BP = 125/93, HR = 94, RR = 22, O2 sat = 97% 2L NC GENERAL: WA middle-aged man in NAD.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 10cm.

ECG ([**2131-12-24**]): Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats and possible first beat being a ventricular premature beat.
CARDIAC CATH ([**2131-12-24**]): 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg.
There were moderately  elevated left sided filling pressures with a PCWP mean of 24 mmHg.
The cardiac index was normal at 2.9 L/min/m2.
CXR ([**2131-12-24**]): 1.
TTE ([**2131-12-25**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 73-year-old man with severe COPD and recently-diagnosed cardiomyopathy with EF 30%, who presented to an OSH on [**2131-12-21**] with symptoms of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization to assess for ischemic cardiomyopathy, which showed LAD disease.
He was admitted to the CCU for aspirin desensitization with plan for repeat cardiac catheterization and PCI.
Acute on chronic systolic CHF - The patient was recently diagnosed with a cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology, and was being treated for acute on chronic systolic heart failure prior to transfer.
Repeat TTE here revealed EF 15% with global LV dysfunction and no wall-motion-abnormalities to suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Coronary artery disease - The patient underwent cardiac catheterization that showed a left-dominant system, an LAD with diffuse 20-30% lesions throughout and mid-vessel 80% stenosis, and a LCx with mild luminal irregularities and mid-vessel eccentric 60% stenosis.
It was also suggested that he would need a viability study to assess for antero-apical myocardial viability in preparation for a potential PCI of his mid-LAD lesion, but his TTE showed no wall-motion-abnormalities to suggest ischemia as the reason for his cardiomyopathy, so there was felt to be no indication for viability study at this time.
Apical thrombus - The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for apical thrombus as the TTE done at OSH was unable to properly assess the apex.
# COPD - The patient has a history of severe COPD, with mild wheezes on exam on admission.
Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) 3.

You should discuss blood thinners with your cardiologist for your atrial fibrillation.
