Refer to respiratory viral culture for further information.
Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2130-4-27**]):       No respiratory viruses isolated.
Culture screened for Adenovirus, Influenza A & B, Parainfluenza type       1,2 & 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus..
Detection of viruses other than those listed above will only be       performed on specific request.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2130-5-2**]):    NO GROWTH, <1000 CFU/ml.

No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast however images were suboptimal and patient was unable to cooperate with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**4-26**] CT CHEST: CONCLUSION: 1.
Extensive multifocal consolidation in both lungs which on review of prior imaging has developed and progressed since the radiograph of [**2130-4-23**].
[**5-2**] RENAL U/S: FINDINGS: Study is slightly limited secondary to difficulties with patient positioning.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2130-5-8**] and [**5-7**], [**Numeric Identifier 66979**].
A swallowing videofluoroscopy study was done in conjunction with the speech pathology service.
Viral studies were negative.
- Acute renal failure: Cr noted to increase to 1.6 and urine studies were consistent with pre-renal state.
Renal ultrasound negative for hydronephrosis.
Ig levels were high; thus, no need for IVIG.
Another set of cultures (urine, blood) were sent but remained negative.
A CT head non-contrast was performed but showed no acute processes.
EEG was performed and showed no evidence of epileptic activity.
Azathioprine was held on admission (per above).
LFTs stabilized and Prednisone was increased to 40mg to further decrease patient's Liver Function Test.
On examination this sediment appeared to be stool.
Urinalysis and urine cultures were negative for infection.
CT of the abdomen with PO contrast was non conclusive.
During the stay B12, Folate, and reticulocyte count were all within normal limits.
