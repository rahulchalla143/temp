[**2107-2-28**] Cardiac Cath 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 43357**] was transferred from an OSH on [**2107-2-21**] with acute ischemia of her right lower extremity and a CT angiogram which showed thrombus involving the distal external iliac, common femoral and proximal superficial femoral and deep femoral arteries.
Upon transfer the patient was in florid pulmonary edema (as a result of contrast dye allergy), had EKG changes suggestive of an evolving MI and was intubated.
Coumadin was initiated and she remained on heparin until a therapeutic INR was reached.
An echo was obtained on [**2-22**] and was normal with an EF >55% without sign of thrombus.
On [**2107-2-28**] her INR was reversed with FFP and she was taken for a cardiac cath.
She was restarted on coumadin with a goal INR of 2.0-3.0  On [**2-25**] the bedside nurse noted the pt had difficulty swallowing and a speech/swallow consult was obtained.
A speech re-evaluation later confirmed that the pt was taking po's without difficulty.
