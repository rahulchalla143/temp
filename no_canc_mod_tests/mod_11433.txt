At that time, he ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a troponin of 10 and a peak CK of 796.
He had a cardiac catheterization which showed two of the saphenous vein grafts had been blocked but no intervention could be performed at that time.

In the Emergency Department, blood pressure was 110/80 on 12.5 of Dopamine.
normal saline bolus and was treated with Vancomycin and a dose of gentamicin due to a questionable infection of his right groin where his cardiac catheterization had been obtained.
Coronary artery disease status post four-vessel coronary artery bypass graft 22 years ago; status post recent myocardial infarction with catheterization which revealed two occluded SVG grafts, however, no intervention was performed.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 97.8 F.; pulse of 87; blood pressure 110/84; saturation of 97% on three liters, 91% on room air.

Lactate of 1.8, INR of 1.4.
Urinalysis revealed 11 to 20 white cells, few bacteria.
EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 89, Q waves in II, III and AVF, which is unchanged from [**2-23**].
Urine culture and blood cultures were pending.

The patient's blood pressure improved as well.
After blood cultures were negative times 48 hours, Vancomycin was discontinued and the patient was continued on Levaquin for urinary tract infection on which the patient will be discharged to complete a 14 day course.
