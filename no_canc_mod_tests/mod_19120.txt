Pt with CT findings compatible with "bamboo spine" likely secondary to ankylosing spondylitis with acute fracture at T11-12.
Follow up MRI revealed ankylosis of the cervical and thoracic spine.
Pt also noted to have large left-sided pleural effusion on CT of the chest.
Pt had Laminectomy T10-L2,  Pedicle screw insertion, segmental, T10-L3,  Local autograft, Posterolateral arthrodesis T10-L3, and fracture reduction, open, T10-L3.
Repeat chest CT on [**12-13**] demonstrated a  large simple left pleural effusion with partial loculation anteromedially, nodular pleural thickening in right hemithorax, highly suspicious for malignant mesothelioma in the setting of asbestos-related pleural plaques.
Further evaluation with PET/CT was requested when patient stabilized.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
They recommended urine cytology, CT urogram, and follow up in [**3-23**] weeks.
