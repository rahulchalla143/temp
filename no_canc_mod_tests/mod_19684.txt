DIAGNOSIS:  FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT  FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING  The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 7, 10, 19, 20, 23.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 57 yo M with a history of ITP and autoimmune hemolytic anemia who presented to OSH with epistaxis and plt of [**2148**], transferred here for further management.
# Thrombocytopenia/epistaxis/mucosal bleeding/petechiae: Felt to be due to ITP +/-degree of splenic sequestration given h/o enlarged spleen on prior CT scan.
Direct Coomb's test and ab screen are negative.
Plt still less than 5.
-heme/onc following, appreciate input; pending recs tomorrow will likely need repeat CT scan abdomen to eval degree of splenomegaly -give prednisone 120 mg today (1 mg/kg); per heme onc we may consider decadron -give dose of 120 mg IVIG ; Benadryl/Tylenol prior to and during IVIG infusions -recheck plt after IVIG; will discuss with heme whether to start decadron if plt count does not bump -Patient underwent a splenectomy on [**12-14**] and remained in the ICU monitoring his platelet count.
# Anemia/history of hemolytic anemia: Plt at OSH 44, 36 here.
Hemolytic labs are negative, so no evidence of hemolysis currently.
