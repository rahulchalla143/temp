When he arrived in the emergency department they got a heart rate in the 60s, RR of 12, and were evidently unable to obtain a blood pressure.
In the ED his EKG revealed diffuse ST depression, especially in v4-6; cardiology was consulted and ultimately did not feel that the EKG was significantly different than prior EKGs and was unlikely to represent an ischemic event.
An abdominal CT scan (based on elevated LFTs but normal Alk phos by labs as well as complaint of abdominal pain and diarrhea), and a head CT scan were performed; the abdominal CT showed no clear acute abdominal process, though could not use contrast for renal reasons; it did show some stranding around the distal colon and some gallbladder wall edema.
The head CT was also negative by initial read although a formal read was not available.
A chest x-ray showed atelectasis vs consolidation, while the bottom portion of the abdominal CT also showed effusion and atelectasis as well as an area of possible infectious consolidation.

Acute cholecystitis not entirely exclude, US and HIDA scan However, given symptomatology, further evaluation with HIDA scan could help differentiate.
Non-specific perirectal mild stranding, can be seen in the setting of proctitis or be related to third spacing.
TTE ([**2138-11-13**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2137-7-25**], the left ventricular systolic function is worse.
CXR ([**2138-11-14**]): Improvement of the left lower lobe opacification that could be atelectasis or area of pneumonia.

TTE did reveal worsening systolic function with EF 20% and severe diastolic dysfunction.
CT abdomen/pelvis revealed some mild gallbladder edema and possible colitis as well as a possible aspiration pneumonia, confirmed on CXR.
Blood cultures as well as urine legionella antigen were negative.
EBV, CMV and BK viral loads were sent for work-up of immunosuppressive-associated atypical infections though all of these were low or undetectable.
Urine cultures grew >100,000 yeast forms.
The patient presented with acute on chronic renal failure with Cr >4 up from baseline [**12-29**].
Renal transplant ultrasound revealed changes concerning for rejection.
Infectious work-up as above revealed a yeast UTI.
Rapamycin levels were supratherapeutic and this was transiently held.
Repeat rapamycin levels will be obtained by home nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 13835**] 1 week and sent to the patient's nephrologist for review and dosage adjustment.
His Cr stabilized but did not return to baseline at the time of discharge.
He was discharge with a clear plan to have home nurse INR checks and to continue close monitoring through the [**Hospital3 **].
Head CT obtained in the ED in the setting of lethargy revealed no acute bleeding but did show some interval change in appearance including hypoattenuation in the posterior left frontal lobe possibly consistent with enceophalomalacia and less likely interval stroke.
As evaluation for a non-specific irregularity in the area of the thyroid gland seen on CT, the patient underwent a thyroid ultrasound revealing a normal thyroid gland.
