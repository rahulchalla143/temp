He presented to OSH on [**1-16**] with temperature of 103 and worsening pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
On bedside echocardiogram was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion 1.2-1.9 cm initially and was treated with Toradol.
Echo today noted that it had increased to 2.1cm, mostly posterior, with septal flattening.
He was transferred for further evaluation and on arrival was found to have a large pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade.
Pericardiocentesis was performed with opening pressure 21 mmHg and removal of 410 cc serosanguinous fluid that was sent for laboratory evaluation which is pending.
Post-drainage pericardial pressure was 3 mmHg.
His breathing is improved but still limited by chest discomfort.
All of the other review of systems were negative except per HPI above.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: (-)Diabetes, (-)Dyslipidemia, (-)Hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - frequent sinus infections - nasal polyps removed [**4-16**] - distant history of ETOH abuse - cocaine/heroin abuse, hx of prior smoking.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 7 cm.

FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    RESULTS PENDING.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to large circumferential pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of early tamponade.
[**1-18**] REPEAT ECHO: Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %), possibly secondary to tachycardia.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-1-18**], pericardial effusion is smaller and echo signs of tamponade are no longer evident  [**1-18**] CXR: No focal consolidation is identified, but the retrocardiac area is dense and the left hemidiaphragm is indistinct.
Further evaluation with lateral view or lateral decubitus views should be considered  [**1-19**] REPEAT ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Cine loop #27 demonstrates transient flattening of interventricular septum during inspiration, suggesting ventricular interdependence and analogous to a physical Kussmaul's sign.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-1-18**], there is evidence of constrictive physiology.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The echo findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-1-19**], the findings are similar (and continue to suggest constriction).

# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: S/P tap and latest ECHO on [**1-21**] does not show reaccumulation of fluid.
Staph is likely a contaminant and 2 sets of blood cultures are pending at the time of this summary with NGTD in [**4-11**] days.
[**Known firstname **] will have an appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] in 1 month for a repeat ECHO and further assessment.
# Pneumonia: Noted prior to admission and CXR here showed ?
# Tachycardia: Sinus, rate 80's-low 100's, related to pain and inflammatory state, and nebs.
Abd exam benign.
Your liver function tests were elevated, this is likely because of a virus but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] will check them again in 1 week.
