BLOOD/FUNGAL CULTURE (Pending):    BLOOD/AFB CULTURE (Pending):  Brief Hospital Course: 79F with PVD, afib, CHF, COPD, GERD on chronic prednisone 10mg daily (for COPD) and neuropathy transferred here from NEBH [**10-4**] for RLE angiogram, which revealed significant PVD.
She did not undergo bronchoscopy in accordance with her wishes (she also had a recent bronch [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital for RUL opacity in [**Month (only) 205**], s/p bronchoscopy which revealed "diffuse mucus, cytology negative for malignancy" and also reportedly included fungal debris.
They also suggested investigating alternative fungal sources of pneumonia (sputum stains and cultures sent and are pending).
- F/u pending cultures (see below) - F/u with Ms. [**Known lastname 10881**] pulmonologist as an outpatient - F/u with ID (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4648**] on [**2130-11-6**]) .
Echo and chest CTA did not demonstrate cardiogenic etiology or PE.
Morning cortisol was 25 which speaks against adrenal insufficiency.
Noted that she has had some hem/onc work-up in the past, could be investigated as an outpatient.
Seems to be much improved now and stable though auscultation and CXR still suggest congestion - holding IV fluids for now, will consider duresis if resp status worsens.
- O2 with Sat goal 90-93% - continue levalbuterol nebs.
- continue prednisone at 10mg daily for now, needs taper - continue fluticasone-solumedrol diskus - ?
- sputum X3 for AFB + fungal cultures, nocardia, rhodococcus - needs outpatient follow-up - Can consider bronchoscopy as an outpatient if functional status improves, and patient is willing.
# R toe ulcer: No evidence of osteomyelitis on MRA at OSH.
- Incidental CT Chest: "T9 vertebra plana with retropulsion into the spinal canal, age indeterminate in the absence of prior imaging.
MRI is recommended for evaluation of intrathecal structures if clinically indicated."
Recommend followup imaging: unenhanced CT chest six to eight weeks following the initiation of antibiotic therapy to document resolution (ie, one month from discharge).

You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to have an angiogram of your right leg that showed a lot of blockages in the arteries in your leg.
Since your chest x-ray showed a possible pneumonia, we treated you with antibiotics and transferred you to the ICU for a brief amount of time but you were able to be transferred to the floor.
Some blood tests that showed you may have had a fungal infection in your lungs.
