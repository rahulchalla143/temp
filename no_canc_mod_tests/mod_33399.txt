CT [**2143-5-26**]: A left-sided subdural collection, that is predominantly hypodense, though demonstrates a rim of hyperdensity is not significantly changed in size or appearance from prior study, with the largest sections measuring up to 20 mm transversely.
Her head CT demonstrates a stable loculated left acute on chronic subdural collection and a probable old right occipital infarct.
She has a therapeutic INR of 2.7, and was given vitamin K at the outside hospital before being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Her INR was rechecked and had fallen to 1.8.
She had a repeat CT scan the following day which showed a stable chronic SDH, with some small area of fresh hemorrhage.
The patient continued to do well on the floor and her exam was at baseline.
Neurosurgery and Neurology discussed the SDH and the decision was made that as her exam was significantly improved and the bleed stable that it did not need surgical intervention at this time.
CVS - the patient maintained normal blood pressures.
She has a repeat CT in one week.
You were given vitamin K and your INR was allowed to drift down.
