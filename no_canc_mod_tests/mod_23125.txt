An EKG was doen in clinic and was concerning for TW inversions in V5-V6 and she was transferred to the ED for possible MI.
Catheterization revealed no left main disease or LAD disease.
Following Cath she developed chest pain and reported ST elevations.
Repeat cath revealed spiral dissection to distal vessels with proximal occlusion.
An IABP was placed to improve myocardial oxygenation and she was transfferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for managemetn of IABP.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Type 2 DM w/ A1c of 9 - Depression/anxiety - Hyponatremia, attributed to polydipsia and diuretic use - Seizure disorder - on Depakote and Keppra?
NECK: Supple with JVP of 11 cm.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
If indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast may better assess basl to mid RV free wall function  Repeat Echo few days later: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
# Coronaries/Chest pain: Symptoms and EKG findings (STE in Inferior leads III>II with STE in RV leads is consistent) consistent with RV infarct likely proximal RCA.
Troponin peaked at 1.28 and trended down.
Echo showed dilated RV with free wall hypokinesis.
Discharge Instructions: You had a cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 3105**] and one of your heart arteries was damaged and needed to be fixed with a bare etal stent.
Start taking Norvasc to control your blood pressure 4.
You will need to have some blood drawn on Monday to check your kidney function.
