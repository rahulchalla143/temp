He describes shortness of breath and mid chest pressure after carrying bundles approximately 100 feet, resolving with relaxation.
Because of these complaints he was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2185-3-8**] and underwent a persantine ETT (74% of predicted heart rate).
LVEF was noted at 57%.
He is now referred for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate.
Cardiac catherization was done on [**3-9**] which revealed LM 60%, 90% proximal ramus, serial LAD- 70% diagonal branch, D2 100% occluded, proximal LCX disease 70-80%, RCA 100% occluded.
Mr [**Known lastname 61836**] was evaluated for Coronary artery bypass graft and was taken to the OR on [**3-16**] once he completed his plavix washout and his creatinine which had elevated after his cath dye load had returned to baseline.
On [**3-16**] 09 Mr. [**Known lastname 61836**] had a CABg x 4- LIMA-LAD, SVgrafts to Om, Ramus, PDA.
Metformin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): please follow creatinine weekly or more frequently if elevated.
