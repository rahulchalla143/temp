HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old male with a past medical history significant for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and prostate cancer who was transferred from the [**Hospital3 3583**] for further treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure.
Chest x-ray revealed small right lower lobe and left lower lobe infiltrates.
The patient was afebrile with a white blood cell count of 12.8, a blood pressure of 86/40 with a heart rate of 130, 97% 02 saturation on four liters.
A CT scan was obtained revealing diffuse ground glass opacities with extensive  emphysematous changes without lymphadenopathy or tumor seen.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION TO THE [**Hospital6 **]:  Temperature 101 rectally.
Pulse 70.
Blood pressure 120/60.
Oxygen saturation 88% on assist control ventilation 750/14, pressure support of 7, PEEP of 5 on 100% FIO2, PIP of 24 and a plateau 23.
Weight 72 kg.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam:  Pupils 1 mm bilaterally reactive.
Distal pulses 1+ bilaterally.
NOTABLE LABORATORIES:  [**2145-1-29**]:  White blood cell count 12.8, hematocrit 53.
[**2-3**]:  White blood cell count 13.5 with hematocrit of 49.
[**2-5**] at the outside hospital white blood cell count 23.8, hematocrit 48.
On presentation to [**Hospital6 256**], white blood cell count 15.8, hematocrit 44.6, platelets 466.
Sodium 143, potassium 4.7, chloride 110, bicarbonate 23, BUN 35, creatinine 0.8, glucose 126, calcium 7.8, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 5.0.
Arterial blood gases on AC 7.34/45/213 on 100% oxygen assist controlled ventilation 600 x 20 and a PEEP of 10.
A Gram stain sputum from [**2-2**]:  Moderate epithelial cells, moderate gram positive rods, moderate gram positive cocci, moderate pleomorphic gram negative rods.
Blood culture from [**2145-1-29**]: No growth to date times two sets.
Transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside hospital:  Normal ejection fraction 55% with normal valves.
CT scan of the chest on [**2-5**]:  Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis, emphysematous changes bilaterally diffusely with occasional large bulla, diffuse ground glass appearance.
Chest x-ray on [**2-5**]:  Diffuse opacities bilaterally without pneumothorax and normal heart size.
A bronchoscopy was performed which revealed nonspecific changes.
The patient's ventilator settings were adjusted as necessary to maintain stable oxygen saturations and minimize pressures.
Multiple cultures were sent including a bronchoscopy sample which was negative for pneumocystis and legionella and positive for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
Multiple blood cultures and sputum cultures were negative.
The patient continued to have temperatures and despite multiple cultures and changing of access lines, the patient's cultures remained negative.
He did not respond to this and an amiodarone drip was started along with blood pressure support from pressors.
Fluid status:  The patient received large amounts of intravenous fluids to support his blood pressure throughout the admission.
He was ultimately 22 liters positive for the length of stay.
The patient's family was informed of these complications and he suffered no further complications from the chest tube.
One of the patient's sons, however, was in disagreement regarding this plan.
The patient's vital signs declined throughout the remaining course of the day.
Examination confirmed this and the patient was pronounced dead at 1:22 in the afternoon on [**2145-2-25**].
A postmortem examination was refused by the family who was at the patient's bedside.
