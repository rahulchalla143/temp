There, a CT of the chest and abdomen demonstrated an ascending aortic dissection and was subsequently transferred here for further management.
Upon arrival, he did not have the CT scans with him so we repeated the CT scan, and again the finding was seen in the ascending aorta but I was suspicious that this was not a dissection since the so-called flap was irregular in nature and was very limited and I could not follow it up the aorta as in the case of a usual dissection.
Therefore, I called Cardiology where a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was performed.
Therefore, we brought him up to the operating room, where under MAC he had a transesophageal echocardiogram performed and this demonstrated that there was a mass and not a dissection.
His INR at that time was about 7 and therefore I elected to wait until we brought it down before resecting this mass.
