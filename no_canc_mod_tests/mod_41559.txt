In the Emergency Department, the patient had a chest x-ray which showed near complete opacification in the left hemithorax with mild shift of the trachea and mediastinum to the right.
A CT scan was subsequently performed to correlate these findings.
At that time, the patient was admitted to the medical Intensive Care Unit for further care.
Echocardiogram performed on [**2141-1-23**] showed an ejection fraction of 45%.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.4; heart rate 80; blood pressure 94/34; respiratory rate 20; oxygen saturation 97% on six liters nasal cannula.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT: Normal cephalic, atraumatic.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the left base.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 21.3; hematocrit of 31.3; platelets 224.
Differential showed 88 neutrophils, 8 lymphocytes and 3 monocytes.
Chemistry revealed a sodium of 135; potassium of 4.4; chloride of 96; bicarbonate of 24; BUN 26; creatinine 2.0, elevated from a baseline of .8 and glucose of 142.
CK 188; CK MB 13; troponin T 0.75.
On the evening of admission, she was admitted to the medical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment.
The case was discussed with both interventional pulmonary and CT surgery.
A small, apical, left sided pneumothorax was visualized on chest x-ray which resolved after the chest tube was removed.
The patient was hypotensive on admission with systolic blood pressures in the 90's.
These were slowly titrated up as tolerated, to control blood pressure throughout the remainder of the admission.
Her beta blocker and Lasix were re-added as her blood pressure allowed.
Her creatinine trended down to baseline with intravenous fluids.
A Clostridium difficile has been sent and is currently pending.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition.
Her electrolytes were repleted as needed.
