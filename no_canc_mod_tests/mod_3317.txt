He was admitted from his PCP's office to an OSH for evaluation of new pan-cytopenia 2.1>28%<83, acute renal failure and symptoms of fatigue and weakness.

Of note, his blood cultures have grown out Ampicillin sensitive enterococci, and he had a TTE just yesterday showing a large aortic valve vegetation.

TTE [**2166-7-8**]: Conclusions The left atrium is dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
TTE [**2166-7-11**]: Conclusions The interventricular septum and apex of the left ventricle are hypokinetic.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-7-8**], the findings are similar.
CT CHEST [**2166-7-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT HEAD W/O [**2166-7-11**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
An MR may be obtained for further evaluation if the clinical concern persists.
TTE [**2166-7-16**]: Conclusions Focused views to assess size of known aortic valve vegetation and degree of aortic regurgitation.
The larger of the aortic valve vegetations previously seen on complete studies dated [**2166-7-8**] and [**2166-7-11**] is now characterized by a wider base (more linear and mobile on the prior studies).
An abscess was not visualized but cannot be excluded on the base of this study.
TTE [**2166-7-23**]: Focused study.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**7-16**]/201, the vegetation size appears similar but the severity of aortic regurgitation is slightly increased.
Cardiology followed the pt and felt that his chest pain was [**2-12**] heart failure and volume overload.
# Enterococcal endocarditis: Pt has a history of enterococcal UTI in setting of past prostatectomy/radiation and radiation cystitis with a recent admission in [**2166-1-11**] for enterococcal UTI.
TTE showed a large aortic valve vegetation, with EF 40-45%.
He had a PA cathether placed which suggested more of a septic than cardiogenic picture of hypotension.
Repeat TTE on [**7-11**] showed no change, with no severe AI.
TTE was again repeated on [**7-16**], and showed mildly increased base of vegetation, but continued mild-moderate AR.
Per CT surgery, no intervention given AR not severe.
Repeat echo done [**2166-7-23**] that showed a stable vegetation with slight increase in aortic regurgitation.
Last positive blood culture was [**2166-7-10**].
All following cultures were negative at the time of discharge and the patient remained afebrile.
He should continue to have a chem 7, CBC and LFT panel done weekly, with results faxed to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in the infectious disease department at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11959**].
He had a line holiday given bacteremia as discussed above, on [**2166-7-18**] a tunneled HD line was placed.
ECG demonstrated ST depressions in precordial and lateral leads.
Cardiac enzymes were trended and remained stable.
Fluid overload, with components of acute pulmonary edema and chronic lung disease.
SPEP resulted as slightly abnormal, and repeat SPEP continued to show abnormalities.
EBV serologies showed positive IgG and IgM, of unclear significance.
Parvovirus showed positive IgG, negative IgM.
A CT head showed no acute process.
Patient was transferred to an LTAC at [**Hospital1 1872**]  Medications on Admission: HOME MEDICATIONS: - Imdur 90 mg 1XD - Humalog 8 units PRN - Docusate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN - Miralax PRN - Nitroglycerin SL PRN - Multivitamin 2 tabs 1XD - Ranexa 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] - Crestor 10 mg 1XD - Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] - Tylenol PRN - Calcium carbonate 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] - Percocet 5 1 tab Q4H PRN - Zofran 4 mg PO PRN .
Meds on transfer to MICU ([**2166-7-5**]): Tylenol prn Ampicillin 2 G IV Q12H since [**7-8**] at 1450 Docusate [**Hospital1 **] Heparin 5000 SC TID Insulin sliding scale Ipratropium neb Isosorbide mononitrate ER 60mg daily Metoprolol tartrate 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] Nitroglycerin SL 0.3 prn CP Nephrocaps 1 daily Nitroglycerin ointment 2% Senna [**Hospital1 **] prn Sevelamer carbonate 1600mg PO TID with meals .
You also had episodes of chest pain that were relieved with nitroglycerin and your ECG showed changes that were consistent with your known heart disease and the extra demand on your heart from the infection.
You are going to a long term acute care facility to help you regain strength and to continue to monitor your kidney function and heart valve infection.
Medication we changed while in the hospital: Imdur was decreased (for blood pressure and chest pain) Metoprolol was increased (for heartrate control) Take atorvastatin instead of rosuvastatin for cholesterol .
