Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: rectal tube placement  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo F with [**Hospital 31756**] transfered from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with abdominal distension, discomfort, and liquid stool for 2 weeks.
Past Medical History: dementia, depression, COPD, dysphagia, spinal stenosis, legally blind, urinary retention, GERD  Social History: Lives at [**Hospital 100**] rehab  Family History: Non-contributary  Physical Exam: T 98.6  HR 65  BP 158/82  RR 18  SO2: 91% on RA GEN: pt awake and responding appropriately to questions HEENT: PERRLA Resp: CTAB CV: RRR AB: + bs, soft, nt, nd Ext: no edema psych: oriented to person  Pertinent Results: KUB [**8-12**] 4:30 pm: IMPRESSION: Massively dilated sigmoid colon gas with a coffee bean appearance in the mid-abdomen, highly suspicious for sigmoid volvulus.
KUB [**8-12**] 6:20 pm: IMPRESSION: Interval placement of sigmoid tube with decompression of previously seen sigmoid volvulus.
KUB [**2132-8-13**] 8:10 IMPRESSION: Decompression of previously seen sigmoid volvulus.
KUB [**2132-8-13**] 4:00 pm  IMPRESSION: 1.
KUB [**2132-8-16**] 10:20 PM  The rectal tube has been withdrawn to the level of the rectum.
If there is continuing clinical concern for ischemia, CT with intravenous contrast may be helpful.
KUB [**2132-8-17**] 6:23 PM  The rectal tube has been placed more proximally within the sigmoid.
COLON (GASTROGRAF) [**2132-8-19**] 11:02 AM  GASTROGRAFIN ENEMA: Gastrografin was administered per rectum under constant fluoroscopic guidance.
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2132-8-20**] Conclusions:  The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure(PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Serial abdominal exams showed improvement of tenderness, and the rectal tube was removed on HD2.
Serial KUB's showed resolution of volvulus.
Bedside swallow eval was performed on HD3 that yielded recommendations to have a diet of p.o.
On HD3 the pt's diet was advanced, however the pt became more distended and repeat KUB demonstrated recurrence of her volvulus.
EKG and cardiac enzymes were found to be negative for acute MI.
