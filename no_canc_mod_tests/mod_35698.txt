Oxygen saturation of 72% on 2L.
EKG revealed increased prominence of previously appreciated ST elevations and a heparin drip was started per a cardiology consult.
Chest xray revealed no significant changes compared to prior studies, the findings of which were bilateral perihilar haziness and slight peritrachial cuffin, mild upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature, and a small right effusion.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Chest xray revealed no infiltrates.
Etiology of the COPD exacerbation was thought secondary to not taking prednisone after last hospital discharge; he reported the prescription was never called in and he quickly decompensated.
The patient continued to deny chest pain and when all cardiac markers were flat, the patient's heparin drip was discontinued.
Aspirin was continued and an ECHO was obtained to ensure the patient did not suffer a cardiac insult.
The results of that study are above, but essentially revealed no significant change from prior studies.
With respect to blood pressures, the patient was noted to be hypertensive during the duration of his stay in the ICU.
Thus, the patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of metformin with the thought that as steroids are decreased, blood sugar levels will similarly become better controlled.
