Admission Date:  [**2193-2-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2193-2-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-5-20**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (with an ejection fraction of 20%), rheumatic heart disease, status post aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement in [**2186**], chronic atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin), status post pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement for symptomatic bradycardia in [**2192-10-22**] who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital on the day of admission for a cardiac catheterization in the setting of congestive heart failure exacerbation and elevation in cardiac enzymes (thought to be associated with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction).
Her troponin I was checked at that time and showed a peak at 6.44.
Her creatine kinase levels peaked in the 200s.
Her electrocardiogram was without changes at that time.
She had a B&T level also checked which was elevated at 1600.
The patient went to catheterization at the outside hospital which showed a left anterior descending artery lesion of 85% occlusion which was increased from a 50% occlusion in her catheterization in [**2192-4-22**].
She had an episode of acute pulmonary edema prior to catheterization and was given intravenous nitroglycerin, intravenous Lasix, and 4 mg of morphine with improvement in her oxygen saturations.
Automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator and dual-chamber pacemaker placed in [**2192-10-22**] for symptomatic bradycardia.
Baseline renal insufficiency (with a creatinine of 1.3 to 1.5).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was afebrile, her blood pressure was 144/70, her heart rate was 63, she was breathing at 16, and her oxygen saturation was 99% on 4 liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Neck revealed her jugular venous pressure was approximately 8 cm.
Respiratory issues revealed she had decreased breath sounds at the bases with crackles on the right side greater than the left.
Her heart examination was irregularly irregular with a 3/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border with radiation to the apex and the back.
She had a first heart sound and second heart sound mechanical click.
Her abdominal examination was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  At the outpatient hospital, her peak MB was 22.4 and her peak troponin I was 6.44.
Her creatinine on admission was 1.5.
Her hematocrit was 37.2, and platelets were 232.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING FINDINGS:  Her electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a left bundle-branch block with occasional A-paced rhythm.
Her cardiac catheterization on [**2193-2-1**] showed a left-dominant system with left main coronary artery with a 40% lesion, a left anterior descending artery 80% lesion to the bifurcation of the diagonal, and a left circumflex lesion of 50% at the obtuse marginal with distal occlusion, the left posterior descending artery and right coronary artery with luminal irregularities, and a Taxus stent was placed in her left anterior descending artery lesion.
Her filling pressures with a right atrial pressure mean of 12, right ventricular pressure of 45 systolic and 5 diastolic, and a wedge pressure of 25, and a pulmonary artery diastolic of 25, cardiac output of 4.8, and an index of 3.04.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Pump:  The patient had a high wedge pressure and a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
The patient had an echocardiogram done on the day of discharge which showed an ejection fraction of 20% to 30%; which was similar to prior.
She was placed on a heparin drip until she was therapeutic on her Coumadin (her goal INR is 2.5 to 3.5).
Prior to discharge, the patient's INR level was 3.5.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient was given Mucomyst after her catheterization given her baseline renal insufficiency and her dye load during the procedure.
Her creatinine remained stable between 1.3 and 1.5 throughout her hospital stay.
Liver function tests, amylase, and lipase were checked which were all within normal limits.
The patient had no changes in her electrocardiogram during her period of nausea.
The patient was also to have her INR checked in the next two to three days.
