HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient had an echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] of this year which showed critical aortic stenosis and preserved left ventricular function with a valvular area of 0.6 cm sq, peak gradient of 60 and mean gradient of 40.
LABORATORY DATA:  Prior to admission white count 6.0, hematocrit 34.7, platelet count 265,000, sodium 139, potassium 5.1, chloride 102, CO2 24, BUN 26, creatinine 1.5, glucose 218.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs 61 inches, weight 139 lbs, heart rate 65, blood pressure 145/79 on the left and 129/82 on the right.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the cardiac catheterization lab.
In summary, the cath report showed aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of .6 cm sq, a mean gradient of 50, preserved ventricular function with an EF of 50% and an RCA with an 80% mid vessel stenosis.
Her mean arterial pressure was 88, her CVP was 12.
In addition, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, however, somewhat hypertensive and she was begun on Nipride to control her blood pressure.
Captopril was added to her regime of Nipride to try to control her blood pressure.
Over the next several days the patient remained hemodynamically stable, her activity level was increased on a daily basis with the assistance of physical therapy and on postoperative day #8 it was decided that the patient would be appropriate to discharge to home with the assistance of VNA for nursing assessment and physical therapy on the following day.
Physical exam at time of discharge, vital signs, temperature 96.6, heart rate 81, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 132/70, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 96% on room air.
Respiratory clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Weight preoperatively is 62.8 kg, at discharge is 65 kg.
