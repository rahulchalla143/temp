EEG revealed severe encephalopathy.
# Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per prior labs in OMR.
Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of insensible losses and acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a pre-renal picture.
Her creatinine remained in the 0.7 to 0.9 range on the floor.
Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7 which is also at recent baseline.
# DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
Her blood sugars are well controlled with levels >200 only once every other day and usually in the setting of high carbohydrate intake.
Appears to be chronic, prior work ups suggested hypersensitivity reaction which was confirmed by Eosinophils on prior derm biopsy.
