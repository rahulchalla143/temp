An MRCP would be helpful in order to assess for any obstructive process.
Correlation with pancreatitic enzymes to exclude coincident pancreatitis is recommended.
EEG [**2-25**]: BACKGROUND: Consisted of a 10 Hz posterior predominant rhythm bilaterally.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be done as this was a  portable EEG.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rate and rhythm with a rate of approximately 70 bpm.
ECHO [**2-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2135-5-4**], there is less tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary pressures are lower .
MRI ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2136-2-26**]: 1.
Gallbladder wall edema/pericholecystic fluid is not a specific finding.
If clinical concern exists for chronic cholecystitis, a HIDA scan would be the study of choice.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2136-2-28**]: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest are reviewed, and compared with the previous study of [**2136-2-25**].
[**Numeric Identifier 7670**] FLUORO 1 HR W/RADIOLOGIST  [**2136-3-8**]: Successful conversion from a temporary left internal jugular to a tunneled hemodialysis catheter (27 cm from cuff to tip).
A LP was performed to rule out meningitis in setting of witnessed seizure.
Patient's mental status and respiratory acidosis improved and he was extubated on [**2-26**] after a RSBI ~10.
Repeat CXR was improved but continued to show pulmonary edema.
MRI/MRA/MRV were negative for emboli or other abnormalities.
Repeat ECHO this admission largely unchanged from prior if not improved.
EEG was negative for seizure.
Plan is to have patient follow-up with a repeat MRI and see neurology as an outpatient in [**6-21**] weeks time.
Calcium was repleted aggressively while alkalinizing his urine to prevent further renal damage.
Etiology of acute renal failure likely secondary to hypovolemia during cardiac arrest and rhabdomyolysis.
He will need to have his electrolytes (Chem 7, calcium, magnesium, phosphate) checked in 48 hours, 1 week, and two weeks to ensure recovery of kidney function.
It was recommended in [**2130**] that he have his R ankle amputated however patient decided not to have the amputation and to medically treat his chronic pain.
Hct baseline 29.0.
Initially, RUQ US suggestive for cholecystitis however subsequent abdominal MRI showed prominent extrahepatic bile duct tapers normally and demonstrates no evidence of choledocholithiasis.
Liver was consulted and recommended the following tests: VZV IgG negative, CMV negative, ceruloplasmin wnl, Hep A, B, C negative, [**Doctor First Name **] and anti-smooth Ab negative, IgG low, HSV1 IgG-, HSV2 IgG-, EBV IgG+ IgM-.
Alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin began to downtrend without intervention and so no HIDA/MRCP was pursued.
Differential diagnosis included seizure versus infectious etiology.
HTN: Continued to hold BP agents and follow SBP closely.
Obstructive sleep apnea: Unclear whether patient suffers from this but he can schedule a sleep study as outpatient.
Abnormal chest x-ray findings: Patient will need to follow-up with chest x-ray with PA/LAT/bilateral shallow oblique views to re-evaluated possible nodular opacity in right apex of lung seen on chest x-ray [**2136-2-28**].

HCTZ 25mg QD 4.
Please get repeat chest x-ray (PA/LAT/bilateral shallow oblique views) to re-evaluated possible nodular opacity in right apex of lung seen on chest x-ray [**2136-2-28**].
Please remember to get a repeat brain MRI as scheduled by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7673**].
You will need the following labs checked on [**2136-3-14**], [**3-19**], [**2136**], and [**2136-3-26**].
