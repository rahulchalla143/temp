Microbiology: Blood cultures 8/20 x1, and [**8-20**] x 2 - no growth (final) Blood cultures 8/23 x2, [**8-23**] x2 - no growth to date Stool for c diff x 2 - negative R knee joint fluid [**8-22**] - no growth (final) L heel eschar swab [**8-22**] - no growth L heel eschar swab [**8-23**] - rare growth coagulase negative Staph L heel foot culture [**8-23**] - rare growth coagulase negative Staph  [**8-18**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION - right dominant, three vessel native coronary artery disease.
LAD 80% origin stenosis, totally occluded mid vessel; D2 branch 70% lesion.

Blood cultures 8/23 and [**8-23**] show no growth to date.
CT surgery was consulted regarding valve replacement because it was felt that given aortic root abscess and conduction abmormalities the patient may benefit from early surgical intervention.
CAD - 3VD s/p CABGx2 s/p enzyme leak on [**8-7**] CK peak 582, MB peak 5.2, index only 1.0, TropI peak 5.3 likely due to demand ischemia.
The patient had cardiac catheterization performed on [**2124-8-18**] which revealed that all 3 venous grafts were patent.
The patent has been tachycardic with HR in 90-100 most of the time.
TSH was checked and was normal.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] electrophysiology study on [**8-24**] which showed AVN and HIS disease, but given the dynamic nature of his problem in the context of abscess, the decision was made to re-evaluate the patient in 2 weeks and to leave temporary pacer wire in place for now.
HTN - The patient's blood pressures have been controlled with low dose beta-blocker.
CHF - EF40%; The patient has been euvolemic through most of his hospital stay.
MS changes/confusion - were thought to be likely due to infection.
CT of head was negative on [**8-19**] and was also negative at the outside hospital.
Renal - The patient's creatinine slowly increased from Cr 1.3 to 2.5 on [**8-27**].
Anemia - The patient received blood transfusions on [**9-22**], [**8-25**], [**8-26**] to keep Hct at goal >30 .
CT abd/pelvis done because of concern for thromboemboli did not show any retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Thrombocytopenia at the outside hospital with Plt count 145->95->72 over 2 days (HIT Ab negative x 1 at OSH).
Plain hip films were done and did not show obvious pathology.
R knee pain/effusion - R knee was tapped [**2124-8-23**] by Orthopedic surgery and fluid culture was negative results suggestive of non-inflammatory effusion.
CT [**8-22**] showed no evidence of OM.
The decision was made to proceed with bone scan which was done on [**8-24**] and showed finding c/w OM of left heel.
ALB 2.3 He passed video swallowing evaluation [**8-23**].
