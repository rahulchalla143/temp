Hepatitis B and hepatitis C. 2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, her blood pressure was 156/101, heart rate 76, respirations 18, 97% O2 saturation on 2 liters.
Neurologic examination was grossly normal.
LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperatively showed a hematocrit of 37.2, platelet count 264.
Other coagulation and chemistry studies were normal.
Serial CPKs were 51, 36, and 448 with troponins of 1.2, 0.7, and 3.4.
Cardiac catheterization on [**5-6**] showed 40% left main, 90% left anterior descending artery, and diffuse RCA disease with an ejection fraction of 60%.
Electrocardiogram showed anterior T-wave inversions and diffuse ST changes.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral atelectasis with no other changes.
Her index picked up over the course of the day and her intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued.
Her hemodynamics were stable, but an electrocardiogram demonstrated T-wave inversion laterally similarly to preoperative, but new compared to postoperative.
She refused cardiac catheterization at that time, so a Persantine MIBI was done on [**5-21**], which demonstrated the same reversible defect as preoperative with only minimal improvement.
On examination on the day of discharge, her lungs were clear bilaterally.
Her sternum was stable and there was minimal pedal edema.
Her discharge weight was 82.4.
On day of discharge, her blood pressure is 118/62 with respiratory rate of 20 and is sating 96% on room air.
Her laboratories showed a white count of 18.9, hematocrit of 33, platelet count of 255,000.
Sodium 139, potassium 3.2, chloride 107, CO2 22, BUN 30, creatinine 0.9 with a blood sugar of 92.
Hepatitis B and hepatitis C. 3.
