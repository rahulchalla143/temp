Also cycled his enzymes and checked his cholesterol.
His CK was initially over 6000, and this was thought to be early washout after revascularization.
However, repeat numbers trended down from here for several readings, with his last value=1325.
He had a fairly loud murmur, so we got an echo the day after MI.
He was found to have an EF of 30-35%.
His electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed.
After this time, he will be seen again by a cardiologist who can reevaluate his work status and repeat an echocardiogram to check his current LV function.
Max 3 tabs/15 minutes.
