Her O2 sat was dropping into 80's hence and she was not following any commands hence she was emergently intubated in the ED.
She underwent emergent imaging including CT of head and CTA of head and neck which showed large R cortical/subcortical hemorrhage with extensions into all ventricles and some midline shift.
On Discharge: deceased  Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2161-10-17**] 1.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2161-10-18**] 1.
MRI brain [**10-19**]: 1.
Unchanged foci of hemorrhage within the brainstem, in the setting of slight downward transtentorial herniation, raising the possibility of duret hemorrhage  ECHO [**2161-10-20**] Mild to moderate spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is borderline (LVEF= 55 %).
[**2161-10-21**] CT head 1.
CXR [**2161-10-21**] Now mild pulmonary edema has markedly improved.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2161-10-23**] 2:00 AM Final Report FINDINGS: Compared to the earlier examination, there is little change in the appearance of a right frontoparietal craniectomy with herniation of the brain to the calvarial defect.
Limited evaluation by streak artifact, but the appearance of the posterior fossa with brainstem hemorrhage, ambient cistern effacement and downward transtentorial herniation is unchanged.
CXR [**2161-10-23**]: IMPRESSION: Progression of left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity indicating left lower lobe consolidation, possible additional right lower lobe consolidation.
Pulmonary vascular engorgement and moderate cardiomegaly.
She underwent emergent CT and CTA which showed R SDH.
On [**10-18**], post operative head CT was stable.
EVD was at 10 and clamped when patient's exam worsened to extensor posturing in BUE and triple flexion in BLE.
On [**10-19**], patient's exam did not improve, MRI head was done which revealed punctate infarcts in b/l frontal, parietal, occipital and brainstem.
Echo was ordered as well as blood cultures.
On [**10-20**], patient's exam remained the same.
Echocardiogram showed no vegetation/emboli.
Renal US and LE dopplers were negative.
On [**10-21**] she had ICP elevations to 27-29.
Her ICP increased to low 40's and she became briefly asystolic.
THe drain was reopened and her ICP decreased to mid 20's and her HR returned to [**Location 213**].
A stat head ct obtained showed no change from her previous exam.
Her cultures remained negative on this day.
