Pertinent Results: CXR PA/LAT ([**2190-10-7**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
CXR PA/LAT ([**2190-10-12**]): Stable small bilateral pleural effusions, possibly slightly decreased on the left.

She was treated with bicarb and transitioned to normal saline and her potassium normalized.
Possibly related to NSVT and non-perfusing rhythm, which resolved spontaneously.
Her BP was fluid responsive though UOP slowed during the time of these episodes.
CXR showed small b/l pleural effusions.
She was given 80mg IV lasix, nitro s/l x3, 100mg po labetalol and albuterol/atrovent nebs with improvement in her BP to 140/90 and resolution of her SOB and chest tightness.
Her HTN was felt to be [**3-10**] fluid overload.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.
C diff was negative and cipro was stopped s/p 7d course for UTI.
# ARF: Pt was dry on initial exam and in the setting of markedly increased ostomy output, this could be pre-renal failure, liekly c/b ATN given delayed response to IVF.
Urine eos were negative.
Her serum Cr was downtrending at the time of discahrge and renal signed off with instructions to f/u in clinic.
Most recent Cr was 3.1 and she was making >1cc/kg/hr of urine.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 110906**] has Renal follow up; it is important that she see the nephrologist to f/u resolution of her ARF.
# DM: On admission to the floor, BG was 43, likely [**3-10**] insulin/glucose in the ED.
She received juice and repeat BG was 25-->32-->89.
Notably, she needs PCP follow up for her BP and cognitive impairment and nephrology follow up for ATN.
