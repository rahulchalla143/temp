cath [**5-28**]: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
One day following admission, patient developed additional chest pain and hypoxia initially read in o2 sat of 70s requiring 10L of O2 at which patient was 93% (abg was 7.35/34/90 on 10L face-mask), patient's systolic blood pressure was also in 100s compared to baseline of 130s.
CT on [**8-29**] showed: LLL PNA, effusion, enlargement of nodule at left lung apex and new nodule in the medial LUL nodule, possibly representing differences in slice selection compared to [**9-30**].
Patient will need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] regarding further work-up of these findings.
(A contrast CT was not performed secondary to the patient's CRI.)
Labs on [**8-31**] notable for HCT 25.5, Retic 0.7, LDH normal, INR of 1.6,  Cr at 1.6 (down from elevated 1.9 on admission), of note Trop maximum at 0.83 and an echo was performed on [**8-29**] which demonstrated normal systolic function, therefore felt to represent possible RV strain.
Patient o2 sat was 94% while ambulating on discharged but with subjective feeling of intermittent dyspnea we discharge with oxygen.
Patient will also be discharged on Lovenox SC, until INR is therapeutic.
Fever - Patient with AIDS, history of fever and chest xray/chest CT notable for PNA.
Blood cultures / urine cultures in-house were negative.
Reticulocyte low, LDH normal, D bili was slightly elevated.
An echo demonstrated intact systolic function.
Neurology/History of seizure - Maintain on kepra.
Anemia - Patient presented with a hematocrit of 34, wide variation in baseline (34-44).
Throughout hospitalization hematocrit went down to 25 but stabilized.
Iron studies demonstrated low iron, low b12.
