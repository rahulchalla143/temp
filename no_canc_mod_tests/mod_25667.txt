Small amount of ascites around the gallbladder and in the right and left lower quadrants consistent with free fluid seen on recent CT scan.
OSH CT Abd/Pel: ([**2108-7-29**]) moderately severe pancreatic bed inflammtory soft tissue stranding.
Brief Hospital Course: # Acute pancreatitis: Pt had acute onset abdominal pain, N/V with elevated lipase and OSH CT with pancreatic inflammation, tissue stranding, no fluid collections.
An abdominal U/S was limited due to pain and body habitus, but no gallstones were visualized on exam.
Urine tox came back negative.
His urine output was 70-75ml/hr.
Additionally, morning labs were concerning for hypocalcemia to 6.4 down from 7.1 the previous day, hyperbilirubinemia with a bump from 2.1 to 7.1, low phos at 1.0, and a Hct drop of 7 points from 45 to 37.9.
A stat AP CXR and KUB was followed up.
He was then transferred to the ICU for further eval.
He had a repeat CT abd with contrast that showed are of necrotizing pancreatitis, and extend of splenic thrombus now completely obstructing his splenic vein and extending into portal vein.
Pt also had significant drop on his HCT 45->35->31 that was concerning for retroperitoneal bleed and he was given 1 unit of PRBCs.
He was HD stable and his Hct has remained stable.
Hepatology did an EGD in the AM for evaluation of esophageal bleed.
His IVF were discontinued and his diet was progressed.
His captopril was increased from 12.5mg to 37.5mg for better blood pressure control.
Hct was stable at around 35.
His calcium was followed and was repleted on the first day back on the floor.
A repeat CT scan was done prior to discharge which revealed fluid around the pancreas that was immature and not organizing; surgery evaluated the patient and did not feel it was necessary to drain.
# GI Bleed: Pt had a Hct drop from 45 to 39->37 with hemocult positive coffee ground vomitus.
He is tachycardic to 120s and BP is 150/90.
He was HD stable and his Hct has remained stable.
Hepatology did an EGD in the AM for evaluation of esophageal bleed.
His Hct was stable for the rest of his stay on the floor.
His AST/ALT ratio is 2 while his LFTs do not exceed 500s which is also consistent with this dx.
His skin looks tan which could be due to sun exposure and jaundice, however given symptoms we checked iron studies and serum ferritin.
Once on floor, his oxygen sats resolved to 96% RA after he no longer required fluid resuscitation.
His hypoxia is more likely secondary to his apparent third spacing/ascites and contributing pulmonary edema, although retrocardic opacity was seen on CXR last night.
All cultures pending this AM.
His BP remained elevated and the atenolol dose was increased to 50mg.
