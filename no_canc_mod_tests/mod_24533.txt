Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Renal ultrasound [**2194-10-25**]: IMPRESSION: No interval change in appearance of the kidneys in comparison to the exam from one day prior: 1.
GI bleed: Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] had a hct of 20.3 at presentation with black stool that were guaiac positive.
NG lavage was negative and he remained hemodynamically stable.
EGD showed an AVM in his stomach that was successfully cauterized.
His hct was repleted with 7 units of pRBC's total and he retained a stable Hct of ~30.
Diagnostic tap of the peritoneal fluid was suggestive of cardiac ascites with a serum ascites albumin gradient > 1.1 and total protein > 2.5.
Abd ultrasound showed nodular echotexture of the liver with irregular contour suggestive of cirrhosis.
LFT's were within normal limits and there was appropriate synthetic function with a serum albumin of 3.7.
Hepatitis panel was positive for hep A antibodies and negative for hep B and hep C. Hep C PCR is still pending.
Heart failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] had an aortic valve replacement in [**2181**], and was diagnosed with heart failure six years ago in [**Hospital1 46**].
We obtained a TTE which revealed an EF of 25% with 4+ TR and MR and 4 chamber dilation.
Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] ever having a heart attack and he had a cardiac cath in [**2181**] that showed clean coronaries.
His TTE showed 4+ TR and MR likely due to dilation of the heart.
His INR drifted down to 1.6 after his GI studies and his coumadin was restarted with a heparin bridge.
His INR at discharge was 1.9. .
With gentle diuresis his Cr trended down to 2.3 on the day of discharge.
You were transfused with blood and had a upper GI endoscopy done which showed one bleeding site that was cauterized.
The culture from the fluid was still pending at the time of discharge, and your PCP can follow up on this result.
Regarding the atrial fibrillation, your coumadin was temporarily held for evaluation of GI bleed and you will need your INR checked by the VNA service regularly to ensure it remains within a therapeutic range.
