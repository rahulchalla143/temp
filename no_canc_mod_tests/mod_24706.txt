History of Present Illness: 25 y/o M w/ history of hyperlipidemia and obesity, with the diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, as determined by wedge biopsy following a two-month workup for dyspnea.
He was admitted to an outside hospital in [**Month (only) 404**], where CT revealed bilateral infiltrates.
He eventually underwent lung biospy, which was c/w pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
He was admitted for CT and possible bronch.
Studies of the BAL were negative for infection.
His ETT was changed from a double lumen to single lumen, with position confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
Post CXR revealed no pneumothorax but significant left-sided pulmonary edema.
Blood cultures are still pending.
A CXR on [**4-12**] revealed unchanged minimal bibasilar opacities, with no evidence of new opacities.

Outside hospital CT reportedly show bilateral ground-glass opacity, predominating in the lower lobes.
COMPARISON: The outside hospital chest study was not available at the time of interpretation of the current study.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to the lung bases without IV contrast.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained in standard 5 mm and 1.25 mm thin slices for evaluation.
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: The lungs are symmetrically expanded.
Non-IV contrast limits full evaluation of the great mediastinal vessels, but vascular variant is noted, including a right-sided aortic arch and a right-sided descending aorta.
The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis, but no gross abnormality is noted.
Right hilar lymphadenopathy, could be reactive to the underlying disease.
CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  [**2162-4-7**]: Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior chest CT obtained on [**2162-4-6**].
The current study demonstrates interval increase in widespread parenchymal opacities bilaterally, right more than left, which might be due to the recent bronchopulmonary lavage.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable including the known right aortic arch.
[**2162-4-8**]: Resolution of right lung opacification with new severe diffuse opacification of the left lung and a left mainstem bronchial tube, which may represent a lavage tube.
About the time this radiograph was officially interpreted, a subsequent study 7:35 a.m. on [**4-10**] showed dramatic clearing of left upper lobe consolidation, an improvement in residual basilar involvement.
About 1 liter of normal saline was not retrieved from lung during left lung lavage and patient developed pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, likely representing interstitial diffusion of lavage fluid.
CXR c/w PNA.
You were satting 95% on room air (at rest) and remained afebrile.
