CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2199-2-12**] 4:20 AM .
TEE [**2-6**] A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
TTE [**2199-2-4**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-12-13**], trace aortic regurgitation and low normal left venticular systolic function are seen on the current study (c/w diffuse process - toxin, metabolic, etc.).
A PDA is not seen on review of the prior study nor on the current study.
Pt also had a thigh CT to investigate possibility of R thigh graft infection, which was negative.
A WBC scan showed a left upper lung pneumonia that we know about, and no evidence of vascular graft/stent infection, and no other site of infection .
A CT Chest questioned new infiltrates vs. worsening of ILD or PNA, and oxygen requirement increased to 4L.
# Necrotizing pneumonia: CXR on [**2199-1-31**] showed dense left upper lobe consolidation  consistent with known prior necrotizing pneumonia, loculated left pleural effusions due to the likely superimposed viral infection, and a left basilar atelectasis.
A DFA tests was positive for influenza B virus.
Pt transferred to rehab with picc, scheduled to finish her cefazolin on [**3-4**].
Pt is to get follow up CT in less than a month as listed in d/c instructions.
