Hepatitis C. 4.
Hepatitis C. 6.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 48-year-old male with HIV, a CD4 count of 600 in [**2111-10-19**], with a history of thrombocytopenia who complains of abdominal pain x 4 to 5 months which has worsened in the last several days.
Also admits to fevers and chills and complains of a rash over his trunk and leg with positive pruritus, headaches, nose bleeds, and gingival bleeding that he has noticed.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature of 100.6, pulse of 103, blood pressure of 123/76, respiratory rate of 20, pulse oximetry of 97% on room air.
Abdominal exam with generalized tenderness noted in the superior portion of the abdomen.
Rectal exam is guaiac negative, as per the emergency department resident, no masses noted.
Neuro exam reveals alert and oriented x 3.
Skin with diffuse raised white papules, pruritic, without drainage noted on the back of his legs bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Sodium of 135, potassium of 3.9, chloride of 104, bicarbonate of 25, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.4, glucose of 97.
ALT of 96, AST of 468, amylase of 41, alkaline phosphatase of 102, lipase of 33, total bilirubin of 3.0, albumin of 2.4.
White blood cell of 7.7, hematocrit of 29.5, platelets of 48.
UA showed some small blood and occasional bacteria.
Chest x-ray showed low volumes with segmented atelectasis in the right middle lobe.
Aggressive fluid resuscitation was used to maintain his blood pressure, and the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit.
The previously mentioned leg culture revealed later that the staph aureus that grew out was MRSA.
More history was gained from the ID consult as they had access to his records from his workup at an outside hospital.
His stool had been negative for C. diff, he had a negative EGD; and a CT at that time had shown a large gallbladder, hardened wall, and a diffuse collection around the pancreas.
The patient was transfused up to a hematocrit of 30, and an echo was ordered to assess for endocarditis.
On [**2112-2-17**] the patient underwent a TEE to evaluate for possible SBE.
The patient underwent a bone scan on [**2112-2-18**] which showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
For this, the patient's urine was tested and turned up positive only for opiates which he had been receiving for analgesia while in the hospital.
On [**2112-2-26**] cultures came back from his PICC line that were positive not only for MRSA but also VRE.
Interventional radiology attempted a lymph node aspiration which showed MRSA but was an inadequate sample to rule out lymphoma.
The patient remained stable and on current therapy until [**2112-3-2**] at which time he spiked to a temperature of 101.9.
The white blood cell count of the patient dropped from 7 to 2.1, and his platelets dropped from 39 to 22.
Hematocrit was 26.7.
UA was sent which was positive for yeast.
His Foley was discontinued, and the patient was started on Diflucan and levofloxacin empirically.
Blood cultures subsequently found gram-negative rods in his blood, and he failed his trial of void for which a Foley was re-placed with a 22 French coude catheter, and ceftazidime was added to the antibiotic regimen.
This action was in response to a spike to 104 on the night of [**3-2**] and a blood pressure drop at that time to 90/30.
On [**3-7**] the results of previous blood cultures came back positive for Enterobacter which was consistent with the urine culture earlier as well as a candidal positive culture from a swab taken in the OR from the right thigh.
The patient's blood pressure had been maintained postoperatively on propofol, Levophed, Pitressin; and maintaining his blood pressure became more of a problem on postoperative day [**6-22**] (which was [**2112-3-10**]).
His ABG showed increasing metabolic acidosis.
Hematocrit was noted to be down to 17.
