Stable chest x-ray exam  Renal U/S: [**10-5**] No evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
Increased resistive indices since prior exam in [**Month (only) 216**], correlate with renal function.
CT abdoman/ pelvis: [**10-5**] 1.
To evaluate for etiology, CXR and CT scan of abdomen was performed with no apparent abnormality besides stool impaction in the rectum.
Urinalysis did have minimal blood and white blood cells, but culture returned negative.
Stool cx returned positive for cdiff and patient was started on flagyl.
Blood cx from [**10-5**] grew pansensitive ecoli and antibiotics were subsequently narrowed to ciprofloxacin (and flagyl).
Surveillance blood cx from [**10-6**] were negative for 48 hrs, pt was continued on cipro/flagyl but developed leukopenia and flagyl was discontinued (bc can contribute to leukopenia) and changed to PO vancomycin.
She has outpt f/u in transplant clinic to have WBC count checked (in addition to INR and tacro levels, as below).
Baseline creatinine is in the 1s, but has been slowly increasing since [**Month (only) 205**] and has been as high as 2.7 in the recent past.
Etiology of developping renal insufficiency is unclear: CT scan with no evidence of obstruction, urinalysis without active sediment to suggest recurrent lupus nephritis.
A renal biopsy may be pursued as an outpatient.
Daily tacrolimus levels were also followed with level adjusted as needed.
Pt has f/u in renal transplant clinic to have tacro levels rechecked and to check WBC count, will modulate immunosuppression regimen based on those results.
Antiphospholipid syndrome:  on longterm anticoagulation with warfarin for history of APLS (Anticardiolipin Ab's showing elevated IgG and normal IgM in [**3-17**] and [**7-17**]) with multiple prior thrombotic occlusions of dialysis fistula.
INR at 2.9 to 2.1 on discharge (goal [**1-13**]).
Coumadin was restarted at 1mg daily with f/u day after discharge to check INR levels and to adjust coumadin accordingly.
Last [**Hospital1 18**] rheumatology clinic visit [**1-20**], documenting history of lupus nephritis and AVN of ankles  with last documented [**Doctor First Name **] positive 1:160 in [**2169**], though dsDNA Ab's have been negative when checked since [**2171**].
Hypertension: Pt has history of hypertension treated with metoprolol only, with past systolic blood pressure measurements documented in the 110-140 range, per OMR.
Hyperlipidemia: Last lipid panel in [**2172-9-10**], with TC 144, HDL 39, LDL 81, TG 120.
Osteoporosis: Last bone densitometry scan in [**2173-4-10**], consistent with osteoporosis, in setting of chronic glucocorticoid therapy and hyperparathyroidism.

Outpatient Lab Work Please have your INR checked at [**Hospital3 **] ([**Company 191**]) on Monday, [**10-11**].
Outpatient Lab Work Please have your tacrolimus level, CBC, and INR checked at renal transplant clinic on [**10-18**].
8. warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: please have your INR checked on [**10-11**].
We held your coumadin, but restarted it before your discharge, INR should be closely monitored when you leave the hospital.
We have made the following changes to your medications: Decrease your tacrolimus to 2mg twice a day Take cipro for 11 more days (last day = [**10-20**]) Take vancomycin for 25 more days (last day = [**11-3**]) Stop taking mycophenolate mofetil (cellcept) until you follow up with the kidney transplant doctors Continue to take coumadin 1mg daily, but have your INR checked at [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital3 **] on [**10-11**] to make sure it is therapeutic  Followup Instructions: The following appointments have been scheduled for you: .
