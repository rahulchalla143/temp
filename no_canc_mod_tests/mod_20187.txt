Admission Date:  [**2165-5-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2165-5-13**]   Service:  [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old man with history of coronary artery bypass graft, pacemaker, Type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who was recently admitted for acute cholangitis with failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography attempt and biliary drain placement who returns with acute renal failure and repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
At the time of that admission he had a creatinine of 5.5 which was likely due to dehydration.
His creatinine rose to 6.6 and at the time of transfer to [**Hospital6 256**] it was 5.5.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
During that procedure, he became hypoxic with oxygen saturation dropping into the 70s and was intubated at the time of the procedure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.9, heart rate 120, blood pressure 182/74, respirations 30, sating 100% on ventilatory support.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and extraocular movements intact.
Pulmonary revealed clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Chest x-ray had a question of left lower lobe infiltrate versus atelectasis but chronic in appearance since [**4-16**].
Electrocardiogram revealed a paced rhythm at 120 beats/minute.
Laboratory values on admission revealed white count 15.1, hematocrit 39, platelets 230.
Chem-7 with sodium 139, potassium 5.5, chloride 110, bicarbonate 15, BUN 70, creatinine 5.6.
AST was 30, ALT 31, LDH 272, CK 42, alkaline phosphatase 218, total bilirubin 1.4, amylase 78, lipase 51, albumin 3.2.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on this admission showed a nonbleeding 2 cm ulcer in the anterior bulb of the duodenum and also revealed an ulcerated major papilla.
The patient's liver function tests remained stable post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Given the patient's recent history of antibiotics the patient's stool was checked for Clostridium difficile and culture samples were negative at the time of discharge.
The patient's baseline creatinine was 0.8.
The patient's urine sediment and laboratory data were consistent with components of dehydration as well as likely acute tubular necrosis.
The patient's creatinine was improving significantly at the time of discharge, however, this should be monitored carefully as an outpatient to ensure resolution of his acute renal failure.
The patient's dysarthria was likely secondary to dry mouth post intubation and confusion possibly secondary to a recent infection and sedation.
The patient did have a head computerized tomography scan to rule out bleed which revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and Hydrochlorothiazide were held given his renal failure.
Pump - The patient had an echocardiogram on this admission given the aggressive hydration due to dehydration and echocardiogram revealed left atrial and left ventricular dilation and ejection fraction of 30%.
It also revealed global left ventricular hypokinesis, 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Care was given with giving the patient's fluids and his oxygen saturations remained stable.
Blood pressure - Patient with hypertension, and his Hydrochlorothiazide and [**Last Name (un) **] had been held during this admission.
The patient was continued on the beta blocker and in addition to this was given Hydralazine for blood pressure control.
Hydralazine was keeping the blood pressure within good control, however, will consider switching as an outpatient for more convenient dosing as the patient's renal function improves.
In addition, the patient did have guaiac positive stools and evidence of a duodenal ulcer, given that the patient's hematocrit dropped below 30 during this admission and had a history of coronary artery disease, he was transfused 1 unit.
Right upper extremity swelling - The patient had right upper extremity swelling on admission and ultrasound showed superficial clot in the brachial and basilic vein.
This was due to malnutrition, as the patient responded well to Vitamin K.  The patient was given Vitamin K during this admission and the INR returned to 1.3 at the time of discharge.
The patient's hematocrit although decreased during this admission likely due to hydration did not represent or suggest acute active blood loss.
for ulcer, he also had Helicobacter pylori checked which was negative.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Patient with significant malnutrition at the time of admission and low albumin as well as evidence of Vitamin K deficiency as represented by his increased INR.
