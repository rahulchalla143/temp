Admission Date:  [**2185-8-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-8-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2107-10-29**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital 212**] MEDICAL SERVICE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old lady, with a history of Crohn's disease, transferred from an outside hospital for work-up and treatment of severe GI bleed following colonoscopy.
Hematocrit on admission was 34.
Biopsy of other random sites was also taken, as well as a less than 1 cm polyp which was also removed.
Following the procedure, the patient developed hypotension, decreased hematocrit, and an increased INR.
Emergent colonoscopy showed old blood, but no active hemorrhage.
This study did not reveal a source of bleeding.
An EGD was performed which was also negative.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for further evaluation.
Upon arrival, she was emergently taken to the Angio Suite where she underwent embolization of the third branch of the superior mesenteric artery.
Her last admission to the hospital for Crohn's was in [**2185-4-26**] for a Crohn's flare for which she was treated with steroids;  2) Status post right hemicolectomy;  3) Status post anteriorly.
Cardiac exam revealed LOA.
Echo prior to current admission was within normal limits.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ARRIVAL TO MICU:  Revealed a temperature of 97.3, pulse 124, blood pressure 143/75, 98% O2 saturation.
Her pulmonary exam was clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.
Her cardiac examination revealed tachycardia without any murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Abdominal exam was notable for multiple abdominal scars.
Her extremity exam revealed no edema.
LABORATORY:  Laboratory values were notable for a hematocrit of 26.6 which was down from 37.2 the day prior to arrival here at [**Hospital1 18**].
The remainder of her serum electrolytes were within normal limits except for a calcium of 7.1.
Arterial blood gases revealed a pH of 7.1, PCO2 56, PO2 112.
Blood coagulation studies were notable for a PT of 13, INR 1.4, PTT 30.
EKG dated [**8-9**] from the outside hospital was notable for T wave inversions in leads III and AVF.
Chest x-ray was notable for left lower collapse and consolidation and small bilateral pleural effusions.
1) LOWER GI BLEED:  The patient had a massive lower GI bleed following colonoscopy and biopsy of various lesions within her colon.
Her hematocrit stabilized to the lower 30s upon transferring to the medical floor.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 25%.
This was different from her previous echocardiogram prior to her admission which was within normal limits.
Over the course of her ICU stay, she developed chest x-ray findings consistent with heart failure, as well as clinical exam findings which included elevated jugular venous pressure, lower extremity edema, and bilateral dullness to percussion at the lung bases.
Furthermore, as each day passed, her clinical exam findings improved.
A bedside swallowing study revealed aspiration of thin and nectar-like liquids.
ENT consultation revealed right vocal cord paresis with unclear etiology.
A head and neck CT was performed to rule out any stroke or mass compressing the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
A few days after her transfer to the floor from the ICU, the patient underwent a video swallowing study which revealed, again, aspiration of thin liquids and nectar-like fluids.
Following the procedure, there was a small amount of bright blood refluxing from the nasogastric tube which cleared several hours later.
During her course on the floor, her sodium came back down to within normal limits.
With fluid resuscitation, her creatinine came back down to within normal limits.
8) MCA ANEURYSM:  When the patient had undergone a head CT for evaluation of her vocal cord paresis, an MCA aneurysm was incidentally found.
The patient underwent angiogram to better image the lesion which was followed by a CT angiogram.
While in the Medical ICU, laboratory tests revealed an elevation of her troponin levels to a maximum of 0.44, evidenced when she arrived to the floor she was given a Persantine MIBI test to evaluate for any ischemic myocardium.
