According to her husband, ~1 week ago the patient was complaining of a headache, as well as the sensation that she had 'funny lines' in her left eye.
The vision changes and headache improved, and later that week she had a routine physical, which reportedly showed a 'normal' blood pressure, and no other abnormalities.
She was initially taken to an OSH, where she had a NCHCT which showed a large (5x5x7cm) right temporal lobe hemorrhage, at which time she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
No palpable pulse Pupils fixed an dilated, no corneal reflex  Pertinent Results: [**2102-9-4**] 03:36AM   GLUCOSE-164* UREA N-18 CREAT-0.6 SODIUM-139 POTASSIUM-3.5 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-13 [**2102-9-4**] 03:36AM   CK-MB-4 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2102-9-4**] 03:36AM   WBC-11.8* RBC-4.04* HGB-13.1 HCT-37.2 MCV-92 MCH-32.4* MCHC-35.1* RDW-13.3 [**2102-9-4**] 03:36AM   PLT COUNT-196  NCHCT FINDINGS: Again noted is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the right parietal, frontal and temporal lobes.
MRI imaging revealed no evidence of mass leading to likely etiology of amyloid angiopathy.
MRI showed early to late subacute blood indicating that bleed may have started days prior to presentation.
Repeat CT on [**9-5**] showed no new blood and no increase in midline shift.
Blood pressure was stable and between 120-150 systolic on home dose of Verapamil.
On the neuro-floor the patietns blood pressure was not controlled and verapamil was increased.
