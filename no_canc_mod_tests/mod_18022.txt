CT head/C-spine WNL  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 71216**] was hemodynamically stable, without large free fluid in abdomen, so decision was made to manage her kidney laceration non-operatively.
Initial CT revealed Grade III laceration of upper pole of the right kidney with evidence of active contrast extravasation.
A subsequent cystogram showed Grade III laceration of upper pole of the right kidney with evidence of active contrast extravasation.
A repeat CT scan on [**12-27**] revealed: shattered appearance of the right kidney, with a contained area of enhancement in the region of previously seen contrast extravasation in the upper pole.
On [**12-28**] the patient was taken to IR where an aortogram and right renal angiogram demonstrated arterial upper pole caliceal communication with active extravasation of contrast.
After the procedure the patient developed some vomiting on PPD 1, which resolved.
A KUB was within normal limits.
Her HCT remained stable and her foley was continued.
Her urine remained clear, and her foley was d/c'd on [**12-30**].
Continue to monitor your urine carefully.
