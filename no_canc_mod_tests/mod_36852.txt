Found to have prolonged pauses >10 sec on ECG at OSH.
The morning of admission she had a near syncopal episode and ECG revealed a [**9-8**] sec sinus pause.
While in the ICU, she had a second 10sec pause and SBP 70/52 from which she recovered spontaneously.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
SBP 140, HR 36, and >10 sec pause noted on telemetry.
The patient spontaneously awoke with HR 120's and atropine held.
ABG on 100% NRB was 7.39/44/456.
HR increased to 160's but SBP declined to 50's.
HR was persistantly in 160's and dopa weaned off in favor of neo gtt with HR decrease to 90-100's and SBP increase to 90's.
Stat echo revealed preserved EF and normal LV wall motion.
Briefly started on BiPAP but weaned to 50% VM following repeat ABG 7.36/42/150.
Presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) **] for evaluation however no source detected.
During this admission, she had an NSTEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath [**2140-9-30**] which revealed non-obstructing 2v disease and therefore no intervention was performed.

ECG ([**10-6**]): AF, 93 bpm, deep TWI I/II/AVl/V2-V6 (similar to prior) .
CXR ([**10-6**]): 1.
TTE ([**10-6**]): Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated.
Linear echodensity on the outside of the visceral pericardium likely represents a fat pad, however layered intrapericardial thrombus cannot be fully excluded, and thus a follow-up study is recommended in 24 hours.

Cath ([**2140-9-30**]): COMMENTS: 1.
Central aortic pressure was normal 128/62 with a mean of 87 (all mmHg).
Flow wire interrogation of the first diagonal as well as the  proximal left circumflex revealed fractional flow reserves post  adenosine infusion of .87 and .97, respectively.
During temp wire placement the patient became hypotensive with SBP 50's.
Her SBP increased to 80's and she was responsive only to painful stimuli with labored respirations of unclear etiology (thought to be [**12-31**] CVA vs. medications vs. hypotension).
However, at approximately 3:30am on [**2140-10-7**], the patient spontaneously awoke with increase in SBP to 120's and was A&Ox3 with no focal complaints.
