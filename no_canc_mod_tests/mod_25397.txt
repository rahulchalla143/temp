During the admission, an echocardiogram was performed, demonstrating worsening systolic function (EF 15-20%), but she was felt to be intravascularly dry, so her Lasix was held.
She had acute on chronic renal failure which returned to close to baseline (1.5) with IV fluids; she had a renal biopsy during that admission, the results of which are still pending.
She denies any history of blood clot (but had IUFD at 21wks recently).
In the ED, triage vitals were T97.6F, HR 124, BP 126/109, RR 18, Sat 100%.
Her respiratory rate was noted to be as high as 33.
Past Medical History: - SLE: diagnosed in [**2168**], manifested by kidney disease (membranous nephropathy by report of biopsy), facial rash, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis - Gastritis - Restrictive lung disease: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], noted to be moderate to severe on PFTs completed 5/[**2179**].
- History of pancytopenia associated with varicella zoster infection - History of persistent thrombocytopenia - Baseline proteinuria (Cr 0.8-0.9 pre-pregnancy) - Intrauterine fetal demise [**7-/2180**] (at gestational age ~21wks) - Right- and left-sided cardiomyopathy (EF estimated 15-20% in [**9-/2180**])   Social History: Patient is a computer programer in [**Location (un) 745**] and married.

ECG [**10-15**]: Sinus tachycardia.
TWF in I, II, V5-V6 (interpreted as pseudonormalization in ED, but unimpressive).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-7-24**], the LV cavity size has increased and the LVEF is slightly lower (LVEF OVERestimated on prior study).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 33 %.
[**Year (4 digits) **] [**2180-11-6**] Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2180-11-9**] Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-11-6**], left ventricular cavity size is smaller, global systolic function is improved (quantitative biplane LVEF 30% on review of prior study), and the severity of mitral regurgitation and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are reduced.
#) Cardiomyopathy: Pt was initially admitted to the hospitalist service but transferred for cath and endocardial biopsy in the setting of worsening EF.
Peripartum cardiomyopathy was also considered however given the timing of onset and biopsy showing immune complexes seen on endocardial biopsy, lupus cardiomyopathy was thought to be more likely.
She was treated with steroids, cytoxan, plasmaphoresis, IVIG and supportive care, and improved from an EF of 15 to 33%.
Received solumedrol 1g daily x 3 followed by solumedrol 30mg IV q12hrs, which was uptitrated to 60 q 12 hrs and subseuquently tapered and she was ultimately discharged on prednisone 60mg orally daily.
She had repeat biopsy showing type 3,4,5 lupus nephritis.
Urine lytes indicative of prerenal ischemia (FeUrea < 0.02%) +/- evolving ATN  likely from poor cardiac output/ cardiorenal syndrome.
While her renal function showed some initial worsening with diuresis, diuresis was continued due to continued volume overload, and creatinine remained stable.
Blood pressures stable .
