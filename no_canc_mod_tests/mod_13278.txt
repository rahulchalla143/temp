CXR at the time showed bibasilar consolidations and TTE revealed a slightly depressed EF (45%) and elevated PA pressures.
The patient did well until [**8-2**], when he went for follow-up to the pulmonologist, where he had a CXR revealing pulmonary edema with similar symptoms of shortness of breath and hypoxia and was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for CHF exacerbation (BNP 6141, Trop 0.055).
On [**8-6**] he had 2 episodes of cardiac pauses (10s at 10:30am, 24s at 4:30pm).
BP remained stable during these episodes.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
On transfer from [**Location (un) 620**]-- SBP 110s, HR 80s, afib with PVCs and no pauses, 100% on 2L.
PE CT showed non-oclusive pulmonary emboli bilaterally in the upper lobe arteries.
He was discharged on Coumadin 5mg Daily with INR goal of [**3-5**].

CXR [**2101-8-6**]:  Calcified pleural plaques consistent with previous asbestos exposure.
CXR [**2101-8-9**]:  Confirms placement of a pacemaker with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
ECHO [**2101-8-8**]:  Sym LVH, nml LV cavity size, global LV hypokinesis with LVEF of 35%.
Moderate AS with peak velocity of 3.0, peak gradient of 36mmHg.
Head CT [**2101-8-9**].
Video Swallowing Study [**2101-8-11**]-Showed mild dysphagia and aspiration on thin liquids corrected by compensatory maneurves such as chin tuck.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 57277**] is [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a history of DVT/PE on coumadin, A-Fib/aflutter, CHF with an EF of 45% who presents with a CHF exacerbation and extensive cardiac pauses during sleep.
Asystolic Pauses/Rhythm-On admission, the patient was found to be in A-fib with episodes of bradycardia and sinus pauses (lasting up to 20-30 seconds.)
The pacemaker was interrogated on [**2101-8-9**] and PA and lateral chest x-rays confirmed the pacemaker placement.
However, on this hospitalization, the Left ventricular ejection fraction was found to be 35%, with global left ventricular hypokinesis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and Aortic stenosis.
The patient's heart rate was controlled with metoprolol in the hopes that a slower heart rate would allow more effective filling of the ventricles.
His INR was 2.4 on admission.
The patient was given 2 units of fresh frozen plasma to correct his INR to below 1.8.
On discharge, the patient was on coumadin 5mg a day with Lovenox 80mg SC with an INR of 1.6.
When the patient reaches a therapeutic INR of [**3-5**] for 48 hours, the patient should discontinue Lovenox and continue on coumadin mg PO daily.
A head CT was obtained that showed no acute intracranial process.
An ABG was also obtained that showed adequate oxygenation and electrolytes were normal.
Pulmonary Nodule-With resolution of the pulmonary edema, a pulmonary nodule in the Right upper lobe of the lung was found on chest x-ray on [**2101-8-9**].
Difficulty Swallowing:  On [**2101-8-10**], the patient underwent a swallowing evaluation that showed aspiration.
The patient was scheduled for a video swallow study that was performed on [**2101-8-11**] and showed mild dysphagia for thin fluids that could be corrected with compensatory maneuvers.
It was felt that the patient could continue on a regular diet as long as compensatory maneuvers such as a chin tuck were performed during feeding.
C.diff-Patient was found to be C.diff positive by stool cultures on [**2101-8-10**].
The patient was placed on a bowel regimen, cardiac diet, and is full code.
Coumadin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Please adjust accordingly for a goal INR [**3-5**].
