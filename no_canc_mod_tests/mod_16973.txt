When she arrived at the hospital, vital signs were pulse of 80, blood pressure 120/80, respiratory rate 18, pulse oximetry 100%.
EKG at this time showed a QRS complex equal to 0.106.
QTC was 0.45.
Post intubation, the systolic blood pressure dropped to the 60s.
The patient also had a head CT, which was negative.
Further laboratory data revealed an arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.29, pCO2 15, pAO2 65.
The patient was found to have an anion gap of 23.
Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine and tricyclics, however, negative for alcohol.
At this time the liver function tests, as well as the PT/INR and glucose were all within normal limits.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department, here, the patient was found to have a pulse of 80, blood pressure of 85/33.
She was treated with three ampules of bicarbonate that were pushed sequentially without any change in the QRS interval after an EKG had shown a wide QRS complex at 0.116.
Chest x-ray at this time was negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: Temperature 96.4, pulse 89, blood pressure 101/42 on a dopamine drip at 10 and respiratory rate 14 on control ventilation.
Vent settings at that time included assist-control ventilation with tidal volume 600, respiratory rate 20, FIO2 of 60% with PEEP of 5.
HEENT:  Examination revealed pupils, which are 5 mm and sluggishly reactive and equal.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
EXTREMITIES:  2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, no edema, no cyanosis, axillary sweat present.
LABORATORY DATA:  Data revealed the following:  Arterial blood gases pH 7.44, pCO2 37, PO2 226 on FIO2 of 60%.
White blood cell count 16.5, hematocrit 36.8, platelet count 278,000, PT 13.7, INR 1.3, PTT 25.4, sodium 146, potassium 2.8, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 12, creatinine 1.7, glucose 135, anion gap of 19, calcium 8.7, magnesium 1.6, phosphatase 0.8.
Urinalysis revealed specific gravity of 1.002, negative nitrite, negative leukocyte esterase, no glucose, no ketones, and 30 protein.
Serum toxicology screen reveals Tylenol level of 123, aspirin level of 12, which is subtherapeutic, no tricyclic antidepressants, no alcohol, no barbiturates, and no benzodiazepines.
Urine toxicology screen is positive for cocaine, but negative for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, amphetamines, and methadone.
The EKG changes, QRS, as well as prolonged QT resolved.
The electrolytes including calcium, magnesium, and potassium were repleted aggressively.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Given presentation with hypotension of unclear etiology, the patient was worked up with blood and urine cultures, both of which showed no growth.
Chest x-ray remained clear with no evidence of aspiration pneumonia and the patient did not receive any antibiotics.
Upon discharge, the patient's sodium level was 140.
GI:  Given the concern of abnormal liver function tests subsequent to Tylenol overdose, the patient's LFTs, INR, and glucose were followed.
