HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year old female with known diabetes, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease who presents for pre-hydration for an arteriogram of her right lower extremity.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS: Temperature of 98.7, pulse of 92, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure of 110/60, O2 saturation of 95% on room air.
PULSE EXAM: Shows palpable carotid's/radial's bilaterally 2+, femoral's are palpable 1+, popliteal's are monophasic dopplerable signal bilaterally.
On the left, DP is monophasic and the PT is a triphasic dopplerable signal.
IV hydration was begun in anticipation for an arteriogram with a creatinine of 1.5.
Admitting labs included a white count of 8.4, hematocrit of 34.0, BUN of 15, creatinine of 1.5.
An EKG showed atrial fibrillation.
A chest x-ray revealed poor pulmonary inspiratory effort.
This was discussed with the patient, and she was allowed to eat and was prepared for an arteriogram for [**2123-9-23**].
On [**9-23**], the patient underwent abdominal aortogram with bilateral runoff and a right above-the-knee amputation.
The angio was done from the left common femoral with a 5 sheath, and she had a dopplerable DP at the end of the procedure.
Postoperative hematocrit was 31.2.
A chest x-ray was without pneumothorax.
Her enzymes were cycled, which were negative for rule out.
Her rate was under excellent control with atrial fibrillation of 78.
Blood pressures were 100/94.
Blood gas was 7.43/43/111/29 and 3.
Her IV fluid rate was decreased, and the patient was transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care.
Her hematocrit remained stable at 30.4 with a white count of 13.1; down from 15.0.
Her creatinine improved - was 0.7 - and gases remained stable.
Her white count was 9.9.
The patient's INR's should be monitored; and her goal INR should be 2.0 to 3.0 and Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly.
