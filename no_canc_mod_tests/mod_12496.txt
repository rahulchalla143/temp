Pt presented to ED via EMS with O2 sats to 80's% on RA, which increased to 90's on 100%NRB, with CXR showing moderate CHF.

Echo revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy with LVEF of 50-55%.
After determining that she has not fallen in four years, pt was anticoagulated with coumadin using a heparin bridge, with an INR goal of 2.0.
She went back into Afib and could not be rate controlled by lopressor x3 and BP not responsive to fluid.
CXR could not exclude left basilar infiltrate and she was then started on levoflxacin and flagyl.
5.Acute renal failure: Pt presented with a creatinine of 1.3 which improved during hospitalization.
8.Type II Diabetes: Pt's blood sugars were initially controlled with an insulin sliding scale given her rash to each Metformin and Glyburide.
