DES in LM in [**2118**], Ischemic CMP with EF of 20-25% and PPM/ICD in [**2116**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, CKD with baseline creatinine 1.6-2.0, hypertension, presenting from home with acute onset SOB.
On EMS arrival, she was hypoxic into the high 80s, placed on a non-rebreather, and nitro-paste, then BiPAP and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 74 140/69 30 99% on BiPAP.
ECG showed a-pacing, old RBBB, c/w prior.
CXR was consistent with volume overload, with a possible increased opacity in the RLL.
She had 300 cc in urine output, and improved and looked better on the non-rebreather.
On transfer to the unit, she was comfortable, vitals 97.6, 60, 113/50, 20, 99 on Venti mask @ 50%.
Also of note, her INR yesterday was 3.3 and she was told to hold her coumadin.

CXR Portable [**2124-10-20**]: IMPRESSION: Numerous limitations as above.
Renal U/S [**2124-10-20**]: The right kidney is atrophic, measuring 8.7 cm, with an echogenic cortex and mild hydronephrosis.
There is a 1.2 cm calculus within the right renal pelvis, similar to that seen on the prior CT examination.
Previously noted hyperdense lesions on the prior CT within the left kidney are not clearly noted on the current ultrasound.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC CHF EXACERBATION: TTE in [**4-/2124**] showed EF 15-20%.
There is substantial evidence to support pulmonary edema secondary to CHF exacerbation, including history of drinking more fluid recently, bilateral rales on exam, and chest x-ray findings.
She was ruled for for MI as an underlying cause.
She was transferred to the floor and continued to improve on PO torsemide 10mg satting in the mid-high 90's on RA.
She already has an ICD but given that her QRS is 170ms and EF is low, she would also potentially benefit from biventricular pacing.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY: Her baseline creatinine is 1.5 as of [**4-/2124**], was 2.3 in [**7-/2124**], 2.5 on admission.
FEurea 47%, indicative of an intrinsic renal process.
Given that her renal function has remained stable she was re-started on her [**Last Name (un) **] but digoxin was held at discharge for possible re-initiation by her outpt cardiologist.
She was monitored on telemetry and continued on her home warfarin dose with INR goal of [**2-3**], and also continued on her home dose of amiodarone.
# HLD: Last lipid panel in [**2-/2124**] showed LDL 126, HDL 67.
Lipid panel in-house showed total cholesterol of 170, LDL of 88, and HDL of 45.
2) [**Hospital1 **]-Ventricular Pacing: She has a mildly widened QRS of 170ms and lowish EF of 15-20% and may benefit from biventricular pacing.
This would best be discussed with her outpatient cardiologist 3) Follow-up final blood culture results: She had blood cultures pending at the time of discharge.
The final results of these cultures should be followed by her PCP.
4) She will have home VNA services who will draw chemistries and coags and fax the results to her PCP for evaluation of lytes, renal function, and warfarin and adjustements/management as needed.
When you initially came to the hospital, your kidney function was also not doing so well, but it improved as we took off all that excess fluid off.
We made the following changes to your medications: START Spironolactone 25 mg daily STOP Digoxin 125 mcg every other day CONTINUE Aspirin 81 mg daily  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
