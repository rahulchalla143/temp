CT Torso ([**2159-9-2**]): 1.
Echo [**2159-9-3**]: The left and right atrium are moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-6-12**],the findings are similar.
Echo [**2159-9-4**]: The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Spontaneous echo contrast is noted in the left heart consistent with slow flow.

1 CHF: Severe systolic CHF with EF <20% with moderate MR, hypotension likely secondary to poor cardiac output.
Central line was placed, and he was started on dobutamine drip tailored therapy at 15/kg/min on [**2159-9-4**] which was gradually weaned to 12mcg/kg/min on [**2159-9-6**], and weaned completely on [**2159-9-7**] and his central line was pulled on the same day.
CT torso initially was unrevealing.
We followed his daily LFTs, which continued to be mildly elevated but stable c/w with liver congestion from his heart failure.
Hem/Onc was consulted, but was difficult to send hypercoagulable stuides given patient already anticoagulated; we sent antiphospholipid Ab which was WNL, pt didn't carry the more common factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**] mutation and Prothrombin mutations, homocysteine levels was WNL;  His initially INR was supratherapeutic 4.0->3.5, coumadin was held initially; coumadin was restarted at 3mg PO qhs when INR came down to 2.5.

hx of hypercoagulable state, he was also started on Lovenox 60mg SC q12h when INR became undertherapeutic (INR<2.0) while on Coumadin.
Noted on CT torso, new finding which was concerning for thromboembolic disease, possibly LV thrombus give dilated CMP predisposing to intracardiac stasis.

No clots seen on echo however.

You are on coumadin (indefinitely) and lovenox( for three days only), blood thinners.
It is very important that you take coumadin everynight, please have your INR checked regularly by your PCP to keep it within the therapeutic range (goal INR [**3-2**]) to prevent clots development in your heart which can cause stroke and other serious problems.
