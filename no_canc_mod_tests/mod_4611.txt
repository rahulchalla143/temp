3. diffuse SB thickening (beginning in prox jejunum) as well as distal colonic wall thickening - near target sign - no signif bowel dilation- target sign suggests acute inflammation or ischemia - vessels appear patent - no free fluid in abd/pelvis may relfect enteroclitis.
CT Head w/o contrast: No acute process.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # Hypotension/shock: Most likely septic shock given the high white count of 30.5 on admission, from GI source (infectious enterocolitis +/- ischemic colitis) vs Pulmonary (aspiration, HCAP, necrotizing PNA) vs Urinary (cystitis seen on CT but unremarkable U/A).
Echo did not show evidence of cardiogenic component.
CT abdomen revealed diffuse small bowel and distal colon thickening concerning for infection or ischemia due to low flow state.
Hct was noted to fall from 48 to 33 within 2 days, and though this drop was partially attributable to hemodilution, his stool did begin to have visible blood (guaiac pos).
They recommended continuing IV cefepime and flagyl for a 8 day course (day 1 [**8-17**]), and PO vancomycin was DC'd after c diff cultures were negative.
His hematochezia had stopped and hematocrit was stable on the day of discharge, no signs of hemodynamic compromise.
If there is interest in further workup, GI suggested it would be reasonable to repeat CT scan in [**1-10**] weeks to determine if there is persistent small bowel thickening, in which case endoscopy could be considered.
CT chest shows area of consolidation in LLL concerning for necrotizing PNA vs aspiration, so he was started on vancomycin cefepime.
CT head w/o contrast negative for acute process.
Cr returned to [**Location 213**] of 0.9 after aggressive fluid repletion.
Venous duplex ultrasound showed no clot.
# Aortic Stenosis: Unknown severity at the time of admission, so echo was obtained and showed mild stenosis.
TRANSFER OF CARE ISSUES: - Abx:  continue IV vanco, cefepime and flagyl until [**8-25**] - GI bleed/diarrhea:  if further work of hematochezia/diarrhea is desired, consider repeat CT scan of abdomen in [**1-10**] weeks to ensure resolution - Aspiration/secretions:  monitor swallowing ability and advance diet as tolerated.
In the meantime, continue tubefeeds w Fibersource HN w goal rate 60ml/hr - RUE swelling:  Venous duplex ultrasound showed no clot.
Keep elevated and monitor - Aspirin: held in setting of GI bleeding, can restart in 1 week ([**8-28**])  Medications on Admission: ASA 81mg Daily Omeprazole 20mg PO Daily Senna PO Daily Sinemet 25/100mg half tablet TID Lisinopril 2.5mg PO Daily Ergocalciferol 50,000units Q3weeks Tramadol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] plus Q4h PRN Tylenol 650mg PO Q6h PRN Dulcolax Suppository 10mg Daily PRN   Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
You were brought to the emergency department and your blood pressure was very low and your abdomen was causing you a lot of pain.
You had a CT scan of your abdomen which was concerning for inflammation of parts of your bowels.
We thought that it was a from of infection nad not even blood flow, so you were given antibiotics and fluids to help your blood flow.
Over time, your blood pressure normalized and the breathing tube was removed so that you could breath on your own.
After that happened, you slowly got better while here, as we monitored the levels of your blood.
Your blood levels were stable, so you were ultimately returned back to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
