He checked her oxygen saturation and found her to be 92-93% on 2L NC, but over the next few hours continued to be somnolent and with progressively worsening hypoxia to the low 80s on 2L NC and still less than 90% on 4L NC, so she was brought in to the ED.
He found her temperature to be 99F.

A right IJ CVL was placed in the ED and the patient's pressures did not respond sufficiently to aggressive fluid resuscitation.
On admission to the MICU unit, a Levophed drip was started, more NS was administered and her MAP and CVP responded.
Additionally, the pt's O2 sats dropped to the mid 80's and ABG's were performed which showed CO2 retention.
Right lower lung exam and CXR findings concerning for pneumonia.
Per recent chest CT, the patient also had some atelectasis and mucoid impaction which likely contributed to her presenting hypoxia.
Broad spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin and zosyn, were initiated to treat hospital acquired pneumona.
On [**2148-7-29**], Zosyn was discontinued as cultures were vancomycin sensitive.
The patient was given 10mg IV lasix on [**7-30**] and [**2148-7-31**] to diurese the patient after CXR demonstrated evidence of fluid overload.
had oxygen saturations persistently in the low 90's.
Sputum cultures were MRSA positive, and the pt.
The following day, the pt's blood pressure dropped and she experienced aother episode of hypoxia (as outlined above).
An ABG taken on [**7-27**]/201 showed CO2 of 56 suggesting carbon dioxide retention and mental status changes secondary to hypercarbia.
Addendum: Pt has been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] with her mental status, and has been fluctuating in her ability to maintian oxygen saturations in the 90-92 range, dipping as far as 80%.
While no urinary cultures were positive, Meropenem treatment was initiated on [**2148-7-31**] as the patient's mental status had some-what worsened despite treatment for pneumonia.
