LAD was 100% occluded at the mid level, filled by LIMA.
Lcx 100% occluded in OM1, OM2 had diffuse 80% proximal disease.
Left vetriculography demonstrated mild anterolateral and inferior hypokinesis with contrast estimated EF of 60%.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal left sided filling pressure of mRA 9mmHg.
There was wide aortic pulse pressure (40 mmHg) with marked elevation of LVEDP (36 mmHg) to near aortic diastolic level (40 mmHg), consistent with severe aortic insufficiency.
PCW pressure was elevated with a mean of 29 mmHg.
Fick calculated cardiac ouput and cardiac index were 4.8 l/min and 2.4 l/min/m2, respectively.
On [**8-4**] Cardiac Surgery was consulted and on [**2155-8-8**] patient underwent redo AVR/MVR with 21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical Aortic valve and 27mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical mitral valve.
Patient was extubated on POD1  and was transfused 1 U of PRBC's for a crit of 28.
On POD 2 pt had bouts of AFib where he was treated with lopressor and Amio bolus then amio po.
Pt did well on the floor, however, it took several days to make his INR therapeutic.
Pt was cleared by PT and his PCP was notified for INR checks.
