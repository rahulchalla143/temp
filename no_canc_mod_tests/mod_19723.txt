CTA Head ([**9-8**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
EEG ([**9-9**]): IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no clinical or electrographic seizures.
CXR ([**9-17**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
EEG ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the left frontal and hemispheric slowing including of the background.
CT Head ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
Physical exam on admission showed decreased arousal, left face and arm weakness, and decreased reflexes in the legs (previously documented).
LP showed 121 protein and 89 glucose with 2->4 WBC, fluid culture and HSV 1 and 2 were negative.
EEG [**Date range (1) 54183**] showed moderate to severe encephalopathy, but no evidence of seizure.
Her progressive MS was determined to be the most likely cause of her seizures, especially since the hyperintensities on MRI extended past the grey-white junction.
Secondary Progressive MS: MRI Head/MRA brain showed new demyelinating plaques in the right cerebellar hemisphere and brainstem.
It was determined that since the hyperintensities on MRI extended past the grey-white junction, this was likely the cause of her seizures.
CT Head showed no acute intracranial abnormality.
CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Repeat EEG showed left frontal and hemispheric slowing including of the background suggesting a focal subcortical dysfunction in the left hemisphere.
Urine culture did show Acinetobacter baumanni complex, so she was treated with Bactrim for a 10 day course.
Her Keppra, Topamax, and Amytriptyline were discontinued as these may have been contributing to her encephalopathy.
UTI: Urine culture on [**9-12**] showed no growth.
However, a UA and urine culture were rechecked on [**9-19**] for her persistent altered mental status, which showed UA: sm leuk, neg nitr, 18 WBC, few bact.
Urine culture grew Acinetobacter baumannii complex.
