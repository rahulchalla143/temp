FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates a left pleural effusion which has increased in size.
While this was not present on the most recent prior examination, enhancement seen on other prior studies and is most likely an area of recurrent atelectasis, however, a developing pneumonia cannot be excluded at this site.
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color doppler examination of the right jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins demonstrates normal compressibility, color flow, respiratory variation, and augmentation.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2155-10-24**] 11:37 AM  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: ABD PAIN Field of view: 36  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 83 year old F with ischemic left foot, severe PVD, CHF, DIC who initially complained of abdominal pain with elevated lactate, now stable for CT. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?PLEASE R/O MESENTERIC ISCHEMIANO IV CONTRAST PLEASE - ARF CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: acute renal failure  INDICATION: 83 year old with severe peripheral vascular disease, CHF, who initially complained of abdominal pain with elevated lactate.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis following the administration of oral contrast only.
Multiplanar reformatted images were also obtained.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen/pelvis of [**2155-9-19**].
CT OF ABDOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST: The imaged portions of the lung bases demonstrate an interval increase in the size of bilateral pleural effusions, now large on the right and moderate on the left.
The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are not significantly changed in appearance, allowing for the noncontrast aspect of this exam.
CT OF PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST: There is increased fatty stranding/fluid density within the presacral space.
Multiplanar reformatted images were helpful in confirming the above findings.
These images also show no secondary signs of acute mesenteric ischemia.
IMPRESSION: 1) Limited noncontrast exam of the abdomen.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2155-10-24**] 11:39 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: ?CVA ?cause of altered mental status  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 83 year old woman with ischemic left foot, CHF, DIC who has been having mental status changes, now stable for CT. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?CVA ?cause of altered mental status CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
COMPARISON: CT head [**2155-4-22**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the brain were obtained without IV contrast.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: There are multiple chronic lacunar infarcts, most prominent in the lentiform nuclei and internal capsules bilaterally.
Brief Hospital Course: [**2155-4-17**] - EF 55-60% mild symm LVH, RV mildly dilated, 1+ AR, 1+MR  Altered mental status had an initial unclear etiology.
Abdominal CT was neagtive.
Patient also was initially anuric and bladder scan indicated no urine in the bladder.
Renal us was negative for masses and hydronephrosis.
5 mL of urine was obtained and spinning the urine revealed questionable muddy brown casts.
(Cr: 1.9) Patient had elevated lactate (9.6), increased INR (3.4), low-normal fibrinogen, elevated white count (14), FDP- 80-160, D Dimer- 6569  and patient was thought to be in DIC.
Urine cultures grew E.Coli and patient was placed on ceftriaxone.
In addition, while in hospital, patients BP and HR were very elevated most likely secondary to foot pain.
