He denies CP, nausea, chest pressure, radiation, LE edema, orthopnea, or PND - but he wears a CPAP mask.
In our ED, initial VS were T 97.8, P 60, BP 110/71, RR 20, O2sat 99%.
He went into a perfusing VT at around 130/min with a BP of 101/72.
- Cardiomyopathy, EF 30% seen on echocardiogram in [**2107-5-10**].
NECK: JVP at 11cm CARDIAC: RR, tachy, normal S1, S2.

An additional lead terminates in the SVC, and is unchanged since the prior study.
CXR [**2110-12-31**] FINDINGS: A left ICD is seen with two leads in the right ventricle and one lead in the upper SVC.
EKG [**2110-12-30**]: Ventricular tachycardia with a fusion beat.
Compared to the previous tracing, ventricular tachycardia is new.
# RHYTHM: On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was in a perfusing ventricular tachycardia rhythm with BP 101/72 and rate in 130's.
On HD2 his rhythm alternated between slow, perfusing VT and sinus rhythm.
He was seen by electrophysiology who idenitifed the rhythm as re-entrant sinus tachycardia and performed an ablation when INR <2.
He will be continued on quinidine 486mg daily, which may interfere with metabolism of coumadin, requiring a lower dose to keep his INR within proper range.
# PUMP: Chronic congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction, EF 30%.
Outpatient Lab Work Please have INR checked on Monday [**1-5**] or Tuesday [**1-6**].
Please have your INR checked on Tuesday and follow up these results with your primary care physician.
