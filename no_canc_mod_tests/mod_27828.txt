He subsequently [**Known lastname 1834**] stress testing which showed 0.5mm inferolateral ST depression at peak exercise.
Nuclear imaging revealed a very small mild perfusion defect at the inferior base.
Cardiac catheterization on [**8-21**] showed severe three vessel disease and normal LV function.
Angiography showed an 80% mid LAD stenosis, proximal 80% lesion in the circumflex, and a chronically occluded right coronary artery.
LV gram showed no mitral regurgitation and an LVEF of 60%.
