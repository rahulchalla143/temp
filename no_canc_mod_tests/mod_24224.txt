Imaging: - CT chest/abdomen/pelvis [**2138-11-25**]: bibasilar atelectasis, no nodules, consolidations, or effusions in the lungs.
- CXR [**2138-11-26**]: AP chest compared to [**11-25**]: Interval widening of the upper mediastinum and left hilus suggests interval volume administration.
ECHO [**2138-11-26**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
He had an ECHO completed which did not reveal RV dilitation concerning for a PE and there was no evidence of endocarditis.
In the ED he had an extensive workup to rule out infection that might have been predisposing him to hypotension (although WBC was normal and he was afebrile), including a CT chest/abd/pelvis which did not reveal any nidus of infection.
He was given several liters of NS IVF, his BP improved and he was able to be weaned off of dopamine.
Blood cultures & urine cultures have been no growth to date.
Creatinine normalized with IV hydration.
GGT was normal indicating the source of alkaline phosphatase is likely not the biliary tree, instead may be coming from the bone or other sources.
You were given insulin and fluids and medication to keep your blood pressure sufficiently high through an IV and eventually all of your labs normalized and these medications were stopped.
