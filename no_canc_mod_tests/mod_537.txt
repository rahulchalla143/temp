Sources of infection included sacral decubitus ulcer (not extending to bone, draining, or tender/erythematous), L AKA stump (well-healed, though had history of VRE), R foot ulcer (tender to palpation, not draining), or pulmonary (given CXR and exam evidence for multifocal PNA and history of choking/cough while eating).
Initial blood cultures on [**2123-6-21**] were 1/2 bottles positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters and pairs (speciation revealed staph epi), felt to likely be contaminant.
Required several fluid boluses initially to maintain urine output, but was hemodynamically stable with good urine output throughout the remainder of his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course.
Cultures from tip of PICC line removed on [**6-21**] at nursing home revealed gram-negative rods, but NO blood cx were positive.
In addition, UA prior to d/c appeared c/w with UTI, cultures were pending upon d/c.
RPR and B12 were negative.
TSH was mildly elevated at 4.4.
Oxygen requirment remained stable [**Hospital 6028**] hospital course, with saturation 96-98% on 3.5 liters.
CXR on [**6-24**] had improving consolidations and decrease in bilateral pleural effusions as seen on CXR at admission.
Pt discharged with good oxygenation with plans to complete antibiotics course for his presumed pneumonia (Levofloxacin 500mg PO QD x 14 days through [**7-6**]).
Cardiovascular: Patient was ruled out for MI by 3 sets cardiac enzymes and placed on ASA, statin.
BNP was 1800; echocardiogram demonstrated EF 50% with evidence of increased LVEDP, pulmonary hypertension and 3+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was titrated up on captopril for afterload reduction, and switched to lisinopril on discharge.
Renal/FEN: Acute renal failure with creatinine 1.2 up from baseline 0.5.
Initial FeNa was 0.8% consistent with pre-renal etiology from dehydration [**1-13**] poor PO intake and infection versus CHF.
Urinalysis seemed + for UTI, culture pending at discharge.
Heme: Initial studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease (Fe low, TIBC low, Ferritin elevated), but difficult to interpret in setting of acute illness.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2732**] & Retirement Home - [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Community acquired pneumonia Mild CHF Acute on chronic renal failure  Secondary diagnoses: HTN PVD Hyperlipidemia Depression BPH R carotid stenosis, 80-99% (non-intervened) OA L BKA => AKA as noted above [**5-16**] Left hip arthroplasty x2 Bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy s/p SFA angioplasty with stent [**12-16**]   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, with HR in 80s-90s, BP 107/43, RR of 24 and O2 sats of 94% on RA.
