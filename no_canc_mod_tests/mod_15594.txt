She was given heparin, Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, sublingual nitroglycerin and patch and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] at around 7:00 for further management.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2135-12-14**] showed LMCA with distal 30%, left anterior descending coronary artery osteal 40% with diffuse disease and serial 70 to 80% stenosis in mid vessel and distal luminal irregularities.
Left circumflex showed diffuse tortuous disease with 90% serial stenosis around mid vessel.
Catheterization on [**5-7**] native three vessel disease and occluded graft.
At that time she had a wedge pressure of 6 and an LVEDP of 13.
ETT on [**2-7**] at outside hospital showed lateral fixed defect and anterolateral ischemia.
Mitral regurgitation 4+ shown on catheterization of [**5-7**] and 1+ AI.
Congestive heart failure with an EF of 40% in [**5-7**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature 97.3, heart rate 76, respiratory rate 12, blood pressure 106/47, saturation is 100% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
Pulmonary rales at left base and throughout bilateral lung field.
Reflexes 2+ patellar.
OUTSIDE HOSPITAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 16.2, hematocrit 44.1, platelets 323.
Chem panel sodium 142, potassium 4.6, chloride 105, bicarb 26, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, glucose 107.
[**Name (NI) 2591**], PT 12.1, PTT 30, INR 1.0.
Cardiac enzymes CPK 93, CKMB 8, CKMB 19, troponin T 0.288.
Electrocardiogram interpretation left axis deviation, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in 1, L, T waves in 3 and F, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V2 through V6, left atrial hypertrophy.
Echocardiogram in [**2135**], severe left ventricular dysfunction with EF of 25%, atrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation (4+ on cardiac catheterization).
Cardiac catheterization [**2135-12-14**], LMCA distal 30%.
Hemodynamics, RA 7, pulmonary capillary wedge 18, PA 42/21/29, aorta 135/57, cardiac output 2.51, cardiac index 1.73.
Cardiac catheterization [**2135-12-15**], LMCA distal 40%.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissections and 0% residual stenosis in the stents and a 1.5 to 2.0 mm diagonal with residual 90% stenosis mid vessel and 40% stenosis in the ostium.
Echocardiogram [**2135-12-15**] conclusions, left ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Indications for echocardiogram were evaluation for pericardial effusion.
Portal chest x-ray on [**2135-12-18**] indication, fever and pleuritic chest pain.
The morning after the cardiac catheterization the patient was complaining of chest pain 7 out of 10 across the shoulders.
Electrocardiogram showed worsening ST depressions in leads V3 and V4.
The patient had a TTE, which showed an ejection fraction of 25%.
Serial hematocrits after the second blood transfusion showed an appropriate increase of volume.
Chest x-ray was taken, which showed mild congestive heart failure with interstitial edema, superimposed upon a more chronic interstitial pattern, which has been previously treated with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
Blood cultures were also taken and have been negative to date, urine culture has been negative to date and urinalysis showed trace leukocytes, moderate blood, nitrates negative, red blood cell 0 to 2, white blood cell 0 to 2, bacteria none.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was placed on a cardiac diet, 2 gram sodium.
Electrolytes were checked q day and were repleted as needed.
