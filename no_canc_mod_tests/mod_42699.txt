Follow-up carotid ultrasound demonstrated 70-99% stenosis of the left ICA and 50-69% stenosis of the right ICA.
Per report, echo, ECG, and stress test were all relatively unremarkable.
His angiography demonstrated left carotid with 95% origin stenosis in the ICA that was crossed was predilated and stented, then post dilated with 5.0 balloon with 0% residual.
GERD-now resolved, pt feels was r/t folic acid 6.

Limited hemodynamics with initial central pressure of 133/80 with HR 61.
Imaging of the right carotid showed moderate non-flow limiting disease.
Imaging of the left carotid revealed an proximal left internal 95% stenosis with slow flow.
Final angiography with no residual and no complications.
Post intervention imaging of the cerebral circulation via the left common carotid revealed the left carotid to fill the MCA and fetal origin PCA.
You had this procedure and were monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit overnight to monitor your blood pressure.
