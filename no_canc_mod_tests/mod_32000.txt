She was brought to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital where initial CXR did not show infiltrate or CHF.
Eventually, her cardiac markers came back positive: Troponins 8.8, 8.8 and 4.6, CK 237, 190, 163; MB 56, 43, 40.
A RHC was not done.
She was on a non-rebreather saturating 100% with SBP 110.

The previously suspected nodular opacity is not seen on the current study and may be obscured, thus evaluation with follow-up radiograph is recommended.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-4-21**] normal sinus rhythm with probable left atrial abnormality has given way to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and the heart rate has nearly doubled.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared to the previous tracing sinus rhythm has replaced atrial fibrillation.
Routine radiographs are recommended as a first step and to see if additional imaging with CT scanning is indicated.
Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic HF: Had crackles all the way up the lung fields bilaterally on admission.
EF in [**12-6**] was 45-50%, now 40-45%.
Sputum culture with yeast and 1 colony of mold, no clinical evidence of infection.
Afib/Arrhythmias: Pt developed afib with RVR on [**2178-4-22**] with HR to 150s.
Code blue was called but patient quickly recovered blood pressure, heart rate and respirations wihtout intervention.
She will have her device checked in the [**Hospital **] clinic in one week.
Blood pressure: Patient developed hypotension requiring pressors after intubation likely related to intubation.
