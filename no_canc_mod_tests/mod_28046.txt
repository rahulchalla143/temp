She was admitted for preoperative cardiac evalauation and vascular intervention.

Pertinent Results: [**2190-7-29**] 03:55AM BLOOD WBC-18.5* RBC-3.77* Hgb-11.5* Hct-35.0* MCV-93 MCH-30.5 MCHC-32.8 RDW-15.4 Plt Ct-291 [**2190-7-29**] 03:55AM BLOOD Glucose-114* UreaN-70* Creat-1.7* Na-140 K-4.0 Cl-105 HCO3-24 AnGap-15  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 16646**] was admitted and underwent persantine MIBI on [**2190-7-16**] which revealed a moderate fixed perfusion defect of the inferior wall - no reversible perfusion defects were identified.
The EKG portion showed approximately 1 mm lateral and apical ST depressions which were 0.5 mm additional over baseline ST depressions.
Further evaluation included an echocardiogram which found a severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets, severe AS with mild AI.
The aortic peak and mean gradients were 73 and 46 mm Hg.
The ECHO was also notable for mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation.
Subsequent cardiac cathterization on [**2190-7-19**] revealed severe three vessel disease and severe AS.
The [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] was estimated at 0.7 cm2 with a gradient of 49 mmHg.
Angiography showed a 60% ostial left main stenosis; 50% lesion in the mid LAD, 90% obtuse marginal stenosis, and 80% lesion in the RCA.
Further evaluation included vein mapping and carotid ultrasound which found no significant disease of the internal carotid arteries.
Postop TEE showed no AI, 1+ MR with an LVEF of 50%.
Her urine output eventually improved with volume and PRBC's.
By discharge, her oxygen saturations were 98% on 2L nasal cannula.
She was also noted to have a leukocytosis, white count peaked to 18K.
All lines were removed and cultures remained negative.
By discharge, her white count improved to 13K.
