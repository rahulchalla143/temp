Electrocardiogram with bradycardia, left axis deviation and ST elevations in 2, 3 and AVF, V3-V5 and ST depressions in AVL, V2, V1 also with a right bundle branch block.
At that point he went into a wide complex tachycardia, which was read as V fibrillation and was shocked with 200 jewels with conversion to junctional rhythm of 100 beats per minute and the patient at that point was hemodynamically stable.
The patient was given a half a dose of Retavase for lytic therapy and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation and catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs upon arrival to the Emergency Department, pulse of 71 and blood pressure of 106/palp and afebrile.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 139, potassium 3.6, chloride 105, bicarb 27, BUN 10, creatinine 1.1, glucose 108, white blood cell 9.2, hematocrit 42.8, platelet 440, MCV 101.
INR .91 and PTT of 28.2.
Chest x-ray showed EP tube in right main, opacity in retrocardiac, possible atelectasis versus pneumonia and on arrival his electrocardiogram was pending.
His catheterization showed an RA of 23/24/22, RV of 33/23, PA 33/22, wedge of 22/24, [**3-24**], LV of 90/22, SVR 1082 and PVR of 25.
His EF was 39% with hypokinetic anterolateral apical and inferior walls.
His lipids were checked and liver function tests were checked.
His CKs were followed post intervention and the goal was to keep the CVP around 18 to 20.
Rhythm, his electrolytes were checked regularly.
The goal was to keep his K over 4 and his magnesium over 2.
He had an atropine at bedside for possible bradycardia and secondary hypotension secondary to bradycardia, which was not used and his beta blockers as we noted earlier was held on the first day and later on started as he tolerated it.
The patient did well and has been afebrile and white blood cell count decreasing daily since transfer to the floor.
The patient was sent to rehab center for further evaluation and further treatment.
