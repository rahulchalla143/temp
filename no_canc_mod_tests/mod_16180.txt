The patient describes pain as in the interscapular radiating to her chest [**11-11**] and constant.
The patient called her daughter, who brought her to [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] triage at 12 pm there, and her blood pressure on admission was 202/110, pulse of 79.
She had 8/10 chest pain.
At that point, her electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70, normal axis, and normal intervals.
No change from an electrocardiogram done on [**2111-1-30**] at the outside hospital.
The patient at the outside hospital was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin x3 with resolution of the chest pain, but her back pain was still present, and the blood pressure remained elevated at 195/68 in the right and 185/60 to the left.
Her blood pressure at that point was 190/70 and heart rate of 70.
She had a CT scan of the chest with contrast which showed acute versus chronic descending aortic dissection not extending to the renal arteries.
However, her blood pressure remained elevated at 213/87.
She was started on Nipride drip at 2 mcg/kg/minute, however, the patient then became hypotensive 90/palp, and Nipride was turned off, and she was restarted on Nipride at a much lower dose with the Esmolol, and her blood pressure normalized at 135/65.
They recommended a followup CT scan in six months and every six months to evaluate the dissection.
She had a Thallium stress in [**2110-2-3**] which revealed a reversible inferolateral defect and posterior bibasilar scar, but the patient refused cardiac catheterization at that time.
Prednisone, Prilosec, and Norvasc 5 mg po q day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a temperature of 98.6, blood pressure of 105/60, and a heart rate of 78.
Sating 94% on room air.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.
LABORATORY DATA:  Patient had a white blood cell count of 15.4, 89% neutrophils, 7% lymphocytes, hematocrit of 36.2, and platelets of 388.
She had an INR of 1.1, PT of 12.8 and PTT of 25.2, sodium of 140, potassium 4.2, chloride 102, bicarb 22, BUN 14, creatinine 0.4, glucose of 113.
Her CK was 90 at the outside hospital, 75 here, and then 83.
MBs were not done.
She had a CT scan at the outside hospital read by the [**Hospital1 **] senior attending, who read a descending aortic dissection DeBakey-type III, type A.
She had a chest x-ray which showed clear, no evidence of congestive heart failure or mediastinum.
Of note, she has a past cardiac workup including the following:  An echocardiogram in [**2111-4-3**] which showed a normal left ventricular size with low systolic dysfunction.
Normal wall thickness and left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%.
She had a Thallium stress test done in [**2110-2-3**] which showed moderate areas of decreased Thallium uptake in the inferolateral region which resolved with rest and there was a fixed defect in the posterior basilar region, and the patient refused a cardiac catheterization.
Of note, the patient's total cholesterol was 206, LDL of 133, and HDL of 58, triglycerides of 73.
Cardiovascular:  As mentioned, this patient came in with back pain, some mild chest pain at that point, and elevated blood pressures treated with Esmolol and nitroglycerin drip which were titrated to give her a blood pressure of roughly 130-140 systolic.
Her back pain completely resolved by the second day of hospitalization, and her blood pressures remained stable as did her heart rate in the generally the 70s or 80s normal sinus rhythm.
The CT scan was read as a possible acute and chronic dissection of the thoracic aorta.
It is hypothesized that the patient was wiping off her car, had some discomfort, which raised her blood pressure.
Her creatinine did not bump during her hospital admission.
Her blood pressure was 118 the afternoon of discharge.
From a coronary artery disease standpoint, there were no symptoms or electrocardiogram changes, and she has no ischemic disease at this point, and there is no indication for cardiac catheterization or further stress test.
