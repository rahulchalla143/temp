RADIOLOGY: ============ HEAD CT [**2151-9-7**]: Large(6 x 3 cm) mass w/ surrounding edema + leftward subfalcine herniation; prob sm hemorrhagic component; centered in R basal ganglia .
MRI HEAD [**2151-9-7**]: TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted gadolinium-enhanced brain imaging.
COMPARISON STUDY: Non-contrast head CT scan of the same day reported by Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) 18954**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as revealing "brain mass with surrounding vasogenic edema and subfalcine herniation, which could represent a neoplasm or an infection such as toxoplasmosis."
The extensive surrounding edema and enormous mass effect, described in detail on the previous CT scan are unchanged compared with that study.
CT head stereotaxis with contrast ([**9-7**]): FINDINGS:  Again seen is a large heterogeneous mass centered within the right basal ganglia and internal capsule and significant surrounding vasogenic edema.
CT Head s/p biopsy ([**9-8**]): FINDINGS:  There is a new intracranial air, which is related to recent biopsy and a new cranial defect through the right side of the frontal bone.
The mass, measured in the same way as the comparison study is essentially unchanged, measuring 5.7 x 3.6 cm in axial dimensions with surrounding vasogenic edema and a similar degree of leftward shift of the midline structures.
IMPRESSION:  Other than post biopsy changes, which are anticipated, namely intracranial air, no significant change is seen.
Pan-CT ([**9-8**]): CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The previously described tiny low-density liver lesion is not identified on the current study, likely due to small size and slice selection.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Distal ureters, bladder, sigmoid colon, and rectum are unremarkable.
Bone marrow biopsy ([**9-10**]): FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 19, 20, 23, 45.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST ([**9-11**]):  Again seen is a mass centered within the right basal ganglia, and containing a small amount of increased density, which is not significantly changed in comparison to the prior study.
MRI LUMBAR SPINE W/O CONTRAST ([**9-11**]): TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T1 and T2 axial images of the lumbar spine were obtained.
Comparison was made with the previous study of [**2146-10-28**].
At L4-5 central and left paracentral broad-based disc protrusion is identified which is unchanged from the previous study.
MRI LUMBAR SPINE W/ CONTRAST ([**9-12**]): TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar post-gadolinium T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through the lumbar spine.
The study is correlated with prior from [**2151-9-11**], where the pre-contrast images were obtained.
His CT scan was consistent with a large 3x3cm brain mass in the basal ganglia region with midline shift.
Patient was placed on mannitol for brain swelling, with careful monitoring of serum osmolality and electrolytes.
Patient developed fecal incontinence during admission and had an MRI performed, which showed no enhancement of his leptomeninges consistent with leptomeningeal spread.
He also had a repeat head CT performed due to concern for worsening neurological symptoms, which was negative.
His CMV VL levels were undetectable.
Patient was also initiated on HAART during his admission, and CT torso and testicular ultrasound was performed due to concern for primary malignancy as cause for disease.
Initial pathology came back consistent with CNS toxoplasmosis, however, and patient was started on clindamycin and pyrimethazine.
His G6PD screen was intermediate, and patient was not placed on sulfa treatment due to concern for hemolysis.
An LP was not performed due to concern for herniation.
He had no signs of subphrenic abscess on CT scan.
His hemolysis labs were negative.
His urine and serum osmolality were confounded by the use of mannitol, though most consistent with SIADH, likely from CNS lesion.
He will have his electrolytes checked after discharge.
