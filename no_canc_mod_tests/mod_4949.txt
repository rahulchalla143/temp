A stool sample was positive for c. difficile and he was started on metronidazole as well.
Initially he needed blood pressure support with pressor agents and was started on hydrocortisone/fludrocortisone due to a low random cortisol.
After his blood pressure stablized off pressor agents he was transferred to the regular floor on [**8-20**] and he remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile until discharge on [**8-22**].
He was weaned off both hydrocortisone and fludricortisone and his blood pressure remained stable.
His blood sugar control was adequate on this regimen and he was encouraged to follow up on this issue with his PCP.
Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine was elevated initially in the ED (2.2) but returned to his baseline (0.9) with hydration and this was thought to be due mostly to a pre-renal state.
Disposition: He was initially planning to go to a rehab facility but felt increasingly stronger throughout his hospital stay and elected to go home to stay with his brother.
