HEAD CT: There is residual IV contrast(given in OSH) in the dural venous sinuses.
MRI of  C-SPINE:[**2192-2-11**] Subluxation of C6 over C7 with appearances suggestive of a flexion injury and disruption of the posterior longitudinal, interspinous and anterior longitudinal ligaments and anterior subluxation of C6 over C7.
ECHO; [**2192-2-13**] The left atrium is elongated.
Comparison was made with the previous MRI examination of [**2192-2-11**].
However, at C6-7 and inferiorly to T2 level, there is increased signal seen within the central portion of the spinal cord which could be secondary to cord edema or ischemic changes within the cord.
Followup examination is suggested.
At that time, chest and pelvis X-rays were negative fro fractures, although he did have a tiny right upper lobe nodule that should be followed up in one year.
Hand X-rays were negative for fracture.
A CT of his C-spine revealed a traumatic grade II anterolisthesis of C6 on C7 with a right inferior C6 facet fracture and locking of the C6-7 facets.
A CT of his head demonstrated a hazy area of increased attenuation along the medial right frontal lobe, which was unclear whether it was secondary to previously administered IV contrast or a small amount of subarachnoid blood.
Since he had been on coumadin for a previous DVT (INR 1.6), he had to be corrected with 2 units of FFP and vitamin K.  On HD 2, a repeat head CT showed a small focus of hyperdensity along the medial border of the right frontal lobe concerning for an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, as well as a small (4mm width) subdural fluid collection concerning for a small subdural effusion.
An MRI of his spine showed a subluxation of C6 over C7 with appearances suggestive of a flexion injury and disruption of the posterior longitudinal, interspinous and anterior longitudinal ligaments and anterior subluxation of C6 over C7.
Intraoperative X-rays demonstrated posterior spinal rods and pedicle screws within the C5, C6, and C7 vertebral bodies.
A postoperative chest X-ray demonstrated findings consistent with CHF and fluid overload.
His post op Hct was 33 and his INR was 1.3.
His lactate was 8.9 initially, then peaked at 13.8 and then dropped to 9.6.
He also had an elevated troponin to 0.29, then 0.37, which was though to be due to renal failure (createnine 1.9 from 1.4), although his EKG was significant for ST depressions in V3-V6, II and AVF.
On POD 1, he was started on mannitol 25 g Q 6 hours for 48 hours.
A CT of his abdomen and pelvis was done because of his acidosis and showed extensive consolidation of both lower lung zones, with airspace opacities in the right middle lobe, suggestive of aspiration or aspiration pneumonia, small bilateral pleural effusions, diverticulosis without diverticulitis, and small atrophic kidneys.
A CT of his C-spine showed a nondisplaced fracture, probably from hyperextension, of anterior inferior portion of T2 vertebral body; this may involve a tiny portion of the middle column, and therefore may be an unstable fracture.
It also showed slight retrolisthesis of C6 on C7 and slight anterolisthesis of C7 on T1, much improved since last exam (both now grade 1).
A CT of his head showed no significant change.
Cardiology was consulted due to his elevated troponins and they recommended aspirin (when stable), B-blockers to keep the HR at 60, and an echocardiogram.
A repeat head CT showed interval enlargement of bilateral frontal subdural hygromas, which were not present on the initial CT of [**2192-2-10**].
It also showed a persistent filiform hyperdensity at the medial aspect of the right frontal lobe, unchanged since the prior study (diagnostic possibilities include subarachnoid hemorrhage versus vascular calcification).
Lower extremity ultrasounds revealed no evidence of acute DVT.
An echocardiogram (EF > 55%) was unremarkable.
His INR 1.3, his createnine was 1.8, and his lactate was 1.3.
A chest X-ray demonstrated worsening CHF.
On POD 4, his createnine was down to 1.6.
His WBC climbed from 12.4 to 15.9 and he had a temperature of 100, so he was started on Vancomycin and Levaquin for pneumonia.
On POD 5, his createnine was down to 1.3.
His WBC was down to 12.7.
His INR was down to 1.1.
A swallow evaluation was done, which he failed due to discoordinated swallow.
On POD 6, his createnine was 1.1 and his WBC was 10.
A repeat spinal MRI was done- there was no evidence of intraspinal fluid collection or extrinsic spinal cord compression, with mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5 level secondary to disc bulging and increased signal within the spinal cord from C6-7 to T2 level indicative of cord edema or ischemia within the cord.
On POD 8, a SOMI brace was ordered because we assumed that his T2 fracture seen on MRI was unstablesince he was having some lower extremity weakness.
Troponins were re-drawn and found to be 0.23.
A Passy-muir valve was unable to be placed due to the brace.
Sputum cultures were sent.
His sputum grew MRSA, but medicine recommended witholding treatment unless there were signs of infection.
On POD 12, his chest X-ray showed decreased CHF.
On [**2192-2-26**] patient had a emesis about 1000ml, hemaoccult was positive, however occult blood in stool was negative on rectral exam.
