CAD s/p MI x3 2. systolic heart failure (EF 25-30%) 3. hypertension 4. dyslipidemia 5. diabetes mellitus type II since [**2115**] 6. tobacco abuse 7. atrial fibrillation 8. left nephrectomy [**2068**]  Social History: Smokes one pack of cigarettes daily.
Physical Exam: T-98.1 BP-131/67 HR-80 RR-16 Weight-199 pounds Gen: Pleasant, obese, non-toxic Neck: Soft, supple, no LAD, 2+ carotid pulses, very faint R carotid bruit CV: RRR, normal S1 and S2, II/VI flow murmur at the base, no r/g Pulm: Scant bibasilar crackles Abd: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, active bowel sounds Back: No CVA or paraspinal tenderness Ext: 1+ BLE pitting edema to the knees, 2+ DP/femoral/radial pulses, no femoral bruits Neuro: Alert, appropriate  Pertinent Results: OSH Labs:  WBC-5.1 Hct-38.8 MCV-85.9 Plt-171 Na-138 K-4.7 Cl-103 Bicarb-29 BUN-17 Cr-1.0 Glu-295 Ca-9.1 Serial CK/MB: 250/26.7 Serial Troponin I: 0.20, 7.68, 5.43, 4.68 BNP: 582  U/A: trace protein, trace LE, o/w negative  EKG (initial): atrial fibrillation at roughly 150 beats per minute, normal axis, 1-2 mm ST segment depressions V4-V6  EKG ([**5-27**]): normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, 0.5-1 mm ST segment depressions V4-V6, T wave flattening I and aVL  OSH TTE (per report): EF 25-30%, multiple regional WMA  [**2130-5-29**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound Mild to moderate plaque in the bilateral internal carotid arteries, right worse than left.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a left dominant system with three vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated right sided (mean RA 21 mmHg), pulmonary (mean PA 28 mm Hg) and left sided pressures (mean PCWP 21 mmHg) with no gradient upon movement of the catheter from the ventricle to the aorta.
The cardiac index was moderately depressed (1.9 l/min/m2).
Left ventriculography was deferred for high left sided pressures.
[**2130-5-29**] ECHO 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.

A cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed a 50% stenosed left main, a 90% stenosed left anterior descending artery, a 90% stenosed circumflex artery and an occluded right coronary artery.
A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which revealed a 40-59% stenosed right and less then a 40% stenosed left internal carotid artery.
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 30-35%, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation, [**12-25**]+ tricuspid regurgitation and a mildly dilated left atrium.
Mr. [**Known lastname 106769**] INR was markedly elevated on postoperative day 5 and as he remained in normal sinus rhythm, it was decided to discontinue his coumadin and amiodarone.
As Mr. [**Known lastname 106769**] blood pressure remained low, it was elected to wait until his blood pressure improved prior to starting an ace-inhibitor.
Thus, an ace-inhibitor should be started as an outpatient given his low ejection fraction and preoperative myocardial infarction.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Health Care - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Preop MI Coronary Artery Disease Diabetes  Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: 1) Monitor wounds for signs of infection.
