In the Emergency Room, the patient was found to be in atrial flutter with a ventricular rhythm in the 150s, blood pressure 128/94, respiratory rate 34 to 40 and an oxygen saturation of 95%, with an examination consistent with congestive heart failure.
There was no improvement in his hemodynamic status, and evidence of worsening congestive heart failure despite initial treatment with intravenous diltiazem 70 mg, intravenous Lopressor 40 mg and intravenous Lasix 40 mg.  DC cardioversion was attempted twice, with reversion to a nodal rhythm with a heart rate in the 40s and a blood pressure of 80 to 120/palpable.
Given his aspiration, bilateral infiltrates on a chest x-ray, hypoxia and poor pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, there was an initial concern that he was entering acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The patient had elevated troponin levels post cardioversion, with slightly elevated CK and a peak CK/MB of 10.
A transthoracic echocardiogram at this point showed depressed left ventricular systolic function and his major cardiac issues in this admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit were rate control and rhythm.
He required frequent intravenous Lopressor boluses to control his heart rate and was started on a diltiazem drip.
His blood pressure was controlled with a Neo-Synephrine drip for approximately three days following admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's creatinine peaked at 2.7 and began to trend down to baseline within the next five days and he had good urine output.
He failed a swallowing evaluation and, over the course of the day, was noted to be more lethargic with more labored breathing over the course of the day.
His examination was notable for the development of decreased breath sounds and crackles at the left base.
Arterial blood gases were remarkable for a rising cO2.
He was restarted on a diltiazem drip for heart rate control.
He was weaned off all pressors and sedatives, extubated, and sent to the floor once again.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 98.8, heart rate 93 to 102, blood pressure 104 to 133/43 to 77, respiratory rate 11 to 27 and oxygen saturation 99% on three liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric sclerae, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, moist mucous membranes, no oral lesions.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 7.2, hematocrit 32.3, platelet count 238,000, prothrombin time 13.3, INR 1.2, partial thromboplastin time 60.8, sodium 144, potassium 3.5, chloride 108, bicarbonate 31, BUN 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose 106, calcium 7.7, magnesium 2.1 and phosphorous 2.8.
RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Chest x-ray showed no cardiomegaly, pulmonary vasculature normal, persistent opacification of the retrocardiac space which was stable in appearance but most likely represented atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Echocardiogram from [**2122-11-13**] showed mildly dilated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with overall severe depression of left ventricular systolic function and severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, mild aortic insufficiency, mild mitral regurgitation, no significant change from prior study of [**2122-10-26**].
Cardiovascular:  Initially, the patient's atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate was difficult to control.
His diltiazem was increased to 90 mg three times a day, with control of his heart rate into the 100s and blood pressure ranging around 150/70.
After ablation, the patient's rate was well controlled in the low 80s.
His oxygen saturation remained good, in the 98% range initially on two to three liters of oxygen, which he was weaned off of throughout the course of his stay.
