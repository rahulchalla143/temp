The patient had no signs of infection and his head CT was negative for mass or bleed.
In addition, the patient's hypotension with SBP ~70 was considered another likely contributor to his altered mental status.
Furthermore, the patient was taking in poor PO intake and was likely dehydrated; this was supported by the fact that his BP rose nicely with IVF.
The patient's BP was stable during his entire admission.
# Tachycardia: The patient had difficulty with tachycardia during this admission and had heart rates in the 110's and 120's at times.
These were held for low blood pressure < 100 or heart rate < 50. .
His rate was controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem as outlined above and he should continue on the long-acting forms of these medications after discharge, as detailed.
