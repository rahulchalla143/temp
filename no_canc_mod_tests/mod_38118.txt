ECG at the outside hospital showed inferior lead ST elevation with reciprocal changes throughout.
Physical exam was within normal limits.
The patient was afebrile, heart rate 90, regular rate, blood pressure 127/80.
Heart exam within normal limits with normal S1, S2, no murmurs appreciated, no S3 or S4.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The remainder of the physical exam was within normal limits.
The patient's pulses were 2+ throughout.
The patient's chemistries were within normal limits except for potassium of 3.4 from the outside hospital.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:  Please refer to the full report for further details.
The patient's filling pressures were slightly elevated in the cath lab with a right atrial pressure of 15, right ventricular pressure of 38/20, PA pressure of 38/28, and wedge pressure of 28.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 35-year-old female, a smoker, brought in from an outside hospital with substernal chest pain, as well as inferior lead ST elevation, status post coronary catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] with stent placement.
The patient transferred to coronary care unit after coronary catheterization for further monitoring.
The patient's ECG normalized; however, she did develop inferior Q waves by the day after her myocardial infarction.
The patient's lipid profile was obtained and showed a total cholesterol of 140, triglycerides 198, HDL 33, LDL 67.
2) HEMODYNAMICS:  The patient arrived from the catheterization lab on Neo-Synephrine which was titrated off overnight.
The patient's blood pressure tolerated this well, did not require pressors, and also tolerated the beta blocker well.
4) PUMP:  The patient's echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45-50%, as well as focal, severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior wall.
The remainder of the echocardiogram was within normal limits with 1+ mitral regurgitation seen.
8) ACCESS:  The patient initially with a Swan-Ganz catheter that was placed in the catheterization lab which was discontinued.
The patient did have a small femoral artery hematoma that was stabilized with direct pressure and was stable x 48 hours at discharge.
