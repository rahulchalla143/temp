Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system  revealed multi-vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated biventricular filling pressures, with an RVEDP of 20mmHg and a mean PCWP of 36 mmHg (before lasix given).
The mixed venous 02 saturation was 48, giving a cardiac output of 4.0 and a cardiac index of 1.8, indicating cardiogenic shock prior to placement of the IABP.
The aortic valve gradient was 22, yielding a valve area of 0.9, indicating moderate-to-severe AS.

Myocardial Infarction Upon admission to the hospital, patient was found to have ST depressions in V4 through V6 with markedly elevated CK to a peak of 2843 with MB 618 and Troponin T peaked to 13.88.
His blood pressure slowly improved, and he was then restarted on his cardiac regimen of an aspirin, beta blocker, ACEI, and statin.
His blood pressure improved; however, he was then thought to be septic due to bacteremia.
His blood pressure improved with medical management of his heart disease and bacteremia.
His liver function tests and creatinine were transiently elevated in the setting of his hypotension but improved throughout hospital course.
Repeat blood cultures were negative ad line was discontinued.
Pneumonia Patient had an initial sputum culture which was positive for moraxella catarrhalis.
Repeat chest CT imaging demonstrated development of a complicated left sided effusion.
Cultures were positive for MSSA for which he was treated wtih nafcillin.
The empyema drain is still in place and daily CXR were done to monitor progress.
He has an appt with a thoracic surgeon in 1 week with a CXR before the appt to evaluate the tube and possibly remove it.
Blood cultures and a catheter tip culture returned positive with MSSA.
He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2190-2-18**] which did not demonstrate a clear cause of his respiratory failure.
He had oxygen saturations in low-mid 90s on room air at time of discharge  8.
Acute Kidney Injury Patient initially presented with marked acute kidney injury with a creatinine that peaked at 4 during his admission.
His creatinine slowly improved back to approximately 2.7 - 2.9.
His blood sugars were maintained on adequate control with fingerstick ranging from 100-200 on his sliding scale and long-acting basal insulin.
Patient's baseline hematocrit appears to be in the low 30s with a previous hematocrit of 31.6 in [**2186**].
His hematocrit has remained stable between 26-30 during the last 5 days of his admission.
His liver function tests were abnormal during his admission, although this was thought likely related to his shock liver.
His liver function tests were improved after starting simvastatin.
Peripheral Neuropathy He was continue on his gabapentin during his admission.
Hypernatremia Patient did have complications of hypernatremia during this admission with a peak sodium of 150.
Upon discharge, his sodium was 139.
As patient's blood pressure improved, he was restarted on beta blocker, ACEI, and a decreased dose of lasix.
Aortic Stenosis Patient was found to have a moderate aortic stenosis with a valve area of [**12-24**].2cm2.
