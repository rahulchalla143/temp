Presenting to the catheterization laboratory, catheterization revealed a very small right coronary artery with good collaterals to left anterior descending, chronically occluded left anterior descending and evidence of circumflex disease.
The patient's INR and PTT were checked and found to be 9.0 and 89 respectively, which was an elevation of an INR of 1.03 and PTT of 26.8 at the outside hospital.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs on presentation to Cardiac Care Unit were:  Blood pressure 130/95; pulse 81; saturation 100%.
The patient was on a respirator, SAMV mode, the total volume was 700, respiratory rate 14, PEEP of 5 and FIO2 of 1.0.
Extremities showed a large expanding right groin hematoma with no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse on the right but palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses on the left lower extremity.
The patient's Swan numbers revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 and a right ventricular pressure of 30/50, wedge 15, pulmonary artery saturation of 74%.
LABORATORY:   The patient's white blood cell count was 16.4 with a hematocrit of 46.3, platelets of 359 with a differential of 63 neutrophils and 6 bands.
Troponin was less than 0.02.
CK was 94, LDH was 247.
Basic Metabolic Profile 131/4.2; 97/18; 7/1.2; 158.
The patient's PTT was 89.7, and INR was 9.8, as mentioned previously.
The patient was monitored on Telemetry throughout the course of his stay.
The patient's CK peaked at 1374, troponin greater than 50.
The patient was bleeding profusely from his groin site during catheterization, from an INR of 9.8 and PTT of 89.7.
The patient's platelets dropped to as low as 109.
Following treatment with fresh frozen plasma and cryo precipitate, the patient's INR had decreased to 1.6.
The patient's hematocrit had dropped as low as 27.9 but after receiving an additional one unit of packed red blood cells, returned to the normal range and stayed within normal limits during the course of his hospitalization.
Sputum culture grew out coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
Additionally, further sputum samples grew out Gram negative rods that were subsequently identified as Klebsiella pneuma.
The patient was afebrile with decreasing white blood cell count at the time of discharge.
The patient was placed on a CIWA scale and given Ativan, thus patient was changed to standing dose of benzodiazepines.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:   The patient had a significant history of alcohol abuse, thus, he was given thiamine, folate and multivitamin throughout the course of his hospital stay.
