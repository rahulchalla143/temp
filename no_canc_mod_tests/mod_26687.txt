# Respiratory failure: Per report, intubated for hypoxic resp failure at OSH; however, had hypercapnia on initial ABG at [**Hospital1 **], c/w COPD flare (likely w/ elevated CO2 levels at baseline).
Differential includes COPD exacerbation vs PE (given acute onset, Rt axis on EKG).
No evidence of PNA, ARDS or other lung pathology on initial CXR other than chronic changes of COPD; however, CTA on [**12-21**] was negative for PE and showing RLL collapse.
Bronchoscopy on [**12-21**] was unremarkable for obstructing lesion or other pathology.
-extubated [**12-22**] -Cont ceftriaxone/azithro to cover CAP/COPD exacerbation - completed azithro  [**12-23**], recommend 3 more days of ceftriaxone -Steroids: Rapid taper - now off -Inhalers -f/u micro data -f/u OSH micro - none available -f/u OSH labs (CBC, ABG, CHEM 10) The patient was managed for his COPD exacerbation with pulse steroids, antibiotics, and intensifying his CODP inhaler therapies.
# CAD: Enzymes negative X3.
