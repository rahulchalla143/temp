GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=40%).
Interpretation assigned to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD, Interpreting physician    Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 1169**] was admitted on [**3-28**] after he underwent a mitral valve repair, CABG x 3, and aortic valve replacement.
Postoperatively he was on milrinone, levophed and epinephrine to maintain his cardiac output and blood pressure.
Echo showed global hypokinesis.
At 6:30 AM on POD #13, he acutely decompensated with acute respiratory failure on the floor.
He had agonal breathing, was bradycardic and had palpable pulses and was intubated by anesthesia emergently during the code.
Sternum found to be unstable on exam (no CPR had been performed).Bronchoscopy done to rule out aspiration.
Lactate rose to 11 and general surgery was urgently consulted.Creatinine rose to 2.2 and INR was 2.9.
The general surgery team then did an exploratory laparotomy to evaluate for acute mesenteric ischemia.
