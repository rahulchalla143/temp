Brief Hospital Course: 83yo male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis.
Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections thought related to his pseudocyst.
The patient had an ICU course s/p resuscitation wherein he did not regain mental faculties or responsiveness.
He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst.
Hepatic Cirrhosis Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although patient has no history of this in the past.
His hematocrit has remained stable during this admission from 27-30.
