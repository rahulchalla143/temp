TTE [**2163-3-24**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-12-8**], the aortic valve gradient and max TR gradeint are higher however they were probably underestimated on the prior study.
CXR [**2163-3-26**]: There has been placement of new left-sided pacemaker with the distal lead tips in the right atrium, right ventricle and appropriately sited.
However, EKG and troponins did not suggest any ischemia and the patient went for ppm placement.
Post procedural CXR demonstrated no effusions or pneumothroax and correct placment of leads.
# Hypotension: Patient had episode of hypotension to the 90s and concurrent chest pain.
# Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure:   Patient had no symptoms or exam findings suggestive of an acute exacerbation though did have pulmonary edema noted on CXR and hyperkalemia.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: patient presented with a Cr of 2.7, with a K of 6.6 and Na of 129.
# CAD: pt had CP but cardiac enzymes and EKG were negative for signs of ischemia.
