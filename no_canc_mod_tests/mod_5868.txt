Ultrasound demonstrated a footling breech with estimated fetal weight of 594 grams, in the 42nd percentile.
Heart rate was greater than 100 at 1.5 minutes of life, with pink color.
The baby was brought to the [**Name (NI) **] Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.
Apgars of 1 at one minute, 4 at five minutes, 5 at ten minutes, and 5 at 20 minutes.
The baby was placed on high-frequency ventilation with a MAP of 8, frequency of 15, and oxygen weaned to 31% FIO2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, ill-appearing infant, weight 725 grams (just below the 50th percentile), head circumference 21 cm (25th percentile), length 34.5 cm (greater than 50th percentile).
Temperature 91.4, heart rate 180s, initial blood pressure with a mean of less than 20, oxygen saturation initially 99% on 100% FIO2, weaned quickly to 31% with oxygen saturations of 95%.
LABORATORY DATA:   CBC:  White count 15.7, hematocrit 42%, platelets 216,000.
Arterial blood gas:  7.11/48/84/base excess -11.
Blood culture was sent.
Chest x-ray initially showed a high endotracheal tube that was advanced, bilaterally well-expanded lungs, evidence of reticulogranular pattern, diffuse, consistent with hyaline membrane disease.
Baby was transitioned to the conventional ventilator due to difficulty oxygenating on HFOV, with ventilator settings of 20/5 and a rate of 30, and about 60 to 70% oxygen.
He received three doses of surfactant, and managed to wean down to ventilator settings of 19/5 and a rate of 22.
His blood gases normalized, with pH of 7.31 to 7.42, CO2 in the high 30s to 50s, and was requiring 27 to 36% oxygen.
As stated previously, chest x-ray was consistent with hyaline membrane disease.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The baby was nothing by mouth.
Total fluids started at 140 cc/kg and were advanced based on electrolytes to 180 cc/kg.
Initial electrolytes: 148/5.5/116/16, ionized calcium .96.
Maximum sodium on day of life one was 158, and on [**3-6**] he had electrolytes of 147, hemolyzed potassium of 6.2, chloride of 111, CO2 of 23.
His maximum bilirubin was 4.5/.4.
He did receive one blood transfusion of 15 cc/kg initially after birth because of his hypotension.
His subsequent hematocrit was 47.7, and repeat after that was 40.8.
Infectious Disease:  Initially had CBC done with a white count of 10.8, 23 polys, 4 bands, 59 lymphs, platelets of 216,000.
A blood culture was sent, and he was started on ampicillin and gentamicin.
His gentamicin levels were a peak of 2 and a trough of 2.2.
Blood cultures remained negative.
Neurology:  Because of his initial perinatal depression and clinical examination and gestational age, head ultrasound was done on day of life one.
Neurological examination was abnormal, with little spontaneous movements, no spontaneous respirations, and flaccid tone.
The father arrived on [**3-6**] in the morning, and was updated in several meetings on [**Known lastname 4946**] progress, with the long-term prognosis and serious concerns for devastating sequelae given early manifestations including significant perinatal depression, persistent abnormal neurological examination, diffuse posterior sagittal echodensities on head ultrasound, and seizure activity.
