She was noted to be in new renal failure, with creatinine of 3.2.

Echo [**9-16**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the interventricular septum, anterior free wall, lateral wall, and apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CXR [**9-16**]: CHEST, AP UPRIGHT: Examination is suboptimal due to patient motion and underpenetration.
Renal U/S: RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 8.6 cm, and the left kidney measures 8.4 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo F with history of HTN, DM, hypercholesterolemia, originally presented to OSH with increasing shortness of breath over the last four days with EKG concerning for NSTEMI and elevated Cr concerning for new renal failure.
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed an EF of 35%.
A BNP was 15,555 and the patient's chest x-ray showed frank pulmonary edema.
Urine lytes were obtained and did not show a pre-renal state.
Urine microscopy was obtained and showed a bland sediment with no casts.
Her UA showed positive blood, 3+ prot, pH 5, neg leuk/nit/ket.
A renal ultrasound was obtained which was suggestive for left renal artery stenosis.
# Anemia - The patient was anemic on admission, with a Hct that went to 23.9.
As she had an ACS, she was transfused with one unit PRBC with a post-transfusion Hct of 27.4.
Her Hct remained stable after the transfusion with an average of 30.
A peripheral smear showed no schistocytes and her hemolysis labs were negative.
Iron studies, B12, folate showed that she was not iron or vitamin deficient (TIBC 390 VitB12 323 Folate 9.5 Hapto Ferritin 96 TRF 300) .
# Hypercholesterolemia:  A lipid panel was obtained which showed a total cholesterol of 233, triglycierides of 138, HDL of 36, LDL of 169, and LDL/HDL ratio of 6.5.
Sarna Sensitive 1 % Lotion Sig: [**1-28**] applications Topical twice a day as needed for itching.
We took an ultrasound of your heart that showed some decreased heart function.
It was noted that your kidney function has decreased over your stay.
You will need close follow-up with your Primary Care Physician as well.
