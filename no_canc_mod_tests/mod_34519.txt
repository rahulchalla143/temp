He called the transplant center on the day of admission and they checked outpatient labs which were remarkable for K of 6.0.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.7, HR 79, BP 119/77, RR 22, 98%RA.
K was 6.3.
CBC and LFTs were consistent with priors.

[**2135-6-12**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-11**], allowing for differences in technique, there is probably little change in the bilateral pleural effusions, slightly more prominent on the left.
If there is any serious clinical concern for obstruction, CT would be necessary.

A diagnositic paracentesis was done that revealed a WBC of [**Numeric Identifier 26452**] with 90% neutrophils.
On [**7-12**] a diagnostic paracentesis was done that showed a WBC of 3.
His respiratory status improved with diuresis and CXR showed persistent left pleural effusion that was unchanged.
An  ABG was done once the patient was off O2 and it revealed A-a gradient of 48 (nl 10) which was consistent with significant shunting.
His hepatopulmonary syndrome, ascites, and left pleural effusion appeared stable, contributing to decreased pulmonary reserve but likely not contributing to acute decompensation.
CXR on [**7-15**] revealed new R sided effusion, new R sided parenchymal opacities, old L sided effusion.
Thus, it was concluded that CT and CXR changes were likely due to increased pulmonary edema likely secondary to acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria in the setting of receiving volume.
CXR from [**7-22**] showed stable LLL atelectasis with layering of a moderate L pleural effusion and improved right multifocal airspace opacities and pulmonary edema (now mild).
It was thought that  this acute decompensation might have also had a component of HRS and ATN.
Hemolytic workup was negative.
Fluid analysis showed that the fluid had a similar composition to his ascites.
He received multiple abdominal CT that never revealed an acute process.
# Pulmonary HTN: Patient had a TTE done as part of the evaluation for liver re-transplantation.
His EKG revealed no abnormalities.
Right Heart Cath showed Pulmonary HTN.
