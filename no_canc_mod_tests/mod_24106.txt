[**2110-5-29**]   MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST: final read pending  [**2110-5-28**]   CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 1.

The patient has a very limited functional baseline and so her presenting exam is also difficult.
CT of the head showed multiple, likely chronic infarcts.
CTA is without a clear occlusion (though recons pending) but perfusion studies show a possible increased MTT in the right temporal/parietal region.
The risks and benefits of tPA were discussed with the family and the decision was made to give tPA.
She was unable to tolerate MRI, so repeat head CT [**5-27**] obtained, which showed hemorrhagic transformation of stroke w. intraventricular bleed, a repeat head CT with less blood in ventricles, no hydrocephalus.
On admission exam demonstrated L sided weakness (upper and lower extremity), L facial droop, dysarthria but fluent speech; facial droop improved.
Stroke Risk Factors: - LDL: 93 - HgBA1c: 5.4 - TTE: No cardiac source of embolus identified (cannot definitively exclude) other than atrial fibrillation  Pulmonary: - A CXR demonstrated Ill-defined right upper lobe opacity is not fully characterized but could potentially represent a neoplastic mass.
Chest CT would more fully characterize this region.
The family did not wantt to persue further imaging and wanted her to be comfortable.
Hematology: - Underwent TPA [**5-26**] at 530pm, now has hemorrhagic transformation.
She also had some left upper extremity swelling and an ultrasound negative for DVT.
Infectious Disease: - urine cx c/w w. evidence of contamination on repeat UA there was 55 WBCs and therefore was given a Week supply of Bactrim.
Your aspirin was held for bleeding risk, and you should restart it in about 4 weeks after follow up imaging and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
You were checked for blood glucose control with a HgB A1c.
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 37165**] in 7 - 10 days for post hospitalization follow up.
