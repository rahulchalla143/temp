At the time EMS arrived, blood glucose was 109.
An NIHSS score of 15 (loc questions 2, right facial palsy 2, right hemiplegia 8, severe aphasia 2, dysarthria 1) was given.
A non-contrast CT of the head was thought to be unrevealing; in the setting of the patient's renal transplant and creatinine of 1.9, it was considered unsafe to perform CTA/P studies.
A repeat NIHSS survey following the imaging revealed improvement with a score of 11 (loc questions 2, right facial palsy 2, right arm  plegia 4, severe aphasia - anomia, fluent with neologisms, paraphasic errors, inappropriate to context 2, dysarthria 1; he could move the right lower extremity and sustain versus gravity without problem).
A stat non-contrast CT of the head showed no clear evidence of hemorrhage.
A normal saline bolus was given and pressors were started in an attempt to maintain an SBP of 160-180.

[**7-14**] CT Head w/o contrast: 1.
Hypotension Patient's typical blood pressure is 110-120 mmHg.
This was on pressors, but blood pressure was elevated enough for reflex bradycardia.
Urology placed a coudee, which they suggested remain in place for a few days, perhaps until voiding trial could be conducted.
Subsequent NCHCT did not reveal any hemorrhagic conversion; the area of restricted diffusion on MRI appears hypodense now on CT. On arrival to the floor [**2193-7-17**], his hemiparesis and apraxia had resolved and his primary findings on neurological exam were cognitive.
He was evaluated by our Cardiology consult service, which did not identifiy a definitive cause, and recommended additional tests, which were within normal limits (normal AM cortisol of 10.1, normal TSH of 1.3).
Cardiology did not think this heart rhythm or your symptoms require a pacemaker at this time, but this should be taken up by his PCP and followed with an ECG and possibly Holter monitoring as an outpatient.
As his bradycardia improved 8/25-26/10, he was able to sit/stand/walk without recurrence of his symptoms.
He still became confused at night, in the setting of HR 40s-50s (daytime 50s-60s).
Also of note, we recorded a FSBG of 250 after he received Prednisone 10mg on [**7-18**]; his hemoglobin A1c is 6.9%.
- Right forearm cellulitis in an intravenous access site (this was discussed with infection diseases, you need to continue on Bactrim for 10 days, and if this does not work you need to try doxycycline, and if this does not work, you may need intravenous vancomycin - you will need this followed up by your PCP.
Discharge Condition: Exam notable for frequent word replacements and/or word-finding difficulties and 0/3 recall at three minutes.
An MRI of your brain revealed a stroke involving a small part of left side of your brain, including part of your thalamus, your posterior internal capsule, and a part of the globus pallidus, thought by our stroke specialist Neurologists to be in the distribution of the anterior choroidal artery.
A patent foramen ovale (PFO) was identified in your heart, but no venous clots were found in your legs.
You were evaluated by our Cardiology consult service, which did not identify a definitive cause, and recommended additional tests, which were all within normal limits.
For now, you need to keep taking a medication that was started in the hospital, called midodrine -- you need to fill this prescription and take it three times every day to keep your blood pressure up; your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
