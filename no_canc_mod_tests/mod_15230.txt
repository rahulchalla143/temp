She initially presented to OSH on [**2170-6-17**] with hematuria in the setting of supratherapeutic INR (5).
She underwent cystoscopy on [**6-22**] which demonstrated diffuse cystitis without active bleeding.
A CT scan was suggestive of aspiration pneumonia as well as a 5x6mm nodular filling defect within the trachea at the carina level.
Her weight on admission was 131 lbs which dropped to 128.6 with diuresis (weight was 125lbs on [**2170-6-6**] office visit).
In the setting of her diuresis, her creatinine has risen to 2.5 from a baseline of 1.8-2.0.
Her lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide were on hold in the setting of renal failure.

At baseline she walks around her house with a walker  Family History: Non-contributory to presenting illness  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission Vitals- T: 98.3, 132/62, 72, 20, 97% 4L.

Radiology Report RIB UNILAT, W/ AP CHEST RIGHT Study Date of [**2170-6-30**] 1:20 PM FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from [**6-30**] at 1:43 a.m. Heart size is enlarged but stable.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2170-7-2**]): There is a dual-lead left-sided pacemaker with lead tips in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2170-7-2**]): 1.
Calcification along the pleura suggests prior granulomatous disease.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Speech and swallow eval revealed persistent aspiration which was unavoidable with oral intake.
She had a CT scan which showed some opacities which were consistent with an aspiration event.
On further review of her history it was learned that she had undergone a barium swallow during which she had aspirated and it quite likely that the CT scan was showing this barium as the aspiration.
#Acute on chronic renal failure- patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.8 at the beginning of [**2170-6-5**] and was 2.5 on admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
====================== MICU COURSE: On HD #3, patient developed increased respiratory distress on the floor with RR 40s (although satting in mid 90s on 3L NC).
CT chest was performed which showed BL patchy airspace opacities c/w pulm edema vs. multifocal pneumonia, and granular pleural opacities suggestive of prior granulomatous disease.
TTE was also performed which showed severe (3+ TR), LVEF >55%, pulm HTN, all unchanged from prior.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable, except for an episode of confusion/delirium overnight on [**7-2**] during which she desatted (likely secondary to anxiety).
