Electrocardiogram at that time showed ST elevations and J point elevations in V2 through V4.
Catheterization results showed 100% occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery and 50% stenosis of first diagonal.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature maximum 98.7, temperature current 98.3, pulse ranged from 82 to 92, blood pressure 104 to 124/67 to 74 with a mean of 86 to 99, respiratory rate of 11 to 16, oxygen saturation 94% to 98% on 2 liters.
Pulmonary artery pressure was 29/15 with a mean of 22.
Cardiac output was 7 (that was on 6 of dopamine).
Intra-aortic balloon pump augmented systole was 109, augmented diastole was 111.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, anteriorly and laterally.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times three.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Laboratories on admission revealed white count 7.8, hematocrit was 41.7, platelets of 252, MCV 89, RDW 12.7.
Chem-7 revealed sodium of 136, potassium 4.7, chloride 103, bicarbonate 22, BUN 16, creatinine 0.8, glucose 284.
PT 14.2, PTT 108.5, INR 1.3.
Creatine kinase at 11 a.m. was 83, at 5 p.m. was 3021.
Arterial blood gas at 11 a.m. was 7.33/46/115.
Creatine kinases trended from 11:15 on the day of admission from 83 to 3021 at 5 p.m. to 3450 at 11 p.m., to 1734 at 5:30 a.m. on [**9-11**], to 1277 at 11:30 a.m. on [**9-11**], to 83 at 9:30 a.m. on [**9-15**].
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram post catheterization showed continued ST elevations and J point elevations in V2 through V3.
Post catheterization echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 30%, moderate systolic dysfunction, basal anterior hypokinesis, mid anterior akinesis, basal anteroseptal hypokinesis, mid anteroseptal akinesis.
The patient was discharged to the medical floor on hospital day three and discharged from the hospital once his INR was within the 2 to 2.5 range.
Primary care physician was to check INR and titrate Zestril up and atenolol as tolerated.
