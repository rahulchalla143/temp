Comparison is made with prior study performed 12 hours earlier.
Diffuse opacities, worse in the lower lobe are unchanged, suggesting that these abnormalities likely represent pneumonia and less likely pulmonary edema.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Her CXR showed bilateral fluffy infiltrates suspicious for pulmonary edema vs. ARDS.
TTE revealed moderate-severe LVH with good systolic function (EF >55%).
Note that her dry weight is difficult to determine because her intial weight was recorded as 245 kg but her weight on [**2169-8-2**] was found to be 186.6. .
An outpatient sleep evaluation should be done when possible.
Based upon her well-appearance and repeat Bcx from [**Date range (1) 40196**] that were NGTD, it was decided that these are likely contaminants.
