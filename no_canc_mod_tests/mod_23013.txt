IMAGING: CXR [**2100-11-25**]: SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Right-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the cavoatrial junction.
Head CT [**2100-11-25**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, shift of midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
RUE U/S [**2100-11-27**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging was performed of the bilateral subclavian, right jugular, right axillary, right basilic, and right cephalic veins.
TTE [**2100-11-29**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define any valvular pathology .
Venogram [**2100-12-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.

CSF;SPINAL FLUID      SOURCE: LP // CSF #3.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2100-11-26**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2100-11-28**]):    NO GROWTH.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO VIRUS ISOLATED.
HSV negative .
Other blood cultures negative at time of discharge.
Two blood cultures are pending.
Blood cultures here were positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Parapsilosis, sensitive to fluconazole.
TTE was performed which was a very poor study but no valvular abnormalities noted.
Pt is now s/p tunneled dialysis line placement ([**12-2**]) and blood cultures have remained clear.
His liver function tests and CBC with diff should be monitored every other week and results should be faxed to the infectious disease nurses.
His labs should be checked every other week.
An ultrasound revealed a  clot in R brachial vein.
His goal INR is [**1-21**].
He should have repeat INR drawn on [**12-6**].
He had an LP as work-up for is AMS, which was unrevealing.
This was followed by another tunneled line placed [**12-2**] once blood cultures remained clear.
Goal INR is [**1-21**].

Outpatient [**Name (NI) **] Work Pt should have INR checked on [**12-6**].
Outpatient [**Month/Year (2) **] Work CBC with differential, LFTs checked on [**12-6**] and thereafter weekly and faxed to: Infectious disease R.Ns.
Your blood pressure was low after dialysis today (85/40s).
You got 250cc bolus and your blood pressure came up to 110s so we feel that you are safe to go.
If your blood pressure is low again tonight, you should get another fluid bolus.
Continue heparin drip until INR is theraputic at 2-3 on sliding scale attached.
Please hold all of your blood pressure medications unless your blood pressure is consistently greater than 120. .
You will also need to follow up with the infectious disease doctors to monitor your antibiotics and blood counts while you're on the medication.
