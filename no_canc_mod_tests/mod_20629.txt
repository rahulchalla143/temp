Taken to [**Hospital1 **] where electrocardiogram was notable for 1 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in 1, L, V1 and V3, T wave inversions in 3 and F.  The patient was started on heparin drip, enteral feed and still with 1 out of 10 pain.
Transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] Catheterization Laboratory.
Cardiac index 2.1.
Chest painfree and no other symptoms.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 75, blood pressure 135/60, respirations 14, 95% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Jugulovenous pressure flat.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Outside hospital laboratory data:  Sodium 137, potassium 2.9, chloride 100, bicarbonate 22, BUN 33, creatinine 1.3, glucose 137, white blood cell count 10.7, hematocrit 44.7, platelets 407, INR 0.9.
Arterial blood gases at [**Hospital6 256**], pH 7.5, pACO2 22, pAO2 92, sating 98% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.
Laboratory data at [**Hospital6 256**] 2:30 PM:  White blood cell count 15.7, hematocrit 39.1, platelets 343, INR 1.5, PT 15, PTT 107.
Sodium 143, potassium 3.9, chloride 110, bicarbonate 19, BUN 23, creatinine 0.2, glucose 138.
Electrocardiogram at outside hospital:  Normal sinus rhythm at 60, normal axis, interval.
No Qs, T wave inversions in 3 and F.  Cardiac catheterization showed right atrial pressures of 13/11/9, right ventricular pressures of 44/13.
PA 44/17/29, pulmonary capillary wedge 26/29/22, aortic 121/65/72, cardiac output 4.8, cardiac index 2.1.
SVR 1050, PVR 117, proximal RCA 70%, mid RCA 60%, mid LAD 100% within collaterals.
Cardiac catheterization complicated by supraventricular tachycardia, self-terminated after procedure.
The patient also had an episode of AIVR which was self-limiting after the procedure was done.
The patient was transferred t the CCU for further monitoring on ................... for 18 hours and then Plavix.
The patient did well in the CCU and had an echocardiogram done the following morning to evaluate cardiac ejection fraction.
Beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated up as tolerated by blood pressure and heart rate.
The patient is to have a repeat echocardiogram in approximately four to six weeks for reassessment of cardiac function.
The patient is also to have an outpatient stress in six weeks for further evaluation of this 70% right coronary artery lesion.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was placed on a cardiac healthy diet low fiber/cholesterol.
Prophylaxis - Ambulation was recommended to patient.
The patient discussed with cardiologist regarding having a repeat echocardiogram and stress test in four to six weeks.
