In [**2111**], the patient underwent cardiac catheterization with attempt at ramus intervention complicated by perforation of the ramus with medical treatment afterwards, then catheterization showed patent grafts, severe disease at the ostium of the ramus.
Patient refused a cardiac catheterization at that time and was discharged home on medical management.
Patient was ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes and had several more episodes of angina relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count is 6.7, hematocrit 35.4, platelets 281.
Electrolytes:  133 sodium, potassium 4.1, chloride 90, bicarb 36, BUN 8, creatinine 0.8, glucose 105.
INR of 0.9.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 162/96, saturating 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2128-8-3**], which showed elevated filling pressures, severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 40, calculated valve area of 0.7 cm.
LMCA was 30% ostial, LAD mid diffuse disease with 80% stenosis, diagonal was patent supplied by SVG, circumflex diffuse disease with 90% stenosis, RCA occluded, SVG to RCA 60-70% mid stenosis, SVG to the OM was occluded, SVG to the diagonal patent with lower pole 70% stenosis, and 80% in LAD at diagonal takeoff compromising LAD supply.
Right 30% ostial iliac, 70% iliac at the iliac bifurcation.
Cardiac Surgery was consulted and patient underwent preoperative carotid duplex, which showed a right internal carotid stenosis of less than 40% with left internal stenosis 80-99%.
Patient was noted to have an increasing white count and on day eight, and the central line was changed over wire to a central line.
Femoral A-line was removed and the radial A-line was obtained on the left.
Clostridium difficile was checked and found to be negative.
Patient did note to have some abdominal tenderness and due to the rising white count, the x-ray which had been noted to have some peritoneal air, was followed up on with a General Surgery Consult.
Ultimately, white count decreased and patient improved.
KUB G tube study showed no leak upon the injection and the followup CT was unremarkable for any abdominal pathology.
Patient had Clostridium difficile negative x2.
Blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and both line tips were cultured and found to be negative.
Patient's white count again bumped on postoperative day #12.
Patient was pancultured, and blood cultures were found to be growing gram-positive cocci.
By hospital day #14, white count had dropped from 21 down to 15.
Patient was afebrile with vital signs stable on trache at 40% and felt to be ready for discharge to a vented rehab.
