Review of the images demonstrated no caval anatomic variations, a single inferior vena cava, without intraluminal filling defects.
Based on the diagnostic findings, it was determined that an IVC filter placement was indicated.
Final abdominal radiograph demonstrated good positioning and deployment of the IVC filter.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  Reason: please evaluate liver with non-contrast scan Field of view: 45  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old woman with B PE, ?
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is right lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
Contrast material was present within the kidneys from the patient's recent contrast-enhanced CT scan.
Correlation with the patient's history and mammogram is recommended.
Further evaluation with an ultrasound or MRI could also be performed to further characterize this lesion.
MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST  [**2165-10-17**] 1:30 PM  MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST  Reason: please perform MRV of HEPATIC VEINS to evaulate for clot/sou Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old woman 4 weeks s/p lap Chole with known PE & subcapsular hematoma.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar MR imaging of the abdomen was performed, including 2D time-of-flight images through the hepatic veins.
Evaluation of 3D acquired volumetric images of the abdomen is degraded by motion.
Interventional radiology was consulted for the subcapsular hepatic hematoma noted on abdominal CT imaging; a percutaneous drainage catheter was placed.
Gram stain was negative.
She will be discharged to home with the catheter in place and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks for repeat abdominal CT scan.
Inform the office that you will need to have an abdominal CT scan of your abdomen to assess the fluid collection and that this needs to be compared to previous CT of your abdomen.
