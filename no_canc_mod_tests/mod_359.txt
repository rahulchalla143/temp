ECG [**8-19**] Atrial fibrillation 94bpm.
CXR [**8-19**]: IMPRESSION: Right mid to lower lung opacity concerning for pneumonia.
Echo [**8-20**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-2-18**], significant systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle are now both present.
CXR [**8-20**]: Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
The lateral CP angles were not included on the film.
Repeat TTE [**2201-8-24**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-8-20**], the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are slightly reduced.
His SOB and CXR improved with diuresis.
On admission, he had a CXR suggestive of pulmonary edema so was diuresed on a Lasix drip overnight in the MICU, with follow-up CXR showing resolution of the edema and lung exam free of rales.
Past echos had shown diastolic failure with preserved EF, but echo on this admission showed new systolic failure with EF of 30%.
Afib/History of PE & DVT/anticoagulation: The patient suffers from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and also has a history of PE and DVTs.
He was admitted with supratherapeutic INR of 4.7, so warfarin was initially held, then restarted at half dose on [**8-21**] and full dose on [**8-22**].
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
