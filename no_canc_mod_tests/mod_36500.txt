Her O2 sats improved to 90% on 4L NC.
CXR showed no infiltrate.
ABG notable for 7.35/85/65 on 6L NC.
WBC of 15.3 with 92% Neutrophils.
BNP of [**2106**].

CXR in ED: Again is noted bilateral oligemia with relative hyperlucency in both upper lung zones consistent with patient's known history of emphysema.
Chest CT [**4-8**]: As compared to the previous examination of [**2106-11-17**], there is no relevant change.
TTE [**4-8**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CTA chest [**2107-5-7**]: 1.
CXR without infiltrate, pt.
Initial ABG showed hypercarbia with pCO2 85 and elevated bicarb suggestive of acute on chronic resp.
Continued supplemental O2 for goal sat >90%.
On d/c will need pulmonology followup as outpatient as well as outpatient PFTs and consideration of testing for alpha 1 antitrypsin.
However, given her hypoxia and tachycardia, CTA was done which showed a small subsegmental PE.
Heparin gtt was started as bridge to INR [**2-13**] with coumadin.
Her INR was 2.8 on day of discharge, and she is set up with home VNA to monitor INR.
We had spent an extensive amount of time with the patient teaching her about risks associated with taking coumadin and the importance of following INR closely.
