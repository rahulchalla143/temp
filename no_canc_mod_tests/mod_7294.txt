He was found to have a total bilirubin of 1.9, ast 71 and alt of 76; also with elevated white blood cell count of 18.6.
Patient had an abdominal CT scan on admission which showed fluid in the colon consistent with enteritis vs colitis.
Stool was negative for C.difficile.
GI (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted, reviewed the CT scan with radiology - stable dilation of the CBD compared to [**2102**] and [**2101**] with dilation all the way to the ampulla and no intraluminal abnormality/stone seen; also with stable segmental intrahepatic dilation that appears to be related to previous liver surgery.
Per patient's request was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Of note total bilirubin decreased to 1.1 but ALT increased from 76 to 102. .
An x-ray was done at [**Hospital3 3583**] which showed healing fractures of the right 8th and 9th ribs (patient had presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2106-7-26**] after falling out of a broken chair and elbow pushing into right chest wall - pa/lat cxr at the time did not reveal any rib fractures; rib pain had resided two weeks ago).
Given patient's significant cardiac history he was monitored on telemetry at [**Hospital3 3583**] without any significant events and ruled out for AMI with 4 sets of negative troponins.
CTA of chest was done which was negative for pulmonary embolism (had a positive d-dimer).

Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
CT scan at OSH was compatible with diagnosis of acute colitis vs enteritis, although patient's complaint of diarrhea appears to be more chronic and may warrant further outpatient evaluation.
Abdominal ultrasound, stool studies were negative including repeat cdiff toxin although cdiff pcr was still pending at the time of discharge.
Etiology of arrhythmia was unclear: CTA negative for PE at OSH, TSH within normal limitis, ruled out for cardiac ischemia although echo showed biventricular dysfunction.
Electrophysiology was consulted to interrogate pacemaker and found that mode switch off device was tracking atrial flutter with resultant ventricular rate of 120-130 bpm.
healing from injury in [**2106-7-26**] and if so unclear why pain improved and is now worsening; PE ruled out by negative CTA; no evidence of PNA; ROMI negative at OSH and at [**Hospital1 18**], making ischemia unlikely.
Leukocytosis: likely due to infectious colitis as further infectious evaluation negative including blood, urine and stool cultures.
CAD/HTN:  As above, no signs of active ischemia per EKG and serial cardiac enzymes.
