Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %) secondary to akinesis of the entire interventricular septum, anterior free wall, inferior free wall, and apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-2-19**], left ventricular contractile function is markedly further decreased; mitral regurgitation is significantly increased.
[**Year (4 digits) **] [**2170-6-23**]: LVEF 20%, moderate 2+ MR. [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**2170-6-25**]: RV systolic function appear slightly worse, LEVF 25%, 3+ MR. [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**2170-6-27**]: RV function appears slightly improved and estimated pulmonary artery pressure is lower.
LVEF 20-25%, 3+ MR.  [**Month/Day/Year **] [**2170-6-29**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-6-27**], LV systolic dysfunction remains severely depressed.
ECG on admission [**2170-6-19**]: Sinus rhythm.
ECG [**2170-6-28**]: Sinus rhythm.
CXR on admission [**2170-6-19**]: Allowing for differences in patient positioning, large left and moderate right pleural effusions are not substantially changed.
CXR [**2170-6-26**]: Progression of venous congestion with moderately large bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 82F s/p NSTEMI [**2-/2170**] with stent to LAD who presented with worsening CHF, echo demonstrated significant worsening in LV function (LVEF 15%, most recent EF=20-25% [**6-27**]) and MR, s/p cardiac catheterization [**2170-6-21**] which revealed in-stent restenosis of proximal LAD and worsened atherosclerotic disease of left main stem.
Echo on day of admission revealed diminished LVEF for 15% and moderate 3+ MR.  Cardiac cath on [**2170-6-21**] revealed 90% instent restenosis of the LAD stent as well as left main disease, and the patient underwent impella-supported PCI on [**2170-6-22**] with stenting of left main.
Repeat echo [**2170-6-22**] showed improved LVEF of 20% and reduced MR, 2+.
She later developed acute renal failure post-procedure with anuria likely due to a combination of low BP and contrast induced nephropathy requiring CVVH for which she was dependent.
Her SBP was consistently low with SBP in 80s and was closely monitord.
She started heparin gtt ([**6-28**]) for both for her cardiac hypokinesis and any potential arterial embolism of her left leg after her INR decreased to subtherapeutic levels.
By [**6-29**], her SBP ropped into tteh 70s and norepinephrine wa restarted although her [**Month/Year (2) **] limbs became worse and her BP was only able to be maintained in the high 70s/low 80s.
On [**6-29**] after discussion with her family, she was made for comfort measures only and an echo on [**6-29**] revealed a significantly decreased LVEF of only 10-15%, in addition to worse RV systolic function.
# CAD: The patient had an NSTEMI in [**2-/2170**] s/p L THR surgery, and it was thought that an [**Year (4 digits) **] cardiomyopathy may be the etiology for her current presentation.
There was a question of whether her LAD stent had thrombosed, given significant worsening of LV function (EF 30-35% in [**2170-2-19**] to EF of 15% on admission [**6-19**]).
The patient underwent a cardiac cath on [**2170-6-21**] to evaluate her coronary arteries, which revealed 90% in-stent restenosis in the proximal LAD, worsened atheresclerotic disease of the left main (ostial 70% left main lesion), and complete occlusion of the RCA with the distal RCA perfused via collaterals.
She was placed on heaprin drip after her INR became subtherapeutic on [**6-28**].
# Hypotension - BP was hypotensive on admission, likely multifactorial and secondary to diuresis, anti-hypertensives and poor CO.  SBP range generally 70s-90s with several SBP readings as low as 60s following administration of IV metoprolol which was held on most of the admission.
Her BP was also felt to be contributory to her acute renal failuer which occurred post-cath and was felt to be in combination with contrast-induced nephropathy following two catheterisations and a high contrast burden.
Pulses in the feet were intermittently present on doppler in the right foot and absent on the left but this also varied as to being detectable.
CK levels were trended in case of compartment syndrome following re-perfusion injury but generally decreased.
The AST/ALT levels were 182/174 respectively, and not remarkable enough for [**Month/Year (2) **] liver.
We trended electrolytes and repleted as needed.
?observed on physical exam on [**6-27**].
We followed up blood cultures and continue to trend WBC which was trending down.
# Confirmation of death - Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 714**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2170-6-30**] Called to see patient at 0216.
Telemetry monitor reveals asystole.
