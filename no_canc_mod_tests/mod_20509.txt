At the OSH, an abnormality was noted on an imaging study and he was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 2+ radial, DP and PT pulses b/l.
Fundoscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages; venous pulsations present.
Sensation intact to light touch over face.
Pertinent Results: Radiologic Data: CT head (performed at OSH): roughly 3 cm in diameter right parietooccipital hemorrhage, which appears acute (reviewed with radiologist on call).
[**10-4**] Brain MRI: TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained.
CT EXAMINATION OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST, AND WITH ORAL CONTRAST:  INDICATION: 69-year-old male with right parietal lobe bleed.
FINDINGS: No prior CT examination for comparison.
Evaluation of the lungs reveals a 6 mm calcified nodule within the right upper lobe (series 3, image 21).
Evaluation of the mediastinum reveals calcified lymph nodes, likely from prior granulomatous disease.
HISTORY: 69-year-old man with previous MRI revealing a hemorrhage in the right parietooccipital lobe and mass concerning for metastases.
MRA did not reveal  any abnormal vasculature in this area and a body CT was unrevealing as far as a primary neoplastic process.
INTERPRETATION: Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections and no focal abnormal uptake or penia was noted.
FINDINGS: Targeted ultrasound examination of the thyroid demonstrates normal thyroid parenchyma, without evidence of nodule or mass.
MRI revealed enhancement underneath the bleed concerning for mass.
Therefore, metastatic work-up performed which included CT torso (normal except for thickened esophagus, enlarged prostate), thyroid scan (normal).
In addition, LP performed and CSF cytology negative for malignant cells.
He was evaluated by both neurooncology and neurosurgery who recommended repeat CT scan and follow-up in one month.
Blood loss anemia: The pt had progressively declining Hct over the hospital stay.
Colonoscopy was deferred given negative colonoscopy several months prior and non-bleeding duodenal ulcer found of EGD.
Renal failure: On admission, the pt had a creatinine of 1.1.
He did receive a dye load for CT torso, but was medicated with mucormyst.
Attempts were made to obtain outside records to determine baseline creatinine (given h/o diabetes and HTN, likely preexisting nephropathy).
HTN: BP was elevated on admission.
He was maintained on glyburide and a sliding scale of regular insulin.
