CXR with small right effusion and elevated R hemidiaphragm but no pneuamonia.
Admission Cr was 2.6 which rose to 3.3 on the day of transfer with associated hyperkalemia (K up to 6 without reported ekg changes) and oliguria.
Renal was consulted and diuretics were held and albumin challenge given, with no improvement in renal function.
The patient's family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] since Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] is here and she is currently being [**Last Name (STitle) 6349**] for a repeat liver transplant.
VS prior to transfer were 99.0, 95/32, 70, 17, 96% on 4LNC (uses 2L at home).

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-5-21**], the right ventricle is more dilated and the tricuspid regurgitation is increased.
Blood cultures, urine cultures, CXRs, and peritoneal fluid were all negative.
An echocardiogram revealed a more dilated right ventricle and worsening tricuspid regurgitation, however normal LVEF.
Creatinine upon admission to OSH was 2.6 which peaked at 5.9.
Renal U/S was negative for obstruction.
# Anemia: HCT remained in the low to mid 20s throughout her hospitalization.
An MRI torso was negative for any spinal or other acute process.
# Goals of care: After learning that she is not a candidate for another liver transplant, and given her renal and liver failure, the decision was made to focus on comfort.
