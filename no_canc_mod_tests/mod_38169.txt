HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, acute renal failure on hemodialysis, MRSA, recently discharged after CLO urosepsis and [**Female First Name (un) **] fungemia in [**2161-3-23**], now admitted with left parotitis, increased white blood cell count and microangiopathic blood smear.
Patient was afebrile at nursing home with stable blood pressure and oxygen sats.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.1, 85, 110/41, 16 and 91% on room air.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 25.2, hematocrit 32.9, platelet count 352,000, 79% neutrophils, 7 bands, 8 lymphs, 3 monos, 1 meta and 2 myelo.
Chemistry, sodium 138, potassium 4.9, chloride 106, CO2 23, BUN 10, creatinine 1.7 and glucose 154.
CT of the neck showed enlarged left parotid gland associated prominently with lymphadenopathy, airway intact.
A urinalysis returned on the 7th indicative of infection.
Later blood and urine cultures were found to grow out gram negative rods resistant to Ceftaz and Levofloxacin.
Subsequently on the 9th the patient was found to be hypotensive with blood pressures 60/palp.
After third liter of normal saline patient's blood pressure was still only in the 70's, pulse 60, respiratory rate 16 and 96% on three liters nasal cannula.
It was decided to take patient to MICU this evening secondary to new onset of bilateral pulmonary crackles on exam which previously had been clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Subsequent urine cultures, blood cultures, and sputum cultures were negative.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound and LFTs were within normal limits except for an isolated, elevated alkaline phosphatase.
CT was unable to be completed to look for abscess formation secondary to patient's instability.
The patient's creatinine remained stable status post discontinuation of hemodialysis.
A thoracentesis was done to tap patient's left sided pleural effusion which revealed a transudate consistent with congestive heart failure.
Therefore, a transthoracic echo was repeated which revealed an EF of 60-70%, possibly diastolic dysfunction, RV dilation and systolic dysfunction.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  As above, patient with significant hypervolemia.
