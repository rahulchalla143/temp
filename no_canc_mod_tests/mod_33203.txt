The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-6-12**], the aortic valve gradient is now slightly higher and left ventricular systolic function is now slightly less vigorous.
Pt also found to be hypoxic with O2 =85 on RA in the ED, and CXR suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
He had no further episodes of vomiting and diet was advanced to his home diet of ground solids and thick liquids- which he tolerated well.
CXR revealed some pulm edema.
After diuresis with lasix (20-40mg/day IV lasix for 2 days), pt's sats improved to 95% on RA.
LFTs were checked: AST 43, ALT 15. .
Critical AS: Echo on this admission reveals severe/critical AS (valve area 0.8) with worsening valve gradient and decreased EF 70-->50%.
