At the outside hospital, the patient was found to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressure to the 70s, hyperkalemic with potassium of 6.9, digitoxin toxic level of 2.9, and acute renal failure with BUN and creatinine of 96/10, and coagulopathic with an [**Year (4 digits) 263**] of 8.9.
Patient at that admission was diuresed with Lasix [**Hospital1 **] with good result and discharged on [**7-5**] with a BUN and creatinine of 20/1.1.
At the outside hospital, patient underwent a renal ultrasound which was negative for hydronephrosis or other acute process.
Patient was also given D50 +10 units of insulin, 1 amp of sodium bicarb, Kayexalate, 1 amp of calcium gluconate, all for his hyperkalemia.
Patient was also bolused with normal saline and put on a dopamine drip as well as a dobutamine drip for his low systolic blood pressure to the 70s.
Patient was also given 1 amp of Digibind for his digoxin level of 2.6.
Patient's repeat potassium was 5.6 at the outside hospital.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], the patient's systolic blood pressure decreased to the 60s while in the parking lot, so his dopamine drip was increased to 5 mcg/kg/minute.
Ejection fraction greater than 55% one year ago, reportedly 25-30% by the outside hospital.
Coreg 6.25 3x a day.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate of 70, blood pressure 95/37, MAP of 57, oxygen saturation of 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula, temperature 98.6, respiratory rate 14.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, mild expiratory wheezes.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Complete blood count:  White blood cell count 11.4, hematocrit 33.7, platelets of 157, MCV 90.
Coagulation:  PT 41.4, [**Year (4 digits) 263**] 11.3, PTT 43.3.
Electrolytes:  Sodium 127, potassium 5.1, chloride 91, bicarb 19, BUN 97, creatinine 10, glucose 129, calcium 8.6, phosphate 5.1, magnesium 2.2.
Anion gap 17.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  A-V paced at 70, increased artifact, but no peaked T waves.
Given patient's chest tightness in the parking lot, cardiac enzymes were sent and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction.
The patient was monitored closely for signs of pulmonary edema as his ejection fraction was suspected to be low.
Blood and urine cultures were also sent to rule out an infection, although the patient did not have fever, cough, or other symptoms or signs of infection.
All cultures were negative at the time of discharge.
Patient's norepinephrine drip was tapered and stopped, and the patient's systolic blood pressure remained in the 100-115 range.
The patient was initially considered for possible dialysis at admission, however, his potassium and other electrolytes on repeat had improved markedly.
An echocardiogram performed at the bedside in the Medical Intensive Care Unit revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, no aortic or mitral regurgitation, no pericardial effusion.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient maintained on a renal, cardiac diet, which was tolerated well throughout his hospital stay.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Patient is scheduled to be transferred to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further workup in the inpatient medicine floor.
