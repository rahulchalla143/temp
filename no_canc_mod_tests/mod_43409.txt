Post OP labs revealed a potassium of 6.7 and the patient was emergently dialyzed in the ICU where she had been transferred.
The heart rate stabilized and she was switched to home dose amiodarone PO and also home dose metoprolol.
Vital signs remained stable, enzymes were cycled and negative, EKG revealed AFib with RVR.
Initial urine output was poor with less than 50 cc daily for the first 4 days.
Creatinine was 6.5 then 6.6 prior to discharge without HD so appeared to be stabilizing.
FK level on discharge was 11.6 and dose was dropped to 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Additionally, her coumadin was restarted prior to discharge as it was determined there would not be a kidney biopsy due to following INRs as he was prior to transplant.
Due to AFib, a TSH was sent which came back low at .2, however the free T4 and T4 were WNL.
