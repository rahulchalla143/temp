He was also given Abx for abnormalities on a Chest CXR/CT, although he had no clinical signs of PNA and radiology reports described the posterior left base opacity as likely atelectasis.
Repeat ECHO done at [**Hospital1 **] showed a moderate effusion (report not available) which had evolved within 5 days--reportedly not concerning for tamponade.
No pulsus on exam with BP 95-105/50-60.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgt.
Of note, co-synotropin testing at [**Hospital1 **] showed that pt is adrenally insufficient s/p distant unilateral adrenalectomy after which he never followed up with an endocrinologist.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: -Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, -Hypertension  2.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
If clinically indicated, serial evaluation is suggested .
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Etiology unknown, negative evaluation most consistent with viral infection.
Preliminary ECHO without tamponade physiology.
A repeat echocardiogram 2 days later showed decrease in size of the pericardial effusion.
At time of discharge, patient had no further recurrence of chest discomfort, dyspnea, lightheadedness or other symptoms consistent with pericarditis/ pericardial effusion.
He underwent thoracentesis on [**11-28**], with fluid studies revealing an exudative effusion.
The gram stain was initially reported as having 2+ GNRs and 3+ PMNs.
Several hours later, though, the microbiology lab reported an error in their reporting, stating that nothing had grown on culture and that there were actually no micro-organisms seen.
The patient was initially treated empirically with vancomycin and ceftriaxone to cover a purulent pericarditis, which was later changed to ceftriaxone for the erroneously-reported positive gram stain on the pleural fluid (see above).
He will need thyroid function tests rechecked in [**3-6**] weeks.
You will need another echocardiogram by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**] when you see him in [**Month (only) 404**].
