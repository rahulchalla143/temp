Under ultrasound guidance, the right basilic vein was identified and punctured with 21-gauge needle after administration of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.
A final chest x-ray was obtained.
A StatLock was applied and the line was hep-locked.

Aspiration after the swallow was due pharyngeal residue and uncle[**Name (NI) **] penetration in the laryngeal vestibule dripping below the level of the cords.
All episodes of aspiration and penetration were silent, without throat clearing or coughing.
The chin tuck and repeat swallows did not reduce the penetration/aspiration or reduce the amount of pharyngeal residue.
Pt continues to have trace-mild amounts of aspiration with both thin and nectar thick liquids, noted to increase secondary to [**Name (NI) 57714**] throughout the study.
Pt has demonstrated some improvement since the last study 4 days ago, but since it is unclear if his weakness is secondary to deconditioning or a new stroke, would recommend that the video swallow be repeated in [**7-3**] days to look for improvement and to see if pt can be advanced to a PO diet from trials.
Suggested to repeat video swallow in [**7-3**] days to look      for improvement to attempt advancing to full PO diet.
The cross clamp was 100 mins., total bypass time 128 mins.
On POD#1 he was extubated and his chest tubes were d/c'd.
His voice was very hoarse post op and a swallow study was obtained.
He was transferred to the floor on POD#2 and he had a repeat swallow evaluation on POD#4 which showed improvement, but the patient still needs tube feedings and can only have limited ice chips.
