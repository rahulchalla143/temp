Althought this is not documented in recent discharge summary, apparently patient has been using oxygen for the last month since her most recent discharge, and using 2L while sleeping and ambulating.
In the ED, patient was initially found to have a room air sat of 75% which came up with 5 L of oxygen to 88%.
BNP was 21,602 from an older value of 11,653 in [**Month (only) **].
CXR was consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
Initial cardiac enzymes were elevated with a troponin of 0.13, with a baseline of 0.04 to 0.76 given he renal function.
EKG demonstrated lateral ST changes and an old Q wave inferiorly.
On transfer, VS were 99, 95, 229/79, 24, and 95% on 4l.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2159-12-18**], pulmonary pressures are higher.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2160-4-24**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.
Venograms were performed over the wire using carbon dioxide of the fistula centrally, sequentially.
CXR was consistent with volume overload given interstitial edema and bilateral effusions.
Troponin was at relative baseline given her renal dysfunction and remained stable, though EKG did show some signs of demand.
TTE on [**4-24**] demonstrated normal LV systolic function (LVEF >55%), trace AR and mild MR, as well as moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Admission weight was 76.2 kg with dry weight of 73.9 kg.
Discharge weight was 71.2 kg.
# Malignant hypertension ICU course: SBP in 200s on initial presentation to ED.
Her blood pressure was treated aggressively with nitro gtt titrated to SBP 180-200.
Her labetolol was uptitrated to 400 mg PO TID.
She will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] and her PCP for further titration of regimen.
AV fistulogram performed on [**2160-4-28**] showing two focal tight stenoses within long stent which extended from left subclavian to SVC and band-like stenosis at cephalic arch s/p balloon angioplasty with post-procedural venograms demonstrating resolution of band-like stenosis and improvement of stenoses within long stent.
A total of 50 mL of contrast was used.
Her sodium bicarbonate was decreased from 1300 mg PO BID to 650 mg PO BID.
