The substernal chest pain lasted several hours and at the Emergency Department the patient was found to have no significant changes in EKG from her prior EKGs; however, she was found to have elevated troponins with a maximum value of 24.49 and peak CK to 857 and peak CK MB value of 73.8.
She was sent to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for this non ST elevation, elevated MI which showed a left ventricular function with ejection fraction of 50% showing inferior wall hypokinesis, patent saphenous vein graft to the occluded LAD and occluded native LAD, occluded circumflex bypass graft with multiple plaques and occluded dominant RCA graft of multiple severe stenosis.
Latest study on [**2194-8-21**] showed 25-49% stenosis of the right internal carotid assessed to be stable and minimally changed from the prior study in [**2193-6-8**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  T maximum of 100.1, heart rate 67, blood pressure 141/67, respiratory rate 18, saturating at 94% on room air.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation except for mild crackles at the bases bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, the white count was 14.1 with neutrophils 71%, 10% bands, 40% lymphocytes, hematocrit 43.5, platelets 229,000.
Chemistries:  Sodium 140, potassium 4.2, chloride 104, C02 25, BUN 13, creatinine 0.9, glucose 88, AST 59, ALT 19, alkaline phosphatase 179, total protein 6.9 with an albumin of 3.7.
PT/PTT 11.7/44.5 with an INR of 1.1.
CKs initially on presentation to [**Hospital 12017**] [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital was 803, 821, 857, 649 with MB fraction of 76.1, 51.1, 73.8, and 55.8 respectively.
Troponin levels were 18.6, 6.24, 24.49, 24.38.
Laboratories on admission to [**Hospital1 **] revealed a white count of 12.8, hematocrit 37.7, platelets 184,000.
PT/PTT 12.0 and 42.0 with an INR of 1.0.
Sodium 142, potassium 3.9, chloride 106, C02 25, BUN 13, creatinine 0.8, and glucose of 82.
CKs done at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] was 254 and 229 with an MB fraction of 87, troponin 1.24 and 1.24.
The U/A done at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] showed 0-2 WBCs and occasional bacteria, nitrates negative, leukocyte esterase negative, protein 30, and RBCs [**11-27**].
EKG done at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] in comparison to prior EKGs showed a new left bundle branch block.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiology and Interventional Cardiology staff were consulted and the cardiac catheterization films from [**Hospital 12017**] Hospital were read with the saphenous vein graft to LAD with 40% stenosis, saphenous vein graft to RCA/PDA with 90% stenosis, saphenous vein graft to OM with complete occlusion.
The blood pressures were stable off of all drips.
The blood pressure was well controlled on p.o.
