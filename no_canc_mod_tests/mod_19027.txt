EMS reports that the patient's pacemaker did not appear to be functioning adequately as they found the patient's heart rate to be between the 30's and 70's.
The patient was bradycardic and a CXR demonstrated a displaced right ventricular pacer wire.
After consultation with the family, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
A repeat ECHO demonstrated no effusion or complication of lead placement.
Pulmonary edema, diastolic dysfunction 17. complete heart block.

[**2161-3-2**] pCXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-2**], the new right ventricular lead appears to be in good position, substantially less peripheral than on the previous study.
ECHO [**2161-3-2**] Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular pacing lead is identified in the right ventricular cavity.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study of earlier in the day, the right ventricular pacing lead no longer appears to extend beyond the free wall (though views are focused).
ECHO [**2161-3-1**] Normal right ventricular cavity size and free wall motino.
MICROBIOLOGY: [**2161-3-2**] 4:30 pm URINE     Site: NOT SPECIFIED      HEM# 1646E [**3-2**].
URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
**FINAL REPORT [**2161-3-3**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2161-3-3**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
An echo here demonstrated no pericardial effusion, but showed clear perforation of the RV lead.
She underwent RV lead revision, with post-operative echo showing no complication.
Repeat Echo demonstrates only minimal pericardial fluid, but no evidence of tamponade.
Patient was monitored on telemetry and with serial EKG without additional complication.
Cr was 1.7 on admission.
Culture grew > 100k E.coli with sensitivities pending.
# Transitions: - E.coli sensitivities from urine culture pending - spoke with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
You had an echocardiogram which showed no complication.
