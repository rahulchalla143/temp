He was taken to [**Hospital3 **] and his EKG revealed STE in anterolateral leads.
He was given ASA, nitro gtt, morphine, heparin, IV lopressor 10 mg, NS, plavix 600, lipitor 80, and KCl 40.
CXR normal.
[**Hospital1 18**] cath revealed normal hemodynamics, 99% LAD lesion with thrombus s/p thrombectomy.

Cardiac cath [**2145-9-7**] Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel CAD.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal left and right sided filling pressures.
Echo [**2145-9-8**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; anterior apex - akinetic; septal apex- akinetic; inferior apex - akinetic; apex - dyskinetic; remaining LV segments contract normally.
EF 35%  Brief Hospital Course: 43 y/o male with h/o HTN who presented to OSH with STEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and management.
Cardiac/Ischemia/Pump The patient was found to have an STEMI at OSH and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and management.
He was transferred to the CCU post-cath on a nitro gtt for further monitoring and management.
He was continuously monitored on telemetry.
He had an echo performed the next day after cath which revealed apical akinesis and he was started on a heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus formation.
He will need to have his INR followed as an outpatient by his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will continue Lovenox until INR is in target range.
He will need another echo for evaluation of cardiac function in approximately 6 months.
Cholesterol levels were sent and the results are above.
Due to patient's age and relative lack of risk factors, a urine tox screen was sent and was negative for cocaine.
Further risk stratification will be performed as an outpatient.
He will need outpatient cardiac rehab coordinated by his PCP.
His HCT remained stable throughout admission and started to trend upward.
Iron studies revealed normal iron level, TIBC of 263, Ferritin 308.
Outpatient Lab Work INR check on [**2145-9-13**] Please go to your primary care doctor's office or a local laboratory to get your blood drawn.
