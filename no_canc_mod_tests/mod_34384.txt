Admission Date:  [**2102-12-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-1-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2030-9-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**] Chief Complaint: worsening shortness of breath, recurrent pericardial effusion found on routine echo  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial window ([**2102-12-28**])   History of Present Illness: 72M with PMH of DM, AFib on coumadin, and RA complicated by pericardial effusion and tamponade in [**5-6**], transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] for further evaluation and management of recurrent pericardial effusion and tamponade seen on routine repeat echo.
Found to have pericardial effusion, underwent pericardiocentesis with removal 300 cc clear slightly blood-tinged pericardial fluid, with decrease in pericardial pressure from 26 to 10 mmHg.
Pericardial fluid culture and cytology returned negative.
Fluid analysis revealed WBC# 6100 (81% PMN), RBC [**Numeric Identifier 83167**] TP 5.1 albumin 2.9 gluc 4 LDH 4230.
Routine follow-up TTE today at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] showed a small to moderate mainly anterior pericardial effusion with diastolic right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade.
Transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management, where triage V/S 98 125 138/83 18 94%RA.
Labs notable for INR 3.7, Hct 30.5.
EKG showed low voltage in the limb leads.
CXR showed only bibasilar linear atelectasis.
Vital signs prior to transfer 95 132/87 20 97%RA.
Physical Exam: VS: T 98.2, BP 128/84, HR 97, RR 18, SO2 100% RA, Pulsus 5-7mmHg GENERAL: WDWN male in NAD.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal.
ECHO [**2102-12-30**] GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal although views are technically suboptimal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-5-26**], the pericardial effusion is now smaller.
AP Chest [**2102-12-31**] Study is limited as the lung bases have been excluded from the field of view.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2102-12-25**] 6:28 PM UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
CXR [**2103-1-1**] IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous opacification at both lung bases has improved since [**12-30**], probably atelectasis.
Patient has been receiving regular follow up with his cardiologist with a repeat echo every 6 weeks.
His echo read done at [**Location (un) 620**] showed a small to moderate mainly anterior pericardial effusion with evidence of diastolic right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade.
An additional read done by cardiology service here showed small amount of fluid with no evidence of RV diastolic collapse.
The drainage tube was subsequently removed and he is being followed with serial imaging which at the time of discharge showed a smaller pericardial effusion on echo and only atelectasis on CXR.
Fluid culture was positive for propionobacterium acnes which was felt to be a contaminant.
Biopsy from pericardial window showed unremarkable cartilage and skeletal muscle and fragments of pericardium with chronic inflammation and fibrin deposition.
A fib - patient takes warfarin at home, was found to be supratherapeutic at INR of 3.7 on admission.
INR was reversed for the pericardial window.
He was bridged on heparin drip to coumadin and the coumadin alone was continued once his INR was therapeutic.
An outpatient colonoscopy can be considered as an outpatient.
Rheumatoid Arthritis - patient's home regimen of methotrexate was held for pericardial effusion.
During this admission, we reviewed the echocardiogram that was performed at [**Location (un) 620**] and found that while there is some fluid present, it is not causing any tamponade of your heart.
A pericardial window was performed by thoracic surgery to help drain the fluid around your heart and prevent future reaccumulation.
If you experience any chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, or any other worrisome symptoms, please return to the emergency room  Followup Instructions: #1.MD: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1026**] [**Name (STitle) 1016**] Specialty: Cardiology Date/ Time: [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**1-5**] at 10:00am Location: [**Street Address(2) **], [**Location (un) 620**], [**Numeric Identifier 3002**] Phone number: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8937**] .
#4.Please go to [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] [**Location (un) **] Radiology on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for a Chest X-ray, any time between 9am and 3pm on [**2103-1-13**].
This chest x-ray must be done before your appointment with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] on the 19th.
