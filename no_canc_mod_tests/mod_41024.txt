Pt took an imitrex because she thought her sx were related to a migraine, and when neither her weakness or her HA improved by 10:30am, she called 911.
EMS noted her FS was normal (but we don't have report of the exact number), her BP was 130/90 and her HR was 87.
She had a head CT that showed a 2x4cm ICH in the R basal ganglia.
She was noted to be normotensive throughout her ED stay, but given the CT findings she was then helicoptered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
No bleeding disorder, strokes or seizures run in the family   Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vitals: T:98.2  P: 78  R: 18  BP 129/79, 100%RA GENERAL: Somnolent but easily arousable, intermittently tearful HEENT: no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.

CT Head ([**2145-8-21**]): parenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right lentiform nucleus  CT Head Follow up with CTA ([**2145-8-22**]): 1.
An aneurysm is less likely, but a follow-up CTA in one year is recommended for reassessment.
Her neurological examination was significant for somnolence/lethargy without deficits in naming, language or speech, significant arm>leg/face weakness with a mild left facial droop with pronator drift on the left, and complete hemisensory loss over the left arm with deficits in proprioception, vibration sense and pinprick sensation.
Her NCHCT showed a parenchymal bleed in the right lentiform nucleus and a simutaneous CT angiogram revealed no obvious aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations.
She was admitted to the neuro-intensive care unit where overnight she remained hemodynamically stable, and her blood pressures remained under excellent control.
Her urine toxicology studies were positive for cocaine metabolites, and while she initially denied taking cocaine, she later admitted to recreational use of cocaine.
She passed a simple bedside swallow evaluation and she tolerated a regular diet without complications.
It is essential that the patient be examined by a neurologist within 2 months of discharge with an MRI w/wo contrast.

Cocaine causes blood vessel constriction, which increases blood pressure causing vessel damage.
- To prevent further brain hemorrhages and other complications of cocaine such as heart attacks, extreme elevations in blood pressure and depression, we strongly recommend that you abstain from cocaine completely.
Prior to your appointment with him/her, we would like for you to get an MRI with/without contrast for their review.
