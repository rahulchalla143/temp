She was then stable with good oxygen saturation on room air.
Hematocrit was monitored closely and was noted to trend downward slowly.
She received 1U PRBC on [**9-21**] and another on [**9-22**], but her hematocrit failed to bump appropriately both times.

Urine output did not initially improve as much as the BP and creatinine did with fluids, but eventually it did recover as well, particularly after transfusions of PRBC were given (as above), which helped to replete intravascular volume status.
Creatinine remained stable around 0.8-0.9 at the time of discharge.
