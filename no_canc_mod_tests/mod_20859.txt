At the outside hospital, the patient's laboratory data was notable for a platelet count of 7, INR 1.2, and large blood on a urinalysis.
An abdominal computerized tomography scan was performed which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis, no renal stones and a cyst in the right kidney.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination temperature was 99.7, heart rate 104, blood pressure 123/83, respirations 10, oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Oropharynx is clear.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Sensation is intact to light touch throughout.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 18.2, hematocrit 35.4, platelets 13, MCV 79.
Chemistries, sodium 138, potassium 3.9, chloride 104, bicarbonate 28, BUN 38, creatinine 1.2, glucose 158, anion gap of 14, ALT 18, AST 46, alkaline phosphatase 120, amylase 33, total bilirubin 2.2, lipase 35, albumin 3.6.
PT 13.5, PTT 21.1, INR 1.2.
Urinalysis:  Red, protein over 300, trace glucose, moderate bilirubin, red blood cells over 50, white blood cells [**3-1**], few bacteria.
Heme - The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] from an outside hospital with a platelet count of 7 there and 13 on admission here.
The patient had stool cultures sent which were negative for Escherichia coli and Shigella.
Her heme studies were consistent with a hemolytic anemia in addition to her thrombocytopenia.
The patient underwent five cycles of plasmapheresis which were uncomplicated and her platelet count eventually increased to 244.
During the patient's sixth plasmapheresis she experienced hives on her face and upper chest which were treated with Benadryl and steroids.
The patient was given an additional intravenous dose of Benadryl and 200 mg of Hydrocortisone and was noted to have an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air.
The patient was placed on 5 liters of nonrebreather and her oxygen saturations increased only to 93%.
The patient's platelet count remained relatively stable for several days in the MICU and the hematology service recommended Rituximib which the patient received on [**2120-3-27**].
The patient's platelet count subsequently increased with subsequent plasmapheresis.
Respiratory failure - As noted earlier, the patient became acutely short of breath with expiratory grunting and paradoxical breathing patterns during her seventh plasmapheresis and was urgently transferred to the Emergency Department where she was intubated.
Septic shock - The patient was noted on transfer to the MICU to be in septic shock requiring pressors and large fluid boluses.
She had blood, urine and sputum cultures which are all negative to date.
Her lactate level and metabolic acidosis improved through her extended stay in the MICU and she had an improving white blood cell count with increased bandemia.
Once stable, the patient was taken for a chest and abdominal computerized tomography scan on [**2120-3-26**] for continuing low-grade fevers.
This computerized tomography scan revealed no nidus of infection.
On transfer to the MICU the patient's Apache score was calculated at 31 and a trial of Xigris was considered but was eventually not used secondary to the patient's DIC.
Acute renal failure - The patient was admitted to the General Medical Service with a creatinine of 1.2, felt likely secondary to her thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
On transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit after the Code Blue, the patient's creatinine was 2.2 and eventually increased to 4.4.
Over the course of her stay in the MICU the patient has had modest improvement in her creatinine and a gradual increase in her urine output.
Cardiovascular - In the setting of the patient's Trali and septic shock her cardiac enzymes were noted to bump.
The patient had a peak creatinine kinase of 1001 which eventually trended down and a peak troponin of 0.92 which also trended down.
As noted earlier, the patient was acutely hypotensive in septic shock and was placed on Levophed and Vasopressin for maintenance of her blood pressures.
Gastrointestinal - In the setting of the patient's septic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome, her liver enzymes became elevated.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was started on tube feeds on her second day in the MICU which she tolerated at goal.
Her electrolytes were repleted aggressively.
