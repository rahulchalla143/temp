Per OMR, he was neurology service in [**10-3**] for evaluation of a similar episode, involving dysarthria and truncal ataxia.
He was diagnosed with Vitamin B12 deficiency (for which he continues treatment) and a probable midline cerebellar stroke, although MRI imaging could not be obtained due to the pacemaker.
Past Medical History: *CABG (quadruple bypass) in [**2083**] *Stents placed in 3 coronary arteries *Pacer/Defibrillator Implant  Most recent echo [**2101-10-4**]: Ejection Fraction 25-30% The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2101-5-31**], septal motion is less vigorous and the distal septum and apical dysfunction are now apparent c/w interim ischemia.

Rest  of exam was limited due to his difficulty hearing.
Remainder of strength exam was [**5-4**].
Sensory: Sensation is difficult to assess in this patient, but there appears to be diminished sensation to light touch, temperature, and pin prick in the distal hands and feet.
Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2102-7-2**] TECHNIQUE: CT of the brain without IV contrast.
Hypodensity is seen in the periventricular white matter adjacent to the right lateral ventricle, which is more prominent than on the prior study, and also likely represents small vessel ischemic changes.

MRI was not possible due to presence of pacemaker, and the CT was not definitive for stroke.
His pressures stabilized off the medications and ran from SBP 110-130's.
His work-up for infection (U/A, urine cx, blood cx, CXR) was negative, and his WBC count always remained normal.
Neurology and Psychiatry were consulted, and their recommendations included r/o infection, d/c Zyprexa and Seroquel (use Haldol for agitation), and possibly repeat a head CT if his confusion continues.
An EKG was checked which showed no acute changes and 2 sets of CE's were negative.
