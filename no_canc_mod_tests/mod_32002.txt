There was 60% mid LAD and 80-90% D1 disease; no disease in Lcx.
A 9x20 balloon was deployed at the perforation and he was started on Neo and Dopamine for hypotension.
His pressures dropped and a balloon pump was placed with Neo and Dopamine running.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Comparted to the study from [**2116-4-22**], the basal and mid walls appear improved.

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2116-4-28**].
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Image quality was suboptimald - poor esophageal contact.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler but marked bowing of the intra-atrial septum leftward was noted, indicative of elevated right-sided pressure.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 50-55%) with inferior wall hypokinesis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-4-28**]:The Rv appeared smaller.
Severely dilated RA, The RV was smaller than seen on previous studies and remains severely depressed.
Over the course of the week, drips were titrated while RV and LV function were monitored closely.
Head/ abd CT scan negative on [**5-5**].
Emergent bedside bronchoscopy done on [**5-6**] for thickened bloody secretions.
