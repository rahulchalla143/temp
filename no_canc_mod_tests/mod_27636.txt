He was tried on APRV at P-high 38, P-low 10, T-high 1.5 and T-low 0.5 FIO2 100% and continued to be hypoxic.
A repeat gas was 7.19/62/46.
A CXR was obtained that showed LLL collapse and left sided infiltrate.
He was switched to pressure controlled ventilation at pressure 42, PEEP 22, rate 36 and FIO2 100% with mild improvement in his O2 sat's to around 80.
His nitric oxide was titrated down to 20ppm during the evening.
An EKG did not show evidence of peaked t waves.

After receiving over 5 units of PRBCs the HCT dropped further to 24.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, patient was oxygenating in the low 80's then went down to the 70's s/p recruitment manuveurs on FIO2 of 0.9.
A bronch was not performed given the high oxygen requirements (he had been bronched at the OSH where they saw secretions but no evidence of hemorrhage).
His oxygenation did not improve with APRV, but he did respond to nitric oxide.
All blood and sputum cultures were negative during his hospitalization.
On the last day of the hospitalization, his blood pressure dropped but responded to fluids.
A routine CXR that night showed a right pneumothorax.
Surgery was called STAT to the bedside and placed a chest tube.
His HCT dropped from 30 to 26.
He was given a total of 12 units of FFP and 5 units of PRBCs and his HCT lowered further to 24.
# ARF - on admission to the OSH patient had a creatinine of 1.7. unknown what his baseline was.
Ultrasound was negative.
# Thrombocytopenia/HIT - h/o HIT + antibodies in [**January 2191**], was on coumadin for unknown period of time.
# Cardiac -troponin elevated to 4 at OSH, had been trending down.
ECHO on [**11-3**] with EF 40% and a hypokinetic RV.
EKG here fairly unremarkable.
ECHO was done for concern over PFO that opened with high PEEP pressures.
tylenol levels negative at OSH.
His INR elevated to 4 at OSH but 1.6 on arrival here; LFT's also trending down.
His hepatitis serologies all were negative.
# Fever/Elevated WBC - patient with elevated WBC on arrival to the ED prior to the aspiration event.
CXR with aspiration PNA, UA negative, blood cultures negative to date from the OSH.
He was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics as above although all his cultures were NGTD during the hospitalization.
