Also noted to have elevated troponin 0.33 and BNP 10,190.
Patient then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the ED, VS: T 99.6 HR 107 BP 111/87 RR 20 93% on 4L.
Patient underwent CTA that showed interval improvement in previously noted PEs with no new thrombi.
Lung exam was notable for poor air movement and diffuse wheezes.

[**Month/Year (2) 7792**]: Pt ruled in with [**Month/Year (2) 7792**] with troponin peak of 0.66.
Was on heparin gtt, stoped [**8-29**] after INR was 2.0 x 3.
ABG 7.48/48/62/37, lactate 2.4.
# PUMP/ acute on chronic systolic CHF: [**7-16**] echo moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with sveere hypokinesis of the basal to mid septum and anterior wall, EF 30-35%.
BNP over 10,000 at admission.
Pt was orthostatic [**8-28**] with SBP to 80, improved BP with boluses .
#PE: PE discovered on previous admission in [**Month (only) 205**].
There was concern that the PE lead to the [**Month (only) 7792**] and SOB/COPD flare.
Repeat LENIs showed extension of R DVT, possibly to IVC.
INR now 2.0 on 4 straight measurements.
Continue to monitor INR .
ABG 7.48/48/62, lactate 2.4.
Repeated VBG after small bolus, was 7.39/56/41/35, lactate 2.1, improving with hydration.
Dx includes Neoplasm (as above, needs screening), undiagnosed asthma?, adrenal insufficiency (no e/o hypotension or hypoglycemia, but has evidence of adrenal disease on ct scan with normocytic anemia), connective tissue disease, sacrdoidosis, parasites (do not know travel history).
You will need further testing (a stress test) of your heart after you are finished being treated for your COPD exacerbation.
You also had an exacerbation of your COPD (breathing problem) and are being treated with steroids, an antibiotic (Levofloxacin), and breathing treatments.
The imaging of your lungs during this admission (CTA) showed that the clot in your lung is resolving.
However imaging of your leg showed that the clot is getting bigger.
You should discuss the need for further imaging of your chest in six months to follow up 'increasing mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy' of unclear etiology.
You should discuss the need for a stress test to evaluate your heart disease at that time.
