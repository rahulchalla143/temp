The ENT doctor requested a CT scan to rule out a basilar skull fracture due to the history of falling a week prior and the CT scan was obtained which failed to show any fracture; however, it did reveal an acute on chronic subdural hematoma and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in the posterior [**Last Name (un) 44708**] and tentorium.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, her vital signs were within normal limits.
The entire general physical examination including the head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, heart, lungs, and abdomen was essentially unremarkable with the exception of a right forearm cast which was covered with stockinette and which showed protruding hardware.
The remainder of the neurologic examination showed the patient to be awake, alert, oriented times three to time, place, and person.
The sensory examination was intact to light touch throughout except that she noted slight decreased light touch to the right fifth finger.
The deep tendon reflexes were essentially within normal limits with the right Achilles absent, left Achilles slightly diminished and the right plantar response mute and the left plantar response downgoing.
LABORATORIES/OTHER STUDIES:  The admission laboratory values were within normal limits, particularly the coagulations were 13.6 PT, 26.5 PTT, and INR of 1.3.
A CT scan reviewed from the [**Hospital3 8834**] showed an acute on chronic left-sided subdural hematoma with chronic phase along the entire hemisphere with a more acute phase measuring approximately 0.8 by 4 cm clot along the upper left frontal lobe.
There was also traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage along the tentorium and posterior [**Last Name (un) 44708**] but the basilar and prepontine cisterns were clear and showed no evidence of blood.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to clinical findings and findings on the outside CT scan, the patient was admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit for observation and q. one hour neurological checks throughout the night.
She spent the next two days in the Neuro Intensive Care Unit and showed a normal neurologic examination and a CT scan showed resolution of the subdural hematoma and the drain was subsequently removed on [**2105-11-25**].
She was given a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in approximately three to four weeks time, at which time a CT scan of the head would be obtained for further evaluation of resolution of the hematoma.
