**FINAL REPORT [**2187-4-9**]**     WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2187-4-9**]):       STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
**FINAL REPORT [**2187-4-9**]**     WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2187-4-9**]):       Mixed bacterial types (>= 3 colony morphologies) isolated.
Abbreviated work-up performed Isolate(s) identified and       susceptibility testing performed because of concomitant positive       blood culture(s) Comparison of the susceptibility patterns may be       helpful to assess clinical significance.
Blood Cx ([**4-8**]): No growth x2 .
Blood Cx ([**4-10**]): NGTD .
Blood Cx ([**4-12**]): NGTD .
IMAGING: ECG ([**4-5**]): Sinus rhythm at upper limits of normal rate, rate 94.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2187-3-31**] the limb lead voltage is less and lateral precordial voltage is increased, perhaps related to lead position.
The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the patient's right neck and right upper chest were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
The Amplatz guidewires were exchanged for two stiff glidewires, which were advanced into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance, one through each catheter lumen.
TTE ([**4-6**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the apical third of the left ventricle with focal dyskinesis of the apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypertensive urgency: The patient presented with a blood pressure of 229/56 and EKG showing old ST elevations in V1-V4, ST elevations more significantly in II, and decreased more significantly in aVR.
However, a repeat EKG was back to baseline.
His serum tox was negative.
He was initially placed on a Labetolol gtt, and transferred to the MICU for blood pressure management.
He was transitioned back to PO blood pressure medications, which were added back as his pressure tolerated.
We continued to hold his home doses of Clonidine 0.1 PO bid and Clonidine 0.2 mg/24 hr qSat, but these can be added back as his blood pressure tolerates.
He has been seen previously by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in GI (most recently in [**5-20**]), who indicated that he has had multiple past gastric emptying studies which have shown severe delay in emptying.
# Coag negative Staph bacteremia: The patient has had intermittent blood and catheter cultures positive for Coag negative Staph since [**2186-11-30**].
Blood culture from [**2187-4-3**] showed no growth, but his HD catheter and right triple lumen both grew Staph coag negative.
Surveillance blood cultures from [**4-8**], [**4-10**], and [**4-12**] showed no growth.
In order to work up the potential nidus of his bacteremia, he had a LUE ultrasound to evaluate his old HD graft, which showed complete thrombosis of the left upper extremity AV graft and no evidence of fluid collection/abscess in the surrounding soft tissues.
A TTE on this admission showed no vegetations.
He will need a toxicology screen and cardiology clearance prior to the operation.
ECG in ED was concerning for persistent ST elevations.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that the ECG was not concerning for a new cardiac event.
CEs 0.33->0.34, CK 239->166, CK-MB 8->5.
TTE showed severe symmetric LVH, LVEF 50% secondary to hypokinesis of the apical third of the left ventricle with focal dyskinesis of the apex, and no definite vegetations seen.
Urine tox was negative except for opiates (which he is receiving in house), ammonia 8.
