A stress echocardiogram on [**2134-1-13**] revealed ischemic changes in the absence of anginal type symptoms at a moderate cardiac demand and fair functional capacity.
He was found to have coronary artery disease with left main disease upon cardiac catheterization and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets.
A bubble study indicates the presence of a persistent left superior vena cava.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.

A stress echocardiogram on [**2134-1-13**] revealed ischemic changes in the absence of anginal type symptoms at a moderate cardiac demand and fair functional capacity.
He was found to have coronary artery disease with left main disease upon cardiac catheterization and was referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.
On POD 2 he was hypotensive with SBP 80's and complained of dizziness and lightheadedness.
He was transferred back to the CVICU for closer monitoring of blood pressure.
He had an echocardiaogram on [**2134-1-19**] which showed EF 50% and right ventricular cavity dilated with depressed free wall function.
A trial of 2.5mg lisinopril was started for EF 55% but his blood pressure did not tolerate even low dose lisinopril and it was discontinued.
