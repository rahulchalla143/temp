There was no evidence of ongoing nonconvulsive status epilepticus   Brief Hospital Course:   Ms. [**Known lastname 88343**] is [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with a past history of dementia (though her son says she is usually pretty sharp and only required placement in a nursing home about 1 month ago after she was getting recurrent UTIs and delirium) who lives at [**Location **] and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation form OSH for a seizure.
To work-up her seizure, she had basic metabolic labs checked, which were normal as well as a UA with no indication of UTI.
She also had a CT, MRI and EEG.
The EEG showed prominent focal slowing and some sharp components in the left temporal region, suggesting a marked focal subcortical dysfunction in that area.
An MRI of your brain was performed and showed diffuse white matter disease, likely due to small strokes (this is called Binswanger's disease).
An EEG was also performed to assess for seizure activity, this did not show any seizures but did show prominent focal slowing and some sharp components in the left temporal region indicating that there is a potential for seizures to begin in this region.
Please make sure that she checks your heart rate and rhythm; the medication controlling your heart rate can be increased if your pulse is too rapid.
