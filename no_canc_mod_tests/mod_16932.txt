Neurology:  The patient was initially on significant amount of sedation as he often had episodes of significant agitation which caused his ventilation to be impaired.
He was evaluated by the Neurology consult service, who obtained an electroencephalogram which showed diffuse encephalopathic pattern consistent with either medication effect or toxic metabolic pattern.
He underwent a head CT on [**2152-1-7**], which showed no intracranial hemorrhage or major vasculature territory infarction.
White matter microvascular disease and basal ganglia lacunes which are unchanged from prior study done on [**12-24**].
Post-tracheostomy placement on [**1-3**], the sedation was gradually weaned, and the patient was changed over to a fentanyl drip, and this was gradually weaned as well.
After discontinuation of sedation, mental status did continue to improve somewhat, to the point where he was consistently responding to commands, opening eyes to verbal stimuli, however, at the time of his discharge, it is still unclear how significant his neurological recovery has been, and how significant it will continue to be.
Repeat electroencephalogram done on [**2152-1-8**], showed moderately slow background with bursts of additional delta frequency slowing.
Cardiovascular:  From a coronary standpoint, the patient continued to require pressors, with Levophed being used from [**12-27**] until cardiac catheterization on [**2151-12-29**], at which point the patient underwent cardiac catheterization with intervention of the left anterior descending, D1 lesion as well as stenting of the left anterior descending.
Overall ejection fraction is still likely severely depressed.
Last echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 35 to 40% on [**2151-12-28**].
The decision was made to perform a tracheostomy, which was done on [**2152-1-4**], by Interventional Pulmonology.
Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2152-1-10**], by Interventional Pulmonology, which showed no evidence of active bleeding around the tracheostomy site, however, there was some mucosal irritation that was likely unmasked with heparin, and after the heparin was held for one day, it was restarted and there was no further evidence of bleeding from the tracheostomy site, and no bleeding from endotracheal suctioning.
White blood count was stable, and antibiotics were discontinued on [**2152-1-12**].
Blood cultures as well as sputum cultures were consistently showing no growth of organisms.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Throughout his hospital stay, electrolytes were repleted as needed.
Status post ventricular fibrillation/PEA arrest 3.
