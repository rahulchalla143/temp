She underwent CT guided drainage of the abscess, but continued to have increased abd pain and elevated white count, so went to the OR for sigmoid colectomy/hartmanns.
She began to have stool output from the ostomy on POD2, but on POD3 began putting out large amounts of bloody stool.
Hct was 15, so she was transferred to the ICU, where she received multiple units of PRBC and FFP.
Multiple endoscopies were done which revealed only nonbleeding gastric ulcers.
Tagged RBC scan was negative.

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was punctured and a 5 French sheath introduced over a guidewire using Seldinger technique.
Arteriogram was then performed in different projections.
The catheter was then repositioned into the left hepatic artery and another arteriogram was performed in several projections.
Followup arteriogram demonstrated occlusion of the splenic artery and no opacification of the pseudoaneurysm or distal splenic artery.
The catheter was then repositioned into the superior mesenteric artery and arteriogram was performed.
TECHNIQUE: CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without intravenous contrast followed by CT of the abdomen and pelvis post-administration of intravenous contrast, reconstructions were performed in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes.
COMPARISON: With angiogram of [**2133-1-30**].
FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a left basal effusion with atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
There are multiple coils present in the splenic artery, and on the post- contrast examination, there are multiple low-attenuation foci within the spleen one of them in anterior portion of the spleen with a convex outer margin, suggestive a combination of cysts and splenic infarcts.
CT PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a drain present within the pelvis, traversing the right lower pelvic wall.
On [**1-30**] she underwent mesenteric angiography which revealed no active bleeding, but did reveal a splenic artery aneurysm.
However her hematocrit continued to drop and she was given 2 more units of PRBC on [**1-30**].
Her hematocrit dropped again on [**2-2**] so an additional 2 units of PRBC were given and EGD was performed.
Endoscopy was repeated on [**2-4**] and the same ulcer was injected and fulgurated once again.
Subsequently her hematocrit remained stable so she was transferred to the floor.
On the floor, Mrs.[**Doctor Last Name 21128**] hematocrit continued to be stable.
As she was tolerating regular diet, ambulating, and her hematocrit was stable, she was discharged to rehab on ***********  Medications on Admission: Oxycodone, Timolol, Xalatan, Ambien, Celexa.
