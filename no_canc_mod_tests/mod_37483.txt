GRAM STAIN (Final [**2117-5-23**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    RESULTS PENDING.
[**5-11**] CT HEAD IMPRESSION: 1.
[**5-11**] CXR UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Study is limited due to patient rotation.
Low lung volumes are noted, without definite focal consolidation.
[**5-12**] CT ABD/PELVIS IMPRESSION: 1.
[**5-14**] INITIAL EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] generalized periodic epileptic discharges representing electrographic seizures seen at the beginning of recording lasting about one hour.
After administration of Ativan, the electrographic seizure resolved and the epileptic discharges  occurred more sporadically.
[**5-13**] REPEAT CT HEAD [**Month/Year (2) **]: This study is limited due to patient motion.
[**5-15**] MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]: The study is compared with recent NECT of [**2117-5-13**], and most recent non-enhanced MR examination of [**2115-3-19**].
There is acute-on-chronic inflammatory disease in the maxillary sinuses and anterior ethmoidal and frontal air cells, as on the previous MR study; extensive fluid-opacification of the right mastoid air cells is significantly worse.
CXR [**2117-5-21**]: [**Month/Day/Year **]: The patient is status post tracheostomy.
There is moderate left lower lobe volume loss, unchanged compared to the study from the prior day.
ABDOMINAL PLAIN FILM KUB [**2117-5-20**] [**Month/Day/Year **]: Single supine abdominal radiograph demonstrates G-tube balloon in the region of the gastric antrum.
CXR POST-TRACH PLACEMENT [**2117-5-21**] [**Month/Day/Year **]: The patient is status post tracheostomy.
There is moderate left lower lobe volume loss, unchanged compared to the study from the prior day.
CT HEAD [**2117-5-23**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT ABDOMEN [**2117-5-23**] - 1.
Stable left lung base consolidation and small left pleural effusion.
Afterward the cardiac arrest and ROSC, she rapidly requiring max doses of 3 pressors to keep her systolic blood pressure in the 90s-100s.
Post-arrest, even on max-dose pressors, her blood pressure steadily dropped throughout the day.
CT head repeated - unchanged from prior.
ICU team and neuro teams both felt intubation would likely be irreversible in this pt w/poor underlying mental status and multiple severe comorbidities.
After intubation, her EEG improved, no longer showing epileptiform activity and her AEDs were able to be weaned with discontinuation of fosphenytoin and benzodiazepines and then valproic acid.
Sputum cultures returned with carbapenmase producing klebsiella pneumoniae - sensitive to gentamicin.
Repeat CT abd/pelvis on [**5-23**] in setting of worsening leukocytosis despite therapeutic-dosing gentamycin showed stable (not improved) L lung base consolidation).
Pt pan-cultured and CT head, CT abdomen/pelvis were repeated.
These showed only stable L lung base consolidation - known Klebsiella pneumonia already being treated w/gentamycin.
WBC was down-trending on discharge and she was continued on vancomycin PO.
#GAP ACIDOSIS Pt acutely developed a gap acidosis (AG 26) on [**5-23**].
She also required intermittent 1x doses nifedipine to keep SBP <150.
