The patient got 800cc NS and SBP increased to 80 and HR decreased to 80s with positive carotid pulses.
On arrival in the ER, she was noted to be in sinus tach- and hypotensive (BP not recorded) and received an additional 2L NS with SBP inc to 100-110- then decreased to 90 systolic.
A right groin line was placed, blood cultures were drawn, CXR Head CT and Chest CT were obtained.

AEROBIC BOTTLE (Pending): ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Pending):  [**2145-10-6**] HEAD CT FINDINGS: Examination is suboptimal due to patient motion.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
[**2145-10-6**] CT OF THE CHEST:  FINDINGS: The examination is technically suboptimal due to difficulties with bolus timing.
Her cardiace enzymes were cycled and the results are as follows  [**10-6**] CK 151  CK-MB 12  Troponin  1.33       CK 250  CK-MB 16  Troponin  1.45       CK 198  CK-MB 11  Troponin  1.05       CK 200            Troponin  0.97  Cardiology was consulted and followed the patient during her hospital stay.
EKG not suggestive of MI as no Q waves or ST changes.
Serial EKG exams were done and remained unchanged.
An ECHO was performed that showed significant valvular disease, LV hypokinesis with an EF of 30%.
The initial cause of her hypotension was likely [**12-21**] to her PEA arrest that was complicated by her severe underlying cardiac disease.
CXR revealed a PNA, likely thought to be aspiration.
Sputum ctx grew 4+ GPC.
She received dialysis prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] on Sunday [**10-10**].
Head CT on initial presentation was negative.
