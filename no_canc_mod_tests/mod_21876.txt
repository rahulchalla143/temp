His cultures from L heel ulcer also grew dense proteus so this was felt to be the source.
Vascular was consulted and arteriogram was performed on [**8-17**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and angioplasty was successfully performed on distal graft.
Pt's Hct drifted down to 25 so he required several blood transfusions to aim for Hct >30.
Given his thrombocytopenia (plts as low as 30) he was transfused several bags of plts to keep count >100.
He had a MRI of his head which revealed diffuse microvascular dz but no acute CVA.
Pain - The patient has some pain from the ulcer, as well as from the rectus sheath hematoma.
Return to the hospital if his hct is unable to be stablized with ocasional transfusion.
