The monitoring and support devices are constant.
The diameter of the vascular structures might indicate mild fluid overload, as observed on [**2115-4-1**], 4:15 a.m. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities  CXR [**4-1**]:Compared to the previous radiograph, the film focuses on the upper abdomen.
EEG [**4-11**]: Abnormal EEG due to the very low voltage background activity, no definite activity of cortical origin.
CT head [**4-12**]: FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or infarction.
CXR [**4-13**]: ET tube is in standard placement.

Saturations were in the mid 80's on room air with improvement to the 90's on NRB.
A-line was placed for BP monitoring.
In summary, the pt is an 80y/o gentleman with CAD s/p CABG x2, sCHF EF 25%, VT/AT/AVNRT s/p ICD and ablation, CKD, DM2 and chronic venous stasis who initially presented with LLE cellulitis, course complicated by worsening CHF unresponsive to diuresis, [**Last Name (un) **] progressing to uremia requiring HD, AMS with myoclonus requiring intubation for airway protection, and superimposed pustular MSSA cellulitis, who was subsequently extubated with gradually improving mental status and transferred to the CCU due to hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT.  #.
Blood cultures were negative.Initially AMS was accompanied by myoclonus which resolved during CCU course: per neuro this was probably [**12-27**] uremia.
Also had LP given vesicular rash with concern for viral encephalitis: HSV/VZV PCR negative and no e/o infection in CSF.
Also had EEG which was negative per neuro.
LLE cellulitis: Initially dx with non-purulent cellulitis, which he is at increased risk for given chronic BLE venous stasis.
PPD placed and was negative.
Added on hepatitis serologies which were neg for HAV and HCV but c/w past infection to HBV.
sCHF [**12-27**] ischemia: EF 25%.
Hypervolemic on exam on CCU admission.
Checked stool c.diff and it was positive.
EKG was unchanged from prior, V-paced.
CXR was unchanged from prior.
The patient recovered a pulse and was transferred to the CCU and was intubated.
Head CT was obtained and did not show any ICH or edema.
His renal function continued to be poor, but dialysis was difficult to initiate in the setting of tenuous blood pressures (80s to 90s) and the worry that SBPs would drop with large fluid shifts.
