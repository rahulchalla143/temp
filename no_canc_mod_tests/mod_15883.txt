Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 9995**] was originally admitted to [**Hospital6 2561**] for evaluation after haven fallen at home.
During his evaluation, he was noticed to be jaundiced with a bilirubin of 11.0 with an amylase of 4,000 and lipase of 1,000.
The patient was watched clinically over the weekend but then was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for semi-urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography when he began to have symptoms of fever and respiratory distress.
Upon arrival to the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography suite, the patient was felt to be in mild respiratory distress.
Conscious sedation was attempted but the patient was uncooperative with the examination and was subsequently intubated for general anesthesia.
The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was significant for the finding of approximately one liter of dark coffee ground as well as hemorrhagic gastritis in the superficial pyloric ulcer.
The patient's duodenum, however, was so edematous that the ampulla could not be engaged and the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was unable to be completed.
An ultrasound at that time did reveal a 1.1 cm stone in the distal common bile duct.
Notice was made of the patient's dropping platelet count from 300 at the outside hospital to 63 upon transfer.
The patient is subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring and care after the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and requisite intubation.
The patient most recently had an echocardiogram ten days prior to transfer which showed moderate to severe aortic insufficiency and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation with a normal ejection fraction of 55%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 99.1; blood pressure 92/56; heart rate 105; respiratory rate 12; oxygen saturation 99%.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
There were 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally.
On admission to [**Hospital1 69**] hospital, the patient's laboratory studies revealed a white count of 17.4; hemoglobin of 10.4; hematocrit of 30.9; platelet count on admission was 30 with an INR of 1.6, PTT of 33.3 and PT of 15.9.
Fibrinogen was 435.
FDP was 160 to 320.
Original chemistry 7 showed a sodium of 136; potassium of 3.9; chloride of 109; bicarbonate of 23; BUN of 56; creatinine of 1.2.
Glucose of 99.
Amylase was 877.
Total bilirubin was 11.9.
Alkaline phosphatase was 231.
ALT was 124; AST 220.
Lipase of 975.
Last electrocardiogram and CK MB's were negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit directly after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and intubation.
Hematocrit was followed throughout the remainder of his hospitalization, given his potential recent gastrointestinal bleed.
Hematocrit did subsequently remain stable and did not require any transfusions.
His initial laboratory studies were consistent with an element of DIC.
To that extent, a heparin induced antibody was sent and the patient was not started on any heparin or H2 blockers.
The patient's electrocardiogram showed no evidence of any acute changes, as compared to his other hospital.
His troponin leak continued to trend downwards and was more suggestive of a distant event.
His initial blood cultures which were drawn on admission subsequently grew Enterococcus which was then revealed as Vancomycin resistant.
The heart was investigated with echo which revealed an ejection fraction of 45%, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
