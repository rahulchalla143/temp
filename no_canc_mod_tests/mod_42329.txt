On admission, he has a significant anion gap approximately 70, a bicarb of 5, serum glucose of 1,114, and urinalysis positive for greater than 80 ketones, greater than 1,000 glucose.
Transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2146-8-4**] with global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction estimated at 20-30%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile, heart rate 100, blood pressure 120/55, respiratory rate 20, and oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 17.6, hematocrit 44, platelets of 282.
Sodium of 120, corrected sodium of approximately 134, potassium 5.1, chloride 67, bicarb of 5, BUN 63, creatinine at 2.4, glucose 1,114.
Urine tox screen negative.
Endocrine:  Patient presented in diabetic ketoacidosis with an anion gap of 70 due to patient not taking insulin in the setting of nausea, vomiting, and decreased po intake.
His potassium and phosphate were aggressively repleted, and he received insulin teaching from the Learning Center demonstrating good insulin administration technique, and good use of glucometer.
Cardiac:  The patient ruled in for a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 310 on [**3-8**], peak troponin of 21.8 on [**3-9**].
A non-Q-wave myocardial infarction was likely secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis and not a precipitating factor for diabetic ketoacidosis since cardiac enzymes peaked on hospital days two and three.
An echocardiogram obtained on [**3-10**] showed an ejection fraction of 20-25%, significant spontaneous echocardiogram in left ventricle without thrombus.
Impression:  Unchanged from prior echocardiogram from [**2146-8-4**].
The patient was placed on a Heparin drip for approximately 48 hours, and underwent cardiac catheterization on [**3-13**], which showed no coronary artery disease and normal filling pressures.
The patient's lipid profile was triglycerides 92, HDL 52, LDL 77, thus Lipitor was discontinued.
Gastrointestinal:  Patient had elevated amylase and lipase with a lipase of 160 and an amylase of 166.
A full skin examination by Dermatology may be appropriate on an outpatient basis in the future.
