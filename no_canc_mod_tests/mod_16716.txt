Presented to [**Hospital3 36606**] Hospital where noncontrast CT showed possible leaky abdominal aneurysm.
Of note, pt recently started HD, and earlier in summer pt had been noted to have right renal mass on CT and tried multiple times to undergo an MRI but was unable to tolerate it.
He was transferred to ED here for further workup, and contrast CT showed large perirenal/RP bleed on R as well as kidneys with multiple cysts, stable 4cm nonruptured nondissected AAA.
During this time,  his hct dropped from 38 to 35.
Work-up also significant for wbc of 14 with left shift, new onset afib, hyperglycemia, and slightly elevated troponin.

No definite cause is found, but suspicion is that the	 findings may relate to rupture of a renal lesion, perhaps that	 mentioned on a previous renal ultrasound examination of [**2100-3-28**].
MRI kidney [**2100-8-13**] IMPRESSION: Right perinephric hematoma, with an approximately 3.5 cm mass	 within the anterior aspect of the right kidney, probably representing a renal	 cell carcinoma.
Pt sent for repeat CT scan which demonstrated a stable retroperitoneal and perirenal bleed.
HD 2 and 3, pt required 3 units total of prbcs for continued drop in Hct although pt with subjective improvement of symptoms; pt recieved hemodialysis on HD 3 but RIJ tunnel cath is poorly functioning.
Over the next week he had received a total of 10 units of blood to stabilize his hematocrit at around 31.
Hemolysis labs were checked and negative.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: retroperitoneal bleed, likely from right renal mass right renal mass, cannot rule out renal cell carcinoma renal failure, on dialysis   Discharge Condition: Pt had no pain and hematocrit was stable above 30 for two days.
