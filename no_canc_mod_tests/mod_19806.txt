CT Spine [**9-30**] IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or malalignment  Brief Hospital Course: Assesment: This is a 38 yo M with hx of alcohol abuse presenting with respiratory depression secondary to alcohol intoxication with EtOH level of 522, now with normalization of respiratory status without need for intubation/mechanical ventilation.
He did not require intubation, but had end-tidal CO2 monitoring which was normal.
CT Head and C-spine were performed and showed no acute injury, bleed or fracture.
Pt was been stable overnight and was monitored on a CIWA scale, but only recieved 0.5mg ativan for sleep.
End-tidal CO2 monitoring was normal (39) in the emergency department.
The patient's tox screen was negative, so presumably related EtOH overdose which is most likely given level >500.
