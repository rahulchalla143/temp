He describes this as substernal chest pressure with no radiation with associated severe shortness of breath, "gasping" for air with minimal exertion on walk to mailbox.
An EKG completed upon arrival to [**Hospital **] Hospital demonstrated ST depressions anterolaterally - leads I, V4-V6, and a troponin was found to be 20.57, down to 18, then elevated to 22.8.
CXR showed mild vascular congestion and he was treated with Lasix 20 mg IV overnight on [**12-13**] due to some shortness of breath and chest pain.
Additionally, he received a loading dose of Plavix 600mg, placed on a heparin drip, continued on atenolol, and nitropaste applied for chest pain.
CXR completed at OSH was consistent with CHF.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
Physical Exam: VS - T 98.4 BP 107/87 HR 73 RR 24 O2 94% RA Gen: WD/WN male in NAD.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 10 cm - lying flat.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
RR with ectopic beats, normal S1, S2.
R groin no hematoma or thrill, pulses 2+ dp and pt bilaterally.
The distal RCA, as well as the LAD territory, were supplied by the collaterals from the acute marginal (that itself had mild  disease).
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated filling pressures with an RVDP of 22 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 30 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was depressed at 1.84 l/min/m2.
The systemic arterial systolic pressure was normal at 117 mmHg.
Left ventriculography with a manual contrast injection revealed an LVEF of 20% with a global LV hypokinesis.
[**2188-2-19**] Abdominal US: 1.
[**2188-2-20**] Transthoracic ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.

He underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease(see result section for further detail).
Cardiac surgery was consulted and additional preoperative evaluation was performed.
Carotid ultrasound was unremarkable while abdominal ultrasound was notable for ectasia of the distal abdominal aorta measuring up to 3 cm.
Preoperative echocardiogram showed moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %) with inferior akinesis, trace aortic insufficiency and only mild mitral regurgitation.
He was intermittently transfused to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
Cardioversions were performed on [**2-29**] and 13th without much success.
His INR was followed very closely and dosed for a goal INR around 2.0 - 3.0.
On DC INR is 3.4 / Start Coumadin [**3-10**].
Coumadin should be dosed for goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0.
