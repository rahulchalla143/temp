The chest x-ray showed questionable right lower lobe infiltrate versus congestive heart failure, so he was given Levaquin.
He was brought to [**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization which showed two-vessel disease, but intervention could not be accomplished given the location of the lesions.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for fevers but positive for chills, positive for a nonproductive cough, negative for melena or hematochezia, negative for urinary symptoms.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were pulse 106 and regular, blood pressure 167/64, respiratory rate 16, pulmonary artery pressure 75/47, oxygen saturation 100% on five liters.
Cardiovascular:  Examination was significant for distant heart sounds, S1 and S2 normal, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Abdomen:  Examination significant for positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.
His hematocrit was 41.6.
Platelet count was 202.
MCV was 97.
PTT 28.9.
Chemistries revealed a glucose of 173, sodium 138, potassium 4.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate 26, BUN 29, creatinine 6.
His calcium was 9.1.
Cardiac enzymes revealed a CK of 759 with a troponin of 8.
His LDH was 1,164.
His AST was 169, ALT 23, alkaline phosphatase 107, bilirubin 0.6, albumin 3.2, total protein 6.5.
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia, normal axis and intervals, no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, low voltage, Qs in 2, 3 and F that were old, and pseudonormalization in 1, 2, 3 and F as well as questionable ST and T wave changes in V1 through V5.
Cardiac catheterization revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease with a left anterior descending coronary artery distal occlusion, a left circumflex 40-50% long obtuse marginal #1, right coronary artery stent from a previous catheterization patent with a small distal PL lesion of 70% at the origin.
Cardiac catheterization revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension and a wedge pressure of 32, with PA pressures of 50/27 and a mean of 34.
Because his coronary artery disease was not repaired during cardiac catheterization, the decision was made to keep the patient on heparin drip during his hospital stay.
Multiple chest x-rays were taken throughout his hospital stay to assess the status of his congestive heart failure.
An echocardiogram was obtained, which revealed mild left atrial dilatation, an ejection fraction of 30-35%, akinesis of the distal half of the left ventricle and posterior wall, severe thickening and deformity of the aortic valve leaflet, mild aortic valve stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral valve leaflet thickening, mild mitral regurgitation.
Based on the echocardiogram results, the patient was deemed appropriate for long-term anticoagulation, but this was not started immediately, given his hemodialysis issues which are further described below.
A TSH was obtained and it was normal.
Blood cultures were drawn and the patient was also pancultured.
There was no evidence of a pneumonia by either sputum culture or chest x-ray.
The patient has been receiving vancomycin one gram at dialysis based on vancomycin levels drawn in the morning.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of a pneumonia.
Anemia:  The patient was admitted with an hematocrit of 41.6, but with hydration this number dropped to between 31 and 34.
As a consequence the patient's hematocrit dropped to below 28 and he required transfusion of packed red blood cells.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient had several episodes of hyperkalemia without symptoms or EKG changes.
