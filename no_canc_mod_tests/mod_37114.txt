CXR [**2171-5-5**]: There are lucencies of the apices consistent with emphysematous change.
Since the previous tracing of same date sinus tachycardia rate is slower, delayed precordial QRS transition pattern is less prominent and inferior lead ST-T wave changes are decreased.
CXR [**2171-5-9**]: IMPRESSION: Bilateral opacifications concerning for pneumonia, unchanged since [**2171-5-7**].
Micro:    RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2171-5-8**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
# COPD exacerbation/pneumonia:  Patient's symptoms and exam point to likely COPD exacerbation as evidenced by wheezing on exam and low O2 sats with improvement of symptoms with nebulizers.
Chest X-ray showed no sign of infiltrate.
He was not seen to aspirate, though his CXR showed new bilateral lower lobe haziness.
Serial CXR showed a worsening left lower lobe infiltrate which was likely the cause for the worsening.
# [**Last Name (un) **]:  Creatinine at 1.3, which was stable from last year.
On the day he was sent to the MICU his creatinine increased from 1.3 to 1.8.
After foley put in, his creatinine decreased, so obstructive pathology was possible.
By discharge, the patient's creatinine had returned to baseline or below.
His BUN is increased out of proportion to his creatinine, which suggests he may have a mild GI bleed.
His hematocrit does not suggest a brisk bleed.
