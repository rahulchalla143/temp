Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2129-3-16**] at 11:50:08 AM      FINAL  The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-3-15**], the region of hypokinesis in the distal inferoseptum has decreased.
On POD 1 he was weaned off the nitro.
His hct was still low and he was transfused another unit of prbcs.
His ekg st elevation in S II,III and his cardiac enzymes were positive, and trending upwards.
His hct remained slightly decreased and on [**3-21**] it was recommended to transfuse 1 unit of prbcs.
On [**3-22**] his hct had trended down to approximately 24 and we strongly encouraged him to be transfused.
He remained hemodynamically stable and his hct was stable on [**3-22**].
