After the Nitroglycerin drip was started, her blood pressure dropped to 70 systolic and remained there for approximately 15 minutes.
Her pressure responded to a two liter intravenous fluid bolus and the Nitroglycerin drip was discontinued.
She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
Her wedge pressures were found to be elevated at approximately 22 and she subsequently received 20 mg of intravenous Lasix to which she diuresed over 2.5 liters with a reduction in her wedge to 16.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Physical examination showed a temperature of 98.9 F.; heart rate of 75; blood pressure 107/58; 02 saturations were 100% at room air.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her neurological examination showed her alert and oriented times three with no focal abnormalities.
LABORATORY:  Upon admission, showed a white blood cell count of 16.8, a hematocrit of 38.0 and a platelet count of 269.
Her Chem-7 showed a sodium of 140, potassium of 3.6, a chloride of 109, bicarbonate of 24, BUN of 12, creatinine 0.5, glucose of 118.
Her PT was 12.8, PTT 40.1, INR was 1.1.
Her liver function tests were normal.
Her magnesium was 1.6, calcium 7.7, phosphate 3.0.
EKG post intervention showed a normal sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute with a normal axis and normal intervals.
Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
The left circumflex lesion was successfully stented and the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further observation.
She was placed on Telemetry and her cardiac enzymes were cycled.
Her peak CK was 3,745 with a CK MB of 654 for an MB index of 17.5.
Her lipid panel was checked which showed a total cholesterol of 192 with an LDL of 123.
An echocardiogram showed there was a mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be estimated.
Her electrolytes were repleted as needed.
