We took a CT scan of your neck, which did not show any obstructions.
2) You will need a CT scan in one year of your chest because there were findings of "pulmonary nodules" and the radiologist had recommended one year as a time frame to recheck a CT scan.
3) You will need outpatient PFTs at some time after your visit with your primary care doctor.
4) He will need to check your BP at the time of your appointment.
