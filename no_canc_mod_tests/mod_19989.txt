Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ICD placement Cardiac catheterization .
At the OSH there was concern for PE but due to an iodine dye allergy a CTA chest could not be performed, but a CT chest w/o contrast was done which was unremarkable.
He also had a CT head which was negative.
He was sent by helicopter to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment.
His initial BP was 150s systolic, HR 110s, and 90% O2 sat.
His labs are below and notable for WBC of 17, lactate as high as 6.8 and blood ph of 7.09 on admission.
He had a repeat CT head which was unremarkable.
A chest x-ray showed pulm edema, no effusion, and a retrocardiac opacity.
He had a bedside echo which showed a pericardial effusion, and cardiology was called who repeated the echo at the bedside, and felt the effusion to be small and not likely new.
During his ED course, his BP dropped to 80s systolic, and he was given 2L NS and started on dopamine gtt.
His urine tox screen was positive for opiates and amphetamines.
Physical Exam: VS: T 96.2 BP 130/81 HR 90 RR 29 100% on AC/500/32/10, FiO2 0.5  Gen: sedated, follows commands appropriately HEENT: perrl, OP clear Neck: supple neck, difficult to assess JVD stiffness of neck (ankylosing spondylitis) Lungs: course b/l BS.

[**2132-12-7**] CXR (portable) - Increased interstitial marking of pulmonary edema.
[**2132-12-7**] CT head - 1.
[**2132-12-10**] ECHO - There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis of the inferior wall., distal LV and apex.
[**2132-12-11**] CTA - 1.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis with new ground-glass opacities near the lung apices, which may relate to fluid overload, or multifocal areas of pneumonitis.
[**2132-12-16**] CXR (PA and lateral) - ICD leads in appropriate position without pneumothorax.
Central aortic pressure was normal at 116/67.
He was covered broadly with Vanco/levo/flagyl initially but weaned off vancomycin as his cultures remained negative.
Blood cultures, sputum culture, and BAL for PCP were all negative.
He had no EKG changes and cardiac enzymes were negative, so pulmonary edema due to decompensated heart failure was felt to be the most likely cause.
He had several sets of cardiac enzymes which remained flat.
He underwent an echocardiogram which revealed a depressed LVEF (25-30%).
His b-blocker was downtitrated and his ACEi was uptitrated.
CEs were negative x multiple sets.
Suspicion for cardiac ischemia was high enough that he underwent cardiac catheterization.
Cath revealed 2 vessel CAD.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for assistance with his diabetes management as his finger sticks were elevated to the 300s.
When his blood pressure allowed, he was restarted on his home Carvedilol and ACEI.
His carvedilol dose was decreased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] as his blood pressure did not tolerated 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Anemia: His hematocrit averaged in the low to mid 30s.
Hemolysis labs were negative and his Hct remained stable.
Medications on Admission: sulfasalazine 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] glyburide/metformin 2.5/500mg 2 tab qAM, 1 tab qPM aspirin 81 mg daily ranitidine 150 mg daily folic acid 1 mg daily lipitor 20 mg daily isosorbide 30 mg daily enalapril 10 mg daily coreg 2.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] salsalate 750 mg [**Hospital1 **] loratadine 10 mg daily remicaide 500 mg every 6 weeks (last dose [**2132-11-27**]) vicodin 5/500mg 1 tab QID:PRN .
You blood sugars were very elevated during your hospitalization and you have been switched to insulin for your diabetes management.
