Post- surgical changes within the right mastoid air cells are again demonstrated with an air fluid level, unchanged in the interval.
IMPRESSION: Overall, stable appearance of subacute/chronic right subdural hematoma.

Then, in AM of [**2170-10-7**], he decompensated with temp to 101.6, rigors, and hypotension with SBP of 80's.
Additionally, his oxygen dropped to 78% on RA -> 97% on 100% NRB -> 97% on 3L NC.
ABG done at codewhile on 100% NRB was 7.43/31/132, lactate of 2.0.
His hypotension was felt to be due to vasodilation from sepsis in combination with hypovolemia.
His culture data only revealed gram negative rods in his urine, and Vanc, Levo and Flagyl were continued.
During his ICU stay he was less responsive to stimuli and a repeat CT scan revealed unchanged size and mass effect from subdural hematoma.
He developed LUE edema and on [**10-13**] a LUE doppler was performed which showed occlusive thrombosis of both brachial veins and the axillary vein, and nearly completely occlusive thrombosis of the subclavian vein.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stim test was performed, with decreased Cortisol response, and pt.
His WBC continued to be elevated.
Repeat CT last: unchanged subdural hematoma/hypodense collection, unchanged/persistent mass effect on right cerebelar cortex, minimal right to left midline shift.
