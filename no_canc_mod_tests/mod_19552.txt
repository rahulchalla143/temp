She was also noted to have elevated creatinine to 2.6 from a recent baseline of 1.5, but a prior baseline of 0.9-1.1.
She was also bolused several liters for low UOP with no improvement in her blood pressure.
The patient underwent EKG that showed S1Q3T3 pattern with right heart strain.
She underwent echo that showed a dilated globally hypokinetic right ventricle, new moderate pulmonary hypertension, and moderate TR.
With persistent hypotension the patient then underwent V/Q scan that showed pulmonary embolism.

IMAGING: CXR ([**6-21**]) - Small left pleural effusion and new left infrahilar consolidation are most readily explained by atelectasis, but there is no way to exclude pneumonia.
CXR ([**6-22**]) - Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance including cardiomegaly.
ECHO [**6-22**] There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
ECHO [**6-23**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-6-22**], the appearance of mitral regurgitation is increased, but may be so due to technical factors.
The left ventricular ejection fraction is reduced, most likely as a result of ventricular interaction with a pressure and volume overloaded right ventricle.
V/Q SCAN [**2201-6-23**]: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate subsegmental defects in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show several subsegmental defects in the right lower lobe  and left lower lobe which match, along with several subsegmental defects in the right and left upper lobes which do not match.
Chest x-ray shows small left pleural effusion and left infrahilar consolidation .
CXR [**2201-6-26**]: There are lower lung volumes.
Lumbar spine hardware is partially imaged.
Neurologic exam remained intact throughout admission.
#Pulmonary embolism -  Patient with large pulmonary embolism, provoked by spinal surgery.
At onset, pulmonary embolism caused hypotension with right heart strain as seen on EKG and ECHO.
The patient should maintain INR between [**2-6**] at all times.
The patient should undergo transthoracic echo in 6 weeks to follow up cardiac function with resolution of pulmonary embolism.
Please check INR on [**6-29**] and adjust coumadin dosing as needed.
LVEF 55% on most recent TTE, however now with right heart strain.
Baseline weight 140lbs.
Weight at discharge was 164.6lbs.
She should undergo an electrolyte check on [**2201-6-29**] for stability following diuresis.
#[**Last Name (un) **] - During admission, creatinine peaked at 2.7 in the setting of right heart failure.
Creatinine returned to baseline with diuresis from lasix, and possibly post-ATN autodiuresis.
Dry weight 140 lbs.
# Patient should undergo INR and electrolyte monitoring every other day starting [**2201-6-29**] while on coumadin and lasix.
Goal INR [**2-6**].
# Multiple blood cultures pending at discharge  Medications on Admission: Home Medications: Gabapentin 300mg QHS Flexeril 5mg prn (takes ~weekly) Metoprolol 25mg daily Diovan HCTZ Oral 160 mg-12.5 mg daily Allopurinol 100 daily folic acid 800mcg daily zyrtec 10mg daily Calcium, Vit D, fish oil, glucosamine, flaxseed daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
Diovan HCT *NF* (valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide) 160-12.5 mg Oral daily 6.
OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5 mg PO Q4H:PRN pain 14.
Oxycodone SR (OxyconTIN) 20 mg PO Q12H pain 16.
Outpatient Lab Work Check INR on Monday [**2201-6-29**].
(Pt is on coumadin); Goal INR = 2.0-3.0; do not exceed 3.0 as pt had recent spinal surgery.
Check electrolytes on Monday [**2201-6-29**].
During your hospitalization, you were found to have a blood clot in your lungs that decreased your blood pressure.
You were started on coumadin to help thin your blood and prevent progression of the blood clot.
Your weight at discharge is 164.6 lbs (up from 140lb).
You should have blood work checked regularly to monitor your INR (how thin your blood is) and your electrolytes.
