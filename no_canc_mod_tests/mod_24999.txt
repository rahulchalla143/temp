Follow up MRI or PET CT may be of utility for further evaluation.
Mild ascites and mesenteric edema, which may be reactive to relatively recent surgery.
CT Abd [**2117-1-18**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Compared to the prior study, the amount of fecal loading within the colon has improved.
CXR [**2117-1-18**] The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach and should be advanced.
Current study demonstrates interstitial pulmonary edema, moderate in severity.
Evaluation of the patient after diuresis is highly recommended.
CXR [**2028-1-23**] FINDINGS: Unchanged small loculated effusion on the left with decreasing extent of the retrocardiac atelectasis.
CXR [**2117-1-25**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the left pleural effusion has mildly increased.
CXR [**2028-1-26**] IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in right basal opacity after diuresis though the residual remains concerning for pneumonia.
Thin barium, thick barium, and barium-coated cookie were administered.
CXR [**2117-1-30**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-22**] through [**1-27**]: Lungs are severely hyperinflated.
If there is concern for hematoma or pelvic infection, CT scanning would be required.
EMG Study Date of [**2117-2-3**] Clinical Interpretation: Abnormal study.
Vital signs were routinely monitored.
The patient was transitioned to home dose of Metoprolol and the patient's blood pressure was adequately controlled.
A CXR was concerning for possible aspiration vs hospital acquired pneumonia and she was started on a 10 day course of levofloxacin.
The pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on POD 1 for respiratory precautions in case of deterioration and need for intubation.
Thereafter, her saturations and vitals remained stable despite occasional subjective dyspnea while supine.
All vital signs were routinely monitored.
She had bowel sounds throughout this whole time and abdominal distention was improving.
Due to the possible aspiration pneumonia and vocal cord issues, a speech and swallow study was ordered before advancing her diet.
The next day, a video swallow study was ordered which she passed and was allowed to start a diet with many aspiration precautions in place.
Her distention and obstipation continued to worsen and a KUB was obtained which showed colonic ileus.
It was again replaced on HD 9/POD1 for close urine output monitoring given respiratory status and desire to keep from fluid overload.
She was kept on face mask in the ICU and her O2 sat was stable.
#Healthcare acquired pneumonia: After patient's stridor improved, she was noted to have continued O2 requirement and repeat CXR showed a new RLL consolidation and she was started on treatment for HCAP with vancomycin and cefepime on [**2117-1-25**].
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush PICC, non-heparin dependent: Flush with 10 mL Normal Saline daily and PRN per lumen.
Prior to this procedure you were noted to have a possible aspiration pneumonia on chest Xray for which you were treated with a full course of Levofloxacin intravenously.
You were evaluated multiple times at the bedside by the speech and swallow team and you will be reevaluated at the rehab to progress your diet further after the repeat study of your vocal cords.
