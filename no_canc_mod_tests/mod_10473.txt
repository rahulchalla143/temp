PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 97 rectal, heart rate 72, pressure of 170/133, respiratory rate 18, pulse oximetry 100%  The patient was intubated and sedated.
Chest and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His peripheral pulses were intact.
LABORATORY:  On admission included a hematocrit of 37.7, white count 8.7, BUN and creatinine 18.8, and amylase of 68, lipase 2.1.
Blood gas was 7.51, 29, 434, 24 and 1.
Serum tox was negative.
Urinalysis showed 11 to 20 red blood cells.
His urine tox is negative.
Initial trauma workup and imaging included a chest x-ray demonstrated adequate position of the endotracheal tube and orogastric tube with tip in the esophagus.
Pelvic x-ray which was without fracture.
A Head CT which was negative.
A C-spine CT with reconstructions that was negative.
An abdominal pelvis CT which is also read as negative initially.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following his initial resuscitation imaging workup the patient was transferred to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Given that the patient was somewhat somnolent he had a repeat head CT performed, this head CT demonstrated one small area of intraparenchymal bleed consistent with diffuse axonal injury verses artifact.
Given the nonspecific findings on CT it was decided to obtain an Magnetic resonance scan, performed on Friday evening [**2149-4-18**] and this magnetic resonance scan was significant for diffuse spinal injury.
For this the neurology service was consulted, felt that the patient's exam was significant for decreased processing speed.
I felt this exam once again consistent with [**Doctor First Name **] verses an acute concussional syndrome.
They recommended an EEG, neuropsych testing and assessment for neurology rehabilitation.
