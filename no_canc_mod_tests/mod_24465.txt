By the time he arrived at [**Hospital3 **] he was again noted to be in PEA arrest with a rate of 170-180 with occasional triplets of PVCs.
He was given 1mg of epi, 1 amp of bicarb and 1g of magnesium (for the ectopy) and he regained a pulse with a SBP of 100 at 9:08 am.
His perfusing rhythm was atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 with reportedly no ischemic changes on his EKG.
The patient was initially vented at AC 500 x 14 with a PEEP of 5 and FiO2 of 100%.
His ABG on this was 7.1 / 52 / 510.
At this point his FiO2 was decreased to 40%, a CXR revealed some scarring at the R base of the patient's lung, also the ET tube was at the carina and was pulled back 2 cm.
The patient was noted to have fixed pupils 4mm bilaterally and was ordered for a CT scan of his chest and head but on the way to the CT scan he was noted to be too unstable with a SBP dropping to 70.
A R femoral line was placed and levophed was initiated, his SBP improved to 100 but given his instability the imaging was not obtained.
Subsequently the patient's O2 sat was noted to be dropping in the 80s, a repeat CXR was performed that was read was mild bibasilar infiltrates vs. atelectasis.
FiO2 was increased to 100% and O2 sat also improved to 100%.
His repeat ABG was 7.22 / 16 / 45 just prior to transport, given his good O2 sat this was thought to be a VBG.
ABG on transfer was 7.29/40/230/19.5.
