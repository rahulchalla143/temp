Mildy enlarged pretracheal, paratracheal, prevascular, precarinal, and subcarinal lymph nodes are identified, the largest of these measuring 1.6 cm in diameter.
Moderate-sized left pleural effusion with associated atelectatic changes [**2119-8-4**] CXR - Persistent right-sided pleural and parenchymal opacities, which could potentially be due to chronic scarring, although an acute process is not excluded without more remote radiographs for comparison.
No significant change since earliest chest x-ray at this institution performed 5 days earlier.
[**2119-8-3**] CXR - Interval increase in pulmonary interstitial edema reflecting likely worsening CHF.
[**2119-8-3**] CT Head - Slight increase in size of extraaxial fluid collection since prior study.
[**2119-8-1**] ECHO - Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
[**2119-7-30**] CXR - Probable right effusion which may be chronic.
[**2119-7-28**] CT Head - Large bilateral subdural hematomas, causing significant local mass effect on the brain parenchyma.
Cultures: [**2119-7-31**] Urine - No growth [**2119-8-3**] Urine - yeast [**2119-7-31**] Blood - No growth [**2119-8-3**] Blood - pending [**2119-7-31**] Stool - negative for c.diff [**2119-8-1**] Stool - negative for c.diff [**2119-8-2**] Stool - negative for c.diff   Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old male admitted on [**2119-7-28**] for evacuation of chronic subdural hematomas, transferred to the MICU on [**2119-8-3**] ago for respiratory distress found to have pulmonary edema and presumptively treating for aspiration PNA.
Repeat CT after hematoma evacuation showed slight increase in size of extraaxial fluid collection and some reduction in the degree of pneumocephalus.
Please, call Dr.[**Name (NI) 9034**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**] and set up a date for CT of head and follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**3-1**] weeks.
A CTA of chest was negative for PE and showed on ground glass consistent with CHF.
CTA of chest also showed mildy enlarged pretracheal, paratracheal, prevascular, precarinal, and subcarinal lymph nodes are identified, the largest of these measuring 1.6 cm in diameter.
A swallow study showed no evidence of aspiration on video swallow.
Regarding mediastinal lymphadenopathy, please compare it to his previous CT of chest and eval for any further workup.
He was gently diuresed as his creatinine would tolerate.
Acute on chronic renal Failure: Pt's baseline creatinine is 1.5 and he was admitted with a cr of 1.7.
Post-op, his creatinine started to rise further and urine output dropped to 20cc/hr; it peaked on HD#4 at 2.4.
Pt received mucomyst and Bicarb prior to CTA but creatinine rose ot 1.7 (from 1.5) after the study.
On day of discharge, his creatinine was returned to baseline at 1.5. .
Leukocytosis: On post-operative day #4, the patient developed a cough, spiked a fever to 102.5 F and his urine output dropped to approximately 20 cc per hour.
As above, he was thought to have an aspiration PNA based on possible opacities on CXR and he was started on levo/flagyl and then switched to ceftriaxone/flagyl.
Blood and urine cx were negative.
Glucose was elevated but controlled with humalog sliding scale.
