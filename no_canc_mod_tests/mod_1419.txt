Ace-I, lasix, statin, NSAIDs and allopurinol all held.
Her LFTs trended down as she was off all these medications.
Liver serologies had been sent and were all negative.

Cr fell to 1.8 by hospital day number 2, and eventually her creatinine came down to 0.9.
UTI- Urinalysis on [**12-4**] showed moderate leukocytes and >50 bacteria, so she was started on a 3 day course of levofloxacin which was completed on [**2166-12-7**].
ID- Urine and blood cultures from admission were negative as were subsequent culture specimens.
Her blood sugars remained fairly well controlled until starting steroids.
Her blood sugars were noted to be >400 on several occasions after starting prednisone, despite increasing her NPH regimen.
Anemia- Given 1U PRBC on [**12-7**] in setting of her liver biopsy when she had a hct of 27 (hct=28 on admission).
Her hematocrit increased appropriately following transfusion and has remained stable at 33.
