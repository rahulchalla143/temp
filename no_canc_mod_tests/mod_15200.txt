He recently completed a steroid taper, and liver biopsy was planned for a few weeks.
Labs drawn as an outpatient showed platelet count to be 35.
Previous platelet count was 44.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: On admission T-max was 98.3, heart rate 84, blood pressure 138/77, respiratory rate 20, 97% on room air.
Hepatitis C and CMV viral load were sent off.
CMV was not detected.
Hepatitis C viral load was 23,100,000 IU/ml.
It was noted that the patient had a bone marrow biopsy in late [**2113**] that showed no evidence of overt myelodysplasia and maturing trilineage erythropoiesis.
It was felt that the fluctuations in his platelet count was reflective of medication changes.
During his hospital course, vital signs remained stable.
White blood cell count ranged between 5.3 and 8.1.
Hematocrit on admission was 38.8.
Platelet count was 106 on admission, and this increased to 135, subsequently decreasing to 100.
Creatinine was stable at 1.0.
LFTs on admission showed an AST of 150, ALT 98, alkaline phosphatase 222, total bilirubin 1.9, with an albumin of 4.8. amylase and lipase were 77 and 18 respectively.
INR was 1.2.
LFTs improved with an AST of 24, ALT 29, alkaline phosphatase 121, total bilirubin 0.9.
Prograf levels were checked.
These levels ranged between 12.5 and 15.3.
Given past history of hepatic artery stricture with stent placement, a cardiac echocardiogram was done.
The right ventricular systolic function also appeared depressed.
Hematocrit post transjugular liver biopsy decreased to 25.7 from 27.
CT scan was done to evaluate for hematoma.
Serial hematocrits were drawn.
Hematocrit increased to 33.2 and a platelet count of 94.
Coags were 12.9 for PT, PTT were 25.7, and INR was 1.1.
His liver biopsy tissue returned with changes consistent with a recurrent viral hepatitis C, grade II inflammation.
He was transferred back to the medical surgical unit where his hematocrit remained stable.
His creatinine remained stable at 1.0.
Vital signs were stable.
