TTE [**2182-7-19**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
[**7-22**] echo The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-7-19**], the findings are similar.
Mitral valve and tricuspid valve inflows show variability which is partly due to atrial fibrillation.
[**2182-7-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion with no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.

# C. dificile colitis Patient and family endorse months to years of intermitent mucousy output from his rectum and new in onset (for the past several weeks) incontinence.
The patient has stool studies sent in house for further work up of opportunistic infectious etiologies of these symptoms and c. diff came back positive.
# Pericardial Effusion:  Echo noted moderate pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
He will have follow up with his CT surgeon.
His anticoagulation was resumed after his GI bleeding was resolved, and his INR was in the therapeutic range on day of [**Month/Day (4) **].
The patient was trialed on single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] metoprolol in house for rate control but this was not effective with HR in the 110-130 range without symptoms.
The inpatient Cardiology team was consulted and they ultimately recommended diliazem 120 CD which improved his rate control.
His heart rate was controlled with diltiazem CD 120 mg po daily and metoprolol tartrate 75 mg po daily.
He had occasional PVCs, so please check his potassium and magnesium at least twice a week (can be done with cyclosporine labs) .
# VOLUME OVERLOAD with a h/o sCHF with recent EF 35-40%: Patient had elevated JVP and periperhal edema, suggestive of elevated R filling pressures.
The transplant team recommends that his cyclosporine levels be checked twice a week, in addition to his renal function.
Please fax the results to his nephrologist, Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 118**], at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9420**].
