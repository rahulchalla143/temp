The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization, after electrocardiogram showed anterolateral ST segment elevation and Q waves.
He was then brought to the hospital where an electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 and lead 2.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 95; blood pressure 128/77; respirations 20; 90% on room air.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT: Extraocular movements intact.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Sodium 141; potassium of 3.3; chloride 104; bicarbonate 21; BUN 23; creatinine 1.2; glucose 183.
White blood cell count of 13.9.
Hematocrit of 43.8.
Platelets 327.
Serial CK's were also followed and were 63 to 58 to 55.
CK MB not performed.
Troponin was less than 0.01; second troponin was .04.
Right atrium mean 10; A wave 15; V wave 12.
Aortic systolic 99, diastolic 73.
PA systolic was 35; diastolic 20; mean of 27.
RV:  Systolic 41; diastolic 3 and 13.
PA systolic 37; diastolic 21; mean 28.
RV systolic 36; diastolic 8 and end 14.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Final angiography demonstrated 0% residual stent type but pruned appearance distal to the left anterior descending, beyond D-2, consistent with extensive previous infarction.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 25%.
Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function would be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.
The patient subsequently developed bradycardia down to the 50's and hypotension with systolic blood pressure of 70.
Blood pressure and heart rate responded with blood pressure rising to 110 over 70 with heart rate of 90.
The patient, by numbers in the catheterization laboratory, showed that he was in heart failure.
Hematocrit remained stable after the third night of admission.
The goal INR was 2 to 3.
The patient was taught how to self administer Lovenox injections and was given appointments to see his primary care physician doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 53425**], for follow-up and INR monitoring.
or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 53426**] for further work-up and possible ICD pacer.
Right groin hematoma remained stable throughout the remainder of his stay.
Outpatient laboratory work slip; INR to be checked every Wednesday and every Saturday.
