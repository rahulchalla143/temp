[**8-31**] CXR IMPRESSION: Subtle patchy opacities likely represent PCP pneumonia in this HIV+ patient.
Underlying meningitis cannot be excluded and follow-up is suggested.
Blood, CSF, and urine cultures remained negative (including for legionella for virus).
Gram stain of sputum was positive for GPC in pairs, and it was felt that patient likley had S.pneumo (although cultures were negative).
MRI was c/w meningitis, but it could not be discerned whether this was viral or bacterial.
Repeat LP before pt transferred to floor showed few white cells and monocyte predominant.
On d/c plt 133.
1) Consider repeat CXR to follow-up your pleural effusions 2) Need to address initiating HAART (anti-retroviral) therapy
