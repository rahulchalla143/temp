Coarse and echogenic liver with multiple hypoechoic regions scattered throughout the liver corresponding to areas of hypodensity seen on today's noncontrast CT scan highly concerning for a widespread neoplastic process.
Contrast-enhanced CT scan or MRI study is recommended for further characterization of these lesions.
CT ABD [**9-21**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT HEAD [**9-21**] IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage or edema.
CXR [**9-23**]: FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**9-22**], there is mild increase in opacification at the right base, consistent with the CT diagnosis of right lower lung pneumonia.
EEG [**2163-9-27**]: Abnormal EEG due to markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the slow disorganized background, the lower voltage background over the left side, and the bursts of generalized slowing.

Peritoneal tap performed which did not fnid evidence of SBP.
Chest CT showed ground glass opacities suspicious for pneumonia, for which patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia (vancomycin and cefepime).
Head CT was negative for acute process.
Abdominal ultrasound found no evidence of clot.
Abdominal CT conducted which was unremarkable.
Because of diffuse liver nodularity appreciated on CT and ultrasound when patient first admitted (as well as known lesion in the past), MRI was conducted, which did not show evidence of HCC.
Diagnostic paracentesis performed which showed no evidence for SBP; other infectious workup was unremarkable.
Speech and swallow followed closely along with a workup including video swallow studies.
