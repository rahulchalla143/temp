In addition, she had some component of tracheal stenosis, and her trach was changed to a Portex #7, which was telescoped through the Y-stent.
Cultures grew acinetobacter and stenotrophomonas for which she received a 14 day course of Bactrim and Unasyn.
Was placed on mechanical ventilation, CXR was unchanged from earlier when daignosed with PNA.
CTA was performed which showed no PE but multifocal PNA, unclear if this is resolving infection from recent PNA or new process.
S/p repeat bronch with BAL yesterday which showed the tracheostomy in place/y-stent in place, scant mucous in airways, no evidence of clear obstruction, moderate distal granulation tissue.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is good (>45%).

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2103-9-30**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2103-10-2**]):       OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # [**Numeric Identifier 76420**]          ([**2103-9-29**]).
On presentation, the patients respiratory distress was thought to be due to proximal airway obstruction with overgrowth of lumenal granulation tissue within the patient's y- stent.
However, this was delayed due to persistent hypoxemia on high levels of Fi02.
Her hypoxemia was evaluated with a CTA on [**2103-9-11**], which revealed no pulmonary emboli, but did show multi-focal pneumonia.
Her sputum grew Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Pseudomonas on BAL.
Due to borderline blood pressures, she was started on a lasix drip and antihypertensives were held.
Recent TTE showed moderate systolic artery hypertension.
Patient had episodes of hypertensive urgency with SBP in 200s while on vent.
