They improved her blood pressure and 12 hours after the onset of symptoms her visual disturbance improved.
She received CT imaging (which "ruled out" stroke), as well as carotid US imaging which showed the presence of a right sided 70% stenosis of the carotid artery.

CXR [**2159-1-17**]: Patchy left base opacity most likely represents atelectasis, although underlying aspiration not excluded.
NCHCT [**2159-1-17**]: Severely limited evaluation due to streak artifact from EEG cables, within those limitations, no large, obvious acute intracranial process.

They improved her blood pressure and 12 hours after the onset of symptoms her visual disturbance improved.
She received CT imaging (which "ruled out" stroke), as well as carotid US imaging which showed the presence of a right sided 70% stenosis of the carotid artery.
EKG was reviewed, sinus with no block, rapid repolarization but no significant ST changes and no TWI.
She remained hemodynamically stable and her AM labs were all within normal limits.
On exam, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with BPs overnight between 90-100 SBP, and satting 93-95% on 2L/nC.
Her neurologic examination was significant for a transcortical motor aphasia with preserved repetition, comprehension, [**Location (un) 1131**] but not writing.
Formal strength testing was symmetric and full and there was no drift.
Given her known morphine pump for lower back pain, an MRI could not be performed.
The pain service was consulted, and they recommended that an MRI not be performed and that her morphine pump not be changed in settings.
To evaluate the cause for her expressive aphasia, she received a NCHCT and CTA head/neck which showed no evidence of an acute stroke, hemorrhage or mass, but did reveal atherosclerotic disease in both carotid arteries (R>L).
On the floor, her exam slowly improved with increased attentiveness but still some decreased fluency of speech.
Her EEG did not show any further seizures.
To further evaluate the cause of seizures, she received a contrast-enhanced Head CT on [**2159-1-20**] which did not reveal any abnormal enhancement.
Her Levetiracetam was decreased with the hopes of reducing her dose to a less sedating standing dose; she was given 500mg on [**2159-1-20**] PM.
Overnight, she had a cluster of short seizures around 0215 with motor manifestations which resolved with lorazepam 1 mg. Around 0630 on [**2159-1-21**], she start to have clinical seizure activity again with left head turn, left eye deviation, and left arm myoclonic jerks which lessened but was followed by left foot myoclonic jerks.
Her seizure started involving right hip/knee flexion, and right arm raise to the nose.
Levetiracetam 1500 mg was bolused, followed by another LZP x 1mg and Fosphenytoin 1000 mg. She was transferred back to the ICU for further monitoring and care for status epilepticus.
The patient's seizures were able to be controlled on two agents.
TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: Patient will need to remain on Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and Vimpat 150mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure control.
2. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or T > 99.
Your other laboratory studies and imaging studies were normal.
