A myocardial perfusion scan back in mid [**Month (only) 359**] showed anteroseptal ischemia with an ejection fraction of 45% - no official report.
Angiography revealed a 70% left main lesion; 60% stenoses of the right coronary and obtuse marginal with a 70% PDA lesion.
Given her critical left main stenosis, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.

Further evaluation with a contrast- enhanced chest CT is recommended.
[**2194-10-6**] CXR Comparison made to prior study of [**2194-10-2**].
[**2194-9-30**] Chest CT 1.
Coronary artery atherosclerosis  [**2194-9-30**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound Moderate plaque with bilateral 40-59% carotid stenosis.
[**2194-9-30**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2194-10-1**] EKG Normal sinus rhythm, rate 82.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2194-9-30**] sinus bradycardia has given way to normal sinus rhythm.
Routine chest x-ray was notable for mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy for which a chest CT scan was obtained.
Other studies included an echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound.
The ECHO showed only mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
The carotid ultrasound revealed moderate plaque with bilateral 40-59% carotid stenoses.
She responded to diuretics and by discharge, she was close to her preoperative weights with room air saturations of 97%.
Results of her chest CT scan to be followed up by her primary care physician.
