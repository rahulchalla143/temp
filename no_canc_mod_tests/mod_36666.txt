It is possible that myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] played a role but her myasthenia does not otherwise appear to be that severe.
Her baseline oxygen saturation levels are likely in the 88-93% range.
Ambulatory oxygen sat was >88% on 2L NC.
for 2 consecutive days with a goal INR of [**3-3**].
Her INR on [**6-5**] was 1.7.
Vital capacity and negative inspiratory force (NIF) were checked here and were -40mm hg and >900cc.
Her last trough cyclosporine level was 71, though below an ideal range of 100-400 the dose is already up from her baseline of 50 [**Hospital1 **] to 75 [**Hospital1 **] and her proximal strength and ptosis are all improved.
Head CT and infectious work-up were unrevealing.
Hypercarbia was a consideration, and goal oxygen sats were lowered.
Her mental status has completely improved for the past 3 days and her wake/sleep cycles are improved as seroquel was started as needed in the evenings for sleep.
UA with 182 RBC, 42 WBC and 10 epi, UTI unlikely.
