The last echocardiogram was in [**2120-1-9**], which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal wall motion and ejection fraction of 60% and a severely stenotic aortic valve with a mean gradient of 43 mmHg and a peak gradient of 65 mmHg.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the blood pressure is 136/65; heart rate 72.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with nonobstructive coronaries and normal pulmonary artery pressures along with a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.
However, that evening, she became tachycardiac to a pulse rate of approximately 120 to 130.
The EKG at that time demonstrated a junctional tachycardia that was narrow complex in nature and very regular.
She did require some intravenous doses of Diltiazem for heart rates between 100 and 110 as her drip was being weaned and her oral doses were taking effect.
