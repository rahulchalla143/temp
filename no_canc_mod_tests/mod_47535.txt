Admitted [**2140-11-14**], with one week of presumed upper respiratory infection, congestive heart failure, pneumonia then developing into acute transaminitis observed when liver function tests were checked.
CT's of the abdomen and high resolution CT of the lungs revealed findings consistent with amiodarone toxicity, unclear etiology.
The patient was discharged on three liters nasal cannula with oxygen saturations at 93%.
The patient will have pulmonary function tests scheduled as an outpatient through his primary care physician.
He had a cholestatic picture with CT findings consistent with amiodarone toxicity.
AST, ALT and total bilirubin trended down throughout the rest of his hospitalization.
Gastroenterology consult at that time determined that patient should have an outpatient endoscopy and colonoscopy but that there was no need to discontinue anticoagulation.
Hematocrit was stable.
The patient's hematocrit was stable and increased appropriately without transfusion in the remaining days of his hospitalization.
Infectious Disease:  The patient had an elevated white blood cell count that persisted between 14 and 16,000.
His differential revealed no shift.
Antibiotics were held and white blood cell count remained unchanged.
All blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum cultures remain negative to date.
The white blood cell count elevation was thought to be non-infectious and would be monitored upon discharge.
The patient had a Persantine MIBI study that revealed no evidence of ischemia as the cause of his global hypokinesis found on echocardiogram.
When he was transferred to the floor the echocardiogram revealed that he had an ejection fraction of 20-25%.
EKGs revealed a left bundle branch block and AV paced rhythm.
For his pump, his ejection fraction was greater than 55% on admission with likely a component of diastolic dysfunction that dropped to 20-25% on admission with global hypokinesis.
The patient was maintained on a two gram sodium diet, a 1.5 liter fluid restriction and afterload reduction was pursued.
Renal:  The patient had a history of chronic renal insufficiency with proteinuria at baseline with a baseline creatinine of 2.3 likely thought to be due to hypertension and diabetes.
The patient continued to have normal urine output and urine output improved with continued blood pressure management with ACE inhibitors.
Renal consult followed the patient throughout his entire admission and patient's creatinine was at his baseline of 2.3 on discharge.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  His electrolytes were monitored daily and repleted.
