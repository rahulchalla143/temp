Catheterization revealed totally occluded left anterior descending artery with brachytherapy.
Echocardiogram in [**2128-11-14**] showed an ejection fraction of 50%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hypokinetic anterior wall and kinetic anteroseptal wall, hypokinetic anterior apex, akinetic septal apex, and lateral apex and akinetic apex, 1+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient was admitted to an outside hospital for a GI bleed, where aspirin and Plavix were discontinued upon the outside hospital.
Electrocardiogram was 3-[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations in leads V2 through V4.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 16.5, hematocrit 29.7, platelets 250.
Sodium 140, potassium 3.8, chloride 107, CO2 23, BUN 11, creatinine 0.6, glucose 97, calcium 8, phosphate 4, magnesium 1.6.
A postcatheterization electrocardiogram showed atrial flutter/fibrillation, left axis deviation, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in V2 through V4, T-wave inversions in V2 through VI, poor R-wave progression.
VITALS ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.0, heart rate is 82, blood pressure 98/48, respiratory rate 16, and oxygen 94% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
EP was consulted to assess the need for further EP studies and also defibrillator placement.
Pump:  The patient had repeat echocardiogram in-house, which showed an ejection fraction of 25-35% reduced from the 50% before.
She had no need for blood and her hematocrit was stable.
