Limited evaluation of the liver and gallbladder due to difficulty with patient positioning and interference with existing feeding tube.
Aside for gallbladder distention, no definite secondary signs of acute cholecystitis, but exam is suboptimal.
EEG [**2102-2-22**] This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of continuous spike and wave and polyspike and wave discharges, ranging from [**4-11**] Hz, some of which correlate with myoclonic jerk of the body on video.

He had a PEA arrest, was intubated, and was transferred to the MICU.
