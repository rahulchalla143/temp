Micro: UCx negative BCx [**2144-5-20**] NTD x 2 .
ECG Study Date of [**2144-5-20**]  8:48:24 PM Supraventricular tachycardia, probably sinus tachycardia.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2144-5-21**] 1:52 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-19**], there is again some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
ECHO [**2144-5-21**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-9-25**], the left ventricular severe systolic dysfunction appears more global.
ECG Study Date of [**2144-5-22**]  8:15:30 AM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2144-5-20**] the rate is slower.
Brief Hospital Course: 39 yo M with premature CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF with EF 35%, s/p PM/ICD for VT who presents with VT and his ICD firing.
His QTc was 451 upon discharge.
His PA/LAT CXR showed no signs of infiltrate.
His UA and UCx were clear.
His blood cultures from [**5-20**] were NTD upon discharge.
Suspect fevers were from viral infection, possibly pneumonia.
We were unable to obtain flu DFA or stool cultures during his stay.
His ACE-I was decreased to 20mg qday because of SBP in the 90s intermittently with the new regimen.
# Chronic Systolic heart failure: known systolic dysfunction with LVEF 35% on ECHO [**9-17**].
Your medication regimen was changed to improve control of your heart rate and rhythm.
There was no pneumonia by repeat chest xray, so the antibiotic was stopped.
Your urine was negative for infection and blood cultures have been negative thus far.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
