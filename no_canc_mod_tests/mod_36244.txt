Labs revealed a relative anemia (Hct 27, from 38 during prior admission), which prompted a CT Torso, which revealed a large right retroperitoneal hematoma with active contrast extravasation.

He was transfused 7u PRBC, 4u FFP, 1 bag Plts; received one dose of recombinant Factor VIIa as well as Vitamin K; and achieved stabilization of the Hct at 30 (up from 24) and correction of the INR from 5.6 to 1.0.
The hematocrits remained stable for 24 hours, as did his hemodynamics.
Cardiac enzymes were elevated, although within range status-post CPR, and a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a preserved ejection fraction with no focal wall motion abnormalities.
He did receive 2 additional units of PRBCs on HD 3 for a Hct of 26, with response to Hct 30.
Throughout his course he was making ~20cc/hr of urine but had gradually worsening renal failure, with creatinine rising from 2.3 on admission (was 1.0 on prior admission) to 4.2 on HD 5.
