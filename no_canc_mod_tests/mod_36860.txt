CT scan showed marked destruction of her sinuses c/w old surgical procedures but infectious cause could not be excluded.
Neurology evaluated the patient and felt her picture was more consistent with an infectious etiology but suggested an acute MRI to exclude CVA.
ENT was consulted who felt the CT was suggestive of an acute vs chronic sinusitis but noted that this was unlikely to cause her neurologic symptoms.
Her telemetry showed a NSR with intermittant runs of a rate related LBBB that had been seen previously in [**7-23**].
On the floor, her exam was significant for a ?
She received her MRI soon after reaching the floor which showed multiple acute infarctions present within the left frontal lobe and another within the right amygdala that were thought to be c/w either embolic or watershed strokes.
TEE showed no vegetations, no asd/vsd and a bubble study was negative.
An area of hyperintensity within the left frontal lobe is much more pronounced on today's examination compared to the exam from [**2116-3-11**].
MRA:  Time-of-flight imaging demonstrates no flow within the carotid arteries intracranially, again similar to the findings from [**2116-3-11**]."
This was performed, with precautions to keep HOB flat, maintain good hydration with IVF, and keep sbp>160 and avoiding sharp drops in blood pressure in the postoperative period.
On [**3-15**], head CT was performed for decreased responsivenss.
During the day of [**3-16**], the patient's pupils ceased to be reactive and an emergent head CT was obtained.
