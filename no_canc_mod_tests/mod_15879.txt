She denied abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, vomiting, sick contacts but has had chills.
She received 4 liters of normal saline for hypotension (systolic blood pressure of 92).
Congestive heart failure, her last echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on presentation revealed temperature 96.8, heartrate 83, blood pressure 89/64, respiratory rate 18 to 20.
Oxygen saturation was 94 to 95% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric, normal conjunctivae, pupils equal, round and reactive to light from 4 ml to 2.5 ml.
Lungs, decreased excursion, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Vascular, radial, carotid and dorsalis pedis pulses +2 bilaterally.

Chemistry, 128/7.7, 89/20, 100/4.2, glucose 140.
Repeat chemistry panel revealed sodium 133, potassium 6.2, chloride 95, bicarbonate 22.
Blood urea nitrogen 95, creatinine 3.9, glucose 125.
ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total bilirubin, amylase and lipase and INR were normal.
Urinalysis was unremarkable.
Urine electrolytes, sodium less than 10, urea nitrogen 233, urine creatinine 202, urine potassium 65, urine chloride less than 10.
Fractional excreted sodium was less than 0.1%.
Electrocardiogram, sinus at 82, PR interval less than 200 milliseconds, QRS interval was less than 120 milliseconds and the QT interval was 416 seconds.
Axis was left with qR in leads 1 and AVL and a rS in 2, 3 and F. There were no peak T waves, there was no acute ST segment change.
Following rehydration her BUN and creatinine returned to [**Location 213**] and she had normal renal function for the duration of the hospital course.
Upon arrival in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient's serial blood gases revealed hypercarbia and hypoxia.
She received several boluses of fluids to maintain blood pressure.
Ultimately she required administration of pressors to maintain her blood pressure.
She had large volumes of diarrhea as well as increased nasogastric suctioning contents.
Her white blood cell count remained elevated for the duration of her hospital course.
Interval colonoscopy confirmed the presence of pseudomembranes, likewise computer tomograph evaluation of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed involvement on the entire large colon.
Hypotension - The patient had persistent hypotension during her hospital course.
She underwent Swan-Ganz catheterization which confirmed distributed and cardiogenic shock.
The patient was unable to tolerate weaning from pressor agents, specifically requiring Dopamine for the duration of her hospital stay to maintain blood pressure.
Of note, the patient was exquisitely sensitive to withdrawal of this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] and would have precipitous drop in her blood pressure as well as bradycardia upon its discontinuation.
Sputum cultures confirmed that she had pneumonia with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus although she was initially treated with Levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia, the intravenous Vancomycin administered as part of the regimen for Clostridium difficile covered for this organism.
Congestive heart failure, her last echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45%.
