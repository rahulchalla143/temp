Left Heart Cath on previous admission ([**2173-2-15**]): Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system.
The LMCA, LAD and LCx were all non-obstructed with no evidence for flow-limiting stenoses.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a mildly elevated central aortic pressure (systolic 145mmHg).
Cath [**2173-2-25**]:   1.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated single vessel disease.
The LMCA, LAD, and LCX were angiographically normal vessels.
EKG showed non-specific TW flattening in the inferior leads.
