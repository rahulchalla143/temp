[**Age over 90 **]M anesthesiologist h/o CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 45%), pAF s/p pacemaker for tachy-brady syndrome, AS and MR, CRI, esophageal stricture s/p PEG, and recent PNA c/b C diff, transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] with abdominal pain [**1-9**] known CDiff colitis.
Three days prior to admission, pt developed T 103.9, vomiting and was admitted to OSH, where CXR showed RLL PNA (recurrent vs persistent) with positive C. diff toxin.
Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] underwent a CT scan chest/abd/pelvis w/o contrast today which showed new ascites, cholelithiasis, B renal cysts, subcutaneous edema, an IM lipoma, and no obvious source of abdominal pain.
Of note, pt had been transfused 2 units PRBC given decreased hematocrit of 27 from baseline 32, in the setting of chronically guaiac-positive stools.

# CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST, CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST [**2139-8-1**] 1:13 AM CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no axillary adenopathy.
AP window lymph nodes measure up to 1.3 cm in size.
Examination of soft tissue windows also demonstrates marked vascular calcifications involving the aortic arch as well as the descending thoracic aorta.
Examination of lung windows demonstrates a patency of the central airways in the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Allowing for non-contrast technique, the liver is unremarkable.
Multiple low-density lesions are seen arising from both kidneys, many of which have attenuation characteristics consistent with simple cysts, but others which are too small to accurately characterize.
A trace of ascites is present.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: Bowel and bladder appear unremarkable, with a Foley catheter draining the bladder.
Examination of osseous structures does not show lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancy.
Contrast administered for a recent CAT scan is seen through the large bowel into the sigmoid colon.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2139-8-4**] 2:54 PM The examination on this [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man was performed to evaluate chest and exclude recurrent pneumonia.
# RENAL U.S.  [**2139-8-4**] 3:34 PM FINDINGS: Comparison is made to upper quadrant ultrasound [**8-1**], [**2138**] and CT torso [**2139-8-1**].
The left kidney measures 9.6 cm and also contains a 1.8 cm simple cyst.
Doppler examination is limited given patient's inability to hold his breath.
# PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2139-8-4**] 2:54 PM FINDINGS: There are no dilated small bowel loops.
Contrast from the previous CT scan is still present in the large bowel, not appreciably advanced compared to the prior study.
# CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2139-8-5**] 2:39 PM FINDINGS: Cardiac size remains enlarged with extensive coronary artery calcifications in three vessels as well as aortic calcifications.
Non-contrast evaluation of the liver is unremarkable.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Non-contrast enhanced evaluation of the rectum, sigmoid colon, seminal vesicles is unremarkable.
Patchy retrocardiac opacity is slightly worse compared to the previous study and reflects underlying atelectasis and/or consolidation.

INTERPRETATION: Findings:  This study was compared to the prior study of [**2138-1-13**].
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-1-13**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is reduced, the aortic [**Year (4 digits) **] orifice area is further reduced; the mitral and [**Year (4 digits) **] regurgitation are significantly increased.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] M anesthesiologist w/ PMh s/f CAD, GIB, CRI, esophageal stricture, moderate AS, and recent PNA c/b C diff transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] with abdominal pain, expired [**2139-8-9**].
# Abdominal pain: Pt's abdominal pain was considered likely secondary to C. diff colitis, given postive stool cultures and recent treatment with antibiotics, although CT abdomen and pelvis did not show evidence of overt bowel pathology.
DDx also included possible mesenteric ischemia given known low EF, but lactate levels were within normal limits.
Furosemide was held and pt initially was aggressively hydrated with NS boluses and a basal rate, with some improvement of Cr but no improvement of urine output.
Urine lytes demonstrated prerenal etiology, renal ultrasound demonstrated poor diastolic flow in bilateral renal arteries.
Echo demonstrated end-stage heart failure with significant mitral regurgitation, [**Name (NI) **] regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and L ventricular hypomobility, likely a significant factor in his low urine output.
# UTI: Pt's repeat urine culture was positive for yeast, and pt was started on fluconazole for treatment, until he was made [**Name (NI) 3225**], after which it was removed.
# Aortic stenosis: Echo demonstrated end-stage heart failure, with significant MR, TR, and AS, as well as LV hypomobility.
# DNR/DNI  Medications on Admission: Acetaminophen 650mg Q6H PRN Fentanyl patch 50mcg Fluconazole 100mg daily Furosemide 20mg daily Heparin SC 5000mcg TID Levothyroxine 25mg daily Metoclopramide 10mg daily Morphine 2-4mg Q4H PRN MVI Percocet-5 Q6H PRN Pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] Simethicone 80mg QID NaCl nasal spray Vancomycin 125mg PO Q6H Water 250ml NGT TID Zolpidem 10mg QHS PRN Atrovent 0.5mg Q4H PRN Albuterol nebs PRN TID Piperacillin-tazobactam 2.25g Q6H  Discharge Medications: Expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Expired   Discharge Condition: Expired   Discharge Instructions: Expired  Followup Instructions: Expired   Completed by:[**2139-8-10**
