Medicine Team HPI on [**2192-12-11**] upon transfer to floor which partly summarizes hospital course prior to transfer Briefly, patient is a 55M with hx of morbid obesity, type II DM, OSA on BiPAP, with a very complicated 2 month hospital course s/p Cardiac Arrest on [**11-21**] transferred to the unit for MRSA HAP.
He also had a Hct drop with no clear source and had a negative abdominal CT. His Hct has been stable at 25.
Pt initially presented on [**9-13**] with acute change in MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] weakness, and was found to have bilateral thalamic, and L cerebral peduncle infarcts, transferred to the floor and discharged to rehab (see prior DC summary for details related to initial hospital course).
Cultures grew MRSA and VRE.
CT abd showed large fluid collection.
CT abd on [**10-30**] again showed an organizing fluid collection R hepatic flex to pelvis and on [**10-31**] the collection was drained.
He also had sputum cultures on [**10-27**] and [**10-28**] with MRSA.
In addition CT scan [**2192-11-6**] to evaluate his fluid collections showed an SMV clot.
Hematology was consulted and hypercoag labs were sent and he was anticoagulated with heparin bridged to COumadin.
Following intubation he suffered a cardiac arrest with pulseless VT responding to epi X3.
He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**11-21**] with cultures growing coag + staph.
A wound culture from [**11-27**] grew e.coli and enterococcus and Zosyn was added to his regimen on [**11-30**].
Later he was sent for a repeat CT Torso to evaluate for potential worsening of his abscess.
He was not hypotensive and an ABG confirmed the lack of acidosis.
He also had a Hct drop with no clear source and had a negative abdominal CT. His Hct has been stable at 25 for two days at time of transfer.

C diff negative x 3 Blood cultures (including mycolytic) from [**1-5**] x 2, [**1-6**] x 2 NGTD All other blood cultures have been negative  STUDIES Echo [**2192-12-22**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-11-23**], the findings are similar.
[**2192-12-23**] CXR FINDINGS: Two AP views.
Lung volumes are low.
Comparison is made with the previous study done [**2192-12-19**].
Non contrast Head CT [**2192-11-12**] FINDINGS: There are [**Hospital1 **]-thalamic hypodensities, and left mid brain hypodensity, consistent with the site of the patient's previous infarcts, as demonstrated on the previous examination of [**9-14**], [**2192**].
CT Abdomen Pelvis [**2192-10-24**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Torso [**2192-12-6**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT ABdomen/Pelvis [**2192-12-14**] IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE [**2193-1-7**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

He now presents after evaluation at an outside hospital that showed a significant amount of free air on an upright chest x-ray.
Blood loss was 150 ml and patient resuscitated with almost 4 liters of crystalloids.
He was immediately transferred to trauma surgical intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring and recovery.
bronch [**10-27**]: sputum Cx with GPC in pt with hx of Hosp Acquired PNA - Vanc started, [**10-28**]: reintubated secondary to large amount of secretions which patient was unable to clear, on vancomycin, zosyn for hosptial aquired pneumonia [**10-31**]: intrabdominal fluid collection tapped by ultrasound, diuresis to continue; spontaneous breathing trial tolerated for an hour and a half [**11-1**]: successfully extubated [**11-2**]:[**Month (only) **] TF 80/hr, NaCl nebs [**11-4**]: continue aggressive diuresis, no bronch [**11-9**]: failed swallow eval, switched back to PO lasix, coumadin 10mg started for SMV thrombus [**11-12**]: therapeutic on coumadin, dose decreased to 5mg [**Date range (1) 57528**]: Tube feeds continued.
INR goal= [**3-18**].
INR 4.4, Coumadin dose decreased to 1mg.
He developed tachypnea, O2 sats 70s on bipap, 80s on facemask, 90s NRB and HR 120s on arrival to unit.
CXR was without supporting evidence.
Sputum Cultures grew MRSA however it was felt that this was likely a tracheo-bronchitis rather than a true PNA.
Further imaging was not able to be obtained while the patient was intubated in the unit, however this information was conveyed to the floor team at the time of transfer.
The patient presented to the MICU with a supratherapeutic INR in the setting of Coumadin and Levaquin use.
A wound culture from [**11-27**] grew e.coli and enterococcus and Zosyn was added to his regimen on [**11-30**].
Pt triggered [**11-29**] for RR 30's-40s, 94%on 2L.
CXR did show possible retrocardiac infiltrate but without cough and white count aspiration PNA or HAP is unlikely.
Subsequent CXRs in the following days were negative, and pt remained stable on RA (and no futher episodes of triggers until day of transfer to MICU on [**12-7**])      Concerning the pt's anemia, iron studies c/w ACD (ferritin 801, iron 15).
Pt had prior transfusion with Hct 20s, Pt's Hct dropped to 23.2 on [**12-4**], and received 1u PRBC on the [**12-4**].
Once there was some improvement and pt was able to communicate Neuro was consulted, who did not believe the pt has anoxic brain injury [**3-17**] cardiac arrest.
He was sent for a repeat CT torso.
He was not hypotensive and an ABG confirmed the lack of acidosis.
CT abdomen did not reveal any new bleeding and showed fluid collection.
He had bleeding from this ulcer which resulted in a hematocrit drop and he was transfused.
His heparin drip was held for [**2-15**] days while we ensured his hematocrit remained stable and he no longer required transfusions.
Once hematocrit was stable and he did not have any further episodes of bleeding, heparin drip was restarted since benefits of anticoagulation outweighed risks.
He will likely need lifelong anticoagulation given venous and arterial clots and should have INR followed closely on Coumadin with goal INR [**3-18**].
Intra-abdominal abscess: For his intra-abdominal abscess (E. coli, VRE) repeat CT was obtained which did not show any new collections.
DM 2: For his Type 2 diabetes, he was continued on Lantus which was uptitrated for improved glycemic control and he was continued on humalog sliding scale with good glycemic control.
He did not have any further episodes of bleeding x 2 weeks prior to discharge and hematocrit remained stable.
Hematocrit remained stable.
TTE was obtained which did not show any vegetations.
Blood and mycolytic cultures were obtained on [**1-6**] and showed no growth at time of discharge.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed.
Outpatient Lab Work Please have CBC and LFTs checked twice per week while you are on antibiotics.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Outpatient Lab Work INR should be checked daily until stabilized in therapeutic range of 2.0-3.0.
Your dose of this medication may need to be adjusted based on blood levels which need to be followed very closely.
We added Coumadin, a blood thinning medication 3.
-Try to maintain ostomy output between 1000mL to 1500mL per day.
-If Ostomy output >1 liter, take 4mg of Imodium, repeat 2mg with each episode of loose stool.
