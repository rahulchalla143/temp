Chest x-ray was negative for rib fractures.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination he had a temperature of 97.2, heartrate 89, blood pressure 130/85, respirations 30 and breathing 95% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies were notable for white blood cell count of 12.1, hematocrit 48, platelets 162.
Chem-7 was notable for a sodium of 140, potassium 5.7, chloride 103, bicarbonate 21, BUN 82 and creatinine 3.6 with a baseline approximately 1.0 and glucose of 286.
Calcium was 9.6, magnesium 2.6, phosphate 4.7.
The ALT was 1,233, AST 2,119, alkaline phosphatase 92, total bilirubin 4.2, amylase 54, lipase 44, albumin 3.3, creatinine kinase was 1795, MB 21 and MB index 4.2 and troponins were 2.7.
Urine cultures were also drawn.
Chest x-rays were showing stable cardiomegaly with increased opacities of both lung bases, suggesting pneumonia.
Cardiac enzymes were continued to be cycled.
His INR continued to rise during his hospitalization.
He was given boluses of 250 cc of normal saline, smaller boluses were given given the patient's known congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of approximately 10%.
It should be noted that prior to that his urine output dropped to 0.
A cuff blood pressure was unable to be obtained as well as wide complex bradycardia.
He was given a shock at 360 joules and then returned to sinus rate in the 60s.
A femoral arterial line was obtained and the blood pressure was measured to be in the 30s to 40s systolic.
Vasopressin was started and blood pressure was then in the 70s to 80s systolic with a mean atrial pressure in the 60s.
The patient was pseudostabilized on Vasopressor two hours with arterial blood gases which were improving.
Echocardiogram was obtained to rule out tamponade, there was no tamponade effusion or global akinesis.
Again he coded and received Atropine times two, Epinephrine one with improvement in pulse and respiration.
Repeat arterial blood gases post the arrest was pH of 7.1, pCO2 20 and pO2 of 215 on an assist control vent with a title volumes of 600 and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 and respiratory rate 30 with an FIO2 of 50%.
