Resting measurements revealed pulmonary wedge pressure of 20, cardiac index of 1.7.
Echocardiogram done on [**2127-1-13**] demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe inferior posterior hypokinesis and akinesis.
Temperature max was 98.7, 123/50, 93, 24, and 90% with a face mask.
Chest examination lungs showed coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
The abdominal examination was soft, nondistended, nontender.
Rectal examination was guaiac negative.
The dorsalis pedis pulse on the right was biphasic.
The dorsalis pedis pulse on the right was palpable and absent posterior tibial pulse.
LABORATORIES IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM:  White blood cell count of 4.3, hematocrit of 30.6, BUN 66, creatinine 1.6, K 5.0, PT/INR were normal.
Electrocardiogram was without ischemic changes.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] followed the patient for cardiac care.
Initial arteriogram planed for [**1-27**] was deferred secondary to the patient's elevated BUN of 2.7.
Her Lasix was held and serial creatinines were obtained.
Her [**Last Name (un) **] and ace inhibitors were held and diuretics were held and her beta blockers were held for a systolic blood pressure less then 100.
The abdominal MRA showed a mild and distal abdominal aorta appears to be within normal limits.
The dorsalis pedis pulse is diseased, but of good caliber.
With intravenous hydration and holding her diuretics and ace an ABRs the creatinine showed a significant improvement and over the next 48 hours she returned to baseline.
The patient developed a total white blood cell count of 32.3.
The patient had blood urine sputum cultures obtained all which were negative.
The chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe consolidation/collapse with worsening left sided pleural effusion.
White blood cell count over the next several days improved after aggressive pulmonary care.
Her white blood cell count on [**2-4**] was 17.9, hematocrit 30.9, platelets 392K, BUN 90, creatinine 1.7, K 4.6.
The patient underwent a left leg arteriogram on [**2127-2-3**], which demonstrated patent BK popliteal, diseased AT at the origin, tibial peroneal trunk was diseased.
Post angiogram the patient's renal function remained stable without an increase in her creatinine.
On discharge her white blood cell count was 21.3, hematocrit 30.9, platelets 430K, sodium 144, potassium 5.2, chloride 109, CO2 23, BUN 88, creatinine 1.8.
hold for systolic blood pressure less then 100, heart rate less then 55, albuterol nebulizers q 4 to 6 hours prn, Protonix 40 mg q day, and Percocet tablets one to two q 4 hours prn for pain.
