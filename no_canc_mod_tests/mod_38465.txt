RUE Duplex: Duplex evaluation was performed of the right upper extremity arterial system.
Left ventricular systolic function  is probably grossly preserved but views are technically suboptimal.
CT  TOrso: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  No mediastinal hematoma is identified.
There is prominent mediastinal fat as well as prominence of the brachiocephalic vessels, which could explain the mediastinal widening seen on the prior chest radiograph.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  A simple cyst measuring 4.7 cm is present at the upper pole of the right kidney.
The adrenal glands, spleen, atrophic pancreas, and liver are within normal limits.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder, prostate gland, and rectum are within normal limits.
CT head:  :  No definite evidence for acute intracranial pathology including signs of hemorrhage or infarction.
Given that this patient has multiple old areas of infarction and obvious areas of atherosclerosis within the cerebral vasculature, an MRI with diffusion would be a more sensitive test to evaluate for acute infarction.
Continued hep gtt until INR theraputic.
D/C'd on coumadin 13mg nightly for goal INR 2.5-3.5.
A on CRI:  Pt's creatinine increased from baseline ~2.0 to 4.1.
GFR improving, but may have new baseline.
