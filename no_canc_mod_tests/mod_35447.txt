Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team and underwent abdominal CT imaging showing extensive small bowel and cecal pneumatosis and dilatation, with portal venous air and possible rectal hemorrhage and small intra-abdominal ascites, consistent with bowel infarct.
His rate was eventually controlled and the Diltiazem drip was stopped.
His heart rate at time of discharge ranged within the low to mid 70's.
It should also be mentioned that at time of admission he was noted with a sacral wound that is 3 x 0.5 x 1 cm with approx 0.25 cm of undermining around periphery; the peri wound tissue is badly macerated and there are skin tags adjacent to the wound.
