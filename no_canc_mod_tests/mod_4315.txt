EKG from [**Hospital1 **]: EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST segment changes.
EKG from [**Hospital1 18**]: EKG from [**Hospital1 18**] showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, TWI in V1 and flat in V2, V3.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-11-16**], extensive regional wall motion abnormalities are new and pulmonary pressure is higher.
Her arms were significantly painful to the touch, particularly when using a blood pressure cuff.
On admission her cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated and this was of unclear significant.
She underwent repeat echocardiogram on [**2175-1-26**] which revealed extensive new regional wall motion abnormalities compared with her previous study in [**2174-11-7**].
Echocardiographic appearance did not suggest a hyperacute infarct.
On hospital day [**2-9**] her cardiac enzymes were stable with a troponin in the range of 0.3.
On hospital day four she was noted to have an increase in her troponin to 0.84 which peaked at 0.9.
Acute Renal Failure:  On the morning of hospital day four the patient was noted to have developed acute renal failure with increase in her creatinine from 1.7 to 3.6.
She had a renal ultrasound which was negative for obstruction.
Her urine electrolytes were consistent with prerenal azotemia.
On the day of her expiration repeat urine culture also grew gram negative rods.
Blood cultures taken on her final hospital day are negative at the time of this discharge.
