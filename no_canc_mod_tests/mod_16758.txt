He was originally seen at the [**Hospital 1558**] Hospital where he was admitted and found to have a left scalp abrasion that was sutured, a left clavicle fracture, left rib fractures and a head CT scan that did not show any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
His next CT scan was also negative for fracture.
The pain was controlled there with percocet and he was cleared by Physical Therapy for discharge home with a creatinine of 2.4 at discharge.
At home, however, he was unable to carry out his activities of daily living, became short of breath and was brought to an outside hospital Emergency Room where his CK was noted to be 2456 and he was noted to have a troponin T of 2.4, creatinine of 3.5, and had an O2 saturation of only 81% on five liters nasal cannula.
An echocardiogram was carried out which showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45% and an arterial blood gas at the outside hospital showed a pH of 7.32, with pCO2 of 48 and a pO2 of 50.
A chest CT scan demonstrated right upper lobe and right lower lobe consolidation consistent with bronchopulmonary pneumonia thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
Again, a head CT scan was negative.
Given the patient's white blood cell count elevation, infiltrate and hypoxia, he was given one gram of ceftriaxone, aspirin for positive cardiac enzymes and morphine sulfate for pain and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further care.
The patient was noted to have unequal blood pressures in his arms and a transthoracic echocardiogram was carried out to rule out dissection.
The transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no evidence of aortic or thoracic dissection and showed mile regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with posterior and apical hypokinesis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs with temperature of 98.0 F.; blood pressure 122/65; pulse 102; respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation 84% on room air and increased to 97 to 100% on a nonrebreather.
Two plus dorsalis pedis and radial pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 22.1, hematocrit 40.5, platelets 298.
Sodium 138, potassium 5.2, chloride 103, bicarbonate 24, BUN 41, creatinine 3.4 and glucose is 117.
CK is 2427, with an MB of 133 and a troponin T of 3.41.
EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with normal axis and intervals and chamber size.
Chest x-ray demonstrates minimally displaced rib fractures within the fifth, sixth and seventh left ribs posteriorly as well as a depressed fracture of the left clavicle which is displaced inferiorly by the width of the bone.
The patient was bolused with a total of two liters of normal saline with improvement of his systolic blood pressure to 100 to 105 and the patient was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
On readmission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he had an O2 saturation of 80% on six liters via nasal cannula.
He was transferred to a 50% face mask where his arterial blood gas was found to be 7.34/44/55.
The patient was monitored on Telemetry and was noted to undergo atrial fibrillation at a rate of 140 on the [**10-10**] with V4 through V6 ST depressions of 1 mm.
Transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation, mildly depressed ejection fraction with posterior / apical hypokinesis and no evidence of dissection.
Furthermore, the transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global hypokinesis.
The patient's CK was 2427 on admission and peaked at 2551 on the [**10-8**], after which point it trended downward to 575 on the [**10-13**].
His CK MB was 133 on admission and declined consistently throughout his hospitalization.
His CK MB was 5 on the [**10-13**].
His troponin T was 3.41 on admission and increased to a maximum of 5.22 on the [**10-12**].
Persantine MIBI was carried out on the [**10-15**] and did not demonstrate any significant ischemic ST segment changes.
Diffuse hypokinesis and depressed ejection fraction of approximately 30% was noted.
The patient was initially taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on the [**10-23**], but was unable to undergo the procedure at that time secondary to mental status changes and the cardiac catheterization was deferred to a later date.
RENAL:  The patient was noted to have an elevated creatinine of 3.4 on admission.
His creatinine steadily declined during the course of his hospitalization from the maximum of 3.4 on admission to a baseline of between 2.2 and 2.4.
Renal ultrasound was carried out on the [**10-7**] and revealed diffusely increased echogenicity of the renal parenchyma bilaterally consistent with chronic parenchymal disease.
Overall, the study was consistent with arterial vascular disease.
An ammonia level was checked and was found to be 27.
A CT scan of the head was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Repeat TSH on the 19th revealed a level of 45.
His repeat TSH and thyroid studies will be carried out four weeks after this was initiated.
