Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-2-22**], regurgitant native mitral valve is no longer present, replaced by a bioprosthesis.

Postoperative platelet count dropped as low as 69K.
Ultrasound revealed a left cephalic vein thrombus extending to the confluence with the subclavian vein.
Further evaluation included a lower extremity ultrasound which found no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
Postop course was also complicated by significant fluid overload and heart failure which temporarily required intravenous Lasix drip.
White count peaked to 17K, and he was empirically treated with Vancomycin.
By discharge, his white count normalized and his sternal drainage improved.
Warfarin should be dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0.
