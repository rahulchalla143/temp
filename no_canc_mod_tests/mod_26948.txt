She had another admission on [**2116-10-29**] for chest pain and was found to have [**12-18**]+ bld cx for strep viridans and an eccho which revealed AV endocarditis.
She got CT wet read "1.7 cm high density focus in left cerebral whiet matter vs. cortex.
HCT 22 from 29 on admission (27 at OSH).
INR was 1.2 with normal platelets.
NG lavage showed bright red blood.
Lungs: CTA b/l anteriorly Abd: Obese, distended slightly.
There is bandage over right heal Neuro: Could not assess CN as pt was non-cooperative with exam and lethargic.

RUE Ultrasound: ([**2200-11-14**]): No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity  TTE ([**2200-11-15**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular systolic function appears grossly preserved in suboptimal views.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
CT ABD/PELVIS ([**2200-11-16**]) 1.
While some of the distal small bowel loops are distended with air/fluid levels, oral contrast reaches the rectum without evidence of bowel obstruction.
CXR ([**2200-11-16**]): Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation with interval worsening at the right base.
Bilateral foot x-ray ([**2200-11-17**]): 1.
Surveillance blood cultures were negative for strep viridans; however she was found to have ecoli bacteremia which was sensitive to meropenem.
Repeat echocardiogram at [**Hospital1 18**] did not show evidence of endocartidis.
Ecoli bacteremia: Ms [**Known lastname 21822**] was noted on [**11-15**] to have [**1-18**] + bld cx for Ecoli.
Repeat surveillance cultures were negative.
CT abdomen was negative, urine did not reveal E coli; abd/pelvis CT scan was negative; podiatry felt her heel ulcers were not the source.
Plan was for repeat TFTs in [**3-20**] weeks to determine the need for increased dosing.
Coronary artery disease: The patient had been on a beta-[**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ACEI and ASA.
Atrial fibrillation: During the admission, the patient was intermittantly in atrial fibrillation; at times were rate would increase to the 120s so, once her blood pressure stabilized, she was rate controlled with a beta-[**First Name3 (LF) 7005**].
An ultrasound was performed on [**11-14**] and did not show any evidence of DVT.
During most of her admission, her blood pressures were in the low 100s.
As above, a BB (and later a CCB) were used for rate control.
Her BP remained stable thereafter.
