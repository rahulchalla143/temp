Picc line placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 32457**] is a 37 yo F with h/o Ulcerative Colitis, Primary sclerosing cholangitis with ESLD s/p 2 liver transplants in [**2161-3-26**], with the second transplant complicated by neurocognificant defects attributed to cerebral edema, and biopsy in [**2165**] performed for increasing alk phos showing PSC recurrence.
All cultures and tests were negative and she improved from the gastroenteritis.
She then was admitted at Eastern [**State 1727**] for a second time on [**3-20**] - [**3-25**] with fever 104.5 and blood pressure 90/50.
There the workup reportedly included: neg u/a, WBC=6.9, Hct 35.4, cchem 139/4.5/24/22/0.76.
CXR and Head CT were both negative (however, reports are not with patient).
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], initial VS: 99.0, 84, 118/67, 16 99 RA.
CT scan showed bowel wall thickening involving mainly the sigmoid and rectum, and to a lesser degree the cecum and ascending colon in addition to small locules of air in liver which may represent pneumobilia.
Past Medical History: * ESLD secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis, s/p living unrelated donor transplant in [**3-/2161**] which failed (thrombosed) leading to second transplant complicated by tracheostomy, feeding tube, and cerebral edema requiring VP shunt * IBD - UC diagnosed [**2156**] after p/w bloody stools * cognitive defecits from anoxic brain injury [**1-27**] respiratory arrest * h/o cerebral edema s/p VP shunt * h/o prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy * h/o dysphagia and aspiration PNA with G tube placement (now removed) * h/o seizures, on anticonvulsants * Ulcerative colitis * h/o dysphagia * h/o aspiration PNA * H/o UTIs * Psoriasis * h/o DVT in post-op period * Hypothyroidism, on Synthroid  Social History: Living at [**Hospital 32458**] rehab facility following anoxic brain injury in [**2161**].

CT head                           Date: [**2168-4-8**] 1.
CXR (confirm placement of PICC)   Date: [**2168-4-10**] Frontal view of the chest compared to multiple prior examinations.
Multiple EKG leads are present.
Severe enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles, similar to the prior CT five days ago with patent aqueduct of sylvius.
CMV, O&P, C.dif, stool studies were negative.
CT abd/pel showed signs of colitis on admission, but no abscess.
CXR was negative at OSH.
CNS infection was considered, but no change in MS per husband, no rashes, and no CT head findings to increase suspicion.
Colonoscopy on HD3 revealed pancolitis, as well as unclear foreign object that seemed to be embedded in the bowel wall.
Radiology was then contact[**Name (NI) **] to review the abdominal imaging with the foreign object in mind, and the team was notified that the patient's VP shunt perforated the bowel wall in the region of the transverse colon.
CSF studies were sent at that time, and revealed E. Coli.
The VP shunt was sent for culture and grew out Enterococcus, a species that was sensitive to vancomycin.
They recommended follow-up in 4 weeks with a non-contrast head CT prior to her next visit.
On [**4-18**], vancomycin trough was 36.7 on 1 gram [**Hospital1 **].
Vanco was held and level checked [**4-19**] am.
She continued to have frequent discharges on EEG and was started on Vimpat 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
Call the transplant center for help with dosing, keep trough levels 6 - 8, call for advice regarding dosing regimen CD with most recent MRI and Head CT has been sent with patient  Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the [**Hospital **] clinic at [**Hospital6 8432**] Center.
You will need to have a non-contrast head CT scan completed prior to your office visit at 10am at the [**Location (un) 591**] Radiology department at [**Hospital1 32464**].
