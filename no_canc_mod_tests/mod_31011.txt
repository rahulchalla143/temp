PA catheter secured in place for continued hemodynamic monitoring in the CCU.

On exam pitting edema appreciated to right and left knee, and lungs with crackles b/l.
Swan removed, PICC placed and plan is for patient to have Milrinone pump as an outpatient to provide better cardiac output.

Pt was initially on heparin gtt without problems, then switched to home regimen of Warfarin alone when INR > 2.
INR on discharge was 2.4.
Cardioversion considered and TEE done which, unfortunately, showed a left atrial thrombus so cardioversion was not pursued.

His kidney function improved and his Cr was 1.0 on discharge.
## TRANSITIONAL - Left Atrial Thrombus, continue Warfarin monitoring with goal INR [**1-13**] - Cont PICC Line Care and Milrinone monitoring - Lisinopril was held and not restarted during this admission due to [**Last Name (un) **] and softer [**Name (NI) 96683**] Pt needs to address with next provider whether to restart in order to optimize CHF regimen.
