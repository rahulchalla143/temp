Emergency medical services vital signs revealed blood pressure 90/palpable, heartrate 120s, oxygen saturation 90% on 1 to 2 liters (this was the patient's home oxygen level).
The patient's blood pressure decreased and he was started on intravenous fluids and Dopamine drip.
Computerized tomography scan of his head at the outside hospital was negative for an acute bleed.
The patient had a CTA at the outside hospital which was read as positive for segmental pulmonary embolism.
Laboratory studies at an outside hospital revealed white blood cell count 19, INR 11.
One set of cardiac enzymes were negative.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for further care including evaluation for an inferior vena cava filter.
Pulmonary artery atresia; 7.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications as an outpatient include - 1.
Vitamin C; 11.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed pulse 102, blood pressure 98/64, respiratory 24 on assist control.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pinpoint pupils, oral mucosa moist without lesions, elevated jugulovenous distension.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission revealed white blood cell count 23.3, polys 93, bands 0, lymphs 5, monos 2.
Hematocrit 36.5, platelets 264, sodium 142, potassium 4.0, chloride 104, bicarbonate 30, BUN 35, creatinine 1.0, anion gap 8.
Glucose 154, phosphorus 1.5, magnesium 1.8, calcium 8.8, INR 2.9, PTT 39.2.
Urinalysis, large blood, trace ketones, 12 to 50 red blood cells, no white blood cells or bacteria.
Chest x-ray:  Hyperinflated lungs, bilateral upper lobe opacities, flat diaphragm.
Pulmonary - The patient was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation for inferior vena cava filter placement for suspected pulmonary embolism in the setting of Coumadin taken for atrial flutter.
Repeat CTA showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Shock - Shock was felt likely due secondary to sepsis.
The patient received urine cultures, blood cultures and sputum cultures on admission and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Sputum cultures from [**2184-8-15**] grew gram negative rods.
The patient also had stool sent for Clostridium difficile which was negative.
Blood cultures from [**2184-8-11**] were negative and those from [**2184-8-15**] pending at the time of discharge.
Urine culture from [**2184-8-15**] were negative for growth.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were continued for a total of a seven day course at which time they were discontinued as the patient's white blood cell count began to normalize and the patient remained afebrile.
Following weaning of the pressors, the patient's blood pressure remained stable.
Cardiovascular - Given the patient's history of cardiomyopathy with prior inferior myocardial infarction, the patient had cardiac enzymes cycled.
Although creatinine kinases were elevated to a peak of 471, troponins were less than .01.
The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2184-8-12**] which showed an ejection fraction of 10 to 15% with a dilated left atrium, right atrium and left ventricle.
The patient's outpatient Bisoprolol was restarted and the patient was recycled for enzymes, all of which were negative.
When CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism, the patient was changed to Lovenox at deep vein thrombosis prophylactic doses.
The patient's hematocrit drifted down over the course of the Intensive Care Unit stay, although it eventually stabilized at 30.
INR levels will need to be monitored and the Coumadin doses adjusted as needed for  a goal INR of 2 to 3.
The patient will also require periodic hematocrit checks to ensure that it is not further drifting down.
Pulmonary artery atresia 3.
Septic shock 5.
