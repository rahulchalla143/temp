An EEG only showed PLEDS during this aphasia state.
In mid-[**Month (only) 116**] he was hospitalized with chest pain, underwent stress testing and subsequent cardiac catheterization with placement of an LAD stent.
He recently visited with his oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] on [**2136-5-10**] who performed torso CT which showed no evidence of systemic disease.
On the day of admission he was apparently visiting with his girlfriend at [**Name (NI) 44734**] and had at 4:30pm he said "make a right turn, make a right turn" as they were driving to dinner.
He was brought to [**Hospital 25143**] Hospital in Wolfeboro and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
His fiancee states that he has been extremely compliant with his meds.
Past Medical History: 1. metastatic melanoma as above c/b radiation necrosis of the right temporal lobe and seizures 2. hypertension 3.
CAD s/p LAD stent [**4-10**]   Social History: Social history: lives with girlfriend, she gives him all his medicines   Family History: family history of MI, no family history of melanoma  Physical Exam: On admission:  Examination: T 95.6 BP 150/100 HR 72 RR 16 98% 2l General: ill appearing in NAD, cushingoid face HEENT: MMM Lungs: CTA bilaterally CV: RRR Abd: soft, NT Ext: no pedal edema, no rashes, multiple ecchymoses.
Coordination: not tested  Reflexes: The deep tendon reflexes are all present, symmetric and normal.
A brief outline of his hospital course on neurology is as follows (also taken from Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 44735**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] note of [**2136-6-8**]):  [**5-21**]: dexamethasone increased for 2mg to 4mg [**Hospital1 **] for temporal lobe necrosis secondary to XRT therapy, lamictal dose increased, loaded with depakote  [**5-23**]: experienced some shaking, given phenobarbital, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges over right hemisphere (PLEDS) seen on EEG  [**Date range (1) 44736**]: repeat head CT with no change from [**5-21**], no hemorrhage.
He was unable to get MRI due to recent CAD stent.
Continuous EEG showed spikes and slow waves thus patient was intubated on [**5-25**] for versed coma ([**Date range (1) **]) for burst suppression.
Also, spiked to 101.2 and started on ceftriax/vanco/flagyl for presumed aspiration pna  [**5-28**]: Urine growing enterococcus and sputum showing signs of infection, all [**Last Name (un) 36**] to levaquin so antibiotics changed to levofloxacin/flagyl.
[**5-31**]: vancomycin was added to levofloxacin as pt still spiking and WBC 20K.
[**6-17**]: (unable to find [**Month (only) 16**] from [**2143-6-16**]) Per resident's note: missed doses of keppra (8pm [**6-16**], 8am [**6-17**]), lamictal (8pm [**6-16**], 8am [**6-17**]), depakote (10pm [**6-16**], 6am [**6-17**], 2pm [**6-17**]).
He got a total of 6mg ativan (2pm, 3pm and 8pm) and a load of depakote 2g.
EEG showed spike/slow wave which resolved after ativan.
Thereafter it showed persistent periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDS) over the right hemisphere predominantly, with some occasional generalization over the left hemisphere, not correlating with any clinical seizure activity.
His phenobarbital level was titrated to a level in the mid- to high-30s, and his EEG recordings did improve, with fewer PLEDS.
Again, all cultures remained negative and the question of phenobarbital drug fever was raised.
He defervesced on his own, and still remains afebrile.
[**Date range (1) 44739**]: He was extubated [**7-3**] and remained stable, requiring only 2l nasal cannula and occasional suctioning and chest PT.
MRI head done which shows no appreciable change from the last MRI obtained [**2136-3-8**], consistent with static radiation necrosis.
Albuterol-Ipratropium [**12-9**] PUFF IH Q6H and q4prn 4.
