The patient had no visceral or lower extremity ischemia, however, over the last two days the aneurysm has been seen to be enlarging on CT scan and there was some suggestion of blood in the left chest suggesting contained rupture.
She was noted to develop a right sided parietal hemmorrhage on [**2152-10-5**], and then developed a new left frontal lobe ischemic infarct which was visualized in CT scan on [**2152-10-10**].
