At the time of initial presentation, her heart rate was in the 30s with a blood pressure of 70/30.
After treatment, she returned to narrow complex atrial rhythm at a rate of 50.
Her blood pressure remained low.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
She is also status post catheterization with a stent to the left circumflex in [**2135**], and is status post catheterization in [**2140**] showing patent grafts.
Most recent cardiac catheterization in [**2143-3-28**] showed elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with prominent V-wave and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tracing, preserved cardiac output, left main coronary artery with a 95% hazy lesion extending into the proximal left circumflex.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25-30% which was recently decreased to 15%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature was 97.1?????
?, blood pressure 93/48, respirations 17, pulse 64, oxygen saturation 97% on 2 L nasal cannula.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.1, hematocrit 33.8, platelet count 258; INR 2.8; potassium 5.0, this potassium was obtained after treatment for a hemolyzed potassium of 7.9, creatinine 10.1, BUN 66, glucose 194, magnesium 2.7, calcium 9.2, sodium 135, CK 42, MB not applicable.
Electrocardiogram showed non-sinus atrial rhythm.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with bilateral effusions.
Dopamine was initially required to maintain a heart rate greater than 50 and to maintain an adequate blood pressure.
Manual blood pressure taken on the right arm is consistently about 20 points systolic higher than a blood pressure taken on the left and correlates better with clinical status.
It is recommended that in the future, the right arm be used for blood pressure readings.
It is unclear how much of this blood pressure support was necessary given that the story behind the blood pressure discrepancy had not yet been discovered, and the patient was likely in early sepsis, as described below.
After a couple of days of antibiotics and monitoring of her blood pressure in the right arm, the patient was able to be weaned off Dopamine without problem.
During this time, she spiked a temperature to 104??????
A respiratory source was suspected, as blood cultures remained negative, urine cultures remained negative, and one respiratory culture showed rare growth of ..................  She will be continued on renally dosed Levaquin through [**2143-5-18**], to complete a 10-day course.
On the day of discharge after holding her Coumadin for two out of the three previous nights, her INR was still 4.1.
Given that her blood pressure remained on the low side of normal throughout her hospitalization with a normal sterile fashion and rate, her Atenolol, Isosorbide Dinitrate and Losartan were not restarted.
She was advised not to restart her Elavil, Gabapentin, Meclizine, ................., Isosorbide Dinitrate, Atenolol or Losartan until authorized to do so by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and/or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4251**].
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is because her INR was 4.1 on the day of discharge.
