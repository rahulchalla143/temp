The patient was admitted to an outside hospital with tachycardia, acidosis, hypoxia and hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 70s and a pH of 7.26.
He had an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia, but no evidence of acute ischemia.
An echocardiogram at the outside hospital showed an ejection fraction of 40% with anterior hypokinesis and akinesis.
He had a CT Scan angiogram which was negative for a pulmonary embolus, but did have a right lung effusion and consolidation.
The patient did have a troponin leak, but EKG changes were not suspicious for ischemia.
The patient had a repeat echocardiogram here at [**Hospital1 346**] which revealed an ejection fraction of 25%.
He developed a new pneumonia and had sputum positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
His blood pressure persistently remained low after the multifactorial secondary to sepsis versus decreased albumin.
The patient was given Dopamine to help increase cardiac output and help increase his blood pressure, however he developed a second troponin leak and lateral ischemic changes so Dopamine was discontinued.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon transfer from the ICU to the Medical Floor included a temperature of 97.7 F, blood pressure 98/50, pulse of 80, respirations 22.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  He had moist mucous membranes.
Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Posterior lung sounds were not assessed.
LABORATORY:  On transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the Medical Floor included a white count of 3.9, hematocrit 29.0, platelets 300.
PT 13.1, PTT 74.4, INR 1.1.
Chemistry showed a sodium of 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarbonate 30, BUN 20, creatinine 0.9 and glucose of 134.
Calcium is 9.0, phosphorus 2.9 and magnesium of 2.0.
Urinalysis showed zero to two white blood cells, no bacteria, occasional yeast and 21 to 50 red blood cells.
Chest x-ray showed no interval changes.
Two thoracentesis revealed that this is transudative in nature and it was determined that continued thoracentesis would only result in reaccumulation of fluid.
We monitored his effusions via chest x-rays and oxygen saturations.
His oxygen requirement remained stable and chest x-ray revealed stability of his effusions.
The patient was not placed on a beta blocker or ACE inhibitor given that his blood pressure remained low in his hypoalbuminemic state.
PUMP:  Patient had ejection fractions of 25% after his troponin leak, however repeat echocardiogram was obtained which revealed an ejection fraction of 35 to 40% showing improvement in his overall systolic function.
He maintained his electrolytes with a potassium greater than 4 and magnesium greater than 2.
When the patient was transferred to the Medical Floor and procedures were essentially over, the patient was started on Coumadin, however his INR is not yet therapeutic at this time.
A repeat urine culture when the patient was on the Medical Floor revealed no growth on his urine culture.
It is likely as the patient regains his strength, he will need a reevaluation and will likely be able to be started on a normal diet.
This will be available for blood draws for his INR checks and PTT checks while he is on heparin and Coumadin.
The patient will also be a candidate for a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor when his pressure improves.
Note to rehab facility, the patient will need his heparin drip and Coumadin titrated to maintain INR between 2.0 and 3.0 for treatment of his right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Of note, the patient will also need his insulin adjusted as necessary depending on his oral intake.
