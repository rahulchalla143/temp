Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Chest CT [**2175-6-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
An MRI of the cervical spine showed a severe canal stenosis with cord impingement at L4-L5.
Immunosuppressant levels were checked and followed.
However, post operatively, ECG changes were indicative of MI.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and confirmed cardiac ischemia.
The ECG was back to baseline, but cardiac enzymes kept rising.
CK peak was 571 on [**6-1**].
Echo showed no new wall motion abnormalities.
DM1: His glucose levels were monitored and regulated carefully.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted as necessary.
