There cholangiopancreatography, which revealed a stricture in the bile duct at the bifurcation, and CT and MRI showed evidence of a mass at the porta.
Blood culture there grew out Klebsiella with pus in the common bile duct on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  In the Emergency Room temperature 100.6, heart rate 100, respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 97 on room air and blood pressure 116/60.
Lungs were clear to auscultation with decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm.
White blood cell count 22.7, hematocrit 35.7, platelets 353, 88% neutrophils, 5% bands, 2% lymphocytes, INR 1.4, PT 14.2, PTT 38, sodium 133, K 3.6, chloride 104, bicarb 21, BUN 7, creatinine 1.2, glucose 96, albumin 1.6, total protein 6.1, blood cultures from [**6-22**] grew 2 out of 2 bottles of Klebsiella sensitive to Gentamycin, Pip and Bactrim resistant to Ampicillin and Ticarcillin.
CT on [**6-23**] showed no ascites, question mass at the hilum.
MRI on the 14th showed a soft tissue porta tumor.
Additional laboratory studies on arrival revealed an ALT of 43, AST of 101, alkaline phosphatase 292, amylase 81, calcium, magnesium and phos were normal and chest x-ray showed no acute process.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was originally admitted to the Surgery Service where he underwent multiple studies and interventions.
He had his ascitic fluid tapped, which was positive for gram positive coccii in pairs, clusters and he grew Enterococcus from his bile drain and his adomen.
He developed hypotension and diminished urine output on the [****], which required transfer to the MICU.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on the 10th showed strictures and the bile duct at the level of the bifurcation.
On the 17th he had endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stents revised.
On the 21st the patient had a CT of the abdomen that had a percutaneous stent placed with a decompressed biliary tree.
On the 24th he had a liver biopsy and the ultrasound on the 24th revealed a small liver without focal masses, air in the bile duct without dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts.
He had a tube cholangiogram on the 23rd, which showed a left biliary drawn slightly withdrawn.
On the 29th he had another CT of the abdomen, which showed a percutaneous biliary drain in the right lobe of the liver with the distal tip within the duodenum, also wit a percutaneous drain in the left lobe of the liver with distal loop within the gallbladder, small ascites, colonic diverticula without diverticulitis and small pleural effusion.
Pathology and cytology were as follows, on pathology of the liver from the 24th showed moderate steatosis and mixed cell inflammation with marked portal sinusoidal without complete nodules of cirrhosis consistent with toxic metabolic disease.
His Swan revealed a low wedge of 9 and the patient was found to be intravascularly deplete.
Ultrasound showed little ascites that was not palpable.
A KUB showed enlarged transverse colon.
