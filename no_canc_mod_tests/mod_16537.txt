Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 5mm to 3mm on right and 5mm to 4mm on left.
In BLE, patient has full strength in hip flexors and quadriceps, uncooperative with extensor examination or motor exam of feet.
Pertinent Results: [**1-25**] CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD PRELIMINARY REPORT:  Provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18936**].
FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital CT scan does indicate that there has been relatively prominent interval increase in size of the left-sided posterior temporal extra-axial hemorrhage.
The suprasellar cistern, particularly when viewed on the CT angiographic sections, remains visible.
CT angiography was obtained.
Compared with the prior CT angiogram performed on [**2157-7-4**], there does not appear to be any overt interval change.
It was my impression at that time of the first study that there was a left-sided trigeminal artery present, which is a congenital carotid/basilar anastomosis accounting for the basilar artery discontinuity.
The CT angiogram does not appear to show definite sign of an aneurysm at this time.
[**1-25**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT  FINDINGS:  Patient underwent interval repeat left-sided craniotomy with new post-operative and subcutaneous pneumocephalus/emphysema.
There is new hydrocephalus involving the left ventricle predominantly within the occipital and temporal horns which are dilated.
[**1-26**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Preliminary Report FINDINGS:  Similar appearance of left subdural hematoma status post evacuation, although with decreased pneumocephalus.
His BP was kept less than 140 with frequent neurochecks.
He had a CTA which showed no source for for the blood.
Follow up CT showed slight improvement of left sided subdural and continued with right sided subdural.
CT scan on POD 1 showed no interval change in the subdural heamtomas from the post operative CT scan.
the patient was extubated on [**1-26**] and was able to maintain his oxygen saturations despite this.
His neurologic exam on the morning of [**1-27**] was worse than on admission.
On [**1-27**], a repeat Head Ct was performed which showed a left extraaxial fluid collection increased in size from 7mm to 9mm, increased mass effect on lateral ventricles, effacement of sulci and minimal increase in shift of midline structures.
The patient's neurologic exam deteriorated.
