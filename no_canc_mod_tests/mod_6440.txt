He was evaluated by the cardiology consult who recommended CCU Admission for trial of Ibutilide (given his low BP, BB and CCB were deemed inappropriate).
HOCM 2. s/p MVR for endocarditis [**2120-10-6**], Carbomedics bileaflet mitral valve 3.

CXR [**2126-6-15**]: no acute cardiopulm abn.

Received Ibutilide 1mg over 10 minutes, monitoring ECGs q1min for QT widening.
His BP was stable throughout.
It was thought that an ablation would be complicated by his MVR, and a mini-MAZE would be complicated by his previous thoracotomies.
# MVR: [**2-7**] endocarditis - Continued coumadin with goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
INR 3.5 at time of d/c.
# HOCM: The pt has had an outflow tract obstruction as per echo in '[**20**], however he has not had a repeat echo to evaluate since then.
Repeat TTE done, which demonstrated no resting or inducible gradient, EF>55%, and stable MVR.
