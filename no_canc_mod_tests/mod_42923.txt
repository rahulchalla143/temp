Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system with 3-vessel coronary disease.
A large OM1 branch had a 50-60% proximal stenosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated right- and  left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 16 mmHg, mean PCW 22 mmHg).
The patient entered the lab in complete heart block with an escape rate of 40 bpm.
The patient's heart block resolved and the pacing wire was was removed at the end of the case.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2152-12-29**], regional wall motion abnormality is new and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
His MI was inferior and appears to involve the RV.
His enzymes were cycled, and his CK peaked at 1443.
Pump issues: He had an echo which showed an EF=45-50%, with some akinetic areas.
Baseline LFTs and TFTs were obtained prior to amio.
He will need close follow-up of this NSVT to determine effectiveness of amiodarone.
He will have a Holter monitor for 24 hours in several weeks after his amio load is complete, and will then follow-up with EP to have this reevaluated and further treatment prescribed.
His Flomax and Detrol were also continued.
On discharge, he was maintaining adequate O2 sats off of O2 and his wheezing was absent most of the time.
Repeat PA/lateral reported that the "previously described hazy opacity overlying R hemithorax was now less apparent".
8.Follow-up: Needs to be seen for a follow-up CXR in about 1 month to evaluate his "hazy opacity" for changes.
