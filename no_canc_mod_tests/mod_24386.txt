----- Blood cultures from [**7-19**] are NEGATIVE and from [**7-21**], [**7-22**], [**7-23**], [**7-24**] are PENDING.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.
#) RUE Thrombophlebitis with MSSA positive blood culture Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28316**] fevers to 102 when leaving the MICU; infectious workup was negative including CXR, UA/Urine culture, negative blood cultures.
ID consult was obtained; TTE was an excellent quality study showing no vegetations.
#) ARF: creatinine 1.7 on admission, records from PCP?????
Cr did trend down during MICU stay and CK trended down as well.
He likely had mild rhabdomyolysis and by the time of discharge, his creatinine was 0.9.
You developed a superficial phlebitis (superficial venous clot) which we do not believe is currently infected, but you did have one positive blood culture so you will need 4 weeks of IV antibiotics.
