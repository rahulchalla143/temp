She presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] where CT c-spine showed multiple cervical fractures and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical workup.
She was admitted to neurosurgery and an MRI of the c-spine was obtained.
MRI imaging was performed and she was scheduled for surgery.
Pre-op eval showed UTI and cipro was started on [**5-16**].
Her vital signs remained stable on [**5-20**] while on the diltiazem drip and she moved all four extremtiies and was interactive via head nods.
On [**5-21**] the patient had CXR showing a potential pneumomediastinum.
She had a Chest CT as well as a bronchoscopy and BAL and no study could definitively find a source.
Her INR increased to 2.6 and she received vitamin K as well as started on TPN with Vitamin K due to the potential that her increased INR was from malnutrition.
A MRCP was performed which did not reveal any retained stones or cholelithiasis.
And further work up was held as her renal issues took precedence though there were no acute surgical issues and LFTs should be followed in the future.
