CXR showed atelectasis vs infiltrate on L side and CT chest w/o contrast without significant abnormality.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 **], initial VS: 96.8 85 188/110 18 99%.
After talking with radiology, decided to pursue MRI which showed stability of type B dissection with slight increase in size of thoracic aorta.
For management of HTN, patient received another dose of home blood pressure medications including amlodipine 10mg, HCTZ 50mg ([**12-2**] of home doses) and labetolol 600mg without significant effect.
Past Medical History: - chronic type B aortic dissection - poorly controlled HTN - chronic renal insufficiency, baseline Cr 2.5 -3 - Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis - group B streptococcal bactremia - eczema - childhood asthma - allergic rhinitis - rotator cuff injury - G6PD deficiency   Social History: currently employed as a bartender - tobacco: smokes [**12-2**] ppd - ETOH: [**1-3**] drinks/ week Denies illicit drugs   Family History: Mother w/ CAD in her forties as well as DM and HTN.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-7-1**] atrial ectopy is absent.
CHEST RADIOGRAPH [**2176-9-20**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Please note that the patient is to have an MRI to further evaluate his aorta.
MRI CHEST/ MEDIASTINUM W/O CONTRAST [**2176-9-20**]: IMPRESSION: Little overall change in the appearance of the known type A dissection with continued slight interval increase in size of the descending thoracic aorta.
RENAL DOPPLER U/S [**2176-9-21**]: IMPRESSION: Main renal arteries are patent bilaterally with appropriate waveforms.
MRI imaging was not suggestive of this and aneurysm remained stable.
Medications on Admission: - amlodipine 10mg daily - labetalol 800mg [**Hospital1 **] - pletal (patient d/c'd) - HCTZ 50mg daily - celexa 40mg daily - claritin 10mg daily - calcitriol 0.25mg TID - clonazepam 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] - spironolactone 50 mg Tablet daily - cholecalciferol 800mg daily - triamcinolone cream - clobetasol cream   Discharge Medications: 1. citalopram 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
You were given a continuous infusion of a medication to lower your blood pressure, which gradually improved.
You were restarted on your home blood pressure medications, which you had not been taking for some time.
You had an MRI and an ultrasound, which did not show any worsening of your aortic dissection.
As your blood pressures remained a bit high we increased your labetalol to 800 mg three time a day (from two times a day).
