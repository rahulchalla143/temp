He had been told by his orthopaedic surgeon that he had arthritis; however, the character of the pain changed over the past two weeks to include substernal pressure and pain with exertion which was relieved with rest.
He went to [**Hospital3 38285**] where electrocardiogram showed initially 1-mm ST elevations in II, II, and aVF and ST depressions in V1 through V3.
Subsequent electrocardiograms showed worsening ST elevations up to 2 mm to 3 mm inferiorly with reciprocal 3-mm to 4-mm ST depressions in V1 through V4.
His lung was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His heart examination had a normal first heart sound and second heart sound without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
He had no peripheral edema and 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram on admission to the Coronary Care Unit showed a sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute with a leftward axis.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission were remarkable for a creatine kinase of 2768 with a MB fraction of 158.
Laboratories from the outside hospital showed a MB of 7.9 and a troponin of 5.1.
Complete blood count and Chemistry-10 were all within normal limits.
Coagulations revealed PTT was 100.8.
The patient was initially given a test dose of esmolol at 50 mcg/kg per minute to control his heart rate which was elevated in the 90s.
He was also started on Integrilin that evening in preparation for a catheterization the next day.
His creatine kinases were cycled and showed that his peak creatine kinase was 2768; the value on admission.
Coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system.
Due to the possibility that his cough could have been induced by captopril which the patient had been started on, captopril was stopped, and he was changed to an angiotensin receptor blocker (Cozaar) on which he was to be discharged.
(b)  Pump:  The patient was started initially on captopril and titrated as his blood pressure allowed.
Because his blood pressures remained in the 80s to 90s systolic, he was continued on only 6.25 mg p.o.
