In the Emergency Department, he had tachycardia and hypertension with vital signs 88/63 with a pulse of 135.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the Medical Intensive Care Unit revealed mild gastritis and therefore Plavix was held.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.1.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Upon admission is temperature of 99.0 F.; with heart rate of 77 to 117, blood pressure of 98 to 130 over 29 to 51; respiratory rate of 12 to 17; saturation of 100% on room air.
Neck is supple with jugular venous pressure of 5 centimeters of water.
Pulmonary: clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  Upon admission potassium 4.1 with 79% neutrophils, hematocrit of 22.9, platelets 154.
Sodium 143, potassium 4.0, chloride 110, bicarbonate 19, BUN 50, creatinine 1.1, glucose 130.
INR 1.3, iron 19, TIBC 345, reticulocyte 3.0.
Urinalysis showed moderate leukocyte esterase with greater than 50 white blood cells, 15 red blood cells, few bacteria and 3 epithelial cells.
Urine cultures pending.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm of 92 with right bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray showed no cardiopulmonary changes.
STUDIES:  [**2144-5-21**] echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastritis:  The patient was given three units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately from 22.9 to 30.1.
His hematocrit was checked every eight hours and held steady around 30, however, when he ruled in for a myocardial infarction, he was given another unit of blood despite his hematocrit being only 29.8.
His hematocrit then bumped up completely to 33.5.
His hematocrit was then checked just once a day.
His non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin and Plavix were held until his ruled in for a myocardial infarction and that was safely restarted once his hematocrit had been holding steady.
Also, his hematocrit held steady a couple of days prior to discharge, at around 33.5 prior to discharge.
A serum Helicobacter pylori was sent but was still pending upon discharge.
Coronary artery disease with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction:  By the third day of admission, the patient started ruling in for a myocardial infarction with CKs peaking at 224 with CK MB at 11 and CK MB index of 4.9.
His troponin peaked at 11 but then trended downward to 4.5.
After the enzyme trended downward, cardiac enzymes were no longer checked.
Cardiology was consulted and it was felt that cardiac catheterization would not be an option for this patient.
twice a day, however, his heart rate then became quite slow in the low 50s, so his metoprolol was then decreased back down to 12.5 p.o.
An EKG was obtained showing that he still had normal sinus rhythm at 63 beats per minute with prolonged QTC now of 493 which is new.
The patient was sent for an echocardiogram given that he ruled in for myocardial infarction.
The echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of 30% with anterior septal left ventricular hypokinesis.
The tricuspid regurgitation and depressed left ventricular function is new since the echocardiogram in [**2144-5-21**].
