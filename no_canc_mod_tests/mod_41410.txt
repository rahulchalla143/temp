Cath: [**2163-7-30**] 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial blood pressure with a central aortic blood pressure of 132/73 mmHg.
Aspirin 81 mgs daily indefinitely, Clopidogrel 75 mgs for minimum 6 weeks.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
#STEMI: EKG at [**Hospital1 **] notable for ST elevations in AvF, III, and v5, v6 and had (+)trop which was concerning for LCx teritory STEMI.
She had TTE once day after cath which showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall with EF 50-55%.
She continued to have good oxygen saturation and stable from respiratory stanpoint.
# Hypertension: Her Blood pressure was well controlled on metoprolol.
Valsartan was added on day of discharge but BP [**Month (only) **] to 90/50 so was not prescribed on discharge.
Her hematocrit reamined stable.
