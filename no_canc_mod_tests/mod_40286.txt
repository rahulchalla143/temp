Admission Date:  [**2181-10-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-10-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-12-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: s/p fall down 8 steps   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: 83M with CAD (MI [**09**] years ago, CABG #1 30 years ago at [**Last Name (un) 1724**], CABG #2 20 years ago at [**Last Name (un) 1724**]), ICD/PCM who was in his usual state of health until [**10-6**] when he fell while carrying a door up some stairs.
He wastransferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where a Head CT showed SAH (massive SAH, bilat SDH.
Due to fever and concern for aspiration PNA, sputum cultures were sent, blood culture negative thus far.
Subsequent CT head showed no significant change.
Echo showed EF of 20-25% with LV thrombus calcified.
ABX was dc'd as sputum showed 2+GPCpc/2+GPR/sparse yeast and no fever.
Of note, CT Torso showed left upper lobe lung mass and subcarinal enlarged node is seen.
On transfer: VS at transfer: afebrile, 125/70, HR 90-100, RR 20-30, 90-100% on NC.
At the time of discharge the patient's neurologic exam was substantially improved.

CTA Head: Pre-lim read prior to recons: negative for aneurysm.
[**10-6**] CT head - 1.
Ct C-spine - No CT evidence for acute fracture or malalignment.
However, severe degenerative changes puts the patient at risk for cord contusion even with minor trauma  [**10-6**] CT C/A/P - 1.
Ultrasound could be performed non-urgently for further evaluation  [**10-6**] CT-Angiogram - 1.
Head CT has shown diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with small bilateral subdural hematomas.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates no definite aneurysm, vascular occlusion, or high-grade stenosis.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates vascular calcifications, but no evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion in the carotid or vertebral arteries.
Left upper lung mass, left mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and upper lung scarring are noted and correlation with the torso CT is recommended.
[**2181-10-8**] CT BRAIN FINDINGS: In comparison to [**2181-10-7**] examination, there has been no substantial change in the extent of the widespread multicompartmental hemorrhages.
IMPRESSION: Extensive multicompartmental, including subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage, as well as small amount of intraventricular blood, stable when compared to the study from [**2181-10-7**].
[**2181-10-9**] CXR Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung is probably largely pulmonary edema, since perihilar edema was already present in the left lung yesterday and has worsened.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 37564**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated after OSH imaging revealed SAH after fall down 8 stairs.
The patient was admitted initially by neurosurgery and subsequently transfered to medicine for further evaluation of multiple medical conditions.
Repeat CT imaging of his brain demonstrated persistent b/l sub dural hematoma's and worsening diffuse SAH.
His exam improved and he was able to be extubated without incident.
Pulmonary: Plain CXR imaging was suspicous for aspiration, thus sputum was sent which showed GP rods and cocci.
Final culture showed yeast and normal respiratory flora and the anitbiotics were discontinued.
He underwent CT toros to rule out additional injury.
Per IP, further workup would have required CT guided biopsy.
PET CT or further imaging may be indicated pending family wishes.
Cardiac: CT torso showed a also a calcified left ventricle with aneurysm and thrombus.
ECHO was done for further work up and EF was noted to be 20-25 % (baseline from OSH records).
Further evaluation of left ventricular thrombus would require TEE and based on families desires to avoid invasive procedures was not indicated at this time.
Left thyroid nodule: incompletely evaluated on CT torso.
CT Torso: Splenic, left renal and left upper quadrant complex hypodensities, concerning for metastases.
The underlying pathology of these hypodensities remains unclear though may be due to abdominal visceral or lung metasteses.
INR was elevated to 1.5 and Vitamin K was started on [**10-10**].
His renal failure resolved and his creatinine returned to his baseline of 1.3.
However, partial diabetes could not be excluded based on his urine osms in the mid400s.
He was treated with gentle hydration with D5W with care not to overload his heart given EF of 20-25%.
Electrolytes were monitored twice daily while the patient was hypernatremic.
You also had a cat scan of your body to assess for other injury.
Followup Instructions: None                                [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 734**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 735**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 799**]
