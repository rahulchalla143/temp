His headache continued and he became confused and EMS was called and he was brought to [**Hospital 6685**] Hospital.
There a CT was done and he was noted to have a R basal ganglia bleed with IVH/  He had an INR of 2.2 and he was given one unit of FFP and was transferred to [**Hospital6 6689**] for further eval.
Prior to the intubation he was seen by neurosurgery, the exam documented listed that he was irritable and disinhibited but alert and responsive.
Diuresis was attempted but had no effect on his oxygenation and he was intubated and sedated.
His first new ischemic lesion was seen on head CT on [**3-7**].
Since [**3-5**] follow up head CT have shown the development of new ischemic lesions (CT's are listed below).
TTE performed yesterday was unremarkable.
Sputum culture and UA/culture have also been negative.

CT head ([**2180-3-9**]) IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI cannot be obtained since the patient has a pacemaker.
Therefore, close followup with CT or CTA is recommended.
Since the patient has multiple areas of possible infarcts, a central source of embolization is suggested and further workup might be considered.
LENIS [**3-9**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
CTA head/neck ([**2180-3-10**]): HEAD CT: No significant change is seen.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY: CT angiography of the neck demonstrates vascular  calcification at both carotid bifurcations.
Head CT shows no significant change in intraventricular hemorrhage, right parietal hypodensity, and left parietal hypodensity at the convexity.
CT angiography of the neck shows 60% stenosis at the left carotid bifurcation involving the proximal internal carotid artery.
CTA chest ([**2180-3-10**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE [**2180-3-14**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is definitely seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CT Head without Contrast ([**2180-3-21**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Compared to the most recent prior CT from [**2180-3-13**], there has been slight increase of the vasogenic edema associated with a right MCA infarction and slight increase of the associated mass effect without significant midline shift.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2180-3-24**]): IMPRESSION: Compared to most recent prior exam from [**2180-3-21**], there is unchanged hemorrhagic conversion of a right MCA infarct, unchanged left frontoparietal infarct, and stable intraventricular hemorrhage.
EEG ([**2180-3-28**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to unsustained runs of rhythmic theta/delta activity with sharp features in the R>L central regions.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infections are common causes.

MRSA SCREENS: [**3-9**], [**3-13**], [**3-20**], [**3-27**] negative   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year-old man with a history including CAD, s/p CABG complicated by post-op a. fib for which coumadin was started, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and GI bleed secondary to a duodenal ulcer who initially presented to [**Hospital1 6685**] and [**Hospital3 **] Centers with headache and neck pain and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after he was found to have predominantely intraventricular hemorrhage (possibly caudate origin) and multiple ischemic strokes in the setting of anticoagulation reversal and medical cardioversion.
He has been followed by serial CT scans and was noted on [**3-7**] to have developed a new area of hypodensity concerning for an new infarct.
He had a CTV which was normal.
A TTE and TEE did not show any obvious thrombus but did identify a moderate PFO with a right to left shunt.
His exam was notable for a left field cut, otherwise intact cranial nerves, symmetric and non-focal motor exam, and bilateral upgoing toes.
NEUROLOGY: The patient's examination remained relatively stable following admisison.
While the study showed insignificant stenosis on the left, the internal jugular line placement precluded visualization of the right internal carotid artery.
He subsequently underwent CTA of the head and neck which showed 60% stenosis at the proximal left ICA.
A head CT was repeated [**3-10**] to ensure lesion stability.
The imaging demonstrated unchanged intraventricular blood and stable ventriculomegaly.
After a repeat CT on [**3-21**] was stable, Coumadin was started with an aspirin bridge.
Once the goal INR of 1.8-2.5 was achieved, the aspirin was discontinued.
The dose of coumadin at discharge was 5 mg by mouth daily; the INR was 2.3. .
Given persistently waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, an EEG was performed to evaluate for seizure activity.
He was found to have copious secretions, fever, leukocytosis, and underwent bronchoscopy which showed thick mucous plugging and positive gram positive cocci.
As his echocardiogram prior to transfer was suggestive of a right-to-left shunt, he underwent a CTA chest which was negative for pulmonary embolism.
Two bottles from blood cultures drawn [**3-15**] grew GPC in clusters, as well as from [**3-17**].
At the team's recommendation, an ultrasound was performed to evaluate the PPM pouch, and found to be negative.
A trans-esophageal echocardiogram was also done to determine the length of vancomycin treatment.
An echocardiogram here was a limited study but notable for normal ejection fraction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and no evidence of ASD or PFO (was notable on TEE but not TTE prior to transfer).
HEME: Throughout the hospitalization, the patient had stable anemia with HCT 26-29.
Hematocrit was monitored daily.
Urine studies supported a diagnosis of SIADH.
VASCULAR: Given the persistent fevers, the patient underwent lower extremity ultrasound which showed no evidence of thrombosis.

You were then transferred to the intensive care unit at the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.
When it was considered safe, anticoagulation was re-started to treat the atrial fibrillation with a goal INR of 1.8 to 2.5. .
