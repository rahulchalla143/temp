She was immediately placed IV antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl), wound cultures were went, and wet-to-dry dressings were started.
On HD 2, she was transfused 1 unit of PRBC for a decrease in her hct to 24.2.
On HD 3, she was transfused an additional 1 unit PRBC for a hct of 24.9.
She continued to have low grade temperatures and surveillance blood cultures were sent from both her PICC line and a peripheral site.
She continued to report diarrhea and C.Diff cultures were sent.
Her initial admission blood cultures grew multi-resistant pseudomonas and she was placed on tobramycin on HD 4.
With the continued low grade fevers and poitive blood cultures, a CT A/P was performed on HD 5, demonstrating a right groin fluid collection and a thrombus in the fem-fem bypass graft.
She complained of some shortness-of-breath and a chext xray was performed demonstrating persistent right pleural effusion and possible small left pleural effusion.
On HD 6, she underwent a PMIBI demonstrating LVEF of 17%.
On HD 7, surveillance blood cultures continued to be sent with blood cultures for HD 8 still positive for pseudomonas.
On POD 1, she was transfused 2 units PRBC for a hct of 26.5.
Her blood cultures remained negative beginning on HD 9.
