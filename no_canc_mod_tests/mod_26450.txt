CT head [**1-16**] Unchanged encephalomalacic changes from bilateral right MCA territory infarct.
KUB [**1-17**] FINDINGS: Suboptimal positioning, please note diaphragms and inferior pelvis and part of the right abdomen not included in the radiograph.
KUB Study Date of [**2113-1-20**] 4:34 PM IMPRESSION: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern.
KUB [**1-19**] Wet Read: SJBj [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2113-1-17**] 10:11 PM Dilated small bowel loop up to 5.5cm.
# SBO: Pt developed vomiting and aspiration symptoms on [**1-17**] and a KUB showed small bowel obstruction, most likely [**2-23**] to an adhesion.
Repeat KUB on [**1-21**] suggested resolution of the SBO and he tolerated his diet without any further obstructive symtptoms.
This admission, c-peptide levels, insulin, beta-hydroxybuturate, and proinsulin levels were sent off but were unfortunately nondiagnostic.
The timing of the tests did not capture a moment of true hypoglyemia (BG <40 or <60 with symptoms) and therefore could not rule out an endocrinopathy.
Upper extremity ultrasound showed clots in multiple RUE deep veins and the R IJ.
Felt to have AMS [**2-23**] metabolic derangement.
Not likely acute intracranial process as no changed on CT head w/o.
