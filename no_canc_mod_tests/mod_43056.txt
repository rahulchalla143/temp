In the [**Location (un) 620**] ED, she was A&OX3, BP 191/81, HR 96, O2 at 100% on NRB.
She then was transferred to cardiac cath at the [**Hospital1 18**], which showed total occlusion of the LCx; two DES were placed.
Upon arrival to the floor, vitals were HR 85, Sat 100% on 2L NC, RR 16, BP 176/81.

70% proximal diagonal LCx: Total occlusion mid vessel RCA: Proximal 60% diffuse and distal RCA into PDA 60% Intervention: Promus DESx2 placed into the LCx  ECHO [**9-6**]:The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the posterior and lateral walls, and mild hypokinesis of the inferior free wall.

Cath showed complete LCx occlusion which was stented with 2 DES.
# STEMI of LCx: Presented with typical chest pain, STE in the lateral leads with reciprocal changes in the inferior leads, as well as subsequent development of Q waves in the lateral leads in the setting of elevated cardiac enzymes, with troponins and CKMB of 0.66 and 58, respectively, on admission, peaking at 3.76 and 99, respectively, within 24 hours.
The patient underwent emergent catheterization and 2 Promus drug eluting stents were placed in the LCx, which was found to be 100% occluded.
The patient remained in sinus rhythm and hemodynamically stable post-catheterization and throughout the course of the admission; her cardiac exam remained stable; she also remained clinically euvolemic.
Echo [**9-6**] showed: LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the posterior and lateral walls, and mild hypokinesis of the inferior free wall.
# DM2: Glucose was controlled with an insulin sliding scale; the patient resumed oral diabetes medications upon discharge.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: [**12-8**] Tablet, Sublinguals Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain: Place under tongue for chest pain, can use three times for an episode of chest pain, call 911 immediately.
