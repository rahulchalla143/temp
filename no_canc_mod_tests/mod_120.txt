His admission blood cultures showed high grade bacteremia with pneumococcus (3/4 bottles positive).
He underwent a broncheoalveolar lavage, from which cultures have remained negative.
Once the blood culture data returned his coverage was initially narrowed to levaquin, but he had persistent low grade fevers and a worsening of his leukocytosis, so was again started on broader coverage with cefepime and vancomycin for a question of ventillator associated pneumonia.
Serial CXRs done on [**3-15**] and [**3-18**] showed improvement in the LUL opacity but development of a new LLL opacity and left sided pleural effusion.
On [**3-20**], a chest CT was done which revealed a significant left pleural effusion with LLL collapse.
Cultures were negative.
An induced sputum was also done (as the patient was not clearing his secretions) and grew sparce OP flora.
Repeat CT scan one week later showed marked resolution of LLL effusion.
Interventional pulmonary and pulmonary were consulted for re-evaluation, but neither bronchosopy or re-tapping of left sided pleural effusion were felt to be indicated.
It was felt that he should stay on Levofloxacin indefinitely until a repeat CT scan may be performed as an outpatient to document clearance of his infection.
EKG did not show changes consistent with ACS, and one set of cardiac enzymes was negative.
An EKG showed isolated TWI in V2 and another set of cardiac enzymes was flat.
CXR at that time showed only improving LUL opacity.
He underwent a cortisol stimulation test, which showed an AM cortisol of 17, but the level did not respond to cosyntropin.
Blood pressures improved and remained stable.
His HCT was generally in the low to mid 20s, and he was given a unit of PRBCs with an appropriate HCT bump.
A reticulocyte count revealed appropriate marrow production.
Iron studies were repeated during this admission and were consistent with an anemia of chronic disease, possibly secondary to his HIV.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] most recent CD4 count was 227 and viral load was 52,000 in [**11-10**].
HCV Similarly, treatment of his HCV has been deferred.
He was seen by [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1060**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1061**] while here, with plan to follow-up in clinic after his rehab stay to readdress any social needs or possible drug rehabilation program if needed.
