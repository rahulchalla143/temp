Past Medical History: - Alcoholic cirrhosis, s/p orthotopic Liver [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2109-6-6**], [**2109-6-23**] exploration for hematoma and fluid collection, last liver biopsy [**2111-12-18**] with no acute cellular rejection but nonspecific findings and marked iron deposition - H/o malnutrition on TFs - Prior ESLD c/b ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, grade II esophageal varices and portal gastropathy, candidal and bacterial (SBP) peritonitis Post-[**Month/Day/Year **] course has been complicated by diarrhea and malnutrition s/p extensive workup that has not found a cause.
- Recurrent UTIs: Most recent cultures ([**2110-5-7**]) grew pan sensitive kleb pnemonia and corynebacterium, but in the past has grown out resistant strains of pseudomonas sensitive only to meropenem, amikacin.
QTc was 499-536 despite holding meds and given daily magnesium and potassium.
- Anemia with baseline Hct 27-30 - Hydroureteroephrosis/Urinary retention: Seen by [**Month/Day (2) **] as outpatient.
Most recent OMR note: secondary to recurrent infections and that intermittent catheterization led to hydronephrosis.

IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2111-12-25**] 5:58 PM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-19**] through [**10-18**]: Widespread pulmonary opacification is more pronounced today than at anytime since [**9-19**].
In this case, a chest CT scan would be very helpful in determining which abnormalities are pleural, which are pulmonary, and whether there is bronchial obstruction warranting bronchoscopy.

Sputum culture from here likewise grew MDR pseudomonas.
Legionella and penumococcal urinary antigens were negative as was influenza DFA.
All blood cultures were negative.
Swallow evaluation was positive for gross aspiration.
He was on stool guaiac positive in the ICU but without evidence of gross bleeding.
His iron supplementation was stopped as liver biopsy from [**2111-12-18**] showed iron deposition in Kuppfer cells/macrophages and mild deposition in hepatocytes.
Hereditary hemochromatosis gene was checked and found to be negative.
Hematocrit at the time of discharge was 24.6.
# Orthotopic Liver [**Month/Day/Year 1326**]: Patient recently underwent U/S guided liver biopsy [**2111-12-18**] for elevated transaminases with nonspecific findings and marked iron deposition.
Sirolimus levels prior to discharge were consistently 5.8-6 with a level of 7.0 on the day of discharge.
As an outpatient his oxycontin should be transferred to an increased dose of the fentanyl patch or vice versa with dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency:  The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.1.
His creatinine on the day of discharge was 1.3. .
Calcium 500 + D 500 mg(1,250mg) -400 unit Tablet [**Month/Day/Year **]: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
