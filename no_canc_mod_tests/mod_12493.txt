CTA [**2163-2-19**]: No PE, although motion limits assessment of distal subsegmental vessels.
ECHO [**2163-2-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-9-29**], the right ventricle is mildly dilated/hypokinetic with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Nasal swab returned negative on hospital day #1 and tamiflu was discontinued.
CT chest was reviewed with hematology and consensus was that findings were chronic and not consistent with acute chest syndrome.
# Pulmonary artery hypertension: CT Chest and Echocardiogram both confirm PA hypertension.
A repeat Echocardiogram should be performed as an outpatient to evaluate for interval change after sickle cell crisis has resolved.
The small filling defect seen in the right posterior lower lobe subsegmental vessel would be too small of a PE to cause such profound pulmonary HTN.
