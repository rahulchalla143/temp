She was initially seen at OSH ED where she had CT head, C spine and chest which were all unremarkable.
She looked well but had asympomtatic hypotension with SBP in 60s-80s so received 6L [**Month/Year (2) 10899**] at OSH and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
MRI also performed which was limited but revealed prevertebral edema C2-C6.
Neuro exam normal except for mild weakness triceps B/L.
She received an additional 2L NS with improvement in SBP to 90s-100s.
VS prior to transfer 71 112/60  17 98-99%2L .
Drinks wine with dinner, smokes ~ [**1-14**] ppd x >30 years.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2131-2-13**]):       REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10900**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10901**] @ 9PM [**2131-2-13**].
Wet Read: IPf TUE [**2131-2-13**] 2:58 AM Very limited scan due to motion; patient unable to cooperate.
Final Report CERVICAL SPINE MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [**2131-2-13**]  INDICATION: 52-year-old woman with fever and neck pain for four days.
Seen at an outside hospital with a negative lumbar puncture and negative CTs of the head and cervical spine.
COMPARISON: Cervical spine CT obtained at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2131-2-12**] is available for correlation.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and STIR images of the cervical spine were obtained, with axial gradient echo and T2-weighted images.
Following intravenous gadolinium administration, sagittal and axial T1-weighted images of the cervical spine were obtained.
There is also a small left posterior epidural rim-enhancing fluid collection at C7-T1 (series 13, image 6, and series 14, image 27) consistent with an abscess, which also moderately narrows the spinal canal and deforms the left posterolateral spinal cord.
Evaluation of spinal cord signal is limited due to motion artifacts.
Evaluation of cord signal is limited by extensive motion artifacts.
Radiology Report MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W& W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2131-2-14**] 1:14 PM   WHITE,[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] TSICU [**2131-2-14**] 1:14 PM MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W& W/O CONTRAST; MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W &W/O CONTRAST; MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 10904**] Reason: epidural abscess Contrast: MAGNEVIST Amt: 16    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    52 year old woman with epidural abscess REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    epidural abscess CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:    None.
Moderate-sized intracanalicular, epidural collection, which is intermediate in signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted imaging, and shows peripheral enhancement with central low signal on T1-weighted post-contrast images, results in moderate canal narrowing and in this setting is concerning for infectious phlegmon/early abscess.
COMPARISON: MR performed [**2131-2-13**].
TECHNIQUE: Multisequence multiplanar MR images were acquired of the entire spine, before and after the administration of contrast.
The cervical spinal cord and the cranio-cervical junction are unremarkable in appearance.
THORACOLUMBAR SPINE: The visualized spinal cord and conus medullaris are normal in appearance and terminate normally at the L1 vertebral body level.
MRI was concerning for cervical epidural abscess and the patient was taken to the OR for anterior C5-6 corpectomy / cage / fusion on [**2131-2-13**] and C6-T1 lami / C4-T2 PSF with ICBG on [**2131-2-14**] without complication.
An echo performed [**2131-2-15**] revealed no evidence of vegetation.
Please call the office if you have a fever>101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, drainage from your wound, or have any questions.
