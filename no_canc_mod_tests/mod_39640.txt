CT Chest [**1-26**]: IMPRESSION:  1.
Short-term followup CT after treatment for infection is recommended.
Renal U/S RENAL ULTRASOUND: Study is limited due to patient's body habitus and difficulty complying with instructions.
Echogenic kidneys, suggestive of underlying renal parenchymal disease.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
EKG [**1-31**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-1-25**] the rate is increased.
[**2130-3-2**] CT C/A/P: 1.
Left pericolic gutter fluid collection, likely due to recent extensive spinal surgery, however, superinfection of this collection cannot be excluded.
Radiopaque gallstones without CT evidence of cholecystitis.
Small right perinephric fluid collection is noted as seen on the CT study of one day prior.
Left retroperitoneal fluid collection, better defined on the [**2130-3-2**] torso CT. 4.
Contrast-enhanced images may be performed for assessment for intradural infection, if clinically indicated.
[**2130-3-10**] TEE: No echo evidence of endocarditis.
o/w study unchaned when compared with above TTE.
The biopsy showed significant nephron hypertrophy, a finding associated with obesity.
Electron microscopy showed global foot process effacement which further supports a primary process.
Her urine Pr:Cr improved to 1.1 on [**2130-3-12**] from 2.8 on [**2-28**] and 1.8 on [**3-6**].
Her cholesterol was found to be elevated while her triglycerides were normal and she was started on a statin.
Weekly urine Pr:Cr levels and serum albumin should be checked (next [**2130-3-20**]) and results faxed to nephrology.
She should follow up with nephrology as scheduled and results of her weekly urine protein:creatinine  and serum albumin should be faxed to Dr.[**Name (NI) 433**] office.
Although positive for cholelithiasis, RUQ U/S was negative for cholecystitis.
There was also some concern for abscess given recent surgery with abdominal approach and CT abdomen/pelvis showed no definitive abscess or evidence of such.
Despite no clear intraabdominal process causing leukocytosis, blood and urine cultures were positive for VRE on [**3-3**] as discussed below.
Her white blood cell count and differential should be monitored at rehab given her multiple sources of infection and treatment with linezolid.
# VRE bacteremia:  Blood and urine cultures from [**2130-3-3**] were positive for VRE.
Her PICC line was pulled and her foley changed and subsequent cultures have been negative.
Although her total WBC count normalized, she developed a bandemia of 13% which resolved after being taken to the OR for surgical wound debridement; surgical wound also grew VRE and MRSA.
Daily CBCs must be monitored while she is on linezolid and it should be discontinued on [**3-24**] with close monitoring following its discontinuation.
Ortho spine feels that these deficits may not improve significantly given similar pre-and post-op function.
Cultures were sent which revealed VRE and MRSA.
# Elevated INR:  INR became elevated to 1.4.
This was thought secondary to volume overload and CT chest demonstrated diffuse interstitial disease that could be [**2-10**] heart failure, but TTE revealed normal function.
# Osteoporosis: Most likely related to vitamin D deficiency with low vitamin 25 hydroxy D.  She has a history of several vertebral compression fractures, present since [**2116**].
She did develop a hematoma s/p renal biopsy that subsequently remained stable.
