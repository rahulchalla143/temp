The neurology service was consulted, and and MRI showed likely old small lacunar strokes, but no acute changes.
Blood pressure in the emergency department was 226/87.
Chest x-ray was suspicious for a dilated thoracic aorta.
Chest CTA revealed a 6.6 cm aortic aneurysm of the descending aorta at the level of T10, and a smaller 4.6 cm focal aneurysmal dilation just below this area.
She was admitted for further evaluation and management.

Strength 5/5 in all extremities, equal without pain with passive or active movement on lower extremities bilaterally   Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2115-3-9**] No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect is identified.
CTA Chest [**2115-3-11**]  6.6 cm focal lesion in the azygoesophageal recess abutting the aorta.
CTA chest [**2115-3-12**] 4.9 cm fusiform aneurysm of the infrarenal aorta.
Followup CT of the chest in three months should be performed to ensure stability.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallow [**2115-3-13**] No evidence of aspiration.
MRI [**2115-3-14**]  2.8 x 3.3 x 3.9 cm right paraaortic mass with features most likely represents a thrombosed pseudoaneurysm or thrombosed saccular aneurysm.
TEE could be performed for further evaluation to determine whether duplication cyst may be present.

Remaining exam unchanged.
[**2115-3-14**] Endoscopy Results: Erosive gastritis Duodenitis in the bulb Extrinsic compression in the esophagus  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 8320**] was admitted for further evaluation and management for mental status changes and hypertension and was found to have a large thoracic/descending aortic aneurysm.
She underwent multiple chest CT scans as well as an MRI to characterize her thoracic/descending aortic aneurysm (please see results section for reports).
These were compared with MMS reconstruction images of MRI images from an outside institution.
Carotid ultrasound was done on [**2115-3-12**] and showed non-hemodynamically significant stenosis of less than 40% was demonstrated in the right internal carotid artery with hemodynamically significant stenosis of 40-59% demonstrated in the left internal carotid artery.
As part of her pre-operative work-up, the GI service was consulted for long-standing dysphagia.
Oropharyngeal swallowing evaluation showed no evidence of aspiration.
Her esophagram was normal.
EGD showed erosive gastritis, duodenitis in the bulb with extrinsic compression in the esophagus.
After pre-operative workup was completed, the patient was taken to the operating room for endovascular repair of her thoracic aortic aneurysm on [**2115-3-20**] (please see the detailed operative note of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).
She required a nitroglycerin drip for 2 days for blood pressure control and this was eventually weaned off.
She received 1 unit of blood on post-op day 2 and her lumbar drain was removed.
Repeat imaging revealed a stable (not actively bleeding) left lower quadrant retroperitoneal hematoma.
MRI imaging revealed some lumbar cord edema but no epidural hematoma.
She required a nitroglycerin drip for blood pressure control which was weaned off and she was transferred back to the floor on post-operative day 7.
Oral antihypertensives were optimized for blood pressure control.
We have started you on a new medication to help control your blood pressure.
Please make an appointment with your primary care physician within one week of discharge to follow-up on further testing and establishing a neurologist.
