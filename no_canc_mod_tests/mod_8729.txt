She was found to have a thoracoabdominal aneurysm during an echocardiogram in [**2125-8-12**] after which he subsequently underwent an aortogram which noted a markedly dilated tortuous thoracic aorta with a normal distal suprarenal aorta with patent renal vessels and bilateral iliac disease.
She underwent reimplantation of her mesenteric and left renal arteries during this surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the Intensive Care Unit, vital signs with heart rate of 96, blood pressure 123/71 with 100% on ventilation with an SIMV of 800/14.
She had a chest tube that was on wall suction.
Her pulses were palpable bilaterally of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial.
Her laboratory values on white count were white count of 10.9, hematocrit of 41.4 and platelets of 86.
Panel-7 showed sodium of 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 105, bicarbonate 18, BUN 23, creatinine 1.2, blood glucose 202.
Her PT was 17.9 with an INR of 1.9 and her PTT was 61.9.

She had a chest x-ray that was done that showed the chest tube at the apex of the lung with minimal pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
She self extubated on [**11-4**] and was reintubated on [**11-6**] for decreasing saturation with increasing work-up of breathing.
Coumadin to keep the INR between [**3-18**].
Her INR had been appropriate at Coumadin dose of 2.5 mg but had been elevated recently so the Coumadin has been held.
She is on Lopressor 2.5 mg/NG tube but this has full parameters for a systolic blood pressure less than 110 and heart rate less than 60.
She will require tracheostomy care with chest PT and suctioning as needed.
