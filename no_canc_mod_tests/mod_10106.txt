He was taken to the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital Emergency Room where a CT of the spine was concerning for a C2 fracture and he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for stabilization.
Further examination showed no evidence of C2 fracture.
While awaiting further evaluation Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**] had a rapid heart rate with a supraventricular rhythm and cardiology was consulted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 35.6.
Blood pressure 139 to 164/69 to 87.
Heart rate 80s.
Deep tendon reflexes are nil in the left upper extremity, 2+ in the right upper extremity, 2+ at the knees and 1+ at the ankles.
STUDIES:  CT of the head with C spine revealing no fracture and the parenchyma is grossly intact.
MR imaging reveals a few small and bilateral diffusion slowing in the frontal, parietal and occipital areas consistent with infarction.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 7.9, hematocrit 39, platelets 282, PT 12.9, INR 1.1, PTT 29.7, sodium 136, potassium 3.6, chloride 101, bicarb 22, BUN 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose 301, calcium 9.5, magnesium 1.7, phosphate 3.2, AST 46, ALT 58, alkaline phosphatase 218.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**] was subsequently transferred from the Trauma Service to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit after evaluation revealed no evidence of C2 fracture.
However, subsequent evaluation of the electrocardiogram reveals that he had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia, which converted to normal sinus rhythm with the addition of Amiodarone.
Evaluation for his strokes revealed multiple infarctions as noted above consistent with a water shed distribution infarction perhaps in the setting of a rapid ventricular rate.
Evaluation of his carotid arteries with ultrasound revealed no evidence of significant disease in the cervical potions of the bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries.
MR of the cervical spine shows no soft tissue disease and no evidence of fracture.
A hemoglobin A1C revealed that he had a level of 13 suggesting underlying diabetes mellitus.
