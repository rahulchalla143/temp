[**12-29**] CXR AP port: FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "upright with grid" is compared with the study obtained some two hours earlier.
The lung volumes remain low and (allowing for technical differences) the patchy airspace process involving the right mid lung and both lung bases has become more confluent.
[**12-30**] CXR AP port: Rapid progression of right lung consolidation involving right lower lobe/anterior right upper lobe.
[**12-31**] CXR PA/LAT: Widespread, multifocal areas of consolidation have progressed in the interval, particularly in the mid and lower lungs bilaterally.
[**1-1**] CXR PA/LAT: In comparison to the previous radiograph from [**2200-12-31**], there is further progression of bilateral parenchymal consolidations.
# Multifocal pneumonia:  Initially, due to concern for respiratory distress and fever, Pt was assessed by CT scan for pharyngeal abscess, which was negative.
His initial CXR, however, showed a multifocal pneumonia by CXR.
GAHS throat swab was negative as was urine legionella, GC, and Chlamydia.
