Compared to the previous tracing of [**2182-10-8**] ST-T wave changes are more marked.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2182-11-12**] ST-T wave changes are slightly less.
The patient was given two units of pRBCs, and her Hct increased appropriately and stayed relatively stable.
EKG upon admission demonstrated ST depressions and TWI suggestive of ischemia.
Pt received two units of blood in the MICU, and Hct increased from 22 --> 26.
Hct stable throughout remainder of hospitalization from 26-28.
Given, however, poor study for last capsule endoscopy, may be reasonable to attempt another capsule study to attempt to localize a bleeding lesion (for targeted intervention thereafter) as an outpatient.
Patient had ischemic changes on EKG in the ED and mild troponin leak.
Troponin peaked at 0.06.
Considering patient's dropping hematocrit, it was not appropriate clinically to anticoagulate this patient.
We kept the patient on ASA and statin, and replenished blood volume with 2 units of pRBCs in the MICU.
Per cardiology, goal Hct = 25. .
He advised a goal Hct would be approximately 25 for Ms. [**Known lastname **].
Considering the patient has multiple terminal illnesses (slow GI bleed refractory to therapy; triple vessel CAD with MR 4+; severe systolic heart failure, cirrhosis), we initiated a palliative care consult to begin discussing what the patient's specific goals of her care are.

Patient should have CBC drawn twice per week and sent to PCP.

)(s)* Refills:*0* 17. lisinopril 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Consider transfusing to a goal Hct of 25.
You were given two units of blood while you were here, and your blood count rose, and remained stable.
They recommended a video capsule study to evaluate for any occult or gross bleeding source.
It was thought that your hematocrit drop (blood count) is not from a brisk bleed in your GI tract (based upon prior endoscopies), but most likely a slow bleed that may not be amenable to repair (which may be secondary to your liver disease).
You will need to have your blood count checked twice per week as an outpatient (prescription attached) and faxed to your primary care doctor.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
The gastroenterologists may wish to have you do a capsule endoscopy study in approximately one week.
Finally, you met with our palliative care team, in regards to your chronic, terminal conditions, which may not be amenable to interventions.
