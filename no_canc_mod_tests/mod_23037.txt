MRI from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital, [**2173-9-29**]: LUMBAR SPINE: L1-L2: There is a focal left paracentral disc protrusion and a broad based right paracentral to extraforaminal disc protrusion, with associated spondylitic ridging.
MRI HEAD: Results are unavailable   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year-old woman with a past medical history including obesity, DMII, hyperlipidemia, and cervical spondylosis who was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**2173-10-7**] with with lower extremity weakness and was found to have stenosis at L1-2 for which she underwent laminectomy; she subsequently developed progressive weakness in the lower extremities, upper extremities, and face and was discovered to have evidence of AIDP.
# NEURO: When the patient first presented, she was evaluated by both Neurosurgery and Neurology, where she was found to have diffuse weakness, R>L, a R sided facial palsy, decreased pinprick to the mid thighs, saddle anesthesia, brisk reflexes in the upper extremities, but no reflexes in her lower extremities.
It was suspected that her inability to walk was due to her lumbar stenosis, and that her facial and upper extremity weakness were due to a lacunar stroke, that was too small to pick up on MRI.
She had a repeat MRI with DWI to rule out possible infarction to explain her symptoms, which was negative for infarct.
During surgery on [**10-12**], a CSF sample was obtained, which showed an elevated protein of 197, with 1 WBC and 24 RBCs.
An EMG was consistent with the concern for [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **].
Sputum culture demonstrated gram positive cocci in clusters for which IV vancomycin was begun ([**2173-10-28**]) and subsequently switched to nafcillin after it was determined to be coagualase positive staph sensitive to nafcillin.
Stool was positive for c. difficile toxin for which flagyl was started ([**2173-10-29**]).
A follow-up EGD demonstrated a clear esophagus, suggesting the concretions had spontaneously passed.
After transfer to the neurology floor, speech and swallow study was attempted but tracheostomy size was too large.

Neurologic exam notable for paraparesis with limited movement at proximal legs and none distally; moderate weakness of UEs but at least antigravity.
