His NIHSS at OSH was 22 and initial head CT had hyperdense MCA sign.
He had an MRI, which showed watershed strokes between the ACA/MCA and MCA/ACA/PCA on the left hemisphere.
Regarding his lab work, his troponin was negative; HbA1c is 5.5 and lipids are: total chol 101, trigs 48, LDL 45 and HDL 46.
His INR should be checked daily for the first few days after discharge to see when his levels become therapeutic.
While in the hospital, you had an MRI of your head as well as studies to help identify the cause of the stroke, including an Echocardiogram of your heart.
