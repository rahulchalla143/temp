Discharge Instructions: You have been admitted to the hospital for evaluation and treatment of a myocardial infarction (or heart attack).
You underwent a cardiac catheterization that showed there to be a blockage in one of the major vessels supplying blood to your heart.
Because of these findings you will need to take coumadin (a blood thinner) for 3 to 6 months and see an electrophysiologist in one month's time for evaluation of a possible cardiac defibrillator.
Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 285**] Date/Time:[**2160-12-16**] 1:00pm for evaluation of possible defibrillator placement.
Please call your Primary Doctor and arrange follow-up to have your INR checked once this week, and once early next week.
