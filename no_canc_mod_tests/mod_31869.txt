Cardiac catheterization with left main coronary artery bare metal stent placement  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 79-year-old male with history of prior CVA, hypertension, cirrhosis and prior NSTEMI which was treated medically in [**2136-10-24**] who presents now as a transfer from OSH with a new NSTEMI.
The patient presented to OSH and was found to have elevated Troponins to 2.0 with CK of 103.
CXR showing mild pulmonary edema.
The patient was treated as an NSTEMI protocol with heparin, [**Doctor Last Name **], [**Doctor Last Name 4532**] load and he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Aditional review of his EKG at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed normal sinus rhythm but prominent ST segment depressions in I, II, aVL, V5-V6 and ST segment elevations in leads aVR and V1.
In the cardiac cath lab, a right heart catheterization demonstrated RA Pressure of 19 mmHg,RVEDP 21 mm Hg, PASP 51 with a mean of 39 mm Hg and PCWP 34 mm Hg.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left-sided filling pressures consistent with cardiogenic shock.
The cardiac output was 4.2 l/min with an index of 2.0 l/min/m2 and left ventriculography was deferred with plan to stabilize patient with IABP and consider stent or  CABG at later time.
Physical Exam: VS - afebrile, T 98.4, IABP Augmented Diastolic BP 105/50, HR 82, SaO2 95% 4L NC, RR 20 Gen: No acute distress, well-developed and well-appearing middle aged male.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
CTA anteriorly, decreased b/s at bases.
Ext: Slightly cool lower extemities with 1+ pedal pulses bilaterally, no edema.
[**2136-11-2**] Cardiac Cath Report: 1.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and a 30% residual stenosis at the trifurcation site.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:PTCA and placement of a bare-metal stent in the distal LMCA to origin LAD.
[**2136-11-3**] ECHO : The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
pMIBI at OSH [**1-/2136**]: left ventricular dialtion with diffuse hypokinesis and reduced EF to 35%.

:  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE/NSTEMI and CARDIOGENIC SHOCK: The patient presented to OSH and was found to have elevated Troponins to 2.0 with CK of 103.
The patient was treated as an NSTEMI protocol with heparin, [**Year (4 digits) **], [**Year (4 digits) 4532**] load and he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Aditional review of his EKG at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed normal sinus rhythm but prominent ST segment depressions in I, II, aVL, V5-V6 and ST segment elevations in leads aVR and V1.
CK peaked peaked at 400.
Admission TTE/ECHO [**2136-11-1**] showed moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %) and Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The patient was initially placed on IABP 1:1 and gentle diuresis was given with lasix.
Diagnostic coronary angiography showed 2 vessel and left main coronary artery disease as patient was found to have 90% L-main occlusion.
PUMP FUNCTION: ECHO revealed LVEF of 35%.
He received post catheterization diuresis with Lasix and his CXRs showed improvement in his pulmonary edema throughout his hospital course.
The patient's oxygen saturations were improved to 96 % on room air by time of discharge and he had no clinical complaints of shortness of breath and only trace lower extremity edema which had improved from his initial presentation.
ANTICOAGULATION: The patient's most recent ECHO revealed moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =35-40 %)and the right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
His Cr peaked at 2.4 and came down to 1.6/1.7 by time of discharge.
He had no appreciable RUQ tenderness, jaundice, HSM on exam and he will plan to follow-up with his usual PCP after discharge regarding his GI management.
Hepatitis B/C panels were done and were all negative.
He had no dullness to percusssion on exam and he had no significant cough or productive sputum during his CCU course.
At time of discharge he had WBC count of 8.1 and was afebrile.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION: On [**2136-11-5**] the patient had a routine UA which revealed bacteria and WBCs and labs were consistent with a UTI so he was started on Doxycycline for a 7 day regimen.
Follow-up urine cultures were negative.
FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES: The patients magnesium and potassium were repleted on an as needed basis during his hospital stay and daily electrolytes were monitored.
Continue doxycycline for 3 remaining days of therapy for a urinary tract infection and continue daily Warfarin as prescribed to avoid blood clots and to decrease stroke risk.
