[**2126-9-19**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-5-31**], the effusion is larger.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade maybe absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
The mitral and tricuspid inflows are difficult to assess in the presence of atrial fibrillation  [**2126-9-19**] Abdominal US Scans of the four quadrants of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a large volume of ascites, which represents a distinct change from previous ultrasound scan of [**2125-10-4**] which showed no ascites.
[**2126-9-20**] Cardiac Catheterization COMMENTS: 1.
Hemodynamic assessment revealed severely elevated pulmonary arterial systolic pressures, with PASP 91 mmHg at baseline.
Cardiac index is preserved at 2.3 L/min/m2 but reduced compared to prior RHC.
Plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (notified) and CCU team (notified)  [**2126-9-25**] CT chest w/o contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 64 yo female with severe pulmonary hypertension (multiple etiology- CREST, diastolic heart failure), chronic atrial fibrillation, emphysema, diastolic heart failure, and large ventral abdominal hernia presents with exertional dyspnea.
She was taken to cardiac catheterization and was found to have elevated pressures in the right and left heart with equalization of diastolic pressures.
Her dyspnea continued, and it was felt that this was partly due to her large volume ascites.
The patient's ascites was likely due to right sided heart failure, mostly with a diastolic component but also worsened by her severe pulmonary hypertension.
After her paracentesis, her symptoms improved as above.
# Atrial fibrillation - The patient's rate was well-controlled on her digoxin dose.
At dishcarge, her INR was 2.0. .
An outpatient xylose breath test and small bowel followthrough will be scheduled by the GI service when she attends [**Hospital **] clinic.
Her diarrhea was at baseline at discharge.
At discharge, a hospice discussion was done with the patient, but further discussions will be made as an outpatient.
