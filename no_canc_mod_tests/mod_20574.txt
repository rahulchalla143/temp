CT Head was negative for overt stroke.
Over the next 24 hours his somnolence increased and his hct was noted to have dropped from 32.7 --> 27.5.
He began having melena and his hct continued to drop.
He was started on IV PPI and Octreotide and his hct stabilized at approximately Hct 25-26.
An EGD was performed and showed severe portal gastropathy with active oozing.
24 hours later a repeat EGD showed improvement in the bleeding but continued severe portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Of note, urine cultures eventually returned negative and his antibiotics were stopped.
The plan was to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his severe portal gastropathy and for further assessment.

No discrete focal lesions are seen; however, evaluation is markedly limited in the presence of fatty infiltration/coarsened echotexture.
[**2137-2-13**] HEAD CT This study is limited by motion artifact.
Post-surgical changes and mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinuses  [**2137-2-21**] HEAD / NECK CTA The CT angiography of the head demonstrates bilateral normal flow within the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
No acute abnormalities on head CT or change since the previous study.
[**2137-2-24**] EEG This is an abnormal 24-hour video EEG telemetry in the waking and sleeping states due to the electrographic seizures noted with rhythmic [**2-17**] Hz blunted sharp and slow wave discharges seen particularly over the bilateral parasagittal regions with occasional extension into the left temporal lobe.
He had an upper endoscopy this admission which confirmed no esophageal varices, and noted portal hypertensive gastropathy but no GAVE.
He was started on iron supplementation 325mg PO TID after his iron studies showed that he was iron deficient.
He was loaded on keppra given his hepatic disease, and transferred to the intensive care unit for further EEG monitoring.
This initial monitoring revealed no epileptiform activity, only nonspecific slowing.
Head CT at this time was unrevealing for any mass lesions or old infarctions.
MRI was deferred because the patient had clips that were not confirmed to be MRI compatable following sinus surgery.
His weight/body habitus was borderline for scanner limits.
Neurology saw the patient, and recommended a stat head CTA be performed to rule out vertebrobasilar insufficiency, which was normal.
RPR was checked and was negative.
EEG at this time did show epileptiform activity.
He was loaded on dilantin and free dilantin levels were checked, aiming at the lowest dose that prevented seizures given possible hepatotoxity.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION/CYSTITIS The patient developed a UTI while foley catheter was in place.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).
You had an upper endoscopy which showed a slow bleed from the high pressures in the veins around your stomach.
You may periodically need blood transfusions.
