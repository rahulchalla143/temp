Return to the operating room for control of bleeding  History of Present Illness: :85F with significant CAD and s/p CABG in [**2148**] hx of diastolic heart failure presents from OSH for cardiac catheterization for planned stenting of LM to LCx.
Pt was out of the room at 5pm and between 7 and 9 pm patient was hypotensive to systolic of 70-80 and dropped her HCT to 19 from a pre-op HCT of 30.
These issues prompted a CT scan which revealed a large left-sided RP hematoma.

Stenting of LM and LCX with Xience 4x28mm stent posted to 4.5 mm in left main ostium.
She remained with borderline BP for several hours and a repeat HCT went from 26 to 19.
A CT scan confirmed retroperitoneal bleed and she was transferred to CCU for transfusion and monitoring.
Hct remianed 20 despite total of 8 units of blood transfused over approximately 4-6 hours.
She had a noncontrast CT after 2 units that showed the beginnings of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
In the OR she had a relatively small RP hematoma and after underway her 1st intraop Hct came back at 35 (despite no further transfusions).
We controlled some minor venous bleeding points and closed with the supposition that based on now stable hemodynamics, Hct of >35 that there was no ongoing source and that the 2nd Hct was likely in error.
Echo showed good left heart function.
CT showed bilateral pneumonias as only potiential source for infection.
Resuscitation efforts were stopped when echo showed no heart movement (~15minutes total).
