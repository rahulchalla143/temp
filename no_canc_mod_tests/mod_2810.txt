She developed progressively worse shortness of breath and sent to the Emergency Department for evaluation by the visiting nurse.
In the Emergency Department the patient was temperature was 101.6.
Blood pressure 110/91.
Heart rate 119.
Respiratory rate 32.
Respiratory rate of 45 with stable O2 sats.
Chest x-ray shows positive for bilateral patchy infiltrates, Solu-Medrol 80 mg intravenous times one and intravenous normal saline times two liters.
Blood pressure 120/70.
Heart rate 114.
Respiratory rate 32.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 1.9, hematocrit 29.2, platelets 231, NA 137, K 4.0, CO 105, CO2 25, BUN 15, creatinine 0.6, glucose 215.
Initial blood cultures were negative.
Initial blood gas showed 7.33/57/39 with a lactate of 2.8.
A repeat arterial blood gas showed 7.32/28/49, lactate of 3.1.
She had a granulocyte count of 1370.
Chest x-ray showed heart within normal limits, hilar contours unremarkable.
A chest CT Was performed, which showed diffuse severe parenchymal lung disease with minimal uninvolved lung thus explaining the patient's significant respiratory distress even at rest.
All cultures remained negative throughout hospitalization including blood, urine and myolytic cultures.
After a long talk with the family it was decided that comfort should be the goal given the relapsing course of her illness and on [**2155-3-17**] antibiotics were discontinued.
A CT of the chest as mentioned before showed massive infiltration of the lung consistent with PCP pneumonia making oxygen saturation with noninvasive ventilation to an adequate degree largely impossible.
