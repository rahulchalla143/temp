Saw his new cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who repeated a nuclear stress test and echo which were reportedly negative and given NTG for the chest pressure.
The chest pressure is associated with mild SOB and nausea.
CBC and chem-7 unremarkable.
Patient cath revealed 2-vessel disease.
CT [**Doctor First Name **] made aware and will decide whether patient is a surgical candidate.
However, within ~ 15min of being on the floor, pt became acutely diaphoretic w/ chest pain [**6-21**] and hypotensive with SBP 56-60s.
His oxygen saturation went to its lowest at 91% on room air, increased to 95%, but then was put on a NRB, and had 100% saturations.
EKG was unchanged from prior.

ECHO [**2111-9-30**] - Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Cardiac cath [**10-2**]: final report is pending.
A DES was placed in the 80% RCA lesion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 34309**] is an 85 year-old male with PMH of COPD, HTN  and recent admission [**8-29**] to [**2111-8-31**] with chest pressure (negative stress test)who presented after 3-4 days of recurrent intermittent chest tightness/pressure and found to have LAD and RCA 80% stenosis.
Initial laboratory studies including CBC, Chem-7 and troponin were largely unremarkable.
An ECG showed prolonged PR but no other evidence of ischemia.
Given the patient's symptoms he was taken to cardiac cath and was found to have an 80% lesion at the ostium of the left anterior descending, and an 80% lesion in the right coronary artery involving the bifurcation of the posterior descending artery.
He was taken for catheterization after the pt decided he would like to have stents placed, rather than go through a CABG.
HTN - Held home anti-hyprtensives in the setting of being on the nitro gtt, but then re-initiated on his home atenolol as the drip was shut off and his blood pressure could tolerate it.
Anxiety - Pt was continued on his home lorazepam and ambien prn.
BPH - Pt was continued on his home tamsulosin.
An ACEi would be reasonable, but we did not start in house [**1-14**] dye load from catheterizations.
Outpatient Lab Work please check Chem-7 and CBC on Tuesday [**10-6**] with results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10813**] Fax: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34311**]  2.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname 34309**],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for chest pain.
A cardiac catheterization showed that you have multiple blockages in the blood vessels that feed your heart.
A second cardiac catheterization was done, in which a stent was placed in one of these blockages that was thought to be the cause of most of your pain.
