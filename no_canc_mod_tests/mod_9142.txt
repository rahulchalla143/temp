At that time, echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated significant mitral valve prolapse with severe mitral regurgitation and a large ventriculoseptal defect with a left to right shunt.
The patient remained with adequate heart rhythm and rate and blood pressure and was transferred out from the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit to the Telemetry Floor.
On postoperative day #5, the patient was noted to have some atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate between 90 and 125.
Chest x-ray was obtained.
The chest x-ray from the previous day revealed a significant left pleural effusion.
The subsequent chest x-ray showed decreased pleural effusion although some residual fluid remains with left lower lobe atelectasis and no pneumothorax noted.
Temperature is 98.6, blood pressure 110/70, heartrate 87 in normal sinus rhythm with a first degree atrioventricular block, respiratory rate 20.
Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, however, diminished lung space.
Her heart rhythm is regular with no rub or murmur noted.
Ventriculoseptal defect 4.
