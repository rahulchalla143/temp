She was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where CXR and KUB showed massive gastric dilatation and small bowel dilatation with stool/contrast in the rectum.
An NGT was placed with hurricane spray and pt aspirated.

Neuro: CT head ([**4-30**]) was performed at presentation as neurologic status could not be adequately assessed and precipitating insult was not confirmed.
She underwent trans-thoracic echocardiogram on [**5-9**] and [**5-17**], both studies showed good cardiac function (EF 65%).
PU: CT Chest on admission showed left lower lobe consolidation and peribronchial ground glass opacities bilaterally, thought to be due to infection with possible aspiration.
Repeat Chest CT on [**5-8**] showed interval worsening of the large left lower lobe consolidation and interval increase of innumerable small cavitary lesions compatible with diffuse dissemination of infection.
Repeat chest CT on [**5-21**] was consistent with worsening necrotizing pneumonia.
Repeat CT abd/pelv on [**5-8**] showed the anastamosis to be intact, no evidence of bowel obstruction and near-complete resolution of abdominal ascites and resolution of deep pelvic collection.
GU: Urine culture from [**5-7**] showed >100k yeast.
Renal ultrasound on [**5-18**] showed no evidence of fungal infection.
Foley was kept in place, and urine output remained adequate.
This drain was removed after 8 days and CT pelvis showed resolution of abscess.
Her antibiotic therapy changed frequently based on recommendations from the Infectious Disease consult team and her culture data.
Her white count continued to rise, and she was unable to be weaned off of the vent.
