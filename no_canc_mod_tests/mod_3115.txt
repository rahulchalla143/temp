**FINAL REPORT [**2197-12-8**]**    CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2197-12-8**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
[**12-9**] CXR: Compared to the study from the prior day, there is increased vascular congestion and increased volume loss in both lower [**Known lastname **]s. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
Her hematocrit in the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8.
Bronchoscopy on arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage most likely diagnosis.
Hct did not bump appropriately, found to have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool.
CT showed no intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
3+GNR in sputum stain, sputum culture growing ceftriaxone-sensitive E.coli.
Lasix drip was again attempted later in the hospital course with good response in urine output but not significant improvement in respiratory status.
On urine culture grew ceftriaxone-sensitive E.coli and antibiotic regimen was adjusted to cover.
Staghorn R kidney stone noted on CT could be contributing.
Urine has been progressively more clear and her urine output has improved on lasix drip.
#UTI: Ecoli with same sensitivity profile as the PEG swab culture and sputum isolated in urine.
Endoscopy by IP showed that peg balloon still in stomach, was re-positioned to decrease pressure on wall to better allow for healing.
Cultures of discharge shown to be E.coli, also sensitive to ceftriaxone.
CT confirmed PEG placement, dobhoff placement and r/o free air (final read pending).
# Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily.
CT w/PEG findings discussed above and porcelain gallbladder, but no evidence of intraperitoneal bleed or other intraabdominal process.
