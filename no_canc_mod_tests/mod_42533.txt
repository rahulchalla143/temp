On arrival, he had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of 15.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs:  Heart rate 96, blood pressure 170/119, oxygen saturation 86% on room air, with rebreather the patient was 99%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Extraocular movements intact, pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
The thoracic, lumbar and sacral spines were also without deformity.
Repeat chest x-ray after chest tube:  No pneumothorax, lung up.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cells 10, hematocrit 48.2, platelets 105.
Chemistries:  Sodium 145, potassium 4.4, chloride 101, bicarbonate 34, BUN 17, creatinine 1.0, glucose 171.
Lactate was 1.7.
Urinalysis showed moderate blood.
Urine toxicology screen positive for opiates.
Blood toxicology screen was positive for aspirin.
Oxygen saturations were 94% on 50% face mask.
Serial hematocrits were stable at 48.2, 43.4 and 38.9.
The patient's abdominal examination remained unremarkable, and the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Serial chest x-rays on postoperative day number five showed a left lower lobe collapse with an effusion which had improved from admission.
The following hospital day, cultures grew out 4+ gram-positive cocci and 3+ gram-negative rods, at which time he was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.
At that time, his white count came up to 13.3, and he was noted to have low-grade fevers at around 101.0.
Subsequent speciation revealed these to be hemophilus influenza beta-lactamase negative.
On [**2157-11-5**], the Thoracic Surgery service was consulted in order to assist with the management of this patient's undrained effusions, which by chest x-ray had shown a persistent effusion that did not layer, which is consistent with loculated fluid collection.
The ultrasound done on the 14th was consistent with a moderate left effusion with blood and fibrin, again consistent with loculations.
At that point, it was recommended that a CT scan be done of the chest to further evaluate and make clinical decisions.
CT scan done on [**2157-11-7**] showed that there was a left-sided chest tube with associated left hydropneumothorax.
Following this scan, it was thought by the Thoracic Surgery team that this study was consistent with a left hydropneumothorax with likely hemothorax.
The thinking was that a VATS with removal of all of the pleural debris would be a definitive clinical option.
His temperature subsequently decreased, and then x-ray done on [**2157-11-11**] showed that there was no evidence of pneumothorax, and there was a left lower lobe atelectasis and effusion, for which the patient was on continued incentive spirometry and chest physical therapy.
