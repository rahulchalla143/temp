Protein culture and sensitivity studies were pending at the time of discharge.
Here, as previously mentioned, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization with the previously mentioned results.
She had an electrocardiogram on the day after admission which showed  a normal sinus rhythm at 68, normal axis, and intervals.
She had a chest x-ray here at [**Hospital1 188**] which showed a heart size at the upper limit of normal, bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  Her laboratories on the day of discharge were as follows; her sodium was 140, potassium was 3.9, chloride was 107, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen was 11, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was 110.
Her blood pressure remained between 90 and 100 systolic, and she tolerated the ACE inhibitor and beta blocker well.
She did have some persistent nausea and some vomiting for the 24 hours status post catheterization which was treated successfully with Zofran.
