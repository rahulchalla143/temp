MRA/MRV of head FINDINGS:  There are diffuse areas of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the largest lesions involving the right anterior temporal lobe and right inferior frontal lobe with smaller hemorrhagic lesions noted scattered through the right frontal, right parietal, right occipital lobe, and left parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]  The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent with no areas of significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation.
MRV of the brain demonstrates no venous sinus thrombosis.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen  ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
MRI demonstrated L scalp hematoma, suggestive of trauma.
The patient was intially treated with antibiotics but ceased after cultures were negative.
EEG showed mild right frontal slowing.
Formal testing of power difficult due to variable effort but appears full.
Review of imaging studies revealed no concensus regarding etiology of lesions.
MRV was negative for venous sinus thrombosis.
Drug toxicology screens were negative, but note possible substances not captured on screening.
LP was performed and negative for cryptococcus, toxoplasmosi, neurocysticercosis.
Inflammatory markers were elevated on admission and trended down.
Question of possible bleeding metastatic lesions explored with testicular ultrasound which was normal aside from epipidymal cysts.
CT abdomen demonstrated hypodensity in the liver likely due to early fatty infiltration.
CT chest suggested small RLL PE.
