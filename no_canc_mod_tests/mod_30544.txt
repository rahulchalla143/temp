She received atropine and had an LMA placed by EMS, BP 80/40 while en route to [**Hospital 8**] hospital.
At [**Hospital1 8**], she was found to have blood around her mouth, BRBPR, hct of 27, creatinine 3.2 & INR of 10.5.
She underwent proper ETT intubation and initial ABG 7.3/38/200/19 before family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 93 P 65 BP 122/72 R 14 O2 sat 100%.
Vent AC Fi02 100% Vt 400, Peep 5, RR 16.
Pt received another 2units of FFP at [**Hospital1 **] and repeat hct was 20.
After she was settled, sBPs dropped from 87 to 70s, pt was given 2L NS IVF and started on Dopamine.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT ABD/PELVIS: Large bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe compressive atelectasis.
Her INR was reversed and pt was transfused appropriately and pt started on IV PPI.
Pt did not have further bleeding with her INR <2.
Pt's blood pressure was managed c pressors and gentle fluid boluses, however, her kidneys did not recover.
Throughout this time pt had experienced occasional atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response which was treated with metoprolol IV as pt had NSTEMI on admission and it was felt that heart rates >120s might induce further demand ischemia.
