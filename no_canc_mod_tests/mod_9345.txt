CXR in ED was suggestive of left lower lobe consolidation.
Blood cultures came back positive for Ecoli that was also sensitive to cefepime and therefore likely urosepticiemia.
-Doxazosin was discontinued as he dropped his blood pressure while on this and was no longer having urinary retention at the time of discharge.
#Ecoli Bacteremia-patient had blood cultures that grew EColi with similar sensitivities to -will need to finish Cefepime on [**2124-9-23**] for a 7 day course from day 1 of negative cultures on [**2124-9-17**] -blood cutlures from [**9-17**], 15, and 16 were NGTD at the time of discharge and final cultures will be monitored by his inpatient team and communicated with his PCP if they become positive  # h/o cholangitis s/p chole: At admission the patient reported abdominal pain.
Serial abdominal exams were unremarkable.
Denied symptoms of chest pain, chest pressure or fatigue at admission.
His Lisinopril was still held and will need to be restarted for cardioprotective effects once it is clear that he is tolerating his metoprolol -restart lisinopril 2.5 mg po qday if tolerating betablocker -consider switching metop tartrate back to succinate when discharged back home for convenience -continued aspirin and atorvastatin  # Emphysema: Stable.
H/o possible obstructive ventalitory defect on PFTs from [**2117**] and CT scan with evidence of emphysema.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -continue cefepime IV through [**9-23**] -continue vancomycin IV through [**9-20**] -restart lisinopril 2.5mg po qday once blood pressure stable on metoprolol -Labs pending at the time of discharge (blood cultures from [**9-17**], [**9-18**], [**9-19**])- will be followed-up by inpatient team -> final results showed no growth  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
