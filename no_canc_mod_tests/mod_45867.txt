The hemodynamics on catheterization demonstrated a right atrial pressure of 15, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is 23, cardiac output of 5.57, and cardiac index of 2.91.
The patient ruled in for a ST elevation inferior wall myocardial infarction with a peak creatinine kinase of 3,219 and creatinine kinase MB of 258.
A post myocardial infarction transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated decreased left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 40 to 50% secondary to moderate hypokinetic basal and mid ventricular segments of the inferior and posterior free wall of the left ventricle.
The echocardiogram also demonstrated 1+ mitral regurgitation, normal left ventricular size and wall thickness, and normal right ventricular size and function.
The patient had a lipid panel which demonstrated hypertriglyceridemia with a normal low density lipoprotein on Zocor.
The patient's hematocrit at the time was 34.1 and the hematocrit subsequently trended down to 27.4 on hospital day #6.
The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on hospital day #6 for a goal hematocrit greater than 28.0.
The repeat hematocrit is pending at time of this dictation.
Iron studies are also pending at time of this dictation.
Stool guaiacs are negative to date.
The patient was started on an insulin drip with a maximum rate of 10 units per hour.
The insulin drip was discontinued on hospital day #2 with continued one to two hour fingerstick glucose checks and sliding scale insulin.
The patient had a hemoglobin A1c of 9.0 measured on admission.
The patient's blood glucose remained poorly controlled during the hospitalization on sliding scale insulin with blood glucoses ranging in the 200's to 300's.
Per Neurology recommendations, a head MRI / MRA as well as EEG were obtained.
The head MRI / MRA was without evidence of infarction, mass, or flow abnormality.
The EEG is pending at time of this dictation.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with total occlusion of the right coronary artery and is now status post stent angioplasty and stent placement.
