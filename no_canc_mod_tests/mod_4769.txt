Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 is unchanged.
Minimal anterolisthesis of C6 on C7 is also unchanged.

Prominence of the thyroid isthmus, not significantly changed compared to CT from [**2150-1-13**].

Grade 1 retrolisthesis of L4 on L5 is not significantly changed.
Distention of the gallbladder, cholelithiasis, and mild intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation are not significantly changed.
While a superimposed acute process such as multifocal pneumonia may be considered, the overall appearance, in the setting of a prior known cancer, is suggestive of possible lymphangitic spread.
Consider followup chest CT for more detailed evaluation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2151-7-22**] - CT w/o contrast: 1.
Continued followup as recommended on that study is appropriate.

While in the ICU she developed hematemesis, which was felt to be due to anticoagulation and her underlying pneumonia.
Anticoagulation was held, and she underwent bronchoscopy which did not find any evidence of cancer recurrence.
C difficile toxin was negative times three, and stool PCR was also negative.
Her diarrhea slowed but did not resolve during her hospitalization, and was thought to be secondary to antibiotic associated diarrhea as well as cessation of narcotic pain medications (see below).
She maintained good oral intake and her electrolytes remained stable despite ongoing diarrhea.
Patient was bridged back to Coumadin with Heparin, and was discharged on a dose of 5mg (last five doses prior to discharge: 5, 5, 5, 7.5, 7.5; INR at discharge 3.1).
They were slowly re-started, and her lisinopril was increased from 10mg to 20mg.

Outpatient Lab Work Please have your INR checked on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**8-6**], with the results faxed to the [**Hospital3 **].
We stopped your blood thinners for some time and we discussed bronchoscopy to reveal the source of bleeding and rule out the possibility of lung cancer coming back.
The bronchoscopy showed no evidence of cancer.
We resumed your blood thinners (coumadin) and you are being sent home on 5mg.
