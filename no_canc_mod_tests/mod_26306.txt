There, her vitals were (at 2040): 217/121, 74, 16, 98% RA.
NCHCT was done and she was found to have an intracerebral hemorrhage - 7 slices approx 2x4 cm with lateral ventricle extension.
Upon arrival, vitals were 98.1, 66, 117/108, 18, 98%RA.
Her BP fell to 97/52, then later rose to 197/92 (very labile).
Repeat head CT here shows worse bleed, left sided, on 8 slices, 2x6 cm with extension to the lateral and 3rd ventricles and mass effect on the lateral ventricle without overt shift left to right.

[**11-1**] Head CT NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage extending through the white matter of the left insula and the left thalamus, irregularly shaped, but measuring up to 6.0 cm in transverse dimension.
The degree of hemorrhage has worsened since the study of [**Hospital1 9191**].
Head CT [**11-2**]: Increase in the volume of intracerebral hemorrhage, accompanied by slight increase in mass effect, left to right midline shift, and blood within the left lateral ventricle.
Head CT [**11-3**], [**11-4**]:  Similar appearance of large cerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage.
[**11-15**] Chest/Abd/Pelvis CT - Circumferential bowel wall thickening seen in the cecum.
If required, a chest CT could be obtained for further evaluation.
Serial head CTs displayed mild worsening in hemorrhage and mass effect with worsening of mental status, requiring intubation.
Head CT stable since [**11-3**].
