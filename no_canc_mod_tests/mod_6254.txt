In the ED his vitals were: T 99.3, HR 102, BP 134/74, R 18, and O2 sat 100% on room air.
Labs were drawn and significant for a glucose of 377, Anion Gap of  24, lactate of 1.2 and ketones in this urine, consistent with Diabetic Ketoacidosis.
He was stable with a heart rate of  77 and a blood pressure of 140/66.
Podiatry reported that plain film imaging showed "interval osteolysis adjacent to the fixation screws that is suggestive of infection or interval losening".
Blood and swab cultures were obtained, and a urine culture was negative for growth.

Podiatry reported that plain film imaging showed "interval osteolysis adjacent to the fixation screws that is suggestive of infection or interval loosening".
Blood and swab cultures were obtained, and a urine culture was negative for growth.
He also developed a allergic reaction on his back, which appeared as erythematous, non-raised target lesions.
Wound cultures grew Klebissela pneuomiae with sensitivites to Cipro, Meropenum, Gent, ceftriaxone and less sensitivities to Zosyn, amp/sublactam.
Wound cultures came back with gram positive cocci, so he was started on Keflex PO 500mg qid (first dose [**2149-2-26**].)Mr.
Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient presented to the emergency department with a glucose of 377, Anion Gap of  24, lactate of 1.2 and ketones in this urine, consistent with Diabetic Ketoacidosis.
His anion gap eventually close, he glucose was controlled in the 150-240's range, and his anion gap closed before he was admitted to the medicine floor.
Upon discharge his glucose was stable at 163 and his anion gap was 12. .
Anemia: [**Known lastname 14611**] had a hematocrit of 27.3 on admission, with a range of 24.4 to 28.3, with a discharge hematocrit of 26.7.
Two units of blood were cross and matched, but a transfusion was not needed.
His anemia was stable at discharge.
Dermatology consulted on the patient, and a biopsy was performed and found to be consistent with a drug reaction, although erythema multiforme could not be excluded.
