TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain was performed without the use of intravenous contrast.
MRA of the head was obtained utilizing time-of-flight technique (no intravenous gadolinium contrast).
MRA of the neck was performed both before and after the administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast, utilizing bolus triggering and subtraction technique.
Complex multiplanar reformatted images were obtained of the MRA of the head and MRA of the neck.
MRA of head and neck is unremarkable, without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, dissection, or aneurysm (within the limitations of the MRA technique).
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Please see operative note for details which included cardiac arrest x2.
Multiple bronchoscopies were performed for secretions/ pulm.
EEG done [**1-29**] revealed severe encephalopathy for continuing neurologic deficits including bilat.
MRI revealed multiple acute infarcts, with the largest in the right occipital lobe.
