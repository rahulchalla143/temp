She was initially admitted here on [**6-27**] and had a CT of her airway done revealing tracheobronchomalacia.
Her bp remained stable on admission, and was in the 130s-140s/70s-80s throughout the day on [**6-27**] and [**6-28**].
On [**6-29**], her bp was 100/80 at 8 am (pulse 92 from 82), 92/43 at noon, and 87/54 at 4 pm (pulse 104).
[**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes her bp was 62/palp (75/p w/doppler), pulse 120, respirations 32, and 98% on 3L.
Of note, her INR was subtherapeutic on admission at 1.4, and she was begun on a heparin drip (due to AVR).
Her PTT was greater than 150 since 6 pm last night, and despite adjustments in the heparin gtt it was last measured at 147.5.
Initial CXR was clear.
On [**6-20**], she became acutely SOB and CXR showed LUL infiltrate.
Swallow study was negative for aspiration.
Her creatinine fluctuated between 1.8 and 2, and was 3 on discharge from the OSH.
Renal ultrasound showed R kidney 10.2 cm w/mult cysts, left normal, no hydro.
She had a negative C diff there, blood cx negative x2, urine cx negative.
ABG 7.40/40/77 on [**6-21**].
Bronchiectasis 4.
COPD/restrictive lung disease FEV1 680 ml (39% pred) in [**2174**] unchanged from [**2168**], TLC 63% pred 6.
PVD 7.
CKD, felt [**1-4**] diabetes, baseline Cr 1.4 14.

CT Trachea [**2176-6-28**] IMPRESSION:  1.
CT Abd/Pelvix [**2176-6-30**] IMPRESSION: 1.
There are again seen scattered areas of ill-defined ground glass opacity and bronchiectatic changes within the lungs bilaterally, which are not significantly changed in comparison to most recent study from two days prior.
Echo [**2176-7-2**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CXR [**2176-7-4**]: IMPRESSION:  1.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo woman with tracheobronchomalacia, on heparin gtt for [**Hospital 64315**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH for IP evaluation and possible Y stent who was transferred to the MICU for hypotension, decreased Hct in the setting of retroperitoneal bleed.
On CT scan, she was found to have a large right pelvic side wall hematoma with extension into the right rectus muscle.
We monitored her Hct closely during the acute episodes q4.
Although her Hct stabilized, when we attempted to start anticoagulation with warfarin again at low doses, she subsequently developed a decreasing hematocrit which required further transfusions of FFP and Hct.
While attempting slow increase of coumadin to reach therapeutic INR for her AVR, she began further dropping her HCT with increase of her INR to 1.8.
ARF on CRI - After developing hypotension, she became anuric.
Elevated WBC count - She was hypothermic and met criteria for SIRS but this is all likely explained by hypovolemic shock.
She ultimately had a gram stain positive for gram positive cocci in her sputum (culture negative to date [**7-13**]), from [**2176-7-10**].
CV: pump - anti-hypertensives were held given hypotension.
her cardiac enzymes were negative.
Prophylaxis - She was maintained on PPI and pneumoboots while in the hospital.
