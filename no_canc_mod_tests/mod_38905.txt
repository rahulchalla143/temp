CXR [**2119-7-15**]: The right IJ central line tip in the SVC is unchanged.
CTA Chest [**2119-7-24**]: 1.
EKG [**2119-7-24**]: Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2119-7-22**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
EKG and troponins were negative.
CXR showed no new pathology.
Chest CTA revealed a L-sided pulmonary embolism and a R-sided mass (resolving PNA vs atelectasis vs tumor).
# Neutropenia: WBC nadir at 0.1 on [**2119-7-18**], likely secondary to Cytoxan and sepsis.
# DVT/PE: Started on heparin drip in hospital for DVT and PE (diagnosed by CTA) with goal PTT 60-100.
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: On [**7-15**], in ICU pt had episode of A fib with RVR that responded poorly to beta-blockers/calcium channel blockers due to hypotension but later resolved with IV Amiodarone.
# Pulmonary findings on CT: On [**2119-7-24**], a CTA chest was performed to assess for PE.
A 6-week follow-up CT scan was arranged and outpatient pulmonary follow-up has been scheduled.
Her CT findings were not believed to be consistent with pulmonary Goodpasture's.
Retic on [**2119-7-19**] was 1.4, Hct was 30, which trended later down to 21.8.
# Chest Pain: Ranges from 0/10 to 5/10 intensity.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  - Amiodarone taper as above and follow-up with Cardiology for further management of atrial fibrillation.
Once INR [**3-17**] for 2 days, can stop Heparin and continue coumadin for 6 months.
- Pulmonology follow-up and repeat CT chest have been arranged for abnormal CT finding.

You were also started on anticoagulation for your deep venous thromboses (DVT - blood clots) in your legs.
A CT-scan of your lungs showed a pulmonary embolus (PE - blood clot in lung), which also requires anticoagulation.
