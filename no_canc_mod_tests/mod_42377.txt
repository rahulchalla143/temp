Followup chest CT in three months was recommended to ensure stability.
[**2111-11-24**] Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2111-11-25**] CXR  In comparison with study of [**11-24**], the opacification at the left base has substantially cleared with some residual atelectatic change.
[**2111-11-25**] Head CT FINDINGS: There is moderate prominence of sulci and ventricles indicating brain atrophy.
Although the ventricular enlargement is slightly out of proportion for sulci, there is widening of the sulci seen at the convexity and therefore the appearance from CT is not typical for normal pressure hydrocephalus.
The day following admission, the patient had recurrent fever to 102 and chest discomfort; ecg and biomarkers did not suggest myocardial injury, and blood/urine cx were unrevealing.
The following day after iniation of heparin, she was started on warfarin 7.5mg (on [**11-24**] and [**11-25**]), but developed quickly a supratherapeutic INR to 5.4 and to 7.5 on discharge [**2111-11-28**].
At time of discharge, her INR is : 3.5 ([**2111-11-29**]) and her warfarin was HELD since [**2111-11-25**].
Her PCP [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 335**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5351**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5828**] will follow her INRs and warfarin management.
Her SPEP and UPEP were without abnormalities.
She was found to be vitamin D deficient, and was started on LOW dose vitamin D 400 IU daily, a lower dose given possible rise in her calcium levels further if she were given high dose.
Echo did not show decreased ejection fraction and was not suggestive of hemodynamic effects of PE.
Her BP began to rise the day prior to discharge, and she was started on her home lisinopril at 1/2 dose to start (20mg on [**2111-11-28**], her home dose is 40mg PO daily).
Given anticoagulation, a head CT was checked before history was confirmed that patient had dementia, and was negative for territorial infarction or hemorrhage.
# Incidentally noted pulmonary nodule, liver lesion: Should repeat CT as an outpatient was recommended assess for stability.
