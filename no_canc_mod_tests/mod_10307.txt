In the Emergency Department, the patient was found with a temperature of 102.2, heart rate was 137, blood pressure was 123/64, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air, and respiratory rate was 28.
The initial chest x-ray was without evidence of infiltrate; however, a computed tomography angiogram was obtained given the patient's complaint of primary care physician and evidence of sinus tachycardia.
The computed tomography angiogram demonstrated a left lingular infiltrate, and the patient was started on levofloxacin and nebulizer treatments.
Shortly thereafter, the patient became progressively hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s with worsening shortness of breath.
The patient was electively intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure with an arterial blood gas of 7.22/50/407 on assist-control, tidal volume of 700, respiratory rate of 12, and FIO2 of 100%.
The patient's initial laboratories were notable for a white blood cell count of 18.8 (with 12% bands), a blood glucose of 412, with trace ketonuria, and an anion gap of 13.
The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring and evaluation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed temperature was 101.2, blood pressure was 102/68, pulse was 128, respiratory rate was 24, oxygen saturation was 96% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no extra heart sounds appreciated.
Pulmonary examination revealed diffusely scattered wheezes and rhonchi anteriorly and posteriorly.
Abdominal examination revealed soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories and studies on admission revealed complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 18.8, hematocrit was 43.6, and platelets were 195.
White blood cell differential revealed 75% neutrophils, 12% bands, 4% lymphocytes, and 2% monocytes.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 132, potassium was 4, chloride was 95, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen was 19, creatinine was 0.9, and blood glucose was 412, with an anion gap of 14.
Urinalysis was notable for greater than 1000 glucose, greater than 80 ketones, with 0 white blood cells and 0 red blood cells.
Microbiologic studies notable during this admission included a sputum culture from [**2139-11-27**] with moderate streptococcal pneumococci.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Radiologic studies of note included a chest computed tomography on admission which was notable for left lingular infiltrate with no evidence for pleural effusion of pericardial effusion, and no evidence intraluminal filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolus.
A repeat chest computed tomography on hospital day six (on [**2139-12-2**]) demonstrated ground-glass opacification and consolidation in the lung apices with additional patchy areas of opacification in the periphery of the right middle lobe and lingua.
The vancomycin was discontinued after one day, and following the results of a sputum culture from admission with evidence of moderate pneumococci, the Levaquin was discontinued after completion of five days.
For the first eight days of the hospitalization, the patient demonstrated a persistently elevated white blood cell count with bandemia (maximum white blood cell count was 16.6 with 26% bands) and persistent fever (ranging from 100 to 103).
All blood cultures were without growth including multiple catheter tip cultures.
Clostridium difficile toxin results were negative, and after imaging, the effusions were too small to tap.
Serial chest x-rays demonstrated improving multilobar pneumonia with development of very small bilateral pleural effusions.
After hospital day one, the patient continued off of blood pressure support with systolic blood pressures ranging from 130 to 160.
