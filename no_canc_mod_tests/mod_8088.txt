Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  White count of 5.2, hematocrit of 40.7, platelets of 302.
Sodium of 140, potassium of 4, chloride of 100, bicarbonate of 23, BUN of 19, creatinine of 0.9, glucose of 103, calcium 9.7, magnesium 1.8, phosphate 4.0.
PT 16.3, PTT 41.9, INR of 1.8.
Patient received a chest x-ray which was normal without focal consolidation or pleural effusion.
ENT consult was obtained and found no evidence on fiberoptic examination of any recent bleeding in patient's nose.
CT Scan of the patient's chest was obtained to evaluate for possible recurrent pulmonary emboli.
CT Scan showed interval stable 2 mm nodule left lung apex, notable for interval appearance of patchy areas of ground-glass opacifications in the right lower lobe and additional patches of ground-glass opacification in the right middle lobe.
CT Scan with contrast was repeated.
The scan showed significant recanalization of the left pulmonary arterial system with extensive retraction revascularization of previously noted pulmonary emboli.
On [**2142-1-4**], patient underwent flexible and rigid bronchoscopy which showed a large blood clot obstruction right lower lobe bronchus which after suctioning revealed a small polypoid lesion at the take off the right lower lobe bronchus with a stream of pulsatile blood emanating from it.
Serial hematocrits showed no drop in patient's hematocrit status post argon beam therapy.
Hematocrit remained stable.
