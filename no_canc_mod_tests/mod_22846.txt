So her ASA 325mg was decreased to 81mg.
her BP was "running high" so she was increased back to Atenolol 25mg qday.
During the exam she had some additional nausea when standing her up during the physical exam and a STAT repeat HCT was obtained which showed an increase in size of the L frontal ICH3->4cm, intraparenchymal hemorrhage and + SAH without IVH spread or midline shift.

CT Head without Contrast ([**2170-10-14**]): Stable left inferior frontal lobe hemorrhage with SAH and mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle from the study done 4 hrs.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2170-10-15**]): IMPRESSIONS: Inferior left frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema and local mass effect, diffuse left cerebral hemisphere subarachnoid hemorrhages, and intraventricular extension are not changed from 17 hours prior.
MRI/MRA Head ([**2170-10-15**]): Areas of intraparenchymal hematoma in the left frontal lobe with mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], is redemonstrated.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2170-10-16**]): No change since [**2170-10-15**].
CXR ([**2170-10-16**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary infectious process on single plain chest examination.
A non-contrast CT of the head demonstrated a left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.
An MRI, performed to evaluate for evidence of ischemia, confirmed CT findings.
Angiography studies showed that the major intracranial vessels were patent.
Furthermore, vessel imaging failed to suggest the presence of an AVM and other contributory abnormalities.
Particularly in the setting of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, blood pressure control with a target systolic blood pressure of 120 to 160 was an important focus of care.
All: PCN - unknown   Discharge Medications: 1.
A CT scan revealed bleeding in the brain, and you were transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Repeat imaging demonstrated stability of the hemorrhage and surrounding swelling.
