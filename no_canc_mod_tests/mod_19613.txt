He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, however review of the EKG showed severe EKG changes.
Surgery was consulted because the patient developed cardiogenic shock acidosis and hypotension and intraaortic balloon pump was placed which stabilized his hemodynamics although he continued to be somewhat hypotensive and acidotic.
On physical examination, his BP was 90/50 on the intraaortic ballon pump with elevated filling pressures, HR was 90 BPM.
Lung exam showed bilateral rales.
Cardiac exam showed distant heart sounds.
Neurologic exam was grossly normal.
Ejection fraction initially was 20-30% with pulmonary hypertension and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
His mixed venous oxygen saturation was approximately 48%, suggesting poor peripheral perfusion and shock.
His filling pressures were elevated with a CVP of about 25 mmHg.
His chest was reopened but his hemodynamics did not significantly change.
Cardiogenic shock, treated with IABP and emergency CABG x 3.
