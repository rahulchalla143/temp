Blood transfusion 2.
Interventional radiology tagged red blood cell scan with attempted percutaneous ablation.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y/o male with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CKD stage III, COPD, chronic venostasis, systolic CHF (EF of 45%-50%) who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with several episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
His hematocrit was noted to be 41 upon presentation which dropped to 27.5 approximately 6 hours later.
His INR was 3.2 and his creatinine was 1.7.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and IR intervention.
He had a colonsocpy on [**2175-11-18**] which showed persistent active bleeding with diffuse clots suggestive of diverticular bleed in the setting of anticoagulation with coumadin and was transferred to the intensive care unit.
The patient's INR was reversed with FFP and he also received vitamin K.  He also required blood transfusion.
Ultrasound of his internal jugular showed collapse suggestive of volume depletion.
CHF with an EF of 45%.

Chronic systolic heart failure with EF 45%.
He was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells as well 3 units of FFP and vitamin K for an INR of 3.2.
Surgical and GI services were consulted who recommended a tagged RBC scan which was notable for extravasation in the sigmoid.
He received 3 more units of red cells to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30.
His bleeding ceased without intervention by hospital day 2 and his hematocrit remained stable for 4 consecutive days.
On hospital day 3, his metoprolol and lasix were resumed and his blood pressure remained stable.
INR monitoring 3.
Coumadin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Start on Wednesday [**2175-4-5**], Goal INR [**2-10**] .
Coumadin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Start on Wednesday [**2175-4-5**], Goal INR [**2-10**] .
In the 4 days that followed your blood counts remained stable.
Going forward it is very important that you closely monitor your INR or coumadin level so that your blood does not become too thin.
You must also monitor for early signs of bleeding; these include increased amounts of bright red blood in your stool, lightheadedness or fast heart rate which may be felt a palpitations.
You will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], your parimary care doctor, tomorrow [**2175-4-5**] and your INR will be checked at this visit.
