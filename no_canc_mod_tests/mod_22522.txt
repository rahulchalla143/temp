Fetal ultrasound results were    as follows.
Ultrasound at 20 showed an AFI for 20 with an    estimated fetal weight of the 84th percentile.
At 23 weeks    AFI was 45 with an estimated fetal weight in the 94th    percentile.
At 26 weeks AFI of 40, estimated fetal weight    of 87th percentile.
At 29 weeks AFI of 46, estimated fetal    weight in 98th percentile.
A 29 week ultrasound    also showed mild ventriculomegaly with lateral ventricles    measuring 13 mm bilaterally and a prominent cavum septum    pellucidum.
An MRI on [**3-3**] which was at 29 weeks was    consistent with ultrasound report and frontal horns were    noted to be slightly squared in appearance.
Anticardiolipin antibody weekly positive and treated with    heparin until 14 weeks gestation followed by baby aspirin    until 24 weeks gestation.
Infant was admitted to the NICU:  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission weight 2680 grams, length 48 cm, head circumference 33.25 cm.
Heart rate 160s, respiratory rate in the 60's, oxygen saturation on room air 75%, blood pressure of 83/47 with temperature of 97.8.
On day of li fe #1 patient was extubated to room air and has remained on room air since day of life #1 with saturations greater than 93%.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: Patient was initially    n.p.o.
on total fluid of 60 cc per kilo per day.
A renal ultrasound was performed    which showed a dual collecting system but was otherwise    normal.
On day of life #6 a set of electrolytes were obtained and t he    potassium was found to be 6.9.
On repeat testing of the electrolytes they wer e    found to be normal with a potassium of 5.4.
Repeat again th is    morning showed a potassium of 5.1.
GASTROINTESTINAL: Patient was started on phototherapy on    day of life #3 for a bilirubin of 14.0/0.5.
Phototherapy    was stopped on day of life #6 and rebound bilirubin was    8.5/0.3.
CBC and    blood culture were obtained.
CBC was benign and blood    culture was negative at 48 hours and therefore antibiotics    were discontinued.
NEUROLOGIC: Due to ventriculomegaly noted on prenatal    ultrasound a head ultrasound was performed on day of #1    and was essentially normal with the exception of a large    septum cavum pellucidum.
Prematurity at 32 4/7 weeks.
Weight loss of nearly 20 percent from birth.
