He is now transferred here after CT of the head at OSH showed a 2.5cm x 2.4cm left thalamic ICH with slight rupture into the ventricle.

Comparison with previous radiographs would help to better assess for long-term interval change.
Diagnostic considerations include asymmetric pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
Chest CT: Small right and moderate left pleural effusions, probably not transudate, greater and maybe loculated in the left side.
Head CT [**1-25**]: The left thalamic hemorrhage is similar in size, measuring 2.6 x 2.4 cm.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
His blood pressure was difficult to control (see below).
His exam remained unchanged with severe dysarthria, slight right hemiparesis, and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status most likely secondary to metabolic encephalopathy (see medical problems listed below).
2. hypertension - His blood pressure remained poorly controlled initially: metoprolol was initiated but was ineffective.
Hydralazine was added and was initially successful at controlling the blood pressure, but his blood pressure increased again when the metoprolol was weaned.
A CXR on admission showed a loculated pleural effusion on the left, which was not seen on previous x-rays.
The pulmonary service was consulted, and performed a diagnostic thoracentesis, which was consistent with a transudative effusion.
ECHO was performed, which showed... Diuresis was started.
A chest CT showed emphysematous changes.
4. elevated alkaline phos - His alk phos remained elevated during his hospitalization.
GGT was elevated, but abdominal ultrasound was negative.
FeNa was 0.22% and urine eosinophils were negative, no hydronephrosis on abdominal ultrasound.
An NGT was placed by IR on [**1-26**], and tube feeds started [**1-28**].
