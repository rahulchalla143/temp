The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
TTE ([**2190-4-6**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior and posterior akinesis.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
