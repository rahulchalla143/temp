Her CVP was in the high teens after this resuscitation.

CT Abd IMPRESSION: 1.
Here blood pressure on arrival was in the 90-110.
When her BP was above 105 she was given lopressor 5mg, her heart rate came down to the 110-120 range.
However her BP dropped again in response to the rate control and she required levophed.
Her CVP was measured in the high 20's A-line was placed by surgery and correlated well with her non-invasives.
Despite pressors and fluids her BP remained in the 80's and her heart rate in the 120's.
On admission to MICU labs were redrawn which demonstrated stable creatininedecrease bicarb, hypernatremia.
Her LFT's and amylase/lipase were still normal despite evidence of pancreatitis on CT and possibler CBD dilatation.
ABG at this time was 7.01/63/119.
She was given epinephrine and responded with BP increaing into the 180's and HR 150-160's.
Immediately after intubation ABG was 6.91/54/210, free Ca 0.97, lactate 8.4, AG 11, K 5.9.
Her heart rate was still in the 130's but her pressures were stable so attempted dilt gtt.
This time both her heart rate and blood pressure decreased.
Repeat labs now showed K 6.7, Na 153, AG 14, Cr 2.1, ABG 7.04/67/133.
Her pressure then continued to fall and repeat gas about 45 minutes later was 6.97/52/90.
During the evaluation and work up of the patient ECG showed rapid afib.
After the ECG changes were noted the ECG was faxed to the on call cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 17300**] [**Name (STitle) **] who felt that there was no significant ischemic changes compared to old ECG's.
Possible causes for the patients condition include myocardial ischemia(however had no significant trop leak, and no significant ECG changes per cardiology), PE(however she was with INR of >2 from recent labs and was 3.6 then 1.7 in the ED), ischemic bowel(no bowel wall thickening on CT, but did have AG acidosis and elevated lactate), sepsis(empirically given vanco and levofloxacin however no identifiable source was found on intial eval.)
