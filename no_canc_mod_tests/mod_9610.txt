Patient's INR should be checked three times per week and the Warfarin dose should be adjusted to maintain an INR between 2 and 3.
He was found unresponsive and dehydrated with blood sugar in the 30's.
First CPK at the time and troponin were negative and no work-up was done at the time for his left bundle branch block.
However, he was noted to have dark stool and a hematocrit around 25.
CPK and troponin were checked and the first set was found to be negative, second set to be positive.
His first CPK was 243 with an MB index of 15.6, troponin greater than 50.
He was found on EKG to have an intermittent left bundle branch block with a white blood cell count of 12.4 and no reported fevers.
However, chest x-ray was negative but leukocyte esterase and many bacteria were found on the urinalysis.
On [**2198-7-14**], in the morning the patient was noted to have chest pain, systolic blood pressure to the 70's with new ST elevations in 2, 3, and AVF.
CPK was greater than 730 and MB index was 11.7.
White blood cell count was found to be 30.6 with gram negative rods in his urine.
Blood pressure did not respond to intravenous therapy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient's examination was consistent with a 99.1 temperature, 125/81 blood pressure, on the Dopamine drip, pulse 84, respiratory rate of 28, saturation of 100%.
CVP 11 and 12.
He was on IMV 650 by 10, total volume of 500 and 50% O2 saturation, 5 of PEEP, ABG 7.39, 50 and 102, Lactate 1.1, calcium ionized at 1.06.
Normocephalic, atraumatic, head anicteric, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, dry mucus membranes.
His rectal exam showed guaiac positive.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 20.2 with diff of 90.9 neutrophils, 0 bands, 4.6 lymphocytes, 29.3 hematocrit, platelet count 313,000, MCV 89.
Coags 15.0 PT, 84.3 PTT and a 1.6 INR.
SMA, 142, 4.1, 104, 29, 29 BUN and creatinine 0.5, 275 glucose, calcium 7.5, magnesium 2.3, phosphorus 3.2, albumin 2.5, CPK was 691, MB 81, MB index 11.7, troponin greater than 50.
Urinalysis was positive, nitrite negative, leukocyte esterase, 5 reds, 14 white blood cells and moderate bacteria.
Blood culture times two were sent.
Sputum culture times one was sent.
Urine culture times one was sent and were all pending at the time of admission.
EKG on [**6-27**] found a left bundle branch block pacing at 100.
Chest x-ray showed no CHF, question of cardiomegaly, right upper lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates  HOSPITAL COURSE:  He had a central venous line placed, a right four lumen catheter was put in and in addition: 1.
He was evaluated and the EKG was consistent with an anterior myocardial infarction.
Again he was kept on the Heparin and the Warfarin and then the Heparin was discontinued when the INR reached between 2 and 3.
The patient received, during the course of his stay, three units of packed red blood cells because we wanted to keep his hematocrit above the level of 30 based on his coronary artery disease.
The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**7-17**].
Left ventricle had an ejection fraction of 30-40%, the left atrium was normal in size, left ventricular wall thicknesses were normal, the left ventricular cavity size was normal.
A TEE was done on [**7-19**], it was done for two reasons: 1) To find out if the patient had bacteremia, whether there was any evidence of endocarditis subsequent to increasing white count and the TEE was negative for endocarditis.
Patient's blood pressure was low.
The patient was eventually, after his blood pressure became more normal, kept on Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid and Captopril 6.25 mg po tid for the cardio protection of his heart subsequent to his anterior myocardial infarction and he was also, for a brief period of time, treated with, instead of Captopril, Hydralazine 10 mg po IV qid with Isosorbide Dinitrate 10 mg tid while the patient was in renal failure.
The Metoprolol and Captopril should be given in a staggered way such that the patient's blood pressure does not bottom out when the medications are given together.
He was maintained between pressor support levels of 10 and 20 during that week and then after secretions were reduced, he was returned to trach mask and pressure support trials, however, he was not able to be weaned entirely.
An A line was replaced on [**7-26**] secondary to several blood gases because the patient had not been tolerating 18 hours of trach mask very well.
On admission the patient's creatinine was 0.5 and went up to 1.8 and then went back to .9 by [**7-27**].
On [**7-14**] he also had blood cultures 1/4 positive for MRSA.
In between that, he went into acute renal failure so his Vancomycin was changed from q 12 hours to dosing by Vanco levels below 15.
Sputum was sent again.
On [**7-17**] the patient had a blood culture showing coag negative staff and elevated white blood cell count.
The TTE and TEE were both negative for endocarditis.
On [**7-19**] the patient had four bottles of blood culture sent and no growth to date has been from them and he has had no blood cultures positive since then.
A C. diff toxin was done and he was positive for C. diff.
CT abdomen on [**7-23**] showed bilateral pleural effusions, multiple colonic diverticula without signs of diverticulitis and degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine as prescribed in the full report.
The CT was done to find additional signs of infection and that was eventually found to be due to C. diff and the patient's white count went up to the 20's and then started to trend down again once being treated with the PO Metronidazole for his C. diff.
The patient had a chest x-ray on [**7-26**] which showed a left retrocardiac collapse/consolidation, improved appearance of CHF with bilateral small pleural effusions.
Again, the patient had a chest x-ray in the middle of his course which showed a pseudomonal pneumonia in the left lower lobe.
He had elevated blood glucose levels which led to an insulin drip for a period of time until he was titrated down to normal levels and then started on NPH insulin twice a day, 18 units subcu and then completed with a regular insulin sliding scale and when his NPH level should be titrated up or down depending on his fingersticks which are measured q 6 hours until he is stable.
The patient's left subclavian has no complications and can be removed after the final dose of his Ceftazidime on [**7-28**].
so that his INR will be between 2 and 3.
