GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Peak gradients 27-19 mm Hg, mean 4 mm Hg.
Remaining exam is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: He was taken to the operating room on [**2136-9-24**] where he underwent an AVR with #21 ON-X mechanical valve.
On POD 7 his INR was 2.1 and he was discharged home, to f/u w/Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks.
His INR and Coumadin dosing are to be followed by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 75950**].
3)  Report any weight gain of 2 pounds in 24 hours or 5 pounds in 1 week.
8) Coumadin for mechanical aortic valve - Check INR [**10-3**] results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 75950**]@ [**Numeric Identifier 75951**].
GOal INR 2.5-3.
