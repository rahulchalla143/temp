[**2147-1-19**] Abdominal X-Ray (KUB): Large amounts of free air in the abdomen.
The examination was performed in the upright and supine position.
MICROBIOLOGY: [**2147-1-17**] HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Final [**2147-1-18**]): NEGATIVE BY EIA.
Upon arrival in the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department, the patient's VS were T 95.4 oral, HR 70, BP 146/48, RR 18, SaO2 99%2LNC.
Also, her HCT was 28 from a baseline in the mid-30s.
CXR showed no focal consolidation.
Her first set of cardiac enzymes was negative.
Her VS prior to transfer were P 71, SaO2 98%RA, BP 128/47, RR 24, Afebrile.
On arrival to the floor, the patient's VS were T 98.2, BP 123/52, HR 78, RR 18, SaO2 100% on RA.
CXR showed tortuous aorta with no focal consolidation.
First set enzymes negative with lactate 1.7.
Hct went from low 30's baseline, to 27.8 at 12:50 pm to 20.0 at 8:30.
Gastroenterology was emergently consulted, and an EGD was performed which revealed a massive dark colored mass-like lesion near duodenal bulb; the stomach was clear.
A repeat EGD revealed 3 ulcers of the duodenal bulb.
Later, she underwent Angiogram which demonstrated no definite focus of active extravasation seen on SMA, celiac, and selective gastroduodenal artery (GDA) arteriograms.
A portable KUB was performed, which demonstrated large amounts of free air in the abdomen, potential additional moderate distension of small bowel loops, and gas markings in the bowel and rectum.
Lactate level was 0.9.
On [**2147-1-19**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions and [**Location (un) **] patch closure of perforated duodenal ulcer, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
CV: On POD#1, the patient experienced atrial fibrillation with RVR with a troponin bump to 0.14.
Previous transthoracic echocardiogram and PERSANTINE persantine stress tests were reviewed.
EF was 55%.
Once able to tolerate a diet, the patient was transtiotned back to her outpatient Atenolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control and other anti-hypertensives for BP control with good effect.
The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
After an upper GI study with barium swallow and small bowel follow through demonstrated no leak, the NG tube was discontinued and the patient started on sips of clears on POD#5.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Endocrine: As above, Endocrinology was consulted given the finding of a suppressed TSH of less than 0.02 in the context of atrial fibrillation.
Futher thyroid studies were evaluated.
There is not a need for surveillance CBC or LFT's as these reactions are acute.
A thyroid scan was ruled out given the patient recent high IV contrast burden to avoid renal impact.
The aptient will follow-up with Endocrine as an outpatient in 4 weeks, at which time repeat Thyroid functiontests will be performed.
The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay; sliding scale insulin was administered accordingly.
HCT prior to discharge was 26.9. .
