Initial electrocardiogram showed Q waves in inferior leads as well as V1 through V4 with ST elevation in leads V1 through V6.
CKs were measured and found to be around 1,400 with an index of 4 and a troponin of 10.6.
A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, akinesis of the septal, apical and inferior walls.
The cardiac catheterization showed two vessel coronary artery disease with a normal left main coronary artery, 100% occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery, which was stented, a 90% occlusion of the right coronary artery, which was stented, and a normal left circumflex artery.
A temporary pacemaker was also inserted and he was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for continuos hemodynamic monitoring of his cardiogenic shock.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission to the Coronary Care Unit, the patient had a temperature of 99, blood pressure 98/49, heart rate 90, ventricular paced, respiratory rate 30; ventilator settings, assist control, tidal volume 700, respiratory rate 22, PEEP 5, FiO2 60%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Endotracheal tube and gastrostomy tube in place, pupils dilated, neck supple.
Abdomen: Soft, obese, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Bilateral groin sites without oozing or hematoma, lower extremities mottled and toes cold with absent dorsalis pedis pulses by palpation or Doppler, with 1+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 20.2, hemoglobin 13.9, hematocrit 41, platelet count 151,000, sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 102, bicarbonate 12, BUN 38, creatinine 3.1, glucose 254, prothrombin time 22.6, partial thromboplastin time 124.1, INR 3.6, albumin 3.9, alkaline phosphatase 95, AST 428, ALT 106, total bilirubin 1.2, calcium 7.2, phosphorous 6.5 and magnesium 2.1.
Cardiac enzymes:  CK 2,387, CK/MB 151, index 6.3 and troponin greater than 50.
Chest x-ray confirmed proper endotracheal tube placement with mild pulmonary congestion, consistent with congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit status post cardiac catheterization around 9:00 p.m. on [**2177-8-8**].
Blood pressure was 98/49.
Dopamine was at 29.6 mg/kg/minute, Levophed 1.3 mg/minute and Neo-Synephrine 400 mcg/minute.
Levophed was increased from 1.3 to 4 to eventually 8 mg at around 6:00 a.m., at which time his blood pressure fell further to 71/49.
His urine output was initially 16 cc/hour which soon fell to 0 cc/hour despite optimization of blood pressure medications.
A family meeting was held in the early morning of [**2177-8-9**] and it was explained to the patient's two daughters that he did not seem to be improving post catheterization and recovery was very unlikely.
Blood pressure were withdrawn at 8:44 and the patient went into cardiac arrest.
