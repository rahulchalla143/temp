Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Recommendations: Patient will need repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy with argon-plasma coagulation to further treat radiation proctitis.
Pt underwent cath showing SVG-RCA 99%, SVG-OM1 proximal 80% & distal 90%.
Pt refused Lipitor 80mg, but was agreeable to 20mg QD.
A colonscopy revealed radiation proctitis, and coagulation was performed.
Pt was transfused to maintain a hematocrit > 30.
