[**2198-9-25**] 06:35AM BLOOD ALT-14 AST-23 LD(LDH)-203 AlkPhos-169* Amylase-60 TotBili-1.0  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was seen by neurosurgery and trauma surgery and admitted to the trauma ICU.
A head MRI/MRA was obtained which showed a normal circle of [**Location (un) 431**] with no aneurysm.
A repeat head CT showed no change in frontal hemorrhage pattern.
The patient was seen by cardiology and an EP study and echocardiogram was recommended, as the syncopal episode could have resulted from a pause, a tachyarrhythmia, or low cardiac output.
He was treated with anzemet, and due to possibility of progression of SAH, a head CT was obtained, which demonstrated that the small left medial frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage is much less prominent, compared to [**2198-9-22**], and there was no other interval change.
The patient will require a follow up head CT in approximately 6 weeks and an appointment with neurosurgery, and if the bleed is stable, then it may be possible to resume anticoagulation.
may consider elective cardiac catheterization in the future to potentially improve cardiomyopathy (EF=30%) with stenting or bypass.

You will need to contact your PCP and be referred to a neurosurgeon and also set up for CT of the head.
