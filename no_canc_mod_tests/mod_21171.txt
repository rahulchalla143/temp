All blood cultures were negative to date.
Stool viral culture also pending.
Urine culture with mixed flora.
HSV 2, serum IgG positive, PCR negative.
Apgars were 7 at 1 minute and 7 at 5 minutes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Birth weight 1690 grams, 90th percentile; length 43.5 cm, 90th percentile; head circumference 38 cm, 75 to 90th percentile.
From day of life 19 to day of life 49, the infant was on and off nasal cannula but has been on room air since day of life 49 with respiratory rate 30s to 50s and oxygen saturations greater than 94 percent.
Last apnea/ bradycardia was on [**1-10**].
The infant developed a murmur on day of life 1 and an echocardiogram showed a moderate sized patent ductus arteriosus.
He was treated with indomethacin and a repeat echocardiogram on day of life 5 showed a small patent ductus arteriosus and the infant was treated with a second course of indomethacin.
The infant has remained hemodynamically stable with heart rate of 130 to 160.
Mean blood pressures have been 46 to 60.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The infant was started on 80 cc per kg per day of D10W on admission.
The most recent electrolytes on [**12-23**] were sodium of 141, potassium 4.7, chloride 97, bicarb 33, calcium 10.9, phosphorous 6.8, alkaline phosphatase 202.
The most recent weight is 3860gm, head circumference 38 cm, length 53.5 cm.
Maximum bilirubin level was 10.0 with a direct of 0.3 on day of life 2.
Bilirubin level on day of life 12 was 4.6 with a direct of 0.6.
Due to continued desaturations with feedings, a feeding study and upper swallow study was performed at [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**1-10**] which was normal.
The most recent hematocrit on [**1-12**] was 27.4 percent with  reticulocyte count of 3.1 percent.
Blood cultures remained negative to date.
A lumbar puncture was also performed prior to antibiotics being started.
The spinal fluid culture remained negative and cerebrospinal fluid result showed a white blood cell count of 4, red blood cells 80, protein 103, glucose 30.
The PCR for HSV was negative and acyclovir was discontinued on day of life 5.
Surface cultures for HSV and enterovirus were also sent on admission which were negative.
A follow up head ultrasound on day of life 11 showed bilateral germinal matrix hemorrhages with intraventricular hemorrhages with mild to moderate lateral ventricular dilatation.
Head ultrasound on [**11-20**], day of life 19, showed severe bilateral ventricular dilatation with increased resistive indices.
At that time Neurology from [**Hospital3 1810**] was consulted and recommended serial lumbar punctures with follow up head ultrasounds.
Serial lumbar punctures started on [**11-21**] and his last lumbar puncture was on [**12-13**] with subsequent head ultrasound showing stable mild to moderate ventriculomegaly.
Daily head circumferences have been within normal range.
The most recent head ultrasound on [**1-15**] showed no change.
SENSORY:  Hearing screen was performed with automated auditory brain stem responses.
A follow up examination is recommended at 8 months of age and should be scheduled with Dr.[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
Hib [**1-5**], Prevnar [**1-6**], Synagis [**1-5**].
