EKG showed sinus rhythm and left bundle branch block, consistent with prior EKG.
CK-MB was elevated to 22.
Labs were notable for WBC 15.6 with 91.5% neutrophils, and creatinine 1.3, Troponin rose from 0.08 to 0.21.
BNP 7857.
CXR showed moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Vitals prior to transfer were: 71 136/54 21 97% on bipap 8/8.
Physical Exam: ON ADMISSION: VS: T=97.5 BP=139/64 HR=80 RR= 24 O2 sat= 96% BIPAP GENERAL: NAD.
RR, Loud S1, muffled S2, No m/r/g.
Diffuse wheeze, reduced air entry bilateral lung bases, bronchial breath sounds in right lung.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS:  ECG [**2198-1-25**]:  Left bundle branch, unchanged since prior.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver enhances homogeneously and shows no focal lesions.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The appendix is visualized and is unremarkable (3B:134).
This should be followed up with a chest CT in [**7-3**] months if there are no risk factors for lung cancer or prior history of malignancy.
His chest xray showed continued interval progression of his lung pathology, with worsening multifocal infiltrates and probable development of ARDS.
