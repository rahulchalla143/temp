An abdominal/pelvic CT revealed a large pneumoperitoneum.
An x-ray was perfomed of both hands, which showed degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis, and possible changes consistent with psoriatic arthritis in the right index  finger, although this finding was uncertain.
In consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**], proceeded with CAT scan which demonstrated portal venous air, intra-abdominal fluid, dilated small bowel, concern for vascular compromise of small bowel, no frank extravasation of contrast.
Early on [**2151-10-18**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, resection of ileocolic anastomosis, [**Doctor Last Name **] ileostomy, transverse end-colostomy, and debridement of fascial edges for identified perforation ileocolic anastomosis, which went well (see Operative Note).
Anemic with a HCT of 22; given 2 units PRBCs, Albumin, and lasix.
POD#[**9-22**], NGT output continues to be high, tip in stomach; RSB 50 however still fluid avid, remained intubated.
Albumin 25% 12.5g [**Hospital1 **].
POD#[**11-24**], refused CXR this am.
POD#13/6, started on IV Daptomycin for VRE (ENTEROCOCCUS FAECIUM) from blood culture dated [**2151-10-20**].
She was given repletement for her ostomy output with IV Lactated Ringer's.
An x-ray of the left ankle demonstrated that the hardware is unchanged, and that there were no signs for complications.
Pain was well controlled on oral pain medications.
Ostomy output was repleted cc:cc with LR IV Q4Hours.
Her blood sugar was monitored closely and covered when indicated by an insulin sliding scale.
Ileostomy output started to decrease at approximately 1Liter per day.
Imodium PRN was started to maintain an ileosotmy output around the 1L/day volume.
The ileostomy output decreased and was approximately 600cc during the 24 hours on [**2151-10-29**], the day prior to discharge.

*Try to maintain ileostomy output between 1000mL to 1500mL per day.
*If Ileostomy output >1 liter, take 4mg of Imodium, repeat 2mg with each episode of loose stool.
