Pt was therefore admitted for further work-up of hypoxic respiratory distress, EKG changes, and consideration for surgical repair of her L hip fracture.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-12-21**] 6:54 PM Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion, superimposed on chronic, diffuse interstitial process which (according to previous reports) represents known idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
TEE (Complete) Done [**2167-12-22**] at 2:49:50 PM Emergency TEE performed in the operating room after cardiac arrest.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Emergency TTE performed in the OR demonstrated severe global free wall hypokinesis at the dilated right ventricular cavity.
Pt was returned to the MICU, during which time she was ultimately placed on four pressors (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, dobutamine, and vasopressin), as well as NS boluses for hemodynamic support, and increased FiO2 for respiratory support.
Given h/o pulmonary disease and cardiac disease, MICU team discussed with the patient about risks associated with surgical repair, specifically perioperative MI and difficult post-op extubation.
Prior cardiac catheterizations demonstrated LCx involvement, and given this constellation of data, pt was considered a high peri-operative risk for MI.
