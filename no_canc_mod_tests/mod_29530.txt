[**2189-1-8**] at 11:00 p.m., troponin was less than 0.3; [**2189-1-9**] one troponin less than 0.3, [**2189-1-10**] two troponins less than 0.3 and [**2189-1-11**], one troponin less than 0.3  Admission chest x-ray shows resolution of right upper lobe infiltrate consistent with [**2188-12-11**], right lower extremity opacity with increased confluence, small bilateral pleural effusions, left base atelectasis, indistinct pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild congestive heart failure; summary, pneumonia with superimposed congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram on admission was paced with a left bundle branch pattern; compared with old electrocardiogram, it was completely paced, however, by transfer to c-medicine, he was in atrial fibrillation.
He still had jugular venous distention to the angle of the mandible and still had crackles on lung exam and complained of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea four to five times on the night of [**2189-1-14**].
His numbers were a pulmonary artery pressure of 47/19, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16, mixed venous 62, CTP 9, cardiac output 5.8, SVR 1,000.
On [**2189-1-16**], the patient also had a transesophageal echocardiogram cardioversion and was shocked into normal sinus rhythm.
His Bumex was changed to PRN on [**2189-1-17**] and the Swan-Ganz was discontinued and his cordis was changed to a triple-lumen over a wire.
His weight decreased to 98.7 kilograms on [**2189-1-21**].
The patient's oxygen requirements improved to be 93% in room air.
Valvular disease:  The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2188-12-15**] prior to this admission, with left atrium moderately dilated, no thrombus, left ventricular function mildly depressed, +1 tricuspid regurgitation, +1 aortic regurgitation, +4 mitral regurgitation and a simple atheroma in the descending artery.
In workup for the mitral valve replacement, the patient had an ultrasound of the carotids on [**2189-1-20**]; impression was minimal left internal carotid artery plaque, no associated stenosis, study otherwise normal.
The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2189-1-22**]; left atrium was moderately dilated, right atrium mildly dilated, there was a catheter or pacing wire seen in the right atrium and/or right ventricle, left ventricular wall thickness was normal, left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated, overall left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed, no resting left ventricular outflow obstruction, right ventricular free wall hypertrophied, right ventricle mildly dilated, focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle, focal calcifications of the ascending aorta, 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation, left ventricular ejection fraction 30%, tricuspid gradient 50 mm of mercury, severe +4 mitral regurgitation, mild mitral annular calcification, mild thickening of mitral valve chordae, tips of papillary muscles were calcified, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension, no definitive vegetations seen but this is best concluded by a transesophageal echocardiogram.
For his atrial fibrillation, the patient was DC cardioverted with a transesophageal echocardiogram in the Coronary Care Unit.
The transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2189-1-16**] read left atrium mildly dilated, no contrast or thrombus seen in the body of left atrium, left atrial appendage or body of the right atrium, right atrial appendage; right atrium mildly dilated, intra-atrial septum normal, no atrial septal defect seen by 2D or color Doppler; left ventricular wall thickness and cavity normal; there was a simple atheroma in the aortic arch; descending aorta normal diameter, simple atheroma in descending thoracic aorta, 4+ mitral regurgitation, mitral regurgitation jet was eccentric; mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity with fused commissures and tethering of leaflet motion; no change in this study from [**2188-12-15**].
His last cardiac catheterization was [**2188-3-14**] which showed the saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one and left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery patent; coronary artery bypass grafting was done in [**2184**].
The last episode on [**2189-1-21**], the patient had CKs of 32 and 44, troponin 0.4 and less than 0.3.
Renal:  The patient, on [**2189-1-25**], had a creatinine of 2.
The blood cultures were drawn on [**2189-1-20**].
The patient spiked to 101.4, prompting a blood culture.
Clostridium difficile was checked on [**2189-1-21**] that was negative.
One set of blood cultures drawn on [**2189-1-22**] was negative.
An additional set was drawn on [**2189-1-26**], which was negative.
The patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram repeated on [**2189-1-27**]; no mass or thrombus seen in left atrium or left atrial appendage, no mass or thrombus seen in right atrium or right atrial appendage, no atrial septal defect, no mass or vegetation seen on aortic valve; mitral valve thickened but no mass or vegetation seen in mitral valve and there was no change in terms of the severity of the regurgitation.
