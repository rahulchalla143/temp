Her INR remained low, and since [**1-7**] she had been taking the double dose 3 nights per week.
At the OSH her INR was corrected with 2U FFP and a colonoscopy was performed [**2157-1-21**] which showed blood in entire colon with diverticulosis, active bleeding from diverticular opening treated with epinephrine and endoclip.
When she was given FFP prior to the colonoscopy she had a reaction, her entire face swelled up and she had difficulty breathing.
Her Hct fell after transfusion and she was transferred here for further evaluation and treatment of her unstable lower GI bleeding   Past Medical History: 1.
CHF EF 60-65%, nuclear test with small potential ischemia 3.
Family History: sister died of CAD, had DM2  Physical Exam: VS Temp 98.6, BP 105/54, Pulse 74, RR 17, O2 sat 98% on RA Gen A&O3, lying in bed, NAD HEENT: MM moist, OP clear, teeth absent on lower left.
reflexes 1+ throughout.
OSH CT Abd: No retroperitoneal hemorrhage, sigmoid diverticulosis.
Prior to transfer to our institution, her coumadin had been stopped and she had been given Vitamin K and 2U FFP to reverse her INR, however she continued to have active bleeding, was given 3U PRBCs, and was transferred here for further evaluation and possible surgical intervention.
After stabilization in the MICU, she had no futher episodes of bleeding, and following the transfusion of 2 additional units of PRBC, her HCT was 29 and slowly trended upward to 33.5 over the next 3 days.
Repeat colonoscopy revealed several diverticuli in the distal colon/sigmoid region, consistent with the previous report, but none were actively bleeding and no interventions were undertaken.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation during the admission with several episodes of rapid ventricular response with heart rate elevations to the 140's.
