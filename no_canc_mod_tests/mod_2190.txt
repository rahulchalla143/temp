[**2127-9-19**] CSF Cryptococcal Antigen: Negative [**2127-9-19**] CSF Cx: No Growth  .
EKG [**2127-9-17**]:  Probable sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature beat.
Since the previous tracing of [**2127-6-7**] the rate is faster and ventricular ectopy is seen.
CT head [**2127-9-17**]:  FINDINGS: This study is limited by motion, which persisted on three attempts at acquiring study.
Bifrontal CSF spaces remained prominent, consistent due to frontotemporal predominant parenchymal atrophy.
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to patient motion.
CXR [**2127-9-17**]:  FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
There is a left subclavian dialysis catheter in place, which is unchanged from prior exam with tip in the expected location of the superior vena cava.
There is sclerosis at the fracture site with increased osseous bridging since the prior study from [**2127-8-18**].
He had a workup consisting of CT head, EKG, troponins, CXR, UA with UCx's and blood cx's, all which were negative for any new acute pathology.
Electrolytes at baseline were within normal limits and the patient did not have a fever.
Patient scheduled for head CT angio, neck CT for possible pharyngeal abscess, and IR guided LP for r/o meningitis.
Stat CXR showed worsening consolidation, especially in the patient's right lung.
CT angio and neck CT were never pursued.
Continued to trend platelets which remained stable.
Last HD session [**2127-9-26**].
Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) 100 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
While in the hospital, we checked for a stroke, new infection, and meningitis, which were all negative.
