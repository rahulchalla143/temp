l-s neg, CT abd w/o contrast showed no kidney stones.
MR revealed no epidural abscess and CT abdomen revealed small right psoas phlegmon.

Comparison with previous radiographs might be helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.
Focal area of inflammation/infection is suspected at the right psoas muscle at L1 level for which further evaluation with abdominal CT is recommended if clinically indicated.
[**4-30**] CT chest: 1) Diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs with septal thickening, likely due to hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
However, if clinical suspicion for pulmonary infection persists, short-term followup CT [**Known firstname **] be helpful to exclude active infection.
There is no CT evidence of osteomyelitis.
[**5-2**] Transesophageal ECHO - Conclusions: The left atrium is dilated.
Poor LAA and RAA  ejection velocities with spontaneous echo contrast in both atria.
[**5-2**] MRI L spine - Please note that today's examination has axial images which span the thoracolumbar junction and extend from roughly T10 through L4.
Compared to the previous examinations, there has been the development of numerous ring-enhancing masses in both psoas muscles and in the paraaortic retroperitoneal space of the lower thoracic region.
[**5-3**] CT guided aspiration - 1.
Psoas abscess aspiration was not attempted due to poor visualization by contrast-enhanced CT scan.
[**5-4**] CTA Torso - 1.
[**5-8**] MRI T/L Spine Compared to the prior exam, there has been progressive infection.

Microbio: [**2115-4-27**] - Urine cx no growth [**2115-4-27**] - [**4-30**] blood culture bottles grew MSSA [**2115-4-29**] - [**4-30**] blood culture bottles grew MSSA [**4-28**], [**4-30**], [**5-1**], [**5-2**], [**5-5**], [**5-6**] - blood cultures .
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for MRI of spine which ruled out epidural abscess and osteomyelitis, however it showed inflammation of the right psoas muscle.
Follow up abdominal CT scan showed a small right psoas plegmon.
Blood cultures from [**2115-4-27**] returned with 4/4 bottles with MSSA.
Surveillance cultures from [**2115-4-29**] also grew [**4-30**] GPC in clusters.
CT chest showed no evidence of other infectious foci, but did show possible increase in size of right psaos phlegmon and prevertebral soft tissue density.
Repeat MRI of L-spine with gadolinium showed worsening of the abscesses.
General surgery was consulted and felt that CT guided drainage would be the best method for draining the abscesses.
The patient had a CT guided aspiration on [**2115-5-4**] of 5 cc of pus which grew MSSA.
CT torso showed no PE or aortic dissection, but did demonstrate retrocrural hematoma at site of drainage.
Pt had a repeat T/L spine MRI which showed T12/L1 discitis.
Patient was discharged on oxacillin, will need at least [**7-4**] week course and management will be decided by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of ID at the appointment on [**5-29**], depending on results of MRI on [**5-27**].
# SOB:  On arrival to the medicine floor the patient was tachypneic, ABG showed mild alveolar hypoventilation with 7.38/48/106 on 2L 02 NC.
CXR did not show pneumonia, but CT showed bilateral moderate sized pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema.
The day after her CT guided drainage at which time she had required 5 units of FFP to reverse her INR, she developed increased difficulty breathing, serum bicarb noted to be 42.
ABG 7.31/91/112.
However after minimal diuresis her sodium continued to decrease, urine osm were elevated, FeNa was 0.13.
She was started on NS at 200cc/hr and her Na improved from 118 to 120 but then remained at 120.
Repeat FeNa was again consistent with prerenal state despite ~2L hydration with NS.
Patient was fluid restricted for possible SIADH from either pain, infection, or pleural effusions and her sodium improved to 127.
Patient was discharged on coumadin 2.5 mg po qd, goal inr [**3-1**].
Coumadin was re-started [**5-10**], INR > 2 on [**5-14**] and [**5-15**], please recheck daily inr for next few days and outpt follow-up in early [**Month (only) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] of cardiology.
Will likely need repeat UA and if still hematuria then cystoscopy as outpatient for further work up.

You are scheduled to have a follow up MRI at [**Hospital1 **] on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] in the basement of the clinical center on Monday [**5-27**] at 8pm.
The rehab facility will need to draw your blood once a week to check CBC, LFTs, BUN, creatinine and will fax these results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**].
