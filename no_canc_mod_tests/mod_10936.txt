Subsequent to this, he had a recurrence of his anginal symptoms in [**2152-9-6**], therefore prompting another cardiac catheterization which showed a re-narrowing of the similar left anterior descending lesion and consequently underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, brachytherapy, and cutting balloon.
After completing that, the patient was chest pain-free until approximately one week prior to this admission, when he began with the crescendo anginal symptoms, chest pain and shortness of breath that prompted him to be admitted on [**2153-1-19**], where he underwent cardiac catheterization showing a right dominant circulation system with a 70% left anterior descending lesion with 90% distal disease past the site of the stent.
His preoperative laboratories were notable for a hematocrit of 26, BUN and creatinine of 19 and .9.
The patient's pericardium was left open.
He was brought to the Cardiac Surgical Recovery Unit, where his drips were weaned to amiodarone .5, milrinone .6, and Neo-Synephrine .5 to maintain cardiovascular parameters of 83 and sinus, blood pressure of 99/40 after two units transfused, as well as shovel mask at 100% for the arterial blood gas of 7.34/46/113/26/-1.
His lactate was 3.8, down from 4.8 postoperatively.
His hematocrit was 26.6 after transfusion of two units for a hematocrit of 21.
Preoperative hematocrit was 30.
BUN and creatinine were 19 and .9.
They ultimately revealed a value of greater than 60, and therefore no  more blood transfusion was carried out.
Lasix and Lopressor were held for blood pressure issues.
His chest tubes remained for high outputs on postoperative day number one.
His hematocrit was 23.
His BUN and creatinine were 19 and .7 on day number two, and he was continuing on oral amiodarone.
He was given a physical therapy and rehabilitation screening, which ultimately revealed that he was ambulator and independent enough to warrant discharge to home.
His hematocrit was 24, his BUN and creatinine were 20 and .9 respectively on postoperative day three.
His chest tubes, Foley and wires were all removed.
His continued aggressive pulmonary toilet and, by postoperative day number five, he was at a Level V, tolerating a full diet, with a hematocrit of 25, BUN and creatinine of 22 and 1.0.
His vital signs were 99.2 for a T-max, 75 and sinus rhythm, 100/59 for blood pressure.
