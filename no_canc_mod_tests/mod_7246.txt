PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.9 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 83, blood pressure 182/86, respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 100 percent on room air.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Distal pulses were two plus and he had no peripheral edema in both lower extremities and slight peripheral edema in his left upper extremity at the site of where he had a prior fistula for hemodialysis.
The patient was also followed by the Renal Transplant Service who also noted his creatinine to reveal excellent graft function.
The patient's vital signs were stable during this time.
Vital signs were taken revealing a blood pressure of 204/109 with a heart rate of 144, breathing at 70 percent on room air.
Blood pressure at this point was 208/111, heart rate 137.
Blood gases were drawn.
Electrolytes and blood cultures were sent and Foley catheter was inserted.
A second dose of intravenous Lopressor was given and his blood pressure was 206/90 at this point, heart rate of 137 and at this point 10 mg of intravenous Lopressor was hung and 10 mg was pushed.
Chest x-ray revealed what looked like a likely pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.
His blood gases at this point were pO2 of 82, pCO2 of 54 and a pH of 7.19.
On SICU day two, the patient was noted to be significantly improved and vital signs were within normal limits.
His blood pressure was 161/82 at this point and he was saturating at 95 percent on room air with a heart rate of 83.
His vital signs were stable.
The patient was saturating well and his heart rate and blood pressure were within normal limits.
Blood pressure at this point was 115/68.
On the 17th day of [**Month (only) 30676**] hospital day nine, the patient continued to progress well and the patient was scheduled for stress echocardiogram as preoperative evaluation after events that led to the patient being transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
Echocardiogram revealed moderate inferior wall hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of approximately 27-28 percent and it was determined at this point that the patient would likely benefit from cardiac catheterization.
The patient, however, required two negative sets of blood cultures which were drawn on the 16th and [**7-3**] which eventually came back negative and the patient was brought to cardiac catheterization on [**7-9**] revealing that the patient had normal coronary arteries.
The rest of his vital signs were within normal limits.
if patient had any increasing fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, decreased urine output, excessive blood coming from site of wound VAC or if there were any other questions.
