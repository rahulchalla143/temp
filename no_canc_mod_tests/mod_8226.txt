HEAD AND NECK MRI [**9-6**] FINDINGS:  There is slow diffusion within the entire right middle cerebral artery territory, compatible with acute/subacute ischemia.

No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 1 iv injection of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline at rest.
Echo contrast was administered by the clinical nurse.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-8-1**], the findings are similar.
CT Head [**9-7**]: FINDINGS:  The patient's head is turned to the right at approximately 45 degrees, making evaluation slightly difficult.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt is a 76 yo M with history of pAfib on Coumadin, off Coumadin for 5 days as he was planned to undergo cardiac catheterization because of recent worsening of his cardiac function and CHF (EF 10-15%) who was transported to the hospital after his wife found him lethargic, non-communicative and with left side weakness.
He was found on CTA and CT perfusion to have thromboembolic occlusion of [**Country **]-RMCA c/b ischemia in the RMCA distribution.
His limited neurological exam demonstrated R hemiparesis (arm>leg), left sided neglect and forced eye deviation towards the right.
Ischemic stroke: An MRI was performed and confirmed acute infarct in the entire right MCA territory and large thrombus in the right carotid extending from the distal cervical portion, through the bifurcation of the internal carotid and into the right MCA.
Stroke risk factors: A1c (5.2), lipid profile (TChol 138, LDL 83, HDL 43, TG 60).
Cardiovascular: hx of CHF: In ICU, cardiology service got involved and recommended preventing volume overload, started betablocker drip for heart rate control and will perform TTE.
