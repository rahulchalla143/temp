[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
LV systolic function is slightly improved.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2196-4-27**] 9:14 AM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: evaluate for ptx  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old man with s/p mv repair REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate for ptx HISTORY: Previous pneumothorax, to evaluate for persistence.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-26**], there is no longer any convincing evidence of pneumothorax.
A head CT was obtained, as was a neurology consult.
The CT revealed a right frontal and left parietal stroke.
A limited carotid u/s showed 80-99% stenosis so a vascular consult was obtained.
Repeat full carotid u/s on [**4-27**] showed bilateral 70-79% stenosis.
He will need a CTA and follow up with vascular surgery.
