CT Head: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo W with no significant PMH presents with hypertensive emergency and acute pulmonary edema  CV/HTN: - Pt initially had evidence of cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema on physical exam and cxr as well as LVH on EKG.
Cr was elevated at 1.1-1.3.
TTE showed moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild mitral regurgitation, elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
Pt's BP was initially controlled on labetolol drip and switched to PO labetolol.
Workup for causes of secondary hypertension, including MRI/MRA abdomen (preliminarily negative for RAS, Pheo, other tumors), plasma metanephrines and renin/[**Male First Name (un) 2083**] levels was negative or pending at time of discharge.
Urine studies showed Urine protein of 18, CR of 60 for an elevated Up/cr ratio of .3.
Physical exam was negative for any cerebellar, vestibular or proprioceptive signs.
CT head showed white matter hypodensities and prominent venous plexus in the pterygoid muscle, and follow up MRI showed no infarct, moderate small vessel disease, and no signs of hypertensive encephalopathy; MRA normal.
The high blood pressure is unclear in etiology.
Labetolol: a beta blocker that lowers your blood pressure and heart rate.
Please check your blood pressure at that time also.
