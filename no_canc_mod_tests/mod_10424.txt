She was on her way from [**State 760**] to [**State 350**] and her husband noted she was unable to speak at all.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission vital signs were normal, temperature 98.9, blood pressure 208/65.
Strength exam had mild left sided drift.
The remainder of her strength exam was [**4-16**]+ bilateral upper and lower extremities.
Sensory exam was limited due to language difficulty, however, she did withdraw to pain bilaterally.
She had an MRI from [**2180-4-12**] which showed multiple white matter lesions in the entire brain and brain stem.
MRI showed multiple distal stenoses of vessels.
Repeat MRI on admission from [**2180-11-26**] with and without contrast showed a left frontoparietal area of white matter edema with enhancement that does not have the characteristic appearance of an infarct and suspicious for neoplasm.
Opening pressure was 25, white cells 4, red cells 0, polys 72, lymphs 16, monos 12, protein 57, glucose 50.
An EEG was done somewhat later in the hospital admission after she was more stable.
This EEG showed abnormal EEG due to the slow background with additional bursts of generalized slowing which suggested dysfunction of deep midline structures as can be seen with moderate to midline encephalopathy.
The results of this exam were inconclusive.
Biopsy was performed on [**12-1**] without complications.
She was also started on hydralazine at that time and her blood pressure continued to come down well.
After the biopsy was finished, we started an IV steroid course of 1000 mg q.day of Solu-Medrol.
She is to have speech and swallow evaluations as an outpatient in rehab and she needs a video swallow within one week to further assess her swallowing and aspiration risk.
Blood pressure at the time was 80/40 and she lost consciousness for a few seconds.
They decided to prep her for colonoscopy on the next day and decided to watch her hematocrit very closely q.12 hours.
Her hematocrit always remained stable.
We then ordered a stat CT scan of the abdomen with contrast.
These findings were discussed with GI and we continued her on q.12 hour hematocrit checks which continued to be stable.
Her most recent hematocrit was 29.9 with MCV of 61.
At that point we sent off iron studies which are pending at this time.
We continued to maintain adequate hydration and are still waiting for final biopsy results from the sigmoidoscopy.
b.i.d., hold for SBP less than 110.
q.day, hold for SBP less than 110.
q.six, hold for SBP less than 110.
Will need speech evaluation at rehab as well as video swallow within a week.
