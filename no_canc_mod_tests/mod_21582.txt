CXR [**4-18**]:  The heart is normal in size.
CXR [**4-23**]:  PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There are developing bibasilar areas of consolidation.
Follow-up study after clinical treatment is recommended to demonstrate complete resolution.
CT chest [**4-25**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
Atrophic liver, splenomegaly, ascites and lateral collateral vessels in this patient with end-stage liver disease.
CXR [**4-30**]:  IMPRESSION: Marked improvement in bilateral lower lobe consolidations with only faint residual reticular opacity seen in these regions.
Improved congestive failure compared to the most recent study of [**2166-4-27**].
An abdominal U/S on admission showed good portal and hepatic vein flow without clot, but severe ascites.
An MRI revealed patent vessels.
His MELD dropped precipitously once one week out from CVVHD, and he was able to be discharged from the hospital.
He will get labs drawn 3 days after discharge, and will call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for an appointment.
2) Acute renal failure:  On admission he was noted to have a marked increase in creatinine from a baseline of 1.2 to 2.7.
Initially it was thought to be pre-renal from his liver disease and aggressive outpatient diuresis, however his creatinine did not improve with holding diuretics and giving albumin.
Urine lytes were not reliable in the setting of polyuria.
His creatinine had actually begun to improve prior to transfer to the SICU, down to 2.2, however it was slow and his edema was increasing, therefore he was transfered to the SICU for CVVHD and diuresis.
However, he became progressively hypoxic, to the point where he required up to 2 L to keep his oxygen saturation above 90%, and a repeat CXR suggested bibasilar infiltrates.
He completed 10 days of vanco/zosyn, as well as azithromycin for atypical coverage, and his oxygenation improved to baseline (98% on RA).
At one point his hematocrit dropped from 33 to 28, and he did report some hematochezia, so a decision was made to scope.
An EGD showed possibly a small esophageal varix, and portal hypertensive gastropathy.
A colonoscopy showed internal hemorrhoids.
His anemia is an anemia of chronic inflammation.
