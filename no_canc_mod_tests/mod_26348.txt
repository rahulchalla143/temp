Known [**Location (un) 5621**] fractures at C1 and anterior distraction at C6-C7 with associated soft tissue abnormality, as previously characterized on dedicated cervical spine CT.  CT(Head): [**9-3**] IMPRESSION: New extensive, virtually holocerebellar infarction with associated severe cytotoxic edema extending into the cerebellar peduncles and dorsal brainstem.
These findings are all new since the study performed the evening before.
CT C-Spine([**9-2**]): FINDINGS: There is underlying ankylosing spondylitis.
MRI C-Spine ([**9-2**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT (Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis): [**9-2**] IMPRESSION: 1.
On arrival, his work up included a head CT that was unremarkable.
His C-spine CT revealed a C1 burst fracture as well as a C7 hyperflexion fracture.
His CTA revealed a possible right vertebral artery dissection and a hypotrophic left vertebral artery.
Anticoagulation was not initiated because the chest CT had revealed a mediastinal hematoma.
He was admitted to the ICU on [**9-2**] for further monitoring and management.
The patient's neurologic examination deteriorated subsequently.
A CT scan of his head was emergently obtained and revealed hydrocephalus.
While the surgery was uneventful, post operative CT and MRI scans revealed hyperintensity of the brain stem, suggestive of ischemia/infraction.
