Micro: Urine culture [**11-16**], [**11-17**] Negative Stool culture [**11-17**] negative Blood cultures: 10/12 [**2-6**] + Strep Pneumo sensitive to ceftriaxone, all others negative or NGTD .
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size with a mild left ventricular configuration.
Blood cultures, [**2-8**], returned positive for strep pneumoniae sensitive to ceftriaxone.
It was also noted that the patient had a small right apical pneumothorax on CXR noted on [**11-22**] amenable to monitoring.
Follow up CXR showed marked improvement in the size on [**11-23**].
She will need follow up CXR in [**6-9**] days to assess for resolution    The day prior to discharge, the patient's white count showed a mild elevation.
A UA and urine culture were sent to ensure no urinary tract infection was the cause.
The urine was negative for UTI.
Blood cultures were NGTD.
# UTI: The patient had no urinary complaints, but the UA was positive for a UTI and her urine culture grew E-Coli, sensitive to ceftriaxone.
# ARF: Initially, the patient's renal function was impaired with a slight elevation in her creatinine level, which was up from baseline.
These levels resolved with some fluid boluses and remained steady throughout her stay.
But once the patient's vital signs stabilized and the her clinical illness began to improve, gentle diuresis was attempted to help with her respiratory status.
Ceftriaxone-Dextrose (Iso-osm) 1 g/50 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1)  Intravenous  Q24H (every 24 hours) for 3 days: [**11-28**] last dose.
Will need follow up Chest X-Ray to re-assess for resolution of infectious processes/pneumothorax
