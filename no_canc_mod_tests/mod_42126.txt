Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and extensive apical akinesis with focal dyskinesis.
ECHO ([**2138-6-5**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and extensive severe apical hypokinesis/akinesis with focal apical dyskinesis.
ECHO ([**2138-6-7**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
ECHO ([**2138-6-11**]) IMPRESSION: Regional wall motion abnormalities as described above.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-6-5**], the left ventricular cavity size has increased (suggestive of inferolateral aneurysm development), there is now mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
CXR ([**2138-6-13**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is ongoing improvement of the pre-existing pulmonary edema.

# CORONARIES:  Per OSH report, 100% generic proximal LAD stenosis and 90% calcified proximal LAD stenosis, a 95% diffuse ostial ramus stenosis, 90% tubular proximal circumflex stenosis, 100% generic ostial marginal 1 stenosis, 100% generic mid and marginal 2 stenosis, 100% thrombus lesion of the mid RCA, 70% diffuse lesion of the mid RCA, and a 50% discrete mid right PDA lesion.
CK: 8973  MB: >500  Trop-T: 13.88 on admission (also dramatically elevated at OSH).
Cardiac enzymes  trended down.
HRs elevated in the 100s, increased metoprolol 25mg PO bid.
Cardiac medication regimen adjusted to include prasugrel 10mg [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325, warfarin 4mg qd, atorvastatin 80mg qd, metoprolol succinate 25mg daily, lisinopril 10mg daily, eplerenone 25mg daily, lasix 40 mg qd PO.
Of note, the patient's warfarin dose was increased from 2 to 4mg per day, because the patient's INR decreased to 1.9 on [**2138-6-14**].
Please track INR (next check on [**5-17**]), and adjust coumadin dose for a goal INR of [**2-21**], for prevention of LV thrombus.
Patient continued to be volume overloaded, based upon CXR and physical exam.
TTE on [**6-11**] showed mild to moderate MR due to leaflet tethering, thus lisinopril was increased from 5mg to 10mg daily to reduce afterload.
Blood cultures, urine cultures were negative.
No clear focal consolidation on initial CXR (although marked pulm edema).
Repeat CXR s/p diuresis still did not show VAP.
Repeat cultures were drawn and showed NGTD at the time of discharge.
Sputum culture grew yeast but this was likely related to his oral thrush.
Repeat CXR showed focal RLL consolidation but this was felt to likely be post-extubation aspiration pneumonitis as his fever curve and WBC trended down.
He completed 8 day course of abx with no recurrence of fevers or WBC count after course.
Pt will need repeat echo, in approximately 5 weeks from discharge, to assess global cardiac function.
Patient should have every other day INR checked at rehab, with coumadin adjusted accordingly, for a goal INR of [**2-21**] for prevention of LV thrombus.
