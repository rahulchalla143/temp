Upon arrival to the ED at 0245 vitals were: T 97.4, HR 110, BP 147/74, RR 20, O2Sat 97% 2L.
Head CT and c-spine CT limited by motion, but without any obvious abnormalities.
Repeat CXR was read as ED staff as possibly being consistent with aspiration.
Patient's ABG at 0900 was 7.21/65/136, concerning for respiratory acidosis.
Vitals prior to transfer to the MICU were: HR 105, BP 131/70, RR 17, O2Sat 100% NRB.

This examination is suboptimal due to patient motion; three acquisitions were attempted, with the third, more satisfactory.
CT C-SPINE [**2162-2-24**]: FINDINGS: No comparison studies available.
Evaluation of finer cortical detail of the cervical spine is limited due to excessive patient-related motion (with no repeat acquisition attempted).
Suboptimal study due to patient motion; however, no fracture or traumatic malalignment of the cervical spine is seen.
Ground-glass opacities at the lung apices may be secondary to hypoinflation; however, further evaluation with chest radiography is recommended.
CXR PORTABLE AP [**2162-2-24**]: No comparison studies available.
IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited examination due to patient positioning, however no acute intrathoracic process seen.
CXR PORTABLE AP [**2162-2-24**]: FINDINGS: Compared to most recent prior, lung volumes are lower.
He was repositioned in bed to minimize snoring/apnea and oxygen saturations rapidly improved.
# ETHANOL INTOXICATION/SEDATION: With the exception of blood alcohol level of 352 two hours after arrival to ED, remainder of urine and serum tox screens were negative.
There was no significant hematoma or soft tissue swelling and CT of head and C-spine did not show evidence of bleed or fracture.
He had no clinical evidence of C-spine injury and given the negative findings on CT (albeit in the setting of study limited by motion artifact), cervical collar was removed prior to discharge.
