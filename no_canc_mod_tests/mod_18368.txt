TTE negative for vegetations and blood culture with no growth at the time of transfer.
CXR with no clear consolidation and he was scheduled to undergo a TEE to rule out endocarditis but the patient started withdrawing right before the procedure.
CT scan demonstrated poor definition of perimesencephalic cisterns without asymmetry which was concerning for some increased intracranial pressure.
CXR did not reveal a clear consolidation and he had elevated A-a gradient so he underwent a CTA which did not reveal a PE.
A CTA was negative for PE.

An stat head CT/CTA was obtained that showed SAH and likely PCA aneurysm.
