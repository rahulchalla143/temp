LP at the outside hospital was notable for a white blood cell count of [**2127**].
Renal:  The patient was noted to have a baseline creatinine of approximately 0.8-0.9 and increase in her creatinine from 0.9 to 1.5 was noted.
She had a renal ultrasound performed which showed both kidneys measuring 12 cm.
The patient had a renal workup which was notable for negative urinalysis and no evidence of infection, after the increase in the white blood cell count.
There are no appreciable eosinophils and spun urine sediment was negative for casts.
The patient's renal electrolytes on [**10-18**] revealed a urine sodium of less than 1 and urine creatinine of 30.
The patient, during this hospitalization, was encouraged to drink fluids and she also received some IV fluids, given an initial urine sodium of less than 1 suggesting a prerenal component of the renal function.
Hematology:  During this [**Hospital 228**] hospital admission, she had an admission hematocrit of 32.2 on [**10-8**] with a steady drop in hematocrit to 22.8 on [**10-24**].
The patient was seen by the Hematology services during this admission for evaluation of her anemia.
Iron studies sent on [**10-20**] revealed a decreased TIBC of 217, increased ferritin of 368, and iron levels of 55.
Hemolysis laboratories were also sent which had normal bilirubin and normal LDH.
The patient had a reticulocyte count performed on [**10-20**] which was 3% and a repeat reticulocyte count on [**10-24**] which was 1.5%.
The patient's isolated falling hematocrit with a low reticulocyte count is suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
Iron studies also suggested anemia of chronic disease, as well.
It was also felt that gradual increase in hematocrit drop may also be due in part to daily phlebotomy labs in the setting of decreased production of red cells.
The patient had a lumbar puncture performed under fluoroscopy on [**10-21**].
The lumbar puncture showed there is one white cell with 99% red blood cells and, in tube #4, there were 0 white blood cells with [**Pager number **] red blood cells.
Protein was 68, glucose 68.
No PMN's on gram stain and there was no growth from the CSF cultures.
The patient also had repeat blood cultures drawn and the patient's catheter tip from the central line was sent.
These cultures had no growth to date.
A repeat MRI for evaluation of the left psoas abscess revealed a left psoas abscess at approximately L4-L5 which does not appear to be as extensive in volume compared to the previous examination from [**2129-10-12**].
At that time, a repeat MRI will be scheduled.
