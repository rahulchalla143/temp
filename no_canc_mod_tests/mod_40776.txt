His first vital signs were 93% O2 sat on NRB and HR 71.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vital signs were temp 96.5, HR 71, BP 164/90, RR 19, and pulse ox 98%.
Review of systems could not be obtained as patient is intubated and sedated.

- Echocardiogram [**2164-2-27**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-18**], direct comparison is difficult as both studies are suboptimal.
Overall LV systolic function is probably similar.
Urine and blood cultures were sent and had no growth at time of discharge.
Head CT was negative for acute process.
LENIS were obtained and showed no DVT.
PTX Patient's CXR had a questionable PTX after intubation.
Further CXRs showed no evidence of PTX.
After receiving fluids he did have increased pulmonary congestion on a CXR and decreased O2 sats so received some diuresis with 20mg IV lasix.
The TTE showed new wall motion abnormalities of RV consistent with prior ETT that showed reversible inferior wall ischemia.
Severe AS: Patient had TTE showing severe AS (valve area 0.7) worse than prior TTE dated [**2160**].
CRI: Patient had creatinines 1.3->2 in OMR.
With diuresis for respiratory status, creatinine increased to 2.2.
Communication:  Patient, Son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92955**](home), cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92956**]   Medications on Admission: 1.
Citalopram 10mg PO daily 3.
MVI 1 tab daily 8.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day).
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw INR 2 days after discharge and fax results to rehab physician for dosing of coumadin.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw creatinine 1 day after discharge and fax to rehab physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] losartan if creatinine >2.2.
You had an ultrasound of your heart that shows that it is not beating as well as it should and that one of the valves is not opening enough.
