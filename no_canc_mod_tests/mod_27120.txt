TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis with multiplanar reformatted images.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an ET tube, with the tip positioned within the right main stem bronchus.
The sidehole of the right chest tube is not positioned within the hemithorax, and is positioned in the adjacent subcutaneous tissues.
Lung window images demonstrate several scattered areas of ill-defined opacity within the right upper lobe, which likely represent areas of contusion.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and gallbladder are within normal limits.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A catheter is seen within the bladder.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology.
Further characterization with MRI or renal mass CT is recommended to exclude malignancy in a nonemergent basis.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2200-10-5**] no major change.

FINDINGS: The study is compared with the recent NECT of the head, dated [**2200-10-10**].
Fluid levels in the sphenoid sinuses, bilaterally, which, in this context with layering fluid in the posterior nasopharynx, may, in part, relate to supine positioning.
Very limited depiction of the brain with enlarged bifrontal extra-axial CSF space, unchanged since [**10-10**], but new since the [**10-3**] admission study.
Follow up imaging of her right shoulder revealed persistent dislocation; several closed reduction attempts have been made to relocate without success; she will require further follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after discharge.
Orthopedic spine surgery was consulted because of her spine injuries; she was taken to the operating room for fusion of C7 to T9; total laminectomy of T3; reduction of posterior fracture-dislocation; instrumentation of C7 to T9; and autograft.
A CT scan of her sinuses and mandible were performed because of unilateral facial swelling in order to rule out any sinus processes (see pertinent results section).
Her pain was initially controlled with IV narcotics; Morphine and Dilaudid; she did on occassion drop her blood pressure with IV Dilaudid; the dose was decreased.
She did have intermittent fevers and was cultured; her most recent workup was on [**10-16**]  WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2200-10-18**]): No significant growth.
The anaerobic and aerobic blood cultures are still pending at time of this dictation.
Prior to this her sputum culture results were as follows: [**2200-10-12**] 8:24 am SPUTUM     Site: ENDOTRACHEAL       Source: Endotracheal.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2200-10-15**]):       OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
