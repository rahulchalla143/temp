Name:  [**Known lastname 1264**],[**Known firstname **] L                    Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 1265**]  Admission Date:  [**2123-8-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-9-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2032-10-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfonamides / Xanax / Tetracyclines / Erythromycin / Tetanus Antitoxin / Morphine / Isosorbide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1266**] Addendum: Patient was observed overnight after additional studies were obtained per patient request.
She underwent ultrasound which was inconclusive for DVT given large pelvic hematoma (with blunted waveforms).
Recommendations by radiology included CT venogram to evaluate for DVT, if clinically indicated.
After extensive discussion with patient, her son and her daughter, this study was not pursued as she is not a candidate for anticoagulation (if DVT was present) given recurrent severe bleeding after valvuloplasty and patient would not pursue IVC filter if DVT was detected, given multiple catheterization related bleeding complications.
