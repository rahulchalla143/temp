His history is also significant for CHF exacerbation secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, an EF of less than 30% with 2+ mitral regurg.
EKG revealed an A-paced rhythm with left bundle branch pattern at a rate of 65.
QTC was 498 and was AV paced.
On the first set events, the cardiac troponin-T was 0.07 and the CK was 191.
Coronary artery disease, status post cardiac cath in [**2186**] and [**3-2**].
LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 10.6, hemoglobin 13.3, hematocrit 43, platelets 229.
PT 12.7, PTT 24.2, INR 1.1.
UA - straw colored, specific gravity 1.019, negative nitrites, negative leukocytes.
CK 191, cardiac troponin 0.07.
Cardiac echo from [**2201-7-27**] showed a mildly dilated LA, normal left ventricular wall thickness, mild decreased left ventricular function apically inferior, and inferolateral.
Cardiac cath results from [**2201-8-21**] - selective coronary angiography with a left dominant system revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right-sided filling pressures with a mean RA pressure of 25 mmHg and an RV-EDP of 44 mmHg.
Left-sided filling pressures were severely elevated with a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 mmHg.
In the CCU, the patient was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure to the 60s.
A Swan was then placed in the femoral vein.
His blood pressure medications were held until his blood pressure was controlled off dopamine.
3) CARDIAC PUMP:  A cardiac echo was obtained on the day of admission.
It was a limited study but revealed the left ventricular cavity size to be normal.
His creatinine was monitored throughout the hospitalization and trended down nicely following the cardiac cath.
