K 10mg and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]  On arrival her GCS was 14, her SBP was >210 and she was given nicardipine gtt as well as profilnine for rapid reversal of INR.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch b/l  Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right 2 2 2 1 0 Left  2 2 2 1 0  Toes upgoing bilaterally  Coordination: slow on finger-nose-finger on the right, slow [**Doctor First Name **] on right, heel to shin defered  Handedness: Right  Upon discharge: Awake, alert, minimal speech, at times follows simple commands, MAE.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**2102-3-12**] Dobbhoff tip is in the stomach, is not post-pyloric.
This examination was centered in the thoracoabdominal region.
MRI Brain [**2102-3-12**] IMPRESSION: Extensive early subacute right cerebellar hematoma with significant mass effect and distortion of the fourth ventricle but no evidence of acute hydrocephalus.
However, given the masking effect of T1 bright early subacute blood products, followup exam should be obtained sustantiate concern for underlying mass.
LENIS [**2102-3-13**] No DVT seen on bilateral lower extremities   CTA Pelvis/Abd [**2102-3-13**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT [**2102-3-14**] ReportIMPRESSION: Stable right cerebellar hemispheric hemorrhage with mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle with unchanged mild ventricular dilatation as well as unchanged mild right tonsillar herniation into the foramen magnum.
Repeat CT imaging was done on [**3-12**] and this was stable.
MRI was ordered to look for metastases with her history of breast CT. Neurology was consulted and they agreed with our current BP control and imaging plans.
She was continued on her home Dilantin and a level was drawn on [**3-12**] This was 7.9.
Patient's neurologic exam remained stable and was at her baseline per her family.
Because of her bleed, however, coumadin is contraindicated, so patient was given an IVC filter on [**3-13**].
After reviewing her MRI it was discuess that she could benefit from a craniotomy and evacuation of the hemorrhage, however, after discussion with the family, it was decided to postpone surgical intervention.
A head CT was stable.
** Stroke Neurology would like to see you again in about [**2-10**] months with an MRI brain to assess for an  underlying mass.
**  Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks with a head CT w/o contrast.
Please follow-up in the [**Hospital 878**] Clinic, Dr [**First Name (STitle) **], in [**2-10**] months with a MRI Brain with and without contrast to assess for an underlying mass.
