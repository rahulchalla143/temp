On arrival to the ED, CXR showed moderate CHF.
Diastolic dysfunction 2.
Chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine high 2s-low 3s 6.
Giardia ([**3-/2137**]) 9.
Physical Exam: Physical examination at the time of transfer from the ICU: VITALS: Tm 99.2/98.2, BP 110-140/50-60s, HR 60-70s, RR teens, Sat 96-100% on face mask 0.50.
Heart exam limited secondary to breath sounds.
Pertinent Results: Relevant laboratory data on admission: CBC [**2141-5-2**]: WBC-17.1*# RBC-3.43* HGB-9.8* HCT-29.1* MCV-85 MCH-28.6 MCHC-33.7 RDW-16.0* NEUTS-81* BANDS-3 LYMPHS-10* MONOS-6 EOS-0 BASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0  Chemistry: GLUCOSE-179* UREA N-39* CREAT-2.9* SODIUM-132* POTASSIUM-5.3* CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-19* ANION GAP-20 CALCIUM-8.9 PHOSPHATE-3.6 MAGNESIUM-1.4*  Coagulation: PT-13.9* PTT-24.8 INR(PT)-1.2*  Microbiology: [**2141-5-9**] URINE negative [**2141-5-4**] URINE CULTURE negative [**2141-5-2**] SPUTUM GRAM STAIN-FINAL; RESPIRATORY CULTURE-FINAL {MORAXELLA CATARRHALIS, PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION} INPATIENT [**2141-5-2**] URINE CULTURE negative [**2141-5-2**] BLOOD CULTURE negative  Other data: HbA1c and PTH pending.
Relevant imaging data: [**2141-5-2**] CXR: Moderate CHF [**2141-5-2**] CXR: NG tube, worsened CHF [**2141-5-2**] CXR: ETT, persistent pulmonary edema  ECHO [**2141-5-2**]: LV thickness normal.
Sputum gram stain returned positive for GN diplococci, and culture eventually grew Moraxella catarrhalis.
Please see below for further details on his CHF management.
CAD: His cardiac enzymes on admission were noted to be trending up, and an EKG was concerning for "pseudonormalization" of T waves in V3-6 versus 04/[**2140**].
It is of note that cardiac enzymes were not obtained in [**3-/2141**] in the setting of these changes.
An echo was obtained on [**2141-5-2**], which revealed new systolic dysfunction with EF 35%, with mid to distal septal and apical akinesis.
Review of his records indicated a recent echo with preserved systolic function in 03/[**2140**].
His troponin continued to rise in the ICU, but CK was trending down.
His sodium and creatinine will need to be closely monitored as an out-patient.
GI bleed: While in the hospital, he was noted to have guaiac positive stools, associated with a hematocrit drop to 24 on [**2141-5-2**] (albeit also in the setting of a short course of IV heparin).
His hematocrit remained stable thereafter, and further work-up was not pursued.
A recent renal U/S in [**2-/2141**] was remarkable for thin cortices suggestive of parenchymal disease.
Prior lab data were also remarkable for known nephrotic range proteinuria, negative SPEP/UPEP in [**2139**].
PTH pending at the time of discharge.
5) Hyponatremia: On [**2141-5-7**], his sodium was noted to drop to 127.
His Lasix was held for 48 hours, with eventual improvement in his sodium to 131.
Urine lytes revealed UNa 25, Uosm 371, Uurea 646.
A repeat U/A was negative, and a repeat CXR showed only RLL atelectasis without clear infiltrate.
His WBC was back down to normal on [**2141-5-10**].
He will need further work-up as an out-patient.
Discharge Instructions: Please weigh yourself every morning, and [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
You will need close follow-up of your blood work as an out-patient.
