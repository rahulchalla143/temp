CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION REPORT [**2159-10-11**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Selective coronary angiography of the LMCA demonstrated 70% distal LMCA stenosis, 100% proximally occluded LAD, 70% ostial LCX stenosis with 80% stenosis in the AV groove branch.
The systemic arterial pressures were normal measured 110/56mmHg.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
Patient participated in Champion PCI study involving randomization to Plavix or Cangrelor.
ECG [**2159-10-11**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-10-10**] left bundle-branch block is no longer recorded and the rate is slower.
ECG [**2159-10-12**]: Sinus rhythm.
Left bundle-branch block is new as compared with prior tracing of [**2159-10-11**] and similar to that recorded on [**2159-10-10**].
Right Femoral Vascular US [**2159-10-13**]: RIGHT FEMORAL VASCULAR ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color and pulse wave Doppler examination was performed in the right groin region.
Examination reveals a 3.1 x 2.7 x 1.7 cm pseudoaneurysm in the right groin, with visualization of the neck connecting the pseudoaneurysm to the right common femoral artery.
IMPRESSION: Pseudoaneurysm arising from right common femoral artery as described above.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 82 year old male with history of multiple myocardial infarctions, coronary artery bypass graft with four vein grafts in [**2141**], and chronic angina who was found to have NSTEMI at an outside hospital, underwent cardiac cath there demonstrating three vessel coronary artery disease and left main stenosis.
1) Coronary Artery Disease: Cardicac catheterization demonstrated three vessel disease and 70% stenosis of the left main coronary artery which was successfully stented with a drug eluting stent.
An ECHO at the outside hospital on [**2159-10-8**] showed normal left ventricular systolic function with EF 40-45%.
You had the cardiac catheterization performed and had a stent placed in one of your heart vessels.
