He was admitted for observation and discharged the ensuing day after a head CT demonstrating no interval change.
His follow up head CT at that time revealed a new L SDH measuring 8 mm.
This was followed up with a CT on [**2123-12-9**] that revealed stable hematoma size.
He returned on [**2124-1-20**] for a follow up with a head CT that showed liquidation of the SDH but with increased size.
In this context, he was going to be monitored with serial imaging.
he has no pronator drift, and he is full strength   Pertinent Results: IMAGING:  Head CT on [**2124-1-27**] compared to [**2124-1-20**].
MRI [**2124-1-27**]: MRA HEAD: Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
