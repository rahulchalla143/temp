No foley catheter/tracheostomy/PEG/ventilator support/chest, tube/colostomy    Pertinent Results: CT L-spine ([**2103-12-3**]): 1.
MR may be helpful if further evaluation is indicated.
CT Pelvis ([**2103-12-3**]): 1.
Hip and L-spine X RAY [**2103-12-2**]: No acute fracture or dislocation.
Please refer to the concurrent  CT pelvis for additional findings of a large left inguinal hernia.
Echo ([**2-6**]): CONCLUSIONS 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low-normal, with an estimated LVEF of 50-55 %.
The right ventricular systolic function is moderately impaired.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2-4**], right heart findings are worse.
[**2103-12-10**] ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
IMPRESSION: Atrial fibrillation making evaluation of ventricular function challenging.
CHEST X RAY PA/LAT [**2103-12-3**]: Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema and small left  pleural effusion in the setting of cardiomegaly.
CHEST X RAY AP PORTABLE [**2103-12-10**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-7**], there is little overall change.

Hypoxia / acute on chronic diastolic CHF:  Patient presented with a new oxygen requirement, satting 94% on 3L NC with bilateral rales on exam and a reported 10 lb weight gain over his dry weight with concern for pulmonary edema.
CXR revealed moderate pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion in the setting of cardiomegaly, BNP was > 3000.
He ruled out for an MI, his repeat echocardiogram revealed a normal EF and mild LVH.
He was given agressive potassium repletion during diuresis and his potassium remained at 3.1 upon discharge.
He was discharged home at his dry weight of 175 lbs, had a room air O2 sat of 97% and a ambulatory O2 sat on room air of 91%.
Back and Leg pain: CT demonstrated mild degenerative changes in the pelvis but no fractures.
Given the improvement in his symptoms he was treated conservatively however an MRI of the spine is indicated as an outpatient to further assess for severity of spinal stenosis.
