As previously mentioned, Ms. [**Known lastname 8529**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a wedge resection of the posterior segment of her right upper lobe on [**2162**] for first instance of adenocarcinoma of the lung which was T1, N0, M0.
911 was called and the patient was found alert and oriented times three, but with O2 saturations on 5 liters (which was her discharge oxygen requirement) of 56%.
The patient was subsequently brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment.
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation, the patient had the following physical exam:  Her temperature is 97.0, heart rate is 95 and regular, blood pressure was 143/78 on dopamine and Neo-Synephrine.
She was on assist control 18/500, 100% FIO2, her PEEP was 10, her peak pressure is 33, plateau pressure is 24, and she was sating roughly 94%.
The day of discharge, the patient's physical examination was as follows:  Her temperature is 98.8, heart rate was 81 and regular, blood pressure is 129/61.
She was on pressure support of 10 and 5, tidal volume 400, respiratory rate of 20, and FIO2 is 40%.
The laceration on the left forearm was dressed and her trache site was clean, dry, and intact.
LABORATORIES:  Laboratory data on admission, the patient had the following laboratories:  White count is 10.3, hematocrit 30.0, platelets 448, and MCV of 85.
Her Chem-7 was as follows:  Sodium 141, potassium 5.4, chloride 100, bicarb 32.
BUN 19, creatinine 0.6, glucose 170, calcium 9.2, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 5.0.
Her coags were 13.1, 27.1 with an INR of 1.1.
Her lactate level was 1.0.
She had a chest x-ray which showed cardiomegaly, pleural thickening with volume loss in the right, patchy density in the lower up and mid right lower lobe.
Sputum from the outside hospital on [**4-30**]:  Her bronch had grown [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
Her culture data here at [**Hospital3 **] was all negative including multiple blood cultures and urine cultures.
Her sputum did grow out 4+ gram-positive cocci in pairs, but no predominance of a pathogen.
Electrocardiogram initially showed 58 beats per minute accelerated junctional rhythm, normal axis and normal intervals, but the P-R was not clearly seen and there was a question of whether there was AV beat association.
The patient had CT scan of the chest which showed a right hydropneumothorax at the upper lobe on the right, right lower lobe fibrosis, consolidation, small right effusion, and a left sided bullae with minimal effusion.
Patient also had an echocardiogram which demonstrated the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated, left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, RV was dilated, there was a right ventricular pressure overload into her pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
The day of discharge the patient had the following laboratory values:  Her white count is 16.8, roughly 93% polys and 5% lymphocytes, hematocrit 33.0.
Chem-7:  140 of sodium, potassium 3, chloride 99, bicarb 31, BUN 28, creatinine 0.3, glucose 122.
Calcium 8.2, magnesium 1.6, phosphorus 4.0.
However, the patient continued to have heavy secretions and [**Hospital6 1834**] bronchoscopy which demonstrated these copious secretions, but no further acute pulmonary processes.
She during the course of her hospital stay after initial intubation dropped her pressures and required two pressors to support her blood pressure.
These pressors were rapidly weaned within 24 hours and her blood pressure remained stable for the duration of her hospital course.
At one time, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, was treated with diltiazem, and subsequently cardioverted.
The patient on hospital day #4, had increase in her blood pressure to probably her baseline hypertensive level.
As an outpatient, she should avoid all nodal blocking agents.
Potassium [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq po q day to be titrated daily.
