CT Head [**2186-4-2**] 7:16 PM: 1.
MRI with diffusion-weighted images is more sensitive in the detection of acute infarction.
CXR [**2186-4-2**] 7:00 PM: Cardiomegaly.
Imaging: CXR [**2186-4-4**] 2:52 PM: Persistent atelectasis and/or consolidation left lung base.
Video Speech and Swallow Evaluation [**2186-4-7**]: Pt demonstrates a mild oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced bolus formation and control, prolonged mastication of all textures, mild swallow initiation delay, and reduced valve closure.
Please reconsult if pt's performance improves such that upgrade to regular solids might be reasonable and a repeat swallow evaluation can be completed at that time.

Vancomycin was discontinued after a 5 day course as urine and blood cultures were negative.
A video swallow examination was perfromed and showed that the patient is able to take thin liquids with a straw and pureed food with 1:1 meal assist.
