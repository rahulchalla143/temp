Surface Echo [**2169-1-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
coag negative oxacillin resistent bactremia which was thought to be due to mitral valve endocarditis.
She recieved dialysis until she was below her dry weight and then recieved dialysis per renal and her fluid status.
Her platelets were trending down in the last days of life and it was thought to be due to linezolid bone marrow suppression or, less likely, HIT.
Her DIC labs were negative.
After the patient's lactate was found to be 5 with a new anion gap acidosis, a repeat echocardiogram revealed worsening TR and pulm regurgitation, with severe mitral regurgitation.
CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism.
Her elevated lactate and new echo findings were consistent with decompensating shock likely of a combined sepsis/cardiogenic.
A cardiology consultation was obtained, which indicated continuing cardiogenic shock with a complonent of sepsis as well.
