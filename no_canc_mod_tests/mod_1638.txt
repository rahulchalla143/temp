After resting his oxygen saturation improved to the high 80's, however when he walked around the room he continued to desaturate to the 80's on 3-4LNC.
A CXR was done that showed the known RUL PNA, and he continued to complain that he felt "hot" at night, so he was sent to the ER for further evaluation as his physician was concerned that he could have an infected bullous.
In the ER since he was desaturating with ambulation, a CTA of his chest was done that showed multiple small pulmonary emboli, worsening of the RUL pneumonia and fluid in the fluid in the right upper lobe in bullae of unclear etiology.
His labs were notable for a white count of 13.3 with 78%N, no bands.
During his ER course he continued to desaturate on 4LNC, and eventually required a NRB to keep his oxygen saturation in the 93-96% range, although he did not have any increased work of breathing or any signs of respiratory distress.
VS on transfer were: 81, 131/70, 20, 93-96% on NRB.

IMAGING CTA [**2137-8-8**]: 1.
#) Pneumonia and possible infected bullae: The patient was recently hospitalized for a presumed CAP but failed treatment and re-presented with worsening hypoxia, continued fever and CT findings of possible infected bullae vs. necrotizing pneumonia.
Multiple induced sputum cultures were sent however all were contaminated with saliva.
Patients oxygen saturations were noted to improve, he remained afebrile with a down trending WBC; therefore, he was transferred to the floor.
On the floor he was maintained on supplemental oxygen as needed to keep oxygen saturations above 92%.
#) Multiple Pulmonary Emboli: Multiple PEs were seen on CTA chest, likely contributing to his significant hypoxia, but he was otherwise asymptomatic (no chest pain, tachycardia.).
#) Transaminitis: Patient with elevation of his AST and ALT during hospitalization.
#) Mild Normocytic Anemia: baseline HCT as an outpatient is in the low 40's, during his last hospital stay HCT was between 34 and 37, has remained stable since that time, likely due to the inflammation from his current illness.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
#) Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Continue CPAP at night with supplemental oxygen with goal to keep oxygen sat > 92%, .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Beta-glucan and galactomannan pending at discharge - will be followed up by primary team # Outpatient work-up for elevated AST/ALT # Code: Full (confirmed with patient)   Medications on Admission: 1. pravastatin 40 mg DAILY 2. diltiazem HCl 120 mg ER DAILY 3. cefpodoxime 200 mg twice a day for 6 days.
Oxygen Oxygen 2 - 4 L/minute to maintain oxygen saturation of 90 - 93%.
A chest xray and CT both showed worsening of your pneumonia and pulmonary embolism.
