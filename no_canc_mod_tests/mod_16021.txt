Patient was admitted to the outside hospital on [**2108-6-14**] experiencing a sudden onset of [**6-14**] midsternal chest pressure associated with dyspnea while doing yard work.
Patient called his wife and was seen by his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] sent him straight to the Emergency Department, where he had blood pressure of 138/58, pulse of 86.
Patient had an electrocardiogram done which showed questionable new left bundle branch block.
Patient was started on a heparin drip, nitroglycerin drip, beta-blocker and was taken to catheterization which showed RA pressures of 4, RV pressures of 23/14, PA 23/67, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of [**5-12**].
LV gram showing ejection fraction of 50%, apical and anteroapical hypokinesis, left dominant system, 80% ostial left anterior descending, 90% ramus with TIMI 1 flow, large dominant circumflex, normal nondominant right coronary artery.
Patient's serial cardiac enzymes were CKs of 238, 15, 1306, MB of 12.2, 73.6, 149, troponin T of 0.19, 0.28, 0.99, respectively.
Total cholesterol of 270, HDL of 71.
Runs [**2-8**] miles several times a week.
On admission to the Coronary Care Unit, patient had a temperature of 99.5.
Pulse 65.
Blood pressure 107/46.
Respiratory rate of 20.
Oxygen saturation of 98% on two liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  His pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Pulmonary:  Patient is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
INITIAL LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count of 7.5, hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 37.1, platelet count 179,000, INR of 1.1.
Chem-10:  Sodium of 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 103, bicarbonate 31, BUN 12, creatinine 0.9, glucose 110.
Calcium of 9.3, phosphorus of 2.6, magnesium 1.8.
Patient had ALT of 43, AST of 166, alkaline phosphatase 63, total bilirubin 0.8.
Patient had a CK of 1001, MB of 87, index 8.7, troponin T 3.04.
Patient's electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with rate of 63, normal axis, normal intervals, left bundle branch block.
Cardiovascular system:  Patient has two vessel coronary disease as shown by cardiac catheterization at the outside hospital.
Patient is status post myocardial infarction with 80% ostial left anterior descending, occluded of 90% ramus including TIMI 1 flow.
The objective was to keep the patient chest pain free, which we were able to achieve.
Patient was monitored for any signs of dysrhythmias, since patient has a question of left bundle branch block.
Patient's overall systolic function, ejection fraction of 50% by LV gram without evidence of congestive heart failure.
Pulmonary:  Patient obtained a chest x-ray as a part of preoperative evaluation per the cardiac bypass surgery.
Patient was instructed to follow cardiac/low sodium diet.
