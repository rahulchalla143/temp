In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.7, P 93, BP 104/56, RR 18, O2 96% on RA.
Labs were notable for elevated Cr, borderline troponin elevations, and an EKG with signs of old MI.

[**2162-8-23**] CT HEAD (most recent)- IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2162-8-20**] Admit CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: 1.
If clinical concern for fracture, dedicated maxillofacial CT scan suggested.
TTE [**2162-8-21**] : There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Initially, the patient remained neurologically intact and underwent syncope evaluation which was unrevealing.
His INR was reversed with vitamin K and FFP.
During his stay, the following issues were addressed: 1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage:  Neuro checks were done Q2;  mental status was responsive and oriented to person but not place or time on presentation and he had no focal neurological deficits.
Head CT showed an intraparencyhmal hemorrhage in the right temperoparietal region that was stable on repeat head CTs.
We performed a basic syncope work-up; chest x-ray revealed no sources of infection, UA showed growth of enterococcus: received 2 doses of ampicillin, however this was discontinued after it was noted colonies were < 100,000 and WBCs in urine were very few.
No ASA given bleeding risk and no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 1-2 mg Injection PRN (as needed) as needed for seizure.
