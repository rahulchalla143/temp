Apgars were 8 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, weight was 776 grams, 25th to 50th percentile, length 33.5 cm, 30th percentile, head circumference 22 cm, 10th to 25th percentile.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - Anterior fontanel soft and flat, sutures open and mobile, eyes fused.
Her    initial ventilatory settings were peak expiratory pressure    of 24 over a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5,    intermittent mandatory ventilator rate of 25.
She    managed to wean to very low ventilator settings of 16/5    and a rate of 15 by day of life #2.
She remained on low settings on her    ventilator, with some fluctuation, and ultimately had a    trial of Lasix and was started on Diuril around day of    life 36.
An echocardiogram was obtained, which    showed a small patent ductus arteriosus with left-to-right    flow.
A repeat echocardiogram on [**4-1**]    showed a persistent patent ductus arteriosus, and she    received a second course of indomethacin.
Followup    echocardiogram on [**4-2**] showed no patent ductus    arteriosus.
This echocardiogram showed no vegetation of    the heart.
Systolic blood    pressures are 60-70s, diastolics 30-40s, with means in the 40-    50s.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION.
Her last    electrolytes on [**7-9**] - sodium 139, potassium 5.0, chloride    106, CO2 24.
Her last nutrition labs on [**6-7**] showed calcium 10, phosphorus 5.9, alkaline phosphatase 97.
On [**5-24**], she had an ALT of 13 and an AST of 28.
Discharge weight is 3420g, discharge head circumference    35.5cm, discharge length 52.0.
The infant's hematocrit at birth was 43.7.
The most    recent hematocrit on [**6-28**] was 36.4, with a reticulocyte    count of 2.9%.
[**Known lastname **] required treatment for    unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy, with a    peak serum bilirubin on day of life 3 of 4.0/0.6 mg/dl    direct.
Had a rebound bilirubin on [**4-10**], with total of    2.1 and 0.4 mg/dl direct.
Due to her prematurity, with unknown group    B streptococcus status, [**Known lastname **] was evaluated for sepsis at    time of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.
Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of    32,000 with a differential of 72% PMN cells, 1% band    neutrophils.
A blood culture was obtained prior to    starting antibiotics.
The blood culture was "no growth" at    72 hours, and the antibiotics were discontinued.
On [**4-12**], due to increased ventilatory settings, another complete    blood count and CBC were obtained.
The white blood cell    count was 15,700 with a differential of 54%    polymorphonuclear cells, 4% band neutrophils.
The blood    culture was "no growth."
A complete blood count had a white count of    29,900 with a differential of 54 polymorphonuclear cells    and 7 percent band neutrophils.
Blood culture was    obtained.
Blood culture subsequently grew Staph    aureus.
She also had further surveillance studies, including a    lumbar puncture which was negative, weekly CBCs and LFTs,    which remained ultimately within normal limits, a head    ultrasound on [**4-20**] which was within normal limits, and an    ECHO which did not show any cardiac vegetations.
Subsequent x-rays did show ulnar and humerus involvement of    osteomyelitis.
She has had serial head ultrasounds which    have been within normal limits.
Head circumference should be followed clinically.
Audiology - Hearing screening was performed with    automated auditory brainstem response.
This has    been improving, with last exam on [**7-7**] revealing Stage I ROP    in zone III in right eye, and immature retina zone III in left    eye.
Two state screens were positive for cystic fibrosis,    by screening and genetic analysis.
Subsequent genetic testing    at Ambry Genetics ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 60434**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60435**]) confirmed    that patient is a cystic fibrosis carrier with one identified    mutation.
Although only one mutation was found, the    possibility that she has a second unidentified and untested    mutation, which would make her a cystic fibrosis patient    rather than a carrier, cannot be ruled out, and infant should    be tested with a sweat test in the future.
State newborn screening: other than cystic fibrosis testing as    described above, state newborn screens have been within normal    limits.
