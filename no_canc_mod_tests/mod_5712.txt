In the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department the patient was found to have a blood pressure of 65/47, heart rate 79, temperature 96.8 F.  He was emergently intubated for hypoxemia and airway protection.
Despite intravenous fluids the patient's blood pressure did not increase and he was initiated on Neo-Synephrine.
One set of cardiac enzymes was negative and a CT angiogram of the chest was performed which indicated no pulmonary embolism.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature equals 98 F, heart rate 55, blood pressure 100/47, and vent settings are AC 500, rate 10, PEEP of 5, and an FIO2 of 50 percent.
HEENT examination demonstrates conjunctival edema.
Cardiovascular exam is irregular irregular, S1 and S2 without murmur.
Respiratory examination demonstrates decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, rhonchi on the right side appreciated.
A CT angiogram at the outside hospital was    negative for an aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
Cultures that were    drawn at [**Hospital6 4620**] were negative.
A sputum culture from [**2173-2-19**] was    positive for E. Coli, two different morphologies,    multiresistant, but this organism was sensitive to    Meropenum, Tobramycin, Bactrim, cefepime, and Gentamicin.
The patient's sputum culture from [**2173-3-21**] also    demonstrated MRSA.
These were continued until the results of the sputum culture returned.
A repeat thoracentesis was performed on [**2173-3-23**], which demonstrated a transudative fluid which, upon culture and cytology, was negative.
His breathing became more labored presumably secondary to decreased chest wall compliance secondary to this edema, potential aspirations, and pleural effusion, and a VVD demonstrated hypercarbia on [**2173-4-9**].
Blood cultures, urine culture, portal    fluid cultures were followed.
The patient's sputum culture was positive for MRSA and E. Coli, as above.
Patient's blood cultures from [**2173-3-28**] returned positive for E. coli and he had intermittent meropenem added to Gentamicin at that time.
His cardiac function was initially evaluated with transthoracic echocardiogram which demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 percent without significant abdominal aortic compromise or pericardial fluid.
A TEE was performed on [**2173-3-29**] which demonstrated no vegetation.
An abdominal CT scan on [**2173-3-31**] without contrast demonstrated a potential ________ tumors, although infection could not be ruled out.
Repeat CT scan of the abdomen with contrast on [**2173-4-1**] demonstrated no enhancement of these areas of concern.
Stool cultures were negative for C. difficile.
Despite this he    developed hematochezia on [**2173-3-30**] with a hematocrit    that decreased from 29 to 23.
A GI consult was obtained and recommended conservative    management at that time with close monitoring of serial    hematocrits.
The patient's IVC vena gram demonstrated that this was    widely patent, and no intervention was performed.
A second opinion is pending at the time of this dictation.
An EP study was recommended at a later    date given his acuity of illness.
The patient responded well with heart rates being in the 70s and 80s after being maintained on this medication.
Further hemodialysis sessions were    performed from this line secondary concerns for diminished    blood flow in the left upper extremity secondary to the    SVC syndrome.
a repeat [**Last Name (un) **] stim test    demonstrated a basal cortisol level of 43.4 and a 60-    minute post stim value of 52.6.
