The patient was found to be in rapid AFib with HR in the 150's and was treated with a diltiazem gtt and eventually transitioned to PO dilt and digoxin.
While on the floor, troponin rose to 19.32 -> 112.2 -> 116.6 while on the floor (CK 1113 -> 2417 -> 2165, CK-MB 255 -> 392 -> 264).
Chest pain resolved and prior to transfer for cardiac cath, the patient was chest pain-free, V/S 98.5, 107/64, 60-70s, 18, 94%2L.

Resting hemodynamics revealed low systemic blood pressure and high LV filling pressure.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-70%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-7-25**], the inferolateral effusion is identified (prior study only had subcostal views and this may not reflect a true change).
Serial evaluation is suggested.
[**7-27**] TTE Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-7-26**], the pericardial findings are similar.
[**8-3**] CXR There is probably a small right pneumothorax primarily lateral and anterior, stable since [**8-2**] at 2:06 p.m.
The patient's Hct dropped to 17 and she emergently transfused a total of 5U pRBC.
It was noted that after placment of the a-line that dopplerable pulses were lost on the right foot.
Her arterial line was removed, but distal pulses were still not dopplerable.
The patient underwent serial TTE that did not show tamponade and her drainage of her catheter stopped within 24hrs.
Her drain was removed on [**7-26**] and repeat TTE did not show further accumulation.
The patient's Hct remained stable and no further evidence of tamponade.
The patient did not show evidence of comparment syndrome and CK remained wnl.
HAP: The patient had a CXR that showed left retrocardiac opacity.
Sputum cultures were sent that initally grew GNR and GPC.
Her sputum culture subsequently grew pseudomonas and was changed to meropenem for a planned 14 day course.
Additionally, her cultures also grew stenotrophomonas sensitive to levofloxacin, which was not treated initially as her respiratory status seemed gradually improving.
However, daily CXR began to show increased RUL consolidation and treatment with Levofloxacin was started [**8-3**] for a full 10 day course.
CORONARIES: Patient presented to OSH on [**7-20**] with chest pain and found to be in rapid AFib with HR in the 150's and was treated with a diltiazem gtt and eventually transitioned to PO dilt and digoxin.
Her initial troponin in the ED was 0.16, BNP 1080.
However, while on the floor, her troponin rose to 19.32 -> 112.2 -> 116.6 (CK 1113 -> 2417 -> 2165, CK-MB 255 -> 392 -> 264).
Chest pain resolved prior to transfer for cardiac cath.
She underwent cardiac cath on [**7-21**], which showed a focal LAD lesions that appeared calcified that was not thrombotic or ulcerated in appearance.
TTE showed that the right ventricular cavity was moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis, EF 45%.
She was restarted on metoprolol and lisinopril after her blood pressures had stablized.
Her EF was reportedly 60-65% on TTE at OSH on [**2185-6-21**].
serial TTE performed during her admission showed an EF 45%.
Her CXR [**7-27**] showed volume overload and she was given 40mg IV lasix x2.
BNP was in the 13,000s the day of discharge but goal remained to keep her euvolemic.
She underwent EPS and pacemaker placement that was complicated by RV perforation and right leg ischemia on [**7-25**].
The patient went into a-fib with RVR on [**7-28**] with rates 100-140's.
Her respiratory status was complicated by her baseline COPD (on 2-3L at home), HAP and pulmonary edema.
A pulmonary consultation earlier in the admission recommended a non-contrast chest CT for evaluation of the right hilum, which can be done outpatient.
Vital signs have been stable, patient able to sit in chair.
You underwent cardiac cath that showed an occlusion of your blood vessel in your heart.
You underwent an EP study and placement of a pacemaker.
Additionally, you had a clot in your right leg that compromised blood flow.
