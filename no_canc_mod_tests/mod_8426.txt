HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery x 2, aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension with a prolonged complicated recent hospital course at [**Hospital1 1444**] from [**1-30**] to [**2104-3-26**].
The patient was transferred from an outside hospital on [**2104-1-30**] with new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction for cardiac catheterization.
On cardiac catheterization the patient was noted to have left main and two-vessel disease with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and severe pulmonary hypertension.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by hypotension requiring pressors, failure to extubate, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate with failure to cardiovert, and acutely worsening congestive heart failure with a decreased ejection fraction of less than 20% (prior to coronary artery bypass grafting the patient's ejection fraction was 50%).
Post cardiac catheterization the patient developed acute renal failure with volume overload requiring CVVH, worsening heart failure requiring intra-aortic balloon pump complicated by rectus sheath hematoma, and ventricular fibrillation arrest requiring amiodarone and lidocaine.
An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed on [**3-11**] with dual pacer (the delay in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement was secondary to multiple infections throughout the hospitalization including yeast graft harvest site, wound infection, Enterobacter bacteremia, C. difficile colitis, and yeast cystitis).
A repeat echocardiogram demonstrated a thrombus on the aortic valve anterior leaflet.
Repeat catheterization on [**2104-2-9**] with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting to the LIMA-LAD-SVG-diagonal.
Echocardiogram in [**2104-2-16**] had an ejection fraction of less than 20%, severely depressed left ventricular systolic function, severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and bileaflet aortic valve without aortic regurgitation and normal gradient.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.4, heart rate 72, blood pressure 103/34, respiratory rate 17, oxygen saturation 97% on CPAP pressure support of 15, PEEP of 5 and FIO2 of 50%.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no rhonchi, and well-healed midline sternal incision.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, warm and well perfused, with 1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally, left lower extremity thigh wound at the graft incision packed with occlusive dressing and no purulent drainage.
LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 10.7, hematocrit 27.9, platelet count 315.
Chem-7 with a sodium of 131, potassium 3.8, chloride 93, bicarbonate 28, BUN 70, creatinine 1.2, and glucose 455 (status post two amps of D50 for a glucose of 33).
White blood cell differential 91% polys, 0% bands, 5% lymphocytes.
Chest x-ray on admission showed no evidence of pneumothorax, ICD leads in good position, bilateral lower lobe atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions.
EKG on admission was normal sinus rhythm at 90 with left bundle branch block, left axis, Q waves in leads 2, 3 and aVF with poor R wave progression (unchanged compared with [**2104-2-16**]).
Microbiology of note during the hospitalization with swab cultures from the ICD pocket from admission on [**4-12**] with 3+ Gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters, culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus (sensitivities pending).
Blood culture and urine culture from admission were without growth.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, the electrophysiology, CT surgery and infectious disease services were consulted.
Per electrophysiology and CT surgery recommendations, the patient was taken to the operating room for ICD box removal.
Because the patient's admission INR was 2.7, only the ICD box was removed; the pacer/defibrillator leads were capped and left in place for future removal.
An intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of less than 20% with 2% mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation and no evidence of valvular vegetation.
The Staphylococcus aureus sensitivities are still pending at the time of dictation.
The patient has remained afebrile throughout the hospital course and blood cultures remain no growth to date.
The patient was restarted on low-dose aspirin, statin (with lipids:  total cholesterol 221, LDL 147, HDL 45, and triglycerides 113), and low-dose enalapril for known coronary artery disease (A low-dose beta blocker was not started during the hospitalization secondary to congestive heart failure exacerbation.
The patient's Coumadin was held during the hospitalization with the initiation of heparin at an INR of less than 2.5.
On hospital day number three, with an INR of 2.2 and four units of fresh frozen plasma, the patient's ICD leads were removed by electrophysiology without complications.
Echocardiogram during the procedure and repeat echocardiogram several hours later was without evidence of pericardial effusion.
Repeat echocardiogram demonstrated a decreased gradient of 43.
The patient's echocardiogram demonstrated persistent biventricular failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20%, 2+ MR, and 2+ TR.
On hospital day three (off diuretics for a total of five days), the patient developed pulmonary edema as seen on chest x-ray with coincidental decreased oxygen saturations.
Despite the slow response, the patient's oxygen saturations were improved and remained stable in the mid-90s.
The patient's blood glucose normalized after approximately 24 hours off dextrose supplements.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was intolerant of tube feeds early in the hospital course secondary to persistent nausea and vomiting, despite Reglan and Zofran.
Hematology:  The patient's admission hematocrit was low at 27 (down from her prior baseline hematocrit of 29-31).
The patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout the hospitalization until hospital day four ([**4-15**]) when the patient's hematocrit dropped to 26.6 from 29.3.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20%.
per PEG tube (dosed for INR 2.5 to 3.5).
The patient has been started back on Coumadin and will continue on Coumadin for an INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
The patient will require one unit transfusion of packed red blood cells on arrival to rehabilitation for an hematocrit of 26.6 on [**4-15**].
The patient will need further work-up for her down-trending hematocrit if this persists.
