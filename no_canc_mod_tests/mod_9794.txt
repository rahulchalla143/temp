Right heart cath showed right atrial pressure of 12, right ventricular pressures of 40/10, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18.
Procedure was complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation for which the patient received Lopressor IV and decreased his rate from 130's to 90's.
He continued to have residual [**2130-1-14**] chest pain on arrival to the CCU and heart rate of 90-110 atrial fibrillation, systolic blood pressure 130-140.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to the CCU the patient's hematocrit was 42, white count 8.6, platelet count 266,000, potassium 4.3, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0, total cholesterol panel was checked which revealed total cholesterol of 213, HDL 51, LDL 145, CKs on arrival were 54 with troponin less than 0.3.
EKG after catheterization revealed atrial fibrillation at 114, ST elevations 2-3 mm in F, 3 and 2, small Q waves inferior [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V2 to V3, normal axis and intervals.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was in atrial fibrillation at a rate of 110-120's, blood pressure 140/90, satting 99% on two liters, respiratory rate 12.
Neck revealed JVP to angle of the jaw at 15 degrees, carotids 2+ without bruits, trachea midline, chest was clear to auscultation without wheezes or rales.
Cardiovascular exam was irregularly irregular, tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdominal exam was benign.
Neuro exam was grossly intact.
Follow-up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction mildly depressed at 45-55%.
His hematocrit remained stable, did not significantly drop.
