Her headache was reported as a sudden onset with sharp stabbing pain throughout her head, initially focusing around the periorbital area.
On [**2139-7-24**], she went to an outside hospital where a CT was done.
Per report the CT was negative and so an LP was performed, which showed 100 white blood cells and 12,000 red blood cells in the first two and 100 white blood cells and 11,000 red blood cells in the fourth.
She has subsequently been transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further arrangement.
INVESTIGATIONS:  A CT of the head performed at [**Hospital1 **] was negative for any subarachnoid hemorrhage.
CT angiogram performed showed a PICA aneurysm that appeared lobulated with a 4 mm neck.
Her labs on admission were unremarkable.
She was taken to the Intensive Care Unit where an A-line was placed and her blood pressure was monitored for a goal of less than 130 systolic blood pressure using Nipride to titrate.
Her blood pressure remained controlled on Nipride.
Followup CT scans were unchanged.
On subarachnoid day four, we started to increase her blood pressure parameters as well as her CVP for systolic blood pressure goals greater than 150 and CVP goals of 6 to 8.
Ultimately, CT scan had a slight suggestion of increased pressure and she underwent a lumbar drain placement.
The opening pressure was 26 cmH2O.
The lumbar drain was removed.
On [**2139-7-31**], she also underwent a repeat angiogram to reassess for vasospasm.
There was no evidence of vasospasm on angiogram and good coiling of left PCA was evidenced.
Her vital signs remained stable.
A goal systolic blood pressure of greater than 110 was targeted.
Subsequent days, her blood pressure was kept above 100 and above 85.
Neurologic exam was nondiagnostic and ultimately they recommended to followup in the Outpatient Clinic and possibly an angiogram to assess her filling defects or delays of the ophthalmic artery.
