The patient was then noted to have a sudden decrease level of consciousness with a heart rate on the pulse oximeter noted to be down to 44.
Furthermore, the patient also had a few more episodes of decreased responsiveness with heart rates in the 40s and systolic blood pressures to the 80s.
The electrocardiogram obtained at that time showed that the patient was bradycardic secondary to Mobitz type I AV block as well as ST depressions in V1 and AVL.
The patient's chest x-ray at this time was negative for any acute process.
Esophagitis 9.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature was 98??????.
Pulse was 109.
Blood pressure 121/48 and O2 saturation was 97% on 4 liters.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
ADMISSION LABS:  CBC:  White blood count was 6.0, hematocrit 42.1, platelets 158.
CK was 32.
Troponin was 0.4.
Electrolytes:  Sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 99, bicarbonate 30, BUN 18, creatinine 0.5, glucose 187.
CARDIAC:  An echocardiogram was obtained on the date of admission which showed preserved biventricular systolic function as well as aortic sclerosis.
Left ventricular ejection fraction was greater than 55%.
GASTROINTESTINAL/FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient had coffee ground emesis on admission and as well in the Emergency Room.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable.
Subsequently, after the patient was transferred to the floor, speech and swallow evaluation was performed on [**2192-7-6**] which the patient failed.
The patient's electrolytes were checked q day and repleted as necessary.
PULMONARY:  On the day after admission, the patient had a follow up chest x-ray which showed interval development of a left lower lobe consolidation and collapse as well as possibly a small left pleural effusion.
Given the rapid change from her unremarkable chest x-ray on admission, this is likely aspiration pneumonia as related to her emesis.
The culture which was obtained was contaminated was oropharyngeal flora.
The patient's O2 saturations improved throughout her stay and the patient requires some suctioning in order to clear the phlegm in the back of her throat.
In addition, the patient's white blood cell count spiked to 32.9 and subsequently has come down throughout her stay to a normal white blood count of 7.1.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient has hypothyroidism and her TSH was checked and was within normal limits at 0.77.
