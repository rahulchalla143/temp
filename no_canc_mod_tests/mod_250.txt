[**2138-9-1**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**8-25**], there has been substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions.
Initial evaluation with urine electrolytes, renal ultrasound, and renal ultrasound with doppler evaluation made pre-renal etiology or post-renal etiology less likely.
Urine sediment was generally unremarkable.
Renal biopsy was pursued and demonstrated crescentic glomerulonephritis in the setting of ANCA positivity.
Her INR was slightly elevated to 1.3 on admission and had minimal improvement with Vitamin K administration.
Mixing study and lupus anticoagulant testing was performed and were both positive.
