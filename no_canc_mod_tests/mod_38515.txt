Bibasilar opacities and pleural effusions; pneumonia cannot be excluded.
CXR showed questionable bibasilar infiltrate with R > L pleural effusions.
Urinary legionella was negative, sputum culture grew yeast which is a contaminant.
On reconsideration, cough and dyspnea are better explained by bronchitis than pneumonia given absence of radiographic or physical examination findings consistent with pneumonia.
