Admission Date:  [**2124-10-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-10-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-9-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain and wide complex tachycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EP study internal cardiac defibrillator placed   History of Present Illness: 51M with CAD s/p PCIX2 to the LCx ([**2117**],[**2121**]), systolic CHF (EF=40% in [**2121**]) and T2DM, COPD on home O2, who was transfered from OSH after multiple shocks for wide-complex tachycardia.
Patient was noted to have the onset of chest pain the night prior to admission, he subsequently called 911, EMS found him in resp distress, diaphoretic, WCT on monitor @ 180?????
None of these interventions terminated his WCT and he was then given a metoprolol IV with reported improvement in his heart rate to the 100s.
At OSH noted to be hypoxic to the 80s and CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was intubated/vented on fent/versed, CMV FiO2: 100% PEEP: 18 RR: 24 Vt:470, initial vitals were 129 97/70 81%.
- CXR showed diffuse bil alveolar infiltrates consistent with florid pulmonary edema.
- Chem 7, CBC showed WBC 19.0, hyperglycemia to 433 but was otherwise unremarkable.
WBC = 19.0 - ECG (my read) shows regular tachycardia 110 with leftish axis WNL and LBBB morphology which is consistent with his prior baseline and without precordial concordence.
Rythm looks like sinus tachycardia, as P waves identified consistent with prior tracing with PR = 0.16.
Past Medical History: Diabetes, Hypertension CAD (s/p PCI with stents to LCX in [**2117**], s/p cardiac cath [**2121**], which showed in-stent restenosis of patient's prior LCx stent, and underwent thrombectomy and re-stenting. )
sys+diast CHF ([**2121**] ECHO showed akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and mild global hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF=40%).
Neck: supple, difficult to assess JVP but no ovious JVD.
Right groin hematoma appears stable, s/p attempted femoral line in OSH.

Further assessment with chest CT is recommended.
Endotracheal tube ending 4.8 cm above the carina  ECHO [**2124-10-17**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to akinesis of the entire posterior wall, and hypokinesis (with regional variation) of the rest of the left ventricle - basal segments relatively well-preserved.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CXR [**2124-10-18**]: IMPRESSION:  Almost complete resolution of bilateral diffuse airspace opacifications consistent with diagnosis of pulmonary edema.
Cardiac MRI [**2124-10-20**]: Mildly enlarged left atrium and normal size right atrium.
Transmural late gadolinium enhancement of the antero-basal and mid-basal antero-lateral wall, consistent with fibrosis or scar, and low likelihood of contractile recovery after revascularization.
ECHO [**2124-10-25**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %).
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
CXR [**2124-10-26**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.
Labs on Discharge: [**2124-10-26**] 06:58AM BLOOD WBC-6.1 RBC-3.67* Hgb-11.8* Hct-34.0* MCV-93 MCH-32.2* MCHC-34.7 RDW-12.2 Plt Ct-188 [**2124-10-26**] 06:58AM BLOOD Glucose-158* UreaN-16 Creat-0.9 Na-136 K-4.2 Cl-103 HCO3-25 AnGap-12 [**2124-10-26**] 06:58AM BLOOD Mg-2.0  Brief Hospital Course: 51M with CAD s/p PCIX2 to the LCx ([**2117**], [**2121**]), systolic CHF (EF=40% in [**2121**]) and T2DM, COPD on home O2, who developed chest pain 1 day prior to admission was then treated by EMS and OSH ED with multiple shocks and meds for a stable wide-complex tachycardia which was not terminated, subsequently intubated for hypoxia and pulmonary edema and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
ECG on admission consistent with sinus tachycrdia + LBBB.
Cardiac enzymes were trended to peak, at third set when CK and CKMB reached plateau.
An ECHO was obtained that showed overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to akinesis of the entire posterior wall, and hypokinesis (with regional variation) of the rest of the left ventricle - basal segments relatively well-preserved.
The patient then had a cardiac MRI to map out area of scar prior to EP study.
He was then taken for an EP study where it became clear that this was indeed VT.
CXR after procedure showed leads in correct place and without complication.
# Resp distress: CXR on admission consistent with pulmonary edema.
Patient with known systolic CHF with LVEF = 40% per echo [**2121**].
The patient was successfully extubated on HOD 2.
# CHF: The patient had an EF of 40% in [**2121**].
ECHO on admission showed EF of 15%, likely secondary to myocardial stunning.
Repeat ECHO the day before discharge showed EF of 25%.
Cardiac enzymes were initially trended and were initially elevated and trop up t 0.28 with elevated but flat CK and CKMB.
However, the enzymes were hard to interpret given shocks.
Information was obtained from Patient.
An electrophysiology study showed the rhythm was ventricular tachycardia.
An ICD (defibrilator) was placed.
