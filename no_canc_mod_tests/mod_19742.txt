The prenatal screens were unremarkable with maternal blood type AB positive, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune.
On admission, the temperature was 99.2, heart rate 164, blood pressure 65/38 with a mean of 47, respiratory rate 72, saturating 90-93% on room air.
The weight was 4180 grams (greater than 90th percentile), head circumference 35 cm (75th-90th percentile), length 20" (75th-90th percentile).
Eyes had red reflex present bilaterally, the palate was intact.
Initial dextrose stick was 50.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: Cardiovascular:  The baby maintained normal blood pressures and heart rates throughout the admission without any additional support.
No cardiac evaluation was thought necessary and there is no murmur audible on the discharge exam.
For this, the baby was started on nasal cannula with 100% fractional inspired oxygen and a flow rate ranging up to 500 cc/minute.
An initial chest x-ray on admission was notable for some hazy right sided opacities that appeared most consistent with TTN but could not rule out pneumonia.
A repeat chest x-ray done on the day of discharge showed improvement of the right sided opacities, and therefore this rapid resolution was more consistent with TTN rather than pneumonia.
Blood glucoses were in the normal range throughout the admission without any requirement for supplemental dextrose.
Heme/ID:  Maternal blood type was AB positive and antibody negative, so the baby's blood type was not determined.
Initial CBC on admission showed a white count of 7.1 with 59% polys, 0% bands, 39% lymphocytes; hematocrit was 51; platelets are 309.
Blood culture was sent on [**11-4**] on 6 p.m. on admission which has remained no growth to date.
Because of the chest x-ray which was concerned for possible pneumonia and respiratory distress, the baby was started on ampicillin and gentamicin, which were discontinued after the blood cultures had remained negative for 48 hours.
