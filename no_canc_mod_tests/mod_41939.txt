She was found to be guaiac + with a HCT of 22.
CT showed cecal wall thickening corresponding to mass location, mildly proominent right hilar lymphadenopathy of unclera significance, and no evidence of metastatic disease.
She received 2 u pRBC and HCT stabilized at 29.
Given patient's high surgical and procedural risk, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further pre-operative assessment and ultimately treatment of her colonic mass.
Upon transfer, patient's vitals were 112/42, 70, 18, 93% on 2L NC.
- Left foot amputation [**2150**] - GERD - Left hip fx, s/p ORIF - Carotid artery disease - diastolic heart failure   Social History: Lives alone with occasional help from HHA and help from daughters, who live nearby.
Cardiac: RRR, S1 S2, II/VI systolic murmur at RUSB, PMI non-displaced Abdomen: Midline surgical scar, soft, minimally tender to palpation, with a 3x3cm firm left periumbilical mass (old that is non-tender.
Ext: No edema, L foot amputation, Skin: Multiple ecchymoses Neuro: A+O x 3, no focal deficits  DISCHARGE EXAM: Deceased  Pertinent Results: Admission labs:  [**2165-8-1**] 09:05PM BLOOD WBC-9.4 RBC-3.36* Hgb-9.7* Hct-31.3* MCV-93 MCH-28.8 MCHC-30.9* RDW-15.7* Plt Ct-514* [**2165-8-1**] 09:05PM BLOOD Neuts-74.7* Lymphs-14.1* Monos-5.5 Eos-5.4* Baso-0.3 [**2165-8-1**] 09:05PM BLOOD PT-10.9 PTT-32.8 INR(PT)-1.0 [**2165-8-1**] 09:05PM BLOOD Glucose-112* UreaN-17 Creat-0.9 Na-142 K-4.5 Cl-98 HCO3-40* AnGap-9 [**2165-8-1**] 09:05PM BLOOD ALT-12 AST-16 LD(LDH)-195 AlkPhos-81 TotBili-0.2 [**2165-8-1**] 09:05PM BLOOD Albumin-3.9 Calcium-9.9 Phos-4.6* Mg-2.1  Imaging: CTA FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place, 3.6 cm above the carina.
Abrupt attenuation of the subsegmental and lower order branches of the bronchi supplying the lingula (4, 85-88) could represent sequela of a prior infection such as scarring (which could be correlated with prior exam if available).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Brief Hospital Course: 74F with PMH COPD on O2, CAD, HTN, DVT previously on coumadin, presented to OSH with 2 days of melena and was found to be anemic to HCT 22 with an appendical/cecal ulcerated mass.
Her bleeding had stopped by the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] and her HCT was trending up, from a nadir of 22 at OSH to 31 on hospital day 2 at [**Hospital1 18**].
An active type + screen was maintained and patient was monitored on telemetry.
# Colonic mass- Patient's 2cm, ulcerated appendiceal/cecal mass had been biopsied during colonoscopy at OSH and pathology revealed high grade dysplasia concerning for malignancy.
A rectal polyp was also removed with pathology showing a tubulovillous adenoma with high grade dysplasia.
GI at [**Hospital1 18**] was consulted and felt that mass could not be managed or excised with an endoscopic approach, so colorectal surgery was consulted.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was hemodynamically stable and telemetry demonstrated occasional PVC's, so Metoprolol was restarted.
Her urine culture showed enterococcus 10,000-100K CFU.
Information was obtained from  OSH notes; patient cannot recall med list.
