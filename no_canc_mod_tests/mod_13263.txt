He has had a drop in his ejection fraction from 55 to 45 with some wall motion abnormalities present during the echocardiogram prior to his admission.
At that time, he was scheduled for a cardiac catheterization, where he was seen preoperatively.
Catheterization report showed left main 60 percent, circumflex 70 percent, RCA 100 percent diagonal, 100 percent obtuse marginal, 80 percent concentric LVH with severe hypokinesis of the inferior base and mid to distal anterior wall.
A cardiac echocardiogram done during [**2146-1-1**] showed an ejection fraction of 45 percent with left atrial enlargement and an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm square with a peak gradient of 59 and a mean gradient of 40.
Echocardiogram additionally showed 1 plus mitral regurgitation and 1 plus tricuspid regurgitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is significant for aortic stenosis, asbestosis, hiatal hernia, atrophic right kidney, chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.4, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, bladder cancer, status post chemotherapy 18 years ago and cataracts.
Chest CT done in [**2146-1-1**] showed asbestos related lung disease with an atrophic right kidney and a small hiatal hernia.
His physical examination at the time of cardiac catheterization:  Heart rate is 54, irregularly regular.
Blood pressure is 180/80 on the right and 180/90 on the left.
Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Pulses femoral 2 plus bilaterally; dorsalis pedis pulse 2 plus on the right and 1 plus on the left.
Posterior tibial 2 plus on the right, 2 plus on the left.
At the time of transfer, the patient was A-paced at 88 beats per minute with a mean arterial pressure of 79 and a CVP of 10.
His ventilator was weaned; however, his arterial blood gases remained inadequate to extubate as he had low tidal volumes when placed on pressure support ventilation.
At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical examination is as follows:  Temperature 97.9; heart rate 62, sinus rhythm.
Blood pressure 121/54.
Respiratory rate 20.
Oxygen saturation 93 percent on room air.
At discharge, his weight is 69.5 kg.
LABORATORY DATA:  Potassium of 4.3; BUN 59; creatinine 2.6; PT  of 14; INR of 1.3.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of    2.4.
