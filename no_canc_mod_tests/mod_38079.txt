Swallow study at [**Hospital1 18**] last week suggested possible microaspiration.
Briefly:  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was hemodynamically stable, with hct of 38, INR 1, but continued hematemesis.
He was sent to the ICU for workup of UGIB.
An NG lavage had coffee grounds, not cleared with 750 cc NS.
A CXR on admission appeared to suggest a L hilar mass, but it was a poor film.
The patient was transferred to the floors for further workup as he remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit.
His health care proxy is his brother-in-law, Mr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 108573**], or his neice [**Telephone/Fax (1) 108574**].

Right axis deviation - consider left posterior fascicular block or possible biventricular hypertrophy.
CXR [**9-1**]: 1.
Recommend PA and lateral chest radiograph to further evaluation.
CXR [**9-2**]: Evidence of fairly marked background emphysema.
The NG line tip is in the upper portion of the stomach and should be advanced.
CT thorax [**9-3**]: Multiple moderately enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, several prominent R hilar lymph nodes.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the lower third of the esophagus.
A single non-bleeding 1cm ulcer was found in the stomach body.
Follow-up biopsy results If positive for H pylori, treat with triple regimen  Additional notes: Mr. [**Known lastname 17204**] should have repeat upper endoscopy in [**1-1**] months to document healing of esophageal ulcer and repeat biopsy to rule out Barrett's esophagus.
1) Hematemesis:  Pt underwent EGD which revealed ulcerations and erosions in the esophagus and stomach which were subsequently biopsied (results pending at this time of dictation).
Pt has been tolerating oral feedings without incident and his HCT was stable throughout his hospital course.
EKG on admission with ST depressions, but cardiac enzymes were negative.
His ASA will be held on discharge and will be restarted per discretion of his PCP.
3) Latent tuberculosis: Chest CT performed on [**2104-9-3**] revealed an irregular, partially calcified granuloma as well as 5mm granulomas.
A pulmonary consult was obtained and it was recommended to follow these granulomas with serial CT scans, recommended next CT to be in approximately 6-8 weeks.
follow up with your PCP in the next 1-2 weeks for results of your biopsies as well as scheduling of your CT scan in approximately 6-8 weeks.
Followup Instructions: follow up with your PCP in the next 1-2 weeks for results of your biopsies as well as scheduling of your CT scan in approximately 6-8 weeks.
