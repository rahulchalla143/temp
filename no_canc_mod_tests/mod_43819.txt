CXR showed pulmonary edema and he was given 40mg IV lasix.
ECG showed ST depressions in V4-V6 but old ECG read from [**5-1**] had called the same (actual ECG not able to be obtained).
In the ED he was sent for a head CT and before this study was performed he was found unresponsive.
Another ECG was checked and showed resolution of ST depressions in V4-6 and cardiology was called.

Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Limited resting hemodynamics showed mild pulmonary hypertension (PA mean 27 mmHg).
The cardiac output was preserved (CO 6.6 l/min, CI 3.4 l/min/m2).

Per CCU, patient was taken to the ED where CXR showed pulmonary edema.
ECG showed lateral ST depressions.
Subsequently, he was taken for cath which showed 3 vd.
Patient with cardiac catheterization showing 3 vessal coronary artery disease, not CABG candidate, being medically managed.
