Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2170-11-12**]    PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Left ventricular function.
Height: (in) 62 Weight (lb): 199 BSA (m2): 1.91 m2 BP (mm Hg): 152/44 HR (bpm): 85 Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2170-11-12**] at 13:20 Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2170-11-18**] 11:15 AM [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman s/p right colectomy.
Brief Hospital Course: She was admitted on [**2170-11-10**] with pneumatosis intestinalis and CT finding of portal vein gas.
The afternoon of [**2170-11-10**], she developed right sided peritonitis and had a WBC of 17,000.
Given the worsening exam, the decision was made to go to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy.
POD 5, she was transferred to the floor.
CV: She received 2 Units of PRBCs on POD 1 and her HCT was stable in the low 30's.
An Echo was obtained POD 2 that showed LVEF>55%.
Her HR was stable 80-100bpm with 1st degree AV block.
POD 9, she was 89% on RA and so will continue on supplemental oxygen.
