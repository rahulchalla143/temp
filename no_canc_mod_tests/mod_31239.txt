Family History: One child died at age 60 of CAD/cancer Father died at 52 of MI  Physical Exam: T- 99.4  BP- 143/77  HR- 102  RR- 38  100 O2Sat NC  FS 104 Gen: Lying in bed, tremulous and mild distress HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit CV: sinus tachycardia, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally but tachypneic aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake and alert but not coherent.
Does not cooperate with formal resistance testing but moves left arm purposefully and leg spontaneously.
Much fewer spontaneous movement from the right side but will withdraw to noxious stim bilaterally, again less on the right.

However, within the limitations of a non- contrast scan, the small bowel loops are unremarkable.
Within the liver, multiple low- attenuation lesions (2, 24 and 2, 29) are identified and not completely evaluated on this single phase study.
Contrast from prior CAT scan is seen within the collecting system of the right kidney, however, minimal contrast appears to fill the right ureter.
Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are again identified, none of which meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or major vascular territorial infarction evident on this non-contrast head CT. No change since [**2153-2-3**].
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK: The vertebral and carotid arteries are seen from the origin, intracervical courses, with no significant stenosis.
CT PERFUSION: There is an area of abnormal perfusion with increased mean transit time and decreased cerebral blood flow and blood volume, which is mild to moderate in extent, in the left posterior cerebral artery circulation distribution, concerning for an area of ischemia or infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2153-4-19**] frequent atrial premature beats are new.
An EEG showed only some mild diffuse intermittent theta-range slowing (formal report pending at time of discharge).
Since she's has such remarkable recovery and the initial imaging studies, including CT/CTA/perfusion did not reveal a LMCA stroke, and MRI was done to assess for older strokes or signs of this recent stroke.
Serial EKGs (3) and serial enzymes ruled out MI.
RESP CXR as outlined under results, no PNA.
GI/ABD/UG An abdominal scan was done for a high lactate and fever, revealing no soource of infection but a it did reveal right-sided hydronephrosis and right- sided [**Month/Day (2) 96980**] obstruction.
There also was extensive diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, multiple hepatic cysts, bilateral renal cysts that had increased in number and hypodensities in the pancreas that were anticipated.
