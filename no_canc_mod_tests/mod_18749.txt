Further characterization with MRI or CT may be helpful and/or correlation with prior cross-sectional imaging if available.
Evaluation of the pancreas is markedly limited due to overlapping gas-filled loops of bowel.
Further evaluation with MRI or CT or correlation with prior cross-sectional studies may be helpful.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 67 year old woman with history of hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension who presents with 24 hours of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, found to have pancreatitis.
Found to have necrotizing pancreatitis on CT at OSH.
We monitored her LFT's, Amylase, and Lipase as these numbers slowly declined and her pain resolved/ .
A CTA chest showed no evidence of any pulmonary embolus, bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis and some consolidation, right subclavian central venous line in situ, subcentimeter mediastinal lymphadenopathy, some perihepatic ascites She was fluid overloaded due to the aggressive hydration and required intermittent Lasix for diuresis.
