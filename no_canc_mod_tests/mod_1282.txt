Cardiology: Cath [**2136-12-27**] Hemodynamics: Elevated left heart filling pressures with preserved ci Co 4.64, CI 2.88 PCW 20 PA 39/7 Mean 16 LV 97/11 25 RV 39 end 12 Left ventriculography: No mitral regurgitation, anterolateral and inferoapical hypokinesis LVEF ~45% .
Coronary angiography: [**2136-12-27**] Right dominant LMCA Normal LAD 70% ulcerated stenosis with TIMI 3 flow, D1 is TO LCX ulcerated thrombotic stenosis in the distal LCX with TIMI 2 flow RCA normal .
Echocardiogram: [**2136-12-20**] 1.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are  normal (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the posterior and lateral walls.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-12-20**], posterior and lateral hypokinesis now present.
Imaging: CT CHEST, W&W/O CONTRAST ([**2136-12-15**]): There is a 4.8 x 2.8 cm consolidative opacity within the left upper lobe with surrounding nodularity and ground-glass opacity, as described above.
Neoplasm is also on the differential, and followup evaluation should be obtained after treatment to evaluate for resolution.
PATHOLOGY: BRAIN BIOPSY [**2137-1-4**] Encephalitis, chronic, mild.
NOTE: This brain biopsy includes neocortex and a small amount of underlying subcortical white matter.
The acid fast stain is negative for bacilli and the GMS silver stain lacks fungi or yeast forms.
The tissue gram stain shows infrequent gram-positive cocci scattered over the tissue, sometimes near sites of pathology and sometimes in otherwise normal brain.
While the lack of secondary tissue changes to many of these organisms suggests they may be a staining contaminant, the culture prepared from this same brain tissue did grow rare coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
The pt initially presented to the Ed with complaints of chest pain, underwent a cardiac workup which revealed a postero-lateral STEMI.
the pt underwent a cardiac catheterization with POBA to left circumflex.
He was transferred to the medicine team for evaluation of the brain mass.
The pt underwent a brain biopsy which revealed no evidence of lymphoma or focal infection.
The brain biopsy was significant for some gram positive cocci which were thought to be a contaminant.
He presented with acute onset chest pain and was noted to have inferolateral ST elevations with a CK peak of 5864, MB>500 and Troponin-T of 9.83.
His cardiac cath revealed a right dominant circulation with two vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right heart filling pressure and moderately elevated left heart filling pressure (RVEDP 15 mmHg, LVEDP 26 mmHg, mean PCWP 20 mmHg).
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection but embolization in a small branch of the OM.
In the post-cath period the pt developed repeat episode of chest pain, described as "sharp", "14/10" and focal over cardiac apex.
His EKG was without change from previous with exception of V1 with T-wave flattening/inversion.
The pt was noted to have one subsequent episode of chest pain on the day of the brain biopsy which was not associated with any new or acute EKG changes (unchanged compared to previous).
CARDIAC: PUMP The pt was noted to have an ejection fraction of 40-50% on ECHO and 45% on cardiac catheterization.
RENAL: The pt has a baseline creatinine of 0.6-0.9 and the pt continued to be in this range during the hospitalization.
LEUKOCYTOSIS: The pt was noted to have an elevated white count of 24.3 but no bands or fever on admission.
The WBC count decreased to within normal limits on subsequent lab readings the same day and it was thought that the pt may have had transient leukocytosis secondary to acute MI.
He had the following counts: Absolute CD4 (342), absolute CD8 (967) and a CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.4.
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: The pt was noted to have a CXR significant for a worsening of consolidation in the left upper lobe with cavitation.
It was thought that this may represent worsening of pneumonia or a hemorrhage from a recent biopsy (which showed no aspergillus or fungal elements).
The was placed on TB precautions until TB was ruled out with acid fast smears from induced sputum and a bronchoalveolar lavage which revealed Pneumocystis Carinii on immunofluorescence testing.
The pt also underwent testing for Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test in which no respiratory viral antigens were detected.
However, the culture confirmation was pending at the time of discharge and will need to be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7991**].
The following laboratory tests were pending at the time of discharge and will need to be followed as an out-patient: induced sputum AFB culture, AFB culture (brain biopsy) and CSF acid-fast bacillus.
The pt underwent a planned brain biopsy which showed no diagnostic Toxoplasma gondii or multinucleated cells, scattered gram-positive cocci isolated and in pairs, not directly associated with microglial nodules (the nodules lacked multinucleated cells that would be diagnostic for HIV encephalitis), the acid fast stain was negative for bacilli and the GMS silver stain lacked fungi or yeast forms, tissue gram stain showed infrequent gram-positive cocci scattered over the tissue, sometimes near sites of pathology and sometimes in otherwise normal brain.
While the lack of secondary tissue changes to many of these organisms suggested they may be a staining contaminant, the culture prepared from this same brain tissue did grow rare coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
After discussion with the Attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the infectious diseases team, it was thought that the coag negative Staph likely represented a contamination (especially in light of a delay between collection and processing of the brain biopsy specimen).
No treatment was indicated based on clinical correlation (no mental status changes, no signs of meningitis or clinical signs of infection).The pt was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7991**] who will discuss the final results of the biopsy (brain) and pending microbiology studies.
