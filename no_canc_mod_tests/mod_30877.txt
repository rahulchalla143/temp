On examination at [**Location (un) 620**], he was felt to have an expressive aphasia and noted a right extensor plantar and right side horizontal nystagmus.
Follow up MRI showed multi-focal white matter hyperintensities and pachymeningeal enhancement (done post-LP).
Denies left arm pain but on examination this was somwhat limited by this.
GCS E4 V4 M6.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema or isc pallor although was limited by signficant nystagmus.

MRI C- AND T-SPINE [**2148-12-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
LP showed 5 WBC and Pr markedly elevated at 203.
On examination very poor memory and attention confused with a frontal affect, dysmetric, unsteady on feet with right sided hearing loss.
At initial assessment at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], patient had an LP which showed 5 WBC (lymphhocyte predominant), glucose 59, total protein significantly elevated at 231.6.
MRI of the C and T spine showed no demyelinating lesions and given the DWI findings suggestive of a possible vasculopathy/vasculitis in the presence of hearing loss, ophthalmology review was sought to rule out Susac's syndrome.
Opthalmology examined the patient and found a branch retinal artery occlusion in the right eye and after repeat MRI showed new DWI bright lesions this met the criteria for Susac's syndrome a rare condition otherwise known as Retinocochleocerebral Vasculopathy.
His examination slowly improved and he was started on a 5 day course of IVIg on [**12-13**].
EEG showed encephalopathy and no seizures.
His HTLV [**12-31**] were also negative.
As above, his acyclovir was stopped when his HSV PCR returned negative.
# OPTHO: Pt was noted on optho exam to have a branch retinal artery occlusion.
# CVS: while here, pt was monitored on telemetry but no arrythmias were noted.
- he was also noted to have downtrending platelets which should be trended for now  Medications on Admission: Medications: (home meds) AZITHROMYCIN - 250 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day take 2 today MECLIZINE [ANTIVERT] - 25 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth at bedtime .
