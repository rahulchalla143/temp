He had been feeling fatigued/lethargic as per his wife but with was in his usual state of cardiac health (able to walk [**1-27**]-mile without chest pain or shortness of breath; no orthopnea, no PND, no peripheral edema) until sunday evening around 3AM when he awoke with dyspnea and substernal chest pressure that felt like an "[**Location (un) 2452**] stuck in his chest."
He ignored his chest discomfort for several hours and decided the next morning to visit his PCP who sent him via ambulance to [**Hospital6 **] at 1:30pm.
At NWH his EKG revealed lateral ST depressions and his CK was positive at 660, Trop 8.8.
His initial vital signs were P 74, BP 123/60, RR 28, T 100.2 axillary, 95% on RA.
CXR showed mild CHF and later he was placed on 100%NRB for hypoxia and given 40mg IV lasix without response.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
His platelets were noted to be 100 down from a baseline of 250 and Hct of 25 down from a baseline of 30. .

EKG on presentation to CCU: NSR with TW flattening in all axial leads, 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depression and TWI in V4-V6.
CXR [**2111-8-24**]: Mild cardiomegaly with increased moderate congestive heart failure and increased left lower lobe atelectasis.
RUQ US [**2111-8-24**]: mild GB wall edema, with mild GB wall edema of 3mm, GB distension w/o stones or sludge.
ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Compared to the prior study (images reviewed) dated [**2111-1-27**], the overall LVEF has decreased and the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow (see ptca comments).
#NSTEMI Patient presented w/ ekg changes concerning for laternal infarct, CK peak of 614, Troponins-T peak 2.09, in setting of severe CAD history.
Cardiac cath revealed in-stent stenosis of LCX treated with balloon angioplasty.
Initial wbc, fever, and abdominal pain resolved w/ perc chole tube and Zosyn x 7 days.
After diuresis, ambulation, and repositioning, patient was weaned from O2.
Patient has no known history of lung disease, however exam was positive for wheezing which responded to albuterol and atrovent nebulization.
No evidence of HIT as platelets were low prior to starting heparin.
Smear showed 1+ schistocytes.
# Renal Baseline creatinine 1.1, with peak of 1.9 during admission likely [**2-27**] poor cardiac output.
Creatinine trended down toward baseline upon discharge.

You had a cardiac catheterization and balloon angioplasty to open up the stent in your artery which was blocked.
Please follow-up with hematology-oncology to follow-up on low blood count and low platelets.
