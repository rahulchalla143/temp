He was brought to the Emergency Department, and his fingerstick blood glucose was 28, he was subsequently given D50 and was discharged home after correction of hypoglycemia, with recommendations to decrease his insulin dose.
He was brought back to [**Hospital6 1760**], and a fingerstick was found to be 43.
He received one ampule of D50, and his blood sugar increased to 116.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed temperature 99.6, pulse 102, blood pressure 149/55, oxygen saturation 100% on ventilation mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils equal, round and reactive to light, eyes are moving, oropharynx with blood in the mouth, no icterus.
Abdomen, soft, mild distention, positive bowel sounds, no point tenderness.
Funduscopy revealed sharp disc margins bilaterally.
Deep tendon reflexes are positive on the left upper extremity as well as the right upper extremity.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count is 18, hematocrit 32, platelets 257, PTT 26, INR 1.3, sodium 129, potassium 6.3, chloride 189, bicarbonate 16, BUN 173, creatinine 20.5, glucose 93.
Urinalysis, specific gravity 1.014, large blood, trace leukocyte esterase, negative nitrates, positive protein, glucose 1000, trace ketones, red blood cells greater than 50, white blood cells 3 to 5, moderate bacteria, squamous epithelial cells 0-2.
Chest x-ray within normal limits.
Given his good urine output after the Foley catheter was placed (2 liters drained), it seems that the patient's acute renal failure is secondary to obstruction, likely related to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.
An electroencephalogram was done to evaluate for possible seizure activity, and the electroencephalogram revealed widespread and moderately severe encephalopathic conduction, affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
In addition, a computerized tomography scan of the head was done to rule out any acute intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage.
Computerized tomography scan of the head revealed no parenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage.
There was a question whether there was an ischemic episode, so an magnetic resonance imaging scan/magnetic resonance angiography of the head was performed, which showed probable chronic microvascular infarction of the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
Secondary to the electroencephalogram, computerized tomography scan of the head and magnetic resonance imaging scan being negative for pathology, it is presumed the patient's mental status is secondary to his toxic metabolic encephalopathy secondary to uremia as well as to the hypoglycemia.
Portable chest x-ray obtained on admission showed normal pulmonary vascularity, no evidence of failure.
A repeat chest x-ray also showed atelectasis within the left lung base, and lung parenchyma unchanged in appearance.
Admission BUN and creatinine were 173 and 20.5.
After the Foley catheter was placed, and 2 liters of urine were drained out, his BUN and creatinine were checked daily.
These decreased from 173/20.5 at 10 AM on admission subsequently to a BUN of 130 and creatinine of 10.9 at 8:30 PM on the same day, the day of admission.
His electrolytes were checked, and on hospital day #2 his creatinine further decreased to 4.2.
On hospital day #4, his BUN was 25, creatinine 1.5.
These continued to decrease to a low on [**2125-3-18**] of BUN 15, creatinine 0.8.
From [**2125-3-23**] to [**2125-3-21**], his BUN has stayed between 16 and 17, but his creatinine has fluctuated between 0.8 to 1.4.
A renal ultrasound was obtained to evaluate the patient's cause of renal failure.
A PSA was drawn, which revealed a level of 30.8.
The patient renal team followed the patient throughout this admission, and felt that the patient's BUN and creatinine were dramatically decreasing, and had excellent chance for recovery.
A voiding trial was attempted on hospital day #8, and the Foley catheter was removed early in the morning.
Urology evaluation and recommendations include discharge the patient with a Foley catheter in place for at least two weeks.
Urology consult felt that since the renal ultrasound was done after the Foley catheter was placed for bladder outlet obstruction (with return of 2 liters of fluid) that one would not expect to see hydronephrosis after the Foley catheter had been placed for acute renal failure secondary to bladder outlet obstruction.
The Urology service would not recommend ordering magnetic resonance imaging scan/ magnetic resonance angiography or rechecking the PSA in SICU setting.
Though the renal ultrasound, however, was done after the Foley catheter was placed with drainage of the latter.
As the patient is unable to cooperate with magnetic resonance imaging scan while an inpatient, the examination of an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the pelvis/abdomen of Mr. [**Known lastname **] to evaluate the retroperitoneal fibrosis will be deferred to the patient's primary care physician as well as outpatient urologist.
magnetic resonance imaging scan in two to three weeks after discharge.
Cardiovascular - The patient's electrocardiogram on admission was tachycardiac, with ST depressions bilaterally V4 through V6.
As these subsequently resolved, and the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of cardiac enzymes, there was no evidence of ischemic damage.
Endocrine - Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, the patient's home dose of insulin is specifically Humulin/NPH 40 units q. h.s.
On the day of discharge, the patient's blood sugars have been in the upper 200 range with NPH dose of 9 b.i.d.
Infectious disease - The patient was admitted with a white blood cell count of 18 and after the Foley catheter had dark chocolate-colored urine was drained, there was question of urinary tract infection as well.
On the day of discharge the patient's white blood cell count is 11.6.
The patient was on ventilation support for two days, and chest x-rays were sequentially checked, which were all clear.
Nutrition - A speech and swallow examination was performed on the patient, to evaluate his ability to take p.o.
On the initial speech and swallow examination on [**2125-3-16**], the patient had tongue deviated to the left and was unable to protrude his tongue and even maintain protrusion for a short amount of time.
There was also evaluation which felt that the patient did not have a swallow deficit per se, but rather he was unable to recognize the purpose, schema of eating at this time secondary to confusion.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Afebrile, blood pressure 136 to 158/70 to 84, pulse 54 to 84, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
The patient should have a voiding trial at this point in time and evaluation of benign prostatic hypertrophy.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 48788**] at [**Hospital3 2358**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 48791**]) on Wednesday, [**2125-4-4**] at 11:45 AM.
[**Last Name (STitle) 48789**], for a pelvic/abdominal magnetic resonance imaging scan in two to three weeks to assess the retroperitoneal fibrosis (the patient is unable to cooperate for magnetic resonance imaging scan while inpatient).
NPH insulin 9 units subcutaneously b.i.d., this dose may be increased as needed to maintain adequate fingerstick blood glucose 13.
If his creatinine decreases to within normal range, defer to primary care physician to restart Lisinopril as an outpatient.
