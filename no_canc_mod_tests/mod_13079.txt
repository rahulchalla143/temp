Of note, the patient was recently hospitalized in [**2183-5-20**] for E coli and K. pneumo UTI ([**1-17**] BCx + for K. pneumo), tx with cephalexin/cefpodoxime for 14d.
Her osteomyelitis was unchanged per MRI at this time.
The PICC was kept until f/u urine studies could be performed 1 wk post-abx.
Her vitals at this time were T 100.0 BP 160/90 AR 130 RR 30 O2 sat 90% RA.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 99.1 Tmax 101.8 BP 120/80 AR 92 RR 16 O2 sat 99% RA.

Urine cx ([**8-15**]): negative Blood cx ([**8-14**]): negative x2 Blood cx ([**8-15**]): NGTD x2 Cdiff toxin neg x1 .
CT abd/pelvis ([**8-14**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI pelvis ([**8-18**]): IMPRESSION: 1) Severely limited study for reasons stated above.
MRI T/L spine ([**8-17**]): Impression: Essentially no change in the appearance of the inflammatory changes at L2-L3.
Urine culture grew E coli and Klebsiella, sensitive to meropenem and bactrim.
MRI T/L spine showed stable appearance, so daptomycin was stopped on [**8-18**].
MRI pelvis was attempted, but pt did not tolerate due to claustrophobia (even with ativan).
Her sutures came loose on [**8-16**], but were reattached by IR.
Plain film w/ contrast showed proper positioning, so feeds resumed.
