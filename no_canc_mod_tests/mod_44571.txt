The morning of [**3-31**] he was found unresponsive at home by his father, per EMS report at that time his blood sugar was 180 and he was given narcan with no response.
He was then taken to [**State 44256**], in the ER there he was intubated for airway protection and initially started on propofol, he was presumed to have severe hepatic encephalopathy, with an ammonia level of 560.
A head CT head done on admission was negative for any acute process, his labs were notable for a Cr of 1.5, his chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, urine tox screen was positive for marijuana only.
His INR was elevated to 1.9 from 1.4, t-bili was 1.6, albumin improved from 2.0 to 3.4 after replacement.
During his course at [**State 44256**], he was started on lactulose and rifaximin to treat hepatic encephalopathy, on [**4-1**] he put out over 4L of stool.
He had an ultrasound of his abdomen with dopplers that was a significantly limited study that showed patent vessels, cirrhotic liver, but without identification of the main portal vein and hepatic veins, along with moderate ascites.
A KUB showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, multiple chest x-rays without any evidence of pneumonia, just stable airspace disease at the left base.
A CT of his head and c-spine did not show any acute process.
Currently, the etiology of his obtundation is thought to be hepatic encephalopathy and has had prior episodes of decompensation with noncompliance with his lactulose, which his family does admit happens fairly often.
On arrival to the MICU, his initial VS were: 99.8, 72, 163/44, 14, 100% on PSV 5/5, 40% FiO2.
Of note, his blood sugars are more controlled now on the same oral antidiabetic agents.
