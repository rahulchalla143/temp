The infant required no phototherapy and the bilirubin level resolved with the most recent bilirubin level of 12.8 over 0.5 on [**2174-7-15**].
Hematocrit at birth was 51.8 with a platelet count of 383.

A repeat EEG was done on        [**2174-7-11**] and showed subtle changes with a more        continuous background but with continued excessive        bitemporal spikes.
A MRI done on [**2174-7-5**] showed a dysgenic brain -        cerebral underdevelopment, underdevelopment of the        anterior operculum, and simplified frontal gyria        (bitemporal perisylvian/ bifrontal polymicrogyria-        pachygyria)    4.
A lactate on [**2174-7-4**] was 2.3.
Serum pyruvate on [**2174-7-4**] was 0.18.
Glucose 61 on [**2174-7-4**].

The ALT        was 7, AST 22, CPK 169, alkaline phosphatase 111,    8.
Ammonia on [**2174-7-4**] was 52, and 63 on [**2174-7-8**].
Arterial blood gases were within normal limits.
Uric acid on [**2174-7-12**] was 1.6 which is low.
Urine        thosulfate levels are pending.
Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was sent on [**2174-7-4**].
The        cell count was normal with a white blood cell count of        2 and one red blood cell with a normal differential.
Glucose of 31, protein 85, lactate 12.5, pyruvate 0.3,        amino acids normal.
Neuro transmitter metabolites were sent from the CSF on        [**2174-7-5**] and those were normal.
Urine toxicology was normal on [**2174-7-3**].
Urine for organic acids on [**2174-7-4**] were normal.
The infant had a 3 day trial of PO Pyridoxine (100mg) which did not change her neurological exam and presentation.
Chromosomes were sent and the chromosomes came back as normal, 46XX.
No further genetic evaluations have been recommended.
Sensory: Audiology: Hearing screen was performed with automated auditory brain stem responses and the infant referred in both ears on [**2174-7-10**].
Drs [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73540**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2411**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8494**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 73541**]) 2.
