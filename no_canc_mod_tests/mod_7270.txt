PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 78, his blood pressure was 126/65, his respiratory rate was 22, and his oxygen saturation was 99% on 60% of FIO2 .
Central venous pressure was 12.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the neck was supple.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed 1+ lower extremity edema.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was alert and oriented.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data on admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 15, his hematocrit was 33.2, and his platelets was 121.
His INR was 1.2.
Sodium was 138, potassium was 4, chloride was 97, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 69, creatinine was 4, and his blood glucose was 290.
His magnesium was 1.8, his phosphorous was 2.8, and his calcium was 9.6.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed asymmetric pulmonary edema.
A renal ultrasound of the transplanted kidney showed no evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection, resistive indices were between 0.51 and 0.67.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's baseline creatinine was approximately 2.
The patient had a peak creatinine on this admission of 4.2.
The patient underwent a renal biopsy on [**2-6**] and had his immunosuppression decreased slightly with a reduction in his CellCept from 1000 mg twice per day to 500 mg twice per day.
The patient is followed by the [**Hospital 10701**] Clinic, and his biopsy results will be followed up as an outpatient.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient has severe mitral regurgitation with a normal ejection fraction and was thought to have flash pulmonary edema with his rapid atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with heart rates in the 130s to 140s.
During this hospitalization, the patient had thyroid function tests checked which revealed a mildly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone of 5.2.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND ATRIAL FLUTTER ISSUES:  On the day of discharge, the patient had a normal sinus rhythm with his rate well controlled in the 70s.
Therefore, a colonoscopy and possible endoscopy were recommended if there is concern over possible gastrointestinal bleeding with the initiation of anticoagulation therapy.
A lower extremity noninvasive Doppler study was performed on his right lower extremity to rule out deep venous thrombosis.
