Chest CT [**2166-3-1**]: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo F with severe COPD, HTN, and recent admission for lingular PNA with workup concerning for multiple pulmonary nodules and possible malignancy presents as a transfer from the medical [**Hospital1 **] immediately after ED admission with hypotension and hypoxia.
# Hypoxia: Resolved on transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**12-23**] Recurrent Lingular Pneumonia - Recent CT chest from [**12-30**] showing multiple b/l pulm nodules concerning for mets without found primary lesion raising suspicion for post-obstructive PNA vs. infiltrate from malginancy.
As she quickly clinically improved her vancomycin was stopped and chest CT showed almost complete resolution of multiple pulmonary nodules seen in [**12-30**], which indicated a likely infectious etiology.
This was discussed with her outpatient pulmonologist, and no further followup is needed at this time.
# COPD, severe - 40 pack year smoking history, quit [**7-29**], with severe centrilobular emphysematous changes on most recent CT. Was not started on steroids given concern for acute PNA, and repeat chest CT showed resolution of previously seen nodules as well as mild volume overload, treated as above.
# Hypotension: Floor team unable to obtain SBP >60/palp in the absence of obtundation despite 4L NS.
Her blood pressure remained stable thereafter, and repeat lactate was decreased to 1.8.
Home BP meds were initially held but restarted for afib with RVR as above, and her pressures remained stable afterwards.
Patient appeared volume depleted on exam on admission.
Iron studies from [**12-30**] consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
Your heart rate was found to be very high and we started you on a medication called diltiazem for this.
