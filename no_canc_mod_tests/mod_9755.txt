Medical workup at that time included a negative RPR, normal thyroid function tests, and a head MRI showing possible chronic microvascular ischemia.
The second operation included a posterior fusion of T9 to L3, multiple thoracolumbar laminectomies, segmental instrumentation of T9 to L3, and right iliac crest graft.
She complained of sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath with oxygen saturations dropping to 70%, blood pressure dropping to 70/40.
She was intubated immediately, and transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Progressive loss of bilateral translucency on chest x-ray and positive anti-HLA and anti-granulocyte antibodies on hematological workup were all consistent with TRALI (transfusion-associated lung injury).
While in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, her postoperative course was further complicated with methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, pneumonia, and wound infection (which were documented with positive cultures on [**7-17**]).
After she was started on intravenous oxacillin on [**7-20**], she had very good response, with decreased fever and decreased white blood cell count, as well as clearing of bacteremia which was documented by several blood cultures drawn on later days.
Wound cultures showed decreased colonization of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and rare colonies of E. coli.
She also had a diagnostic pleural tap on [**7-26**] for persistent left pleural effusion.
The final culture was negative.
She had repeated TTE on [**7-22**] which showed no vegetation and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.
She also had a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis on [**7-25**], which showed improving effusion and normal bowels with old splenic infarct.
CT angio was also performed, which showed improving atelectasis and effusion without evidence of pulmonary emboli.

Two recent blood cultures on [**7-22**] and [**7-27**] were negative.
Urine culture on [**7-22**] and [**7-27**] were negative.
Wound culture on [**7-23**] showed decreased methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus.
Stool cultures were negative for C. difficile.
Catheter tip culture on [**7-25**] was negative.
Chest x-ray on [**7-26**] showed decreased left pleural effusion without pneumothorax, decreased congestive heart failure, persistent left basilar atelectasis.
CT on [**7-25**] showed an old splenic infarct, no abnormal bowel or liver or fluid collection.
CT angio showed no evidence of pulmonary emboli, increased left pleural effusion, ground-glass attenuation consistent with volume overload.
TTE:  Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%, small pericardial effusion.
Pleural tap showed no malignant cells.
So far, all blood cultures drawn after starting oxacillin were negative to date.
Repeated chest x-ray showed improving atelectasis.
Repeated CTA revealed no evidence of pulmonary emboli.
Given her questionable history of alcohol abuse and poor nutritional status currently, vitamin B12 and folate and thiamine and a multivitamin were given as supplements.
A head CT revealed age-inappropriate atrophy such as seen in increased risk for dementia.
Psychotic disorder, unspecified  DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Wear thoracolumbar brace for three months when out of bed.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Oxacillin 2 grams every four hours intravenously for a total of six weeks (until [**8-31**]), Haldol 2 mg every morning and 2 mg daily at bedtime, Trazodone 50 mg daily at bedtime, Lopressor 100 mg twice a day and hold for systolic pressure less than 100 or heart rate less than 60, multivitamin one tablet once daily.
