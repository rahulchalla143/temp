CPR was initiated at the NH, she was intubated in the field and given atropine x2 and epi x 4 enroute to OSH.
After more CPR and epi, dopa, calcium gluconate, and bicarb the pt returned to a sinus tach with perfusion.
CT of the chest showed a large almost saddle right sided PE with multiple small right PEs.
ABG at 19:55 had a ph of 7.04. .
Upon arrival in the MICU, she had a BP in 80s, that then declined to the 50s.
ABG showed pH still at 7.01 and PO2 of 40, so bicarb was restarted.

**FINAL REPORT [**2130-1-27**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2130-1-27**]):       GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
Blood Cultures: Pending  Studies: The current study demonstrates the right chest tube in place with no apparent right pneumothorax, although small pneumothorax can be obscured by significant amount of subcutaneous air.
CE at the OSH and her CK here are elevated, likely secondary to her CPR, but ischemia can not be excluded.
Her head CT at [**Hospital1 **] had no significant findings, but was likely too soon after her event to show anoxic injury.
CXR with decreasing pneumo.
Further Pneumothorax noted on the left surronding the aortic arch.
