In addition, there is a slightly distracted (1.5 mm distraction) small (3.2 mm) fracture fragment arising from the triquetrum, which could be acute (series 402B, image 13).
Please note that assessment of soft tissue structures by CT scan is limited.
If there is a specific clinical concern, then further evaluation with MRI or ultrasound could be considered, depending on the clinical question.
