[**2156-11-28**] CTA chest - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2156-11-30**] TTE - The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2156-11-30**] Abdominal Ultrasound - IMPRESSION: 1.
Ill-defined density in the upper third of the right kidney, for which further imaging is recommended.
[**2156-12-1**] CT abdomen & pelvis with contrast - IMPRESSION: No acute intra-abdominal pathology to explain patient's chest pain.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal.
[**2156-12-6**] CT abdomen & pelvis without contrast - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2156-12-6**] Right hand x-ray - There are no signs for acute fractures or dislocation.
[**2156-12-14**] CT head without contrast - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology including no hemorrhage.
[**2156-12-15**] EEG - FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording the background rhythm was a [**1-24**] Hz rapid pattern with an anterior predominance but generalized distribution.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were frequent bursts of generalized delta slowing.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
PE and ischemia were ruled out as causes of her chest pain, however, her hospital course was complicated by an episode of hypercarbic respiratory failure and an episode of respiratory alkalemia, both requiring intubation.
A thorough history and physical exam, EKG, Cardiac Enzymes, Echocardiogaphy (TTE & TEE), breast discharge cultures, blood cultures, chest x-rays, CT scan, Abdominal ultrasound and CT failed to discover an organic etiology of her pain.
A comprehensive review of outside hospital records from [**Hospital3 **], Caritas [**Hospital3 **], Caritas [**Hospital 28941**], and [**Hospital6 **] indicated that the patient has chronically complained of unexplained chest pain in the past 6 months.
Given her history of upper extremity DVTs we maintained her on a heparin drip until her INR returned to the therapeutic range.
No evidence of DVT was found via D-dimer or on CT scan.
Her blood cultures remained negative while admitted.
A hand x-ray confirmed dislocation.
The patient was placed on 2L NC with pulse oximetry monitoring.
Her eyes were deviated downward and an ABG revealed a respiratory alkalosis.
The patient was reintubated and her blood gases normalized.
She had a head CT that showed no intranial bleeding or acute abnormality.
To maintain her oxygen saturation and prevent hypercarbia, the patient must wear BiPAP or CPAP mask while sleeping.
Her settings on discharge with a nasal BiPAP mask were inspiratory pressure 16, expiratory pressure 6 with 12 L O2 to keep O2 sats >88%.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Please hold on [**2156-12-16**] and monitor INR before resuming this medication.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: 1) Bipolar disorder 2) Borderline personality disorder 3) MRSA Bacteremia 4) Hypercarbic respiratory failure 5) Respiratory alkalosis 6) Right phalangeal dislocation, s/p reduction & splinting  Secondary Diagnoses: 1) Hyperprolactinemia 2) Hypertension 3) History of DVTs   Discharge Condition: Stable, maintains O2 sats >88% on room air while awake, requires supplemental O2 by BiPAP or CPAP while sleeping.
Discharge Instructions: You have been admitted to the hospital with chest pain and for a blood infection.
We performed extensive testing but were unable to determine a cause for your chest pain.
