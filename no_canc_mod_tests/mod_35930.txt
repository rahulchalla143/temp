Examination of the lungs revealed clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Examination of the heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs.
The patient's abdomen revealed a soft, nontender, and nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.
Examination of her wounds revealed they were clean, dry, and intact and well healed.
Examination of the legs revealed no edema.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Transplant Surgery Service, laboratories were sent, and a computed tomography was obtained to evaluate thrombosis of the hepatic artery, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography drains were opened.
On hospital day one, the patient was tremulous, and the patient's systolic blood pressure was down to 95 to 100, and her oxygenation was down to 92% to 94% on room air.
At this time, a computed tomography revealed that the patient had a thrombosed hepatic artery and the transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were markedly elevated.
Considering the fact that the hepatic artery was completely thrombosed and that the patient's liver function tests were markedly elevated, the clinical picture at this time was consistent with liver failure.
A blood culture and urine culture were sent on admission.
The patient was sent to the Intensive Care Unit where the patient was put on linezolid, Zosyn, Bactrim, and fluconazole for a temperature of 101.8.
The patient's alanine-aminotransferase on presentation was 803, her aspartate aminotransferase was 1022, her alkaline phosphatase was 502, and the patient's total bilirubin was 9.2.
The patient's alanine-aminotransferase decreased to 378, aspartate aminotransferase decreased to 192, and her alkaline phosphatase decreased to 220.
An ultrasound showed that the portal vein was patent.
While there was no arterial flow, a chest x-ray did not show any acute process.
A computed tomography of the abdomen was read as having a heterogeneous hypoattenuation of the left lobe of the liver, a new foci of air level in the right area of the infarction, and thrombosis in the hepatic artery.
The patient's white count improved as well.
The patient's transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin also improved throughout the day.
A chest x-ray showed a possible left lower lobe infiltrate.
On hospital day six, the patient continued to have high temperatures up to 103.1 and a low temperature of 92.6.
The patient's transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin all improved dramatically compared to the prior day.
