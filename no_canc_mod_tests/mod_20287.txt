[**2199-6-16**] CXR As compared to the previous radiograph, there is little change in comparison to the prior study.
The monitoring and support devices are constant.
[**2199-6-17**] EEG This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of a mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
[**2199-6-17**] CXR As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slightly different distribution of the extensive bilateral pleural effusions with accompanying atelectasis.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**2199-6-19**] CXR Cardiomegaly is stable.
[**2199-6-20**] CXR The ET tube tip is 3.5 cm above the carina.
Heart size and mediastinum appears to be unchanged including mild cardiomegaly and potentially prominence of the main pulmonary artery, consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
[**2199-6-20**] CT TORSO 1.
Heterogeneously enhancing left renal lesion, probably an angiomyolipoma, but further evaluation with non-urgent MRI is recommended  [**2199-6-24**] Portable Abdomen X-ray A gastrostomy tube projects over the left upper quadrant; exact placement is indeterminate on this study.
[**2199-6-24**] CXR In comparison with the study of [**6-24**], there is little interval change.

[**2199-6-26**] CT Head: 8mm left parietal hygroma, final read pending at time of discharge but imaging reviewed with neurosurgical attending     Brief Hospital Course: This ia a 72F admitted to Neurosurgery for monitoring.
On [**6-7**] eve she c/o R shoulder and chest pain, a shoulder xray was negative but suggested a clavicle fracture.
A repeat head CT was stable.
Lopressor IV was again given, cardiology was consulted, labs were checked and potassium and phos were repleted.
HSe had an EEG which showed active seizures, Keppra was given as was ativan and she was transferred to teh ICU.
She had a NCHCT which was stable, her Keppra was increased, and Dilantin was started in addition per consult from neruology.
She was subsequently intubated, arterial and central lines were placed, and she had blood cultures, a bronchal lavage, and urine cultures sent.
On 4.30 she was febrile to 101.3, cardiac enzymes continued to be trended, and her corrected dilantin level was 20.6.
A repeat head CT was unchanged from pervious.
Her exam remains unchaged and 24 hr EEG was negative for seizure activity.
On [**6-13**], The EEG which was consistent with an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of a diffuse encephalopathy of moderate to moderately severe quality.
As there were no seizures and the test was stable the EEG was discontinued.
The patient was febrile to 101.5 and sputum, blood, urine cultures were sent for culture.
A chest x ray wa performed which was consistent with increased opacity in the left perihilar region, worrisome for aspiration.
The patient was noted to be more lethargic on exam and a EEG ordered to rule out seizures.
The EEG was consistent with abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy.
The dilantin level corrected at 8.5 and phosphenytoin bolus of 500mg.
On [**6-16**], The patient's serum dilantin level was corrected at 10.
Given the patients prior seizures that patient was given a phisphenytpin bolus of 500 mg IV x 1 in an attempt to obtain a therapeutic dilantin level of 15.
An EEG continued and was consistent with abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of a moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy.
On [**6-17**], The EEG was consistent with no seizures.
On [**6-18**] her exam was slightly improved in that she was intermittently following commands with her RUE and RLE.
The Chest X ray was consistent with a , but with partially collapsed lung.
On [**6-26**] She had a head CT which showed an 8mm left parietal hygroma.
She received a bed offer from a vented rehab, was on trach mask, and discharged to rehab with instructions for followup  TRANSTIONAL CARE ISSUES: Heterogeneously enhancing left renal lesion, probably an angiomyolipoma noted on our imaging, so patient will need a non-urgent MRI for further evaluation.
