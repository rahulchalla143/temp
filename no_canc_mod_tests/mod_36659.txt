CT head [**2109-5-5**] IMPRESSION: 4.4 x 2.1 cm right basal ganglia hemorrhage exerting mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle, but no midline shift or herniation.
MRI could be performed for further evaluation.
Findings of this study were posted on the radiology department dashboard as an urgent finding.
CT head [**2109-5-6**] IMPRESSION: Hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia, with surrounding edema, effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and body of the right lateral ventricle, and minimal leftward shift of normally-midline structures.
The previous study is associated with a different MRN, [**Numeric Identifier 105251**], on PACS.)
CT head [**2109-5-7**] FINDINGS: There is a right basal ganglia hemorrhage measuring 4.4 x 2 cm (2:16), with surrounding vasogenic edema, with no significant interval change compared to recent CT.
CXR [**2109-5-5**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2109-5-7**] REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient with shortness of breath.
Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.
Overall, mediastinal contours are unremarkable except for slight distention of the azygos vein, but again may be attributed to the portable technique of the study and potentially some degree of volume overload.
Repeated radiograph is highly recommended, predominantly with upright technique for precise evaluation of the costophrenic areas bilaterally as well as the mediastinum.
Repeat CT scans were obtained on [**5-5**] and [**5-6**] and it did not show any change in the size of bleed.
The MRI scan did not show any left sided lesion.
The patient had a head CT which did not show any change, and EKG and cardiac enzymes were normal.
An EEG was obtained that was normal, however it was thought that this episode represented a seizure and he was started on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **].
Cards He was constantly monitered  on telemetry and EKG as well as cardiac enzymes were obtained and ruled out for myocardial ischemia.
Blood pressure was controlled tightly to less than 140/80.
Chest X ray did not show any evidence of infiltrates or pneumonia.
