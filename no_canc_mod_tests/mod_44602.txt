ECHO [**2164-3-26**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
TTE revealed very mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD and mild mitral regurgitation.
