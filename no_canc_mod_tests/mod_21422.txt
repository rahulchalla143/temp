On his initial examination, his temperature was 98.3; pulse was in the 1-teens to 130's.
His blood pressure was 88/53 and he was saturating 96 percent on room air.
He had a significant amount of jugulovenous distention and his heart sounds were distant.
His breath sounds were decreased in the lower lobes.
His initial white blood cell count was 20.1 with a hematocrit of 28.
His INR was markedly elevated at 6.0 and his BUN and creatinine were 34 and 1.6.
The patient's initial chest x-ray showed low lung volumes, ill-defined bibasilar opacities, which were thought to represent consolidation and presence of cardiomegaly.
Given his clinical scenario, it was felt prudent to obtain an echocardiogram to rule out tamponade or pericardial effusion, responsible for his hypotension and his acute renal insufficiency.
He did undergo this echocardiogram which revealed presence of significant pericardial effusion, although there was no evidence of pericardial tamponade.
Notably preoperatively, the patient had markedly elevated transaminases with an ALT of 1139 and an AST of 1415 with a normal total bilirubin and normal alkaline phosphatase, amylase and lipase.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained on our service and didn't show any evidence of biliary tract obstructions.
We initially held his Coumadin until his INR drifted back down towards 2.5.
By the time he was ready for discharge, though, his rate was controlled with a blood pressure in the 100/60's and rate of 80 to 90 and atrial fibrillation.
To note, the patient developed an increase in oxygen requirement towards the latter part of his hospitalization and chest x-ray showed accumulation of a large right pleural effusion.
By the time of his discharge, his liver function tests had normalized and his white blood cell count had normalized to 8.8.
To note, his hematocrit was 36.4 and his INR was 3.0.
His renal function had normalized to its baseline with BUN and creatinine of 22 and 0.9.
His transaminase, as noted, had normalized and his chest x-ray showed the presence of no significant effusion and he only had small apical pneumothoraces which had been stable.
To note, he was treated empirically with Vancomycin and levofloxacin throughout his hospitalization for the question of infection of his pericardial effusion, given that his white blood cell count was elevated.
This was discontinued prior to his discharge as none of his culture data showed any growth.
Coumadin as directed for a goal INR of 3 to 3.5.
FOLLOW UP:  He was to follow up in Dr.[**Name (NI) 57924**] clinic on the following day for INR check.
