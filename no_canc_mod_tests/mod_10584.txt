CT scan was negative for hemorrhage.
INR was 1.4.
Since arrival at [**Hospital1 69**] the blood pressure has been stable around 120s to 170s.
He had a total knee replacement on [**2177-2-19**] and it was during his preoperative evaluation for this that the atrial fibrillation was noted.
Blood pressure was 131/70 mmHg.
Heart rate was 94 per minute and respiratory rate was 17 per minute.
CARDIAC:   Cardiac examination revealed regular rate and rhythm without any clicks or murmurs.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well perfused with positive pulses and brisk capillary refill without edema.
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the left upper extremity and knee and absent on the right.
MR imaging of the brain revealed a large area of restrictive diffusion in the left frontal temporal parietal lobes consistent with a left MCA territory infarct on DWI series.
MRA of the brain revealed complete occlusion of the left M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 620**] is a 70-year-old gentleman with a large left MCA infarct after 30 hours after elective cardioversion for atrial fibrillation, was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 Neurology Service for further assessment and management of left MCA territory infarct.
Since he had a relatively large MCA territory infarct, his blood pressures were maintained between 140 to 160 mmHg and for blood pressures greater than 200/100 treatment is initiated with Lopressor 5 mg IV every six hours as needed.
Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed dilated left atrium; mild spontaneous echocontrast seen in the body of the left atrium; mild spontaneous echocontrast was seen in the left atrial appendage.
The ascending, transverse, and descending thoracic aorta were normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaques.
Echocardiogram repeated on [**2177-4-11**] did not show any significant changes from the previous study.
On admission, the initial troponin level was 13.3, and the creatinine phosphokinase level was 174 on [**2177-3-30**].
The second troponin level on [**2177-3-31**] at midnight was 10.7 and creatinine phosphokinase level was 144.
The third study of troponin on [**2177-3-31**] at 6 a.m. was 8.1 and creatinine phosphokinase MB was 1.0.
Creatinine phosphokinase level was 117.
The white blood cell count was 11.8, hemoglobin last labs are the following:  CBC.9, hematocrit 34.4, platelet count 240,000, PT 18.5, PTT 32.1, INR 2.4.
The CPK was 44 and troponin was 6.4.
Since the blood pressures could not be controlled with medical measures on the floor, he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for vasopressor [**Doctor Last Name 360**] administration and control of his homostasis.
During his stay at the ICU, the patient also had an elevated sodium of 155 for which he received free water boluses.
The CT scan revealed increasing edema and midline shift most probably secondary to hypotonic fluids, diffusing into the large stroke area.
he will also need a statin if his cholesterol levels are elevated at all.
