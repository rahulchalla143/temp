His weight was 238 pounds.
He had a good blood pressure at 110/80 but his pulse was 120 beats per minute.
Jugular venous pressure could not be assessed.
On chest examination, there were bibasilar rales.
On cardiac examination, apical impulse was diffuse, heart sounds were normal, there was a loud summation gallop.
Pulses were not easily palpable.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and left bundle branch block.
Echocardiogram showed an enlarged left atrium, dilated left ventricle with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 20%.
On the day of admission, hematocrit was 38.1, white blood cell count 9.6, platelet count 337,000, prothrombin time 19.2, INR 2.4, blood sugar 166, BUN 27, creatinine 1.1, sodium 132 and chloride 94.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction by CKs, but the plan was to take him for a cardiac catheterization when he was more stable and had been diuresed significantly.
On [**2197-9-12**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization and was referred to cardiothoracic surgery for evaluation.
On [**2197-9-12**], his white blood cell count was 8.2 with a hematocrit of 38.7, platelet count 288,000, prothrombin time 15.4, partial thromboplastin time 28.7, INR 1.6, sodium 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 93, bicarbonate 29, BUN 41, creatinine 1.4, and blood sugar 163.
He also noted a thick panniculus on his obese abdomen but no hepatosplenomegaly or masses detected.
He also noted that the left hand had an intact palmar arch on examination of the left radial artery, the patient is left handed, but there was a question of the intactness of his right palmar arch, as decisions for conduits needed to be made.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2197-9-14**]:  Left ventricular ejection fraction not calculated as no ventriculogram was done; left main had a 50% lesion, left anterior descending artery had a 90% lesion; circumflex 100% lesion and right coronary artery 100% occluded.
Index was only 1.7 at the time of examination, with pulmonary artery pressure of 57/34.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] recommended right leg vein mapping and getting a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate for mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction, and agreed to re-evaluate the patient when the studies were done.
Vein mapping showed below the knee lesser saphenous and greater saphenous to be patent.
Echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 15% with left ventricular dilatation, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricle with also dilated and depressed function.
He had put 4.9 liters out from his chest tubes.
His white blood cell count was 6.2, hematocrit 27, potassium 4.2, BUN 35, creatinine 1.6, blood sugar 236 and INR 1.5.
He was kept sedated with orders to continue transfusing him to a platelet count of about 100,000.
He was explored for mediastinal bleeding and returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit with his chest open.
His blood pressure was 95/65 with decreased urine output.
He had an output of 4.79 with an index of 2 on the following drips:  Amiodarone, Ativan, insulin, Levophed, milrinone, morphine and Neo-Synephrine at 3.5.
His creatinine rose to 2.2, his potassium was 5, BUN 14, white blood cell count 11, hematocrit 27.8, while he remained intubated and sedated on his drips, with attempts to wean his PEEP.
His hematocrit rose to 30 with a white blood cell count of 12 and he remained on drug support in the Intensive Care Unit.
On postoperative day number four, a repeat echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10% to 20% with poor wall motion.
He was somewhat hypotensive, with a blood pressure of 84 to 100 range.
His hematocrit was 29.6 but his white blood cell count rose to 13.1.
The patient continued to be aneuric and his oxygenation was becoming more difficult.
The patient became acidotic and his systemic vascular resistance was only 487 with a blood pressure of 90/50.
The patient's creatinine on [**2197-9-20**] was 3.1 to 4.8 with continuing acute renal failure.
His chest x-ray showed increased pleural effusion with a question of a pericardial effusion.
His potassium rose from 5 the day prior to 6.4.
