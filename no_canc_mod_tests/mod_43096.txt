On arrival in the Emergency Department, his blood pressure on the right side was noted to be 247/132 and on the left side was 214/127.
The patient then received labetalol 20 mg intravenously times two without resolution and was then started on a nitroprusside drip with a blood pressure initially at 247/140.
The patient was evaluated by the Medical Intensive Care Unit team and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a blood pressure of 170/119 on a Nipride drip.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed the patient's temperature was 95.4 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 82, his noninvasive blood pressure was 220/120, respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no rales.
Sensory examination was unremarkable.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  On laboratory examination, complete blood count was significant for a slightly elevated white blood cell count of 14.3.
His hematocrit was 48.7.
Chemistry panel revealed sodium was 133, potassium was 5.4, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen was 23, creatinine was 1.1, and blood glucose was 189.
Liver function tests revealed his alanine-aminotransferase was 16, aspartate aminotransferase 42, and his alkaline phosphatase was 95, amylase was 62, lipase was 25, and his total bilirubin was 0.9.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's blood pressure was well controlled on the Nipride drip.
However, several hours after he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit the patient's oxygen saturation began to decline precipitously.
On examination at that time, the patient had been developing diffuse rales bilaterally with an oxygen saturation dropping to the high 80s and low 90s despite 100% nonrebreather.
