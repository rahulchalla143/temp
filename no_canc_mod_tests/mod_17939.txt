There are opacities along the anterior thoracic spine which are similar and again consistent with large osteophytes.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: Again seen is a small left-sided subdural hematoma layering over the left temporoparietal convexity.
Further clinical surveillance and possibly repeat scan is recommended.

As before, the majority measures density similar to the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter, however, there remains a focal area of hyperdensity not significantly changed from the prior study and consistent with more acute re-hemorrhage into the hematoma.
Echo [**2119-2-13**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent  with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow  pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
TTE Echo on [**2119-2-13**] without right heart strain.
Repeat head CT on [**2119-2-12**] essentially unchanged showing unchanged left subdural hematoma with focal area of hyperdensity associated with hemorrhage which was seen on prior CT and unchanged.
Patient is scheduled for a repeat chest CT in [**2119-4-9**] and recommended to follow-up with his primary care physician.
# Left subdural hemotoma: Patient was seen by [**Year (4 digits) **] during this admission and they found that the hematoma was improving and repeat head CT demonstrated no interval change.
Patient scheduled for a repeat chest CT in [**2119-4-9**] and was instructed to follow-up with his primary care physician.
