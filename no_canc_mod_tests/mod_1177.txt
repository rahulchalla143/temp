He was referred to endocrinology for evaluation of central hypothyroidism.
He was also found to be anemia to Hct of 30 with his last checked Hct 41.6 six years prior with anemia labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease.

CT ABD/PEL [**2184-3-9**]: 1.
Small hypoattenuating renal lesions, too small to characterize by CT criteria.
VQ LUNG SCAN [**2184-3-11**]: IMPRESSION: Intermediate-level suspicion (30-40%) for PE.
CTA CHEST [**2184-3-12**]: 1.
Plasma cells are 3% of aspirate differential and 10-15% of marrow core biopsy cellularity by CD138 staining.
CT HEAD [**2184-3-13**] IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage, edema, or evidence of acute process.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2184-3-15**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2176-3-18**], posterior wall hypokinesis cannot be definitively identified.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended.
RIGHT TEMPORAL ARTERY BIOPSY [**2184-3-18**]: Temporal artery with intimal hyperplasia.
MRI Brain and Pituitary [**2184-3-21**] IMPRESSION: - Multiple punctate bifrontal and left parietal acute embolic infarcts, without significant mass effect or associated shift of midline structures.
The patient developed altered mental status during the admission; imaging of the head demonstrated multiple acute embolic infarcts.
A TTE/TEE showed no evidence of vegetations.
Repeat MRI brain was suggestive of watershed infarcts possibly sustained during cardiac arrest.
