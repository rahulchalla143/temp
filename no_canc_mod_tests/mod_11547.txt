A cardiac catheterization was performed at that time which revealed 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation with a small atrial septal defect, as well as no flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
She diuresed her while she was there, and then she was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.
An echocardiogram was performed on [**2179-11-16**]; at which time the ejection fraction was noted to be 55%.
She was discharged home, taken off of her Coumadin, and had been managed with Lovenox, and she was to be admitted with her date of admission on [**2179-11-22**] for a repeat cardiac catheterization with mitral valve surgery to follow the next day.
The patient's white blood cell count of 18.4, hematocrit was 30.6, and platelet count was 153.
Otherwise, electrolytes were stable.
Her vital signs were stable, and a junctional rhythm at 68, saturating at 94% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
White blood cell count was down to 18.1, hematocrit was down to 26.4, and the platelet count was 138.
Cardiology/Electrophysiology Service was consulted for the patient's persistent atrial fibrillation at which time they recommended to continue with beta blocker for now and Coumadin with an INR goal of 2 to 3.
Heart rate was 68.
Otherwise, vital signs were stable.
White blood cell count was 18.1.
Cardiology consulted with the patient again at that time; at which time they suggested intravenous heparin until her INR was greater than 2 with a goal of 2 to 3, to utilize a low-dose Lopressor for high heart rates (for example, greater than 80 to 90), and to maintain it for 24 hours if the beta blocker was started for bradycardia, and if the patient required beta blocker and became bradycardic the patient may need a pacemaker.
Otherwise, physical examination was unremarkable.
The plan was to discharge the patient when her INR was greater than 2, and to administer 5 mg of Coumadin today and then 2.5 mg of Coumadin.
INR at that time was 1.6.
The patient received a total of 7.5 mg of Coumadin the night prior, and the plan was to continue to monitor the patient's INR with a plan for discharge when INR was greater than 2.
INR was 2.4.
White blood cell count was 15, and hematocrit was 25.2, and a platelet count of 142.
(with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3).
Mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and atrial septal defect.
