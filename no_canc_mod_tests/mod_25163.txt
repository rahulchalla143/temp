At this point, attention was then directed to his right lower extremity which was redraped and prepped and the existing suture line on the popliteal wound which was adjacent to the others, 12 to 15 cm was removed.
All counts of sponges and instruments were correct.
I, therefore, proceeded to reduce the fracture with traction.
The vascular surgery service proceeded after the orthopedic intervention to perform an exploration and revascularization of the right lower extremity.
His urine culture grew out pan-sensitive ecoli and he was treated with Cipro.
Repeat head CTs were negative, and an MRI showed no cause for this mental status.
Approximately one week prior to discharge, sensation returned - in part - to patients RLE.
