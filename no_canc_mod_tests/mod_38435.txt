The hepatic arteries and veins are not assessed because the examination was ended earlier due to the patient's clinical status.
Vascular portion of the exam was otherwise incomplete, however, because of the patient's clinical status.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2197-7-28**]: LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-11-12**], the findings are similar.
LENI'S [**2197-7-28**]:  FINDINGS:  Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of bilateral common femoral, femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial veins.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 yo female PMH of NASH cirrhosis, s/p gastric  bypass presentes with tylenol OD resulting in transaminitis as well as elevated amylase and lipase which are now trending down.
Labs at [**Hospital1 **] showed ALT 5941, AST 4375, TBili 6.7, AP 304, lipase 1631, tylenol level 71.2, Na 128, K 3.7, Cl 93, HCO3 < 5, BUN 47, Cr 3.1 (prior normal in [**2197-1-29**]).
Feritin was 4905 thought to be in setting of her acute illness.
# Acute Pancreatitis:  Pt had a lipase of 3110 on admission to the SICU which trended down to 113 before we stopped checking.
# Hypertnatremia: Na maxed at 149, urine osms in 600s, so likely dehydrated while in the SICU.
WBC nadired at 1.8, Plt nadired at 71, and Hct nadired at 22.7 for which she received 1U of PRBC (Hct improved to 25.1).
She should have a repeat CBC as an outpatient.
After her INR normalized, her PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and decision was made to continue to hold warfarin until discussion with PCP in follow up.
# Transitional Issues -Pt to discuss further pain management plan with PCP [**Name10 (NameIs) 30412**] to discuss anticoagulation plan for prior DVT with PCP [**Name10 (NameIs) 30412**] should have repeat CBC the week after discharge to ensure marrow recovery -Pt to follow up with hepatologist Dr. [**Name (STitle) 23173**] on [**8-28**].
