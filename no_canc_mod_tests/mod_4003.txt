Her Hct was 32.3.
Vitals were noteworthy for a HR 67, BP 125/47.
The patient was seen in the ED by hepatology who recommended an EGD with possible intubation (given the patient's mental status).
During that time, she had an EGD which showed grade I varices.
Colonoscopy was limited due to poor prep, but no obvious sites of bleeding were noted.

Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to cooperate.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit where she was monitored with serial Hcts and vitals were checked for hemodynamic instability.
She was maintained on a PPI and Ciprofloxacin and once her blood pressure became stable, she was restarted on Nadolol.
She was discharged with instructions to follow up in [**Company 191**] for Hct monitoring and additional care.
Careful attention was paid to not only the blood pressure but the patient's heart rate while on these medications as she was noted to have asymptomatic bradycardia while sleeping.

While patient was admitted previously for ascites, there was no evidence of ascites on exam during this hospitalization.
