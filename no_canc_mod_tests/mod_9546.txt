The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure, was diuresed, creatinine increased from 2.1 to 2.6.
Echocardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis, 0.5 cm squared and an ejection fraction of 35%.
Patella reflexes equal bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  Hematocrit 37.8, creatinine 2.6, calcium 8.5, INR 1.8.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 70, left axis deviation down sloping ST depressions in 1 through AVL, V4 through V6 versus left ventricular strain.
Cardiac catheterization was also recommended.
The patient's kidney function was also assessed as acute on chronic renal failure, which at that time was attributed to prerenal failure.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization showed left main coronary artery with no significant obstructive disease, left anterior descending coronary artery with 60% stenosis in the mid portion, left circumflex 70% proximal, 90% stenosis at the obtuse marginal one, 90% distal obstruction and right coronary artery with small nondominant 70% mid vessel stenosis.
Aortic valve gradient was 15 mmHg.
The findings on duplex ultrasound were confirmed by MRA.
The patient's blood gases were normal at that time and on postoperative day number two the patient continue to resolve without neurological deficits.
The patient's creatinine continued to creep up to approximately 3.1.
