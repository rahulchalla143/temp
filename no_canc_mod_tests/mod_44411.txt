He was taken to CT scanner, where unfortunately he had one further event.
Unfortunately, the combination of propofol and dilantin dropped his blood pressures significantly but were fluid responsive.
Routine labs were drawn, and he was taken back to the CT scanner.
An MRI was always deferred given his known placement of pacemaker.
He had a functional examination with nonphysiologic visual loss and was discharged from the ED.
His exam was highly variable and split the midline to multiple modalities, and once again was disregarded from the ED.

CT PERFUSION STUDY: The cerebral blood volume, blood flow, and mean transit time maps appear unremarkable with no mismatch to suggest acute ischemia.
CTA HEAD AND NECK: Visualized aortic arch appears normal.
CXR [**2177-2-24**]: FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.
CXR [**2177-2-24**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing retrocardiac density, likely to be caused by atelectasis.
CT and CTA with perfusion study were normal.
Pt was rapidly extubated and post-extubation exam revealed significant right functional sensory-motor signs.
He was monitored on EEG LTM which was unremarkable with no epileptiform discharges for >36hrs.
These possible seizures may have been related to the patient tapering his alcohol use although given his long history of functional presentations and functional examination post extubation raises the possibility of non-epileptic events.
His weakness improved and he was discharged home on [**2177-2-26**] with home PT and neurology follow-up.
Intubated examination was non-focal.
Code stroke protocol CT was normal save some possible hyperemia in the L hemisphere on CTP which was latterly read as normal.
CTA revealed an aberrant right subclavian artery and was otherwise normal.
He had further workup with vit B12 227 and TSH 5.2.
HbA1c 5.4% and fasting lipid profile was normal with Chol 147 TGCs 60 HDL 66 LDL 69.
He was transiently hypotensive likely due to a combination of phenytoin load, lorazepam which along with propofol dropped his BP significantly to the low 80's.
Antibiotics were latterly stopped when it was possible to assess the patient, It was not possible to obtain an MRI due to the patient's pacemaker.
He was rapidly able to be extubated on [**2177-2-24**] and post-exubation examination revealed a functional right hemiparesis with right hemisensory disturbance and mental state examination as intact.
These possible seizures may have been related to the patient tapering his alcohol use although given a completely normal EEG LTM and functional examination raised the possibility of non-epileptic events.
Hemoglobin A1C and lipids were at goal and this was stopped.
# Pulmonary: CXR was stable, and pt did well from a respiratory standpoint once extubated.
WCC was stable and patient remained afebrile throughout.
# Hematology: Patient was noted to have a macrocytosis with MCV 100 which was likely related to alcohol abuse/B12/folate deficiency.
