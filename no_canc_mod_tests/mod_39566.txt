In the Emergency Department the initially vital signs were heart rate 170s, blood pressure 170/120 and temperature 97.8.
Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin were given empirically for systemic infection of possible oral source after his temperature spiked to 102.4.
Attempted Esmolol drip with good heart rate and blood pressure control with a bolus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 104.0.
Blood pressure 205/150, heart rate in the 130s.
LABORATORY:  Serum and urine tox screen was negative.
White blood cell count was 22.9 with 90% neutrophils, hematocrit 45, platelets 262.
CT of the head revealed a subtle hyperdensity and a few sulci, which could indicate blood or exudate, but otherwise was unremarkable.
An LP was attempted to obtain cerebral spinal fluid to rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as meningitis.
Since no cerebral spinal fluid could be obtained an MRI with gadolinium was performed to assess for possible meningeal enhancement and thus the suggestion of meningitis.
All cultures were negative and a chest x-ray was negative as well.
They recommended a CT scan of the neck to rule out a retropharyngeal abscess given the patient's recent dental work and this was negative.
He was imaged with an MRI of the L spine, which revealed evidence of an epidural and subdural hematoma.
It was felt that his blood was most likely due to the traumatic lumbar puncture attempts.
Neurosurgery was consulted to review the films and this was the conclusion that they came to and they recommended a repeat film in a few days to see if there was resolution.
A review of the MRI findings discussed in problem number one was felt to be blood as well and most likely tracking up from the lumbar spine blood.
A repeat MR of the L spine revealed basically no change.
An MRA of the brain was performed to rule out an aneursym as the possible cause for the subarachnoid blood.
The MRI revealed spasm of the basal artery, which was felt to be secondary to the subarachnoid hemorrhage, but no aneurysm.
A fluid restriction was put in place and the patient's sodium responded and was 132 at the time of discharge.
He will have a blood pressure check by VNA and will follow up with his outpatient doctor.
Hyperglycemia:  The patient was noted to have occasional random glucoses of greater then 200 and some glucosuria.
He did have a hemoglobin A1C, which was within normal limits.
