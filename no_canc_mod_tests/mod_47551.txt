CT Chest [**2101-2-7**]: Non-contrast study shows bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly and septal lines consistent with left ventricular heart failure.
ECHO [**2101-2-8**]  Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Her BP responded to the blood and however she continued to be tachycardic and hypoxic.
Her HR remained in the 120' and became hyponatremic so medicaine was consulted.
CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions.
The CT chest ended showing moderate sized bilateral pleural effusion and pulm edema.
The following LENI's were performed which showed no evidence of DVT.
ECHO was ordered and demonstrated severe biventricular dysfunction with EF of 20%.
The finding of newly diagnosed was concerning given the fact that the patient had a stress MIBI from [**6-1**] which showed EF of 67%.
We checked a TSH which was normal.
ECG during hospital showed no ST changes but there was noted poor R wave progession.
HEr lung exam improved and required less oxygen.
CPK was elevated after surgery but this was likely secondary to the surgery itself, no MB or troponin was done.
On transfer to medicine her enzymes were cycle with peak troponin to 0.03 due to CHF.
When she had become more stable she was switched back to her home regimen of metformin; metformin was held for 2 days prior to d/c in the setting of CT dye load, but should be restarted on [**2101-2-15**].
# Anemia-  On admission Hct was 30.9.
After the surgery Hct dropped to 26 and she was subsequently transfused two units.
Her Hct increased to 36.
Fe studies revealed anemia of chronic disease with low Fe and elevated ferritin.
You also need to arrange with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16362**] for ECHO and stress test.
