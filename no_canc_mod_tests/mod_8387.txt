Evaluation in the Emergency Room included activation of the trauma service.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation she was found to be quite hypothermic with a temperature of 95.0, heart rate was 82, her blood pressure was 91/60 with a respiratory rate of 16 and she was sating at 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat was noted for pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm.
A fast examination in the Emergency Room was negative.
A rectal exam was normal tone, guaiac negative.
Neurologically her exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY:  On presentation she had a white count of 6.3 with hematocrit of 38.5, platelet count 326.
PT/INR of 13.6 and 1.2 respectively with a PTT of 30.2.
Chemistry panel was significant for bicarbonate of 17, BUN and creatinine of 16 and 0.7.
Her serum and urine tox screens were negative.
She did have a Troponin that was found to be 35.6, a CK value of 235 and MB of 20 with an MB index of 8.5 suggesting a possible cardiac injury verses an acute coronary syndrome.
Her chest x-ray and pelvis film on presentation were negative.
She had a head CT and CT of the C-spine that were additionally negative.
She had a CT of the head with fine facial cuts that was additionally negative for any nasal or malar bone fracture.
Her abdominal and pelvic CT was normal.
Given this, this prompted the actual sending of the cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram which showed possible anterior cardiac injury by electrical signature.
A Cardiology consultation was obtained and an echo revealed anterior wall dysfunction with mild mitral regurgitation in the setting of having a Troponin of 35.
A Foley catheter was placed for urine output monitoring.
Additionally a subclavian catheter with Swann-Ganz hemodynamic monitoring device was placed showing that she had a Central venous pressure of 11 with a cardiac index of 3.2 in the setting of these previously mentioned cardiac findings and cardiac enzyme values.
She had excellent urine output, was given 60 mg of intravenous Lasix due to her depressed left ventricular function found to be approximately 40% by EF on her echocardiogram.
At that time the patient's assessment by their exam showed there is no signs of ruptured globe or retinal pathology.
Chest x-ray was done after PA line placement showed the line the be in appropriate position.
At this time she was on IMV and pressure support with a PEEP of 5 and an FIO2 of 40%  Arterial blood gases on this was 7.43 with a pCO2 of 39 and pO2 of 167, bicarbonate 27, base axis of 2.
She was still being supported with Levophed which is utilized for blood pressure monitoring after being given the 60 mg of Lasix which had quite a profound diuretic effect and in fact caused her to be somewhat hypotensive therefore, requiring some volume resuscitation.
Her central venous pressure on hospital day 2 in the Intensive Care Unit was 4 with a PA pressure of 26/15 with an index of 4 and output of 7.2.
Ultimately their recommendations were to have a follow-up echocardiogram in 2 to 3 days post injury to see if there is any recovery of Left ventricular function.
Optimization of her EF was still pending at the time of this dictation.
There was an echocardiogram that was obtained on [**2178-1-5**] as a follow-up per the Cardiology service.
