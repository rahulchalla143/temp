He took a nap, and when he woke up, his cousin checked his blood pressure and it was 60/40.
His VNA discovered that he had been givne the wrong medication (sounds like Losartan) instead of the Carafate.
His SBP was in the 60s, and he was started on empiric abx of Vanc/Zosyn, and Levophed.
A CXR at the OSH showed possible RLL consolidation.
During his ICU stay here, he was continued on broad spectrum abx though CXR here not particularly suggestive of pneumonia.
He had 2 paracenteses (1.5 L removed [**6-8**], and 1.25L removed [**6-9**]), neither showed evidence of SBP.
Prior to transfer to the floors, his vital signs are T 98 HR 66 BP 92/55 23 CVP 5 100% 2LNC I/0 - 605 for 24h.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-8-12**], there is now a very small pericardial effusion.
CXR [**2168-6-8**]: The known right aortic arch is redemonstrated.
There is some widening of the mediastinum on the right, which might be attributed to portable culture of the study as well as vascular engorgement.
PARA [**2168-6-9**]: IMPRESSION: Successful therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis yielding 1.25 L of clear yellow fluid.
MICRO: URINE CX [**2168-6-6**]: NO GROWTH.

His BP improved, and he was transferred to the medicine floors.
His creatinine remained stable.
His BP remained stable.
However, Cr downtrended, but remained stable at 1.7-1.9 for the last 3 days prior to discharge.
Pt will have repeat labs as an outpatient with results faxed to the liver transplant center.
His MELD was 28 on the day of discharge.
Normocytic anemia: Hct baseline ~ low 30s on last discharge.
Hct remained stable without any evidence of re-bleeding.
Chronic abdominal pain: Pt noted to have possible colopathy [**2-3**] cirrhosis vs. colitis on previous imaging.
OUTSTANDING TASKS: blood cultures from [**6-11**], [**6-12**] pending 6.
The kidney doctors saw [**Name5 (PTitle) **], and you were started on medication and albumin to help the kidney function, which slowly improved.
Once your blood pressure improved, you were cared for on the general medicine floors.
Your blood pressure remained stable.
The following medications were changed during this admission: - STOP Nadolol - STOP Lasix - STOP Spironolactone - STOP Gabapentin for now until we know where your renal function settles out - STOP Nitroglycerin tablets (this can cause low blood pressure) - STOP Sucralfate - STOP Clotrimazole troches (as you no longer need these)  - DECREASE the dose of Pantoprazole from 40mg by mouth twice daily to once daily (you have the prescription for twice daily, so just take it once daily for now)  - START Midrodrine 10mg by mouth three times daily - START Ondansetron 4mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed for nausea  Please continue the other medications you were taking prior to this admission.
You will need to have your labs checked on Monday, [**2168-6-20**], and have the results faxed to Dr.[**Name (NI) 948**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4400**].
