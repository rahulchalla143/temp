The patient was seen and evaluated in the Emergency Room at  [**Hospital3 **] and found to have a systolic blood pressure in the 200's with a CT scan showing a large right cerebellar infarct.
A magnetic resonance angiogram of the neck and brain was done which showed an acute right cerebellar infarct as well as 70-80 percent stenosis of both internal carotid arteries with severe atherosclerotic disease at the carotid bifurcations.
A TEE was done on [**8-24**] which showed a mobile atheroma in her ascending aorta as well as an EF of 58 percent.
In corroboration with the neurology service and the cardiology service, the decision was made to transfer the patient to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further evaluation for possible surgical treatment of this mobile atheroma.
Lung nodule with negative biopsy in [**2148**].
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.5, hematocrit 39.4 and platelet count 238.
PTT on admission was 74.3.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with heart rate in the 70's and blood pressure of 239/65 on admission, she is saturating 95 percent on room air.
Her DP and PT were dopplerable on the right.
They agreed with heparinization and requested a repeat magnetic resonance imaging which was done.
Her blood pressure was controlled with Nipride drip and an A line was placed.
The echocardiogram was reviewed and it did show a 6 to 7 mm mobile atheroma in the ascending aorta.
A multi- disciplinarian review of the findings was done.
It was therefore decided to medically manage the patient with heparinization as well as Coumadin and blood pressure control with systolic in the 140 to 160 range.
A stat head CT without contrast was obtained and the patient did not have any new bleed.
She was seen by neurology who felt that she should have a metabolic work up for the source of her somnolence and blood cultures were sent as well as a repeat urinalysis.
Also of note the patient did have a bout of tachycardia with a heart rate in the low 100's.
An EKG done at that time showed some deepening of her ST depression laterally.
Her heart rate was controlled with intravenous Lopressor.
On repeat EKG she did have still have some deepening of ST in the lateral leads as well as flipped T waves in V2 and V3.
It was therefore decided to send cardiac enzymes to rule the patient out.
As part of an infectious workup for mental status changes a chest x-ray was done on the morning of [**8-26**].
The first set of cardiac enzymes did come back negative.
Nitroprusside drip titrated to keep the systolics in 140    to 160.
