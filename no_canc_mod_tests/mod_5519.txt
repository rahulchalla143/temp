He was diuresed at that time and an echocardiogram done during that admission showed dilated left ventricle, LA, and RA with aortic and mitral sclerosis with mild AS, trace aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization done on [**2103-7-18**] showed a normal left main, left anterior descending coronary artery with no disease, circumflex with total obstruction at the distal take of the posterior descending coronary artery.
Severe mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension, an ejection fraction of 47 percent.
LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission, white count 6, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 162.
PT 17.2, PTT 38, INR 2.0.

ALT 9, AST 24, alkaline phosphatase 90, direct bilirubin 1, total protein 6.9.
Urinalysis  was negative.
Chest x-ray showed mild ventricular failure, moderate cardiomegaly with a right effusion.
Electrocardiogram was atrial fibrillation with a rate of 73, right bundle branch block, nonspecific ST changes.
Blood pressure 100/70.
Respiratory rate 22.
Pulses - radial 2+ bilaterally, carotid 2+ bilaterally without a bruit, femoral 2+ bilaterally, and dorsalis pedis 1+ bilaterally.
HEENT - pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
CT showed an enlarged nodule liver suspicious for cirrhosis.
His cross clamp time was 118 minutes with a bypass time of 150 minutes.
He was atrial fibrillation at 74 beats per minute with a CVP of 25 and PAD of 33.
He had no further bleeding from his chest tubes.
On postoperative day #1, the patient continued to be hemodynamically stable with no further drainage from his chest tubes.
However, he remained in the intensive care unit for close hemodynamic monitoring as well as pulmonary support given his persistent oxygen requirement.
A chest x-ray done showed a moderate size right sided pleural effusion and a thoracentesis done that at the bedside drained 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid following which the patient's oxygen requirement was improved.
At the time of this dictation the patient's physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs - temperature 98.0, heart rate 72 and atrial fibrillation, blood pressure 103/62, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 99 percent on three liters.

Respiratory - clear to auscultation on the left with diminished breath sounds on the right one third of the way up.
