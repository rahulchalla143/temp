She underwent a CABG x 3 with LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the RCA, and SVG to the OM and a mitral valve replacemnet with a 25mm C-E porcine valve.
Total cardio-puolmonary bypass time was 150 minutes and her total cross-clamp time was 118 minutes.
She was transferred to the CSRU A-paced at a rate of 88 with a MAP of 70 and a CVP of 13.
Her hemodynamics were labile in her postoperative course requiring continuous pacing (for a couple [**Last Name (un) 32460**] only) and IV drip medications including nitroglycerine, neosynephrine, nipride, and levophed to keep systolic blood pressure stable.
Her underlying rhythm was a SR with first degree AV-block.
Her heart rhythm continued as a first degree block with multiple bursts of atrial fibrillation continuing until post-operative day 12 -- these bursts were rate controlled with IV lopressor.
CXR at this time showed a right lower lobe opacity.
White blood cell count was elevated with a max of 29.3 on [**10-22**].
Sputum culture from [**10-23**] grew sensitive Staph aureus.
A workup of the possible sources of infection was undertaken with final diagnosis being probable aspiration pneumonia with possible early C. diff infection.
White blood cell count on [**10-26**] was 12.7 and trending downwards.
Her initial head CT was negative for any acute infarct and reason for confusion was thought to be sedative medications.
