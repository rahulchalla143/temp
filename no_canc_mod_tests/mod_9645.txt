Upon admission to [**Location (un) **] his vital signs were temperature 97, heart rate 58, respiratory rate 16.
He was alert and oriented times three and his physical exam was unremarkable other than the gangrene.
LABORATORY DATA:  Initial labs were white blood cell count of 16.7 with 94% neutrophils, hematocrit 33.3, platelet count 240,000, sodium 136, potassium 4.1, chloride 103, CO2 21, BUN 63, creatinine 1.8, glucose 237 with anion gap equal to 12, albumin .7, normal LFTs, CK of 153, CK MB 5.7.
Urinalysis was positive for nitrites with 11-20 white blood cells, 0-2 red blood cells and many bacteria with tract protein.
Initial chest x-ray showed left lower lobe pneumonia.
The final read of the chest x-ray showed chronic changes.
However, blood cultures 4/4 bottles grew out MRSA.
Repeat blood cultures from [**7-4**] and [**7-6**] have been negative to date.
On [**2146-3-4**] the patient was found to become increasingly lethargic and bradycardic to a heart rate of 37.
His left wrist was noted to be inflamed and his BUN and creatinine increased to 85 and 3.6 respectively.
His left wrist was tapped and grew gram positive cocci consistent with MRSA septic arthritis.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained for evaluation endocarditis and was notable for a large left ventricular thrombus, a decreased EF equal to 15-20% with globally decreased systolic function, moderate pulmonary hypertension, thickening of aortic valve, trace mitral, aortic, and tricuspid insufficiency.
His renal function continued to deteriorate with a FENa less than 1, consistent with a prerenal azotemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Outpatient medications: Lipitor 20 mg [**Hospital1 **], Allopurinol 100 mg q d, NPH 22 units q a.m., 16 units q h.s., Humalog 2 units q a.m., 8 units at dinner, Nitro patch 0.4 mg from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Nitro 0.4 mg sublingual prn, Celexa 40 mg q d, Flomax 0.4 mg q d, q h.s., Coumadin 2.5 mg q d, Colace 100 mg q d, Tylenol prn, Milk of Magnesia prn.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the MICU, the patient's admission labs at [**Hospital1 69**] were as follows: White blood count was 22.4 with 96% neutrophils, hematocrit 33, platelet count 353,000, sodium 125, potassium 4, chloride 92, CO2 17, BUN 109, creatinine 4.4, glucose 93, calcium 6.9, magnesium 3.2, phosphorus 7.5, albumin 2.8, ALT 35, AST 47, LDH 291, alkaline phosphatase 117, total bilirubin 5.2, triglycerides 87, Vancomycin level 13.5, lipase 85, troponin 1.9.
CK 252.
Plastics and hand surgery were consulted on [**2146-7-8**] suggesting an MRI of the left hand and wrist when the patient was stable and to keep the wrist elevated at all times.
Wrist films on [**2146-7-8**] showed no evidence of osteomyelitis, however, were positive for osteopenia.
Urine cultures were positive for greater than 100,000 yeast.
Blood cultures have been negative to date.
Vascular:  Vascular was consulted on [**2146-7-8**] and their recommendation was that the patient requires a right above the knee amputation since transmetatarsal amputation would not control the infection adequately.
Initial values were CVP 15, wedge 14, cardiac output was 3.4, later improved to 4.0, cardiac index 1.8, later improved to 2.1 and SVF was normal.
Furthermore, Dopamine drip was attempted to increase cardiac output and chronotropia, however, this caused his cardiac output to drop and SVR to increase and therefore was discontinued.
The PA catheter was pulled on [**2146-7-10**] and his blood pressure has since improved.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2146-7-8**] showed a right and left atrium mildly dilated, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular function is seriously depressed with a large left ventricular thrombus, severe global RV wall hypokinesis, tract AR, physiologic MR, 1+ TR, mild pulmonary hypertension, no echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
GI:  The patient had a KUB on [**2146-7-8**] which showed colonic ileus.
KUB on [**2146-7-12**] showed resolving dilated bowel loops.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**2146-7-9**] showed sludge in the gallbladder, however, no pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall thickening or evidence of biliary obstruction.
Urine was sent for urine sodium and creatinine and urine culture showing a prerenal picture.
Heme:  The patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells on [**2146-7-8**] with good response of hematocrit from 28.2 to 35.1.
His iron level is 57, TIBC is decreased at 146, TRF is decreased at 112, ferritin is 356, consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  Ectopy is decreased with increasing the potassium during the dialysis.
His RPR was non reactive, his Vitamin B12 was greater than [**2143**], his Folate was greater than 20 and his TSH was still pending in the MICU.
Labs on [**2146-7-12**] when the patient was transferred to the medicine floor, white blood cells 21.3, hematocrit 33.2, platelet count 138,000, PT 15, PTT 67.8, INR 1.6, sodium 135, potassium 4.1, chloride 100, CO2 24, BUN 35, creatinine 2.1 and glucose 138, calcium 7.5, magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 3.2, total bilirubin 13.7.
Physical exam on admission to the medicine floor: Vital signs were 97.4, blood pressure 112/74, heart rate 67, respiratory rate 15.
Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally from anterior, however, bibasilar rales.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was continued on Vancomycin, being dosed according to trough levels less than 15.
Vancomycin levels were checked q day to determine dosing.
The patient is currently awaiting MRI for further evaluation of his septic left wrist.
The patient's right upper extremity was found to be cool on [**2146-7-14**] and right upper extremity ultrasound was performed which ruled out an upper extremity DVT.
This is somewhat improved when the patient's potassium and magnesium are above 4 and 2 respectively.
The patient is still medically too unstable to undergo pacemaker at this time, however, when his infection clears and after surgery is complete, EP studies will be done and the patient will require pacemaker.
It is not thought at this time that the thrombus is infected due to the fact that blood cultures obtained here at [**Hospital1 346**] all have been negative to date.
On the evening of [**2146-7-13**] the patient was believed to have had high blood pressure in the right arm ranging from the 200-300/dopplerable to blood pressures of 110-120/dopplerable in the left arm.
Patient underwent CT with and without contrast of the chest with pretreatment of Mucomyst and which showed no evidence of aortic dissection due to the absence of an intimal flap in the face of fluid density surrounding the anterior mediastinum adjacent to the ascending aorta.
Chest x-ray at the time showed no enlargement of mediastinum and a left basilar opacity.
When the patient was monitored that day in hemodialysis with a Dinamap machine there were no problems getting his blood pressures and they ranged in the 100's to one teens over 50's to 60's.
The patient has been continually monitored with the Dinamap machine on the floor with no further issues with high blood pressure.
An abdominal ultrasound obtained on [**2146-7-14**] for evaluation of the biliary and urinary systems showed no signs of biliary or urinary obstruction and was positive only for gallbladder sludge.
This study was obtained due to the patient's continued high creatinine as well as the patient's continued hyperbilirubinemia.
His hematocrit was stable subsequent to his transfusions in the MICU until [**2146-7-15**] when his hematocrit dropped to 28.7 and after surgery the patient's hematocrit was 27.8, therefore he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells with good response to hematocrit of 30.3.
The patient's PT, PTT and INR were monitored throughout his stay.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  When the patient was transferred out from the MICU, he was on tube feeds running at 35 cc per hour.
Calorie counts will be performed and need for tube feeding in the future via NG tube will be assessed.
