She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a left heart catheterization and PCA.
The patient was sent to the CCU on an IV nitroglycerin drip for blood pressure control still with intermittent chest pain and nausea.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of 95.4, pulse 66, blood pressure 101/61, respiratory rate 17, 02 saturation 99% on 5 liters per nasal cannula.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
INITIAL LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 7.8, hematocrit 35, 82% neutrophils, 3% lymphocytes, platelets 197,000.
Sodium 125, potassium 3.3, chloride 96, bicarbonate 23, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, glucose 163.
PT 12.9, PTT 40, INR 1.2, CK 45.
Calcium 8.3, magnesium 1.6, phosphorus 2.8.
The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minute, normal axis, intraventricular contractions present, 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in II, III, and aVF, downsloping ST depressions, and T wave inversions in I, aVL, and V2.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  PUMP:  The patient had cardiac enzymes cycled which revealed an elevated CK and troponin leak, peak CK was 867 consistent with an evolving inferior MI secondary to RCA occlusion.
The patient had an echocardiogram to evaluate for left ventricular function.
This echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 45-55%, mild global left ventricular hypokinesis, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion.
ALT and AST were within normal limits.
The patient's blood pressure was actually kept below 140 throughout the hospital course and, in fact, was generally around 100 systolic.
She was ready for discharge after PT evaluation said that she had no acute needs and needed regular cardiac rehab.
Will follow-up with cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4783**] on [**2180-11-29**] and to arrange for cardiac rehabilitation services through his office.
