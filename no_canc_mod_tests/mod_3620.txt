CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2145-8-31**] 11:12 PM There is mild cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion but no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2145-8-31**] 10:10 PM No acute process.
CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS LUNG BASES:  Mild-to-moderate nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions are new with bibasilar atelectasis.
CT ABDOMEN: Liver steatosis is diffuse and the liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesion.
Left kidney cyst measuring 11 mm was already assessed by son[**Name (NI) **].
[**2145-9-4**] POST-PICC PLACEMENT CHEST X-RAY FINDINGS:  This film is taken with improved technique.
[**2145-9-1**] TRANSTHORACIC ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-7-30**], aortic stenosis has progressed.
Brief Hospital Course: 84F with no known coronary disease but a history of DM/ HTN/ HL, diastolic heart failure and known mod AS, mild AI and breast CA who p/w fall at home earlier on the morning of [**8-31**], on the floor for 8 hours, developed rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, found to have group B strep bacteremia of unknown source.
# FEVER, SEPSIS, BACTEREMIA:  On morning of admission, pt developed fever of 102.9, hypotension with SBP into the 70s, despite IVF hydration, tachycardia.
- Blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci in pairs & chains, speciated to group B strep (pansensitive).
- CT abdomen and pelvis - no evidence of infection - RUE US, no evidence of DVT to explain swelling--most likely from lymphedema from breast cancer s/p excisions and radiation treatment - Urosepsis also a possibility, as GBS 10,000-100,000 organisms/mL did grow out of urine.
- ID consulted - Started on empiric vanc & ceftriaxone pending culture data, gave fluid bolus, then transferred to the MICU for further workup and management of sepsis.
- Blood cultures x2 were positive for gram posiive cocci in pairs & chains, final speciation of Group B strep - Urine cultures grew pansensitive Proteus mirabilis >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML and GBS 10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML - Antibiotics narrowed to ceftriaxone alone on [**2145-9-3**] - TTE shows severe aortic stenosis, high risk of endocarditis in setting of GBS bacteremia, so we opted not to do TEE.
# RHABDOMYOLYSIS - likely secondary to prolonged immobilization, On UA 1 RBC and Moderate blood, CK > 20x upper limit.
On admission, Cr was 1.6, which was near baseline (1.3-1.8).
Troponin bump most likely [**1-21**] to infection, severe AS, LVH.
ECG was unconcerning.
- Cardiac echo showed LVEF 55% and severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2) with moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP 43mmHg) - CK significantly elevated & initially trended up 4062->5032, MB stable 21->22, troponin 0.2->0.45, all of which resolved with control of her infection and volume resuscitation  # AS w/ diastolic CHF: h/o CHF with preserved systolic function (LVEF > 55%), severe AS, mild AR.
c/o dyspnea but appears euvolemic, lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
- Monitored resp status closely given IVF hydration for rhabdomyolysis as above, pt appeared clinically euvolemic and was satting well on RA, but CXR showed worsening fluid status, so diuresed with 20mg IV lasix ONCE then transitioned back to home lasix.
Will need evaluation for AVR after infection resolved.
Likely etiology:  congestive hepatopathy, fatty liver (as evidenced by CT scan) - Trend weekly as outpatient per OPAT - Consider hepatitis panel as outpatient for r/o.
