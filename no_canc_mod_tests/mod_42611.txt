History of Present Illness: The patient is a 43 year-old female transferred from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital c infarct to spleen secondary to thrombus in descending aorta diagnosed by CT scan.
A CT scan was performed in the workup and she was transferred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further evaluation.
No cyanosis, cords, or edema  Pertinent Results: ON ADMISSION: [**2117-6-4**] 05:00PM BLOOD WBC-17.0* RBC-5.12 Hgb-10.4* Hct-32.3* MCV-63* MCH-20.2* MCHC-32.1 RDW-17.3* Plt Ct-487* [**2117-6-4**] 05:00PM BLOOD PT-13.4* PTT-24.8 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2117-6-4**] 05:00PM BLOOD Glucose-90 UreaN-8 Creat-1.0 Na-139 K-3.5 Cl-106 HCO3-24 AnGap-13 [**2117-6-4**] 05:00PM BLOOD Calcium-9.5 Phos-1.7* Mg-2.4 .

RADIOLOGY  Final Report CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2117-6-4**] 3:08 PM CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS Reason: please evaluate from chin to mid thigh / include neck, arch Contrast: [**Hospital 13288**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 43 year old woman with thrombus in Aorta REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please evaluate from chin to mid thigh / include neck, arch vessels to external iliacs CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging was obtained through the chest without IV contrast.
Then after the bolus intravenous administration of 130 cc of nonionic contrast, imaging was obtained through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
The pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney are unremarkable.
At the upper pole of the right kidney, there is a 2.3 cm low- density lesion with a suggestion of enhancing septations within it, further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The uterus is enlarged and the uterine contour is lobulated with multiple enhancing lesions consistent with uterine fibroids.
The celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are widely patent.
2.3 cm low-density lesion within the right kidney, which does not appear as a simple cyst, correlation with MRI is recommended 7.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2117-6-4**] 2:43 PM CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Reason: DESCENDING THORACIC AORTA THROMBUS [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 43 year old womanneeds possible endovascular surgery REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: pre-op HISTORY: Possible endovascular surgery, pre-op evaluation for AAA repair.
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH FINDINGS The lungs are clear.
Resting heart rate: 82 bpm Resting blood pressure: 110/80 Exercise Duration: 7 min Peak heart rate: 133 bpm Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained: 75 % Peak blood pressure: 156/74 Symptoms during exercise: none Reason exercise terminated: fatigue ECG findings: 0.5 mm ST segment depression in V4-6 at peak exercise, which progressed to biphasic T waves in early recovery and returned to baseline by minute 10 of recovery METHOD: Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi.
Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
Gated images were not performed secondary to technical difficulties caused by the patient's irregular heart rate.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette demonstrates no short interval change with moderate layering pleural effusions, bilaterally, as well as retrocardiac opacity.
IMPRESSION: 1)New moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions 2)Retrocardiac opacity likely reperesents atelectasis but in the appropriate clinical setting could represent airspace consolidation.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2117-6-10**] 4:08 PM CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Reason: s/p ct d/c [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 43 year old woman s/p Endarterectomy of Desc.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: s/p ct d/c EXAMINATION: AP chest.
Single AP view of the chest was obtained [**2117-6-10**] at 16:00 hours and is compared with the prior day's radiograph.
Of concern on the current examination is a patchy opacity developing in the right mid lung field, likely in the anterior portion of the right upper lobe which may be secondary to aspiration/pneumonia.
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation after endartectomy of descending thoracic and abdominal aorta.
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2117-6-10**].
She underwent pre-operative workup and underwent a left thoracotomy on [**2117-6-8**] with the following: (1) Thoracic and abdominal aortic atherectomy using right heart bypass (2) Epiaortic duplex scan (3) Left femoral artery reconstruction (4) Endarterectomy of thoracic and abdominal aorta (5) Epiaortic duplex and (6) Repair of left femoral vessels.
You will need a MRI to evaluate the 2.3 cm low-density lesion within the right kidney on your CT scan.
You will also need a thyroid ultrasound to evaluate your heterogeneous thyroid seen on CT scan.
You will also need to have him adjust your blood pressure medications.
