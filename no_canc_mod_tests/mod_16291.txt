Differential considerations include subacute subarachnoid hemorrhage or focal meningitis.
Consultation with interventional neuroradiology/neurosurgery, for further evaluation if necessary, by conventional angiogram can be considered, after performing a non-contrast CT head study, to document the presence of hemorrhage.
Evaluation for cortical veins is limited on the present study.
Correlation with clinical neurological examination and LP can also be considered given the imaging findings above.

Conventional Angiogram on [**9-16**]: (prelim impression by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Mild beading of multiple distal vessels in the right MCA territory.
On arrival, the patient's exam was notable for hypertension.
CT brain was suggestive of a small right frontal, parietal, temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
LP  was consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage ([**Numeric Identifier **] RBCs in Tube 4).
She underwent conventional angiogram which did not show an aneurysm or AVM.
