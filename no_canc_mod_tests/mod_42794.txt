The morning of admission the patient was noted to be acutely "cyanotic", "diaphoretic" with increased heart rate to the 130s, increased respiratory rate to the 40s, blood pressure 126/76, oxygen saturation of 81% on three liters, improved to 95% on nonrebreather.
Chest x-ray in the Emergency Department was negative for acute infiltrate.
CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolus.
Her oxygen saturation was excellent on AC vent settings of 450 by 14, PEEP of 5, 50% FIO2.
Blood pressure was 90s to 110s over 50 to 80, heart rate 90s to 110s.
She was also transiently bradycardic to the 30s in the Emergency Department with drop in blood pressure and this occurred while bucking the vent, was attributed to a vasovagal episode.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 97.7, blood pressure 96/52 with a MAP of 67, heart rate 92, range 90s to 110s.
Vent settings were 450 by 14, PEEP of 5, 50% FIO2, respiratory rate 14 to 17 with a PIP of 24 and a plateau of 16.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, 3.0 millimeters to 2.0 millimeters, anicteric.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's admission data was significant for white blood cell count of 11.9 which was decreased from her previous discharge when it was 15.9.
Hematocrit was 32.0, platelet count 496,000.
Differential on her white blood cell count was 88% neutrophils, 2% bands, 2% lymphocytes, and 8% monocytes.
Her chemistries were significant for potassium of 3.2 and a glucose of 245.
Urinalysis was significant for a specific gravity of 1.013, protein 30, occasional bacteria, [**3-12**] white blood cells.
Chest x-ray showed a left sided effusion, left lower lobe atelectasis, and endotracheal tube in place.
CTA showed no pulmonary embolus, left effusion with left lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis, multiple nodular opacities of the periphery with a tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance consistent with aspiration pneumonia or other infectious etiology.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 150, left axis deviation, poor R wave progression, T wave inversions in I and V1, J point elevation in V2 to V4.
The day following the tracheostomy placement while the patient was being turned, she desaturated and some blood clots were suctioned out of the tracheostomy.
An urgent bronchoscopy was done and several old clots were pulled out the bronchi resulting in improved saturation.
The patient remained on 50% face mask with 99 to 100% saturation during the rest of her hospitalization.
Cardiac - After the patient was admitted, a CK and troponin was sent secondary to her sinus tachycardia.
Her troponin was elevated at 1.01.
Her CKs were not elevated.
Over the rest of her hospital stay, troponin levels were checked and all these trended down.
However, the troponin leak was thought to be secondary to demand ischemia.
The patient should have an echocardiogram to follow-up as there is no history of cardiac disease for any new wall motion abnormality.
The patient never had a high fever and her white blood cell count never rose.
A random cortisol was checked and it was normal.
However, the patient was asymptomatic with this and her urine output remained steady and greater than 30cc/hour at all times.
In discussion with the patient's husband, the patient had never had a magnetic resonance scan in the past to diagnose her, lumbar puncture, and had had very little treatment or workup for her disease.
In addition, the patient's daughter had been recently diagnosed with magnetic resonance scan and it was thought that this patient's disease was not multiple sclerosis given it was atypical.
Thus, a magnetic resonance scan of the head and spine were obtained.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**], to set up neurological follow-up.
The magnetic resonance scan results should also be followed up on as they were not completed at the time of discharge.
Infectious disease - The patient had blood cultures initially on admission on [**2128-2-24**].
Her sputum culture grew oropharyngeal flora, gram positive rods and gram positive cocci.
The patient was not treated for this as her urinalysis did not have evidence of infection and her white blood cell count was not elevated and she was afebrile.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: 1.
The patient should also be considered for a future echocardiogram to evaluate for any abnormality given recent troponin leak attributed during this admission to demand ischemia.
