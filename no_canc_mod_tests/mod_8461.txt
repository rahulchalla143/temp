Admission Date:  [**2182-10-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-10-31**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: Hemotysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy, [**10-7**] IR embolization, [**10-8**] LLL biopsy, [**10-14**] R thoracentesis, [**10-18**] bilateral thoracenteses, [**10-25**]   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 23976**] is an 87 year-old Jamaican male with history of mucinous breast cancer (s/p MRM in [**2172**] and tamoxifen therapy), hypertension, CHF and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from an OSH for further evaluation of hemoptysis.
The patient had a recent admission to the same OSH from [**Date range (1) 23977**] for increasing dyspnea and was treated for a CHF and COPD exacerbation, as well as a RLL PNA.
Admission imaging showed a CXR with a dense infiltrate in the LLL.
CT scan reported bilateral patchy infiltrates with small bilateral blebs.
The patient subsequently had a bronchoscopy to identify a source of bleeding.
Bronchoscopy showed a small amout of blood diffusely but no clear sourc of bleedinge.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hemoptysis and for possible invasive endoscopic therapy.

Imaging: [**10-6**] CT chest w/ contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[**10-11**] CT chest w/ contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2182-10-24**] CT chest w/ contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-10-7**], pleural effusion has redeveloped.
[**10-31**] CXR (AP port): (preliminary read) UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  The patient is status post removal of the right pleural drain and a right PICC.

Admission CT scan showed emphysema with large bullae, small subsegmental PE in LLL, two lesions in LLL suspicious for malignancy, and bibasilar honeycombing (?UIP).
Admission sputum cultures were negative (OP flora), but the patient was continued on vancomycin and zosyn, as above.
On [**10-11**] a repeat CT scan was performed to assess for efficacy of antibiotics.
CT showed improvement in LLL cyst with AF level; however interval development of RLL cystic structure with AF level.
Septic emboli was felt to be an unlikely etiology, as [**10-6**] Echo was negative for valvular vegitations.
On [**10-12**] BAL cultures returned as positive for aspergillus fumigatus (sparse growth) HSV-1 (by fluorescent antibody testing) and the patient was started on voriconazole and acyclovir.
Galactomannan, B-glucan, and histoplasma Ag were sent and returned negative.
Fungal sputum cultures were also sent, which returned positive for aspergillus fumigatus in [**12-18**] samples.
HIV Ab testing was also performed, which was negative.
On [**10-14**] a biopsy of the LLL mass was performed by IR in order to further evaluate etiology of symptoms and progression on imaging.
On [**10-25**] bilateral thoracenteses were performed to alleviate dyspnea, also with negative culture results at time of discharge.
Lung exam showed minimal improvement on antimicrobial therapy, with significantly decreased breath sounds at lung bases bilaterally.
Oxygen saturations have always been good, ranging 95-100% on 2L NC, weaned to room air after thoracenteses were performed.
# Lung masses: The patient was found to have bilateral lung masses on admission CT concerning for malignancy given patient's previous history of breast cancer and significant smoking history.
Bronchial brushings from [**10-7**] BAL were negative for malignant cells.
hcG and AFP were negative with elevated LD, which were interpreted as negative for embryonic tumor.
Pathology from CT-guided LLL mass biopsy on [**10-14**] was negative for malignancy.
CA 27.29 levels were sent to evaluate for possible breast cancer.
[**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA levels were sent given concern for hemoptysis and findings of bronchial inflammation on admission CT; results were negative, making vasculitis unlikely.
The Hematology/Oncology service was consulted, and they suggested CT abd/ pelvis in future for further assessment of possible metastases.
Creatinine upon discharge was stable at 1.4. .
Serial EKGs were performed and showed lower voltage than on admission.
On [**10-31**] a TTE showed large pleural effusions and trivial pericardial effusion.
Hct upon discharge was stable at 25; however, this had been slowly declining throughout his hospitalization most likely secondary to slow ooze of blood.
TTE was performed, which showed no intracardiac clot.
There was no pulmonary thrombus present on repeat imaging on [**10-11**].
A RUE US was performed and showed evidence of a non-occlusive thrombus in the right subclavian and axillary veins.
The patient's family refused any further diagnostic testing at this time, including aspiration of cyst fluid, and opted for discharge with Infectious Disease and Pulmonology follow-up.
