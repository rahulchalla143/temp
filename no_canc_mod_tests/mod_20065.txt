[**4-12**] MRI (post angio #1) 1.
MRI of the brain, demonstrating new area of slow diffusion within the right temporal-occipital lobe region, consistent with infarction.
[**4-14**] CTA chest (PE protocol) No evidence of acute pulmonary embolus.
Exam fluctuated over next hour.
Was taken for emergent MR which showed a left M2 occlusion.
Had a repeat CT which was negative for bleed, and taken back for repeat angiogram which showed right PCA (P2) occlusion!
NEURO: His exam was notable only for a dense left field cut.
A Repeat MRI/MRA was performed on [**4-12**] that showed no L MCA stroke and patent MCA, with R PCA infarct (medial occip lobe, sparing pole).
Stroke workup included TEE that showed no ASD, no thrombus, but large complex atheroma in aorta (descending, ascending, arch).
Upon discharge he was on day 3 of coumadin 5 mg, INR 1.1.
Pulm He was stable until [**4-14**] when he developed a new O2 requirement and some tachypnea, chest CTA showed no evidence of PE and he was quickly weaned off of O2.
CXR follow up showed no evidence of pneumonia.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled x3 again and they were negative, EKG's unchanged.
ID: On [**4-14**] overnight he spiked a fever and workup was initiated that showed normal CXR and U/A and urine culture and blood culture were sent that are pending.
He also underwent PE workup that was negative.
His INR will need every other day checks until therapeutic at 2-3.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your PCP and arrange to have your INR drawn on Sunday.
