Chest x-ray there demonstrated large left and small right effusion.
Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital6 3426**], where she was intubated for respiratory distress, and noted to have a heart rate in the 120s, rhythm atrial fibrillation.
At [**Hospital3 **], the patient received digoxin for rate control, noted to have a temperature of 106 with blood cultures drawn.
Had a limited echocardiogram which demonstrated preserved LV/RV function without effusion from which time per patient's family request, the patient was transferred.
Coronary artery disease, 50% mid right coronary artery, 100% mid left anterior descending artery, 90% D1, 80% distal circ.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 101.6, blood pressure 77-85/40-58, heart rate 86-91, respirations 20, and 100%.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 12.7.
Differential: 86 neutrophils, 7 lymphocytes, 5 monocytes, 1 eosinophil.
Hematocrit 30.5, platelets 508.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 99, bicarb 26, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, glucose 74, calcium 7.3, magnesium 1.4, phosphorus 3.2.
Mrs [**Known lastname 35080**] was monitored in the admission evening in the Coronary Care Unit and underwent evaluation of her congestive heart failure and mitral stenosis.
Her mitral stenosis was evaluated by emergency echo was found to be severe, despite prior effort at percutaneous valvuloplasty at [**Hospital1 2025**].
She underwent evaluation for any other improvement in cardiac hemodynamics including cardiac catheterization with shuntogram which demonstrated trivial left to right shunting from a perforated atrial septum.
Eventually, her Levophed was gently weaned off with stable blood pressures by [**2182-4-25**].
She underwent tap of bilateral pleural effusions which demonstrated transudative fluid only.
Liver function tests remained stable with modest elevations in her total bilirubin which were self limited.
The patient declined further evaluation with head CT scan and neurologic examination given overall poor prognosis.
