Increased IVC diameter (>2.1cm) with <35% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (10-20mmHg).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
CT head [**2137-4-29**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CTA Chest [**2137-5-1**]  IMPRESSION: 1.
Interval increase in hemoperitoneum, centered in the right paracolic gutter, without evidence of active extravasation at the time of the CT scan.
Noncalcified pulmonary nodules, followup chest CT to document resolution or stability remains recommended in [**7-19**] months as suggested before.
Chest PA/lat 3/ IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-30**] through 28:  Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left, stable since [**5-3**].
She was noted with dropping hematocrits and required several PRBC transfusions; the initial concern was that there may be a retroperitoneal bleed given right adrenal gland hematoma with small amount of retroperitoneal hemorrhage noted on CT imaging.
Her hematocrit during the remainder of her hopsital course have ranged between 29-32 with 32 most recent on [**2137-5-6**].
Orthopedics was consulted for her multiple orthopedic injuries; these were managed non operatively.
She was made non weight bearing for her right clavicle fracture and weight bearing as tolerated for her pelvic fractures.
She also had an Echocardiogram performed which showed a normal EF.

Followup Instructions: **Follow up with your primary care doctor for pulmonary nodules seen on CT imaging.
It is being recommended that a repeat chest CT be done within the next 3-6 months.
