On [**2199-6-30**], his weight is 3155 grams.
Vital signs and clinical course were within normal limits in the newborn nursery.
Specifically the pulse range 120s to 130s, respiratory rate 40s to 50s.
Upper extremity pulses were wnl.
Apgars 7 and 9.
Temperature 98.2, pulse in the low 100s - 102 to 110.
Pulse increases to 120s+.
Pulse oxymetry readings are 96-100% in the lower extremities.
The four extremity blood pressures are as follows: Right arm: 82/56, mean 66.
The infant's hyperoxia test revealed Left radial arterial blood gas of pH of 7.44, PO2 408, PCO2 of 33.
Peripheral pulses in the upper extremity normal, lower extremity pulses are very difficult to palpate in the inguinal, popliteal, dorsalis pedal area.
Abdominal examination was normal.
Examination of the back appears normal.
EKG appears within normal limits in rhythm as well as QRS axis of about 130.
Left radial artery gas: As noted above, pH 7.44, PCO2 33, PO2 408 on 100% oxygen.
Due to the increased gradient of the diastolic blood pressure of upper extremities compared to the lower extremities and the physical examination corroborating difficulty in palpating lower extremity pulses, the infant is being transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] for continued cardiovascular evaluation and management.
