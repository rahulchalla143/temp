At the outside hospital, an abdominal ultrasound was performed which revealed aortic dissection.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
Blood pressure upon arrival to the Emergency Department was 190/79.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature of 96.0 F.; blood pressure of 146/50 while on Nipride and Esmolol drip.
Heart rate of 61.
Physical examination is notable for regular rate and rhythm, with no evidence of aortic insufficiency murmur.
Abdominal examination is benign.
Neurological examination obtained in the Emergency Department shows cranial nerves II through XII to be intact.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses are present bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61.
Labs are remarkable for an elevated white blood cell count of 17.1 but the remainder of her labs are unremarkable.
CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed an aortic dissection extending from the level of the pulmonary vein beyond the left subclavian and into the celiac artery but not including the celiac artery.
She was initially placed on a Nipride and Esmolol drip to maintain her systolic blood pressures between 100 and 120.
She was noted to become easily agitated which would cause her blood pressures to rise up to the 160s.
q. day, to maintain her systolic blood pressure in the one-teens to 120 range.
A repeat chest, abdomen and pelvic CT angiogram was performed.
CT angiogram on admission showed no involvement of the aortic arch to suspect extension of the dissection up into the carotids.
Her blood pressure was being tightly controlled with a goal systolic blood pressure between 100 and 120 due to her Type B aortic dissection.
Again, neurological examination showed some mild right upper extremity weakness with four out of five strength proximally but no pronator drift on examination.
A repeat chest CT angiogram was performed which showed no involvement of the aortic arch to suggest dissection to the carotids.
An MRI / MRA of the brain was obtained which showed possible narrowing of the left posterior cerebral artery and inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery origin, but the study was severely limited by motion.
Neurology recommended aiming for the highest systolic blood pressure possible in the goal range for aortic dissection, which is 120.
They also recommended doing studies of her carotids.
At the time of discharge, the patient's neurologic findings were resolving but her walking was still limited by the right lower extremity weakness.
Work-up included as follows: Plain x-rays of the hand showed findings most consistent with osteoarthritis.
They felt that her physical examination findings were most consistent with osteoarthritis and recommended continuing Vioxx.
Abdomen CT angiogram showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis in her one remaining renal artery.
The patient is asked to follow-up with her primary care physician for strict control of her blood pressure.
