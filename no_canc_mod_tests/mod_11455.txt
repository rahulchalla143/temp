Coronary artery disease--status post left anterior    descending and obtuse marginal stent.
Right carotid stenosis--status post carotid    endarterectomy.
ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname 41672**] is an 83-year- old woman, with a history of congestive heart failure, who was found to have aortic stenosis during her cardiac work-up, for which she was scheduled to have elective repair.
She also notably had increasing episodes of angina, and on her cardiac catheterization was found to have 60% disease of her right coronary, 30% disease of the diagonal, and 80% to the PDA, with an ejection fraction of 60%.
Her aortic valve area was about 0.3 cm to 0.4 cm on her preoperative catheterization.
Given her constellation of symptoms and her multiple exacerbations, she was admitted to the hospital for elective repair.
On her initial examination, her weight was 128 pounds, pulse 64 in sinus rhythm, with a blood pressure of 110/65.
Her hematocrit was 39, and her BUN and creatinine were 15 and 1.7.
Her cardiopulmonary bypass time was 102 minutes, and her crossclamp time was 82 minutes.
She was subsequently transferred to the    intensive care unit for more aggressive monitoring and, in    fact, required BIPAP ventilation.
The remainder of her hospitalization was notable for significant output from the right and left chest tubes of 500 cc to 1,000 cc per day.
Analysis of this fluid revealed it to be a transudate without any evidence of an infective process.
By the time of her discharge, Ms. [**Known lastname 41672**] was satting 94% on room air.
She did have some decreased breath sounds at the bases with the presence of mild bilateral pleural effusions which had been stable on serial chest imaging.
Her congestive heart    failure was managed with aggressive diuresis and afterload    reduction with ACE inhibitors.
Her repeat    echocardiogram showed that her ejection fraction was    normal at greater than 65%.
Her CHF, as noted, was    managed with a combination of beta blockers and ACE    inhibitors.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: The patient was, as    noted, significantly volume overloaded in the initial    postoperative period.
Her preoperative weight was 58.2 kg.
RENAL: The patient's baseline creatinine was between 1.3    to 1.6, which it remained throughout most of her    hospitalization.
Prior to her    discharge, her BUN and creatinine were 35 and 1.4.
She    never became anuric and, as noted, her creatinine had    normalized prior to discharge, and she was making adequate    volumes of urine.
She was afebrile with a pulse in the 70s, systolic blood pressure of 115, with an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air.
She was near her preoperative weight at 59.6 kg (preoperative weight 58.2 kg).
Her exam was remarkable for a sharp II/VI systolic ejection murmur, and otherwise decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Her BUN and creatinine prior to discharge were 35 and 1.4 with a bicarbonate of 40.
Her white blood cell count was 7.3 with a hematocrit of 36.
Her chest x-ray was remarkable for bilateral pleural effusions with some atelectasis, and her EKG was in sinus rhythm.
