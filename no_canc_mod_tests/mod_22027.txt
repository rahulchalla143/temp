In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.0 P114 BP105/70 R93-94% 2LNC O2 sat.
CT torso obtained given recent instrumentation that showed airspace opacities in right, middle, and upper lobes, c/w aspiration and pneumonia.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**3-16**] CT Torso: 1.
Impression: Erythema, congestion and friability in the antrum compatible with gastritis.
Continue to monitor Hct and transfuse to Hct>26.
CTA abdomen/pelvis ([**3-17**]): The lung bases demonstrate scattered patchy opacities which are more prominent on the right and may represent small foci of pneumonia.
The liver, spleen, adrenals, pancreas and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are unremarkable.
CT PELVIS: The rectum, prostate and sigmoid are unremarkable.
CXR ([**3-19**]): Bilateral airspace with greater involvement on the right is slightly improved.
Microbiology: urine cx ([**3-16**]) negative blood cx ([**3-16**]) no growth to date MRSA screen ([**3-16**]) negative Influenza a/b antigen negative ([**3-16**]) C diff toxin negative ([**3-18**])  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 51 y/o M w/ hep C who presented with UGIB after 3d of high dose ibuprofen for new dx of myopericarditis manifested by coffee ground emesis and aspiration pneumonia.
# GI Bleed: Evidence of gastritis and [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear on endoscopy with hematocrits stable after 2 U prbcs given in the ICU.
Sputum culture was contaminated but did not show MRSA so vancomycin discontinued on transfer to medical floor.
Supplemental oxygen was used as necessary to maintain oxygen saturation > 92%.
Tamponade was considered but echocardiogram showed a trivial pericardial effusion.
He tolerated beta blockade once blood pressure and hematocrit were found to be stable.
Echo showed trivial effusion as above.
Surgery evaluated the patient after portal gas was seen on his first CT chest; on repeat CTA the next day, there was no evidence of portal gas.
The patient was C diff toxin negative X 2.
He will need an outpatient colonoscopy once this acute episode resolves.
# Acetabular rim fracture: The patient was found to have a fracture on CT scan of the abdomen.
Once hematocrit stabilized he was started on lovenox 40 mg daily to continue until fully ambulatory.
Your blood counts have been stable since this finding.
