The day after his procedure, he developed some worsening shortness of breath and on chest x-ray was found to have some pulmonary edema.
A code stroke was called he underwent emergent CTA of the head and neck, which showed no demonstrable clot but high grade right ICA stenosis with poor flow.

Head CT shows chronic infarct in the cerebellum, but no evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass effect seen.
CT perfusion demonstrates no definite perfusion defect.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates 60-70% stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery but the evaluation is somewhat limited secondary to exuberant calcification adjacent to the area.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates mild atherosclerotic disease at the left vertebral artery and proximal basilar artery with some dolichoectasia of the left vertebral artery.

A carotid US demonstrated stenosis: R 60-69%, and L stenosis < 40%, but an endarterectomy is not warrented at this time.
Upon discharge, his neuro exam was non-focal.
- Please monitor blood pressure: goal SBP 140's.
His blood pressure was markedly elevated, which may have lead to flash pulmonary edema.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Due to his stroke his blood pressure was allowed to rise, and his rate was difficult to control.
- Please check INR daily until > 2.0.
Then, please check INR twice weekly.
# Hypertension: His blood pressure was permissively high after his CVA with SBP in the 180's.
As he regained neurological function, he was restrated on his blood pressure medications.
He was started on a clonidine patch which helped control his blood pressure.
# Acute kidney injury: He had an elevated Cr that was thought to be scondeary to decreased forward flow.
