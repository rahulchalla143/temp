Unsuccessful cervical MRA, due to apparent patient intolerance of gadolinium contrast material.
TTE [**2164-8-20**]: IMPRESSION: Marked symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mild global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.
In addition, we started pt on simvasatin 40mg QD for an LDL of 170.
# ID: pt initially presented with a leukocytosis at 12, which increased to 18.8 after receving a dose of steroids when it was initially suspected that his PICA infarct was a mass (later proved false by further imaging).
He will need to be monitored for change in his neurological exam to ensure the medication does not precipitate bleeding.
We monitored your condition, and were able to send you home when you were stabilized.
Followup Instructions: You have an appointment with your PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 35914**] at 12:20pm on [**8-28**].
