At [**Hospital3 59738**] SBP was 170's to 180's.
CBC and electrolytes were unremarkable.
A Head CT was performed that showed a 1x2 (at largest dimensions) L thalamic bleed with mild surrounding edema  but no evidence of herniation.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

She likely lives at a higher mean BP than average, so would also be careful about not running  her pressures too low (goal SBP>110) with concern about compromising cerebral perfusion RESP: monitor sats, pt stable FEN/GI: PO ad lib, protonix ENDO: insulin sliding scale to maximize blood glucose control ID: would send blood cultures x3 to r/o endocarditis, pan culture if spikes.
TOX: urine and serum tox screens, particularly to evaluate for drugs causing hypertension  Pt weaned off of antihypertensive drips overnight of HD #1 and was transferred to the floor on [**10-15**] in stable condition.
While on the floor, her blood pressure remained in good range.
