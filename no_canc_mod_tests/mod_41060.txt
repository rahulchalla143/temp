He was admitted last week with congestive heart failure and was dizzy during his admission with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s that was felt to be secondary to his medications.
It was suspected that his ventricular arrhythmias were due to some active ischemia and recommended an ET consult before catheterization for question of ET ablation or AV nodal ablation.
He had a cardiac catheterization done which showed an ejection fraction of approximately 20%, 30% left main lesion, 70% LAD lesion, 70% circumflex lesion with an 80% lesion of the major OM branch, and a 90 to 95% lesion of the right coronary artery.
His left ventricular and diastolic pressure was 17.
He has 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally, 2+ radial pulses bilaterally, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulse on the left with nonpalpable dorsalis pedis pulse on the right and 1+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative labs as follows:  White count 6.0, hematocrit 37.9, platelet count 141,000, sodium 133, potassium 3.9, chloride 98, bicarbonate 27, BUN 11, creatinine 0.7, blood sugar 258, PT 15.4, INR 1.6, PTT 36.7 on Heparin, ALT 28, AST 14, alkaline phosphatase 56, amylase 51, total bilirubin 0.7.
Arterial blood gas on 2 liters nasal cannula was 7.40/46/169.
On [**2114-10-21**], day prior to surgery, his exam was relatively unchanged.
On the morning of surgery his INR dropped to 1.4, and on [**2114-10-22**] he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with an endarterectomy with a right coronary artery grafts as follows:  LIMA to LAD vein graft to OM and vein graft to PDA.
He had a T-max of 98.6.
His first set of postoperative labs showed a white count of 11.2, hematocrit 29.8, and a platelet count of 109,000, sodium of 34, potassium 4.7, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25, BUN 8, creatinine 0.7, with blood sugar of 98.
An HIT panel was sent and was pending for his noticeable drop in platelet count.
Chest x-ray was repeated, and the plan was to continue to wean his Dobutamine and discontinue his Swan, and start the diuresis.
On postoperative day two his hematocrit was 33.7 with a white count of 11.8.
His BUN and creatinine remained stable.
His chest tubes were discontinued, and he was seen by Electrophysiology service, who evaluated him for the possibility of ICD.
On postoperative day three he went back into atrial fibrillation and his blood pressure was low but stable.
His heart rate was up approximately 98 with a blood pressure of 92/70.
His heart rate continued to be regular.
The plan was to have him cardioverted by EP on [**2114-10-25**] and then do a CT study the following day secondary to his presenting V-tach, and he continued on Digoxin which was now added into his regimen with the Carvedilol.
His exam was unremarkable.
On postoperative day number five it was noted that he had a 21-beat episode of V-tach with a heart rate of approximately 150 a minute, which immediately slowed down.
His INR rose from 1.2 to 1.3 after his first dose of Coumadin, was seen again by EP, and continued to work on improving his stamina.
On [**2114-10-29**] the INR was 1.2.
On the day of discharge his potassium was 4.7, BUN 15, creatinine 0.9, magnesium 2.1.
His INR was 1.4.
Coumadin 5 mg with INR check scheduled for Friday, [**2114-11-2**], at Dr.[**Name (NI) 93912**] office for INR and Coumadin check and a goal INR of 2 to 2.5.
