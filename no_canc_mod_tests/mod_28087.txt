Multiple air-fluid levels are seen within the colon and small bowel which are unchanged compared to prior study.
PROCEDURE:  Exploratory laparotomy and right liver lobe laceration repair (hepatorrhaphy).
He was tachycardiac and after 2 liters of fluid boluses was still tachycardiac, as well as a finding on formal ultrasound FAST examination showing free fluid within Morison pouch.
These things taken together prompted the trauma surgical service to take the patient to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy.
Preprocedural time-out was done, and then using a #10 blade an incision was made about 3 cm below the xiphoid process in the midline, through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, taking it and curving around to the left of the umbilicus and down another 3 cm below the umbilicus in the midline sharply.
Approximately 300 cc of blood loss was estimated with initial suctioning, and once this was completed, we did also enter the lesser sac and examined the posterior aspect of the stomach, as well as the visualized portions of the pancreas.
We did have some bleeding from the underlying fascia and abdominal wall where the stab incisions were, and we did put 3 figure-of-eight 2-0 Vicryl sutures there for hemostasis which controlled that well.
This was again inspected, and hemostasis was visualized, and we felt comfortable that we had excluded any other intra-abdominal injuries, and the injury leading to the patient's initial blood loss was controlled and definitively taken care of.
The incision was then subsequently cleansed and dressed with an occlusive sterile dressing, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
Sponge, needle and instrument counts were correct x2.
Urine output was 500 cc.
Estimated blood loss was approximately 350 cc total.
