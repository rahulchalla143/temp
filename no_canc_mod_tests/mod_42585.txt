Admission Date:  [**2128-9-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2128-9-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2078-12-5**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Location (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old female with type 2 diabetes, insulin dependent, history of Graves' disease, hyperthyroidism, asthma, hepatitis C, obesity, inflammatory arthritis, migraines, and a questionable history of inflammatory bowel disease who presents to the Emergency Department [**2128-9-23**] from the [**Hospital **] Clinic with blood sugars reported in the 800s.
Patient was seen, followed at the [**Last Name (un) **] for blood sugar control when it was noticed that she was found to be profoundly hyperglycemic.
Hepatitis C. 7.
NPH 80 a.m., 70 p.m. 2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs: 97.4, blood pressure 126/60, pulse 84, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 99% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count was 5.5, hematocrit 43.5, platelets 313.
Urinalysis was notable for a specific gravity of 1.
Blood sugar is 369, which reportedly is down from 842 and 792 at the [**Hospital **] Clinic.
Anion gap was 9.
CK was 42.
Troponin was less than 0.01.
TSH, T3, T4 were pending.
Chest x-ray was read as normal.
EKG showed no acute changes associated with ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 49-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, insulin dependent, with severe insulin resistance and also a reported history of insulin antibodies questioning diagnosis type 1 versus type 2 diabetes, history of hyperthyroidism, hypertension, asthma, and marked obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, who presented to the Emergency Department and was treated initially for hyperglycemic with blood sugars reported to be greater than 800.
Hyperglycemia:  Patient had reported blood sugars as high as 842.
By the morning of [**2128-9-24**] the insulin drip was discontinued and the patient was restarted on her home insulin regimen with continued close monitoring of her blood sugar.
Hypotension:  Over the course of the first 24 hours of her hospital stay, the patient became profoundly hypotensive on the floor on [**2128-9-24**] and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure and hemodynamic management.
That is why she was transferred to the Unit for closer hemodynamic monitoring, where she was given additional liters of intravenous fluid with normalization of her blood pressure.
With her blood pressure stabilized she was transferred back from the Intensive Care Unit on [**2128-9-25**] to the floor for continued management of her oscillating hyper and hypoglycemia.
Hyperglycemia:  This is a patient who presents with repeated history of hyperglycemia complicated by a failure to adequately control her blood sugars.
However, in house with decreased caloric consumption and closer blood sugar monitoring, this seemed to adequately control the patient's blood sugar.
During her inpatient stay her hyperthyroidism was not treated aggressively, and she has subsequently been scheduled for outpatient follow up with an uptake study and possible ablation if this is determined necessary.
NPH 50 a.m., 54 p.m. 2.
