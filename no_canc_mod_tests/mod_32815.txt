IMAGING: [**1-9**] CT ABD/PELVIS: COMPARISONS: Renal ultrasound exam of [**2200-1-3**].
FINDINGS: CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Small bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions are noted with adjacent areas of compressive atelectasis.
Evaluation of abdominal visceral organs is limited due to lack of intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE PELVIS: Foley is in place with small amount of air locules within the bladder lumen, which is likely related to its placement.
[**Month (only) 116**] assess further with ultrasound exam if clinically indicated.
#Diarrhea: Her stool studies were negative for all bacterial pathogens so it is possible that this was virally mediated vs. medication-side effects from ciprofloxacin.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were discontinued on day #2 of admission given negative micro workup and stable hemodynamics.
Her creatinine was improving to 5.9 on discharge and her tacrolimus level was therapeutic.
Her tacrolimus was decreased to 2 mg po BID, mycophenolate continued at 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Continued Atovaquone, nystatin, and valgancyclovir ppx.
# Anemia and leukopenia: She has these chronically, with baseline Hct around 30 and has had episodes of leukopenia in the past as well.
These will be further monitored as an outpatient.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Check labs [**Hospital1 **] including CBC, Cr, bicarbonate, potassium, tacrolimus level and follow-up with renal   Medications on Admission: Medications:  from last discharge summary as he does not know his medications 1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2  times a day).
Novolog 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: as directed units Subcutaneous three times a day: FBS 100-150=2U 151-200=4U 201-250=6U 251-300=8U, 301-350=10U.
You were initially admitted to the hospital for high blood sugars because of diffuse diarrhea and dehydration.
You were aggressively rehydrated and your blood glucose and blood pressures normalized.
Your low blood pressure was thought to contribute to kidney damage.
After receiving fluids your kidney function stablized and your urine output picked up.
