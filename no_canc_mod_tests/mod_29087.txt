CT abd/pelvis: 1.
CXR showed questionable infiltrate, so unclear if his bacteremia was from a pulmonary or biliary source.
Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for presumed acute cholangitis and abd CT at OSH consistent with this diagnosis.
A repeat CTabd however showed no evidence of biliary obstruction or cholangitis, and patient was asymptomatic so this was cancelled.
His ALT/AST remained slightly elevated, but his bilirubin remained normal and he tolerated a low fat diet.
He underwent an MRCP then to f/u on his ?PSC, the preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] of this showed "bead on a string" appearance consistent with PSC.
Stool cx negative and C Diff negative.
Hct remained stable.
