If there is clinical concern for a fracture, further imaging with a dedicated rib series would be advised.

Recommend non-emergent renal ultrasound for further characterization   Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a complicated PMH including DM2, HTN, HL, CKD, CAD, breast cancer s/p L mastectomy, and rectal cancer s/p hemicolectomy ~15 years ago, with R SHD s/p unwitnessed fall, transferred to MICU now in setting of hematemesis, falling Hct, worsening abdominal pain, and developing hypotension.
Repeat imaging with head CT on [**2005-12-21**], showed no evidence of new mass effect, hemorrhage, or infarct.
Neurosurgery was consulted who recommended care in the MICU and monitoring with follow-up CT images.
Ms [**Known lastname 5239**], was subsequently transferred to the floor where repeat head CT on [**2102-12-24**] showed no active changes.
Patient was hemodynamically stable, but transferred to the MICU for evaluation for urgent endoscopy.
drip and on [**2102-12-25**]  During her hospitalization, her hematocrits were monitored, her ASA and antihypertensives were held and she was monitored closely on telemetry.
Her Hct levels subsequently increased to 29.4 on [**2102-12-25**] and 30.9 on [**2102-12-26**].
She would benefit from repeat HCT check in a few days.
# ABDOMINAL PAIN: Ms [**Known lastname 5239**] complained of RUQ abdominal pain on exam.
She may benefit from an outpatient endoscopy once her SDH resolves.
Troponins were elevated to 0.73 upon admission and peaked to 1.13 on [**2102-12-26**].
Multiple serial EKGs were done which showed inferior ischemia with one isolated ST elevation in III upon admission that later resolved with rate control.
Her enzyme elevations were strongly felt by the team to be secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of SDH, upper GI bleed, ICU admission, and NOT due to plaque rupture.
Given her recent medically managed STEMI in [**8-21**], no further imaging tests were done and the patient was medically managed with 1 unit of PRBCs bring her HCT to 30, continue her metoprolol, and restarting asa 81 and isosorbide on [**2102-12-26**], and continuing her statin.
Patient's imaging this admission reveals pulmonary edema, which overall is improving.
Her alprazolam was held.
Cr was 2.7 on admission, though has since trended down to 2.4 (which is approximate baseline).
Patient's creatinine and electrolytes were trended.
Speech and swallow: she passed her video swallow study and S/S recommended pureed diet until she gets her dentures back along with thin liquids.
Patient is discharged to an extended care facility   Medications on Admission: Acetaminophen 325-650mg Q6H prn pain Aspirin 81mg daily Alprazolam 0.125mg [**Hospital1 **] Betamethasone/clotrimazole 0.05/1% 1 appl [**Hospital1 **] Bumetanide 3mg daily Colace 100mg [**Hospital1 **] Epogen 20,000 units SC weekly Iron 325mg [**Hospital1 **] Flonase nasal spray 2 sprays daily, spray into each nostril Hydralazine 20mg Q8H Isosorbide mononitrate 15mg daily Metoprolol tartrate 50mg [**Hospital1 **] Nitroglycerin 0.4mg SL prn CP Nystatin powder prn Omeprazole 20mg daily Pravastatin 80mg daily Vitamin B12 1000 mcg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. hydralazine 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours.

During your hospitalization, you showed significant improvement and repeat CT scans demonstrated no further bleeding in your head.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
