Echocardiogram [**2147-2-24**]: EF>65%, severe AS with area 0.8 .
CXR PA/Lat [**2147-2-27**]: Small posterior stable effusions versus pleural thickening.
CXR portable [**2147-2-24**]: ?
Echocardiogram was performed on [**2147-2-24**] which showed EF>65% and severe aortic valve stenosis.
Cardiac: Patient had coronary artery disease and underwent catheterization with intervention (DES in rPL).
There was no evidence of MI on ECG and cycled cardiac enzymes were flat.
Echocardiogram [**2147-2-24**] revealed EF>65% with severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8).
Also, vasodilators and preload reduction should be avoided.
The likely source is the lung with CXR on [**2-24**] post extubation suggestive of a right lower lobe opacity near an effusion.
Repeat CXR on day of discharge was negative for pneumonia or CHF.
Hematocrit was stable at discharge.
It decreased post cath and required transfusion of PRBCs to return to goal of over 30. .
