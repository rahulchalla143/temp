Extensive right rectus sheath hematoma extending into the extraperitoneal pelvis and also the retroperitoneum, not significantly changed since examination one day prior performed [**2112-7-29**].
Please continue 1:1 supervision to assist with feeding and monitor swallow safety.
Continue 1:1 supervision to assist with feeding and monitor swallow safety.
Please continue to monitor at rehab and recommend repeat speech and swallow evaluation prior to upgrading diet.
She was monitored initially in the SICU and required intubation for airway protection with GCS [**7-13**] (extubated successfully on [**2112-7-25**]).
Repeat head CT upon admission showed no evidence of acute bleed.
She was monitored with contiuous EEG initially.
RECTUS SHEATH HEMATOMA: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a Hct of 19 and was transfused 2 units RBC on admission.
On the fifth hospital day, Ms. [**Known lastname **] complained of abdominal pain prompting abdominal CT on [**2112-7-29**] that showed a large rectus sheath hematoma on the right side.
Hct dropped from ~30 to 26 and she was subsequently transfused 2 units RBC's, though she remained hemodynamically stable.
An abdominal binder had been placed on [**2112-7-30**] to help control the bleed.
Her hematocrit stabilized at ~29 by [**2112-7-31**] and was 28.7 upon discharge on [**2112-8-3**].
A lower PTT goal of 60-70 was recommended by cardiology due to the recent bleed.
Goal INR is 2.5 - 3.5 for mechanical valve.
VOLUME OVERLOAD: Patient was noted to be short of breath at rest and volume overloaded on exam in the setting of multiple blood transfusions and IVF for CT contrast exposure.
CXR was consistent with volume overload.
Recent TTE from [**2112-7-18**] showed EF 60%; echo was not repeated this admission.
She was weaned from 2LNC to room air and appeared euvolemic on exam prior to discharge.
PNEUMONIA, LEUKOCYTOSIS: Throughout most of her stay, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a persistent leukocytosis of 15-20 and a 2L NC oxygen requirement that was thought to be due to a pneumonia, though no clear infiltrate was identified on CXR.
She was started empirically on vancomycin + ceftriaxone on [**2112-7-27**] for HAP and then switched empirically to vancomycin + zosyn on [**2112-7-28**] since her leukocytosis persisted.
Upon transfer to the medicine service on [**2112-7-30**], her WBS was still elevated at 17 and her O2 requirement remained at 2L, though she had been afebrile.
Blood and urine cultures as well as CXR were repeated for an infection work-up.
All cultures were negative, including a stool C diff from [**2112-8-2**] (when she finally had a BM).
CXR from [**2112-7-31**] showed a LLL infiltrate c/f pneumonia.
RLE ultrasound was performed since she was considered to be at risk for DVT with her immoblization and being off anticoagulation for several days; the ultrasound was negative for DVT.
X-ray of the foot and ankle were nagtive for fracture and showed generalized soft tissue swelling.
Please see results of video swallow study and recommendations in the pertinent results section of this summary.

Coumadin 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5.
Labs Please monitor CBC and INR daily beginning on [**2112-8-4**] until stable.
SBP in the 120's, breathing comfortably on room air.
Your blood counts were a little low, so you were given a blood transfusion.
Followup Instructions: (1) Please call your primary care doctor to be seen for follow-up 1-2 weeks after you are discharged from the rehab facility.
You will need a non-contrast head CT that day prior to talking to the doctor, and they are also scheduling this for you.
