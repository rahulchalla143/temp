Approximately one to two days prior to admission, he developed a fever to 104.0 F., tachycardia with heart rate to the 150s and hypotension with systolic blood pressure to the 60s.
He was brought to the Emergency Department and was placed on the MUST protocol as his white blood cell count was 43,000, he was febrile and hypotensive.
A right internal jugular central line was placed in the Emergency Department and he was given initially five liters of intravenous fluids and was placed on Levophed to support his blood pressure into the mid 90s.
He was also found to have a positive troponin of 0.26 with flat CKs.
Initial infectious work-up was positive for urinalysis with over 50 white blood cells and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for suspected urosepsis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his temperature was 95.4 F.; blood pressure 130/62 on Levophed; heart rate 72 to 79; on assist controlled 500 at a rate of 12 with 5 of PEEP, over breathing the vent 10 to 12.
Lungs were clear to auscultation anterior and laterally.
Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm.
LABORATORY:  Initially significant for a white blood cell count of 43.4, hematocrit 31.2, platelets 369.
Initial Chem-7 notable for a sodium of 140, potassium 3.0, chloride 89, bicarbonate 43, BUN and creatinine 70 and 2.7, glucose of 125.
Initial cardiac enzymes notable for a troponin of 0.26, but a CK of 18; follow-up troponin trended down, 0.16.
Urinalysis was notable for cloudy urine, negative nitrite, moderate leukocyte esterase, more than 50 red blood cells, more than 50 white blood cells with moderate bacteria, zero to two epithelials.
Initial arterial blood gas was 7.38, 76, 149.
Chest x-ray showing stable postoperative changes; small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Previous cardiac catheterization in [**2139-6-2**] showing clean coronaries except for mild coronary artery disease in left circumflex of 30 to 40% lesion.
His temperature after the first 24 hours was within normal limits.
After the patient's blood pressure stabilized, he became afebrile and his urine culture returned as infective pseudomonas, he was taken off steroids and placed on Zosyn for pseudomonas coverage.
Pseudomonas was also cultured from his sputum and was thought to be a colonization.
A Foley catheter was continued during his inpatient hospital stay but he will likely need an outpatient urology evaluation and / or possible transurethral resection of the prostate procedure as indwelling Foley catheter may increase his risk for recurrent urinary tract infections and / or future episodes of urosepsis.
Because of air leak around the cuff of his tracheostomy, his tracheostomy was changed to a Portex #7.
His CKs were flat and he had a previous cardiac catheterization showing fairly clean coronary arteries.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient had a swallowing study to evaluate his ability to take a p.o.
