[**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **] MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *5.8 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.7 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.5 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 20% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Ascending: 2.8 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aorta - Descending Thoracic: 2.1 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 64 mm Hg Aortic Valve - LVOT Diam: 1.9 cm Aortic Valve - Valve Area: *0.4 cm2 (nl >= 3.0 cm2) INTERPRETATION: Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular systolic function is markedly improved.
The effective orifice area (EOA) is about 1.2 cm2 and the maximum gradient is about 38 mm Hg with a cardiac output near 6 l/m.
A perivalvular jet is not obvious but poor windows prevent complete exclusion.
[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN: ([**Numeric Identifier 73141**])   RADIOLOGY  Final Report CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2134-7-19**] 9:09 AM CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE Reason: Pre-op Eval for aortic valve repair [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old woman with Aortic Stenosis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Pre-op Eval for aortic valve repair Carotid duplex series in a 75-year-old woman with aortic stenosis.
Preop evaluation of the carotids.
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed on the bilateral carotid arteries.
On the left, the peak systolic velocities are as follows: 52/14 in the proximal ICA, 35/10 in the mid ICA and 48/12 in the distal ICA.
In the ER she was intubated and found at that time to have EKG chaanges(new LBBB) andelevated TropT(1.91).
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.
At [**Hospital1 **] patient had cardiac cath that showed no sig CAD, sevAS [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 109**] 0.38cm2.
A f/u echo showed sev AS  and mod MR w/EF 20-25%.
