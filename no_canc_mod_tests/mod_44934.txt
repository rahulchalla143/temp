When EMS arrived they found the patient with an O2 sat of 85% on room air.
In the Emergency Department the patient was found to be in respiratory distress with a respiratory rate in the 40s, tachypneic, lethargic, mildly confused, weak and using accessory muscles for inspiration.
His O2 sat was 90% on 100% nonrebreather.
Chest x-ray revealed a question of right lower lobe and left lower lobe infiltrates.
See Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] pulmonary function tests in [**2109-9-15**], which showed decreased FVC, decreased FEV1, 58% predicted, consisted with a restrictive pattern.
Heart rate 81, atrial fibrillation.
Blood pressure 106/58.
Respiratory rate 15.
Arterial blood gas 7.38, 43, 140.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 3.3, hematocrit 37.3, sodium 136, potassium 4.2, chloride 102, bicarb 25, BUN 28, creatinine 1.0, glucose 179.
Calcium, magnesium and phos 10.2, 1.8 and 2.0 respectively.
CK 263, MB 3, troponin less then 0.3.
The differential on the white blood cell count was 70 neutrophils, 10 bands.
Blood cultures were sent, sputum cultures and urine cultures were also sent.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120s.
In terms of his renal function he was prerenal given a BUN and creatinine ratio greater then 20, so the goal was to obtain a urine output greater then 30 cc an hour.
He was hyperkalemic and hypophosphatemic, which was consistent with a hyperparathyroid picture and we continued to fluid replete and follow his electrolytes for this.
Temperature spike was up to 101.3, so blood cultures were sent.
His examination remained unchanged and the rest of the cultures were still pending.
We changed his antibiotics from Levaquin and Ceftazidime to Vancomycin.
On hospital day number three EP was asked to see the patient due to atrial fibrillation that had now slowed down to a rate of 52.
An echocardiogram was obtained, which showed an EF of 55% with mild aortic regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation.
His white count was steadily increasing from 3.3 up to 8, however, it was still considered to be in significant central [**Doctor Last Name **] was changed over the wire due to a question of increasing white blood cells.
A chest CT was obtained and it showed bibasilar dense opacities consistent with aspiration, small bilateral pleural effusions.
The sedation was weaned off and the patient's vital signs remained stable.
His white count on hospital day number ten was decreasing to 5.2.
His hematocrit was found to be 31.5.
A bronchoscopy was performed on hospital day number fourteen and showed moderate secretions in the left bronchus that were cleared.
The patient was extubated on hospital day number sixteen and his O2 sats remained in the high 90s on a face mask.
His white count improved to 4.7.
His BUN and creatinine improved to 17 and 0.9.
He was afebrile and vital signs were stable with a pulse of 95 and had heart rate that was irregular.
However, during the night the patient self extubated with a blood gas of 7.36/54, and 113 and the decision was made that the patient looked well after self extubating with an O2 sat of 99% on room air and the decision was made that we did not need to reintubate the patient.
A head CT was performed that was consistent with prior microvascular disease and no further studies were necessary.
His white count remained within normal limits at 12.4.
His BUN and creatinine remained stable at 8 and 0.7 respectively and his atrial fibrillation remained rate controlled as he was anticoagulated.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Return if shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and any difficulty breathing at all.
