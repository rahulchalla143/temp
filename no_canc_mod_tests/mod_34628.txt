His hematocrits were followed closely; initial HCT was 42.2 and has slowly drifted downward secondary to acute blood loss associated with his injuries and surgeries.
The rest of his hospital stay was uneventful with his lab data and vital signs within normal limits, his radial nerve palsy is improving, and his pain controlled.
