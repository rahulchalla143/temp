She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
This revealed three-vessel disease and an EF of 50 percent, including the left main 50- 70 percent, LAD 70 percent ostial lesion, left circumflex that was small and totally occluded and an RCA that was also totally occluded.

Her bypass time was 89 minutes and a cross clamp of 50 minutes.
At the time of transfer, the patient was A paced at 90 beats per minute with a mean arterial pressure of 66 and a CVP of 12.
Following initiation of beta blockade, the patient was noted to have sinus pauses with a heart rate down to the 30's and, therefore, she remained in the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
On postoperative day three, the patient remained hemodynamically stable with a heart rate in the 70s, sinus rhythm.
At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical exam is as follows.
Vital signs temperature 98, heart rate 85, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 160/80, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 95 percent on room air.
