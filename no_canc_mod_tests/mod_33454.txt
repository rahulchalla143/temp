Past Medical History: -Coronary artery disease:cardiac catheterization on [**2137-2-7**] revealed 3VD, right dominant system with a left main 30% lesion, LAD 70% lesion, left circumflex lesion showed diffuse disease, RCA had 70% stenosis, and EF was recorded as 75% with a PA mean of 43 -Mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation (moderate to severe) -Hypertension -Pulmonary hypertension -Obesity -Carotid artery disease: carotid ultrasound, which showed her left internal carotid artery stenosis to be between 50-69% and right internal carotid artery stenosis to be less than 50%.
