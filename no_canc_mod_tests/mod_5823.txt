Initial response was an increased sinus rate to 120 with consistent 2:1 block.

EKG [**2128-7-17**]: 2:1 AVB, rate 60; sl LAD .
EKG [**2128-7-20**]: A-V paced rhythm Since previous tracing of [**2128-7-18**], Atrium now paced with A-V pacing .
CXR [**2128-7-17**]: mild vasc engorgement, raised R hemidiaphragm (old)  .
CXR [**2128-7-20**]: Temporary pacer lead has been removed.
TTE ([**6-19**]): EF 65-70%, sLVH, 1+ MR, 1+ TR, 1+ AR .
ETT-MIBI ([**3-22**]): EF 60%; 1.
Initially the setting was as follows: paced at low of 0.5mA with sensitivity 3.0mV.
A CXR confirmed proper placement of the pacemaker and its leads and the pacemaker was interrogated demonstrating appropriate capture.
INR should be followed closely and coumadin levels should be adjusted to achieve a goal INR of [**3-19**].
# ARF: The pt has a baseline Cr of 1.0-1.5, which was elevated up to 2.3 on admission.
Urine lytes on admission consistent with pre-renal azotemia.
Her ACEI and diuretic were initially held on admission due to the ARF and creatinine and urine output followed closely.
Her renal function and urine output shouuld be followed closely in rehab with routine chemistries.
# Anemia: HCT was 27.9 on admission which then dropped to 24 after pacer placement (moderate procedural blood loss).
She was subsequently transfused 2 U PRBCs from [**Date range (1) 26325**] (lasix 40 mg iv between units) with some response.
# Urinary retention: Her foley catheter was removed after her UA and urine culture returned positive for a UTI.
Plain X-rays of the left foot and ankle were performed which demonstrated degenerative changes on the medial and lateral malleoli, however, there was no evidence of a fracture.
