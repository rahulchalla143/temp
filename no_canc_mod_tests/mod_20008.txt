Pt recently had cardiac cath in [**2-11**] for anginal symptoms resulting in PCI with cypher stents placed in the Left Circumflex and LAD.
Initial EKG at OSH showed afib, prominent ST elev in v2-v6, 1, and aVL, and ST depressions in inferior leads.
Catherization at [**Hospital1 18**] showed 100% proximal stent restenosis, diffuse RCA disease, and a patent Left Circumflex stent.
Enzymes post catherization: CPK 4741, Troponin 14.95.
Of note, Persantine MIBI [**9-12**] showed small fixed inferior defect with slight atypical redistribution suggestive of ischemia.
Echo also done [**9-12**] showed normal LVEF of 60%, concentric LVH, and moderate MR.   Past Medical History: CAD  -s/p PCI to L circ and LAD in [**2-11**]  -s/p MI [**04**] years ago  -[**9-12**]: pMIBI showed a small fixed inferior defect with slight  apical redistribution suggestive of ischemia.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2198-12-22**] 10:38 AM  INDICATION: Large ST elevation with myocardial infarction.
Hematocrit drop.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are small bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis.
Evaluation of the abdominal organs is limited without IV contrast.
The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, stomach, and bowel loops are all unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is minimal stranding adjacent to both femoral arteries and veins, related to prior vascular punctures.
ECHO  GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be estimated.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a 100% proximal stenosis within the LAD stent.
Hemodynamics showed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a mean RA pressure of 18mmHg, PCWP of 28mmHg.
There was evidence of mild to moderate pulmonary HTN with a PAP of 53/30mmHg.
The calculated cardiac index using an assumed O2 consumption was 1.53 Lt/min/m2  consistent with severe cardiogenic shock.
Final angiography revealed residual stenosis throughout the course of the LAD, TIMI-2 fast flow and no dissection.
Immediately post-op patient had chest pain and developed dynamic EKG changes suggestive of a large anterior STEMI (confirmed by enzymes peaking at CPK of 4741 and Troponin of 14.95).
Echo during hospitalization showed EF of 20% with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Lovenox will be used as bridging therapy w/ goal inr 2.0  Rhythm:  History of chronic afib.
C.  Heme Patient's Hematocrit fell below 27 several times during hospitalization, likely secondary to bleeding within knees in the setting of anti-coagulation.
Addominal CT was performed was negative for retro-peritoneal bleed.
F.  Endocrine Patient was put on an Insulin drip post-cath to optimize glucose levels post acute-MI in ICU setting.
Patient's glucose levels stabalized and were managed with sliding scale insulin.
