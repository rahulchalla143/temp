Subsequently head CT was performed which showed evidence of acute on chronic subdural hematoma.
Further anti-coagulation was held and plans were made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
At that time, CT scan of the head showed interval increase in size of the right frontal subdural hypodense collection which measures 8 mm thick at its greatest width, consistent with a chronic subdural hematoma.

RV 'moves good'  [**2115-10-10**] Head CT Today's examination is compared with the prior from [**2115-10-9**].
There are overlying moderate-sized pleural effusions bilaterally  Head CT [**10-19**] stable   Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo M s/p traumatic head injury in [**8-8**] with bifrontal hemmorhage who was transferred from OSH on [**10-9**] with chest pain and dyspnea.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgmt where he was admitted to the MICU service overnight.
While in the MICU, heaprin gtt intially started but then a head CT showed an increased size in the hematoma.
His EKG remained unchanged.
He developed a temp to 101 and a leukocytosis to 15 (from 10).
CXR showed RLL collapse with dense consolidation and moderate B pleural effusions.
CTA chest showed dense consolidation with small PTX.
His oxygen sats improved rapidly as he was able to take deeper breaths and as his pneumonia was treated.
Blood cultures were negative, he was unable to give a sputum sample.
With regard to anticoagulation, subdural hematoma on head CT [**10-14**] looked stable and the decision was made to reattempt anticoagulation on [**10-15**] with heparin nomogram at starting rate 15U/kg no IV bolus and coumadin 3mg.
The evening of [**10-16**] he c/o a strange sensation in his head and repeat head CT showed slight expansion of the lesion with question of some hyperintensity of the hematoma.
w/ B PE on OSH chest CT and in-house chest CT (on re-read).
Interestingly chest CT seems to indicate free-air w/in RLL and also in pleura.

- plan 2 wk course of levoflagyl (from start [**10-11**]) - repeat CTA chest in 6 weeks to confirm resolution of RLL collapse .
# Subdural hematomas: worsened and hemorrhaged initially on heparin; they have since stabilized on CT scan and patient is clinically stable.
# Full code  Patient had repeat head CT [**10-16**] that was stable.
You are being sent home on blood thinners, you need to have your INR checked with your PCP next week.
