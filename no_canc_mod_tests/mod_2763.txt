He does have a significant DVT/PE history, but because he has an IVC filter and INR was supra-therapeutic when his symptoms began, suspicion for PE was low.
Admission Chest CT showed bilateral effusions and bilateral LL opacities, which may represent infection, edema, or atelectasis.
He was unable to complete the IV contrast portion of the CT scan and thus PE could not fully be ruled out.
