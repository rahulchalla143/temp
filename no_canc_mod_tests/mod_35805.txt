HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old male with a history significant for coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2154**], abdominal aortic aneurysm status post endovascular stent graft in [**2165-2-2**] now being evaluated for total occlusion of right iliac limb graft.
On the day prior to admission the patient presented for CT angiogram, which revealed total occlusion of his right limb of his graft with collateral flow from contralateral iliac artery branches.
The patient underwent angiography on the day of admission showing a patent aortic graft with normal left iliac graft limb.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further evaluation with a planned relook catheterization on the following day.
At the time of initial evaluation the patient was comfortable without any pain.
Ejection fraction 28% presumed ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Blood pressure 122/61.
Pulse 74.
Respiratory rate 16.
Extremities have bilateral femoral lines with sheaths and transducers and bilateral Dopplerable pulses.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 5.9, hematocrit 44.1, platelets 267.
Initial angiography showed occluded right limb graft and the patient underwent passage of guidewire through thrombosis and intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator beginning in the catheterization laboratory.
Subsequent relook angiography on [**12-20**] showed successful thrombolysis of the previously occluded right limb aortic stent graft with persistent and widely patent aortic stent graft.
Post intervention the patient was placed on anticoagulation and intravenous heparin later to Coumadin with goal INR change 2.3 to 3.
He will need frequent laboratory checks to ensure that his INR becomes therapeutic.
He did have an episode post second angiography where he was bradycardia and hypotensive into the 70s.
His hematocrit responded appropriately to that and his hematocrit remained stable during the rest of his hospital course, although showed a slight decrease near the end.
He will be using Lovenox as bridging therapy for his Coumadin with goal INR of 2 to 2.5.
He did undergo bilateral groin ultrasounds, which were negative for pseudoaneurysms or fistulas.
The patient was to have his INR checked on [**12-30**] and on [**1-2**] and have results faxed to Dr.[**Name (NI) 3101**] office.
