Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
-Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**1-26**]/201, sustained right atrial collapse is now seen, consistent with possible early tamponade physiology.

Pericardial fluid cytology was negative for malginancy.
[**Doctor First Name **] came back positive with a titer of 1:80 (which can be see in [**9-9**]% of healthy individuals).
