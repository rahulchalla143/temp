On [**4-13**], patient presented to [**Hospital1 **] with cheif complaints of left scapular pain and shortness of breath - diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure, subsequently diuresed, ruled in for NQWMI with troponin up to 11.4, ck 290, 12% R/I.
[**4-17**] cardiac cath showed 3-v native disease (RCA not seen), LIMA to LAD-40-50% mid disease, SVG to LV branch of prox CX: 80% eccentric proximal stenosis which became worse during cath (?
of TIA vs. stroke last Wed [**4-18**] day after cath, with clinical signs of right hand weakness, with no other signs/symptoms since that time and CT scan negative for acute pathology (no MRI done).
An Echo on [**4-18**] showed EF 40-45%.
Vital signs upon transfer BP 170/77, 130/55 post-hydral and lopressor, hr 60s sinus, afebrile, sat 2lnc 98%.
CAD - MI complicated by cardiogenic shock in [**2107**], leading to CABG with LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to PLV 2.
PVD - s/p aortobifemoral bypass graft with left renal artery bypass 4.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm - repaired [**2108**] 5.
Chronic renal insufficiency - baseline Cr 2.5 with acute failure with creatinine rise to 5.0.
Pulmonary hypertension 11.
CV: RRR, S1+S2+S3-S4-, physiologically split S2 on inspiration.
MSK 4+/5 bilaterally, upper extremities and lower extremities.
PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: CXR - Single AP view of the chest in upright position demonstrate patient to be status post CABG.
ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the basal and midventricular segments of the inferior and posterior walls.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
[**2114-4-28**] ECHO  Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-4-24**], the left and right ventricles are now more dilated and left and right ventricular systolic function now appears more depressed.
Non-visualization of the left kidney.

An echocardiogram post-cath showed mild hypokinesis.
Her cardiac enzymes trended down.
She underwent cath without complications and four hours later she went into flash pulmonary edema with no EKG changes.
She diuresed 5 liters on this regimen however her creatinine bumped to >4 (baseline around 2.5.)
On the 12th, she was put on 40 mg PO lasix qd, and she tolerated this regimen well, with appropriate diuresis and creatinine down to 3.5.
Her EKG was unchanged from prior.
She went to CCU with creatinine of 3.5 (up from baseline of 2.5).
As above, lasix was held for 24 hours, then restarted at 40 mg PO qd, with creatinine stabilized at 3.5.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Patient discharged to rehab in stable condition, tolerating PO feeds and fluids, ambulating on her own, chest pain free, no shortness of breath, vital signs stable.
