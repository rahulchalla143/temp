Her K has stabilized and she has been in 1st degree a-v block with a rate in 50s-60s, with good urine output.
# Bradycardia: Pt was initially bradycardic with a junctional rhythm on EKG in the setting of a magnesium of 5.6 on amlodipine therapy.
A repeat EKG showed stable 1st degree heart block.
Pt initially presented with hyperkalemia (K 6.3), hypermagnesemia (Mg 5.6) and hyperphosphatemia (6.0).
The potassium was corrected with glucose/insulin/CaCO/kayexelate, and the magnesium trended down with improved renal function.
With scant stool output Pt underwent aggressive laxative/stool softener/enema therapy as constipation was thought to by contributing to the ongoing nausea.
She subsequently had large stool output and subjectively began to feel much better.
# CHF: Per OSH records pt had a TTE in [**2166**] significant for EF 70%.
CXR showed no pulmonary edema and there was no diastolioc CHF on ECHO ([**12-30**]).
CHF was managed with gentle lasix diuresis with prompt clinical resolution of symptoms.
Her SBP was subsequently in the 130-160 range and EKG showed stable first degree heart block.
