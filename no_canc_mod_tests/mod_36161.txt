Given that aggressive blood pressure lowering has yielded catastrophic results in the past, it was decided to admit him to the Intensive Care Unit for invasive blood pressure monitoring and parenteral therapy.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2, and bilateral renal artery stenosis as described above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  This is a pleasant 65-year-old gentleman in no acute distress who was afebrile with a blood pressure of 186/74 by cuff, and 195/72 by arterial line.
His heart rate was 75.
His head, ears, nose, eyes and throat examination was unremarkable.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed a white blood cell count of 9.2, hematocrit of 26.9, and platelet count of 157.
His sodium was 134, potassium 5.2, chloride 100, bicarbonate 24, blood urea nitrogen 67, and creatinine of 1.2.
His glucose was 226.
His albumin was 3.4.
His calcium was 8.5, magnesium 2, and phosphorous of 2.7.
His coagulations were within normal limits.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with normal axis and normal intervals.
Echocardiogram from [**2170-10-25**], showed an ejection fraction of 45%, with mild left atrial dilatation, and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
His oral antihypertensive medications were held, and he was started on a Nipride drip to keep his systolic blood pressure between 150 and 170.
He had a single episode of chest pain associated with a systolic blood pressure of 220 while on the Nipride drip, so a nitroglycerin drip was added as well.
It resolved quickly after his blood pressure was lowered.
His goal systolic blood pressure is 140 to 160.
He continued to have systolic blood pressures in the 170s to 200s after two days of this regimen, so minoxidil 10 mg p.o.
His systolic blood pressure was initially in the 150s the following day but then dropped into the 130s the day after.
This pressure is most likely too low for him given the range of systolic blood pressures he is typically accustomed to.
If his systolic blood pressure is consistently below 130, he should have his minoxidil stopped.
If he then has systolic blood pressures greater than 170 on a regular basis after stopping the minoxidil, he should have his captopril dose increased to 50 mg t.i.d.
His renal function would most certainly benefit from the stent placement.
RENAL:  His creatinine remained stable at 1 to 1.2 during his entire hospital course.
Of note, a urine culture revealed a Proteus urinary tract infection that was treated with three days of ceftriaxone.
He had no diarrhea during his hospital stay, and his stool was negative for Clostridium difficile toxin times two.
He did have trace guaiac-positive stool on admission, and his hematocrit drifted down over the first few days in the hospital.
He received 2 units of packed red blood cells with good response, and his hematocrit stabilized after that.
He will need a colonoscopy as an outpatient in the future to work up this possible gastrointestinal bleed.
His fingerstick blood sugars were well controlled on his current NPH regimen.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1 to 1.2.
(please monitor blood pressure medications; namely captopril, Lopressor, and minoxidil).
