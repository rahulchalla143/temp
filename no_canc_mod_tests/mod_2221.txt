Differential dx included ateriovenous malformation, aneurysm rupture, mass, hypertension or amyloid (most likely).
On head CT, there was a 4cm x 13 slices right frontal hemorrhage with extension to 3rd ventricle.
Her exam revealed patient intubated, withdrew x 2, right gaze preference, upgoing toes bilaterally.
Repeat head CT [**8-28**] showed no major change.
Concern that she might be seizing, an EEG was performed and showed diffuse cortical dysfunction.
CTA was negative for aneurysm.
Unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker.
