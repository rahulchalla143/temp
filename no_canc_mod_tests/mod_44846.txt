She then demonstrated a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with CPK greater than 1100, and troponin-T of .82.
She underwent echocardiogram and catheterization, which showed three vessel disease with 50 to 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending, and 95% stenosis in the D1, 50% stenosis of the circ, 80% stenosis of the obtuse marginal I, 90% stenosis of the obtuse marginal II, an ejection fraction of 65%, and 4+ mitral regurgitation.
On [**9-15**], she was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management, and was admitted to Cardiothoracic Surgery service.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, blood pressure was 145/65, heart rate 145, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 99%, temperature 97.7, weight 59.4 kg.
LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white count 9.8, hematocrit 37.0, platelets 242.
PT 13.3, PTT 93.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 96, bicarbonate 27, BUN 15, creatinine 0.4, glucose 120.
Calcium 1.05, magnesium 1.9.
A TSH was checked and was within normal limits.
On [**9-21**], she underwent a repeat catheterization, which showed her grafts to be patent, her mitral regurgitation to be decreased to 1 to 2+, and an ejection fraction of 50%.
She was again extubated on [**9-22**], and underwent a swallowing study on [**9-25**], which was positive for aspiration.
On [**9-28**], she again required reintubation for respiratory failure, and she underwent a bronchoscopy which showed aspirated barium from her swallowing study in her right bronchial system.
The patient subsequently had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on the 11th.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed gastritis.
On [**9-29**] as well, the patient had a blood culture return positive for coag negative staph.
On [**9-30**], a Rheumatology consultation was obtained, which concluded that the patient was not having a flare of her dermatomyositis, and she was switched to Solu-Medrol 8 mg intravenously twice a day.
On [**10-1**], the patient had a tracheostomy performed, and a repeat bronchoscopy to check tracheostomy placement and suction secretions.
Chest CT and thoracentesis were recommended.
Prior to the thoracentesis, she had a chest CT which showed multilobar pneumonia, large effusions, consolidation in multiple lobes, bilateral lower lobe collapse.
A CT had been performed prior to her thoracentesis.
Specimens were sent to the Laboratory, which showed cultures all negative at the time of this dictation, and pathology of the biopsy taken during the bronchoscopy showed squamous metaplasia and acute inflammation.
Cultures were followed, which were all negative at the time of this dictation.
The patient's white count was decreasing, and she remained afebrile.
A chest x-ray on [**10-11**] raised a question of a possible area of aerated lung vs. cavity, and the patient underwent repeat CT scan on [**10-12**], which revealed no abscess, but pockets of aerated lung.
