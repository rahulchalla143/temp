[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], on the day of admission for routine appointment at which time he was found to have a hematocrit of 13.0.
CD4 442 on [**2101-6-24**], with a viral load of 100,000 in [**2101-2-12**].
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 101.4, blood pressure 95/50, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 100% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat is normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pulmonary is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities 2 to 3+ edema at the knees bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was 3.3, hematocrit 12.5 (28.7 [**6-14**]), platelet count 182,000.
Sodium 126, potassium 2.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate 16, blood urea nitrogen 12, creatinine 0.8, glucose 97, ALT 9, AST 47, LDH 192, alkaline phosphatase 294, total bilirubin 2.2, albumin 2.0.
Chest x-ray with no evidence of infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit service on [**2101-8-4**], for a low hematocrit of 13.0.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy shortly after admission showed varices in the lower one third of the esophagus with evidence of portal gastropathy, but there was no evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding.
The patient was transfused four units of packed red blood cells in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and had a bone marrow biopsy on [**2101-8-5**].
His anemia was felt to be primarily secondary to blood loss from a chronic lower gastrointestinal bleed, however, he was also found to have low grade hemolysis with an effective reticulocytosis.
His bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow with normal iron stones and a lymphoid predominance consistent with HIV.
The patient had a colonoscopy which showed mucosal friability and ulcers in the region of his previously known sigmoid colitis.
A transthoracic echocardiogram and a transesophageal echocardiogram were both negative and the patient completed a fourteen day course of antibiotics.
He will likely require recurrent outpatient transfusion to maintain his hematocrit and prevent recurrent renal insufficiency.
EPO Alpha 3000 units/ml, 6000 unit injection three times a week.
