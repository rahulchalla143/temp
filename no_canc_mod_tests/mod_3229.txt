Follow-up catheterization in [**3-5**] showed diffuse, severe three vessel disease, almost totally occluded saphenous vein graft to PDA.
Her chest tightness with exertion responded to three sublingual nitroglycerin.
She was referred for coronary catheterization and renal angiography on [**2155-7-4**].
The patient had previously refused renal MRI scan secondary to anxiety.
Early in the a.m. on [**2155-7-4**], her systolic blood pressure increased to 212/73.
The drip rate was 0.3 micrograms per kilogram per minute and was titrated up to 8 cc per hour.
She underwent coronary catheterization on [**2155-7-4**] with cardiac output 5.18, cardiac index 2.70, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 13, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 7.
Catheterization showed LAD occluded proximally, left circumflex with nondominant vessel with previous stent patent with diffuse in-stent restenosis with competitive flow distally filling the saphenous vein graft.
Renal angiography showed eccentric 40% lesion in the right renal artery and no disease in the left renal artery.
The patient was noted to have a large hematoma in her right groin several hours post catheterization on [**2155-7-4**].
The heart rate was 66, blood pressure 144/60, peripheral pulses were Dopplerable.
Expansion of the right groin hematoma was noted.
Repeat hematocrits showed a decline in her hematocrit value from 30 to 24.6.
The patient was given morphine sulfate for pain control which resulted in a drop of her systolic blood pressure from 130s to 90s.
The ultrasound noted an echogenic mass 8.6 times 10.6 cm consistent with right femoral hematoma with pseudoaneurysm formation, an arterial venous communication.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further monitoring.
Repeat catheterization in [**3-5**] with diffuse and severe disease, almost totally occluded saphenous vein graft to PDA.
Colonoscopy in [**3-5**] with edematous polyps and diverticuli.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.6, heart rate 85, normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 124/45, respiratory rate 13, oxygen saturation 91% on room air.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation anterolaterally, well-healed sternotomy scar.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses Dopplerable bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA/X-RAYS, OTHER STUDIES:  Hematocrit 26.0, platelets 245,000.
Serum chemistries with potassium 3.7, BUN 26, creatinine 1.8, patient's baseline creatinine 1.1 to 1.3.
Coagulation profile:  PT 12.5, PTT 22.7, INR 1.0.
EKG:  [**2155-7-5**] (normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per minute), axis at 0 degrees, T wave inversions in leads II, III, aVF.
Coronary catheterization on [**2155-7-4**] (native three vessel disease), left main with no significant obstructive disease, LAD subtotally occluded in midvessel and filled distally via LIMA to LAD, left circumflex 30% narrowing proximally, OM2 with diffuse 70% proximal disease, competitive flow from SVG to OM1/OM2 distally, OM3 70% diffuse disease beyond which had a competitive flow from saphenous vein graft to OM1/OM2.
Saphenous vein graft to OM1/OM2 widely patent, saphenous vein graft to right PDA stump occluded, LIMA to LAD patent, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 4, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure 7.
Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 12.
Femoral ultrasound ([**2155-7-6**]):  Large heterogenous echogenic mass measuring 8.6 by 10.6 cm corresponding to large hematoma.
Additionally, cardiac enzymes were cycled and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Serial EKGs demonstrated no evidence of ischemic changes.
Therefore, she was started on a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, calcium channel blocker, nitrate, diuretic for blood pressure control.
The patient had a normal ejection fraction on stress echocardiogram in [**2152-12-4**] prior to CABG.
We felt that an echocardiogram would be useful to assess her current left ventricular ejection fraction of cardiac function.
Echocardiogram was performed on [**2155-7-7**].
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size were grossly normal.
Left ventricular ejection fraction 60-70%.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
The patient was monitored with serial hematocrits, hemodynamic monitoring in the Coronary Care Unit, and serial peripheral pulse evaluation.
She required multiple transfusions to maintain hematocrit values greater than 30.
Vascular Surgery continued to follow her status post repair with wound checks and general wound care.
She did require additional blood transfusions status post surgical repair to maintain hematocrit values greater than 30.
However, at the time of discharge, she was hemodynamically stable, and hematocrit values were stable for greater than 72 hours above 33.0.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE STATUS POST CORONARY CATHETERIZATION:  On admission to the CCU, the patient's creatinine was evaluated to a value of 1.8, baseline creatinines ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 per the medical record review.
However, evaluation of her urinary electrolytes and urine studies demonstrated evidence of prerenal azotemia.
At the time of discharge, creatinine was down to baseline of 1.0 to 1.1.
fingerstick blood glucose testing and covered with regular insulin sliding scale.
Fingerstick blood glucose testing on the Avandia and insulin 70/30 16 units q.a.m.
The extremity was nontender to palpation, peripheral pulses were intact.
At the time of discharge, her hematocrit value was stable above 33 for 72 hours, with transfusion needs contained.
