He had a cardiac catheterization which showed three vessel disease and a suspected subtotally occluded D1 and /or hazy mild lesion in the proximal-mid LCX at OM2 as the target lesion for his NSTEMI.
An echo during the admission was not able to rule out an LV thrombus.
It was decided not to anticoagulate the patient for the questionable thrombus as the risks outweighed the benefits and he was to have a repeat echo with Definity to further assess the thrombus.
It showed a pericardial effusion and echo signs of tamponade.
He had a pulsus of [**11-9**], and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for drainage.
600cc of blood fluid was drained and patient was sent to CCU for monitoring.

REPORTS Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2134-9-9**] BRIEF HISTORY:   62 y/o male who was transferred from out-patient facility with moderate-large pericardial effusion with early echocardiographic features of temponade.
Initial pericardial pressure 15 mm and 0 mm of Hg atthe end of the procedure.
Repeat echo showed no residual fluid.
TTE [**9-9**] 1600 There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex, apical segments, mid anterior, anteroseptal and lateral walls.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-9-1**], there is now a small to moderate pericardial effusion.
TTE [**9-9**] 1658 There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex, apical segments, mid anterior, anteroseptal and lateral walls.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-9-9**], the pericardial fluid has been largely removed.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o male with PMHx CAD s/p MI in '[**13**] and recent discharge for NSTEMI on [**9-2**], VT s/p AICD placement who presents s/p pericardiocentesis with drain placement after routine echo at cardiologist office showed effusion with echo tamponade.
Follow-up ECHO post-procedure showed trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Pericardial fluid studies showed WBC 9375, protein 5.1, glucose 77, LDH 1838, amylase 46, albumin 3.0; and cytology is still pending.
Patient discharged with plan to have repeat ECHO as outpatient and f/u with Cardiology.
EKG on admission showed no ST-T wave changes.
# Hyperlipidemia - Recent lipid panel [**9-1**] showed total cholesterol of 164, LDL 85, HDL 61.
The output from the drain was minimal so we were able to pull the catheter.
You need to have another echocardiogram next week to see if any fluid has reaccumulated.
We started a medication called losartan which also lowers your blood pressure without the cough as a side effect.
The office will call you on Monday to schedule your appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and your ECHO to rule out pericardial effusion.
Followup Instructions: Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended follow up in the next 2 weeks with ECHO performed in the morning before your appt.
