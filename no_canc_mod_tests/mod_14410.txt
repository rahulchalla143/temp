[**2125-10-2**] Cardiac Catheterization with Successful Angioplasty of an acutely occluded diagonal branch without stenting.
History of Present Illness: This is a 70 year old male transferred from [**Hospital3 **] in cardiogenic shock after undergoing cardiac catheterization which revealed an occlusion in his left anterior descending artery.
An echocardiogram on [**2125-9-25**] showed mild aortic insufficiency, mild aortic stenosis, severe mitral regurgitation and dilated ascending aortic aneurysm.
He was admitted directly to the CSRU, intubated and sedated, for further evaluation and treatment.

[**2125-10-2**] Cardiac Catheterization: Selective left coronary angiography revealed essentially no change from the diagnostic angiogram performed prior to transfer except the notable complete occlusion of the first diagonal branch which was poorly [**Month/Day/Year 48613**] on outside films.
[**2125-10-7**] Groin Ultrasound: There is a large fairly anechoic hematoma in the right groin, with a pseudoaneurysm which is poorly organized and extending over several centimeters.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function maybe depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Remaining study is unchanged from prebypass.
Brief Hospital Course: Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**10-2**] after cardiac catheterization arrest and subsequent resuscitation.
Cardiac cath revealed 3VD w/occluded LAD.
The following day patient had an echo that showed preserved cardiac function and the balloon pump was weaned and removed.
Medications on Admission: Lisinopril 20 qd, Lipitor 40 qd, Metformin 500 [**Hospital1 **], Indocin 25 [**Hospital1 **], Nexium 40 qd, Metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **], Zantac, Aspirin 81 qd, Warfarin, Levofloxacin 250 qod, Lasix, IV Heparin, IV Nitro  Discharge Medications: 1.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: as directed Tablet PO once a day: 5mg Q T-Th-S-S 7.5mg Q M-W-F Target INR 2-2.5.
Patient should have PT/INR checked within 48 hours of discharge.
Goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0.
