Her electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia.
Her chest x-ray revealed no effusion, no pneumonia, and no pneumothorax.
Her ultrasound of her left thigh revealed a small fluid collection in the left lateral thigh.
They recommended ultrasound-guided tap aspirate of the left thigh fluid collection, which on Gram stain showed 4+ polymorhoneucleocytes.
An MRI of her left thigh was obtained on [**2144-4-20**].
Her blood culture on this date was found to have staphylococcus bacteremia.
She underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram, which did not show any vegetations.
The patient's hypotension was improved and was able to be weaned off dopamine on [**2144-4-21**].
They recommended tapping of the patient's abdominal fluid collection, which was found on the MRI study of her left thigh and abdomen.
On [**2144-4-22**], the patient was no longer requiring pressor support, and her creatinine had decreased to 2.0.
The patient's final cultures came back as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus in her blood obtained on [**2144-4-19**].
By this time, the patient's white blood cell count had decreased to 19.4.
Her serum creatinine had decreased to 1.9.
As the patient has had stable blood pressure up until now, and has had peripheral edema due to saline resuscitation, the patient received a low-dose diuretic, and her urine output increased.
By this time, her serum creatinine was down at 1.4.
Her blood pressure has been stable.
With regards to the patient's methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, the patient was determined to be too high risk to receive a transesophageal echocardiogram for further evaluation of her valves.
Her baseline creatinine of 0.7 was reached on [**2144-4-26**].
Her white blood cell count was also noted to be decreasing.
The patient received a trial of 250 cc of saline bolus, and her heart rate decreased from 120 to 108.
By the next morning, the patient's tachycardia had resolved, and her heart rate ranged between 80s to 100s.
This fluid was sent for cell count and culture.
The patient also received a chest x-ray on this date for crackles noted on physical examination.
