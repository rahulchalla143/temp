She was taken to an OSH, where a head CT showed a significant amount of blood in her right ventricle.
She was loaded with 1 g of Dilantin, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Leftward shift of ventricular septum and slight increase in shift of midline structures compared to CT this am.
Cerebral angiogram [**2155-11-28**]: IMPRESSION: Diagnostic cerebral arteriogram was done which showed abnormal tangles of vessels arising from P2 segments of the right PCA which could represent arteriovenous malformation AVM.
CT Head [**2155-11-30**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI Head [**2155-12-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Cerebral Angiogram [**2155-12-5**]: Entangled vessels present at the right PCA but no clear draining vein.
On [**11-28**] a cerebral angiogram was done which showed a questionable AVM.
A repeat angiogram is to be repeated in one week time to assess with a less obstructive view secondary to blood.
She did have a repeat angiogram on [**12-5**] which showed abnormal vasculature although no definitive draining vein although most consistent with AVM.
The patient refused PT evaluation but was ambulating independently without difficulty.
You will need an angiogram at that time.
