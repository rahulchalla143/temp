Brief Hospital Course:    This 80 yo female with a h/o interstitial lung disease (?miliary pattern), MALT lymphoma, bilat breast ca s/p bilat mastectomies, cryptococcal and aspergillus pna's in [**2119**] and aspergillus in [**2123**], recent MRSA pna currently on 6wk course of linezolid (started [**12-6**]), recent sinusitis s/p 2 weeks levoflox (finished 1 wk prior to admission)), recent C. diff (finished metronidazole 5-6 days ago), who initially presented with a 2 days of diarrhea, decreased po intake, dizziness, weakness, and falls.
It was thought that her delta MS may have been due to underlying infection, and source for this was sought out.
Pulmonary, ID, and thoracics were consulted to evaluate her chronic lung process that appeared unchanged on CT from this admission (pt still with RLL consolidation with cavitary component, unchanged from prior study despite 4 weeks of linezolid).
Cultures have remained negative, and pt has had only low-grade fevers.
Interdisciplinary family meeting on [**1-10**] was held, and it was decided to proceed with CT-guided core biopsy when possible to biopsy lung process and lymph nodes.
She was transferred to the MICU on [**2124-1-10**], she became tachypneic on the floor approximately 1 hour s/p PRBC transfusion, with RR to 40's, with ABG of 7.17/76/217 (?baseline CO2).
She received 20 mg IV lasix with only a small amount of concentrated  urine output .
Her hypercarbic respiratory failure seemed to correlate temporarily with blood transfusion (1hr s/p).
Her initial ABG was consistent with hypercarbia; this improved with non-invasive ventilation and O2 sats have been stable.
Hypovolemia is most likely etiology    - bolus as necessary for bp; follow UO, goal even to 500 cc positive    - will reck TTE in am; EKG without ischemic signs, no reason to suspect cardiogenic shock .
CHF: signs of dCHF on TTE from [**11-27**]; BNP elevated but seems intravascularly depleted, BP responed to IVF      - follow I/Os and lung exam .
Anemia: - S/p PRBC yesterday - Getting pan CT to look for bleeding site, concern for RP bleed vs. head bleed - 1 unit PRBC today.

#Weakness/dizziness/falls -- Pt's neuro exam is non-focal, making CVA seem unlikely.
Send off sputum, blood cx, legionella urinary ag, galactomannan  With hypogammaglobulinemia, will likely need heme and id consults for question of IVIg and abx tailoring, respectively.
Pt's o2 sats stable (somewhat improved from results at rehab).
