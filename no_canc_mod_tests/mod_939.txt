The patient underwent a cardiac MRI and ICD placement on [**2200-3-31**].
# Bacteremia: Blood culture from OSH was positive for Streptococcus aglacticae which was sensitive to Ampicillin and ceftriaxone.
ID was consulted and felt that there was no contraindication to ICD placement given that blood cultures had been negative for several days.
An MRI of the spine revealed the possibiliy of discitis, and ID recommended a 6 week course of ceftriaxone, to complete on [**2200-5-1**] (2g q12 until [**4-2**], then 1g q24 until [**5-1**]).
HIV negative, TSH was within normal limits.
His hematocrit remained stable and there was no suggestion of acute blood loss.
[**Doctor First Name **] and HBV, HCV serologies were negative.
Hb A1c was 5.6% suggesting this was most likely secondary to his acute illness .
These need to be followed as an outpatient, and if he continues to develop new lesions, further work-up may be indicated.
-LFTs, CBC with diff, Chem-7 and ESR and fax to [**Hospital **] clinic noted on page 1.
-Renal cyst noted on cardiac MRI, further work-up may be indicated -Monitor buttock ulcerations for improvement, consider work-up if more lesions develop  Medications on Admission: Home medications: - Lisinopril 5mg QD PO - Carvedilol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **] PO - Simvastatin 20mg QD PO  Discharge Medications: 1. lisinopril 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Several different studies were done on your heart here at the hospital, and it was decided that a pacemaker with a defibrilator should be placed to help keep your heart beating at a normal rate and rhythm.
