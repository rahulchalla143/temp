There, she ruled in for acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure and NSTEMI, with peak troponin of 5.3.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], underwent cardiac cath revealing 2v disease (OM2 95%, RCA 100% likely chronic).

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-3-10**], a CoreValve prosthesis is present.
The right ventricle was probably mildly hypokinetic/dilated on the prior study also.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
No malignant arrhythmias noted on telemetry thus far, and her baseline ECG is unchanged from her pre-op LBBB.
Titrated her Coreg as tolerated by her BP and HR.
Pacing wires and CT were discontinued without incident.
Target INR 2.0-2.5.
