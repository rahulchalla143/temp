Admission Date:  [**2153-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-4-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-4-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**] Chief Complaint: Wegeners granulomatosis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CT guided biopsy Chest tube placement and removal Kidney biopsy   History of Present Illness: 34 y/o M with PMHx of DM I who was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 89453**] for work-up of anemia of unclear etiology.
He was found to have a hematocrit of 18.9 at his PCP's office.
He received two units of PRBCs and Hct at discharge was 24.6.
Bone marrow biopsy showed bone marrow suppression and iron deficiency.
He had a bronchoscopy with BAL which was negative for pathogens (some still pending) or eosinophilic predominance.
He had an MRI of the chest which showed Round heterogeneous lesion in the anterior mediastinum measuring 5.4 x 3.9 x 4.7 cm without appreciable loss of signal intensity on out-of-phase imaging with mild enhancement.
Diagnostic considerations include thymoma versus lymphoma.
Incidentally during his work up, P-ANCA was preliminarily positive and thought to be paraneoplastic, but they were awaiting confirmatory results from [**Hospital1 2025**].
On [**2153-4-10**] the attg was notified from the [**Hospital1 2025**] lab that the patient was strongly positive for PR3-ANCA - which has prompted the current admission.
Patient had labs drawn yesterday and notably his Hct was 20.1, wbc: 12.0 On the floor, patient denies complaints.

Mesangial IgA (minimal), kappa light chain (trace), lambda light chain (minimal), and C1q (minimal) are seen.
Electron microscopy studies will be sent as an addendum.
PAS and silver  methenamine stains were done to evaluate basement membranes.
Masson trichrome preparations were done to study fibrotic changes.
Note: Please also refer to flow cytometry report  Imaging: [**2153-4-16**] CXR: Comparison chest radiographs dating between [**2153-4-4**] to [**2153-4-15**].
Subtle ground-glass opacities are present and shown to better detail on recent CT scan.
He was found to have a high titer positive for C-ANCA after extensive workup of iron deficiency anemia on prior hospitalization.
A CT guided biopsy of the mass was performed on [**2153-4-13**] which revealed it was cystic in nature, not consistent with lymphoma.
Hepatitis serologies were negative and a PPD was negative on [**4-9**].
After renal biopsy confirmed acute changes consistent with Wegner's in the kidney, the rheumatology and renal consult teams conferred and decided to treat him with rituxan (instead of cytoxan) due to rituxan's more favorable side effect profile.
# Hyperglycemia/Type I diabetes:  The patient had worsening control of blood sugars with high dose steroids.
His blood sugars decreased on increased lantus dosing (now at 35 qam and 30 qpm) and an increased humalog sliding scale.
Their recommendation is to repeat an MRI of his chest in 3 months.
His Hct dropped as low as 21, but then rose on its own and was 23 by discharge.
He should have a Hct check during follow up to ensure his anemia continues to improve.
Exam was significant for hyperresonance.
CXR revealed large hemopneumothorax with mild tension.
The pneumothorax resolved within 24 hours and the chest tube was removed.
Follow up CXR on [**4-16**] showed continued resolution.
Transition of care: - Patient needs repeat chest MRI in 3 months (early [**2153-7-13**]) for follow up of the mediastinal mass.
- Patient will need continued titration of insulin dosing as his steroid dose changes.
You had a biopsy of the mass in your chest which was found to be a cyst.
You will need a repeat chest imaging in 3 months to check for any change in the mass/cyst.
