HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 79-year-old woman, with known AS x 9 years followed by serial echoes, the last echo with worsening aortic stenosis and a diminishing aortic valve area, referred for cath and followed by aortic valve replacement.
The patient had an echo done in [**2100-8-29**] that showed an EF of 60 percent with an aortic valve area of 0.9, and a peak gradient of 96, and a mean gradient of 60, with mild LVH, 1 plus AI, and 1 plus TR.
She had a cardiac cath done [**10-5**] that showed an aortic valve gradient of 56, with an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm2, an EF of 56 percent, RCA 40 percent, left main 20 percent, and an LAD 30 percent lesion.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate 86, blood pressure 124/80, respiratory rate 20, height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 138 pounds.
Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis 1 plus bilaterally.
Carotid ultrasound showed less than 40 percent stenosis bilaterally.
LABS:  White count 4.5, hematocrit 32, platelets 234, PT 12.8, INR 1.0, sodium 139, potassium 3.2, chloride 100, CO2 28, BUN 16, creatinine 0.8, glucose 122, ALT 13, AST 22, alk phos 82, amylase 78, total bili 0.5, albumin 4.0, hemoglobin A1C 5.1.
Chest x-ray showed no CHF or pneumonia.
Her bypass time was 142 minutes with a crossclamp time of 102 minutes.
At the time of transfer, the patient was in a normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats per minute, with a mean arterial pressure of 67 and a CVP of 15.
However, she did require a Nipride drip to maintain a blood pressure between 100 and 110.
Additionally, her chest tubes were removed, and she was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
DISCHARGE VITALS:  Temperature 98.3, heart rate 81--sinus rhythm, blood pressure 128/66, respiratory rate 22, O2 sat 94 percent on room,  weight preoperatively 63 kg, at discharge 60.1 kg.
LAB DATA:  Hematocrit 29.4, sodium 142, potassium 3.5, chloride 102, CO2 34, BUN 16, creatinine 0.8, glucose 98.
