Throughout hospitalizaion patient was also followed by renal transplant team, who initially felt that her renal impairment was reversible, however after 3 weeks of HD, patient was listed for dual (liver and kidney) for transplantation.
MELD calculated on admission labs as 30, peaked at > 40 and on [**2186-1-29**] was 38.
underwent RUQ u/s showing 9mm and 5mm lesions consistent w HCC, portal hypertension, patent main portal vein with forward flow.
She underwent an EGD and had grade III varices banded on [**12-23**].
She underwent several diagnostic and therapeutic paracenteses including 7L on [**1-28**], 3L on [**2-2**], [**1-11**] 5L, therapeutic on [**12-29**] 3L, dx/tx 4L on [**12-24**].
Cx were always negative and ascitic fluid was always high in RBC content: 176K to 1.6M.
Patient had a likely HCC seen on CT but still within transplant guidelines.
Hypotensive episodes were deemed to be due to simultaneous HD sessions and Large volume parecenteses as well as on one occasion GIB requiring temporary MICU admission for monitoring (SBPs < 84mmHg).
Patient continued to have abdominal distension on exam which improved significantly w/ therapeutic paracenteses.
Subsequent chest xrays showed persistent lower lobe atelectasis.
Over the next few days her urine output was noted to drop significantly to around 100 cc daily.
Renal ultrasound showed an increased RI in the renal artery, no evidence of hydronephrosis.
On [**3-20**] (POD 7) she had a transplant kidney biopsy with results showing an acute humoral rejection.
She underwent a total of 10 sessions of plasmapheresis ([**3-20**] - [**4-3**]).
A repeat biopsy was performed on [**3-27**] which was continuing to show some evidence of humoral rejection.
At this time the urine output was noted to increase daily and she was having outputs of greater then one liter and by [**4-5**] her urine output was  greater than 2 liters daily.
Her creatinine stabilized around 1.3 In the post op period, despite the fact that the liver synthetic function was improving daily, she was still having a large volume of ascites that required paracentesis.
The last paracentesis was done on [**2186-4-3**].
She underwent an EGD on [**3-29**] which showed diffuse circumferential ulceration with focal hemorrhagic areas in the upper and mid esophagus, a large adherent clot was noted in the mid esophagus and some oozing noted from the base of the clot.
She had also been given a short holiday on the antivirals as her white count briefly dipped as low as 1.5, but rebounded once the drug conversions were made.
She has returned to fluconazole and the micafungin stopped after 14 days therapy.
Cultures were sent showing that the triple lumen catheter was positive for staph coag negative.
The dialysis catheter did not show any growth, but the blood cultures obtained at that same time were also positive for Staph coag nagative and she was started on Vancomycin which will be complete on [**2186-4-16**].
She experienced much pain from the esophageal issues as seen on EGD and also significant abdominal pain when ascites fluid volumes were high requiring paracentesis.
