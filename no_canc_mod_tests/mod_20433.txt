[**2145-5-4**] CT head: 1.
[**2145-5-4**] CT TORSO: 1.
Lower SVC is still probably slightly narrowed as seen on the recent angiography study of [**2145-4-1**].
The right-sided pleural effusion has increased in size since previous study and the left-sided pleural effusion has decreased in size.
Further evaluation with ultrasound can be performed for further evaluation.
[**2145-5-4**] Unilateral LE U/S:Extremely limited exam due to diffuse edema and body habitus.
This structure is in the same vicinity as echodense structures seen in the prior study of [**2145-4-2**] but fewer views were obtained so comparison is limited.
Echo with bubble did show evidence of pulmonary shunting.
MRI of the brain, however, was without evidence of stroke or bleed.
Serum and urine toxicology screens were negative.
She underwent CT Torso which showed no evidence of new clot.
No evidence of infection based on culture data.
# RA/SVC thrombus vs. vegetation: Patient with known mass that was evaluated on prior admission by CT surgery.
CT surgery team from prior admission was e-mailed and stated that in the setting of no known embolization (stroke/PE) they would not recommend surgical intervention at this time.
Remained on heparin drip until INR therapeutic.
Patient should have her INR checked at next dialysis session and rehab should follow up on INR.
Imaging of your brain showed no acute bleed and your symptoms resolved.
