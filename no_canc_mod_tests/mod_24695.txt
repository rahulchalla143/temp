At that time, his blood pressure was measured and found to be low at 90/50, with a heart rate in 40's-50's, and unmeasurable temperature.
He was taken to [**Hospital6 2910**], where meansured rectal temperature was 89, and remainder of vital signs were: HR 52, BP 132/80, 100%sat.

ECHO - [**2142-5-24**]: GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to cooperate.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 65%).
Final internal length is 38 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC.
CT abdomen/pelvis w/ contrast [**5-14**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**5-15**]: HISTORY: Altered mental status with hypothermia and fluid resuscitation.
Discharge Labs: Na 141 / K 4.1 / Cl 103 / HCO3 29 / BUN 20 / Cr 1.5 / 85 Ca 8.6 / Mg 1.9 / P 3.2 CBC 7.2 / Hgb 9.9 / Hct 31.3 / Plts 257 / MCV 94  Brief Hospital Course: #) Hypothermia.
The differential for hypothermia includes hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, hypoglycemia, sepsis, vasodilation/impaired regulation from medication, or environmental among other causes.
An EEG in the MICU demonstrated only encephalopathy.
Follow-up with the patient's nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] (SNIF)on [**2142-5-16**] revealed that his temperatures run low at baseline (never more than 96F).
A toxicology screen was negative.
A TSH, cortisol and blood cultures were ordered.
Free T4/total T4 levels were check which showed both WNL.
Neurology noted that vital signs abnormalities could be [**12-19**] to autonomic dysfunction or a parkinson-plus type syndrome, but that further work-up would likely not change management and that work-up would also be difficult [**12-19**] to patient's demented state.
#) Hypotension/Hypertension: The patients blood pressure was labile upon arrival to MICU, with SBP 170->70.
The hypotension resolved and pt later became hypertensive while on the medicine floor.
Once patient was transferred to the floor, his heart rate drifted down to the 30-50 range where it stayed for the next week without any symptoms.
One set of cardiac enzymes were negative and pt was placed on ASA and ACS dose of a statin for precautionary reasons.
Pt continued to be brady in the 30-50s for the rest of admission with his EKG showing sinus rhythm with a prolong PR interval.
#) Coag Negative Staph bacteremia: After abx were stopped in the ICU, Blood Cx from [**5-15**] ultimately came back with 1/4 bottles positive for CONS.
ID was asked what to do about this finding and recommended putting back on Vanco until initial cultures at [**Hospital6 2910**] and F/U culture form [**5-18**] at [**Hospital1 18**] came back negative.
A xray of the R thigh found that pt indeed had hardware in the form of a metal screw in an old fracture in his R femur.
An TTE ECHO of the heart was done that was a very poor quality study because patient was moving.
Although ID was suspicious that these cultures were both contaminants, they recommended antibiotics (either Vanco or Linezolid) be continued to finish a 14 day course from the 7/2 blood culture (finishing day [**5-31**]).
Multiple blood cultures are still pending from [**Date range (1) 85724**]/[**2141**] (see pertinent results).
A serum and urine toxicology screen were negative.
Blood was only drawn intermittently because phlebotomy was often unable to access a vein.
#) Bright red blood per rectum: Initially there was some concern that patient was haivng rectal bleeding as there was note documentation of BRBPR and a Hct drop after admission.
Initial Hct drop was attributed to the ressucitiation fluids the patient was given at ICU presentation.
His Hct stayed stable the rest of the admission and on evidence of rectal bleeding was ever observed.
Free T4, Total T4, and TSH were all found to be WNL during admission.
It was initially increased to a ACS dose during one evening where there was concern over EKG changes.
However, enzymes and clinical situation did not indicate any ACS type event so patient was returned to home Zocor dose at discharge.
Medications on Admission: -Artificial Tears -Aricept 10mg qday -Colace 100mg [**Hospital1 **] -Prednisone 5mg qday -Trazadone 50mg q6h -Iron 325mg [**Hospital1 **] -Synthroid 50 mcg qday -Zocor 20mg qday -Lasix 20mg PO qday  Discharge Medications:  1.
Vancomycin in 0.9% Sodium Cl 1 gram/250 mL Solution Sig: One (1)  Intravenous twice a day for 7 days.
A study of your brain waves were ordered showing encephalopathy.
Your blood pressure was maintained with IV fluids and as you improved we were able to give you food which you tolerated.
Although they were briefly stopped, we re-started you on antibiotics because two different blood cultures grew a bacteria called coag negative staph.
An ultra-sound of your heart showed no evidence of endocartitis.
Your urine function was found to be slightly abnormal with a creatinine of 1.5 at discharge.
Will need to check Vancomycin trough before 4th dose (AM dose on [**5-27**]).
