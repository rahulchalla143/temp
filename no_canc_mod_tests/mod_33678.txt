Chest tube was removed and CXR post removal resulted in a left sided small apical pneumothorax which was stable on multiple subsequent chest radiographs.
The patient was discharged to home after review of these radiographs by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] with the understanding that Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**] should return  in three days to repeat a chest radiograph.
