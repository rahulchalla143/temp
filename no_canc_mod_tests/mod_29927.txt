In the ED, initial vitals were: afebrile 139/63 56 19 94% on 2L.
His rectal exam showed red blood, but no frank hemorrhage.
Labs revealed HCT 20 from baseline 29.
His EKG was significant for new ST depressions in V2-V6.
An NG lavage was performed which was negative.
A sinus ryhthm of 20 was noted, and the patient received 1 round of epinephrine and atropine and regained both pulse and blood pressure.
His cardiac arrest was thought to be likly due to demand ischemia from GI bleed which triggered myocardial infarction and potentially cardiac arrest.
His GI bleed ceased and Hct stabilized at 31.4 post total 5 units of tranfusion and fluid resuscitation.
Echo was done to evaluate LVEF and showed EF of 35%-->20%.
Patient was extubated on [**2124-9-13**] and pt tolerated well at O2 sat greater than 95%.

Echo [**2124-9-11**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with global hypokinesis and inferior, septal and apical akinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
ECG [**2124-9-14**] Sinus bradycardia.
His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most likely due to demand from GI bleeding.
It was recommended to have repeated Echo to re-eval LVEF as out patient per his Cardiologist.
His Hct was stable at 37.3 on discharge.
It is important to closly monitor his Hct given h/o acute blood loss and resulted in cardiac arrest.
# GI bleed: Gi followed patient and decided not to perform endoscopy/colonoscopy due to recent cardiac arrest and per patient/family request.
Coumadin started on [**2124-9-18**] and HCT was checked Q4D while on IV heparin.
Hct was stable on d/c at 37.3.
It is important that his HCT closly monitored for potential recurrent blood loss.
and IV Heparin need to be transitioned off once INR is therapeutic.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35%-->20% post Cardiac arrest.
# Acute on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) 216**].
His Cr stablized to his baseline 3.2->3.7->2.6 with volume resuscitation.
# h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP in setting of GI bleed.
Pt was stable on Heparin then Coumadin 2.5mg daily was added on [**9-18**] with close Hct monitoring.
His Hct was 37.3 on discharge.
Pt will need to be transitioned off Heparin once INR is therapeutic (goal 2.0-2.5).
pain controlled and no acute issue noted .
# Code - Full code confirmed with family, but if pt deteriorates would not want life to be prolonged by life support .

Your Hematocrit was at 20.1 on admission and red blood was noted in your rectum and you were transfused with blood.
Once your condition was stable (no evidence of bleeding) you were again restarted on heparin and coumadin, your blood levels remained stable and there was no evidence of bleeding.
[**Hospital1 4692**], in accordance with you and your wife's wishes, we did not do an endoscopy or colonoscopy to investigate the initial source of your bleeding.
You will need to carefully monitor your INR and your blood level (hematocrit) with your primary care doctor for signs of bleeding.
