CT brain [**4-23**] - 1.
[**4-24**] Renal U/S - Bilateral renal calcifications.
[**4-26**] CT brain - 1.
[**2194-4-28**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Included lung bases are clear and there is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
Limited evaluation of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, stomach, and bowel appear unremarkable.

[**5-3**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Status post removal of the ventricular drain without change in ventricular size or brain compared with the prior CT from [**2194-5-1**].
Post-operatively his exam showed localizing on the right and left plegic.
[**4-22**] Records were obtained from a previous admission [**1-6**] to [**Hospital **] hospital that indicated a previous hospitalization for hypertensive emergency resulting in a  right [**Doctor First Name **] Ganglia hemorrhage.
EVD was raised to 15 after review of CT that shows the left lateral ventricl to be collapsed.
Overnight, he remained febrile and on [**4-24**] CSF cultures were sent and were essentially negative for growth.
Sputum Culture was positive for multiple organisms and as a result pt was started on vanc/cef.
He became febrile on [**4-28**] and CSF was sent which showed some PMNs.
Additionally, his EVD was increased to 20 cm H20 and his ICPs continued to remain stable.
His serum NA was 150 and he was given free water with good effect.
His serum NA was stable.
A head CT was done whcih showed no evidence of ventricular enlargement after clamping of his EVD.
he remained stable voernight and on [**5-3**] he had a temperature of 101 and urine was sent for testing.
On [**5-5**] screening LENI's were negative and free water was again increased per renal.
On [**5-6**] repeat 24hr urine revealed increased Na so his free water was increased.
