CT scan of the chest showed large left pleural effusion and a moderate to large right pleural effusion w/o lymphadenopathy.
She underwent a thoracentesis which showed a pH 7.4, LDH 248, c/w exudative effusion, with gram stain negative and NGTD on culture and pending cytology.
A TTE showed a moderate sized paricardial effusion with no signs of tamponade.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she underwent repeat transthoracic echo on [**5-8**] which revealed preserved EF of 55% but also showed a pericardial effusion with sustained RA collapse and right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with cardiac tamponade.
She reports decreased energy since her pelvic fracture in [**2198-2-25**], for which she was at rehab prior to MWH presentation.
She reports increased thirst and some increased "thickness" of her legs since her pelvic fracture.

TTE [**2198-5-9**] Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed from post tap) of [**2198-5-8**], no change.
Cardiac Cath [**2198-5-8**] 1.
Repeat 2D echocardiogram in AM.
============ Radiology ============ Chest X ray [**5-10**]  Bilateral pleural effusions have not significantly changed in the interim and the slightly better aeration of the right lung base may be due to redistribution of the fluid.
Chest X ray [**5-9**] Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left.
# Pericardial effusion with tamponade - Had pericardiocentesis and drain placement [**5-8**] with subsequent removal the following day.
Etiology thought to be likely malignant given history of BrCA and coincident pleural effusions with CT chest showing suspicion of lymphangitic spread of CA, but cytology was negative.
Repeat TTE showed no signs of tamponade.
Pleural effusions - these were most suspicious for malignancy given that OSH CT scan also with interstial process of the left lung.
CXR over 2 days showed stability.
Patient was maintained on oxygen while in house to keep peripheral saturations greater than 90. .

The fluid was drained off and a repeat ECHO does not show reaccumulation of the fluid.
The culture and cytology tests are pending on that fluid.
You will need another ECHO in 3 weeks to check to see if the fluid reaccumulates.
an ultrasound should be repeated at that time as well if appropriate.
