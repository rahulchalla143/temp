Echo revealed decline in EF to 10% (from 30% in [**2099**]) and AS with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2.
He has a h/o 2vessel CAD on cath in [**2099**].
Cardiac cath will be performed on Monday, [**2107-1-31**].
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 10 - 15 %).
The patient was started on NTG and his PA pressures came down from 70/35 to 55/30 with modest improvement of RV fxn.
Based on the epi-aortic scan and the surgeon's assessment of the ascending aorta, the procedure was changed to an off-pump LIMA - LAD CABG only.
LV systolic fxn is severly depressed.

Cardiac catheterization  demonstrated 3-vessel coronary artery disease with 60% left anterior descending artery stenosis, 70-95% left circumflex artery stenosis, an occluded right coronary artery with poor left-to-right collaterals.
He went into rapid atrial fibrillation on POD#1 and dropped his systolic blood pressure into the 70's.
He did have post operative acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 2.0 and this was decreasing at the time of discharge.
He was started on Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and received 2 doses of 5 mg and INR went to 4.8.
He was resumed with Coumadin at a lower dose and INR was therapurtic at the time of discharge.
