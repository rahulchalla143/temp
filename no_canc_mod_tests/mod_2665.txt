Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with three vessel disease.
The LCx showed a 90% proximal instent restenosis with diffuse stenoses of the OM1 and OM2 branches at 60-70%.
The RCA showed 40% instent restenosis with 30-50% stenoses in the mid- and distal segments, with a discrete 70% stenosis of a large posterolateral branch.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated pulmonary artery pressures of 82/30, with moderately elevated mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 21mmHg and mean right atrial pressure of 17mmHg.
The gradient between diastolic pulmonary pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is suggestive of increased pulmonary vascular resistance.
The cardiac output was severely depressed at 1.7 L/min/m2.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection, and 0% residual stenosis.
Echo ([**2167-7-10**]): LVEF 40% 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2166-12-24**], there is no significant change.
CXR ([**2167-7-9**] and [**2167-7-10**]): Low lung volumes with no evidence of overt congestive heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo M with CAD, DM, CHF with EF 40-45% who presents with chest pain s/p cardiac cath, with pulm HTN.
* ischemia: significant h/o CAD as above, lipid panel in [**1-26**] showed TC 129, HDL 49, LDL 64, TG 79.  max trop at 1.10.
Echo showed no significant change from prior.
* pump: has history of CHF, with EF 40-45%.
PVR 680 (nl <200).
Digoxin was d/c'd as it was not clear why this medication was started given that he has not been overly symptomatic with heart failure symptoms.
As above, echo showed no significant changes from prior.
He will followup to have his labs drawn in the next few days given the increase in lasix dose and Hct will be rechecked as well.
Outpatient Lab Work Please have creatinine, potassium, magnesium, sodium, bicarbonate, BUN, chloride, and hematocrit checked by [**2167-7-14**].
We made the following changes to your regimen: - We stopped your Digoxin (you can discuss this with your cardiologist) - We increased your lasix to 40 mg; you will need to have your kidney function and electrolytes checked to ensure they are stable on this new regimen - If you are experiencing lightheadedness of dizziness, talk to your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15137**] your dose of Toprol.
You should get your electrolytes, kidney function, and hematocrit checked within 4-5 days of discharge to ensure that you are tolerating your medication regimen.
