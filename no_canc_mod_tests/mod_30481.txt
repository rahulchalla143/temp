At the NH, she was hypotensive with a BP of 60/40, which improved to 80/60 with 500ml NS.
In the ED, code stroke called but head CT showed no bleed.
Urine cultures from day of admission, however, revealed pseudomonas was resistant to meropenem.
Additionally, cultures from a recent bronchial washing revealed MRSA and, given pneumonia on imaging and clinically with associated sepsis, she has been continued on vancomycin since admission.
6)Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease- PFT [**7-2**]- FVC 61% pred,  FEV1 56% pred, FEV1/FVC 92%, Reduced FVC related to gas trapping, ~400 cc worse than PFT from one year ago.

If the patient has strict contraindications to iodinated contrast, MRI of the chest should be considered to answer the clinical question of hilar mass.
If the patient undergoes a contrast enhanced CT of the chest or MRI, inclusion of the abdomen may be considered to more completely evaluate these structures if warranted clinically.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-8-22**], right ventricle is now smaller and more vigorous.
Sensitivity data demonstrated pan-resistant pseudomonas in the urine, however, in discussion with infectious disease, in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] sensitivities may not appropriately reflect in [**Last Name (un) **] sensitivities and meropenem is concentrated in the urine so may indeed adequately treat her pseudomonal infection.
Her blood pressures stabilized and did not require pressors, she was in addition maintained on Vancomycin renally dosed, as she recently had the history of MRSA pneumonia in [**2169-9-15**].
She did transiently have increased oxygen requirement with oxygen saturations in the mid 80s on room air which required 4L O2 by NC to maintain O2 sats in the mid 90s.
She was given an additional dose of IV lasix to which she responded well and again is maintaining oxygen saturations in the mid 90s on room air.
Her creatinine was 2.3 on admission which improved with treatment of her infections and active diuresis and was 1.4 on discharge.
# Anemia: Baseline Hct 30.
Recent iron studies [**8-/2169**] reveal normal iron, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin, thus appear consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Her hematocrit remained stable during her admission.
Her hematocrit remained stable and she should be followed up in gastroenterology clinic.
Head CT on admission was negative for acute bleed.
Neuro exam is back to her baseline without new focal deficits and her right sided facial findings are also at baseline upon discharge.
# Pulmonary Mass: Appears on CXR and Right hilar mass was also seen on chest CT. She will need future follow-up imaging to monitor for change.

To clarify what this is, you need to have a CT scan with contrast once you are more stable.
