She was reporting some mild dyspnea, and a horase voice, but denied dysuria, chest pain, palpitations, and syncope.
In the ER, patient was found to have oxygen saturation of 68% at triage and was brought back to the ED core.
EKG was reportedly at baseline.
On transfer, VS were 113/47, 48, 100% on Bipap 12/5 with an FiO2 100%.

Followup chest radiograph after appropriate therapy is indicated to exclude underlying pulmonary mass.
CT Head ([**2126-6-2**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Echo ([**2126-6-3**]) - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-2-23**], left ventricular systolic function has improved and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.
Portable CXR [**2126-6-7**]: Compared with earlier the same day, there ay be mild increase in the degree of vascular plethora.
ECG [**2126-6-7**]: Atrial fibrillation.
Since the previous tracing of [**2126-6-2**] axis appears further leftward and delayed R wave progression is more prominent.
Pneumonia: Patient with R infiltrate on CXR with relative leukocytosis and recent AMS which may secondary to infection/PNA.
Was kept at goal oxygen saturation of 88-92% in setting of chronic CO2 retaining.
She remained at goal with 1-2L oxygen via nasal cannula until night of [**2126-6-7**] when she was found to be tachypneic with RR 50s.
Labs revealed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis with HCO3 41; ABG pH 7.41, pO2 54, pCO2 65.
Given elevated INR, head CT was done which was negative for acute bleed.
ACS seemed less likely as EKG was at baseline, but troponin was mildly elevated in the setting of renal dysfunction.
All antibiotics, anticoagulation, labs, and vitals were stopped at that time.
On admission, INR was elevated to 12, may be secondary to poor nutrtion or medicine malcompliance.
Received 10mg IV vitamin K in the ED and subsequently INR decreased to 2.2 which was subtherapeutic for her AVR and MVR.
Cr 1.8 on admission, likely secondary to prerenal etiology given dry appearance.
UA was positive with 6-10 WBC, many bacteria, and trace leuks (although it did have epithelials).
Urine culture grew 10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML of group B strep.
Lasix was initially held during hospital course because she appeared dry on exam and had history of minimal po intake.
BNP 25,000 but there were no priors for comparison.
EKG unchanged from prior.
Repeat TTE showed moderate TR and moderate pulmonary HTN improved from prior.
On [**2126-6-7**], telemetry showed several runs of V-tach (the longest run being 18 beats) but HR remained in the 80s and no intervention was pursued at the time.
