The laparoscopy showed a left corpus luteal cyst, right posterior pelvic endometriosis, no ectopic pregnancy, and a normal appendix.
Diagnostic laparoscopy, as above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission, the patient had a temperature of 98.6, pulse 100, respiratory rate 20 and blood pressure 122/88 with an oxygen saturation of 100% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Extraocular movements intact, right pupil 7 mm contracting down to 3 mm to light, left pupil contracting down to 2 mm, no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurologic:  Tenderness to palpation in lower lumbosacral region, deep tendon reflexes 2+ in bilateral upper and bilateral lower extremities, sensation to light touch symmetric, motor strength symmetric ([**5-12**]).
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 6.6 with an unremarkable differential, hemoglobin 12.1, hematocrit 35.8, platelet count 229,000, sodium 106, potassium 4.2, chloride 76, bicarbonate 24, BUN 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose 109, calcium 8, magnesium 1.3 and phosphorous 2.7.
Beta hCG was 1,409 which was increased from 658 on [**2187-11-14**].
Urinalysis was negative.
Serum osmolarity was 228 and urine osmolarity was 501.
Urine sodium was 107 and urine chloride was 87.
The patient's sodium was initially checked every four hours.
Her TSH and cortisol levels were checked and found to be within normal limits.
In the first two days of her hospitalization, the patient's sodium rose slowly from a nadir of 106 to a level of 120 on hospital day number two.
The patient's sodium then reached a plateau and began to decrease again, back down to 124.
The patient's sodium then began to increase again and, on the day of discharge, her sodium was 133.
A sample sent for a PBG spot test returned presumptively positive and a hematology/oncology consult was obtained.
Serial 24 hour urine collections were obtained and sent for ALA and PBG.
At the time of discharge, the results from these definitive biochemistry tests are still pending from Crest Diagnostics.
Given these new complaints, a neurologic examination revealed decreased deep tendon reflexes bilaterally and Hematin was ordered from [**Company 36178**] in [**Location (un) **], [**State 18250**] as a precaution in case her porphyria acutely worsened.
Her beta hCG appeared to rise appropriately for the first four days after her diagnostic laparoscopy, however, subsequent beta hCG levels failed to demonstrate the appropriate doubling despite the presence of an intrauterine gestational sac.
The patient underwent an uncomplicated dilatation and evacuation on hospital day number eight.
The patient's hematocrit on admission was 35.8, however, on hospital day number two, her hematocrit was found to be 28.5%.
Multiple abdominal, pelvic, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasounds revealed only a small (less than 4 cm) infraumbilical hematoma at the umbilical port site.
To better evaluate for a possible intra-abdominal bleed, the patient underwent an abdominal pelvic magnetic resonance imaging scan which again revealed only a small subcutaneous hematoma that had been previously described by ultrasound, and no intra-abdominal fluid collection.
The patient's blood pressure and heart rate remained stable at a hematocrit of about 24.
Because the patient was asymptomatic with this heart rate and because of the concern that her porphyria was progressing, the decision was made to hold off administering blood products which may potentially further stress her system for the time being.
On hospital day number ten (postoperative day number three status post dilatation and evacuation), the patient underwent a blood transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells.
The patient tolerated the blood transfusion well and a post transfusion hematocrit showed the appropriate rise.
On the day of discharge, the patient's hematocrit was 30.3 and the patient was asymptomatic.
