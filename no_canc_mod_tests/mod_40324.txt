On presentation, her blood pressure was 253/135.
On prior occasions, head imaging showed no pathology.
The relation between her blood pressure crisis and confusion had been appreciated in the past.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals:  Pulse 90, blood pressure 253/135, respirations 20, and 99 percent on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, with a well-healed midline incision, with no hernia.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count is 6, hematocrit 37.1, and platelets 145.
Electrolytes:  sodium 131, potassium is 4.6, chloride 104, bicarbonate 17, BUN is 42, creatinine is 4.2 and glucose 106, lactate is 1.5.
ALT is 15, AST is 37, alkaline phosphatase is 67, total bilirubin is 0.2.
Urine tox screen is negative.
IMAGING DATA:  Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate.
CT of the head showed no infarct, no bleed.
EKG was unchanged from prior.
The plan is to admit the patient to the ICU for IV, blood pressure management, Neurology consult, frequent neurologic checks, Transplant Nephrology consult regarding her recently rising creatinine and to continue immunosuppression.
Neurology saw the patient, and during her ICU course, she also had an MRI of her head, which was negative.
Her blood pressure was initially controlled on labetalol drip, which she responded nicely to, and her PO regimen was increased and she was able to be weaned off her Lopressor drip.
She had a recent biopsy, as her creatinine has been rising steadily in the last couple of months, and this showed apparently no evidence of rejection.
A concern for possible renal artery stenosis was ruled out with an MRI/MRA of her abdomen which showed widely patent transplant renal artery.
She has been making good urine, over 2 liters a day, and her immunosuppressions have been continued.
