They gave her adenosine which broke her out of SVT and back into sinus rhythm with left bundle, HR 80.
Echocardiogram performed at OSH in [**2127**] revealed EF of 40-45%.
Following conversion of her tachyarrhythmia, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation by electrophysiology.
Family History: Mother with CAD s/p CABG Father with CAD s/p CABG and "valve replacement"  Physical Exam: 97.8F HR 90 BP 128/79 RR 18 96%RA Gen: awake, alert, pleasant, sitting up in bed, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, MMM Neck: supple, no JVD CV: Distant HS, normal S1, S2 without mrg, RRR Pulm: CTAB, no w/r/r Abd: Normoactive BS, soft, ND/NT Ext: WWP, no edema   Pertinent Results: [**12-3**] CXR: Symmetric interlobular septal thickening in bilateral lower lobes.
The findings were not suggestive of cardiac sarcoid, although this diagnosis cannot be definitely excluded.
The LMCA, LAD, LCX, and RCA had no flow-limting lesions.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a normal PCPW of 8mmHg.
Cardiac index was normal at 2.6l/min/m2.
Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with a calculated ejection fraction of 23%.
A cardiac MRI was obtained to further evaluate for evidence of cardiac sarcoid, which revealed severe LV hypokinesis (EF 28%); however, was not consistent with cardiac sarcoid.
Cardiac catheterization was done which did not reveal evidence of coronary artery disease.
She had an electrophysiology study at which time she went into complete heart block and she was transferred to the CCU with a temp wire for further monitoring prior to device placement.
# Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction:  An echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate her known LBBB which revealed global hypokinesis with ejection fraction of [**9-30**]%.
Cardiomyopathy workup revealed normal thyroid function tests, normal iron studies, and SPEP/UPEP.
As above, she underwent cardiac MRI to further evaluate the possibility of cardiac sarcoid, which was not consistent with this diagnosis.
She also underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed normal coronary arteries.
