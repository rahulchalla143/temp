IMAGING STUDIES: [**2199-1-4**] CAROTID/CERVICAL EMBOLIZATION - Successful embolization of the right sphenopalatine artery (3rd order branch) using Vortex coils.
[**2199-1-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - The ET tube tip, the NG tube, the pacemaker leads, the cardiomegaly, and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-4-30**], the left ventricular cavity is larger and the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated PA systolic pressure have increased.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-1-7**] a mobile echodensity on the atrial pacing wire is now seen.
Since floor transfer, the patient had developed worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure with oxygen desaturations to the 80s on facemask with exam showing elevated JVP, inspiratory crackles and peripheral edema; CXR with evidence of pulmonary congestion with bilateral pleural effusions concerning for overt overload.
On admission, the etiologies we considered were congestive heart failure exacerbation (most likely) vs. pulmonary embolism vs. ARDS vs. TRALI or late-transfusion related reaction vs. reactive airway disease vs. infection or pneumonia (coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] in sputum culture from [**2199-1-4**]).
His clinical exam and imaging suggested that an acute systolic failure exacerbation was most likely and we performed aggressive diuresis.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION - The patient had a prior 2D-Echo from [**4-/2198**] showing LVEF of 20-25% with LV cavity that was moderately dilated with some severe regional LV systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior/inferolateral akinesis and basal inferoseptal akinesis with anterior and anterolateral hypokinesis elsewhere.
This admission, he presented with coagulopathy and epistaxis requiring 4 units FFP and 1 unit PRBCs (net positive 3L for LOS on CCU transfer) with clinical exam suggestive of over volume overload.
We also removed his LV pacing and a repeat 2D-Echo showed 18% improvement in his stroke volume without the pacing of the left ventricle, so this remained off.
# ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY, METABOLIC DERRANGEMENTS - The patient presented with a baseline creatinine of 0.7-0.9 with evidence of acute renal insufficiency to 1.2 trending to 1.7.
Patient also had an anion-gap metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory component (and primary respiratory alkalosis given work of breathing) with a lactate of [**6-26**], leukocytosis trending from 13 to 18 (afebrile) which was suggestive of poor forward flow and impaired perfuson of peripheral tissues in the setting of decompensated heart failure with or without an infectious source.
Upon admission, we performed aggressive diuresis and his creatinine improved to baseline.
Creatinine was 0.8 on the day of discharge, so lisinopril was increased to home dose.
; acute liver injury with moderate-severe transaminitis noted on admission with AST 6854 and ALT 4790 with hyperbilirubinemia to 5.1 and mild jaundice.
INR 5.1 to 6.0 on admission (on Coumadin).
Albumin 3.2 (from 3.7 baseline).
Hepatitis serologies (HbsAg negative, HbsAb positive, HbcAb positive, HCV-Ab negative, HAV-Ab positive) were consistent with prior hepatitis A exposure and immunity due to natural infection of hepatitis B.
We avoided hepatotoxic medications (discontinued Amiodarone) and monitored serial LFTs with overall marked improvement.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS - the patient presented without initial leukocytosis; but had coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus sputum culture, MSSA ([**1-4**]) with WBC trend from 13 to 18 (94% neutrophilia) this admission; but he remained afebrile.
Infectious work-up in the setting of acute decompensated failure was reassuring and we deferred antibiotic therapy.
His urinalysis and urine/[**Month/Year (2) **] cultures were all unrevealing.
His CXR showed some concern for consolidation, but this was conservatively monitored and not treated.
# CORONARIES - Coronary angiography last performed in [**4-/2195**] showed a right dominant system with an LMCA with modest calcification, the LAD had a hazy 80-90% stenosis in its proximal portion and was stented.
His EKG was reassuring, but AV-paced.
His cardiac biomarkers were reassuring.
# SEVERE EPISTAXIS, S/P IR-GUIDED EMBOLIZATION - The patient presented with left-sided posterior epistaxis and coagulopathy with INR of 5.2 requiring ENT consultation and Epistat packing bilaterally.
# ALCOHOL ABUSE HISTORY - He appears to have a history of chronic alcohol abuse with current moderate-social alcohol intake; monitored for withdrawal this admission, and he had no evidence of withdrawal.
Lidocaine level sent (patient transiently on Lidocaine gtt given his ventricular tachycardia) and should be followed-up by Cardiology.
Will need serial INR monitoring for goal INR [**2-22**].
Incessant ventricular tachycardia 4.
