At that time, the patient had a work-up for a liver transplant initiated and in [**2102-3-19**] he was noted to be Child's Class C with a score of 10 and found to have a large mediastinal lymphadenopathy that was concerning for lymphoma.
A biopsy of the lymphadenopathy was obtained and was found to be nonspecific.
The patient subsequently developed hypotension with a blood pressure in the 70s over 20, at which time he was started on the sepsis protocol in the Emergency Department.
His blood pressure soon stabilized and he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further care.
The patient was given antibiotic treatment for a presumed pneumonia that could not be visualized and white blood cell count improved but lower extremity pain persisted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission to the Emergency Department, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 98.2 F.; heart rate of 100; blood pressure of 86/78 that decreased to 74/34; respiratory rate of 20 and he was 97% on room air.
LABORATORY:  Pertinent labs on admission were a white blood cell count of 21.7, 14% bands.
Platelets of 187.
T-bili of 3.4, albumin of 2.1.
INR of 2.2, AST of 118, ALT of 70, alkaline phosphatase of 123.
Arterial blood gases on room air are 7.47, 26, 140, 98% saturation; potassium of 63 and a lactate of 62.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and blood pressure stabilized and after ruling out infection, white count normalized with fluids and it was felt that the patient had dehydration encephalopathy and hypotension induced by Fentanyl patch placement.
Subsequent physical examinations revealed a numbness and lack of sensation in the lateral thigh regions of the superficial femoral nerve, in the region of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.
The patient was given gentle diuresis for edema of the ankles, but room air saturations remained normal and the patient had no evidence for ascites.
The patient's creatinine was at 0.8 to 0.9 and increased to 1.9 and the patient was found to be in acute renal failure.
An MRI of the spinal cord weeks prior had revealed no nerve compression or evidence of abscess or meningeal enhancement.
Subsequent MRI of the entire spine revealed no lesions throughout.
The Neurology consultation felt that the pain was most likely due to meralgia paresthetica and diabetic neuropathy, despite the fact that the patient had a hemoglobin A1C less than six.
There was also concern that it was a perineoplastic syndrome affecting the femoral nerve bilaterally given the patient's history of lung nodules seen on past CT scan.
A repeat CT scan was done and revealed resolution of the right upper lobe lung nodule and stable lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum region.
White blood cell count was noted to increase up to 32 during admission.
This was also in the setting of the patient having acute renal failure and a creatinine of 1.9.
An abdominal CT failed to demonstrate significant ascites to suggest risk of peritonitis.
Clostridium difficile studies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge.
This was rechecked and there was no evidence for red blood cells or protein which ruled out concern for cryoglobulinemia or vasculitis involving kidneys.
The mediastinal right upper lung mass and lymphadenopathy noted on previous CT scan and the noncontributory FNA that had been done, it was interesting that the right upper lung mass had resolved in three weeks and this decreased the likelihood that it was due to malignancy.
The patient was instructed to have CT scans followed and to have additional biopsies as an outpatient to be arranged by [**Hospital6 14430**].
HIT antibody was sent and was found to be negative.
