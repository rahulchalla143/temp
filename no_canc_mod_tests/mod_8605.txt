Admission Date:  [**2104-11-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-11-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Epinephrine / Amiodarone / Ambien  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to left circumflex artery, balloon catheterization to OM branch   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 25866**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD s/p multiple PCIs most recently in [**4-21**], ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LVEF 25-30%, PAF, and CVA transferred from an OSH for cardiac catheterization after VF arrest.
His labs at that time were notable for elevated cardiac biomarkers to CK 42, MB 3.1, TnT 0.22.
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated 60% proximal and mid-LAD, 80-90% LCx, 100% proximal RCA, some in-stent resteonsis of OM with IABP placed.
CT surgery was consulted for possible CABG, which the family deferred pending transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and repeat cardiac catheterization.
Of note, the patient received 4 units PRBCs at OSH for a hct of 28.7.

LBBB, 1-2 mm STD V4-V6, STD I. .
CXR [**11-12**]: Cardiomegaly, mild cephalization.
Cardiac Cath [**11-12**] PTCA COMMENTS: initial angiography showed severe diffsue disease throughout the LCX system with new tight lesion just proximal to the stent placed in [**Month (only) **] [**2104**].
The patient also was receiving NTG gtt and the IABP was set on 1:1 with augmented BP of 140 mmHg and mean of 65 mmHg.
We then advanced the wire into the jailed OM branch and performed several POBAs starting with a 2.0x12 mm Voyager RX at 6-12 ATM followed by 2.76x15 mm Quantum maverick balloon (at 6-8 ATM), each left up for 30-45 seconds.
Final angiography showed excellent flow into the LCX system with 0% residual stenosis within the stent and 40% residual stenosis in the OM branch (due to rapid recoil).
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 25866**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG and multiple PCIs most recently in [**4-21**], ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LVEF 25%, PAF, and [**Hospital **] transferred from an OSH for cardiac catheterization after VF arrest.
# Pump: Patient with known chronic systolic CHF with LVEF 25-30%.
Was euvolemic with minimal pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR and minimal signs of volume overload on exam.
# Hyponatremia: Baseline serum sodium of mid-130s, likely secondary to CHF, remained stable in-house.
# Anemia: Baseline hct in 30s and at baseline throughout hospitalization.
