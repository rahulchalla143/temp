Micro: MRSA screen pending .
Images: TTE ([**2165-1-9**])- The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-8-5**], the pericardial effusion is smaller.
Hypotension - transiently hypotensive post-op while in the PACU, likely [**3-7**] hypovolemia as BP improved with 4L of IV fluids.
Blood loss during surgical procedure reported to be 200cc, received 2 units of pRBC in the PACU.
TTE showed small pericardial effusion (consistent with prior) without tamponade physiology, pulsus of [**5-9**] mmHg.
BP improved to 120-130?????
Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted accordingly.
The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen.
