CT of the abdomen and pelvis negative.
CT of the cervical spine demonstrated a left C4 posterior ring fracture and a left C4 vertebral foramen fracture.
A CT of the left hip demonstrated a left acetabular fracture.
A four-vessel angiogram did not demonstrated any damage to the vessels.
An MRI/MRA of the neck demonstrated increased signal in the intraspinous C1 and C2 and in the posterior soft tissues posterior to the spinous processes of C3-C7.
Because of this tachycardia, a diagnostic peritoneal lavage was performed in the trauma bay in the Emergency Department.
After obtaining radiographs, he was subsequently transferred to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit for further observation.
Following his operation, the patient was extubated without any problem.
He was persistently tachycardiac with a rate averaging about 110.
To help observe any signs of withdraw, the patient was placed on a CIWA scale to follow for any signs of withdraw from his alcohol.
