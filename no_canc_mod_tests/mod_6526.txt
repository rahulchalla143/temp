PCWP was found to be 21/18/17 with PA pressure 34/17/25.
Noted on CT are multiple right-sided rib fractures, small right pleural effusion, communited nasal fracture.
A c-spine CT shows an acute small fracture "chip" at the anteroinferior corner of C5.
ABG was 7.29/47/119/24 and there was concern that he was developing respiratory acidosis secondary to splinting from his rib fractures.
Left arterial line was placed, and femoral sheath was removed, leaving a right-sided femoral venous catheter in place.
All of the other review of systems were negative except for tiredness.
Physical Exam: VS: T 96.7, BP 169/84, HR 108, RR 24, O2 100% on ??
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with ST elevations in III and V1-V3 with reciprocal depressions in I and aVL.
Post-cath EKG notable for continued ST elevations in V1-V2, III and depressions in I and aVL.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2181-10-6**] demonstrated:  non-dominant RCA, no CAD in LMCA, LAD, or LCx; balloon dilation of proximal RCA, re-stenosed, finally re-inflated with placement of BMS.
CT C/A/P ([**2181-10-6**]): CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of traumatic injury to the heart or great vessels and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion.
Lung windows reveal atelectasis at the right base.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands and pancreas are unremarkable.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon and prostate are unremarkable.
CT C-Spine [**10-6**]: A linear lucency at the anteroinferior corner of C5 likely represents a small acute fracture.
CT Head [**10-6**]: 1.
CT Head [**10-8**]: Compared with the prior head CT scan, there is no indication of interval development of an intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or visible major vascular territorial infarction.
The present study suggests the possibility of a punctate chronic lacunar-type infarct within the right cerebellar hemisphere.
A commensurate scan was not obtained so on the previous study, making it difficult to determine whether this finding has actually developed in the two days between scans, or more likely was present previously, but obscured by partial volume artifact.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis [**10-8**]: 1.
Right-sided lung effusion, which has slightly increased since the previous CT exam.
Persistent bilateral renal enhancement on the non-contrast study suggesting an element of ATN.
CT sinus mandible [**10-8**]: There is a massively comminuted nasal bone fracture bilaterally, and as indicated in your history, comminuted fracture also involving the nasal septum, as well as the anterior nasal spine.
MRI of Head on [**10-12**]: FINDINGS: There is a small focus of slow diffusion seen within the right cerebellar hemisphere with high signal on diffusion images and subtle low signal on ADC map consistent with a small acute infarct.
CT of Chest [**10-16**]: FINDINGS: The previously noted hemothorax on the right has markedly decreased, with bilateral small pleural effusions, measuring less than 20 [**Doctor Last Name **], with dependent atelectasis.
There is small apical and anterior and basilar pneumothorax, as seen on the prior chest x-ray.
The patient had a BMS stent placed in the proximal RCA complicated by distal embolization.
# Rhythm: Patient had multiple episodes of VFib in setting of RCA MI both in the ED as well as during cardiac catheterization requiring defibrillation.
The patient was monitored on telemetry and was without further conduction abnormalities or ventricular arrhythmias.
All initial cultures were negative, but patient treated with Vanc/Zosyn + azithromycin to cover atypical infection of sinuses.
Continued to have low grade temps and, blood cultures from [**10-21**] grew 1/4 bottles coag negative staph.
No evidence of intraabdominal or intracranial bleed on CT scan.
Check INR in 2days.
A cardiac catheterization was performed, and the cardiologists placed a stent to unblock one of the arteries that supplies your heart.
Have your INR checked again in 2 days.
