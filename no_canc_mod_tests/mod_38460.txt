History of Present Illness: The patient is a 75 year-old female who presented for elective cerebral angiography for evaluation of dural arteriovenous malformation.
Her initial NIHSS was 19.
Cerebral angiography revealed an occlusion of the M1 segment of the left MCA.
After  consent was obtained from her husband, [**Name (NI) **]-arterial t-PA was injected into the occluded artery.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 1+ radial, DP and PT pulses b/l.
Sensation [**Month/Year (2) 5235**] to light touch over face.
Neurologic exam after transfer to the floor: .
Sensation [**Month/Day (4) 5235**] to light touch and pinprick over face.
Radiologic Data: CT head: Note is made of hyperdense left frontal subdural fluid collection, which may represent acute subdural bleeding, or accumulation of the contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in this patient status post cerebral angiography.
Repeat CT-scan [**8-12**]: no evidence for a post tPA-hemorrhage; the reconstructions (to determine whether the blocked vessel had re-canalized) are pending.
ABDOMINAL/PELVIC IMAGING: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases demonstrate minuscule amount of pleural fluid and adjacent atelectasis.
The unenhanced images of the liver, spleen, adrenals, pancreas and unopacified loops of abdominal large and small bowel are unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Stranding is noted in the right groin consistent with recent puncture site.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 75 year-old female who presented for elective angiography for evaluation of a dural AVM, complicated by a left-MCA stroke with right hemiparesis and aphasia.
This slowly resolved and an infectious metabolic workup to explain the encephalopathy had been negative.
A CXR did not show pathology (other that small hiatal hernia).
Her LFTs were within normal limits and her amylase was elevated 205 but trending down (lipase was not elevated).
UA and repeat cultures were negative at the time of this dictation.
Her Hct was low, but no sources of bleeding were found (see next paragraph).
For further stroke prevention she is receiving ASA 325mg and lipitor 20mg (tc 208, ldl 122).
A repeat CT-scan [**8-12**] did not show evidence for a post tPA-hemorrhage (there was some mild contrast enhancement seen in the old frontal subdural hygroma although this could have been fresh blood; the reconstructions (to determine whether the blocked vessel had re-canalized) were pending.
A CT abdomen/pelvis ruled-out post t-PA hemorrhage.
Iron studies, B12, folate, and hemolysis labs did not point to any specific pathology.
Monitoring of stools and frequent checks of Hct are recommended as outpatient to make sure the Hct remains stable, which it was at discharge.
Cardiovascular: Patient's blood pressure was monitored.
FEN: She passed a speech and swallow evaluation and tolerated a cardiac healthy diet.
