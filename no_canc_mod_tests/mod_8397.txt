Her ABG showed pH 7.21, CO2 71, oxygen of 76.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Heart rate 89, respiratory rate 22, blood pressure 112/82.

Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia with incomplete right bundle branch block.
She was continued on the face mask for her oxygen and still required 35 to 40% oxygen.
On the day of discharge her oxygen saturation was 96% on three liters nasal cannula.
She will also need to have PFTs done when she is more stable.
Her gram stain did show 3+ gram positive cocci in pair, unchanged, 10 to 25 polymorphonuclear cells and less than 10 epithelials cells.
EAR, NOSE AND THROAT - The patient complained of dizziness during the course of admission.
She initially refused an MRI because of her claustrophobia.
A head CT scan without contrast was done and it was negative for any mass affect or edema.
However with her family's persuasion she agreed to do an MRI to rule out any masses.
RENAL FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION - The patient was hyponatremic and hypokalemic on admission.
However repeat sodium was 133 and repeat potassium was 3.6.
Her LFTs were negative and her pancreatic enzymes were negative.
She was sent for  H pylori antibody testing which was still pending.
Her hematocrit was stable so she was not having any active bleeding.
