In the ED, initial vitals included a HR of 90, BP 191/104, Temp 98 F, RR 18, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 4L NC.
An EKG showed ST elevations in II, III, AVF, V5, and V6.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 10 cm.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: [**2180-8-21**] EKG :Rate 83, normal axis, normal sinus rhythm with marked ST segment elevations in II, III, aVF, V4-V6 suggestive of inferior and lateral acute myocardial infarction.
[**2180-8-21**] CXR : Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed.
Resting hemodyanmics revealed normal right sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 5 mm Hg.
PA systolic pressure was normal at 25 mm Hg.
There was systemic arterial hypertension with a BP of 190/90 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was decreased at 1.8 L/min/m2.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

As aforementioned, the patient's presenting EKG showed ST elevations in II, III, AVF, V5, and V6 indicative of inferior and lateral acute myocardial infarction or STEMI.
He had a small right groin hematoma after his catheterization sheath pull but otherwise he had no major complications post-operatively.
The right groin catheterization entry site was less swollen and the patient was hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital stay and he maintained a stable hematocrit throughout his hospitalization.
He was advised that he should follow-up in approximately 3 weeks for a stress MIBI to help risk stratify the LAD lesion which was noted on cardiac catheterization.
A follow-up echo post-cath showed LVEF 50%, mild LVH and some regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild focal hypokinesis of the basal inferior/inferoseptal segments was seen.
Throughout his CCU stay the patient was monitored on telemetry and he had no significant ectopy, just a few episodes of sinus tachycardia.
Also of note, the patient had a slight elevation in his BUN/Cr which was attributed to mild dehydration and the patient was encouraged to increase his fluid intake.
Electrolyte labs revealed some hypophosphatemia which was felt to be secondary to respiratory alkalosis in the setting of ACS.
He was given Neutra-Phos and his Phosphorus level bumped from 2.5 to 3.3.
On hospital day 2 the patient complained of some mild urinary urgency and a basic UA was sent along with a urine culture.
Both studies were negative for any signs of infection and the patient's urgency had resolved by time of discharge.
A lipid profile was done and showed Triglycerides 231, total cholesterol 177, LDL 98 and HDL 33.
He will plan to recheck a lipid panel and Chem-7 on [**9-19**] and results will be called into Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
He had a slight LFT increase during his hospitalization which was attributed to his acute MI.
AST and ALT levels gradually tapered down towards a normal baseline prior to discharge.
