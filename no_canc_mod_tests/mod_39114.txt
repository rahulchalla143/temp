Patient was admitted to the MICU given heart rate abnormalities (tachycardia) and h/o hypotension (reportedly to the 50s systolic).
A repeat Hct was checked and verified to be stable.
Notably, she does seem to have a colitis on CT abdomen/pelvis, which is read as most likely being infectious in etiology.
Finally, a CXR read states a possible PNA, however given clinical picture, no treatment for PNA was started.
After her MICU stay and IVF resuscitation, she was transferred to the medical floor where she was continued on cipro/flagyl.
