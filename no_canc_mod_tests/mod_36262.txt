CXR showed a RML consolidation suggestive of pneumonia, and patient was given ceftriaxone and metronidazole out of concern for respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia.
She was also given duonebs, three doses of IV lopressor, and 250 cc IVF, followed by 60 mg IV furosemide due to CXR signs of pulmonary edema.

CVP between [**5-11**].
