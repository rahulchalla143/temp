Initial CXR from [**Last Name (un) 4068**] demonstrated enlarged L pleural effusion.
While at [**Location (un) 620**], had CT chest which demonstrated large pericardial effusion / L pleural effusion.
CT chest showed no mediastinal or hilar LAD.
Past Medical History: Multiple sclerosis (wheelchair bound) History of basal cell ca on her nose, removed  Social History: Former pediatrician.
The initial pericardial pressure equaled the RA pressure (10 mmHg).
Pericardiocentesis was performed and approximately 220 ml of sero-sanguinous fluid was removed until pericardial pressure was less than 0.
TTE [**2169-3-15**] 7 pm: There continues to be a moderate to large pericardial effusion.
TTE [**2169-3-15**]: EF 70-75%, 1+MR, 1+TR, large pericardial effusion, question of loculation, echodense, no tamponade, no RV collapse .
CT chest [**2169-3-14**]: No mediastinal or hilar LAD, L left pleural effusion, collapsed LLL, small R effusion, no pneumonia.
ESR 46 CRP 7.2 .
[**3-13**] Blood cx NGTD [**3-14**] Blood cx pend [**3-13**] Urine cx negative   Brief Hospital Course: 48 F with PMH MS (wheelchair bound) presenting with intermittent fevers, pericardial effusion and pleural effusion.
Analysis of the fluid was consistent with an exudate (see pertinent results).
Cytology showed 79% lymphocytes, some activated forms consistent with a reactive process.
Microbiology studies showed no bacterial or fungal growth.
Acid fast culture continues to show NGTD, but the AFB smear was negative.
Repeat pulsus checks were consistently 6.
CT surgery performed VATS to evacuate the pericardial effusion without complication.
TTE showed EF 70%, 1+ MR, 1+ TR.
All autoimmune and vasculitic markers checked returned negative.
Pericardial biopsy showed Gram positive cocci only growing in broth, which may be contamination.
Biopsy showed lymphocytes, degranulating eosinophils, and a few scattered PMNs.
Tissue culture needs to be followed after discharge, although the effusion is unlikely to be caused by a bacterial infection because the patient has clinically been asymptomatic other than fevers.
To evaluate for a source of possible malignancy and L pleural effusion seen on CXR, she was sent for a CT with IV and oral contrast following the pericardiocentesis which showed a large left pleural exudative effusion, small right pleural effusion, indeterminant 1.4-cm adrenal nodule, dilated common duct measuring 7-8 mm with no obvious obstructing source.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, fevers .
