A repeat chest computerized tomography scan was done to evaluate the patient's persistent carbon dioxide retention.
The computerized tomography scan revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Therefore her right pleural effusion was tapped and drained and studies were sent to rule out empyema or parapneumonic effusion.
Two days later, the patient had her left effusion taped dry and similar studies were sent.
Her bicarbonate was 36 at the time of discharge, down from a maximum of 40.
This patient's oxygen saturation should be titrated to the low 90s to encourage ventilation.
