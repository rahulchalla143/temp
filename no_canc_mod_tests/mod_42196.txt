He regained consciousness as soon as he hit the ground, was pale and clammy with vitals of pulse 80 regular, BP 80/50.
He was able to sit up and walked 8 paces to an exam table.
Seen at BIDN where EKG showed difuse STE, and formal echo showed moderate-sized pericardial effusion with some evidence of RV collapse by report.
His repeat BP was 120/60, pulse 78/min, stable, alert and oriented.

ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):  BLOOD CULTURE [**2117-7-12**] NO GROWTH TO DATE PERICARDIAL FLUID CULTURE [**2117-7-13**] NO GROWTH TO DATE PERICARDIAL FLUID CYTOLOGY [**2117-7-13**] PENDING  [**2117-7-12**] ECHO: LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
GENERAL COMMENTS: Emergency study performed by the cardiology fellow on call.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-7-12**], the findings are similar  [**2117-7-14**] ECHO: This study was compared to the prior study of [**2117-7-13**].
Conclusions FOCUSED STUDY POST-PERICARDIOCENTESIS: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-7-13**], left ventricular function appears more vigorous.
CXR [**2117-7-14**]: previous images.
Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged.
Brief Hospital Course: 29 yo M w/ no significant PMH presented with pleuritic chest pain and syncope (likely vasovagal) and was found to have a pericardial effusion with a Pulsus of 12 and early tamponade physiology on TTE who underwent successful pericardiocentesis with improved chest pressure.
-discharged on colchicine and ibuprofen -will f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of cardiology to determine course of treatment -Multiple pericarld fluid studies are still pending  #Syncope- patient had syncope on admission and it was in teh setting of pain, and therefore likely due to a vasovagal event as opposed to his pericardial effusion.
Information was obtained from Patient.
Transitional Issues: Pending labs: Pericardial Fluid studies from [**2117-7-13**], including cytology  Medications started: 1.
You should see a cardiologist as per below and will need a repeat echocardiogram (ultrasound of your heart).
