**ACUTE ISSUES** # Acute Renal Failure: He presented in acute renal failure with creatinine of 10.4 (baseline 0.9), hyperkalemia, and EKG changes.
His ARF was largely attributed to obstruction as he was retaining over 500cc urine and found to have large symmetric prostate on DRE.
Potassium levels dropped with administration of kayexalate, insulin, and bicarbonate.
Serial EKGS also showed resolution of peaked T waves.
His blood sugars were managed on sliding scale insulin.
His oral hypoglycemics were held, with the goal of transitioning back to agents after renal approval and Cr normalization.
Previous biopsy was benign.
**CHRONIC ISSUES** # Hypertension: He was found to be hypertensive to SBP 180s during the admission as his ACE-I was held in light of his ARF.
Information was obtained from Patient.
