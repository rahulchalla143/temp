Multiple CT scans and cholangiograms.
This required massive resuscitation and blood transfusion.
She underwent a CAT scan of the abdomen which demonstrated a large cystic appearing lesion within the medial segment of the left lobe and the anterior segment of the right lobe of the liver as well as a large amount of ascites.
Cultures of the abscess and the bile grew out Enterococcus that was sensitive to vancomycin.
She had multiple episodes of diarrhea which had been treated for C.diff colitis at the outside institution and the cultures did not grow Clostridium difficile at this institution.
During the remainder of her hospital course she had several episodes of fever and elevated white count that prompted further imaging studies and no residual abscess within the peritoneal cavity could be documented.
The catheter drained approximately 40 to 50 cc of bile stained fluid on a daily basis, the cultures of which also grew Enterococcus and gram negative rods.
The transhepatic catheters were internalized and her bilirubin remained slightly elevated, but did not bump any higher.
