He was found to have an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure at the [**Hospital1 882**] and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
The patient's catheterization was uncomplicated and he was scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass graft on Monday [**2125-9-10**].
In preparation preoperatively he had an echocardiogram, which showed an ejection fraction of 15 to 20% and apical inferior and basal akinesis.
This was in contrast to his transthoracic echocardiogram study in [**2124-5-5**] that showed an ejection fraction of 50%, mild hypokinesis of the inferobasal wall.
Further preoperative evaluation included diuresis with Lasix as well as carotid doppler ultrasound studies, which demonstrated 60% occlusion in the left carotid artery and essentially clean right carotid artery.
Initially his vital signs were stable.
Repeat hematocrit showed that this was stable since the prior study four hours earlier.
Over the next couple of minutes the patient's blood pressure was noticed to drop from the systolic high 110s to 80/40.
The patient's blood pressure responded to this intervention.
