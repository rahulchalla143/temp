This was felt to be likely related to line infection, and Quentin was d/c'd after IR placed new groin line and INR was reduced with FFP.
However the line tip culture was negative (after treating through the line for 5 days).
L knee film showed small effusion, and MR. [**Known lastname 4154**] refused a tap by the ortho team.
L ankle film showed mild soft tissue swelling, no bony injury, no evidence osteomyelitis.
Sputum cultures were negative, and he is anuric.
CT abd/pelvis/spine shows no source of sepsis.
Surveillance blood cultures have been negative since [**36**]/08/5, and he should receive repeat surveillance cultures once vancomycin course completed.
After surveillance blood cultures were negative, a new tunneled groin line was placed for HD on his L side.
