Admission Date:  [**2183-8-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2183-8-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-6-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old male resident of the [**Hospital3 6560**] Home who was transferred to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 1760**] for evaluation of possible aspiration pneumonia.
At the nursing home his temperature was noted to be 99.6, pulse in the 120s, blood pressure 140/70, respiratory rate 18-22.
In the emergency room he was hypotensive to systolic blood pressure of 73 and diastolic blood pressure of 49, tachycardic to 127, febrile to 100.9 by axillary thermometer.
Laboratory studies drawn in the emergency room showed a blood glucose level in the 700s, serum sodium 167, and a highly concentrated urine with specific gravity of 1.036.
His blood pressure increased to a systolic blood pressure in the 100s with two liters of normal saline intravenously.
He was transferred to the MICU for further evaluation and treatment.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 100.0, heart rate 114, blood pressure 91/56, oxygen saturation 94% on two liters nasal cannula.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
LABORATORY DATA:  In the emergency room sodium was 167, potassium 4.3, chloride 128, bicarbonate 20, BUN 76, creatinine 1.1, glucose 736.
WBC 14.6 with 89 neutrophils and no bands.
Hematocrit 48.
Platelet count 226.
A second SMA-7 showed a sodium of 167 and glucose 724.
Arterial blood gases on two liters nasal cannula showed pH 7.40, PCO2 37, PO2 67.
His urinalysis revealed slightly hazy urine with a specific gravity of 1.036.
The urine was nitrite negative, ketone negative, with 14 red blood cells and six white blood cells, and moderate bacteria.
Chest x-ray showed patchy air space disease in the left lower lung zone, consistent with a possible aspiration pneumonia.
The patient's free water deficit was calculated to be greater than 10 liters when the serum sodium was corrected for the hyperglycemia.
He was started initially on normal saline until his blood pressure returned to [**Location 213**] levels.
Once the blood pressure was stable, his intravenous fluid was changed to half normal saline, with an aim of decreasing his serum sodium at a rate of 0.5 mEq per liter per hour.
His sodium declined gradually.
He was treated with an insulin drip in the MICU until his serum glucose dropped below 200.
His fever and elevated white blood cell count were thought to be secondary to either a urinary tract infection or an aspiration pneumonia.
His oxygenation improved with supplemental oxygen and he had copious white sputum production.
Blood cultures remained negative.
Urine cultures grew Pseudomonas and Enterococcus.
These were thought to be urine colonizers and not a source of infection.
As his serum sodium corrected and his free water deficit declined, Mr. [**Known lastname **] mental status improved slightly.
He will have an SMA-7 drawn on [**2183-8-23**] to check his serum sodium level.
