Head CT revealed large R intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
INR 3.1; received VitK x1.
Also received Ativan 1mg x1 and Labetalol 15mg x1.
In the [**Hospital1 **] ED, repeat head CT obtained.
Past Medical History: - MI (10 years ago) - s/p cardiac arrest (in setting of MI) - Hypercholesterolemia - Hypertension  Social History: Was living with his wife prior to hospitalization.
Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on admission: T 97.1 HR 77 BP 150/110 RR 13 O2sat 100% Gen - Intubated, sedated HEENT - NCAT, MMM pink, cervical collar in place CV - RRR, no m/r/g Lungs - good air movement throughout Abd - soft, NDNT Ext - 2+distal pulses, cap refill <2sec  Neuro Exam: MS - Sedated.
DTR - 2+ [**Hospital1 19912**] reflexes in UE bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: [**2167-9-28**] PT 21.4 INR 3.14 PTT 36.8 Serum tox neg  HEAD CT [**2167-9-28**] - Large R basal ganglia/frontal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma (3.7x7.8) w/associated edema and moderate (1.1cm) midline shift leftward.
[**2167-10-1**] - stable  EEG [**2167-10-7**] - Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features  BILATERAL LE ULTRASOUND [**2167-10-5**] - Occlusive superficial venous thrombosis w/in R greater saphenous vein extending to 1 cm from the junction with the common femoral vein.
ECHO [**2167-10-7**] - Normal LV systolic function, EF>55%.
REPEAT CT SCAN [**10-23**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CV - Blood pressure initially controlled with Labetalol gtt.
The week of [**10-19**], he had increased heart rate with low blood pressures, and was unable to tolerate these antihypertensives.
He tolerated this dose well, and when his heart rate trended up the following week, the digoxin dose was increased to 0.250 mg.  Diltiazem was continued but with strict holding parameters for sbp<105 (and hr 60).
Metoprolol was discontinued, as his blood pressures had dropped to the 80s systolic.
However fever persisted after CXR improved and weaned from ventilator support.
Extensive fever workup (in conjunction with consulting ID service) included multiple negative blood, urine and sputum cultures, negative Cdiff, negative chest/abd/pelvis CT, and negative echocardiogram (no vegetations).
One out of >10 blood cultures  grew two colonies of coag negative staph at >24hours, thought to represent a contaminated specimen.
To be sure, a white blood cell tagged scan was performed on the day of discharge.
CBC should be checked, and the trach site should be inspected.
On [**10-16**], lower extremity ultrasounds were performed to look for lower ext DVTs and initially found superficial clot only.
Repeat scan 10 days later showed extension of the right superficial saphenous clot into the common femoral(non-occlusive).
Mannitol and Captopril were stopped, and the creatinine returned to baseline of 0.6-1.0, where it has since remained.
Ortho - Pt was found down.
C-spine imaging negative for fracture, but patient must be awake and able to answer "yes" or "no" to pain in order for his c-spine to be cleared.
Prophylaxis - pneumoboots, coumadin, bowel regimen, prevacid.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid [**Hospital1 **]: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed.
His INR and digoxin level should be checked two days after arrival at rehab.
