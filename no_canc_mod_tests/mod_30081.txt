Decreased aeration of the lungs, right upper lobe in particular, Repeat chest x-ray following endotracheal tube repositioning recommended.
[**12-7**]: Noncontrast Head CT: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain with ventricular catheter and aneurysmal clip again identified.
The ETT should be pulled back 4 cm.
[**12-8**]: CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**12-8**]: CXR- FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior study from [**2108-12-7**].
The patient is markedly rotated on the study which limits evaluation.
Consolidation at the right lung base is improving.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[**12-19**]: Head CT w/o contrast- IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged appearance of the brain, without acute intracranial hemorrhage.
[**12-19**]: CT c-spine-IMPRESSION: Degenerative changes.
Lung nodules measuring less than 5 mm in the left upper lobe, not fully evaluated on this cervical spine CT scan.

Trimethoprim/Sulfa sensitivity testing confirmed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].
She had a sputum which was + for H flu and had evidence of RML pneumonia.
Echocardiogram showed preserved EF; she was diuresed daily with improvment in CXR and in her clinical status.
She underwent head and neck CT for c/o cervical cord injury (unable to get MRI [**2-2**] metal aneurysm clips).
The CT showed no cervical spinal injury.
Admission cultures revealed an E coli UTI, H flu pneumonia, and prevotella bacteremia.
All of her antibiotics were stopped as of [**12-24**] as no further positive blood culture and patient remained afebrile.
Stool was guaiac negative and CT chest, abdomen, pelvis showed no signs of bleeding.
Her blood levels were stable after transfusion of 1U pRBCs.
Echo was essentially normal.
Her CXR normalized and was found to have a contraction alkalosis (and was therefore given acetazolamide) and increasing BUN/Cr.
# DM2- On admission she was controlled on SSI alone, this had to be increased to an insulin gtt, which was then transitioned back to SSI, NPH.
