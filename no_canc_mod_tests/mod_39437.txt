Iron stain shows no stainable iron.
Color Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] was performed, demonstrating patent SMV, splenic vein, and IVC.
[**2101-12-1**]  	Radiology	CT ABD W&W/O C CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: MDCT imaging was performed from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis in non-contrast, portal venous, and 10-minute delayed phases.
This imaging was performed only through the abdomen.
Stomach and abdominal loops of bowel appear normal; however, there are likely esophageal and gastric varices.
Left upper pole renal lesion which appears to have thick septations and an MRI of the kidney should be performed to better evaluate and exclude malignancy.
MRI should be performed to further evaluate.
He underwent banding; however, has developed 500 cc hematemesis subsequently and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Pt had a liver biopsy performed on [**11-29**].
Pt was also treated with ceftriaxone 1g iv q24h ([**11-30**]/-[**12-3**]), Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H, and sucralfate 1mg qid.
Final pathology showed congenital hepatic fibrosis.
On CT abdomen, multiple renal lesions were noted.
Pt will need repeat EGD in one month, and he has been schedule for liver follow-up at [**Hospital1 18**].
Recommended 24 hr urine, cr, urea, protein, and followup in outpatient nephrology clinic with outpatient MRI w/ contrast of kidney to r/o malignancy.
Blood cx showed no growth.
UA 55 RBCs, 9 WBCs, no bacteria (w/ foley).
CXR showed no evidence to suggest pneumonia or aspiration.
He will need repeat EGDs in the near future to control and monitor any significant varices.
-Pt will need renal follow-up for polycystic kidney disease including outpatient MRI to rule out malignancy in L upper pole mass.
-If Pt has polycystic kidney disease, Pt may need additional testing such as MRA head to look for aneurysms, and genetic counseling.
)(s)* Refills:*0* 2. sucralfate 1 gram Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day for 4 weeks.
You had an emergent upper endoscopy during which you were found to have many varices (dilated blood vessels) in your esophagus and stomach, and very high pressure in the blood vessels of your abdomen (the portal system).
You had a second bleed, and you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Your blood levels were stable here, and your breathing tube was removed.
You had a liver biopsy here, which showed that you have a condition called congenital hepatic fibrosis.
On CT imaging of your abdomen, we found that you have many cyst-like lesions on both of your kidneys.
****You will need further imaging and tests.
Followup Instructions: You will need an MRI of your kidneys.
