An MRI was obtained, which demonstrated a compression fracture of the anterior aspect of the L2 vertebral body, with minimal associated T2 and STIR signal abnormalities.
Abdominal CT was obtained.
This CT of the abdomen and pelvis did not show any evidence of thoraco- aortic dissection.
The patient then proceeded to surgery on [**2200-5-16**], and underwent abdominal aortogram with selective celiac angiogram, angioplasty, and stenting of the celiac artery through a left brachial artery access.
White count was 13.4, hematocrit 31.5, BUN 30, creatinine 1.0.
Physical examination was remarkable for a soft, nontender abdomen with bowel sounds.
The patient's head CT scan was remarkable for periventricular white matter changes and an old right insular infarct.
