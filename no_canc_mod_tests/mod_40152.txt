Further imaging was obtained in the ED showing extravasation from injured spleen and liver.
CV: The patient arrived to the ICU hemodynamically stable with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] vasopressor support, subsequently successfully weaned following abdominal closure HD 2 with intermittent use until HD 6 Pressors: Single-[**Doctor Last Name 360**] vasopressor support was utilized for blood pressure support during immediate post-operative period and subsequently weaned without issue.
CTA chest [**8-21**] was negative for PE.
Serial CXR were obtained given presence of R chest tube without evidence of reaccumulation.
During work-up for persistent leukocytosis, CT was obtained which demonstrated fluid collection in LUQ which was subsequently drained by IR.
Subsequent fluoroscopic examination of this collection demonstrated a small gastric perforation communicating with aforementioned fluid collection which was subsequently repaired endoscopically.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound care:  Incisional wounds were regularly monitored for signs of infection of which there were none.
Hematology: The patient was found to be hypotensive on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and large amount free hemorrhage was found in abdomen on exploratory laparotomy [**8-17**].
13 units pRBCs were administered on [**8-17**] with flat hct in mid 30s.
Following operative intervention,  the patient's complete blood count was examined routinely with single transfusion requirement [**8-30**] for asymptomatic anemia.
Given patient's antibody cross-reactivity, blood bank staff was involved early in the post-operative care of this patient.
A follow up head CT  in 6 weeks was initially recommended by neurosurgery, who had signed off after multiple stable head CT's and improvement in mental status.
CV: His vital signs were monitored routinely while on the floor and remained stable and afebrile.
He remained on room air with stable oxygen saturations and no respiratory compromise.
GI/GU: The patient had a formal speech and swallow evaluation as well as a video swallow study.
On [**9-4**] he was found to have a UTI and was started on a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin to be completed on [**9-10**].

His hematocrit remained stable.
Incisions were continually monitored for signs and symptoms of infection.
Endocrine: His blood sugars were monitored while on the floor and remained within normal limits with no need for coverage with insulin sliding scale, which was d/c'd on [**2189-9-8**].
Followup Instructions: Please follow up for a repeat CT scan of the head in 4 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] in the [**Hospital 4695**] clinic.
