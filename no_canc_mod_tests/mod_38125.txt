CXR on admission with RLL opacity highly suspicious for aspiration pneumonia or pre-existing pneumonia.
Sputum cultures grew staph aureus, possibly reflective of infection vs. colonization.
-Blood cultures from [**8-15**] and [**2150-8-18**] pending at time of discharge  #) Proteus mirabilis UTI: On [**2150-7-30**] she had cloudy urine and increased incontinence for which she was given a 7-day course of Bactrim for what was found to be a Klebsiella UTI.
UA on admission showed large leuks, neg nitrites and she was started on meropenem for empric [**Year (4 digits) 40097**] coverage, though [**Year (4 digits) **] eventually grew >100k CFU of meropenem-sensitive proteus mirabilis  #) Hypotension: She was normotensive in the ED but became hypotensive to SBPs in the 80s while in the MICU soon after admission.
Notably, she lives in the SBPs 90s-100s per outpatient BP reads over the past few years.
She developed a fever to 102.1F and also was found to have a Proteus UTI (>100K) on [**Last Name (LF) 21574**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she had a possible urosepsis picture.
-Careful monitoring of polypharamcy with multiple sedating medications -Adherence to narcotics agreement and appointment at pain clinic   CHRONIC ISSUES: # COPD/ Chronic Hypercarbia: On 2L O2 at home.
-Rescheduled pain clinic appointment (missed during admission)  #)Urinary Retention: Patient usually self-catheterizes at home but foley catheter used during admission extending past period needed for UOP monitoring because of patient request.
Hct 34.5 on admission, 28.8 at time of discharge.
A chest xray showed a pneumonia in your right lung and a urine study showed a urinary tract infection.
You received antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) for eight days during your stay in the intensive care unit and your breathing improved and the breathing tube was removed.
