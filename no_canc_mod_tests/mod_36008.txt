On [**7-15**] due to concern for worsening of her swallowing, she underwent a neck CT which showed presistent collection.
Abscess cultures grew out strep viridans, and an ID consultation was obtained.
Close f/u with OMFS and subsequent CT imaging of her abscesses revealed that these were decreasing in size.
Her lung exam revealed crackles halfway up her lung fields and her CXR looked wet, but without evidence of pneumonia.
During her MICU stay, she had a sputum culture which grew out H. influenza and Enterobacter that was negative for beta-lactamase.
Her creatinine trended down during her hospitalization.
Her creatinine increased slighlty after stopping her tube feeds.
# Postive blood culture:  Her admission blood culture [**2-4**] grew out gram positive cocci.
The gram positive cocci grew out to be coag negative staph which was thought to be a contaminant so the vancomycin was stopped.
