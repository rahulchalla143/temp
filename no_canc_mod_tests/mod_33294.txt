Cardiac Echo [**6-4**]: Conclusions Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20--25%).
Right ventricular systolic function and size is normal.
CT C-spine [**6-4**]: IMPRESSIONS: 1.
Blood in the basal cisterns tracking inferiorly and anteriorly along the brainstem and upper spinal cord.
Findings along with chest radiograph likely represents some pulmonary edema, although aspiration cannot be excluded.
CT Head [**6-5**]: FINDINGS: The diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage appears stable in extent.
CXR [**2165-6-5**] Final Report INDICATION: 52-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage, dilated cardiomyopathy.
Single AP chest radiographs compared to 13 hours prior shows no change.
IMPRESSION: Compared to prior exam from [**2165-6-5**], there is no change in the extent of pulmonary edema.
Cardiac Echo : [**2165-6-11**] Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-6-4**], left ventricular systolic function has improved.
[**2165-6-25**] 12:25 PM CT HEAD CT: Axial imaging was performed through the brain without IV contrast administration.
COMPARISON: CT head [**2165-6-23**].
The paranasal sinuses, ethmoid, and mastoid air cells are clear.
COMPARISON: CT chest dated [**2165-6-7**].
1.2-cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver, as appreciated on CT of the chest dated [**2165-6-7**].
Head CT performed showing diffuse SAH.
CTA of head also performed with preliminarily identified an aneurysm at the left ICA bifurcation.
She also had a cardiac echo done for concerns of a catacholamine induced cardiomyopathy(had developed pulmonary edema), which showed significantly depressed cardic function.
She had an angiogram done on [**6-4**], when the left distal ICA aneurysm was coiled.
On [**6-5**](overnight) she had a ICP elevation to 50 and the drain was promplty dropped to 10cm, and ICP normalized.
Emergent head CT was done which showed likely evolving brifrontal hypoattenuations/possible stroke.
She again returned to angio on [**6-6**] to further evaluate vascualar patency given this new CT finding.The patient was febrile with a Tmax 101.6 and was pan cultured,the urine and cerebral spinal fluid cultures were both neagtive.
Blood cultures were found to be negative.
The sputum culture was positive for rare yeast.On [**6-7**]: The patient had an acute PaO2 decrease to 50%.
The CTA of the Chest was not consistent with Pulmonary embolus.
The CT Head was unchanged.
The urine and sputum cultures were both negative.
A head CT ordered for elevated ICP to 44, Mannitol was initiated for increased ICPs.
A CTA was performed which was consistent with a slight decrease in intercranial vasospasm.
On [**6-9**], The patient required 3 doses of mannitol for sustained ICP levels of 23.
There were no changes in the patients mental status with these ICP increases.On exam the patient was intermitently following commands in the right upper extremity, the left upper extremity moved to command, the left lower extremity and Right upper extremity withdrew to pain,the patients eyes were open and tracked with her eyes.
On [**6-10**], The patient was back on a dobutamine gtt continuously to maintain a goal blood pressure, The patient had a TEE which was consistent with Ejection F of 20%.
The LENIS were negative for deep vein thrombosis, The CSF and sputum cultures were negative.
On [**6-11**], The patient underwent an angio which was consistent with mild to mod vasospasm.
The Head CT was repeated and was stable.
The patient was extubated and stopped nimodpine for systolic blood pressure in 60's.The goal MAP > 100 and dobutamine was restarted.
[**6-14**] CT shows:new stroke in the posterior left MCA distribution CTA shows diffuse, severe vasospasm involving the bilateral MCAs (left worse than right)the following day she underwent a cerebral angiogram which showed Mild to moderate spasm Left A1,2 and M1,2 segments though her exam seemed to slightly improve with brisk localization on LUE and localization on RUE though not as brisk as left.
Positive blood cx from arterial line and appearance of axillary A line, concerned for line infection and she was treated for line associated bacteremia for 7 day course.
On discharge her neurological exam she preferred her eyes closed would open to voice, questionable following commands  with left side.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
You will need to have a CT scan of the head without contrast at that time    Completed by:[**2165-7-3**
