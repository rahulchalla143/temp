CXR ([**5-6**]): IMPRESSION: Heart failure.
TTE [**5-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-3-17**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
Suspect pneumonia given fevers, leukocytosis, focal RLL infiltrate on CXR, and rather acute onset of symptoms.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative.
# Bacteremia: One blood culture from admission labs came back positive for STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE, sensitive to levofloxacin.
Surveillance blood cultures were negative.
An echocardiogram was performed during this admission, showing findings similar to her prior echo, except for possibly increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
EKG shows new increased voltage consistent with LVH.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled x2 [**32**]-hours apart and were negative.
