CT chest and CXR revealed large new R effusion vs RLL collapse.
BP in 80-90's, most likely not due to GIB.

Heart size cannot be accurately assessed.
[**1-9**] CT CHEST AND ABDOMEN IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited non-contrast evaluation, but no evidence of catastrophic injury to the aorta, or esophagus.
[**1-10**] ECHO The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-12-29**], regional LV systolic dysfunction is now seen.
Admitted to MICU initially for evaluation of possible UGIB, then transferred to floor for further management.
GI did not feel that she warranted an EGD if her HCT remained stable and agreed that the most likely etiology was a MW tear.
Hct remained stable.
O2 requirements were decreased to 3L NC although repeat CXR only showed minimal improvement.
Sputum culture initially showed 1+ gram positive cocci in pairs.
The pt received a bronchoscopy to evaluate hemoptysis which showed diffuse inflammation consistent with RSV bronchitis (positive viral culture) with no obstruction of bronchi and no masses.
# Acute on chronic renal failure - appeared to be pre-renal in nature (FEUrea 24.5%), with Cr 3.5 on admission.
Returned to baseline (2.0) with IVF, with Cr 1.7 on discharge.
Serum uric acid 10.1 with xrays suggestive of gout.
Given splint, and started Prednisone 40mg QD x 3 days (to be tapered after discharge) per Rheumatology recs, will f/u with nephrologist for uric acid monitoring and starting Allopurinol in [**12-30**] weeks.
ECHO did not show any evidence of acute wall motion abnormalities related to ACS and Cardiology felt that the troponin leak was most likely related to demand ischemia.
On the floor, BP was adequately controlled on Clonidine alone.
Disp:*10 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: RSV bronchitis Diastolic chronic heart failure Acute on chronic renal failure Gout Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of shortness of breath, need for oxygen, and [**Hospital3 **] in your sputum, as well as [**Hospital3 **] after vomiting.
You were also dehydrated causing acute kidney failure with a creatinine level higher than your baseline.
You had a bronchoscopy to determine why you had [**Hospital3 **] in your sputum.
The bronchoscopy showed only inflammation of your airways consistent with a viral (RSV) bronchitis.
Your hematocrit remained stable for the rest of your hospital stay and you did not have any more episodes of bleeding.
Followup Instructions: You should have your INR and [**Date Range **] pressure checked on Monday [**2167-1-19**] at 9.45AM at the [**Hospital 197**] clinic in [**Hospital3 **].
You will have a repeat chest cat scan prior to this appointment on [**2167-2-24**] at 8.15AM on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**], [**Location (un) 470**].
