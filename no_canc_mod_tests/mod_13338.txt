Electrolytes have been adjusted in his parenteral nutrition and his most recent set of electrolytes was on the morning of [**2117-1-8**], with a sodium of 132, potassium 3.6, chloride 103, bicarbonate 25.
In the first 24 hours of life, he required four boluses of D10W for blood sugars which were less than 40.
He was advanced to 13 percent dextrose in his parenteral nutrition where he will get infusion rate of 8.1.
Late on the night of [**2117-1-7**], Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 58719**] experienced hyperglycemia with blood sugar as high as 350.
