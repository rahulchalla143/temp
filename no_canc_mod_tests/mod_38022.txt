Of note, pt had INR checked on the Friday before admission (3 days ago) and had an INR of 6.0.
Therefore, he held his coumadin and his INR on admission was 2.1 (goal 3.5-4.0).
EKG showed no new ischemic changes and old Q waves in II,III and avF.
Had Stress MIBI which showed severe myocardial perfusion defect involving the entire inferior wall, partially reversible, moderate, myocardial perfusion defect involving the inferolateral and lateral walls.
EKG showed STE MI, with tombstoning in V2-V4, c/w anterior MI in LAd distribution.
He was urgently taken for catheterization which showed: LAD-90% before D1, 70% after D1; LCX-severe pro dz, mid occlusion, collaterals from left to right; RCA: diffuse disease with serial lesions to 70% just before bifurcation.
His LAD was stented x 2 (hepacoat proximal overlapped with zeta stent).
VL <50 [**4-14**].
He still smokes 2 ppd but has cut down from 4 ppd for a total of 40 years.

Transit ischemic dilatation and hypokinesis of the left ventricle with EF of 27%.
Cath [**2187-6-6**]-LAD-90% before D1, 70% after D1; LCX-severe pro dz, mid occlusion, collaterals from left to right; RCA: diffuse disease with serial lesions to 70% just before bifurcation.
RA 11, RV 44/2, P/A 44/22 29 mean, PCWP 22.
Cath showed 3VD and s/p stents x 2 to LAD.
RFs for pt include FHx CAD, HTN, smoking, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
Heparin was continued after catheterization (goal 60-80) as well as Integrilin for 18 hours post-cath.
Cath showed elevated PCWP.
Repeat echo showed: EF 25% and global HK.
We initially held his nitrate and diltiazem because systolic BP was in 80s.
His goal INR is 3.5-4.0 as with APLA syndrome as well as a history of PE in the past ('[**75**]).
Pt was started on Coumadin 10 mg qhs; was on heparin gtt (goal 60-80) which was d/ced [**6-10**] when INR 3.6.
Additionally, CTA was done to look for PE and was negative ([**2187-6-5**]).
Had supratheraputic INR on day of discharge, so will decrease coumadin to 2.5 X 2 days, then restart 5mg daily.
Acute renal failure- Creatinine 1.0 baseline and on admission.
Peak of 1.8 HD 6.
Serum Cr at time of discharge was at baseline.
Pulm nodule: CXR: 1.7 x 2.3 cm nodule in the RML with prior serial CTs in the past given history of MAC.
Chest CT ([**6-4**]) shows right lung opacity with right hilar lymphadenopathy and a new RUL 7 mm nodule.
