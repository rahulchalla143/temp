Labs showed WBC of 18.3 with 87.5 PMN's, HCT of 34, plt of 485.
Metabolic panel showed sodium of 130, chloride of 91, and BUN of 22, creatinine of 1.1, potassium of 4.4 and bicarbonate of 27.
ABG showed pH of 7.36 with pCO2 of 47 and pO2 on 74 on NRB.
Troponins were negative x 1.
CxR was performed which showed pulmonary edema with basilar opacity and likely atelectasis.
EKG showed Q waves in III as well as V1-3 with inverted TW in V1/V2...

The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-5-29**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
[**2126-7-17**] CT Chest w/o con: 1.
CXR shows pleural effusions but no lobar consolidations, and given that pt recently stopped diuretics, it was likely pt was fluid overloaded.
TTE showed moderate mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hyptertension (stable from prior).
Pt was diuresed with Lasix and given captopril for BP control but was discontinued after UOP decreased and creatinine increased.
Pt did well with antibiotic and her oxygen supplementation was weaned.
On hospital day 2 pt became oliguric and Cr bump to 1.3 and thus stopped captopril.
SBP in 130s and we restarted home atenolol.
# Hyponatremia: Pt's sodium remained low throughout MICU course and has a history of having diuretics changed due to hyponatremia.
Urine lytes, osm and urea were checked which showed low Na and osm consistent with dehyradation.
# Transitional Issues: - Needs renal ultrasound - Anemia workup  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
The chest x-ray and cat scan show that you have pneumonia as well as fluid in your lungs which is likely related to the pneumonia.
The cat scan showed two lesions in your kidneys which may be benign cysts, however your primary care doctor will need to do further workup for this.
