As pt seemed to improve clinically, with good oxygen saturation with 1-2L O2 by nasal cannula (usually 97-100% O2 sat on 1L NC), a taper of the steroids was begun.
2.  pneumonia - On admission, pt was on day [**1-28**] of broad spectrum antibiotics (ceftazidime, Flagyl, and vancomycin), with H flu the only reported organism growing from sputum cultures at the VA (never here).
The PICC line was pulled, and the tip sent for culture, which revealed coag negative Staph that was oxacillin resistant.
A Legionella urinary antigen was sent, which was negative.
Cardiac enzymes were sent, which revealed an elevated troponin thought to be most likely due to demand ischemia in setting of rapid a fib.
PICC infection was another possibility, though the PICC was removed and cultures showed coag negative Staph.
5.  aortic thrombus - Pt has an aortic thrombus, which is somewhat ulcerated.
It was recommended that pt get a repeat chest CT in one month, and if there is evidence of progression, he may need to follow up with cardiothoracic surgery as an outpatient for further management decisions.
Another ultrasound, performed 3 days after the first, showed a thrombosis in the L cephalic vein not previously seen.
9.  nutrition - nutrition was consulted, and pt was supplied with Boost shakes to supplement nutrition.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
Ceftazidime-Dextrose (Iso-osm) 1 g/50 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1) gram Intravenous  Q8H (every 8 hours): last day of course is [**2-13**].
