In the outside hospital Emergency Department, the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 23.0 with a troponin I of 8.55.
A diagnostic cardiac catheterization showed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for evaluation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 111/66, heart rate 88, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 97 percent on two liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - The pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Neck - jugular venous pressure is estimated at approximately ten centimeters.
Lungs - bibasilar crackles but otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The patient has two plus femoral dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and one plus posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
The patient's motor examination is significant for [**5-24**] muscle strength throughout all muscle groups except for five minus out of five strength in the left triceps, left hip flexors with mildly increased tone on the left.
The patient's deep tendon reflexes are symmetric though mildly decreased on the right.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 12.8, hematocrit 31.2, platelet count 202,000.
INR 1.4.
Sodium 144, potassium 4.5, chloride 107, bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 31, creatinine 1.1, glucose 92.
CK 44, troponin 3.44.
ALT 24, AST 31, alkaline phosphatase 51, total bilirubin 1.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Coronary artery disease - The patient was transferred from an outside hospital with three vessel coronary artery disease as demonstrated on a diagnostic cardiac catheterization performed prior to transfer.
The cardiac surgery consult service was consulted for possible coronary artery bypass graft and a preoperative workup was initiated.
The patient had no complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath throughout his hospitalization and his beta blocker and ace inhibitor were titrated up as tolerated by his heart rate and blood pressure.
The patient was evaluated with a viability study prior to discharge, the results of which are pending at the time of dictation.
Congestive heart failure - The patient was evaluated with an echocardiogram on admission which demonstrated an ejection fraction of less than 20 percent, moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
He was continued on the beta blocker and ace inhibitor, the doses of which were titrated up as tolerated by his blood pressure and heart rate.
As noted previously, the patient was evaluated with a viability study prior to discharge, the results of which are pending at the time of dictation.
Rhythm - The patient was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospitalization.
Gastrointestinal bleed - The patient was transferred from an outside hospital with a history of melena and hematocrit of 23.0 on initial presentation to the outside hospital.
Neurology - The neurology consult service was consulted for preoperative stroke clearance given the patient's history of a cerebrovascular accident.
A urine culture, TSH,Vitamin B12, folate and RPR were checked and noted to be normal.
The patient also had a MRI/MRA which showed no acute ischemic changes and was only significant for chronic small vessel disease with old lacunar infarcts.
As noted previously, his neurologic workup was negative.
Hematology - The patient's INR was noted to be elevated to 1.7 of an unclear etiology.
Liver function tests were checked and noted to be largely normal.
The patient's albumin was 3.3.
