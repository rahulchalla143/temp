In the ED, T 101.1, RR of 20, O2sat 88% on RA -> 99 % on 4L.
Exam notable for rales and poor air movement.
CXR consistent with RLL PNA and minimal CHF and started on levaquin for presumed CAP.
Transferred to MICU on HD #3 with increased rate of breathing.
Her ABG at that time was consistent with chronic CO2 retention (7.42/72/175 w/ HCO3 38 taken earlier in day).
Cervical myelopathy 12.
EMG [**2137-7-17**] showed chronic, generalized myopathy affecting upper greater than lower extremities as well as evidence for a mild, chronic, generalized axonal polyneuropathy affecting large diameter sensory fibers.
Physical Exam: T 98 HR 110s BP 98/60 RR 30 SaO2 100% on 4L GEN: lying in bed upright in respiratory distress, shallow breathing.
PULM: Bilateral crackles [**1-14**] way from bases, scattered exp wheezes.

CXR ([**2-21**]): Since most recent film, there is new opacification involving a large segment of the right lower lobe containing air bronchograms and probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is slight prominence to the right main pulmonary artery as noted on prior CT, which may be reflective of underlying pulmonary hypertension.
LENIs, bilateral ([**2-21**]): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
Prior studies - .
TTE ([**2137-8-18**]): EF>55% The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
# PNA: Hypoxic with RLL opacity on CXR at presentation.
Diagnostic sputum culture unable to be obtained.
ABG consistent with metabolic alkalosis and chronic respiratory acidosis without known prior h/o lung disease (no known COPD or smoking history).
However, the patient is s/p XRT for breast CA and has evidence of post-XRT changes by chest CT as well as a proximal myopathy of unknown significance and borderline NIF (max effort -24), raising a question of neuropathic or muscular contribution for which Neurology was consulted (see below).
Last ABG [**8-18**] which showed normal pCO2s.
Started on prednisone in MICU for wheezing on examination which has since resolved and will complete a short taper.
EMG ([**7-18**]) consistent with chronic, generalized myopathy.
ESR was 22, TSH normal at most recent check.
Continued coumadin initially but then held while supratherapeutic (goal INR [**2-15**]).
ECG without concerning changes.
# CHF: EF > 55%, diastolic dysfuction.
BNP 2563.
Prior iron studies c/w Anemia of chronic inflamation.
Hct remained stable.
Coumadin held, will need daily INR checks and await INR to trend down to < 3 before restarting at home dose.
# Hypertension: SBP 100's.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with cough productive of sputum and a rash of approximately 3 weeks in duration.
Your coumadin was held as your INR is elevated likely from the antibiotics.
You will need to have you INR level checked daily and coumadin restarted at your home dose when your INR [**2-15**].
