IMAGING [**2199-4-19**] CXR: Mild left base atelectasis, mild component of aspiration not excluded.
MICROBIOLOGY: -[**2199-4-19**] 11:05 PM urine culture: PROTEUS MIRABILIS.
-[**2199-4-19**] 2:30 pm urine culture:MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
-[**2199-4-22**] 5:43 pm urine culture: NO GROWTH.
-[**2199-4-23**] 8:53 pm urine culture: NO GROWTH.
Urine culture returned positive for Proteus sensitive to meropenem so the linezolid was stopped.
Final sensitivity showed pt's Proteus was sensitive to Ceftriaxone as well, so his antibiotic was changed from Meropenem to Ceftriaxone.
While on the medicine floor, pt spiked a fever and blood cultures and urine cultures were obtained.
One set of the urine cultures returned positive for staph aureus coag positive.
Pt was started on Vancomycin while the rest of the urine cultures were pending.
When the other urine cultures returned negative, pt was taken off the vancomycin since the staph aureus coag positive was likely due to skin contamination.
A repeat EKG in the AM had normalized.
A follow up ECHO was done, and it was positive for regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
His troponin was 0.05 and CKMB was 3 at that time.
EKG was repeated.
The decision was made to start medical management only as pt was asymptomatic and the troponin leak was not significant at this time and trending down.
# S/p Segmental Pulmonary Embolism in [**11/2198**] s/p IVC filter: INR was supratherapeutic at 4.3, so warfarin was initally held.
When INR was below 2, Coumadin was restarted.
At the time of discharge, pt's INR was only 1.3, so he was instructed to continue Lovenox treatment until his INR is between [**3-21**].
#Anemia: on admission pt's HCT was 38 and then trended down to 28.
Pt's stool was guiac negative and physical exam was negative for acute bleeding.

16. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: 0.5 Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): please do not take if blood pressure <100 or heart rate < 60.
Outpatient Lab Work please obtain INR level on [**4-27**] and on [**4-29**], and fax all results to anticoagulation lab ( Phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 74209**], Fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31021**]) and primary care physician (Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11962**], Fax: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6808**]).
#hx of segmental pulmonary embolism w/IVC filter ([**11-25**]): on admission your INR was elevated.
While your Coumadin was being titrated, we started you on Lovenox (this should be continued until your INR is [**3-21**]).INR labs will be obtained by the [**Month/Day (3) 269**] and they will send result to the anticoagulation nurses and your primary care physician.
You were seen by the Atrius cardiologists and had an ultrasound of your heart (ECHO).
#anemia: your hematocrit dropped from 38 on admission to 28.
Labs were followed and it was stable.
In summary, the following changes were made: -Stopped Gabapentin -Stopped Trazodone -Started IV Ceftriaxone -Started Lovenox -Started metoprolol -Started baby aspirin -[**Name2 (NI) **] Lisinopril -Started simvastatin   Followup Instructions: Name: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] L.
