A ChoICE PT XS wire was easily directed pst the occlusion and into what was felt to be the distal RCA.
After dottering with the 2.0 x 20 mm balloon and then dilating a  significant proximal stenosis with inflaitons of 12, 12, 10, and 10 ATM.
Final angioraphy revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent dissection, and normal flow.
Limited resting hemodynamice revealed moderately elevated left-sided filling pressures (LVEDP 20 mmHg).
Systemic areterial pressures were normal and there was no gradient noted on catheter pull back across the aortic valve.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent dissection and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
Final anigoraphy revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent  dissection, and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
ECHO: EF 40-45% The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Echo showed EF 40-45%, no akinesis or requirement for coumadin.
