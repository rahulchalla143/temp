CTA CHEST [**5-18**]: 1.
CT Head [**5-17**]: Stable appearance of brain, with right frontal, subinsular, and parietal infarcts; bifrontal and right temporal hemorrhagic contusions; mild subarachnoid, subdural, and intraventricular hemorrhage; and 3-mm rightward shift of the falx cerebri, with slight entrapment and dilation of the left lateral ventricle.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**5-16**]: Hemorrhagic contusions in the bifrontal and right temporal lobe.
MRA of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates patency of the proximal intracranial vasculature.
MRA of the neck demonstrates no significant stenosis.

[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] criteria, followup with dedicated chest CT can be performed at 12 months if patient has no risk factors for malignancy.
If patient has risk factors for malignancy, then dedicated chest CT is recommended in 6 to 12 months.
CT C-Spine 1.
CT head 1.
Carotid ultrasound [**5-11**] Impression: Right ICA <40% stenosis.
Echocardiogram [**5-11**] The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) global hypokinesis most prominent in the inferior and infero-lateral walls.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

An MRI showed right-sided large wedge-shaped infarcts, likely cardioembolic in etiology.
On general physical exam the morning of [**5-18**], the patient is afebrile, but is tachycardic to the low 100s with an irregularly irregular rhythm.
His lungs sound clear; however, there is a machine-like murmur to his heart that seems to encompass both the systolic and diastolic phases of the rhythm.
He is also somewhat tachypneic about 24 with peak respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute last night.
The exam findings of mild  weakness on the left and extinction to DSS fit with a medium-sized right parietal infarct.
Patient placed on heparin will montitor with CT in am of [**2161-5-19**] he was continued Keppra 500 [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis.
Lorazepam Intensol 2 mg/mL Concentrate Sig: 1-2 mg PO q2 hours as needed for anxiety.
