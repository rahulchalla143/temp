Her primary care physician did routine blood work on Thursday prior to admission with a hematocrit of 22.
Emergency medical services took the patient the morning of admission with substernal chest pain to [**Hospital3 **], electrocardiogram with ST elevations and she was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for catheterization.
Catheterization done revealed two vessel coronary artery disease, left circumflex was totally occluded in the mid segment but with collaterals to the right coronary artery.
Right heart catheterization showed a mean RA of 7, PA systolic of 46, mean wedge pressure of 28, cardiac output of 5.14.
Anemia with negative gastrointestinal workup and negative colonoscopy except for benign polyps, negative small bowel follow-through, negative barium enema, negative small bowel biopsy for sprue, per primary care physician.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature was 95.6, blood pressure 107/43, pulse 95, respiratory rate 22, saturations 99% on room air.
Weight 81.6 kg.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Moist mucous membranes, clear oropharynx.
Lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Abdomen, soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed white count 16.7 with 82% neutrophils, 2% bands, 7% lymphocytes.
Hematocrit 34.8, platelets 421.
Sodium 139, potassium 2.9, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, BUN 19, creatinine 1, glucose 217.
INR 1.3, albumin 4.5, creatinine kinase 68, troponin 0.02.
Electrocardiogram with normal sinus rhythm, normal intervals, normal axis, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in 1, 2, V5, V6, ST depressions in V2 and V3.
QRS of 130.
Catheterization as above.
Hemodynamics on catheterization showed increased wedge pressure.
ST elevation myocardial infarction - The patient with an inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction with CK peaked in the 1200 the morning after cardiac catheterization.
Otherwise the patient had an echocardiogram done for follow up which showed 30 to 35% ejection fraction, posterior lateral akinesis and 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient had lipid panel sent and liver function tests sent which were normal and the patient was started on 80 q. day of Atorvastatin.
The patient had a chest x-ray which was normal.
The patient had a follow up computerized tomography scan which results are still pending at the time of this discharge summary, but this can be followed up.
The patient also had one atypical blast cell on her complete blood count the morning after cardiac catheterization and myocardial infarction.
The patient had follow up differentials which did not show any further atypical cells.
The patient was seen by the Hematology Service and this can be continued to be followed as an outpatient, but as she had no further episodes, was attributed to acute inflammatory state after her myocardial infarction.
