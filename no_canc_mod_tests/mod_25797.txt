Selective angiography of this right dominant system revealed single (1) vessel coronary artery disease.
The LCX demonstrated only mild luminal irregularities.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and mildly elevated left filling pressures (RA mean 13; RVEDP 15; PCWP 19.
The cardiac output/index was 6.8/3.3 using the Fick method.
LV ventriculography was not performed.
Successful senting of the RCA with a 3.5 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent, which was post-dilated to 4.5 mm.
Final angiography showed no residual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
ST elevation inferior MI s/p cypher stenting proximal RCA: Pt had IMI enzymes trended down but had some residual ST elevation persisting post cypher stent placement in proximal RCA.
An ACE-I was not started at admission as her creatinine had been slightly increased and it was unclear whether or not there was a contraindication from past use.
Her PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and said that this could be started as her creatinine was stable at 1.1 and she did not have problems with this in the past.
She was started on lisinopril 5 mg po qday on the day of discharge and will have her electrolytes checked within the next few days by her PCP  or at rehab.
Her echocardiogram on the day before discharge showed low normal EF (50-55%), mild symmetric LVH, estimated pulmonary artery pressurewas normal, 1+ AR, trace MR. She will follow up with her new cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63953**] 2 weeks.
Her echocardiogram on day before discharge showed EF of 50-55%.
Platlets were 109 on day of discharge but there is no evidence of active bleeding.
She will have her hematocrit and platelets re-checked in the next few days along with her electrolytes and these will be followed by her PCP on an outpatient basis.
She will have her electrolytes checked in the next few days and will follow up with her PCP.
Her glucose was well controlled while in house with finger sticks 110's-140's.
You will need to have your blood electrolytes checked in the next 3 days while you are at rehab as you have been started on a new blood pressue medicine(lisinopril).
