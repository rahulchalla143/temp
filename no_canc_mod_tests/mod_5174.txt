His CT scan revelaed some inflamation around the pancreas as well as pseudocyst.

Had a few bouts of ventilator associated and aspiration pneumonia with proteus, klebsiella, Xanthomonas, yeast which are now controlled (please see ID section), had a number of bronchoscopy for evaluation and diagnosis.
growing GNR from sputum culture, treated with meropenem  Gastrointestinal: after admission patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with cyst gastrostomy, G, J and cholecystostomy tube placement, please see operative note for details.
On [**7-14**], Mr [**Known lastname **] was noted to have an rising WBC to 16.8, continued low-grade fevers, rigors, and tachycardic into 140s in atrial fibrillation with systolic BP dropping as low as 70.
Blood, peritoneal, central line, and sputum cultures were drawn.
Because the cholecystostomy tube had not drained throughout the day, a T-tube study was performed to evaluate the position of the cholecystostomy tube.
This study showed contrast extravasation from the indwelling cholecystostomy tube near its insertion.
where a cholecystectomy, abdominal washout, replacement of the G-tube, left tube thoracostomy, and liver biopsy were all performed.
On [**7-15**], given his rising Tbili to 4.9, an ERCP was performed and a biliary stent was successfully placed in the common bile duct.
follow up ERCP and EGD showed satisfactory position of the biliary drain [**2207-9-14**] patient again developed increase of the G-tube output with feculent looking material, evidence of aspiration with succus from the ET tube suctioned,respiratory distress, septic physiology.
patient had G-tube study which showed that G-tube eroded into the transverse colon.
Bowel sounds present, normal BM on bowel regiment  Liver: patient's liver showed evidence of steatosis for which hepatology and biliary surgery service consult and biopsy was obtained.
There was a suspicion of portal hypertension, causing persistent ascites (s/p paracentesis x3), however portal vein pressure studies showed normal pressures.
his liver enzymes normalized, patient is stable and does not require further interventions  Renal/Urology: through out patient admission, patient renal function remained stable, Patient required multiple doses of Lasix and Diamox to help with perioperative diuresis and heart failure.
He does remain very sensitive to dehydration with prompt decrease in urine output as well and increase in BUN.
His blood glucose remains in 100-140 range.
His hematocrit remains low but stable.
his peritoneal washings grew yeast, Enterobacter.
Infectious disease service followed patient for some time Now: G and J tubes are clean, with no evidence of erythema or cellulitis, his he has some secretions requiring ET suctioning, the most recent culture ([**10-12**]) is growing Xanthomonas.
His electrolytes are in good control  Activity: patient has been actively working with physical and occupational therapy services, with slow but steady improvement.
