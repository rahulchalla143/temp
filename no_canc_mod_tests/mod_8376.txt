In the Emergency Room, the patient's blood pressure was 78/40 and rectal revealed melena.
Hematocrit on admission was 17.3.
The patient received 800 cc of intravenous fluids and 3 units of packed red blood cells with an increase in blood pressure to 110/60.
Of note, the patient's baseline systolic blood pressure is 80 to 90.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
Status post     cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the left     anterior descending, [**2175**], complicated by apical thrombus     requiring emergent coronary artery bypass graft.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10     to 15%, severe left ventricular dilatation, global     hypokinesis starting at the base, known apical aneurysm.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of     1.4.
Colonoscopy in [**2176-3-19**], showed     diverticulosis with a single polyp at 12 cm.
EGD in     [**2176-6-19**], showed AVM's in the third part of the     duodenum.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, afebrile, blood pressure 100/40; heart rate 80 and paced; respiratory rate 14; O2 saturation 100% on room air.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular: Diffuse point of maximum impulse, positive S4, regular rate, III/VI systolic murmur heard best at the base.
LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 6.2, hematocrit 17.3, platelets 155,000, INR 1.2, creatinine 2.3, BUN 133, glucose 159.
CPK 57, digoxin 2.0.
Hematocrit at the day of discharge, 31.6.
RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Repeat chest x-ray [**2176-10-20**], showed massive cardiomegaly with left ventricular predominance.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 72 year old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 10 to 15%.
The patient's hematocrit on admission was 17.3.
The patient denied any abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting at the time of admission but did complain of back pain which is anginal equivalent and was [**Year (4 digits) 20003**] out by myocardial infarction by serial cardiac enzymes.
During this hospitalization, the patient underwent EGD on [**2176-10-8**], and [**2176-10-21**].
First EGD showed a small hiatal hernia and lots of coffee ground blood in the stomach and three AVM's in the stomach fundus which were cauterized.
On hospital day number two, the patient's sodium started to increase as the patient had been diuresing spontaneously and was NPO for several days.
On hospital day number four, sodium increased to 152 and D5W rate was increased with no evidence of congestive heart failure on examination or chest x-ray despite ejection fraction of 10 to 15% and multiple packed red blood cell transfusions.
Urine sodium initially was 26 which decreased to less than 10 approximately two days later.
The patient's serum sodium eventually decreased to 147 and D5W was discontinued.
The patient had a continual low hematocrit of approximately 25 despite 10 to 15 units of packed red blood cells.
On [**2176-10-21**], the patient underwent a second EGD with further exploration into the distal duodenum.
Since second EGD the patient was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells with stable hematocrit of 30.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable at 30 in the 48 hours prior to discharge.
The patient received a large amount of intravenous fluids with a decrease in creatinine to baseline at the time of discharge.
