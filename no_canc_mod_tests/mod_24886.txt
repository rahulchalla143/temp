He was in his usual state of health - living in an [**Hospital 4382**] facility and taking budesonide, xopenex, and ipratropium nebulizers once a day with baseline congestion and sputum production - until one week prior to admission, when he began to experience increased congestion, increased frequency of cough, and increased sputum production.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation and ST depression v3-6.
He received ASA 325 and had cardiac enzymes drawn.
A CXR was done which showed RML and RLL infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia.
INR was 5.5.
He had blood cultures drawn, received 1.5L NS, levofloxacin, acetaminophen, tramadol, and  ipratropium nebulizers.
He had a brief episode of hypotension with SBP 89 while in the ED; this responded rapidly to fluids.
CHF 5.
Osteoarthritis 9.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.5, BP 118/62, HR 102, RR 18, O2sat 94% on 1L .
CV: Irregularly irregular, distant heart sounds [**2-16**] hyperinflation, systolic murmur best heard at LSB radiating to apex.
Resp: Crackles heard at R lung base and R axilla, w/ dullness to percussion and egophany.
Point tenderness along ~10th rib, right midaxillary line.
Cranial nerves II-XII intact, Strength 5/5 throughout, preserved sensation to light touch in both feet.
CK: 138  MB: 5  Trop-T: 0.02 .
PT: 50.2  PTT: 43.4  INR: 5.5 .
MICROBIOLOGY: [**2-8**] BCx - NTD.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2112-2-11**]):       MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH FECAL       CONTAMINATION.
[**2-10**] Urine Legionella Ag negative .
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2112-2-10**]):       >25 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper respiratory       secretions.
Bacterial culture results are invalid.
[**2-10**], [**2-11**] Blood Cx - NTD .
STUDIES: EKG - showed STD v3-6, afib with HR ~100.
[**2-8**] CXR - Right middle lobe pneumonia.
[**2-10**] TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
[**2-10**] CXR - Findings are very concerning for right lung pneumonia but asymmetric CHF is a possibility.
[**2-11**] CXR - There is interval improvement in the right upper lobe opacity compared to the prior study consistent with interval resolving aspiration.
Bibasal opacities are still present, right more than left, and may represent gradually resolving areas of infection.
Brief Hospital Course: 79yoM with COPD, CHF, AVR/MVR on Coumadin, ?afib presenting with productive cough and infiltrate on CXR suggestive of right middle lobe pneumonia.
However, the patient's oxygen saturation then decreased to the 80's on 4L NC and he was changed to a non-rebreather and sent to the MICU for respiratory distress.
TTE was done and showed preserved systolic function.
Cardiology assessed the pt in the ED and felt ST depressions in precordial leads on EKG were demand ischemia.
Coumadin was held for supratherapeutic INR (see below) and patient was placed on home Verapamil.
# CAD s/p CABG:  Home Coumadin was initially held in the setting of INR 5.5, which rose to 9.8 the following day off Coumadin on antibiotics, and Vitamin K 5mg po x1 was given.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral Pneumonia Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbation  Secondary Diagnosis: - Atrial fibrillation - Coronary Artery Disease - Chronic Congestive Heart Failure (Diastolic) - Prostate CA s/p chemotherapy and XRray Therapy, with chronic foley - Hypothyroidism - Back pain [**2-16**] spinal stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital for a cough and right sided chest wall pain.
