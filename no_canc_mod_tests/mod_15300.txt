Exam revealed a MR murmur and blood cultures were positive for group B streptococcus.
TTE at [**Hospital1 18**] indicated a probably mitral valve vegetation, however, a TEE could not be performed due to obstruction in the hypopharynx preventing passage of scope.
Surveillance cultures performed from admission through HD3 were negative to date at the time of discharge.
INR was followed daily and warfarin was dosed as necessary to keep patient therapeutic.
INR on the day of discharge was 2.1.
#Diastolic congestive heart failure:  Patient had no signs of fluid overload on exam at the time of admission.
TTE showed normal biventricular global systolic function.
On HD5, patient had a bladder scan which revealed 1L of retained urine.
Exam was consistent with a gouty flare.
Chronic Issues: # Hypothyroidism: Patient was continued on home levothyroxine throughout admission  # CKD stage III baseline Cr 1.5 to 1.6: Pts creatinine was lower than baseline at the time of admission (1.0).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Group B Strep Endocarditis Second degree Heart block s/p pacemaker Chronic Diastolic congestive heart failure Acute Urinary Retention Acute Kidney Injury Atrial Fibrillation on Warfarin   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You will need to see a cardiologist after the antibiotics are done to see if you will need a permanant pacemaker and to check another echocardiogram to see if the infection is done in the valve.
