Underwent NG lavage which came back bilious with no blood or clots.
GI team saw him afterward in ED but did not feel comfortable sending patient for tagged RBC scan in setting of slightly unstable vital signs.

Will need repeat colonoscopy in the future to remove polyps.
The polyps were not removed given recent bleed and the patient will need another colonoscopy for removal as an outpatient.
# Hyperkalemia: Patient has had this in the past in the setting of ARF; on admission, his creatinine was slightly elevated which likely contributed to hyperkalemia.
There were no associated EKG changes and the K trended down through the course of his ICU stay.
# Acute Renal Failure: His baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 over the last 2 years and on admission his creatinine was high-normal for him at 1.3.
His medications were renally dosed and the creatinine trended down during the course of his ICU stay after transfusion.
As he had a syncopal event in the ED, which was thought likely vasovagal in setting of BRBPR, cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out cardiac event.
EKG remained unchanged although on telemetry patient noted to have intermittent LBBB.
It was thought likely this LBBB was related to age-related degeneration of the cardiac conduction system and less likely ACS so no further workup was pursued.
Repeat EKG showed persistent LBBB, not rate related.
We performed a CAT scan of your abdomen and a colonoscopy, and found that you have a condition called "diverticulosis".
We also discovered that your blood sugar levels are slightly elevated, which indicates that you may have a condition called "diabetes".
