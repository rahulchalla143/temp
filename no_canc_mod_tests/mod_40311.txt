She also had upper airway stridor with coarse hoarseness; CT chest revealed 5mm tracheal opening c/w stenosis with potential tracheal fracture.

TTE [**8-4**]: MPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid LAD distribution).
CTA chest [**8-2**]: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary embolus.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: This is a 39 year old female with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2200-7-8**] c/b cardiogenic shock with IABP, EF 30%, possible Dressler's syndrome, pneumonia, and tracheal stenosis who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of tracheal stenosis.
Bronchoscopy revealed mucoid concretions obstructing 95% of the tracheal lumen.
Tracheitis: Pt had a rigid bronchoscopy which revealed mucoid concretions that were obstructing the tracheal lumen, as well as plaques on the wall of the trachea that were seen under the mucus.
Tissue biopsy and bronchial washings were sent which revealed commensal bacterial flora as well as diphtheroids and enterococcus.
Fungal cx were still pending at time of discharge.
Blood cultures were negative.
CT also demonstrated nodal mass believed to be related to her infection.
But the time course seemed too short for Dressler's (usually presents weeks after MI, though some present within a week) and ECG was without evidence of pericarditis.
Repeat ECHO showed no evidence of effusion.
CTA was negative for PE.
EKG consistent with recent anterior MI.
Her aspirin, plavix, and metoprolol were continued.
She was monitored on telemetry which revealed no abnormalities.
Acute systolic CHF: Had acute systolic CHF (EF of 20%) from MI at OSH.
Repeat ECHO at [**Hospital1 18**] showed normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction, right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation, increased PCWP, and pulmonary artery hypertension.
EF was 35-40%.
Glucose was elevated during admission.
TRANSITION ISSUES # Chest pain, likely [**1-1**] sternotomy: 6 day course of PO Oxycontin 20mg q12 and PO dilaudid 2mg q6 prn with follow-up with PCP to determine further pain management.
You will also need to follow-up with the pulmonary doctors for a repeat scope of your throat.
Your blood pressure was also low while you were admitted so we did not give you your lisinopril.
