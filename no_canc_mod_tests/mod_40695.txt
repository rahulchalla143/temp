Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2118-6-17**]):    NO GROWTH.
EKG [**6-8**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2117-4-19**] there is no change.
Echo [**6-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-3-21**], the gradient across the aortic valve is higher.
TEE [**6-10**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT Chest: CT OF THE CHEST: Bilateral peripheral solid nodules with ground-glass halos are noted scattered throughout the lungs, the largest in the left upper lobe, measures 13 x 9 mm.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver and gallbladder appear unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The bladder, distal ureters, rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**6-8**]: FINDINGS: Examination is limited due to artifact from motion.
There is pulsation artifact in the prepontine cistern (image 111, series 8, image 61, series 800A).
He had a TTE and TEE, both which showed no evidence of vegetations/infection in the heart.
A CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis with contrast was obatined which showed the septic emboli, but no evidence of abdominal symptoms.
He was set up with follow-up appointments with his PCP and with ID and instructions for his VNA to draw surveillance labs were provided.
An EKG was checked and was unchanged from prior and showed no ST-T wave changes.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw a CBC on [**6-21**].
You were admitted with bilateral lung nodules in your lungs that were suspicious for bacterial emboli.
You had an echocardiogram that showed no infection in the heart and a CT scan that showed no infection in the abdomen.
You will need to have labs drawn by the VNA during your treatment.
You will need a CBC (Complete Blood Count) drawn next week, on [**6-21**].
