CXR was unchanged from prior CXR last month.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.5 BP 132/78 P 102 RR 18 O2sat 98% 4LNC.
BP was noted to drift down to SBP 90s, so the patient was given 2LNS.
CXR showed bilateral patchy interstitial opacification of the lower lobes.
Vitals on transfer: P 92 BP 101/68 RR 18 O2sat 100%4LNC.
SOB had improved and BP stabilized in the 120s-130s.
Although his saturations held in the low 90s he was increasing tachypneic and tachycardic.
Given gradual decline in respiratory function (6-8 weeks), this appears to be a more chronic process that is acutely worsened by evolving PNA within the LLL and GNR in sputum.
