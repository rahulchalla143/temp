Prenatal screens were as follows: Blood group A positive, direct antibody test negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, group B streptococcus colonization negative.
Apgars were 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes.
This evening the infant was noted to have approximately 3 cc of bilious emesis and was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.
Urine output has qualitatively low and uric acid crystals have been noted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination reveals a term infant in no distress.
Heart rate is 155, respiratory rate 40 to 50, blood pressure 85/52 with mean of 62, oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.
Suck, root and gag reflexes are intact.
Grasp reflex is symmetrical.
MSK: Examination of the spine, limbs, hips and clavicles is within normal limits.
INVESTIGATIONS:  Abdominal x-ray shows markedly dilated loops of some stool filled loops but no pneumatosis and no free intraperitoneal air.
We will check serum electrolytes and glucose given the history of poor feeding and uric acid crystals.
Infectious Disease - We will draw a CBC and blood culture.
If these are abnormal or if gastrointestinal studies fail to reveal an anatomic cause of obstruction, we will start broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for an anticipated duration of 48 hours pending culture results and clinical course.
There are no current neurological issues and the examination is within normal limits.
Cardiovascular - The infant has been hemodynamically stable all throughout his course and the cardiovascular examination is within normal limits.
DISPOSITION:  The infant is to be transferred to [**Hospital3 18242**] for GI contrast investigations and possible surgical correction if an anatomical obstruction is noted.
