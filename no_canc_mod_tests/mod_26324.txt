PRENATAL SCREENS:  Blood type B positive, antibody negative, RPR nonreactive, group beta strep negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and rubella immune.
The initial ultrasound showed ventriculomegaly and a porencephalic cyst.
Subsequent prenatal MRI showed the following: 1.
Apgar scores were 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes of age.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Birth weight 2370 grams (25th percentile), head circumference 33.5 cm (50th to 75th percentile), length 45.5 cm (25th to 50th percentile).
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT: Anterior fontanel slightly full, posteriorly fontanel prominent, sagittal sutures split approximately 1 cm, nondysmorphic, palate is intact, no nasal flaring.
Initial blood glucose was 55.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY:  The infant was admitted from labor and delivery to the newborn intensive care unit for evaluation of this infant with prenatal diagnosis of porencephalic cyst.
He returned to the newborn intensive care unit on [**12-9**] for head imaging studies.
His blood pressure has been normal throughout his hospitalization.
Heart rate is 120s to 160s and no murmurs auscultated.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: Enteral feeds were initiated within 24 hours of age.
His weight at the time of discharge is 2285 grams, and head circumference 33 cm.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The infant's bilirubin on day of life 3 was 5.3 with direct bilirubin of 0.3.
HEMATOLOGY: The infant's blood type is not known at this time.
His hematocrit upon admission to the newborn intensive care unit was 53.6.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: CBC was drawn upon admission to the NICU mainly to look at the infant's platelet count which was 195.
The infant's CBC had white count of 8.7, hematocrit of 53.6 with 51% poly's and 2% bands.
Blood culture was not drawn at that time and he has not received any antibiotics.
NEUROLOGY: As mentioned before the infant was readmitted to the NICU on [**12-9**] for head imaging studies.
He underwent a head ultrasound on [**12-9**] which showed: 1) porencephaly, 2) hypoplastic or absent corpus callosum, 3) debris and/or blood products layering within the dependent portion of the left lateral ventricle.
An MRI was done over at [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**12-10**] which showed dysmorphic cystic dilatation of the left lateral ventricle consistent with porencephaly.
The infant's neurologic examination has remained normal.
SENSORY: A hearing screen was performed without automated auditory brain stem responses.
OPHTHALMOLOGY: Eye examination not indicated for this 36 and [**3-28**] week infant.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] social work has been involved with the family.
Car seat position screening: I attempted to do car seat     test in a car seat that was provided by social services     at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Car seat was     found to be too big for the infant, so car seat position     screening deferred.
