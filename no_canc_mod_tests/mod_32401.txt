She was administered 40mg IV lasix x 1 with 1L urine output and was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
After her fall, she gradually developed lower extremity paralysis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
MRI demonstrated T11-T12 cord compression and she was taken for T8-L2 posterior spinal fusion with T11 laminectomy.
Upon arrival in the ED, vital signs were temp 95.1, HR 90s, BP 93/76, RR 30s, and Pulse ox 100% 4L.
Labs were notable for creatinine of 1.2 (baseline 1-1.2), potassium 5.7, troponin elevated to .08, and BNP elevated to 8506.
INR was therapeutic to 2.3.
ECG was notable for atrial fibrillation with no acute ST changes.
CXR was also remarkable for left pleural effusion that has increased in size and a moderate right sided pleural effusion as well.

[**2101-11-7**] CXR 1.
[**2101-12-9**] CXR  Increasing large left-sided pleural effusion could be secondary to change in position of left upper quadrant pigtail catheter  [**2101-12-13**] CXR  In comparison with study of [**12-12**], there is removal of the left chest tube.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2101-12-7**] poor R wave progression is not seen on the current tracing and there are more ventricular premature beats.

The pleural fluid was a transudate by Light's criteria and the gram stain and culture were negative.
She had episodes of dyspnea with exertion when being moved in bed but consistently kept an oxygen saturation >90% and was never tachypneic.
She was aggressively diuresed because of anasarca, likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia and IVF administration during her prior admission while on the surgical service, and was negaative three to five liters each day for the first five days after being transferred to the floor.
She continued to reaccumulate fluid in the left pleural space when the tube became clogged multiple times and her L CT was changed after CT chest showed that it was adherent to the pericardium.
The new CT drained a large amount of fluid immediately and then the drainage decreased significantly, the tube was pulled three days later and the fluid did not reaccumlate.
# Anasarca:  The patient was severely volume overloaded, likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia and IVF administration during her prior admission while on the surgical service, and was diuresed aggressively with marked improvement, as described above.
Because she has an IVC filter in place (placed during her prior hospitalization because anticoagulation was contraindicated in the setting of an epidural hematoma), she was not initially bridged with heparin when her INR fell below 2 because she was awaiting chest tube placement.
After chest tubes were placed bilaterally, a heparin gtt was started and continued until her INR was greater than 2.
# UTI:  The patient had a urine culture that grew E. coli sensitive to bactrim, gentamicin, and zosyn.
Her metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] because she continued to have HR around 100, and she was also monitored on telemetry.
