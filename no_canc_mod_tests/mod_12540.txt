The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 14430**] on [**11-7**] with a BPP of [**2-26**].
No formal evaluation of the etiology of the growth restriction was done.
The maternal screens were blood type of O negative, antibody negative, Hepatitis B surface antigen was negative.
RPR was nonreactive.
In the Delivery Room, the patient emerged with decreased tone, respirations and heart rate.
The head circumference was 23 cm which was also the 5th percentile.
Cardiac examination had a regular rate and rhythm without murmur.
The neurologic examination was nonfocal and appropriate for age.
The ventilator settings have ranged from positive inspiratory pressures of 22 to 30 over peak end-expiratory pressures of 5 to 7 with rates from 23 to 28.
As of [**1-16**], the current ventilator settings were 28/7 with a rate of 28.
The PICC line came from below and had no access to the chest cavity itself and the IVC was below the diaphragm, however, the fluid that was tapped from the right and drained from the left with a chest tube on [**11-23**], was consistent with parenteral nutrition.
The patient was fluid restricted further from initially total fluids of 140 in [**Month (only) 404**] down to today's 130 cc per kilo per day and in addition to the Diuril, Lasix was given on an every-other-day basis on [**12-28**] for a total of six days with slight improvement in ventilation, at which time the Lasix was discontinued and Aldactone was started in an effort to get the potassium sparing effect.
Currently, [**Known lastname 5621**] [**Known lastname 37227**] is on ventilator settings of 28/7 with a rate of 28, remains on Diuril, Aldactone, and dexamethasone for his chronic lung disease management as well as fluid restrictions.
The patient, at that point, was already NPO and did get a course of Indomethacin at which point the follow-up echocardiogram on [**11-12**] showed that the PDA had closed.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was initially NPO, was started on D10 and then advanced to parenteral nutrition due to concerns of sepsis in addition to PDA and courses of Indomethacin.
The patient was started on potassium and phosphorus on [**12-27**], due to a low phosphate of 3.4.
Current medications for Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Include sodium and potassium supplementations; the potassium supplementations are in the form of chloride as well as phosphate.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had the initial problems with sepsis which I will detail in the next subsection as well as being PN dependent for the first three to four weeks of life and has subsequently had a rise in his both total and direct bilirubin as well as his liver function tests.
On [**1-1**], the ALT reached 238; the AST was 323 and alkaline phosphatase was 830 with a total bilirubin of 12 and a direct bilirubin of 9.
Repeat liver function tests and bilirubin on [**1-8**], showed an ALT of 167, an AST of 185, a total bilirubin of 8.5 and a direct of 6.5.
However, over the course of the next week, these values tended to trend back up and on [**1-15**], the total bilirubin reached 9.8 with a direct of 7.6 and a phosphorus of 4.4, at which time the GI Service was consulted.
The HIDA scan will be performed on [**2103-1-17**].
On [**2102-12-28**], after several days of increasing amounts of trachea aspirate and a color change from white to tan, a trachea aspirate culture was sent which showed moderate beta Strep as well as [**Known lastname 37228**] and antibiotics at that time were started.
A lumbar puncture obtained at that time was benign and was felt to be an isolated respiratory infection.
The repeat culture from the tracheal aspirate was sent on antibiotic day nine with continued presence of [**Known lastname 37228**].
OPHTHALMOLOGY FINDING:  The first eye examination on [**12-20**] showed a Stage I, Zone I, with two clock hours bilaterally.
On [**12-26**], the follow-up eye examination again showed Stage I, Zone 2 this time, with four clock hours bilaterally.
[**1-3**], again the examination was stable; it showed Stage I, Zone 2, four clock hours and the patient is due for a repeat eye examination on [**1-17**].
