Blood cultures were positive for MSSA.

[**2140-3-10**] Cardiac Catheterization: Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no significant epicardial CAD.
The LMCA, LAD, LCX, RCA and their branches had no angiographically apparent disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial central normotension.
Supraaortic aortography revealed severe AI.
CHEST (PA & LAT)[**2140-3-16**] Reason: evaluate pleural effusions [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 25 year old man s/p avr, asc ao replacement REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate pleural effusions STUDY: PA and lateral chest, [**2140-3-19**].
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the previous study from [**3-19**], [**2140**] and [**2140-3-5**].
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2140-3-15**] PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Intraoperative TEE for Re-do Bental Procedure Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2140-3-15**] at 13:55 Test: TEE (Complete) Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler Contrast: None Tape Number: 2007AW1-: Test Location: Anesthesia West OR cardiac Technical Quality: Adequate REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**] MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.0 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: *9.2 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 20% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Ascending: 2.8 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aorta - Descending Thoracic: 2.3 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm) INTERPRETATION: Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: All four pulmonary veins identified and enter the left atrium.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D  images.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior  - hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal -  hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal inferior - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex - hypo; apex - hypo; RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.
Aortic valve vegetation/mass cannot be excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
An aortic valve vegetation/mass cannot be excluded.
LV systolic function remains severely globally depressed.
Brain MRI/MRA imaging was obtained which showed no acute infarct or evidence of mycotic aneurysm.
Blood cultures were also taken which remained negative.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was also obtained which confirmed severe aortic insufficiency.
Right ventriclular systolic function was likely depressed but hard to evaluate given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation which was [**2-9**]+.
Given these new findings, surgery was postponed and additional evaluation was performed, including potential cardiac transplantation.
Cardiac catheterization was obtained to exclude a possibility of a coronary embolus.
Angiography showed normal coronary arteries.
He was transfused with packed red blood cells to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
Wafarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5 given his mechanical aortic valve.
He spiked a fever on postoperative day four for which pan cultures were obtained and empiric antibiotics were given.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: 2.5 Tablets PO once a day: please take 12.5 mg [**3-27**] and [**3-28**] and have INR checked [**3-29**] for further dosing.
Goal INR 2.5-3.0 for AVR   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Recurrent Endocarditis, Aortic Root Abscess, Severe Aortic Insufficiency, Congestive Heart Failue, Intravenous Drug Abuser, Prior Homograft Root Replacement and VSD Closure in [**2137**], History of Septic Emboli to Spleen, Kidney and Cerebrum, History of Bicuspid Aortic Valve - s/p Aortic Valvuloplasty at age 15   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Patient may shower, no baths.
