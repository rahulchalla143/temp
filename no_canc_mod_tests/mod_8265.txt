The neurologist in the ED left a consultant note in his chart, the pertinents of which are as follows: - He was not "responsive" to 1g of IV keppra - He was noted on exam to have a right sided spastic posturing of the upper extremity, constant opsoclonus, no spontaneous movements or myoclonus, occasional roving eye movements, as well as an upgoing toe on the left.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for continuous EEG monitoring to rule out NCSE.
His wife reports that his urine has been dark lately.

Sensitivity testing performed by Sensititre.
Radiology: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2106-11-5**] 7:53 PM FINDINGS: Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2106-11-5**] 7:58 PM FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, midline shift, acute mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2106-11-7**] 4:38 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-5**], there are bibasilar opacifications, more prominent on the right, that appear to be mildly increased.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2106-11-9**] 3:59 AM MPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-7**] and 28:  A largely dependent pulmonary edema is mild to moderate, but increased since [**11-8**].
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2106-2-5**] ventricular bigeminy is not present on the current tracing.
EEG	Study Date of [**2106-11-6**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of diffuse background slowing more apparent in the first few hours of recording indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
EEG	Study Date of [**2106-11-7**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of diffuse background slowing indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
EEG	Study Date of [**2106-11-8**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of diffuse background slowing indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of possible status epilepticus.
He was found to have a UTI on U/A which later grew enterococcus and was started on IV Ceftriaxone.
He was also found to have right greater than left bibasal opacities on CXR in keeping with  possible aspiration pneumonia.
CT head revealed extensive hypodensities in the bilateral MCA distributions in keeping with his old infarcts in addition to a hypodensity in the left cerebellum also likely from prior infract.
He went on to have an MRI which revealed no acute infarct.
His carbamazepine levels were high and this improved after reducing his dose from 800mg [**Hospital1 **] to 600mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was monitored on EEG telemetry from [**Date range (1) 35176**] and although this showed slowing in keeping with previous sizeable bilateral MCA infarcts in addition to semi-rhythmic sharp waves in the left central parietal region in keeping with a seizure focus but there were no seizures present either clinically or electrographically.
He will have carbamzepine levels checked on [**11-16**] prior to his neurology appointment.
Medications on Admission: Atenolol 25mg daily Citalopram 30mg daily Tegretol XR 800mg [**Hospital1 **] Lamictal 200mg [**Hospital1 **] - per neurologist 400mg [**Hospital1 **] Simvastatin 20mg QHS ASA 81mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check carbamazepine level on [**2106-11-16**] and fax to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 35173**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35177**] Tel [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35178**].
The blood level of your Tegretol was high and we reduced your dose to 600mg twice daily.
Medication changes: We STARTED Keppra 1000mg twice daily We DECREASED Carbamazepine (Tegretol) to 600mg twice daily We STARTED augmentin 500mg three time sdaily which you should take until the end of [**2106-11-14**] We STARTED laxatives Please continue your other medications as prescribed  Followup Instructions: Please see your PCP within the next 1-2 weeks following discharge You should check labs on [**2106-11-16**] for anti-seizure drug levels prior to your neurology appointment.
