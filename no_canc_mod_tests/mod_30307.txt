TRACING #4  ECG [**8-19**]  Atrial fibrillation.
[**8-17**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2098-9-22**], the left ventricular cavity is now dilated with an aneurysmal apex and more depressed global systolic function.
The estimated PA systolic pressure may be slightly higher.
CXR [**8-17**] FINDINGS: Comparison to radiographs dated [**2107-3-18**] indicates a new small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe consolidation.
# Chest Pain - Given her EKG ST elevations in V1-V4 the patient experienced a anterior STEMI which was treated with emergent cardiac catherization and LAD stent placements.
The presence of apical and anterior hypokinesis on an echocardiogram in [**2098**], it is possible the patient had chronic decreased flow to the LAD terriotory.
We gently diuresed her with 40mg-80mg IV Lasix boluses and observed I's and O's- she exhibited adequate responses daily with good urine output between 0.5-1.5L negative daily.
A CXR [**8-17**] AM showed interim development of left pleural effusion and possible left lower lobe consolidation.
# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure- The patient's last echocardiogram was in [**2098**] when she had a EF on 30-35 % and anterior/apical regional wall hypokinesis.
Started 5mg Coumadin daily which will  provide thrombus prophylaxis given her apical hypokinesis and apical aneurysm.Followup echocardiogram showed left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2098-9-22**], the left ventricular cavity is now dilated with an aneurysmal apex and more depressed global systolic function.
The estimated PA systolic pressure may be slightly higher.Continued plavix and aspirin 325 mg daily.
Also could be due to hypoperfusion given her diminished cardiac output according to echo which is most probably chronic , however could have worsened given her recent ischemic event.
Trended her Creatinine which has been increasing and now is stable at 1.6 from 1.1 on admission.
#Atrial Fibrilliation - Chronic which has been rate controlled with lopressor but no warfarin given patient's past hx.
The left lesser saphenous vein shows reflux with diameters ranging from 0.3 to0.7 and is greater than 1.2 cm from the skin surface.Encouraged patient to elevate lower extremities.
Medications on Admission: AMLODIPINE - 10 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day ASPIRIN - 81 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day FLUTICASONE - 50 mcg Spray, Suspension - 1 spray nasally in each nostril once a day FUROSEMIDE - 20 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day as needed for for excessive swelling of legs GLIPIZIDE - 10 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day INSULIN GLARGINE [LANTUS] - 100 unit/mL Solution - 24 u q hs at bedtime IRBESARTAN [AVAPRO] - 300 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day LEVOTHYROXINE [LEVOTHROID] - 125 mcg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day METFORMIN - 500 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day METOPROLOL SUCCINATE - 100 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day NYSTATIN-TRIAMCINOLONE - 100,000 unit/gram-0.1 % Cream - apply to rash topically twice a day.
Dispense 30 gram tube Do not use longer than 2 weeks Gabapentin 300mg bedtime  Medications - OTC BLOOD SUGAR DIAGNOSTIC [ONE TOUCH ULTRA TEST] -   Strip - test blood sugars 2-3 times a day CALTRATE [**Telephone/Fax (3) 98780**]-25 mg-unit-mg Tablet - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day MULTIVITAMIN-MINERALS-LUTEIN [CENTRUM SILVER] -   Tablet - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day VITAMIN A-VITAMIN C-VIT E-MIN [OCUVITE] -   Tablet - 2 (Two) Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day .
Following the procedure, your kidney function deteriorated mildly due to the combination of the dye you received during your procedure and the results of diuretic medications to reduce the accumulation of water in the lungs.
You were stable following your procedure and we increased the amount of diuretic we gave you to improve your oxygen levels and shortness of breath.
You had an ultrasound scan of your heart which showed a dilated area at the top of the heart which is suggestive taht you may have had a previous small heart attack in this same area that had been unnoticed.
4) You will need to have your kidney function tests checked to make sure they are heading in tehright direction 5) With your new blood pressure medications, you will need to have your blood pressure checked regularly 6) your Foley catheter was removed on [**8-20**], you may have difficulty passing urine after this and this may have to be replaced if you are unable to pass urine  You should weigh yourself daily and see your PCP if your weight changes by >3lb.
Before you left, your weight was 106.2 Kg (234.1 Lb) if it increases by more than 3 lb , you should consult your doctor.
