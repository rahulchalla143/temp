She initially presented to OSH, where CT torso and C-spine was completed which was notable for L1 burst fracture, but no evidence for pulmonary or abdominal infection or hemorrhage.
At the OSH, she was afebrile, but hypotensive with SBP 70s unresponsive to fluid rescusitation (2L given at OSH (at 0919 and 1018) and was started on dopamine at 1258.
She was started on vancomycin and cefepime at 1pm on [**2181-9-21**](uncertain whether cultures were drawn).
Labs were notable for leukocytosis 17, HCT 30.5, HCO3 20, normal liver enzymes and synthetic function, and cortisol (pending).
Guaiac exam was negative.
She received a FAST ultrasound which was negative and bedside echocardiogram did not reveal a pericardial effusion.
She received a right IJ and was started initially on dopamine and then transitioned to levophed for blood pressure support.
Total 3L NS given (2L at OSH and 1L in ED).
Access CVL and 2 peripherals.
A CT scan apparently revealed cirrhosis and varices that were also (apparently) seen on ultrasound.
She was dischrged on Folic/B12/B1, Norvasc 5, Lisinopril 20, Corgard 20, Protonix 40, K 20, lisinopril 20.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Her Lisinopril, Nadolol, lasix and aldactone were held.
Pt had an TTE, which did not show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, or ongoing ischemia, nor were her laboratory results.
Her BP and bradycardia resolved after a short period of pressor support.
Serial neurological exams did not show change.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**],  You came to our hospital for weakness and a recent fall.
Your low blood pressure and heart rate may have been due the medication Nadolol that you were taking, which we have stopped.
Imaging studies also showed that you had a fracture in your spine.
