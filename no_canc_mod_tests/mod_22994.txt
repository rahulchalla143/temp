At [**Hospital3 **] patient had carotid US revealing [**Country **]: 218/51, ICA/CCA ratio 3.46 ; [**Doctor First Name 3098**] 281/47, ICA/CCA ratio 4.66.
Cath at that time revealed 90-99% stenosis of the L ICA with post-stent imaging revealing good flow through the L ICA with 30% residual stenosis.
An EKG demonstrated some lateral ST segment changes concerning for ischemic change consistent with her known coronary stenoses which was reported to subsequently improve over approximately 4 hours.
Given the patient's chest pain and EKG changes, she was transferred to the CCU for observation while waiting for CABG.
[**2122-1-21**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2122-1-26**] Upper Extremity Ultrasound [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and basilic veins were performed.
Doppler evaluation demonstrates associated lack of flow in the right internal jugular vein.

The cardiology service was consulted and her cardiac enzymes were cycled which ruled her in for a myocardial infarction.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed normal right and left ventricular ejection fractions with no significant change from her prior study.
Over the next few days, Mrs.[**Known lastname 65620**] cardiac enzymes peaked and began to trend downward.
On discharge, her blood pressure and heart rate were 156/58 and 83 and her wounds were clean, dry and intact.
