A 1.5 cm linear region of increased signal intensity on FLAIR and T2- weighted images is seen in the medial aspect of the right hippocampus.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
He his transferred from outside hopital via [**Location (un) **] after head CT showing large right frontotemporal subdural hemorrahage.
Patient transferred to neuro ICU for hemodynamic monitoring and close neurologic examination.
His postoperative head CT reveales almost complete evacuation of subdural hematoma, with postoperaive changes with improved midline shift.
His immediate postoperative neurologic exam is poor; pupils are trace reactive, left smaller than right pupil, no corneals after postop day, however corneal reflexes returned in the afternoon, gag is present, extensor posturing on upper extremities, triple flexion on bilateral lower extremities.
An MRI was performed [**4-12**].
