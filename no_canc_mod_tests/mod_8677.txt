FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-4**], there is no change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
CTA OF THE CHEST  CLINICAL HISTORY: 75-year-old woman, status post descending aortic stent graft replacement with retroperitoneal hematoma and slowly dropping hematocrit.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were initially obtained through the chest and abdomen without contrast, followed by contrast-enhanced images through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.
FINDINGS:  CT OF THE CHEST:  There is marked diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, particularly the left thyroid lobe, most compatible with multinodular goiter.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  The liver is normal in size and contour.
CT OF THE PELVIS:  The urinary bladder is unremarkable.
Interval increase in the size of the right retroperitoneal hematoma which now also contains new hyperdense components suggestive of more accute hemorrhage.
