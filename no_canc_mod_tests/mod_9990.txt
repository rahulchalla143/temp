ECG ([**2107-5-20**] 8:23:28 AM) Sinus rhythm.
ECG ([**2107-5-22**] 3:24:00 AM) Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2107-5-20**] precordial T wave inversions are less pronounced.
ECG ([**2107-5-23**] 9:07:36 AM) Sinus rhythm with an atrial premature beat.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2107-5-23**] 8:37 AM) The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, similar from prior study.
Portable TTE (Complete) ([**2107-5-21**] 10:21:55 AM) The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to mild hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls (the anterior septum and anterior free wall are hyeprdynamic).
Cardiac Cath ([**2107-5-20**]) Coronary angiography showed right dominant system.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
Patient underwent cardiac cath on [**5-23**] which demonstrated widely patent LAD stent, mild non-significant CAD and no culprit for NSTEMI.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to mild hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls (the anterior septum and anterior free wall are hyperdynamic).
# Acute decompensated sytolic CHF (NYHA Class III): On presentation to OSH CXR showed florid pulmonary congestion.
BNP = 1300.
On HD3 patient creatinine elevated and decision made to hold to diuresis.
This required CPR and defibrillation x1 which subsequently converted her to normal sinus rhythm.
She was monitored on telemetry without further event.
No clear infiltrates on CXR except possible small infiltrate at left heart border.
# Anemia: Has baseline macrocytic anemia, with Hct ~ 30-31.
In OSH noted to have PR bleeding per-rectal examination and was guiaic positive.
Hct was 26 and she received PRBC X2, now Hct 31.
Creatinine in [**2107-1-1**] was 2.1.
Creatinine at time of discharge was 2.2. .
Her blood pressure was well controlled during her hospital stay.
Her lipid panel was normal.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily .
A UA was positive on [**5-25**], but she was asymptomatic.
Urine cultures were sent.
