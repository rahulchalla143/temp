TTE [**2159-2-15**]: MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.8 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *6.1 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.6 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.2 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 4.0 cm Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: *0.23 (nl >= 0.29) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 50% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 3.6 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *3.6 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aorta - Arch: *3.1 cm (nl <= 3.0 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.4 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.9 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.9 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.00 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 222 msec Conclusions: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the midventricular segment of the anterior free wall and of the apical segments of the posterior and lateral walls.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Peak CK was [**2170**].
Peak troponin was 3.61.
He was monitored on telemetry.
# Pump: TEE showed EF 50% (see reports/values) .
