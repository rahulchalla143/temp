On monitoring, her ventricular rate appeared to be in the 120-130s with runs of a wide-complex tachycardia (ventricular tachycardia vs. atrial fibrillation with aberrancy).
Of note, the patient had a recent CCU from [**2117-11-18**] to [**2117-11-19**] after she presented to an outside hospital with concerns for gastroenteritis and hypotension to the 80-90s systolic range; which was empirically treated with Vancomycin, Zosyn and stress dose IV steroids who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
On arrival, her GI losses were treated with IV fluids and in the ED she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to the 110s which was treated with Diltiazem, Amiodarone and Metoprolol.
She improved quickly, with resolution of her GI symptoms and improvement of her blood pressure off pressor support.
She also had a supratherapeutic INR of 3.3 on discharge, and her [**Hospital1 197**] was held and monitored closely.
She had activated her Life Watch device which transmitted her current rhythm to the monitoring center.
At [**Hospital **] hospital, she was in Afib with ventricular rate in 140s and received 2.5mg IV metoprolol.
Past Medical History: * Hypertension * Persistent atrial fibrillation (initially treated with Disopyramide, followed by Amiodarone, Atenolol and Dofetilide; all unsuccessful in restoring or maintaining sinus rhythm; she underwent pulmonary vein isolation in [**8-/2117**] - currently maintained on Disopyramide 300 mg PO Q12H and Metoprolol succinate 50 mg XL PO daily), * Atypical atrial flutter (which developed after PVI status-post  successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in [**9-/2116**]) * Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (last MRI in [**2115**] showed hypertrophy confined to the distal third and true apex portions of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction greater than 70%) * Ascending aortic aneurysm (measuring 4.2 x 4.3- cm in [**3-/2116**]) .

Her INR was subtherapeutic and she was bridged with Lovenox until her INR was greater then 2.0.
Stool studies from previous admission were unrevealing.
It is possible that her diarrhea, which was guaiac positive last admission, may be from IBD.
# CORONARIES - no prior history coronary artery disease; no cardiac catheterization procedures; last stress testing performed [**2113**] - she exercised for 8-minutes with a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol and had no EKG findings of concern with normal myocardial perfusion imaging - presenting without chest pain, EKG without evidence of active ischemia  # PUMP - last 2D-Echo performed on [**2117-11-18**] showing isolated apical left ventricular hypertrophy as well ([**Last Name (un) 51827**] variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy); left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%) with moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
This admission, she presents without evidence of volume overload on examination - lungs are clear, no peripheral edema and JVP appears minimally distended.
Continue to wear your event monitor at home and send daily strips and strips if you are symptomatic.
