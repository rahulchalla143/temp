CXR consistent with a very large heart, bilateral patchy opacities and L > R pleural effusion; also with BNP 5500 (no baseline) and Cr 2.3 up from 1.7 back in [**4-/2108**], and baseline appears to be mid 1's.
Review of her floor vitals shows progressive decrease in her SBP's from 110's to 90's, reported 70's by the primary team this am, and is 85 on evaluation most recently.
She is transferred to CCU for aggressive monitoring of blood pressure while being diuresed.
Coronary artery disease; nuclear stress test in [**1-/2100**] showed fixed inferolateral wall defect.
Chronic diastolic congestive heart faliure (EF 50% on [**8-/2108**] echo, apical akinesis, also 4+ TR at that time but grossly overloaded) -> admitted to CCU [**8-/2108**] with cardiogenic shock 3.
Breast Cancer, status post Left mastectomy, radiation, chemo; residual left upper extremity lymphedema.
External jugulars is grossly distende, internal jugular pulsations noted about 4.5 cm above her earlobe for total JVP ~12cm above RA level at ~45 degrees, +HJR Back is notably kyphotic, lung sounds very diminished with poor respiratory effort but gross wet sounding crackles noted diffusely and gross expiratory wheezes as well Irregular S1/S2 but no murmurs appreciated, nor S3/S4 Abdomen is soft but obese, NT ND, benign BLE with gross anasarca to the thighs, and bilateral shins exhibit gross chronic lymphedematous changes reminischent of elephantiasis with scaly hyperkeratosis on a diffuse background of chronic erythematous hyperpigmentation; also with pitting edema.

Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is borderline as other segments are hyperdynamic (LVEF= 50%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-5-7**], the degree of TR has increased.
The apical aneurysm and overal LVEF are similar (LVEF underestimated on prior report), The LVOT mass was present but is now more prominent (likely due to different angulation rather than major changes).
If indicated, a cardiac MRI would be ebst to characterize all of the elements mentioned above.
CXR [**2108-9-12**]: PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm above the carina.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

She was diuresed a total of 17.5 litres and returned to her presumed dry weight of 60.1 kg.
Blood gas suggested poor ventilation and patient was emergently intubated.
PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 5001**] extubation, BAL was collected and sent for gram stain and culture, which was positive for PCP.
To rule out acute HIV infection, HTLV-[**1-8**] and HIV viral load was sent and was pending at time of discharge.
Pt reported no significant risk factors for HIV infection except for a blood transfusion in [**Country 532**] that happened many years ago.
She was started on bactrim DS TID for three days and transitioned to Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 **] and will need a total of 21 days of treatment to end on .
# ARF:  Pt had a Cr of 2.3 on admission up from a baseline of 1.5.
Urine electrolytes confirmed a prerenal etiology.
Cr of 2.8-2.9 is likely a new baseline for her.
INR was transiently increased to >5 at time of intubation despite withholding coumadin.
At time of discharge INR was 2.5 on dose of 2mg daily.
#Anemia: Hct dropped from 38.5 on admission to 29.8 by hospital day three.
Stool guiauc was negative and only active bleeding that she had was transient epistaxis.
Over last ten days of hospitalization her Hct remained stable.
Hemolysis labs were negative, ferritin elevated likely secondary to acute inflammatory response.
Will need to have further workup as outpt.
FEN: 1.5 L fluid restriction speech and swallow eval at discharge: RECOMMENDATIONS: 1.
You will need to have an evaluation of your stomach and colon in the future to see where the bleeding is coming from.
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 4. discontinue zolpidem, trazadone and lisinopril.
Start heparin injections to prevent blood clots 8.
