The computerized tomography scan of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolus but positive for lymphadenopathy and positive for pleural effusion with scattered pulmonary nodularities.
The patient also on evaluation was being worked up for the possibility of encarditis for which the transesophageal echocardiography was ordered to do DC cardioversion for his atrial fibrillation and rule out the endocarditis at the same time.
His transesophageal echocardiography also showed a foiled mitral valve leaflet with 3 to 4 plus mitral regurgitation.
He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**9-30**], which showed a wedge pressure of 28 V waves to 40 ml of mercury.

Calcium 8.7, phosphorus 3.0, magnesium 2.7, albumin 3.5, blood cultures times two were pending at that time.
His chest x-ray from [**9-26**], showed bilateral effusions and evidence of congestive heart failure.
Additional laboratory data were as follows, ALT 90, AST 34, LDH 573, alkaline phosphatase 96 and total bilirubin of 0.7.
TIBC 303, ferritin 494, TRF 233.
TSH 0.6.
His INR was elevated and his surgery which was planned for [**10-2**] was cancelled while we waited for his INR to come back down to normal range.
Consult was also obtained to evaluate his elevated INR which at that point his last dose of Coumadin had been six days prior with an INR of 2.3.
Later that day, his INR dropped to 1.7.
His creatinine remained stable at 1.2.
On the [**10-3**], the patient's INR was still elevated at approximately 1.4 in the evening and this was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Plans to recheck his INR at 2 AM and to call the results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 955**], the surgery resident.
As the patient's repeat INR was 1.3, it was discussed with the patient and family to hold off for surgery for another couple of days until Monday morning to allow the INR to continue to drop.
Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed which showed bilateral small pleural effusions and multiple peripheral hypodensities in a spleen which was enlarged as well as some hypodensities in the right upper poles of the kidney.
Laboratory data postoperatively were as follows, white count 24, hematocrit 29.4, platelet count 330,000, potassium 5.0, BUN 20 and creatinine 1.1.
His examination was otherwise unremarkable with 1 plus peripheral edema.
On postoperative day Number 3, the blood pressure was 111/64, heart rate was 80, receiving 20 of Metoprolol p.o.
On postoperative day Number 4, he was awake and alert with a temperature maximum of 98.6.
His heart rate was 75 and in sinus rhythm with a respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure 114/55, sating 96 percent on room air.
His INR was 1.2 with a white count of 17.6 and a hematocrit of 28.1 and platelet count of 498,000.
at bedtime, take as directed by    the patient's primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 8398**]for    a goal INR of 2 to 2.5.
