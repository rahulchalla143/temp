With all these supports patient was able to have cardiac output of 5.8 and cardiac index of 3.3.
Without these supports patient's cardiac output was 4.9 with index of 2.77 on post-op day four.
Therefore, patient was taken to the operating room and underwent exploratory laparotomy which, unfortunately, did not show any signs of ischemic bowel or any other intra-abdominal pathology to explain her sudden decompensation.
Two days later her culture returned gram negative rods in her blood, also gram negative rods in the sputum.
In the next day or so her clinical condition actually improved with her creatinine discomfort from as high as 3 to 1.7 and she was making an adequate amount of urine, up to 1700 cc per day.
Her urine output decreased.
Moreover her acidosis returned and her white count suddenly increased again to the 30s.
Patient underwent ultrasound which revealed thickened gallbladder wall, pericholecystic fluid and sludge in the gallbladder, all of which could be explained from previous laparotomy as well as her septic physiology.
Intraoperatively once again there was no obvious pathology found, however, a cholecystostomy tube was placed given the fact that patient had the ultrasound which suggested that she may have cholecystitis and she does have evidence of stones.
In fact, her blood pressure consistently dropped, requiring going up on the pressors.
This, too, did not help her blood pressure.
Her blood pressure remained very tenuous in the high 70s systolic blood pressure.
