This happened several times in the spring of [**2169**] and by mid spring of last year, he was noted to have high levels of peripheral eosinophils as well as eos in his sputum (BAL [**7-/2169**]), and the patient was treated for worms given his exposure abroad.
Several motility and EGD studies have not revealed a clear cause for his dysmotility.
In the ED, his systolic blood pressure fell to 89; he had 2 L of fluid given with improvement in his pressure to 100 systolic.
He was placed initially on a nonrebreather which was quickly weaned to a venti-mask, his saturations in the low 90s.
Chest x-ray was obtained showing bilateral lower lobe infiltrates that remain unchanged from prior chest x-ray and likely are secondary to his underlying eosinophilic process.
