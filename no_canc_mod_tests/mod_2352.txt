In the ED, VS were Tc 98.8, BP 138/77, HR 100, RR 28, SaO2 100%/NRB, AO x 1.
Labs were significant for an ABG 7.01/77/113 on a NRB, K of 8.0 initially, Cr of 6.0.
She was given a dose of narcan and awoke marginally, but was still somnolent.
During her course, her SBP's dropped to the 60's-70's systolic and she was given a total of 5 L NS with response of SBPs to 110's.
Serum tox was negative, urine tox not obtainable at that time as pt was anuric in ED.

CXR [**3-22**]: Right subclavian vascular catheter has been placed, with the tip terminating within the lower superior vena cava.
The lung volumes are lower on the current study compared to the previous exam.
Examination is otherwise without change from the recent study of earlier the same date.
CXR [**3-22**]: Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube with its tip at the level of the clavicular heads.
CT Abd/Pelvis/Chest [**3-22**]: 1.
CT Head [**3-22**]: The study is limited by motion artifact.
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to motion.
CXR [**3-22**]: Comparison is made to [**2166-11-28**] and multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to [**2165-4-17**].
Echo [**3-23**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CXR [**3-28**]: A right subclavian central line is present, tip over distal SVC.

Serum tox was negative, urine tox (not obtainable in ED secondary to anuria) eventually was positive for opiates and cocaine.
Her initial BNP was [**Numeric Identifier 13515**] and CK 5593 (peaked [**Numeric Identifier 13516**]).
TTE showed global hypokinesis.
Sputum grew 4+ GPC's (speciated Strep pneumo, MRSA).
She was discharged the day after admission with a prescription for clindamycin to complete a 7-day course.
