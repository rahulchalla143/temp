At his PCP's office, he was febrile to 102.9 and hypotensive to 92/61, labs showed a Cr of 1.7 from a baseline of 1.2 to 1.1 and a white count of 14.1, urinalysis was positive for blood and protein.
His labs were noteable for Creatinine of 1.5, Na of 132, WBC of 12.9.
VS at 2:30am were 160s/AF, RR: 33, 99% 3L, 147/112.
EKG in the ER was atrial fibrillation at 151bpm with TWI in III and aVF.
He then desaturated to 87% on 3LNC with a HR in the 160's, so he underwent a CTA, which was negative for PE but confirmed the LLL PNA that was seen on CXR.
VS on transfer were: 101.1, 120s, 154/90, 27, 93% on 6LNC.

Blood Cultures 8/9,8/11,[**7-21**]: neg  Other pertinent labs:  Imaging: .
CXR [**7-17**]: Left lower lobe pneumonia.
CT head w/o contrast [**7-18**]: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or vascular territorial infarct.
TTE [**7-18**]:  Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
CTA chest [**7-18**]: The visualized pulmonary vasculature shows no evidence of filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolus.
Opacifications at the left lung base with air bronchograms as well as small opacification in the right lung base are consistent with pneumonia.
CXR [**7-19**]: Relatively symmetric peribronchial opacification has worsened on the left, now accompanied by moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
CXR [**7-21**]: (post extubation) Comparison is made with prior study from the same date earlier in the morning.
LUENI [**7-23**]: FINDINGS: The study is limited in evaluation due to left upper extremity swelling.
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left internal jugular, left subclavian, left brachial, and left basilic veins were performed.
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to overlying soft tissue swelling.

#) Community Acquired Pneumonia: Patient with CXR and chest CT with contrast showing evidence of LLL PNA.
In the setting of diarrhea and abdominal pain, legionella was on differential, but urine and sputum legionella were negative.
On [**7-18**], patientdesatted to med 80s on face mask and ABG demonstrated a respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.47 pCO2 35 pO2 57.
Oxygen saturations did not improve, so proceeded with elective intubation.
His SBP was low, and he had a pressor requirement briefly.
A stat TTE was obtained which demonstrated reduced cardiac function, and mild global hypokinesis.
Given hazy appearance/bilateral infiltrates of CXR which persisted along with PaO2/FiO2 <200, likely there was ARDS secondary to an infectious etiology.
Urine strep pneumo antibody negative.
Although urine legionella assay was negative, per ID, the urinary assay only identifies 70% of strains, so patient was treated with high dose ceftriaxone (2g IV q2) through [**7-25**].
A bronchoscopy was done which did not demonstrate any purulent secretions.
BAL gram stain, legionella cultures, pneumocystis jirovecci, fungal culture and acid fast smear were all negative.
--repeat CXR in [**3-15**] weeks to document improving infiltrate  #) Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: Patient does report prior history of Afib, back in [**2139**] and was seen at [**Hospital1 112**].
His outpatient cardiologist at the time was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] has been on full dose ASA and had came off Toprol XL in [**2145**] when his Rx ran out and he never refilled it On admission, he was started on a diltiazem gtt at 5mg/hr with a HR in the 140's to 160's at rest.
Blood pressure tolerated the dilt gtt well, uptitrated to 15mg still with no effect on HR.
TSH was checked and came back at 4.8 so hyperthyroidism not thought to be cause of afib.
Heart rate was diffiucult to control with diltiazem and metoprolol as his blood pressure was not tolerating it in the ICU, so he was startd on amiodarone ggt and then oral amio, which was d/c'd on [**7-25**] as he had remained in NSR on the floor on both amio and metoprolol 50mg TID.
#)Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive in the ICU to SBP of 190s.
He was started on Lisinopril 20mg PO daily and blood pressures normalized.
A UENI was obtained which showed left basilic vein thrombus.
Legionella testing was neg and sodium normalized.
Discharge Instructions: Med Changes: NEW: levofloxacin NEW: full dose aspirin NEW: lisinopril (blood pressure pill)  Items for follow up []You will need to have your LFTs and CBC add Chem7 checked next week []blood pressure control []discuss afib and decision to use aspirin vs. coumadin with your PCP []repeat CXR in [**3-15**] weeks because of L lung infiltrate  You were hospitalized for a serious pneumonia, which required treatment with antibiotics and ICU care involving pulmonary support on a ventilator.
