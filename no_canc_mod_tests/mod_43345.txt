Labs came back with a potassium of 7.4 so she was given insulin/D50 and calcium.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, after transferring from EMS stretcher no pulse was felt.
CPR was initiated and one 2 minute cycle was perfromed, epinephrine, calcium, bicarb all were all given once.
ETT confirmed w/ CXR and ETCO2.
On arrival to the MICU, Vitals were Temp: 99, HR: 98, BP: 126/67 RR: 28 O2: 100%.
Her left and right femoral lines were removed and a left CVL was placed as was a left arterial line.

Pertinent Results: IMAGING:  EEG [**2109-6-30**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The EEG background showed the slow cortical activity and bursts of generalized slowing throughout indicative of severe diffuse encephalopathy.
CT Head [**2109-6-30**] FINDINGS:  There are EEG electrodes in place.
Fluid-opacification of the nasopharynx and nasal cavity, with layering fluid in the sphenoid and ethmoidal air cells and maxillary sinuses, likely relates to intubation and supine positioning.
If there is concern for acute hypoxic-ischemic injury, MRI would be more sensitive.
CT Chest [**2109-6-30**] FINDINGS:  Evaluation is slightly limited in the absence of intravenous contrast; however, the mediastinal vessels appear normal in caliber.
CXR [**2109-6-30**] The left internal jugular central line has been repositioned so that its tip now lies in the proximal SVC.
Echocardiogram [**2109-7-1**] Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).

after heorin, and possibly other illicit substances overdose presenting to first to [**Hospital3 4107**].
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED she underwent PEA arrest and was [**Last Name (un) 7162**] resuscitated.
Her troponin, which was initially elevated, decreased subsequently.
A trans-thoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed no abnormal findings.
Liver enzymes were trended.
Hepatitis B and C serologies were found to be positive.
#Aspiration Pneumonia: Initially her white count was elevated to approximately 30.0 there was concern that this could be due to septic shock vs acute phase reaction in the setting of cardiac arrest.
A CT chest done to evaluate a wide mediastinum in the ED showed extensive bilateral consolidations extending from the hila consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Her sputum grew out gram negative rods consistant with an aspiration source.
Sputum Cx were found to be growing stenotrophomonas sensitive to bactrim.
#Widended Mediastinum: A chest xray showed a wide mediastinum.
Given the patients inability to communicate and her cardiac arrest a CT of her chest was done to futher characterize her widened mediastinum.
The CT showed no evidence of mediastinal vascular injury.
She was given intravenous fluids, her creatinine kinase was trended, and a bicarbonate drip was started and subsequently discontinued prior to theraputic hypothermia.
Her creatinine kinase trended downward consistantly over her time in the MICU.
#Acute Renal Failure: On admission her creatinine was 2.2.
With intravenous fluid and hemodialysis her creatinine decreased to within normal reference range.
Her blood glucose maintain within normal ranges on a insulin sliding scale.
EKG did not reveal any acute changes but she was found to have elevated troponins with a peak (.11->.14->.12).
She was started on aspirin and beta-blocker for NSTEMI although the significance of the elevated troponins in the setting of post cardiac arrest is not certain given that her troponin level was in the range of .05-.09 in the post arrest setting and there were no troponin levels for several days prior to the chest pain.
-Pt should have a cardiac stress test as an outpatient given single episode of chest pain and rise in trops while in the hosptial -Pt is to follow up at the [**Hospital1 2177**] dental clinic for dental work and possible tooth extraction   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
