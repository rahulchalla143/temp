Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed severe left-main and multivessel CAD: --the LMCA had an 80% distal stenosis --the LAD had a 95% ostial stenosis.
Left ventriculography revealed measured LVEF 77%, normal LV systolic function and no mitral regurgitation.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided filling pressures, with LVEDP 16 mmHg.
Systemic arterial systolic pressures were normal, with SBP 132 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
