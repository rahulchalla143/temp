Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20% 4.
Coumadin  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION (on transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service):   Vital signs:  Temperature 97.8, blood pressure 108/44, heart rate 112, respiratory rate 15 to 20, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Jugular venous pressure to approximately 10 cm.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, without rales, rhonchi or wheezes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 59-year-old female with an extensive cardiac history, including end stage congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20% on home dopamine, found to have an apparent tachy arrhythmia in the field.
The patient was initially accepted to the Coronary Care Unit given the patient was on home dopamine drip, and then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for EP evaluation for possible AICD vs. amiodarone for rate control.
End stage congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of less than 20% on home dopamine drip 4.
