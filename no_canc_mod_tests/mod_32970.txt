Neurosurgery/INR consultation and if necessary, further imaging with MR/conventional angiogram can be considered.
Video Swallow: Patient is noted with decreased alertness compared to his evaluation on [**4-1**].
Recommend video swallow evaluation tomorrow to further assess patient's oral and pharyngeal swallowing function and determine the safest diet.
This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of Level 1, NPO  [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname **] [**Age over 90 82698**] M  86  [**2032-1-28**]  Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2118-3-31**] 10:26 PM   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] J.

COMPARISON: CTA head, [**2118-3-31**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial images of the head are obtained at 5-mm section thickness.
FINDINGS: Evaluation is somewhat limited secondary to motion even after multiple attempts at acquisition, specifically at the skull base.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained without IV contrast.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 106 0 92 356/436 0 12 42   ([**-8/2714**])   Brief Hospital Course: This patient was admitted to the ICU for observation with concern that he would deteriorate and possibly need either surgical evacuation or a ventirculostomy.
He gradually improved and actually passed a swallow evaluation by speech therapy before leaving the ICU.
Patient's exam continues to wax and wane, and his swallowing ability has worsened.
His rate stabilized and he was transferred to floor with tele.
He is due for discharge to rehab with tele monitoring x 3 days.
