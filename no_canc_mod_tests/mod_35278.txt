MRA Head ([**2107-4-1**]):  The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
CT Head ([**2107-4-1**]): Left mid brain and cerebral peduncle hemorrhage with minimal worsening of surrounding edema.
She was intubated for airway protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where her neurological exam was notable for GCS of 7 (E1V1M5), right eye hyperconvergence, right eye below left eye on vertical oculocephalics, mild right hemiparesis and ICH score of 3.
Subsequent MR/MRA showed an acute midbrain hemorrhage in the tegmental region with mild surrounding edema and findings indicative of mild-to-moderate obstructive hydrocephalus.
Patient was transferred to Neuro ICU for Q1h checks, mannitol, BP control, cardiac enzyme cycling and wean from intubation.
Exam improved over hospital course, but patient had residual diplopia at baseline with findings of diplopia at end gaze bilaterally, R eye hyperconvergence, L eye inward on vertical gaze, impaired vertical/lateral eye movements and temperature deficit of RUE.
Bleed was felt to be attributable to an underlying vascular malformation (cavernous hemangioma) not well-visualized on imaging in the setting of an acute bleed.
Also, you will need to have a repeat MRI scan prior to your appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**].
