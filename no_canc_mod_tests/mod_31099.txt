In the ED, she was found to have stable vital signs but acute renal failure (creatinine 3.4), hyperkalemia (5.8), and acutely elevated LFT's (ALT 1253, AST 2409, LDH 2200).
Ultrasound was consistent with acute hepatitis, without evidence of vascular throbmosis or cirrhosis.
Surgery team evaluated the abd CT which did not show evidence of obstrucion or ischemia despite elevated lactate of 5.
Over her stay, creatinine and transaminases trended down.

A renal U/S did not show evidence of hydronephrosis.
She had a unimpressive UA and UCulture was negative.
She initially received insulin, calcium gluconate, and kayexalate for HyperK-her EKG did not show hyperacute T waves and she had no dysrhythmias on tele.
On the wards, her creatinine continued to trend downwards and was WNL at 1.1 at time of discharge.
She did not appear to be in decompensated CHF and transaminases were markedly elevated, so this is less likely secondary to pure congestive hepatopathy.
A liver U/S with doppler was negative for arterial or venous ischemia/thrombus.
Hepatitis serologies for A, B, C were all negative.
Severe AS: Not surgical candidate due to several comorbidities based on surgical evaluation from last admission.
Her fluid balance was closely monitored.
A Hgb A1c was 4.9%.
MVI 1 cap daily 2.
You blood sugars were slightly elevated on this admission.
