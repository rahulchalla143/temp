Bilateral lung contusions, and small right pneumothorax.
Head CT [**9-5**] 1.
MRI C/T/L Spine:[**9-5**] C-SPINE No evidence of cervical spine malalignment or cervical cord impingement.
This area is better visualized on the CT scan, where multiple bone fragments are evident.
An important finding on this study is edema within the spinal cord centered at the T4 level, but extending superiorly and inferiorly for about a segment.
[**9-19**] Head CT 1.
[**2162-9-28**] EMG/Nerve Conduction Study by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 4739**] B.
Right median motor conduction study was normal.
Right median and ulnar sensory responses, performed for comparison purposes, were normal.
Needle examination of selected muscles of the left upper extremities representing the C5-T1 myotomes revealed ongoing denervation in multiple muscles, including those innervated by the median and ulnar nerves, as well as the musculocutaneous nerve.
Needle examination of the cervical paraspinal muscles could not be performed as the patient was in a hard collar.
Repeat study after the cervical collar is removed may provide additional diagnostic information regarding the possible contribution of cervical nerve root injury.
Brief Hospital Course: HD#1 - Patient received endotracheal tuber for airway protection, neurosurgery was consulted, high dose Solu-Medrol started, right chest tube paced for pneumothorax, and MRI of C/T/L spine obtained.
HD#2 - Hematocrit dropped from 35 to 24, transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units fresh fozen plasma for coagulopathy with INR=1.5.
Chest tube was placed on water seal and then pulled when repeat CXR demonstrated no pneumothorax.
HD#6 - Started on Zosyn for sputum culture with gram negative rods.
HD#7 - Required fluid boluses for decreased CVP and urine output.
HCT dropped to 24 and patient recieved 1 unit PRBC and 2 units FFP.
Repeat head CT demonstrated increased epidural hematoma.
HD#11 -  Spiked to 101.7 and CXR has new L basilar infiltrate.
HD #17 - Chest radiograph showing improving bibasilar infiltrates, medications changed to PO.
UA was negative, WBC not increased, CXR shows improved opacities at right lung base, but worsening retrocardiac density.
Blood cultures were sent.
All cultures including blood culture and central line tip continue to have no growth.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] most recent CT scan from [**2162-9-19**] showed the following:  epidural hematoma in the left middle fossa, essentially stable since the previous exam.
Extensive fever work-up included blood culture, urine cultures, picc line tip culture, chest x-ray, humerus/hardware x-ray & T/L-spine CT to evaluate for abcess or osteomyelitis.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for as needed for lack of bowel movements.
Disp:*[**Numeric Identifier 31034**] Unitsunits* Refills:*2* 6.
Clonidine HCl 0.1 mg/24 hr Patch Weekly Sig: One (1) Patch Weekly Transdermal QSAT (every Saturday).
Filter will be removed when C-spine cleared and following a LE venous doppler --ID: recent fevers, negative work-up including blood/urine culture & imaging of hardware w/o evidence of abcess/osteomyelitis.
Please follow dilantin levels as needed.
