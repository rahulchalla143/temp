Review of systems at that time was negative for nausea, vomiting and positive for lightheadedness and palpitations which had been present at baseline.
At that time, arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.15, pCO2 68, pO2 68 with a CPK of 45 and troponin less than 0.3.
At that time, the patient's blood pressure was noted to be 209/129.
Post intubated arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.31, pCO2 45 and pO2 106.
Of note, urine output was 1,300 cc from the intravenous Lasix.
Outside laboratory data were significant for an AST of 39, ALT 53, alkaline phosphatase 217, total bilirubin 0.9, white blood cell count 11.1, hematocrit 45, platelet count 283,000, sodium 146, potassium 3.6, bicarbonate 23, chloride 105, BUN 24, creatinine 1.7 and blood sugar 251.
His Emergency Room stay was notable for a urine output of 800 cc.
History of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction at age 50, again in [**2195-5-22**], status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2182**] with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery; most recent cardiac catheterization in [**2195-5-22**] showed 100% proximal left anterior descending artery lesion, 50% mid- left anterior descending artery lesion, 70% first marginal lesion, 100% proximal right coronary artery lesion with collaterals coming from the circumflex to the right coronary artery, left ventricular ejection fraction 25% with mild mitral regurgitation; right heart catheterization showed elevated right sided pressures including a right atrial pressure of 24, right ventricular pressure 50, pulmonary artery pressure 52/20 and wedge of 33, cardiac output 6.05 and cardiac index 2.79.
Status post AICD placement on [**2195-5-27**]; patient had been transferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] to [**Hospital6 8866**] after developing chest pain and shortness of breath; he was found hypotensive and in respiratory failure, requiring intubation; he became tachycardiac and went into pulseless ventricular tachycardia and required shock; he ruled in at [**Hospital3 1280**] with a high CK and, at [**Hospital6 8866**] workup included cardiac catheterization, echocardiogram and exercise tolerance test; ICD placement was also at that time; the device is known to be a Guident device, the details of which will be included in a discharge addendum.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission, the patient had a pulse of 75, blood pressure 133/87, respiratory rate 13 and oxygen saturation 93% on two liters oxygen and 88% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, oropharynx unable to be examined secondary to intubation, extraocular movements intact.
Chest:  Midline coronary artery bypass grafting scar, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 12.3 with a differential of 85.7% neutrophils, 8.7% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 1.3% eosinophils and 0.3% basophils, hematocrit 36.6, platelet count 202,000, prothrombin time 19.7, partial thromboplastin time 31.3, INR 2.7, sodium 141, potassium 5.7, chloride 103, bicarbonate 27, BUN 24, creatinine 1.4, blood sugar 96, and first CK with a troponin of 1.6.
Urinalysis showed large blood, 1,120 red blood cells, 6 to 10 white blood cells, occasional bacterial and 0 to 2 epithelial cells.
Electrocardiogram from [**2195-5-22**] showed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate between 100 to 120, ST elevations and inverted T waves and Q waves present in leads II and AVF, ST depressions and inversions of T wave present in leads V4 through V6, inverted T wave also present in V1; this was compared with the most recent electrocardiogram from [**2195-10-31**], showing sinus rhythm with minimal ST elevations and inverted T waves in leads III and AVF, Q waves still present in leads II, III and AVF, right sided leads showed no ST elevation in lead V4R, there were occasional Q waves in leads V4 through V6.
Chest x-ray showed improvement in congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram from outside hospital showed severely reduced left ventricular systolic function with a ejection fraction of 25% to 30%, akinesis of the posterior wall, basal and mid-portions of the septum and inferior wall, hypokinesis in the rest of the ventricles, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, enlarged left atrium.
Adenosine Cestimibi in [**2195-5-22**] showed a fixed inferolateral defect with a systolic ejection fraction of 26%.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for further evaluation and observation.
Three serial CKs were done showing values of 83 with troponin of 1.6, 244 with troponin of 1.5, and 336.
The troponin-I levels were not suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction per laboratory standards.
Repeat cardiac catheterization was considered but, in light of Mr. [**Known lastname 5024**] recent catheterization and flat CKs, he instead underwent an exercise treadmill test on Tuesday, [**2195-11-3**].
This showed a severe fixed perfusion defect of the inferior wall and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with global hypokinesis.
However, the stress test showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 37%.
He was continued on Zestril after the day of admission, with good blood pressure effects.
He was asymptomatic throughout and his blood pressure was well maintained.
The patient underwent electrophysiology studies on [**2195-11-4**], which discovered multiple foci of atrial flutter, some of which were ablated.
Renal:  Mr. [**Known lastname 5024**] creatinine on admission was 1.7.
He had good urine output throughout.
Hematology:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a hematocrit of 45 at the outside hospital.
His hematocrit at this facility was 36.6 on admission.
His INR was also monitored.
Coumadin was held secondary to possible invasive intervention such as cardiac catheterization, which would require an INR of less than 1.5.
On [**2195-11-3**], his INR was noted to be below 2 and a heparin drip was restarted.
