CTA showed likely left posterior tibial artery occlusion for which she was started on heparin; she had a spontaneous return of pulse and heparin was stopped.
The pt started to desat to the 70s and the anesthesia team decided to intubate.
CT of the head was taken to rule out hemmorhage given recent use of heparin.
CTA of chest was taken, given pts suspected DVT and recent surgery and wet read was negative for PE.
She was started on Vanc/Zosyn given hypoxia, hypotension, and small pleural effusions on CT chest, although she was afebrile.
KUB showed ileus and there was no obstruction on CT. RP hematoma had been seen on L spine CT [**2179-7-28**] (5.8 x 3.5 cm), and was stable on CT [**2179-7-29**] (5.3 x 3.6 cm).
Hct was stable.
