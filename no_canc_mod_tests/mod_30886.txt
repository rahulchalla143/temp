HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51-year-old female with a history of increasing fatigue, increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest discomfort with known rheumatic fever, who was admitted for cardiac catheterization on [**2147-10-27**].
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The cardiac examination was significant for an S1 and S2 and a grade II/VI systolic ejection murmur.
The extremities were warm with palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and no peripheral edema noted.
The oromaxillofacial surgery service was called and the patient underwent a tooth extraction on [**2147-10-28**].
The patient was doing well on the floor until postoperative day #2, when she developed rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 160s, requiring intravenous Lopressor for rate control.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained to ensure that there was no clot in the left atrium.
Once her INR dropped to below 1.8, the patient underwent dual chamber pacemaker placement with a Medtronics bipolar pacing, bipolar sensing pacemaker.
On the day of discharge, the patient was clear to auscultation and in a regular rhythm.
Her sternum was stable and dry.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The instructions for anticoagulation were that a target INR of 3 to 3.5 should be attained.
Until that occurs, heparin should be maintained with a target partial thromboplastin time of 60 to 80.
