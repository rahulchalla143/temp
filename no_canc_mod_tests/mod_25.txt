She saw her PCP and performed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest x-ray, which revealed a right upper lobe density.
This was followed up with a CT scan, which revealed a lobulated mass of 2.3 cm in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe and bilateral lobe interstitial fibrosis.
Follow-up PET scan was nondiagnostic.
The patient had a mediastinoscopy, which showed no evidence of malignancy or lymph nodes.
Lung biopsy was performed, which revealed pulmonary fibrosis.
She was urgently brought to the trauma bay, there her heart rate was in the 30s with the EKG revealing a junctional rhythm.
Her SBP was in the 80s.
Subsequent labs revealed a potassium of 9.8.
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to evaluate her hypotension and revealed an SVR of 2473 with a cardiac output of 2.2.
Two hours later, the cardiac output was 6.5 and SVR was 898 after pressors were weaned down.
Urgent TTE revealed normal systolic function, no pericardial effusion.
Potassium dropped to 4.3 after 1 day.
By hospital day 3, she was off pressors, her white blood count was 16.1.
She was then transferred to the MICU for further workup and care.
Calcium carbonate.
Vitamin E.   PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the MICU, temperature 98.9 degrees, blood pressure 126/61, and pulse 108.
Cardiac exam was within normal limits.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to the MICU included a white count of 21.9, hematocrit of 29.3, and  platelets of 85.
Chest x-ray on admission to MICU revealed persistent bilateral upper lobe patchy opacities, may represent interstitial edema plus aspiration.
After several days in the CCU, she was on 3 different pressors and was unable to maintain her blood pressure.
