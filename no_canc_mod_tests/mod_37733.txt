She was discharged on a reduced dose of torsemide and also told to stop her lisinopril, HCTZ, and spironolactone.
Her weight had increased by 30 lbs by the end of [**Month (only) 547**] and was told to increase her torsemide to twice a day, but her weight continued to increase to 360 lbs by [**4-30**] and she started to become more SOB and wheezy.
In addition, her BP was noted to be 80/60 and her O2 sat on RA was 92%.
She was reluctant to come to the hospital and so the plan was to increase torsemide to 80mg [**Hospital1 **] if her SBP was >90.
EKG was unchanged from prior.
CXR showed mild fluid overload.
Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVT.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2122-5-3**] 9:11 PM IMPRESSION: A mild congestive failure with stable marked cardiomegaly.
Right Upper Ext ultrasound [**5-8**]: No DVT in the right upper extremity.
CXR [**5-20**]: Marked cardiomegaly is stable.
TTE [**2122-5-21**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-3-17**], partial flail anterior mitral leaflet is now present.
The mitral regurgitation may be increased, and may be significantly underestimated on this study due to the Coanda effect.
The left ventricular ejection fraction is increased on the current study.
CXR [**5-31**]: The tip of the PICC line lies in the mid to upper SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: 56F with chronic systolic CHF (EF 15%) from non-ischemic cardiomyopathy thought to be due to cocaine abuse, HTN, and morbid obesity admitted with decompensated heart failure and acute renal failure.
Baseline SBP 80-100's during ICU stay for 1 day.
Upon return to the floor, further diuretics were held, and patient's Creatinine decreased to 1.7 on the day of discharge.
Her lisinopril and spirinolactone were being held in the setting of relatively low blood pressures; these agents will likely need to be restarted as an outpatient.
Her electrolytes were repleted aggressively.
Although her creatinine initially improved with diuresis, it began to climb as discussed above.
She did have a hypontensive episode into the 70s and there was concern that she may have ATN [**1-17**] hypotension; however urine sediment did not show muddy brown casts.
Her weight was 123kg (272-275lbs).
# Gout: continued home allopurinol  # GERD: Patient was continued on a PPI per her home regimen, but when her creatinine worsened, the PPI was stopped.
Her sodium improved as her fluid shifted into the vascular space.
