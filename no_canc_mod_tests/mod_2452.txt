In the ER of OSH her VS were 128/82 mmHg, HR 71 BPM, RR 20, 97% on RA and T 97.9 F. She had ST elevations in II, III, AVF (aVF>III>II) with Trop I of 3.22, CK 391 and MB 43.6 (MBI 11.1).
Patient was given Aspirin 81 mg x1, heparin gtt with 4000 bolus, plavix 75 mg x1, nitroglycern 0.4 mg SL x1, nitroglycerin gtt and was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
In cardiac cath she received two [**2-5**] loading doses of integrillin and had an angiogram that showed sub-occluded mid-distal RCA.
CAD - in [**1-5**], Had ptca to D1, in [**2139-4-3**], admitted with recurrent chest pain and ruled out for an MI.
Cath revealed a 90% diagonal lesion s/p PTCA/stenting with BMS (2.0 x 23mm) to the diagonal.
Osteoarthritis 3.
HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear, Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
LYMPH - no cervical, axillary, or inguinal LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**6-8**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, steady gait PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+, Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: Admission Labs ([**2145-8-29**]) WBC-9.2 Hgb-12.1 Hct-36.1 Plt Ct-227 PT-14.4 PTT-150 INR(PT)-1.3 Cholest-110 Triglyc-106 HDL-41 CHOL/HD-2.7 LDLcalc-48 Glucose-105 UreaN-13 Creat-0.6 Na-135 K-4.3 Cl-106 HCO3-20 Mg-1.9  Cardiac Catheterization ([**2145-8-29**]): Right dominant coronary system.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
**Final cath report pending at time of discharge  Echo ([**2145-8-30**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2139-1-29**], mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now seen.
Discharge Labs ([**2145-8-31**]) WBC-8.2 Hgb-12.8 Hct-39.6 Plt Ct-264 Glucose-98 UreaN-14 Creat-0.7 Na-140 K-4.2 Cl-109 HCO3-20 CK(CPK)-738 ALT-17 AST-56 LDH-316 CK(CPK)-401 AlkPhos-58 TotBili-1.1  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 79 yo F with prior history of hypertension, CAD s/p MI and BMS to D1 in [**2139**] who presented with a STEMI, now s/p cardiac cath and BMSx2 to the mid-distal RCA.
She was emergently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
She was also continued on Metoprolol 25mg po BID with a target HR of 50-70.
She was not started on an ACE-inhibitor as her blood pressures were at goal, but this may benefit the patient in the future.
She had a TTE in the hospital which showed preserved ejection fraction and systolic function, as well as very mild mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
