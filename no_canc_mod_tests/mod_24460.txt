In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was hypertensive on arrival with BP 180s, intubated and sedated on propofol.

Neurosurgical team performed bilateral placement of external ventricular drains (EVDs).
His phenytoin level was therapeutic; however, phenytoin was switched to levetiracetam.
A repeat head CT on [**2170-12-3**] showed improvement with less blood in the ventricles.
He underwent renal MRI which showed no renal artery stenosis.
CSF showed elevated WBC.
Gram stain and all cultures were negative.
He was transitioned to Coumadin without complication and has a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5 due to his risk of repeat ICH.
Acute renal failure: Prior to discharge, his creatinine increased to 1.8 from a baseline of 1.0.
His creatinine was 1.7 at the time of discharge.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
You also had a blood clot in your leg, part of which broke off and went to your lungs.
You also had high blood pressure during your admission and your medications were adjusted.
You need to have your INR checked after you leave the hospital by your rehab facility.
If your creatinine is improved, you should have your creatinine checked weekly to make sure that it continues to improve.
-You have an appointment on [**2171-1-15**] 10:30am to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the [**Hospital 4695**] Clinic after a Head CT without contrast on [**2171-1-15**] 10:00am.
