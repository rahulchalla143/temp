Prenatal screens include blood type A positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and GBS status unknown.
Mother also had a prenatal screen that revealed an abnormal AFP-3 with an increased risk of trisomy-21 that was 1:73.
Apgar scores were three at one minute and eight at five minutes of life.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, birth weight was 1525 grams, which is 25th percentile, length 41 centimeters, which is 15th percentile, and head circumference was 28.25 centimeters, which is 10th percentile.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination reveals anterior fontanelle that was soft and flat, an edematous face, and intact palate, and mild micrognathia.
His breath sounds were slightly course but with good air entry bilaterally and no retractions or grunting on continuous positive airway pressure.
His pulses were two plus but his perfusion was only fair.
Genitourinary examination revealed a somewhat underdeveloped scrotum with no testes palpable bilaterally and a small but normal penis.
His skin examination revealed a few scattered petechiae on his right cheek and periauricular area.
His neurologic examination revealed decreased tone, especially in his upper extremities.
His cord blood gas revealed a pH of 7.07, pCO2 60, pO2 18.
His initial chest x-ray showed streaky hazy lung fields bilaterally and very small bilateral pleural effusions.
The pleural effusions were again seen and were small on an initial abdominal ultrasound which was performed on [**2168-12-21**], day of life two.
These had completely resolved on a repeat ultrasound on [**2168-12-28**].
Echocardiogram was normal and electrocardiogram performed the same day was normal as well.
He has had normal blood pressure and perfusion since that time and no murmur is currently evident on examination.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  On admission, Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] was acidotic with blood gases which consistently had pH in the 7.27 range with normal pCO2.
His initial Dextrostix was 40 which was treated with a 2 cc/kg bolus of D10W with a follow- up Dextrostix of 50.
Feeds were also initiated on day of life two and were advanced relatively slowly secondary to abdominal ultrasound which had revealed some ascitic fluid.
He occasionally was noted to have visible bowel loops on his abdominal examination but these were always soft and reassuring.
There was one additional period of low blood glucose that occurred on day of life four, requiring two D10 boluses but thereafter blood sugar was completely stable.
Abdominal ultrasound was performed on day of life two as part of a genetic evaluation.
The explanation for the thickened gallbladder was not evident, but repeat abdominal ultrasound one week later on [**2168-12-28**], was completely normal with resolution of the ascitic fluid, the pleural fluid and the gallbladder thickening.
Liver function tests and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were normal as well.
His discharge weight is 1775 gms, HC 31 cm, L45 cm.
Hematology:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 59000**] initial bilirubin was 4.5 at 24 hours of life.
His bilirubin peaked at 12.9.
On [**12-30**] a rebound bilirubin was 6.7/0.3.
Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 59000**] initial hematocrit was 45.8.
Infectious disease:  In light of his prematurity, respiratory distress, and nonreassuring fetal status, Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] underwent sepsis evaluation at birth.
His initial white blood cell count was 7.9 with 26 percent polys and no bands.
He had Gentamicin levels that were appropriate prior to his second dose and at 48 hours when his blood cultures were negative, antibiotics were discontinued.
He also had Parvo virus D19 titers sent which were negative.
He underwent head ultrasound screening on day of life one.
A karyotype was sent and is normal.
Genitourinary:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] was noted on his initial examination to have undescended testes.
The retroperitoneal area could not be fully evaluated so it is still possible that they are in that location.
