Admission Date:  [**2173-10-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2173-10-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2138-7-9**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Surgery, Purple Team HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 35-year-old male referred for evaluation of gastric restrictive surgery for morbid obesity.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 122/76 and pulse was 95.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination was within normal limits.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
On postoperative day three, out of concern for potential leakage due to the patient's continued fluid requirement and pain, a swallow study was obtained to evaluate the jejunostomy anastomosis.
The swallow study was read as normal with no evidence of spillage of contrast, and the contrast flowed normally in the jejunal loops.
On [**2173-10-11**], which was postoperative day three, because of continued fluid requirements and increasing pain, the patient was taken for another upper gastrointestinal study indicating air contrast levels and dilated loops of small bowel; suggestive of postoperative ileus with an unusual contour of contrast in the low-mid abdomen and large free spillage of contrast in the abdomen at the level of the proximal gastrojejunal anastomosis.
A methylene blue study was done on [**2173-10-15**] to check for evidence of continued leak.
On [**2173-10-18**], a methylene blue study was again undertaken.
He was taken for a CT to evaluate his gastric remnant with the intention being to utilize his gastrostomy tube for feeds.
The CT results indicated a patent gastric remnant without any evidence of extravasation or obstruction.
The patient had had continued spiking temperatures; however, it was felt by the surgical team to be most likely due to an abscess discovered by CT in his left upper quadrant; probably secondary to extravasation of gastric contents.
