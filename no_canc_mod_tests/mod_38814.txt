[**2117-2-19**] - Extubation and discontinuation of mechanical ventilation [**2117-2-18**] - Bedside bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage   History of Present Illness: This is a 69 year-old Female with oxygen-dependent COPD, CAD, diastolic CHF, mitral stenosis, IDDM, HTN, HLD who presented to an [**Hospital6 7472**] ED on [**2117-2-10**] with acute hypoxic respiratory failure with oxygen saturations in the 81-85% on 2L NC and hypotension.
In the OSH ED, she was found to have acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.9 (baseline 0.6).
A CXR showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.
She underwent a fiber-optic bronchscopy on [**2-13**] which showed clear tenacious secretions in the left mainstem, persistent bronchomalacia of the left mainsten, a stenosis of right middle lobe oriface.
Biopsies showed acute inflammation and revealed no malignancy.
She also underwent CT abdominal imaging on [**2117-2-10**] given her back pain complaints on admission and known cardiovascular disease, which showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and a left adrenal adenoma without AAA.
CT chest imaging showed no pulmonary embolism, no aortic dissection, but was notable for bilateral pleural effusions.
A 2D-Echo demonstrated severe mitral annular calcification with mild stenosis and regurgitation, moderate to severe pulmonary HTN (PASP 58 mmHg) with a preserved LVEF of 55%.
A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2117-2-18**] showing COPD, accessory cardiac bronchus, no focal stenosis.
Cardiac biomakers revealed a mild Troponin leak with flat CK-MBs.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (baseline on [**2-18**].5L NC with baseline saturations in the 90-93% range; has had episodes of hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation in the past) - question of bronchomalacia 2.
Congestive heart failure with preserved EF (attributed to mitral stenosis, diastolic dysfunction) 4.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF > 55%).
[**2117-2-19**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - In comparison with the study of [**2-18**], the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
However, she improved with treatment for health care associated pneumonia, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, and COPD, and did not require bronchial stenting.
#ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE/CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION/ACUTE-on-CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE/PNEUMONIA: Patient was transferred from [**Last Name (un) 91880**] Hospital following intubation for respiratory failure and concern for bronchomalacia as significant contributor (bronch there showed clear tenacious secretions in the left mainstem, persistent bronchomalacia of the left mainsten, and stenosis of right middle lobe oriface - biopsies revealed no malignancy).
A repeat 2D-Echo showed preserved EF with mild symmetric LVH and severe mitral annulus calcification but only mild mitral stenosis and 1+ MR and pulmonary HTN.
She was discharged to follow up with her Cardiologist, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Pulmonologist for f/u of her COPD, heart failure, and renal function and to assess the need for any changes to her diuretic and COPD regimen.
Consider outpatient evaluation of MR, MS, diastolic heart failure and CAD with Cardiology - no acute indications for balloon valvuloplasty at this time (prefers to see [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 91881**], MD) 2.
Patient will continue on home oxygen therapy with goal oxygen saturation of 88-93% on 2.5-3L of oxygen via nasal cannula 3.
Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommeneded and a prescription was provided 4.
Patient should have her electrolytes checked (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine and magnesium) on Tuesday, [**3-2**] - to help in determining appropriate home diuretic regimen.
She was discharged on Lasix 80mg po BID to maintain goal weight of 74kg.
Her DRY WEIGHT is estimated at 74-kg.
Please check daily weight and HOLD Lasix dose in the evening if her weight is dropping.
Vitamin C 17.
Vitamin C  Oral 16.
Outpatient Lab Work Patient should have her electrolytes checked (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine and magnesium) on Tuesday, [**3-2**] - while on aggressive diuretic therapy.
