Admission Date:  [**2152-8-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2152-9-12**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year-old woman with a complicated medical history who presented to an outside hospital on [**2152-8-2**] with complaints of lightheadedness and intermittent chest pain.
On the morning of admission to [**Hospital1 188**] the patient was reintubated with a heart rate in the 150s to 160s.
She was started on Esmolol drip with a heart rate dropping to the 120s, but the patient dropped to a systolic of the 50s.
The patient was started on a dopamine drip with a systolic blood pressure increasing to the 90s and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further management of this presumed heart failure.
At the time of admission the patient's white blood cell count was noted to be 28.1 with a bandemia.
Cultures from the outside hospital were negative, but the patient had been on multiple antibiotics broad spectrum there.
Given that the patient was hypotensive and had an increased white blood cell count and a bandemia it was assumed that the hypotension was due to sepsis, presumed pneumonia possibly due to aspiration or secondary to mechanical ventilation.
Sick sinus syndrome status post pacer placement VVI [**Company 1543**] pacer with a rate of 60.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination at that time revealed a patient who was generally obese, sedated elderly female.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 34.9, hematocrit 38.8.
The differential on the white blood cell count was 83% neutrophils, 7% bands, 4% lymphocytes.
Electrocardiogram on admission revealed atrial fibrillation, left axis deviation, left bundle branch block with occasional paced beats.
Echocardiogram at that time revealed an EF of 25 to 30% with 3+ mitral regurgitation and symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy.
Chest x-ray on admission revealed that the tip of the endotracheal tube was 3 cm into the right main stem bronchus.
Other pertinent laboratories include a CK of 238, CKMB 27, cardiac troponin of 1.03.
The cardiac enzymes later increased with a CK of 514, MB of 72 and a troponin of 3.07.
It was assumed at that time given that the patient was clinically in septic shock that the troponin increase was due to strain of the heart.
Regarding her cardiac function the CK elevation was in the sating of a high cardiac output due to likely sepsis.
The electrocardiogram with the baseline left bundle branch block and now pacer placement made it difficult to say whether or not the patient was in acute coronary syndrome.
The patient was not a good candidate for a cardiac catheterization in the context of sepsis.
Echocardiogram revealed that the ejection fraction was 20% with a hypokinetic septum and moderate symmetrical hypertrophy and 3+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient had a rhythm of chronic atrial fibrillation with a rate that varied between 60 and 100 beats per minute.
The creatinine normalized down to a level of 0.6 on the day of discharge after aggressive hydration and treatment of the underlying causes of heart failure and sepsis.
Sputum cultures grew 1+ gram negative rods.
The patient's ventilator was weaned down to 50% with a PEEP of 8.
Tube feeds were started for nutrition and the patient's hematocrit dropped from 31 to 26.
A TTE at this time revealed an EF of 20 to 30% with 3+ mitral regurgitation and apical akinesis.
After extubation the patient was cleared for eating by speech and swallow video evaluations and a diet was advanced to thick pureed foods.
Heparin was weaned off as Coumadin was started and the therapeutic INR of greater then 2 was achieved.
She was instructed to take all of her medications as described most importantly her Metoprolol 50 mg three times a day to control her heart rate and prevent flash pulmonary edema.
She was instructed to follow a 2 gram sodium diet and to limit herself to 1.5 liters of fluid each day to manage her heart failure.
She was also instructed to have daily blood pressure measurements to keep her systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg and to weigh herself daily.
Potassium chloride 20 milliequivalents once a day.
