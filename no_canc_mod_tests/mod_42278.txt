In her previous work-up she has had a negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy, negative colonoscopy and negative abdominal CT scan.
History of congestive heart failure with [**Month (only) 958**] echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 30 to 40%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Her vital signs on presentation to the Emergency Department on the [**2-9**] were temperature of 97.1 F.; heart rate of 84; blood pressure of 157/69; respiratory rate of 16 and 100% on room air.
Her rectal examination was guaiac negative.
LABORATORY:  Initial labs showed her CBC with a white blood cell count of 7.9, hematocrit of 39, and platelet count of 182.
Her Chem-7 was a sodium of 142, potassium of 5.3, chloride of 102, carbon dioxide of 26, BUN of 38; creatinine of 1.7 and glucose of 127.
She had an ALT of 20, AST of 36, alkaline phosphatase of 157 and LDH of 420, total bilirubin of 2.1.
An EKG was performed which showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with some left ventricular hypertrophy noted but no ST changes.
An abdominal CT scan was performed at the request of the Emergency Department staff on the 4th which showed a mid to distal small bowel obstruction.
On the evening of the 14th, into the morning of the [**2-20**], the patient decompensated on the floor and was found to be hypotensive into the systolic 70s to 60s, tachycardic with heart rates above 100, and tachypneic into the high 20s.
An EKG performed showed new ST elevations in V2 and V3 and although CK and CK MB were normal, her peak troponin was 0.64.
She was evaluated by Cardiology as well as the Coronary Care Unit team and was transferred to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring and treatment.
A shock assessment with a Swan-Ganz was attempted while she was in the unit, but interpretation of the numbers was made difficult by her large mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
This was problem[**Name (NI) 115**] secondary to bad mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation as well as poor ejection fraction of 20%.
However, other cardiac medicines were titrated up in order to give her good blood pressure and rate control as well as to attempt mild diuresis to remove some of the fluid given in the unit.
On the [**3-3**], the patient's white blood cell count went from 13 to 23 necessitating a search for possible source of infection.
A chest x-ray was ordered which showed no evidence of pneumonia and improved congestive heart failure pattern.
A KUB was ordered which was consistent with partial small bowel obstruction with scattered fluid levels but no free air.
Cultures were taken which were no growth to date over the first several days.
A repeat KUB showed some stool, raising concern that this was constipation versus an small bowel obstruction and she was given several enemas with some small bowel movements and passing flatus and decreasing distention as a result.
