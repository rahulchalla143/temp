[**2201-6-4**] CT chest: 1.
[**2201-6-4**] CT head: 1.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**]-weighted imaging is most sensitive for evaluation of acute infarction.
[**2201-6-4**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= XX %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-3-23**], the left ventricular dysfunction seems to be more global on the current study.
[**2201-6-10**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.
Bilateral fat- and fluid-containing inguinal hernias.
ABG 7.28/74/73.
Given his very low respiratory drive when he self-extubated on [**2201-6-7**], EMG study was done which was consistent with critical illness neuromyopathy rather than a pre-synaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission.
He failed a speech and swallow evaluation and he and his wife refused [**Name2 (NI) 282**] tube.
# Recent AAA repair, colectomy, wound infections: Pt with loculated fluid collection measuring 8x6x11 in left retroperitoneal on CT abdomen on [**6-4**], increased since [**5-15**].
Wound culture grew out corynebacterium diptheroids.
CT abd/pelvis on [**2201-6-10**] showed decreased size of fluid collection consistent with spontaneous decommpression and drainage via the incision site.
ECG unchanged from prior with no active issues or complaints.
