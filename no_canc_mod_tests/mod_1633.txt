She was tried for a first period on the cool myocardial infarction protocol but this was aborted with the finding of a severe three vessel disease with an ejection fraction of 35 percent and cardiothoracic surgery service was consulted after placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.
Her cardiac catheterization showed that she had one plus mitral regurgitation with 35 percent left ventricular ejection fraction and severe inferior, anterolateral and apical hypokinesis.
The angiography showed distal tapering of 60 to 70 percent of left main coronary artery and proximal ulceration with 90 percent stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and the left circumflex also had 90 percent ostial stenosis with 50 percent proximal stenosis of the right circumflex.
The remainder of the examination was unobtainable secondary to the patient being draped during her cardiac catheterization.
Her preoperative hematocrit was 32.0 with blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 20 and 0.8.
She remained in the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit with some respiratory issues and was noted to have decrease in oxygen saturation over the course of postoperative days number four and five at which time a chest x-ray showed moderate left pleural effusion.
Therefore, she underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2198-7-26**], to assess for any sort of bronchial plugging or lobar collapse.
Otherwise, the remainder of the patient's postoperative stay in the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit was essentially for her atrial fibrillation and maintenance of blood pressure which was somewhat labile given her conversion of rhythms and also secondary to some hypovolemia for which she was given fluid.
By postoperative day number twelve, she was off all vasopressor drips, was in sinus rhythm, was maintaining a good blood pressure and it was felt that she was safe for transfer to the floor as she was hemodynamically stable and rehabilitation screen was started.
The remainder of her hospitalization was essentially remarkable only for an episode of bradycardia to the 40s and sinus bradycardia which was thought to be secondary to a combination of her dose of Amiodarone and Lopressor.
Otherwise, there was no evidence of any ischemia subsequently on her electrocardiograms and she only had small bilateral pleural effusions which were not significantly affecting her respiratory status.
Prior to discharge, the patient's hematocrit was 30.5 and otherwise her platelet count was 419,000.
Her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 35 and 1.1.
