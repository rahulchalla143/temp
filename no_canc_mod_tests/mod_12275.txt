Chest x-ray and examination were consistent with pulmonary edema.
At the Emergency Room, the patient's blood pressure was 208/80, heart rate was 120, respiratory rate was 30 and her oxygen saturation was 96% on four liters nasal cannula.
Examination was consistent with left and right sided heart failure.
Her EKG at that time showed multifocal atrial tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 with 0.5 to [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V1, V3, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in V5 and V6.
LABORATORY:  Showed CK of 560, MB of 17, MB index is 3.0 and troponin greater than 50.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate was 66; blood pressure 154/78; respiratory rate 24; oxygen saturation of 97% on four liters.
Liver 10 cm at the right mid-clavicular line.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 12.5, hematocrit 33.5, platelets 276, 85 neutrophils, two bands, 11 lymphocytes, one monocyte, one eosinophil.
INR 1.1, PTT of 26.
Sodium 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 100, bicarbonate 23, BUN 24, creatinine 1.8, glucose 146, CK 1560, MB 17, index of 3.0, troponin greater than 50.
Urinalysis was specific gravity of 1.020, moderate blood, greater than 300 protein, [**1-31**] red blood cells, 0-2 white blood cells, 0-2 epithelial cells.
Chest x-ray bilateral hilar congestion with cephalization, bilateral pleural effusion, right lower lobe infiltrate, questionable retrocardiac opacification.
EKG with normal sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, 1.
[**Street Address(2) 18425**] elevation in V2, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V1 and V3, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression, V5 and V6, T wave flattening in III and AVF.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 70 year old female with prior history of refractory hypertension who presents with a four day history of dyspnea and evidence of [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular failure on examination with enzymes, consistent with myocardial injury in the setting of likely multi-lobar pneumonia.
When she was initially brought to the Cardiac Care Unit, she actually had blood pressure control with continuation of her Clonidine.
There was concern with her troponin greater than 50 that she had a myocardial infarction.
On the second day of admission, she had a cardiac catheterization done in the setting of congestive heart failure, elevated troponin and EKG changes suggestive of ischemia.
Prior to catheterization, she was found to be hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure up to 200.
Cardiac catheterization results were as follows:  Right atrial pressure was 25 mean, right ventricular pressure was 58/20; pulmonary artery pressure was 58/31; capillary wedge pressure was 40.
Her pressure was 173/76.
The left circumflex showed 70% ostial and proximal obtuse marginal 1 stenosis.
Right coronary artery showed 80% mid-ulcerated lesion and 70% stenosis at the posterior descending artery.
After returning from the catheterization laboratory, her blood pressure ranged from 126 to 171 systolic.
Her second CK was 406 with a CK MB of 12, and troponin of still greater than 50.
Her CK were trending downward while her troponin remained elevated.
Her third CK was 365 with an MB of 8.
Her fourth CK was 339 with a CK MB of 9.
Her creatinine was 2.1 on the second day of admission.
For her blood pressure Hydralazine was also given 10 mg times two.
Indications were to give essential intravenous agents.
Because of her stroke, her blood pressure needed further adjustment.
The Neurology Team felt that keeping her blood pressure between greater than 140 should be done, but felt that it could be less than 160.
The first atrial fibrillation occurred when getting her CT scan after her stroke.
She had further episodes of atrial fibrillation later in the day with heart rate of 130 to 160.
Blood pressure started to decrease somewhat with her atrial fibrillation with a systolic of 116.
Nitroprusside was turned off in the setting of this low systolic blood pressure and blood pressure returned to 160 to 180.
Goal blood pressure was less than 180 and greater than 140.
Chest x-ray was suggestive of bilobar pneumonia, right lower lobe and most likely left lower lobe.
A PPD was placed but the patient passed away prior the [**Location (un) 1131**] of the PPD.
She had an arterial blood gas done early in the admission which showed a pH of 7.45, carbon dioxide of 35, oxygen of 81 and bicarbonate of 25.
She was also then sent for a CT scan which showed left sided edematous changes consistent with an early ischemic event.
Her anti-coagulants were stopped at this time and her blood pressure was tried to be maintained between 140 and 180.
It was decided initially that she would have a follow-up CT scan on the following day.
First CT scan showed edematous left cerebellar hemisphere with bowing of falx and loss of grey-white matter differentiation on the left side.
Her initial creatinine prior to the catheterization was 2.1, then increased to 2.7.
They felt the increased creatinine was due to her diuresis and possibly due to her contrast exposure.
Her creatinine then increased to 2.9 on the third day of admission.
Hematologic:  The patient's initial hematocrit was 33.5.
Over the course of the admission, her hematocrit decreased to 30.6, 27.1 and then on the second day of admission it was 24.2.
A repeat hematocrit was 31.8 after the two units of packed red blood cells.
