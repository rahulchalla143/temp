Went for cardiac catherization at [**Hospital1 **] which showed three vessel coronary artery disease (100% diagonal 80% left anterior descending, and 100% right coronary artery).

[**2157-9-3**] ECHO The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
[**2157-9-15**] ECHO Conclusions: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-9-6**], the mitral prosthetic valve is new.
A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which showed mild atherosclerotic changes bilaterally with less than 40% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed his ejection fraction to be 25%, no mitral valve regurgitation and an inferior basal aneurysm.
A tagged red blood cell scan was negative for an active bleed.
A colonoscopy was notable for only diverticula and hemorrhoids.
An esophageal duodenoscopy was notable for angioectasia which was cauterized and gastritis.
On postoperative day seven, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
A repeat echocardiogram showed his ejection fraction to be 20%.
