He was also noted to have a hematocrit of 20 at the time of the "code blue".
He was placed on a heparin drip and was also placed on an epinepherine, insulin, and levophed drips at different courses of his resucitation.
Renal was consulted for acidemia and an anion gap that was thought to be due to the prolonged hypoperfusion during the resuscitation on top of his chronic renal failure.
On [**2171-6-22**] his acidemia was improving.
On [**2171-6-25**] neurology was consulted due to slow neurological improvement after cardiac arrest.
Neurology recommended an MRI which was done on [**2171-6-26**].

On [**2171-6-30**] he was noted to have pancreatitis, his tube feedings were held and his LFT's were followed.
