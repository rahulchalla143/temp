He had a cardiac echo done on [**2192-6-13**] which showed a markedly dilated left atrium, ejection fraction of 55%, moderately dilated aortic root, and severely thickened and deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Also, in comparison to a previous study in [**2191-8-15**], there was noted to be worsened aortic stenosis with a peak aortic valve gradient of 79 mmHg, with a mean aortic valve gradient of 54 mmHg, and an aortic valve area of 0.7.
He had recently prior to admission had a work-up for anemia, including a bone marrow biopsy, which revealed an anemia consistent with his HIV infection, and iron deficiency due to hemolysis from damaged cells across the aortic valve.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Heart rate 72, blood pressure 108/60.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABS ON ADMISSION:  White count 7.4, hematocrit 37%, platelet count 250,000, sodium 136, potassium 4.0, chloride 98, CO2 29, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, INR 1.0.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2192-10-11**], the patient underwent coronary angiography which showed elevated right and left heart filling pressures with severe pulmonary hypertension, severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.7 cm2, and mitral stenosis with a mitral valve area of 1 cm2.
He had 1+ mitral regurgitation, and ejection fraction of approximately 50%.
As part of the patient's preoperative work-up, he was seen by the dental service who cleared him for surgery.
The remainder of his preoperative work-up was within normal limits, and on [**2192-10-12**] he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 2 with endoscopically harvested saphenous vein graft to the OM and endoscopically harvested saphenous vein graft to the PDA.
After extubation, his Levophed was able to be weaned off, although he did require atrial pacing to keep the systolic blood pressure greater than 90.
The patient continued to progress and eventually was able to maintain a blood pressure greater than 90 without pacing, and a heart rate in the mid to upper 50s to low 60s.
On the evening of postoperative day #5, he went into a rapid atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response rate in the 150s.
He also was being given sotalol which was a preoperative medication and this was increased to 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] which was his preoperative dose.
He did remain with a heart rate in the 130s-150s throughout the overnight period despite increasing the diltiazem drip up to a maximum of 20 mg.  On postoperative day #6, the EP service was consulted, and it was planned that he would go for cardioversion on that day.
Prior to being taken to the EP Lab for cardioversion, he spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the low-60s, and this was following approximately a [**5-19**] second pause.
He has since maintained normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 66, and continues on his sotalol 120 mg [**Hospital1 **].
DISCHARGE EXAM:  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
DISCHARGE LABS:  White count 10.1, hematocrit 29.8%, potassium 4.4, blood glucose 150.
His previous electrolytes were all within normal limits.
His discharge chest x-ray shows a very small sliver of a right apical pneumothorax which has been stable for several days.
Otherwise, his chest x-ray is clear with no signs of effusion.
