She also had CHF and was diuresed until her creatinine bumped.
Per report from OSH, she had a normal echo about 6 months ago, and repeat echo in early Janurary showed new depressed EF of 30-50% with WMA.
Repeat echo on [**2168-1-14**] showed further depressed EF of 20-30%.
At [**Hospital3 **], she also had diarrhea and Cdiff cultures were negative.
Her hct dropped to 27 and because of her CHF, she was given two units of blood and her hct bumped to 31-35.

RADIOLOGY: CXR [**1-22**] IMPRESSION: Abnormal opacities involving both lungs.
These findings would be better characterized with CT examination of the chest.
ECHO [**1-22**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

CXR [**1-24**] A single portable radiograph of the chest again demonstrates an abnormal interstitial pattern involving both lungs with relative sparing of the left upper lung, similar to [**2168-1-22**].
Lung volumes are low normal.
CXR [**1-25**] IMPRESSION: No significant change in findings suspicious for pulmonary fibrosis.
REPEAT TEE [**1-27**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-1-23**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly worse and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 106627**] is a 78 year-old female with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was transferred from an outside hospital for workup for new cardiomyopathy (LVEF 20%), and was found to have a submassive pulmonary embolism, transferred to the CCU for haemodynamic monitoring.
Discharged on heparin gtt sliding scale as a bridge to warfarin treatment with higher INR goal, 2.5-3.
Renal u/s negative for renal mass, thrombus.
Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%.
Unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**].
Lung Infiltrates: Patient's infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
Continue heparin for AC as bridge to Coumadin resumed, goal INR 2.5-3.0 as above.
Stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P all negative.
Prelim stool studies have fecal leukocytes.
