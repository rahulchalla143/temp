Admission Date:  [**2126-3-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2126-3-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2049-4-13**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 76 year old female who was referred to Dr. [**Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of critical aortic stenosis.
An echocardiogram obtained at that time demonstrated a normal left ventricular chamber size with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and impaired relaxation with preserved systolic function and moderate aortic stenosis, with a mean gradient of 22 millimeters of Mercury and mild aortic insufficiency with trace to mild mitral regurgitation and a dilated left atrium and ascending aorta.
The patient underwent an exercise test in [**2119-12-30**] which demonstrated no evidence of ischemic changes and heart rate at 60% of predicted maximum at six minutes on [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.
A repeat echocardiogram obtained in [**2123-12-30**] demonstrated an aortic valve with a mean gradient of 26 millimeters of Mercury and two plus aortic insufficiency which did not appear significantly changed from her [**2121**] study.
The patient underwent cardiac consultation on [**2126-3-7**], which concluded a cardiac catheterization notable for moderate disease of the mid- left anterior descending with mild disease of the circumflex and right coronary arteries.
In addition, the study demonstrated a mildly dilated proximal ascending aorta with what appeared to be a trileaflet aortic valve with significant restriction of systolic opening along with two plus aortic insufficiency.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and had a cross clamp time of 108 minutes and a bypass time of 131 minutes.
The patient's pericardium was left open, lines placed including arterial lines and a Swan-Ganz catheter; wires placed included both ventricular and atrial wires.
Evaluation by Physical Therapy suggested the patient was an adequate candidate for short term rehabilitation following discharge and the patient was subsequently screened by extended care facilities for post-discharge care.
