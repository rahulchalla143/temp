Renal cath ([**2112-8-4**]): 95% right renal artery in-stent restenosis.
Active extravasation seen in the course of this exam though not accumulating at a very brisk rate.
Pt was started on daily diuretic therapy since she seemed to consistently develop LE edema & basilar crackles on lung exam when not recieving diuretics.
Her blood pressure was initially treated in the CCU with a nitro drip.
After trying numerous combinations the following meds seemed to control her pressure adequately: labetolol, hydralazine, nifedipine, and clonidine (initially PO then patch).
Post-renal artery cath, the pt's renal function became progressively worse, peaking at a creatinine of 5.7.
After dialysis, her Crt began to trend downward, leveling off at 2.7.
Her urine output improved after dialysis, though it was still low.
The urine culture revealed pan-sensitive E. coli.
Repeat urine culture revealed no growth.
On, [**2112-8-18**], WBC=12.9.
If WBC continues to rise, she may need a repeat UCx.
Overtime, her Hct improved, and the sub-capsular hematoma was found to be stable on repeat imaging.
She underwent lower extremity ultra-sound which was negative for DVT.
