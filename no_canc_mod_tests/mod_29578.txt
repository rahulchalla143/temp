HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE/ HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA- Mr. [**Known lastname 14879**] was intubated in the Emergency department on [**2170-10-30**] due to increased work of breathing and a respiratory rate of 40.
He was also pan-cultured and sputum cultures returned positive for multi-drug resistant klebsiella pneumonia.
Initially he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin and aztreonam (due to his many drug allergies), but when cultures and sensitivities returned he was switched to meropenem on [**2170-11-2**].
Coumadin was restarted on [**2170-11-5**] in the setting of INR 1.8.
ANEMIA: Between [**2170-11-3**] and [**2170-11-4**], the patient had a hematocrit drop from 26.0 to 22.8 in the setting of trace guaiac positive stool.
He was continued on the meropenem for his pneumonia while in the hospital, but discharged on ertapenem (for ease of administration) for a total coverage of 14 days.
Coagulopathy Patient was subtherapeutic when he arrived on the floor with an INR of 1.3.
He was continued on his home dose of 5mg coumadin with improvement in his INR to 1.7 on day of discharge.
He was not bridged on heparin gtt as his PE was remote and given recent concern for bleed.
His INR will be followed at the extended care facility where he will be transferred.
His pressures were stable and within the normal range on his home blood pressure regimen on the floor.
Anemia Patient's hematocrit was stable during his time on the [**Hospital1 **].

Your INR was elevated when you came into the hospital and we stopped your coumadin.
You will need to continue to have your INR checked and your coumadin adjusted accordingly to maintain a therapeutic INR.
Your hematocrit improved appropriately and remained stable throughout the duration of your stay in the hospital.
