Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the basal to mid inferior wall .
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-19**], the overall LVEF is similar and the degree of mitral regurgitation appears slightly less.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include akinetic basal inferior which is also aneurysmal; mid and apical anteroseptal and anterior hypokinetic walls; basal inferoseptal hypokinetic wall.
Evaluation by color flow doppler (vena contracta 4-5mm), pulmonary venous inflow (no systolic reversal or blunting of pulmonary veins of both sides), mitral annulus (30mm), dilated left atrium (4.7cm) and normal sized left ventricle in diastole (5.6 cm), a central regurgitant jet is visualized which is consistent with moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation under anesthesia and with provocative measures like trendelenburg position.
LVEF 40% with epinephrine running at 0.05mcg/kg/min.
This was in the setting of cardiac catheterization with stenting.
Cardiology was [**Date Range 4221**] upon admission for pre-operative planning and a preoperative echo was obtained.
Her coumadin was titrated for her target INR of 2.0-2.5.
The [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes service continued to adjust her diabetes medications to ontain tight control of her blood suagrs.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): adjust dosage based on INR goal 2.0-2.5 .
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 ml IV DAILY:PRN Peripheral IV - Inspect site every shift 10.
