The patient refused Dobbhoff tube placement, and requested that a [**Month/Year (2) 282**] be placed.
A [**Month/Year (2) 282**] was placed on [**2115-7-5**].
and they felt his EKG was at baseline and not concerning.
He had a head CT which showed "No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities, but air in the masticator spaces."
CXR showed R PNA so he was given vanc and levofloxacin.
Abd CT showed distended gallbladder and bilateral pleural effusions.
RUQ U/S showed distended gallbladder with thickened wall and sludge, concerning for acute cholecystitis.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast and oral contrast.
FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN: There are at least moderate bilateral pleural effusions, which are unchanged in size since the prior study.
The spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, abdominal loops of bowel are within normal limits.
CT PELVIS: The prostate is grossly unremarkable.
Large bilateral pleural effusions, which appear stable since the [**7-7**], [**2114**] study.
Somewhat featureless and minimally thickened appearance of the rectum, similar to the prior study from [**2115-7-7**], may be related to chronic or acute colitis, though underdistention and third-spacing is a possibility.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

He had a Head CT that was negative for acute process.
His somnolence was thought to be from systemic infection given the patient was not on sedating medications, EKG appeared baseline, and there were no gross electrolyte abnormalities.
Sources of infection were presumed initially to be pneumonia within stable right pleural effusion and/or cholecystitis given CT abdomen that showed distended gall bladder and RUQ U/S that confrimed distended gallbladder containing sludge.
UA and blood cultures were negative.
Surgery was consulted and did not think the patient had cholecystitis given his CT abdomen looked similar to CT from [**7-7**] and thought the findings could be due to lack of PO intake on TPN.
They recommended HIDA scan which was inconclusive.
The patient's abdominal exam remained stable and he was not felt to have had cholecystitis.
The patient did not exhibit septic physiology and did not require IV fluids or pressors to maintain urine output and blood pressure.
Sputum was sent for culture and grew sensation gram negative rods, and he was switched to Ceftriaxone on [**7-17**] and finished an 8 day course.
# Pleural Effusions: The patient was noted to have a right sided pleural effusion which had been present on chest x rays seince [**2114-9-17**].
His ABG did not indicate he had a large A-a gradient.
His electrolytes should be checked on [**7-27**] to ensure stability and assess need for replacement.
