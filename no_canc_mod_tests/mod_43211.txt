NIHSS was 6.
Renal whise, pt has ESRD and was on HD 3x/week.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension  2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -PCI: - [**2196**]: Cypher x 2 to left circumflex - [**2198**]: Cypher to LAD after NSTEMI - [**9-/2203**]: catheterization w/ known occluded RCA, 90% mid LAD intervened on w/ BMS, minimal LCX - [**12/2204**]: Found to have LAD and LCx disease with placement of DES to ostial LCX, DES to LAD 3.
Registers [**3-24**] objects, recalls [**1-24**] with prompting after 5 minutes.
-Coordination: patient did not agree to cooperate with FTN, said she was tired -Gait: deferred  Physical Exam on Discharge: Expired  Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2204-8-15**] 07:10PM   WBC-14.2*# RBC-4.07*# HGB-12.6# HCT-39.6# MCV-97 MCH-31.0 MCHC-31.9 RDW-16.0* [**2204-8-15**] 07:10PM   CALCIUM-10.3 PHOSPHATE-5.2* MAGNESIUM-2.2 [**2204-8-15**] 07:10PM   GLUCOSE-87 UREA N-16 CREAT-3.9*# SODIUM-145 POTASSIUM-4.7 CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-22*  Relevant labs: [**2204-8-16**] 04:35AM BLOOD PT-23.7* PTT-39.0* INR(PT)-2.3* [**2204-8-17**] 04:50AM BLOOD PT-94.1* PTT-46.7* INR(PT)-9.6* [**2204-8-17**] 08:04AM BLOOD PT-79.3* PTT-47.9* INR(PT)-8.0* [**2204-8-17**] 04:50AM BLOOD ALT-8 AST-12 AlkPhos-62 TotBili-0.2 [**2204-8-18**] 04:25AM BLOOD WBC-10.9 RBC-3.53* Hgb-10.7* Hct-34.4* MCV-97 MCH-30.3 MCHC-31.1 RDW-16.1* Plt Ct-170  Labs on Discharge: *****************  Imaging: Studies at OSH: -Chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema.
Head CT revealed no evidence of acute infarction; however, clinical indication with MRI was recommended.
-Brain MRI with MRA revealed acute infarction in the left anterior cerebral artery territory with a small discontinuous focus of infarction in the left posterior body at all lobes with associated blood products indicating focal hemorrhagic transformation.
Neck MRA was a motion limited study with questionable filling defects in the proximal right and left internal carotid arteries.
Studies [**Hospital1 18**]:  CTA head/neck 1.
No intracranial thrombus visualized on the head CT angiogram.
Chest X-ray FINDINGS:  Dialysis catheter noted and unchanged.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with extensive regional wall motion abnormalities as outlined on the chart (LVEF = 25%).
Chest x-ray [**8-25**]  An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1728**] is a 72 yo RH woman with history of CHF (EF 30%), afib on Coumadin, ESRD on HD (now daily), DM II, HL, HTN, COPD who initially presented to BIDN where she was found to have a L ACA infarct and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of b/l carotid stenoses (s/p L ICA stent) for CEA vs. angioplasty.
However, as below, on HD 2, INR was elevated to 9.6, then repeat to 8.
She was restarted on warfarin on [**8-18**] as INR was < 2.
The goal for her blood pressure neeeds to be systolically 120-160 given her high degree of carotid artery stenosis.
EEG on [**8-22**] encephalopathy generalized slowing but somewhat improved from day prior.
# Cardio: -Chronic systolic congestive heart failure with LVEF 30%.
She was on lasix at home, but it was discontinued while at [**Hospital1 18**] given patient's blood pressure was persistently between 90-120 and on dialysis.
While in [**Hospital1 18**], patient had a couple episode of atypical chest pain at rest (right upper back, similar to prior CAD per patient) which may be her unstable angina, serial EKGs were stable in nature.
Per cardiology c/s, pt started on heparin drip x48 hrs and amiodarone x24 hours.
She also required 2 pressors (phenylephrine and norepinephrine) - hypotension in setting of propofol and CVVH.
CTX was discontinued on [**8-18**] when repeat urine culture returned to have mixed flora and when her leukocytosis resolved.
Chest x-ray with focal consolidation during ICU stay, suspicious VAP.
Her INR returned to 1.8 on [**8-18**] and she was reinitiated on warfarin at home dose.
After intubation, she would get agitated with attempt to wean her off the vent and could not be extubated.
Information was obtained from PatientFamily/Caregiver.
