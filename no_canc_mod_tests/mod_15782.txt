The patient had a positive stress test, but refused cardiac catheterization at that time.
He had a positive stress test and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed a 50% left main lesion, 70% left anterior descending artery lesion, small circumflex lesion, and an 80% right coronary artery lesion.
He had an ejection fraction of 60%.
This procedure was complicated by a retroperitoneal bleed, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for a coronary artery bypass graft.
Status post transient ischemic attack three weeks ago and with a head CT scan which revealed an old lacunar infarct adjacent to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
History of carotid disease, the left is 100% occluded, the right has a 50% occlusion.
HEENT examination is normocephalic, atraumatic.
Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.
Pulses were 2+ and equal bilaterally throughout with bilateral carotid bruits.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal with equal strength bilaterally and sensation intact.
He underwent a MRI which revealed a left ICA/MCA watershed infarct.
As long as his systolic blood pressure remained above 120, the patient's symptoms dissipated.
He remained in the CSRU because he required Neo to keep his blood pressure in the desired range.
He was followed by Neurology and they wanted to obtain an angiogram to fully assess his left carotids.
His MRA revealed what appeared to be a string sign intracranially.
He continued to progress but remained on Neo and he did have an angiogram, but it was an incomplete study and they were unable to ascertain the status of his left ICA occlusion, but they still felt it was fully occluded.
Following this, his blood pressure did improve and eventually he was weaned off the neo and transferred back to the floor on postoperative day #17.
His laboratories on discharge:  Hematocrit 35.7, white count 7,400, platelets 363.
Sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 99, CO2 26, BUN 16, creatinine 1.1, blood sugar 91.
INR was 1.6.
