CXR ([**2120-8-10**]): LLL effusion .
ECHO: EF 40% LVH, LAD, mild MR, no new WMA .
Fe panel: Fe-14 calTIBC: 155  Ferritn: 1431  TRF: 119 UA- positive (17WBC, 800+ RBCs, pos leuk est) Urine and blood cultures negative.
TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: Initial MDCT axial images through the abdomen were obtained for guidance for this patient's drainage.
Further evaluation with MRI could be performed when feasible.
For his cholecystitis with ascending cholangitis: Pt was admitted from OSH after an extensive negative GI workup for RUQ pain on Unasyn, admitted after clearance of NSTEMI, for ERCP emergently.
Exploratory ECRP demonstrated gross pus in the stomach and spilling from the papilla, and a biliary stent was placed.
Amylase and lipase rose transiently suggestive of post ERCP pancreatitis but trended downwards by POD2.
Acute on chronic renal failure: He presented in prerenal ARF with Cr ~6, with likely component of oliguric ATN [**1-27**] CHF with kidney hypoperfusion.
Blood cx were negative.
Urine cx were positive (already covered with zosyn).
Troponins were elevated from OSH on heparin gtt, peaking at trop 2.19 on ICU day 6 ([**2120-8-12**]).
ECG showed sinus rhythm, RBBB with ST depressions in V2-V4 and terminal deflection in qrs but not significantly changed from prior tracings.
ECHO showed EF 40% which is unchanged from prior, mild-moderate systolic dysfunction, symmetric LVH, and mild MR. Pt was started on Asa and metoprolol, and restarted on an ACE inhibitor.
Anemia: normocytic Hct 30 down from baseline of 37-40, likely related to CKD, Fe deficiency given hx of GIB with possible malnutrition.
His hematocrit remained stable for the rest of his hospital stay.
CHF: ECHO from [**2115**] shows EF 50%, with inferior basal hypokinesis and the ECHO obtained in the ICU did not show interval development of wall mortion abnormalities.
