Prior to the day of admission, the daily chest pain was responsive to 3 to 10 sublingual nitroglycerin per day, but over the last 24 hours his chest pain has been refractory to nitroglycerin and so he decided to come in.
There was a plan for an outpatient ETT and possible catheter pending those results.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for any orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
His electrocardiogram showed no acute changes.
His chest pain was not responsive to three sublingual nitroglycerin, but it completely resolved with 2 mg of morphine.
Most recent stress MIBI done in [**2151-4-22**] showed ischemia in the inferolateral region.
History of pancreatitis during his admission in [**Location (un) **] for his cardiac catheterization 6.
Blood pressure 117/78, heart rate of 52, respiratory rate 18, saturating 97%.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The PT pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
ADMISSION LABS:  White count of 7.2, hematocrit of 47.3, MCV of 88, platelets of 173, PT of 12.4, INR 1.1, PTT of 25.
Sodium of 144, potassium of 4.0, chloride of 110, bicarbonate of 24, BUN of 19, creatinine of 1.0, glucose of 113, CK of 130, MB of 3, troponin less than 0.3.
Electrocardiogram - most recent cholesterol in [**2153-4-21**] showed total cholesterol of 169, LDL of 102, HDL of 48.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 51 beats per minute with normal axis and normal intervals, except for slight prolongation of the QRS at 124 milliseconds.
There was concern for possible in stent restenosis given the patient's recent cardiac catheterization in [**2152-10-21**].
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was admitted as already stated and his cardiac enzymes were cycled.
Over the first 24 hours, the patient's CKs remained flat at 130 to 125 to 156, however the MB fraction went from3 to 6 to 9.
Initially, it was unclear whether the patient did have unstable angina or not given that his enzymes were not positive and his initial troponin was less than 0.3 despite over one day of chest pain at home unresponsive to nitroglycerin.
A repeat troponin on the second hospital day came back positive at 4.4.
At that time, cardiology was consulted for cardiac catheterization given the fact that the evidence was now showing the patient was having unstable angina.
Cardiology saw the patient in the morning and recommended that the patient undergo cardiac catheterization that same day.
The hope was that his family could convince him to undergo cardiac catheterization and the medications would help protect against further cardiac damage.
The patient was chest pain free with the above interventions, however his platelets dropped after being on the Integrilin drip for 24 hours and therefore the Integrilin had to be discontinued.
The importance of cardiac catheterization was again stressed with the patient and his daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**] and he finally agreed to go to cardiac catheterization.
However, the patient did suffer an acute anterior myocardial infarction prior to catheterization with his CK peaking at 1334.
His electrocardiogram evolved with eventual development of Qs in leads V2 through V6.
However, two days after cardiac catheterization the patient was found to be unresponsive to voice, tactile or noxious stimuli.
An emergent head CT was performed (an MRI could not be performed given the patient's pacemaker as well as recent stent placement) and it showed no evidence of a bleed, but possible new stroke in the thalamic region.
From a cardiac standpoint, the patient has been stable following his catheterization.
His blood pressure goal at this point is around a systolic of 120.
He had an echocardiogram performed after his cardiac catheterization and acute myocardial infarction and his ejection fraction was found to be down to only 25%.
Neurologic exam immediately after the event showed the patient to have no eye opening.
As already stated, his blood pressure was initially run higher or attempted to be run higher at greater than 140 by holding his blood pressure medications.
Despite holding his blood pressure medications however, his blood pressure was never above the 120 to 130 range.
His exam was followed closely.
Most recent neurologic exam performed with an interpreter shows the patient to be somnolent, but arousable to loud stimuli.
At the time of this discharge summary, we are repeating a head CT to evaluate extent of the stroke and we are starting low dose methylphenidate at 5 mg to see if this will help with the patient's attention and arousability.
At the time of this discharge summary, the patient's blood pressure has been allowed to be lower, given that it has been approximately one week since the event.
His platelets, which had dropped when he was on the 2B3A have recovered.
His most recent hematocrit was 41.9 with most platelets of 246.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient is on ProMod with fiber at 75 cc an hour with 200 cc free water boluses 4x daily.
Captopril 6.25 mg po tid, holding for systolic blood pressure less than 110 2.
Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid, holding for systolic pressure less than 110 and heart rate less tan 55.
Coumadin dose to be determined with an INR goal of 2 to 3 13.
