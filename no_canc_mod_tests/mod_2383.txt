BRAIN MRI [**11-15**]: Bilateral acute anterior cerebral artery territorial infarcts and also infarct involving the left posterior cerebral artery involving the occipital lobe.
MRA OF THE NECK [**11-15**]: No vascular occlusion or high-grade stenosis on MRA of the neck.
MRA OF THE HEAD [**11-15**]: Normal MRA of the head  CT Head [**11-17**]: Large areas of hypodensity are seen in the bilateral anterior cerebral artery vascular territories.
There are air-fluid levels seen in the sphenoid sinus and bilateral maxillary sinuses.
Echo [**11-18**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 13653**] was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her bilateral ACA and left PCA infarcts.
She was allowed to autoregulate her BP between 220/105 and 120/90 and was treated with a Nicardipine drip PRN.
She had a repeat head CT on [**11-17**] which was unchanged.
An echo was also done to look for an intracardiac source of infarct.
She was admitted with rhabdomyolysis and her CK peaked above 10,000.
She was treated with IVF and her Cr did not rise.
A CXR was done which showed some R hilar consolidation and as she had a leukocytosis on admission she was treated with levofloxacin.
