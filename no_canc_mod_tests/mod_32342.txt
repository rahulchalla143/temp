Of note, between the outside hospital and admission, the hematocrit dropped from 41-29. she received 2 units of FFP.
PTT was elevated for unclear reasons to over 100.

An area of hypodensity along the right temporal/occipital lobe likely represents a late subacute infarct, unchanged.
[**2191-8-30**] CT CHEST: The right lung demonstrates a large pleural effusion.
A dual- lead  intraventricular pacemaker is noted with its leads overlying the right ventricle and right atrium.
The intra- abdominal loops of large and small bowel are grossly unremarkable without evidence of free fluid, free air, or pneumatosis.
CT PELVIS: The rectum, uterus and adnexa are grossly unremarkable except to note calcifications in the uterus which may represent calcified fibroids.
Dedicated chest CT when the patient is clinically stable is recommended for further evaluation.
If these studies are not available, then MRCP is recommended when the patient is clinically stable.

Normal IVC diameter (<2.1cm) with >55% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (0-5mmHg).
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
This fluid was sent for analysis, revealing a transudative effusion.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Doxycycline pleurodesis was performed on [**9-6**] and was successful; her CT was pulled on [**9-8**].
A Speech and Swallow evaluation was done at bedside; her diet was advanced to ground solids with thin liquids; aspiration precautions should be observed.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) ML's PO BID (2 times a day).
Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): hold for HR <60; SBP <110.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Inform the office that you will need a repeat head CT scan for this appointment.
