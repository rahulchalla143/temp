She underwent further evaluation which included echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization.
Echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation with bileaflet mitral valve prolapse and partial P3 flail.
Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries.
The ECG demonstrated high grade heart block and accelerated junctional rhythm at the time.
Over several days, heart rate improved and low dose beta blockade was resumed.
Warfarin was eventually resumed for history of atrial fibrillation and dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5.
