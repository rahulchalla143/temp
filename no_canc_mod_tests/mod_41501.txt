He also had a RUQ ultrasound that showed a contracted gallbladder with small stones and a thickened wall.
A challenging and lengthy dissection ensued, requiring extensive stripping of omental adhesions as well as adhesions between the gallbladder and liver bed.
On [**6-17**], transaminases were noted to be elevated with AST 148, ALT 245, Tbili 1.4, Dbili 0.3.
A sphincterotomy was performed and several stones were extricated.
Cholangiogram did not demonstrate filling of the right and left hepatic ducts and subsequently there was extraluminal contrast outside of the CBD and intestine concern for bile leak.

**FINAL REPORT [**2201-6-19**]** URINE CULTURE (Final [**2201-6-19**]):    NO GROWTH.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification of the distal common bile duct.
Filling of contrast was noted in the distal bile duct.
On [**2201-6-18**], the patient underwent abdominal CTA, which demonstrated post-cholecystectomy changes with drain and surrounding stranding without focal fluid collection to suggest biliary leak or hematoma; the right hepatic artery is not well seen and interruption/occlusion was suspected.
On [**2201-6-21**] patient underwent MRCP, during which common hepatic duct was not identified throughout its length.
The patient's pulmonary function was continued to improve; vital signs were routinely monitored.
The patient's electrolytes were checked daily and repleted when necessary.
The patient's LFTs were stable and he was discharged home on regular low fat diet.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
