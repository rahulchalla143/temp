Her usual vent settings are SIMV, respiratory rate of 8, tidal volume of 500, pressure support of 15, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 0.3.
Two saturations decreased to 90%.
Arterial blood gas was 7.23/70/123/30/96%.
Breath sounds were noted to be distant and chest x-ray could not be obtained for a significant period so she was sent to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation.
The patient's symptoms improved and she was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for further evaluation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were 98.8, heart rate 82, blood pressure 92/47, respiratory rate 18, 100% bagged.
Neurological:  The patient was able to move all extremities, decreased hearing and unable to communicate or take p.o.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count 18.2, hematocrit 36.4, platelet count 425, and 87.5, no bands.
Sodium 132, BUN 49, creatinine 1.1, glucose 231.
Urinalysis had large blood, greater than 50 white blood cells, [**12-5**] red blood cells, nitrite negative, leukocyte esterase moderate.
The patient had follow-up chest x-ray which demonstrated right middle lobe pneumonia and question of pneumonia at the left base.
The patient was then put back on her [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital ventilator settings and her white count decreased.
Sputum culture showed greater than 25 polys, less than 10 epithelial cells with mixed flora and final culture is pending at the time of this dictation.
She underwent transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate her ejection fraction given possible congestive heart failure.
This demonstrated left atrium with moderate dilatation, right atrium with moderate dilatation, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, minimal aortic stenosis, 1+ aortic regurgitation, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, impaired ventricular relaxation.
She underwent CT scan of the head which demonstrated no acute changes but chronic microvascular changes and atherosclerosis of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries.
Blood count is stable at the time of her discharge.
Should her hematocrit decreased to less than 24, blood transfusion may be of benefit to her.
