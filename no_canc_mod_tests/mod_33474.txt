CT obtained at OSH c/w SDH and SAH.
Sensation: Withdraws to noxious stimulation bilaterally Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Normal bilaterally   Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2140-7-16**] 1.
An urgent head CTA or conventional angiogram is recommended.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2140-7-16**] Technically limited head CTA.
Since a small aneurysm may be obscured or compress subarachnoid hemorrhage, a conventional cerebral angiogram should be considered  [**2140-7-16**] Angiogram: negative for any aneurysm or vascular malformation  [**2140-7-17**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Minimal progression of interhemispheric hematoma along with a small subdural hematoma along the falx.
The EEG showed a slow and mildly disorganized background throughout with intermittent delta slowing in a generalized distribution.
[**2140-7-20**] CTA Head: IMPRESSION 1.
It indicated a widespread encephalopathy.
[**2140-7-22**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST  There is no new hemorrhage seen or evidence of infarct.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
The background showed the same mild to moderate encephalopathy throughout.
She was convinced by her family to go to OSH where a head CT was done which revealed a SDH and SAH.
On examination at OSH, patient reported occipital headache, but was otherwise nonfocal.
Due to the appearance and location of hemorrhage, a CTA was done to evaluate for aneurysm or AVM.
On [**7-17**], exam remained the same.
Her NA levels were decreasing, she was started on salt tabs and NA level improved.
A repeat head CT was done which showed improvement of the hemorrhage and stable ventricle size.
Labs Repeat CTA was unchanged and negative for aneurysm.
Repeat TCD on [**7-19**] showed normal flow in bilateral MCA's.
UA and culture were positive for E. coli UTI and she was started on Ceftriaxone.
Other labs including TSH, B12, and Depakote level were normal.
EEG showed diffuse slowing without evidence for epileptiform activity.
On [**7-20**] a repeat Head CTA was negative for vasospasm.
There was concern as her exam had differed as she was less interactive and she was not moving her LUE.
Hypertonic Saline 3% was started at 20 cc/hr and her SBP was pushed 160-180.
The next day on [**7-21**] her exam was slightly improved as she gave "no/yes" answers.
On [**7-22**] her exam once again varied and a repeat Head CT was stable.
She stablized on exam but mental status was not improving.
Labs revealed normal BMG, elevated LFT's, normal ammonia, negative UA.
Sodium normalized on 3% saline and she was transitioned to salt tabs TID.
EEG again showed diffuse slowing with no epileptiform activity.
MRI was unremarkable, demonstrating stable intracranial hemorrhage and ventricular prominence.
Serial PO trials were performed but she was unable to maintain adequate PO intake to meet her nutritional needs.
The serum sodium level is low but stable at 131.
The patient's serum magnesium level was low at 1.5 and she was given magnesium for repleation.
Her Sodium should be checked daily for the next 2 to three days.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush Temporary Central Access-ICU: Flush with 10mL Normal Saline daily and PRN.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
