There was approximately fifteen minutes between the time of collapse and the time pulse was restored per the outside observers.
Her vitals at that time were HR 88 and NSR, BP 122/59, RR 19, and O2 Sat of 99% on 100% bag valve mask.
Right heart catheterization showed elevated right and left filling pressures.

Post-angiography hemodynamics showed mild-moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension at 50/233 mmHg.
A moderate elevation of right atrial at 20 mmHg and capillary wedge pressure at 20 mmHg was noted.
Cardiac index was high at 4.2 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption).
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Non-Contrast CT Head: Technically limited study.
Cardiac MRI on [**2137-9-5**]: These results were pending at time of discharge Impression: 1.
She also received amiodarone and aspirin before tranfer to the cath lab where cardiac catheterization revealed basically unremarkable coronary arteries.
After cath she was transferred to the CCU where she was started on an amiodarone drip as well as heparin drip due to concern about a new RBBB pattern with possible S1Q3T3 pattern on EKG raised concern for acute PE.
TTE on the day of admission showed EF 25% with biventricular hypokinesis, normal valves, and normal septal thickness but no signs of right heart strain.
Cardiac MRI was also obtained to look for an arrythmogenic scar or ARVD, but the results of this study weren't available at discharge.
2) Coronary artery disease: The patient had a cardiac catheterization soon after arrival, which showed no flow limiting coronary artery disease.
EF was estimated at 25%.
As noted above, cardiac catheterization showed no significant disease basically eliminating ischemic cardiomyopathy as a possibility.
The most common metabolic cardiomyopathies were ruled out by normal TSH and iron studies and syphillis, though always thought unlikely, was basically excluded with negative RPR.
The patient did have a cardiac MRI to evaluate for subtle structural disease, but the results of this study were still pending at the time of discharge.
The patient will follow-up in cardiology for the results of her MRI as well as repeat echocardiograms and further management of her cardiac disease.
She also had a CT head without contrast to evaluate for acute intracranial process given the lack of a clear etiology for her collapse and concern for an acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CT was negative for acute intracranial process.
Soon after her CT scan, the patient became considerably more active and began following some commands and moving all her extremities vigorously.
Repeat emesis was less notably bloody and after a small further drop on the day after admission serial hematocrits rematined stable around 30.
Given anemia her vitamin B12 and folate levels were checked and were normal though her reticulocyte index was mildly decreased.
6) Renal: On admission catheterized urine specimen revealed increased RBC and WBC counts with moderate bacteria.
She was empirically started on ciprofloxacin until repeat UA was benign and initial culture was negative.
We did tests that showed your heart is weak, but it is unclear if this caused your cardiac arrest or is simply a result of poor blood flow to the heart during the arrest.
Your new medications are- -Metoprolol Succinate: to slow your heart rate down so it can pump more blood -Lisinopril: to decrease your blood pressure and make it easier for your heart to pump.
