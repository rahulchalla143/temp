The patient's neurologic examination remained unchanged for the remainder of the hospitalization with minimal sensation in the left later foot, minimal voluntary movement below the left ankle, and pain on passive movement.
A hip/pelvic CAT scan from [**8-5**], on re-read, demonstrated swelling and potential fluid collection in the region of the left piriformis.
With concern for potential piriformis syndrome, the Pain Service was consulted for evaluation and potential injection.
A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis and left hip was obtained on [**8-21**] which again demonstrated swelling in the region of the piriformis, however, decreased swelling since prior CAT scan.
The study also demonstrated persistent collection in the left gluteus medias consistent with myonecrosis and fibrosis with normal sacral roots.
Given the patient's general sense of fatigue, the patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 27.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable at greater than 30 for the remainder of the hospitalization with an appropriate reticulocyte count.
The patient was diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis and treated with a 10-day course of oral Flagyl with complete resolution of both diarrhea, fever, and white blood cell count.
Rhabdomyolysis 3.
