COMPARISON: Chest radiographs from [**2177-2-9**] and [**2177-2-8**].
This was followed by a CTA of the head and neck after the administration of 75 cc of Optiray IV contrast.
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to MRA of the neck from [**2177-2-4**] as well as MR of the head from [**2177-2-3**] and a head CT from [**2177-2-3**].
RADIOLOGIST: The study was read by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4685**] [**Name (STitle) 4686**].
TECHNIQUE: Evaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries was performed with B-mode, color and spectral Doppler ultrasound.
Peak systolic velocities on the right side were 92 cm/sec for the internal carotid artery, 60 cm/sec for the common carotid artery and 95 cm/sec for the external carotid artery.
Peak systolic velocities on the left were 441 cm/sec for the ICA, 66 cm/sec for the CCA and 70 cm/sec for the ECA.
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2177-2-5**]    PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Cerebrovascular event/TIA.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 5.1 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.1 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 2.9 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.1 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.9 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.29  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 1 iv injection of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline at rest.
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Conclusions: Technically suboptimal study due to very poor echo windows.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are grossly normal (LVEF>55%).
She underwent CT imaging to assess injuries; there were no intracranial or intraabdominal injuries identified.
It was recommended that she be placed on Heparin drip as a bridge and placed on Coumadin with goal INR [**3-8**]; her most recent INR was 1.3.
Orthopedic spine surgery was also consulted because of a R C4-5 and C5-6 foraminal stenosis (mod-severe); there was no operative intervention, it was suggested to continue to follow her exam, which remained intact during her hospital stay.
A bedside swallow evaluation from Speech Language Pathology was done along with a video swallow.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): hold for HR <60 and SBP <110.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): dose needs to be adjusted daily to maintain INR [**3-8**].
