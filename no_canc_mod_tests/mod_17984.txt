TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2, susceptibility, and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained.
Correlation was made with the head CT examination of [**2147-6-24**].
The abnormality suspected on CT in the right frontal lobe demonstrates hyperintensity both on diffusion and ADC map which is indicative of edema which could be related to contusion.
The abnormality seen on CT of [**2147-6-24**] in the right frontal lobe demonstrates no evidence of slow diffusion and corresponds to a hemorrhagic contusion.

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2, and inversion-recovery sagittal and gradient-echo and T2 axial images of the cervical spine were acquired.
At C5-6, mild anterolisthesis of C5 over C6 is identified.
On the CT images at this level, mild irregularity of the articular surface and mild osteophyte formation is seen indicative of degenerative change.
No definite fracture is seen on CT in this location.
Lung volumes are low, but the lungs are clear.

Comparison made to prior study dated [**2147-6-23**].
CT ABDOMEN: There are patchy and linear airspace opacities at the lung bases, most consistent with atelectasis, as was present on previous examination.

After initial eval and review of CT scan - pt was taken emergently to the OR for right craniotomy and evacuation of SDH for impending brain herniation.
Post operative scans showed improvment with evacuation of hemorrhag.
MRI of brain demonstrated Right PCA infarct.
MRI of the c-spine was negative for ligamentous injury or cord contusion.
Following the first event keppra was added with goal dilantin 15-20, according to Neurology team recommendations.An EEG showed a slower than average background consistent with a mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic or anoxic etiology and no evidence of ongoing seizures.
Neurology consultation was obtained for PCA infarct also and blood pressure goal of 130 recommended to minimise extension of infarct.
MRV of the brain was ordered no venous sinus thrombosis was seen.
The patient's exam has been improving slowly and as of [**2147-6-26**] in the afternoon she was following simple commands off of sedation.
CXR did not reveal significant consolidation.
LFTs showed mild elevation and trended down.
CT abdomen and RUQ ultrasound showed cholelithiasis but no biliary tract dilation.
Abdominal distension settled and feeds tolerated.
On [**7-11**]: swallow evaluation noted able to swallow with small residules.
She also had a video swallow on [**7-12**] they recommended a regular diet with crushed medicine and thickened fluids.
A repeat UA was negative for infection.
