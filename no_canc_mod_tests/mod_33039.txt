He was unable to have CTA at [**Hospital3 4107**] [**3-7**] difficulty placing appropriate bore IV.
Unable to have V/Q scan due to spatial constraints.
ABG with pH 7.21 CO2 92 O2 102 HCO3 39, he was intubated with post intubation ABG of 7.35 66 162 38.

[**8-20**] CXR: As compared to the previous examination, there is a minimal decrease of the signs indicative of overhydration.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall systolic function is good (LVEF >40%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
CTA [**8-11**]: 1.
ECG [**8-10**]: sinus tach at 110.
We also diuresed and afterload reduced as we believed diastolic dysfunction led to resp failure.
We kept him in unit for >24h s/p extubation and had ABG which was reassuring prior to transfer.
Floor course - pt being titrated down o2, assessing for OSA/OHA first with trial of CPAP, but since awaiting placement and relatively stable - monitoring o2 sat cont at night to document drop.
Pt will need sleep study as outpatient.
#2 Bilateral LE cellulitis - unclear if new cellulitis or just chronic stasis in setting of lymphedema.
Have your PCP arrange outpatient sleep study and consider possible pulmonary followup.
