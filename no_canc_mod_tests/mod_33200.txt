Surgery felt his exam was not consistent with necrotizing fasciitis.
LENIs were negative for DVT or any drainable collection.

He was also placed on droplet precautions, respiratory viral panel was ordered and Tamiflu was started empirically, however these were discontinued when his viral screens came back negative.
Urine legionella antigen was also negative x2.
His BP was actually borderline high on discharge, may consider increasing losartan dose as an outpatient.
