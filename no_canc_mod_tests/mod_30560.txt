Intubation was complicated, with oxygen saturation down to 65%, but never [**Doctor Last Name **]).
EKG was nonischemic.
Initial head CT was unremarkable.
Sedation was discontinued to obtain neurological exam and neurology consult was called.

He had a CT scan of chest which showed type a aortic disection.
An initial head CT was negative for significant intracranial pathology, but when the sedation was weaned to evaluate the patient's neurologic function he began to have seizure like activity.
The patient was evaluated by neurology, the CT scan was repeated without change and the decision was made to perform an EEG to evaluate the seizure activity.
We were notified by neurology that the patient's EEG trace showed "burst supression" and the on call neurologist explained to the family that meant that Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 99660**] had no chance of meaningful recovery.
