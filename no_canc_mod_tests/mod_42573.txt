On the morning of admission, the patient became confused, anxious, and dyspneic with a respiratory rate in the 40s, and oxygen saturation dropping to 70% on 2 liters; this improved to 95% on a 40% face mask.
The patient was taken to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 **], again, on [**9-10**], which is the date of admission, where his vital signs were stable; however, his mental status was still altered.
Electrocardiogram indicated atrial flutter at a rate of 110.
The patient also had lower extremity noninvasive Doppler studies which were negative.
Coronary artery disease, status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2116**]; catheterization in [**2124**] with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery; catheterization in [**2130**] with left main stenting, and multiple cardiac catheterizations in [**2131**] including a left anterior descending rotablation and stent.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.8.
He was afebrile with a heart rate of 72, respiratory rate of 24, blood pressure of 170/58, oxygen saturation 95% on 2.5 liters.
HEENT examination indicated zoster in a cranial nerve V division 1 distribution on the right.
Cardiovascular examination indicated a regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2.
The extremity examination indicated peripheral pulses that were 2+.
Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric.
LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial laboratory studies indicated a creatine kinase of 90, MB negative, troponin of 0.3.
Chem-7 with sodium of 140, potassium 5.3, chloride 110, bicarbonate 28, BUN 72, creatinine 2.1, glucose of 131.
White blood cell count 10.8, hematocrit 36.5, platelets 175.
PT 23.4, PTT 34.8, INR of 3.6.
An initial arterial blood gas indicated a pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 52, and PO2 of 77.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray indicated stable mediastinal widening and aortic root dilatation with a tracheal shift to the right which was old.
Lower extremity noninvasive Doppler studies were negative as was a urinalysis.
Electrocardiogram #1 indicated atrial flutter at a rate of 111 with 2:1 conduction, left axis deviation, left ventricular hypertrophy, Q waves in leads III and aVF, ST depressions in V4 through V6, and a T wave inversion in I and aVL.
Electrocardiogram #2 indicated a rate of 72, continued atrial flutter with persistent electrocardiogram changes.
An echocardiogram indicated mild left ventricular hypertrophy, moderately decreased left ventricular function, 2+ aortic regurgitation, and 1+ mitral regurgitation, 4+ tricuspid regurgitation, as well as severe cor pulmonale and severe pulmonary hypertension.
The patient's rate remained stable in the 70s to 80s, in atrial flutter throughout the remainder of his hospital stay until the last few hours prior to the patient's expiration.
Per Infectious Disease recommendations, the patient had a lumbar puncture which indicated 45 white blood cells in tube #1, 28 white blood cells in tube #4, and elevated protein at 67, normal opening pressure, and normal glucose.
A VVV PCR from the patient's cerebrospinal fluid was sent for analysis and was still pending at the time of the patient's demise; however, ultimately, the VVV PCR was read as negative.
An MRI of the head indicated moderate atrophy, small vessel disease.
Serial blood gases indicated PCO2 in the 70s to 80s; however, this did not always correlate with the patient's mental status.
steroids, as well as tried on an aminophyllin drip; however, neither seemed to effect the patient's pulmonary status.
The patient was also started on levofloxacin and Flagyl to treat possible aspiration pneumonia; although, a sputum culture ended up being negative, and the Infectious Disease consultation did not think the patient had a pneumonia, and these antibiotics were subsequently discontinued.
NEUROLOGY:  The patient had a head CT on the date of admission which was negative for mass lesion or bleed.
A metabolic workup was initiated which was negative with the exception of an elevated PCO2, which again did not seem to correlate with the patient's mental status.
On hospital day 16, the patient was noted to develop hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s as well as bradycardia.
