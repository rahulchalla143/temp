[**2115-1-7**] RUQ U/S: Evaluation is limited due to body habitus.
Echogenic liver may relate to fatty infiltration; other forms of more advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis/fibrosis not excluded on this study 2.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2115-1-8**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
[**2115-1-12**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
Non-urgent evaluation with contrast-enhanced MRI or multiphasic CT is recommended.
[**2115-1-16**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**1-10**], the hemodialysis catheter has been removed and replaced by a right subclavian PICC line that extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 yo male with hx of HTN, HL, obesity, and ETOH abuse who presented to OHS 4 days ago on [**1-3**] for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and was found to be have [**Last Name (un) **] with anuria, and severe c.diff colitis, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Stool studies were not sent during his GI bug.
His KUB showed dilated loops of bowel with air fluid levels, but no free air.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], his vancomycin PO was increased from 250mg to 500mg, IV flagyl was continued, and vancomycin enemas were started given concern for decreased gut motility.
His white count continued to trend up so flagyl was stopped and he was switched to tigecycline.
He had negative stool cultures here.
He had a repeat CT abd/pelvis that continued to show pancolitis with associated moderate intraabdominal and intrapelvic ascites.
His weight was 110.4kg on discharge with only trace lower extremity edema.
His weight prior to [**Known lastname **] was 104kg.
His LFTs have been trending down but still not WNL, and his synthetic function was also abnormal with elevated INR and low albumin.
Hepatitis serologies were negative.
#Hypoenhancing right hepatic lesion: Found on CT abd/pelvis which showed a hypoenhanncing hepatic lesion which may reflect focal hepatic steatosis, but a primary mass such as HCC cannot be excluded on this single-phase study.
Non-urgent evaluation with contrast-enhanced MRI or multiphasic CT is recommended, particularly in the setting of alcohol abuse and potential cirrhosis.
#Hypertension: Typically hypertensive, but was hypotensive during [**Month/Day/Year **] with improvement to systolic 110s while on lasix during last day of hospitalization.
#Transitional Issues: -Outpatient follow up with PCP [**Name10 (NameIs) **] biopsy to rule out cirrhosis -Contrast-enhanced MRI or multiphasic CT to rule out HCC -Florastor for any future course of abx -Code Status: Full Code (Confirmed) -Contact: Daughter, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **], is his health care proxy: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91841**]/cell: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91842**].
