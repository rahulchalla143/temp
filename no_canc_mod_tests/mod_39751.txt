PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On transfer the medicine floor the patient's temperature was 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 62, her blood pressure was 118/40, her respiratory rate was 17, and the patient's oxygen saturation was 100% on 40% face mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were unequal; left at 3 mm and right at 2 mm.

This was necessary as the hole around the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was quite large and had been draining large amounts of bile throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.
