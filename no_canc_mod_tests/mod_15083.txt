On [**2128-4-22**], an echocardiogram was done which revealed critical fibrocalcific aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 125 mmHg, a mean gradient of 74 mmHg, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.44, and 1+ aortic and mitral insufficiency.
The patient subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2128-4-27**], which demonstrated no hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease, but critical aortic stenosis consistent with his echocardiogram study results.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with a bypass time of 155 minutes and a crossclamp time of 130 minutes, and a rest time of 16 minutes.
The patient's pericardium was left open; lines placed included a right radial line and a right IJ line; both ventricular and atrial wires were placed; two mediastinal tubes were placed.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated, for further evaluation and management.
On transfer, the patient's mean arterial pressure was 76, CVP 12, PAD 17, and his [**Doctor First Name 1052**] was 25.
The patient was begun on anticoagulation therapy for a target INR of 2.5.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], for a target INR of 2.5.
