CXR shows moderate bilateral pleural effusions, which are likely due to pulmonary edema from renal failure.
# Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, B. cepacia pna: Followup of the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab sputum cultures showed Enterobacter, pseudomonas, and B. cepacia in cultures.
Her sputum culture here only shows 3+ GNR in the gram stain, and the culture is still pending.
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab physicians will need to follow up on blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures from [**Hospital1 18**], to make sure that the patient's cefepime 14 day course is sufficient, and to make sure that no new antibiotics need to be started.
CK was 31 (to assess for rhabdomyolysis).
During admission, it was difficult to assess how different her MS is from her baseline aphasia and dementia.
# UTI: Urine culture shows 1+ gram positive bacteria, likely alpha-streptococcus or lactobacillus.
The pt has a history of VRE UTIs, so this urine culture will need to be followed up for characterization and sensitivities, and to make sure that no further organisms appear in the culture.
On [**4-19**], the patient's INR was 1.6.
Patient's INR goal is 2.5-3.5, since she has a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical [**Male First Name (un) 1291**] and AFIB.
