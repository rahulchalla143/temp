She has lost approximately 20% of her weight since then.

PERTINENT IMAGING STUDIES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:  Please see hospital course below.
However, due to her unusual anatomy with status post esophagectomy, her stomach was above the costochondral margin and was unable to be insufflated with either NG tube or Dobbhoff feeding tube.
General Surgery was then contact[**Name (NI) **] for evaluation of placement of jejunostomy in the OR.
A CT of the abdomen was performed on postoperative day number three which showed dilated small bowel with pneumatosis raising the question of obstruction versus ischemia.
A lactate level was sent at that time and was found to be mildly elevated at 3.6.
However, clinically, the patient did not have signs of acute ischemia and, therefore, it was felt necessary to repeat the CT scan with oral contrast for better evaluation.
An NG tube was again placed under fluoroscopy the evening of [**2162-3-1**] and a repeat CT of the abdomen with contrast through the NG tube was performed the following morning.
A repeat CT scan showed delayed contrast passage but filling past the transition point (at the J tube insertion site) between dilated and collapsed bowel loops.
An upper GI series was performed on postoperative day number nine and showed passage of barium with distended small bowel loops at the J tube transition site which was worrisome for mechanical obstruction.
A repeat upper GI series will be performed on [**2162-3-12**] to reassess for mechanical obstruction now that the smaller feeding tube is in place.
Venous access was a major issue during this and previous hospitalizations and, therefore, a midline was placed on [**2162-2-26**] to expedite blood draws and maintain suitable intravenous access.
The procedure showed occlusion of the mid to distal SVC with multiple collaterals noted.
IV heparin was not able to be used due to inability to monitor PTT as peripheral blood could not be drawn.
However, on postoperative day number 15, she had an elevation of her white blood cell count up to 21.
She was re-cultured at this time and again culture data and chest x-ray showed no signs of infection.
