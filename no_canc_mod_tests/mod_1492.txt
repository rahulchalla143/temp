She was found to have positive blood cultures, ([**1-15**]) for pseudomonas.
Today, patient was found hypotensive and bradycardic at her nursing home, with SBP in 80's and HR in the 50's.
She was brought to the ED, where her vitals were T 100/9, HR 68, BP 130/40, RR 18, O2 sat 99% 6L NC.
Shortly thereafter, patient became bradycardic with HR to 30's and BP to 80's.
ECG obtained revealed complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm.
CT Torso was obtained, which was only remarkable for a small left pleural effusion and bilateral shoulder effusions.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 8 cm.

CTA Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2121-10-22**]: 1.
Fluid collections around both shoulders of unknown etiology.
ECHO [**2121-10-23**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-10-15**], the findings are similar with less tricuspid regurgitation and lower estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
LENI [**2121-10-24**]: 1.
CTA Head/Neck [**2121-10-24**]: 1.
CT perfusion demonstrates delayed transit time, reduced blood flow and reduced blood volume in this region.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2121-10-25**]: Edema of the right hemisphere with mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle and 4 mm leftward shift of midline structures.
CT of head was obtained urgently showing R ACA/MCA infarct with dense R MCA most likely cardioembolic secondary to Afib.
Given the extensive infarct with evidence of completion plus the fact that she was already anticoagulated with INR 2.0 she was not given lytics (IA tPA) due to high likelihood of hemorrhagic transformation with such intervention.
CT head [**2121-10-25**] demonstrated mid-line shift.
