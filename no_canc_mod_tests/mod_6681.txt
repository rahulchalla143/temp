Patient exam prior TPA is significant for left eye gaze deviation, right hemianopsia, severe dysarthia, not following commands and left arm/face > leg motor weakness.
Neuro:  There was minimal improvement in exam the morning following TPA administration (L gaze deviation, weak withdrawal R arm, no speech, does not follow any commands), repeat Head CT at 24 hours showed some R cerebellar hemorrhage and hemorrhage into infarct.
NSTEMI with elevated troponin to >5, CK peak at 468 continuing to trend down.
Continued ASA, plavix, BB (target HR 60-70, sbp <130) heparin gtt.
Renal ultrasound showed patent right artery; left kidney old and small in size.
AAA with intramural thrombus - stable per vascular surgery.
