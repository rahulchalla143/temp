Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy [**2186-10-25**] (bedside) Bronchoscopy [**2186-10-25**] (operating room) Intubation [**2186-10-24**] - [**2186-10-27**]   History of Present Illness: 42-year-old man with asthma transferred from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital for further management of respiratory failure.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, CXR showed mild prominence of the central vasculature which may suggest fluid overload but no pulmonary edema, infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax.
ABDOMEN: soft, non-tender, normal bowel sounds EXT: warm and well-perfused, non-edematous NEURO: AAOx3, moving all extremities  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: [**2186-10-24**] 01:30AM   WBC-16.2* RBC-4.95 HGB-13.6* HCT-40.0 MCV-81* MCH-27.5 MCHC-34.1 RDW-13.9 [**2186-10-24**] 01:30AM   NEUTS-91* BANDS-4 LYMPHS-3* MONOS-2 EOS-0 BASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0 [**2186-10-24**] 01:30AM   HYPOCHROM-NORMAL ANISOCYT-OCCASIONAL POIKILOCY-NORMAL MACROCYT-NORMAL MICROCYT-1+ POLYCHROM-NORMAL OVALOCYT-OCCASIONAL [**2186-10-24**] 01:30AM   PLT COUNT-196 [**2186-10-24**] 01:30AM   GLUCOSE-162* UREA N-20 CREAT-1.1 SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-4.4 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-16 [**2186-10-24**] 01:16PM   ANCA-NEGATIVE B [**2186-10-24**] 01:16PM   [**Doctor First Name **]-NEGATIVE  CT Chest [**2186-10-24**] - 1)Diffuse tracheobronchial wall thickening with calcification causing narrowing of the entire tracheobronchial tree with mucous plugging in the lower lobes bilaterally.
ECHO [**2186-10-25**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Trachea Pathology [**10-25**] - Respiratory mucosa with focal squamous metaplasia and marked mixed inflammation with fibrino-inflammatory exudates.
He underwent influenza DFA testing that returned negative; urine legionella was also negative.
Lactate trended down from 5 to 2.3.
He underwent CTA that did not show PE although the CTA findings were highly suggestive of relapsing polychondritis.
He underwent bronchoscopy x2 that showed diffuse airway inflammation; endobronchial biopsies showed focal squamous metaplasia and marked mixed inflammation with fibrino-inflammatory exudates, although no calcification (as one would expect in relapsing polychondritis).
On [**10-25**], he underwent echocardiogram that showed normal left ventricular systolic function with no valvular disease.
Exam was notable for persistent diffuse coarse breath sounds with faint expiratory wheezes, although there was no tachypnea, accessory muscle use, or respiratory distress.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
A CTA scan of your chest and the appearance of your bronchial tree on bronchoscopy were highly suggestive of a diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis.
