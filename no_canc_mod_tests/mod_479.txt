Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated left and right sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 26mmHg and RVEDP of 12mmHg.
There was moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures with a PASP of 60mmHg.
- CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2180-5-25**] 1:58 PM FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-erect position.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 64 yo male PMHx significant for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, s/p ICD placement [**2175**] (v paced), mild-mod MR/TR, DM, ICD, Afib on coumadin, gout, hypothyroidism, CKD p/w vtach and ICD firing, recently admitted for ICD firing, CHF w/ EF 20-25%% who presents from heart failure clinic w/hypotension.
# Goals of care: Upon admission to the ICU, the patient was started on a milrinone gtt, with some improvement in fluid balance and blood pressures.
A discussion was held with both the wife and the patient spelling out the patient's very poor prognosis; cardiac transplant was off the table secondary both to the patient's wishes in addition to his poor compliance in the past.
Pt presented to Heart Failure clinic and found to be very hypotensive (60/40; wife reported SBP in 70s) and was sent to ED.
Cr was elevated to 3.6 and pt appeared very dehydrated on exam.
There he had a lactate of 2.5.
CXR showed significant pulmonary edema but atypical PNA could not be ruled out.
A Swan-Ganz was floated, which showed moderately elevated left and right sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 26mmHg and RVEDP of 12mmHg.
There was moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures with a PASP of 60mmHg.
Repeat lipase trending down (277-->184), making pancreatitis less likely.
# CHF:  Pt has hx of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, s/p ICD placement [**2175**] (v paced), mild-mod MR/TR.
In ED, CXR now showed ?pulm edema vs atypical PNA (started on vanco, flagyl and cefipime on day of admission [**2180-5-23**]).
Chest xray was significant for cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema vs ?atypical PNA or both.
