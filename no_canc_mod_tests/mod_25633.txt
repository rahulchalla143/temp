Her NIHSS was 23 and a CT head was reported to be unrevealing.
Labs notable for INR 0.99 and Cr 1.8.
She was intubated for airway protection, started on propofol, and transferred here for further evaluation and management.
Per daughter, she had stopped her antihypertensives for the past 2-3 weeks after a dental procedure when she was told her blood pressure was running low (and was recommended to stop one [**Doctor Last Name 360**]).

ECHO Conclusions: The left atrium is dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast (single injection).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Her neurological exam failed to show much improvement off of the sedation.
