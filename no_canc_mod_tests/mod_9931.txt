Emergency Medical Service was called, and the patient was found to have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Scale of 3.
Her fingerstick was 119.
She was sent to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department where she was breathing shallowly with a temperature of 95.6.
Initially screening laboratories revealed an alcohol level of 200, and osmolar gap of 43, and an anion gap of 17.
The urine toxicology and serum toxicology screens were otherwise negative.
An electrocardiogram was done without significant abnormalities noted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Initially, the patient had a temperature of 93 which improved to 97.8 in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's heart rate was in the 90s to 100s.
The patient's blood pressure was 95 to 100/50s.
Fingerstick was 111.
The patient arrived on intermittent mandatory ventilation 600 X 10, 40% FIO2, breathing 13 to 14, with an arterial blood gas of 7.44/35/556.
Skin examination revealed warm and dry extremities and anicteric skin.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils that were 2 mm bilaterally symmetric and reactive.
Neck examination was supple with no lymphadenopathy, and the trachea was midline.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal examination revealed the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent laboratory data revealed the patient had a white blood cell count of 16.5, hematocrit was 43.2, and platelets were 324.
INR was 1.1.
Fibrinogen was 309.
Sodium was 144, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 11, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was 122.
Amylase was 58.
Calcium was 9.5, phosphate was 5.5, and magnesium was 2.2.
Serum osmolarity was 342 with an osmolar gap of 43; and when this was corrected for alcohol the osmolar gap was completely attributable to alcohol consumption.
Serum toxicology screen showed an alcohol of 200, and other toxins were negative.
Urine toxicology screen was negative.
Urinalysis was negative.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus with a question of left atrial abnormality, normal intervals, QTc of 400, early repolarization V2 through V3, and P-R depression of 1 mm inferiorly.
A chest x-ray revealed endotracheal tube was in the correct position.
A depression screen revealed that she had occasionally felt sad with regard to losing her father several years prior and has had difficulty sleeping, feelings of guilt at work, and irritability, trouble concentration, and some psychomotor slowing.
On further probing, the social worker for the Intensive Care Unit as well as the Safe Transition social worker were able to develop a confidence with the patient in which she admitted that she actually was given fruit juice mixed with Bicardi rum and that both she and her co-worker were consuming this while at work.
They did not feel that there was any need for a further psychiatric evaluation, and she was felt to be safe and did not require a one-to-one sitter.
A neurological examination was performed which, in conjunction with the psychiatric examination, did not show any focal abnormalities.
Cranial nerve V, root 1 to 3, were intact to light touch; and the motor division was intact to resistance.
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the patellar and Achilles and downgoing at the plantar reflexes.
Light touch was intact in all four extremities and trunk.
A cholesterol panel was checked and was within normal limits.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction, and serial electrocardiogram showed no evolution of electrocardiogram changes.
Given the atypical nature of her symptoms and circumstances of her presentation, it would be reasonable for the patient to have an outpatient stress test with imaging to remove ischemic heart disease as a potential etiology for her discomfort.
