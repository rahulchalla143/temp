ECG [**2143-1-7**]: Sinus tachycardia.
Since the previous tracing of [**2142-10-5**] sinus tachycardia rate is faster and modest ST-T wave changes are present.
Chest Xray [**2143-1-9**]: Single AP portable view of the chest is obtained.
Heart size cannot be assessed.
CT chest: 1.
Overall the findings have progressed since the prior study obtained in [**2141-8-25**].
She was sent from [**Hospital1 **] for ED evaluation of pneumonia after her oxygen saturation was noted to be low.
Blood cultures were sent and are pending.
Sputum culture was negative.
She had a CT chest which showed ground glass opacities bilaterally possibly reflecting infection vs drug-induced lung injury.
Serum and urine tox screen were unrevealing, and she had no further episodes.
Gram stain had no PMS and no organisms.
However, in the setting of joint prosthesis, she will need cautious monitoring off of antibiotic therapy.
