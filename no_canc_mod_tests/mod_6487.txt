Admission Date:  [**2183-1-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-1-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 83 yo male with history of CAD, DM with significant neuropathy, HTN, CHF with EF 40-45% in [**2176**] presenting with acute dyspnea.
His saturations improved to 100% and he became more comfortable and less tachypneic.
His saturations and tachypnea improved however but he still remained on 4LNC as he was found to be 89% on RA.
His last set of vitals were 97.4 102 137/88 18 94%4LNC.
He was incidentally noted to have left 5th and 6th rib fractures on CXR secondary to recent fall.
He was given labetolol for RVR rate control but became hypotensive and given dopamine.
His RVR worsened and was switched to neosynephrine.
His troponins peaked to 1.97 but were thought to be [**1-15**] demand.
DM type 2, complicated by peripheral neuropathy 3.
CHF: echo [**2-15**] with trivial MR, LVEF 40-45%, apical/ant/inf hypokinesis 5. h/o basal cell CA 6. h/o squamous cell CA of skin 7.
Left arm tricep weakness (states this is old), [**3-18**] bilateral hip and gastroc flex/ext, 1+ patellars, downgoing toes  Pertinent Results: [**2183-1-23**] 07:34AM WBC-6.7 RBC-4.70 HGB-14.9 HCT-43.8 MCV-93 MCH-31.8 MCHC-34.1 RDW-14.3 NEUTS-84.9* LYMPHS-10.6* MONOS-2.3 EOS-1.7 BASOS-0.5 PLT COUNT-172  GLUCOSE-101* UREA N-25* CREAT-1.4* SODIUM-144 POTASSIUM-4.9 CHLORIDE-112* TOTAL CO2-17* ANION GAP-20 CALCIUM-8.5 PHOSPHATE-4.1 MAGNESIUM-2.3  PT-12.1 PTT-21.7* INR(PT)-1.0  cTropnT-0.01 proBNP-3067*  LACTATE-2.8*  TYPE-ART PO2-112* PCO2-35 PH-7.42 TOTAL CO2-23 BASE XS-0  TSH-0.88  [**2183-1-23**] 11:59AM LACTATE-1.6  CXR [**1-24**] FINDINGS: Compared to the film from earlier the same day, there continues to be moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular redistribution and hazy alveolar infiltrate.
EKG [**1-24**] Narrow complex regular supraventricular tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2183-1-23**] irregular supraventricular tachycardia is present.
TTE [**1-23**] The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 30-45 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2177-2-17**], mild to moderate aortic stenosis is new.
His SVT was likely related to missing several doses of metoprolol as well as volume shifts with diuresis in the setting of an abnormal LA.
#) The patient's home DM regimen should be restarted upon return home and his blood sugars were well controlled while in the hospital.
