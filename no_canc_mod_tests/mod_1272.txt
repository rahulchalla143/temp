Imaging CXR [**2144-8-22**]:  Impression: The current study demonstrates biventricular pacing devices with the leads most likely located in the right atrium, right ventricle and the left epicardial vein in expected location.
ECG [**8-11**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Chest X-ray [**8-11**]: FINDINGS: The heart size is enlarged, apparently slightly increased from prior study, this maybe the magnifying effect of AP projection.

# Cardiac arrest: on [**8-18**], patient was successfully cardioverted to normal sinus rhythem.
She was briefly transferred to the CCU, where her magnesium and potassium were repleted and serial EKGs showed decreasing QTc interval.
Has known history of CHF with EF 25% in 4/[**2143**].
Initial history and exam consistent with a CHF exacerbation.
Therefore, her rate was not well controlled which is likely stressing the heart by decreasing adequate forward flow.
Warfarin dose decreased from 6 to 5 prior to discharge due to supratherapuetic INR 3.1.
She is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within the next 2 weeks, and device clinic on [**8-27**] for evaluation of pacemaker.
LDL was 147 in 3/[**2143**].
After examination rash appeared to be fungal in etiology, most c/w with intertrigo.
