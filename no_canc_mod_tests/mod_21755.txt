An accompanying friend provided sublingual nitroglycerin with resolution of the pain.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8, blood pressure 140/80, pulse of 75, breathing 18, 97 percent on 2 liters.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally; notable for distant breath sounds.
Extremities:  No edema, no clubbing, no cyanosis appreciated; pulses 1 plus femorals bilaterally, dorsalis pedis not palpable on either side but Dopplerable.
PERTINENT DIAGNOSTICS:  EKG:  Sinus tachycardia, 100, downsloping ST segment in 1 and aVL, 1 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depression in V3 through V6, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V1.
INITIAL LABORATORY DATA FROM THE OUTSIDE FACILITY:  CBC: White count 5.8, hematocrit 37, platelets 143.
Chemistries: Sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 101, bicarbonate 32, BUN 27, creatinine 1.9 (unknown baseline), glucose 86, PT and PTT 10.6 and 23.5, respectively.
Digoxin level 0.61, troponin I 0.1.
The patient was placed on aspirin, beta blocker, and statin and was planned to go to cardiac catheterization the morning following admission.
Repeat EKG at this time revealed no other changes.
A chest x-ray at the time revealed findings consistent with mild failure and an ABG indicated hypercarbic respiratory failure.
A head CT was performed which showed no evidence of acute hemorrhage, however revealed chronic white matter infarctions.
An echocardiogram was then performed which revealed a preserved ejection fraction of greater than 55 percent.
His creatinine reached a peak of 2.2 and was resolving at the time of discharge.
The patient was unable to tolerate an ACE inhibitor due to this rise in his serum creatinine.
The patient was noted to have a hematocrit drop to 25 during his CCU stay, at which time a CT scan of the abdomen was obtained to ensure that there was no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or hemorrhage as a potential complication of his cardiac catheterization.
The patient received two units of blood with appropriate increase in his hematocrit, which remained stable throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
The patient received blood cultures during his CCU course that revealed one out of four bottles positive for gram positive cocci subsequently identified as coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
However, upon further identification and failure of the other cultures and subsequent surveillance cultures to grow out, the vancomycin was held.
On transfer to the Telemetry floor the patient was evaluated by the Speech and Swallow team and a formal video swallow with barium was performed.
Repeat video swallow evaluation  was requested within one to two weeks following further rehabilitation.
Repeat video swallow study in one to two weeks to evaluate    ongoing risk of aspiration.
