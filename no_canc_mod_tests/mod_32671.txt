She was hemodynamically stable with sats 100% on NRB.
Non-contrast head CT showed diffuse hypodensity in the left frontal, parietal and temporal regions, likely from prior CVA's.
A UA showed a possible UTI and the pt received 500 mg IV levaquin.
CTA of the brain/neck showed subacute infarct in the inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery, carotid arteries were patent.
EEG showed a slow background which may be seen in a mild encephalopathy, or in the setting of extensive, bilateral or deeper midline subcortical lesions.

[**2160-1-6**] CTA Head & Neck: HEAD CT:  Hypodensity in the distribution of the left inferior middle cerebral artery likely represents a subacute ischemic event.
HEAD AND NECK CTA:  The extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent without evidence of stenosis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Neurology consult was called for evaluation of unresponsiveness.
Initially there was a concern for acute stroke, but head CT and head CTA were negative.
Her oxygen saturation was titrated to 90-94%.
She should get a sleep study as an outpatient and arrange for CPAP accordingly.
Her heart rate is V-paced at 70.
At rehab, her sugars should be closely monitored and insulin titrated accordingly.
