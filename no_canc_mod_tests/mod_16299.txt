The patient reports loosing weight since discharge from hospitalization on [**5-5**].
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] and underwent cardiac catheterization.
The cardiac catheterization demonstrated a patent left anterior descending stent, serial 40% lesions in obtuse marginal 2, 80% right coronary artery lesion with left to right collaterals from the left anterior descending, PAP pressures 43/20.
The patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit for concerns of elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressures post procedure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Blood pressure 121/66; pulse 56; respirations 15, O2 saturation 98%.
Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Two plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 10.8, normal differential.
Hematocrit 40.8, platelets 372.
Sodium 137, potassium hemolyzed, chloride 100, bicarbonate 25, BUN 21, creatinine 0.6, glucose 88.
CK 159, troponin less than 0.3, MB 2.0.
Coagulation studies were INR 2.1.
EKG normal sinus rhythm at 70, normal axis and intervals.
He was negative approximately two liters post cardiac catheterization and his wedge pressure returned to [**Location 213**].
The patient underwent echocardiogram which demonstrated no pericardial effusion.
Ejection fraction 30 to 35% on early depressed overall left ventricular systolic function.
The patient's Telemetry monitoring demonstrated no arrhythmia and the patient will continue to follow-up for further electrophysiology studies as planned through [**Hospital6 **].
; INR measured at 2.6 on [**2177-5-16**].
PLEASE SEND CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION REPORT AND ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT WITH CARBON COPIES.
