CXR [**2130-8-20**]: The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.
TTE [**2130-8-21**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
LOWER EXTREMITY U/S [**2130-8-21**]: 1.
CT CHEST [**2130-8-22**]: Marked pulmonary parenchymal damage with multifocal cavitary consolidations, ground-glass opacity and nodular opacities, all compatible with advanced infectious process.
CT TORSO [**2130-8-27**]: 1.
CT HEAD [**2130-8-27**]: Extremely limited study.
If this is a clinical concern, then a repeat head CT may be helpful.
CT LOWER EXTREMITY [**2130-8-27**]: 1.
TTE [**2130-8-31**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
CT Chest [**9-4**] 1.
Within the limitations of the CT technique, the pulmonary emboli in the left interlobar branches appear unchanged whereas the bilateral lower lobe segmental artery emboli have minimally resolved.
Minimal decrease in the size of mediastinal lymphadenopathy  CXR [**2130-9-11**]  In comparison with the study of [**9-9**], there are slightly lower lung volumes but little overall change in the bilateral lung abscesses.
Air-fluid level is suggested in the left upper zone.
EGD [**2130-9-19**] Esophagus: Mucosa: Grade [**1-5**] esophagitis was seen in the distal esophagus, compatible with esophagitis.
Greater than 6 cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the end and base of stomach antrum ulcer.

She was placed on a single ventilator within two days, and then underwent bronchoscopy on [**8-24**] by IP, revealing air leakage of most major segmental bronchi which essentially precluded an endoscopic plugging of the BPF.
She will need re-evaluation with CT and follow up appointment with IP to discuss long-term management of the bronchopleural fistula 2 weeks after discharge.
RIGHT PULMONARY ABSCESS/LEFT PNEUMONIA:  She received vanco/zosyn at the OSH, and continued to receive vanco/zosyn/tobramycin for enhanced gram negative coverage.
Sputum culture from [**8-22**] showed pan sensitive MSSA and sparse GNR.
Bronchoalveolar lavage on [**8-24**] showed no organisms, including PCP/acid fast/fungi.
Sputum culture from [**8-25**] showed a pair of non-fermenting GNR sensitive to zosyn/tobra.
CT scan of chest on [**8-22**] showed marked pulmonary parenchymal damage with multifocal cavitary consolidations, ground-glass opacity and nodular opacities, all compatible with advanced infectious process.
CT torso on [**2130-8-27**] revealed improvment of his RML/RUL cavitating lesion with a new fluid level within the cavity and a more dense consolidation RLL.
Antibiotics were later changed to linezolid/zosyn/ tobramycin on [**8-29**] when blood cultures grew VRE from a suspected infected femoral CVL, subsequently, zosyn/tobramycin was discontinued per ID recs and meropenem was started.
Her sputum culture from [**8-27**] revealed ALCALIGENES FAECALIS, which was treated with meropenem from [**Date range (1) 91431**].
PULMONARY EMBOLUS, BILATERAL:  She underwent CTA prior to transfer that demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli.
SEPTIC SHOCK:  She initially presented hypotensive with systolic BP in the 80s around the time of her intubation.
With leukocytosis to 23 with heavy bandemia, fevers, and multifocal pneumonia, a septic source was likely.
TTE failed to reveal evidence of cardiogenic shock.
VRE BACTEREMIA:  Blood culture from [**2130-8-26**] grew out vancomycin resistant enterococcus, likely from a femoral line that subsequently became contaminated.
A low retic count of 1 likely reflected a sluggish marrow in the context of systemic illness.
She did not require further transfusions after she was discharged from the MICU and maintained a hematocrit of 22-24.
She did experience some diarrhea, which may have been withdrawal (c.diff x3 and stool cultures were negative), and the diarrhea resolved prior to discharge.
