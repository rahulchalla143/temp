His hematocrit was at 35, and he was denying chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, melena, bright red blood per rectum.

LABORATORY STUDIES UPON TRANSFER:  Complete blood count: white blood cell count 6.9, hematocrit 35.6, MCV 88, platelets 64.
PT 15.5, PTT 38.6 INR 1.6.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, BUN 5, creatinine 0.6, glucose 113, calcium 7.3, magnesium 1.3, phosphorus 4.1.
ALT 98, AST 133, LDH 221.
Alkaline phosphatase 124.
Total bilirubin 2.5.
Upper GI bleed/status post TIPS:  The patient was transferred to the general floor after having a TIPS procedure on the 5th.
His hematocrit was stable at 35.
An ultrasound was performed on the [**8-3**], and was read as having a patent TIPS with no ascites.
The patient began to spike temperatures on the [**8-4**], temperature max 103.3, during which the patient has been treated for SBP prophylaxis with Levaquin 500 mg po q day.
A CT scan of the abdomen was performed at that time to assess for any fluid collection near the site of the TIPS, perhaps an abscess, or a hematoma.
The CT scan impression read no abscess, small amount of ascites with pericholecystic fluid.
The patient continued to spike temperatures throughout the remainder of his hospital course receiving Tylenol prn and blood and urine cultures were sent with each spiking temperature with no growth to date upon discharge.
Interventional Radiology consulted us on this decision, and we were advised to follow the liver function tests including total bilirubin and INR as indicated for worsening liver function, which would warrant a TIPS revision.
His bilirubin was as high as 5.3 on the [**8-4**].
By day of discharge, his bilirubin had come down to 2.6.
Alkaline phosphatase was as high as 219 on the [**8-4**], and had trended down to 190 upon discharge.
The patient remained febrile throughout the remainder of his hospital course, however, there was no obvious source of infection based on CT scan of the abdomen, ultrasound, and chest x-ray performed on the [**8-3**].
History of lower gastrointestinal bleed:  Patient's hematocrit was stable status post TIPS ranging from 32 to 33 throughout much of his hospital course.
However, on the day of discharge, [**2166-6-6**], his hematocrit had dropped from 33 to 28.6.
A repeat hematocrit was drawn later on that morning and was 30.3.
Diabetes mellitus type 2:  Patient's blood sugars varied from 150 to 250 throughout most of his hospital course.
After his hematocrit had gone up from 28 to 30, we decided that the patient was stable for discharge.
