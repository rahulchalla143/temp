When she was found she had a forced Right gaze and was not moving her left side.
She had a CT of the brain at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] which showed a right sided brain lesion.

A followup MRI following resolution of the hemorrhage is necessary to further characterize the underlying lesion.
CT Torso [**2104-6-28**]: 1.
A 7.1-cm lesion in the superior portion of the uterus may correspond to the fibroid but further evaluation is recommended by pelvic ultrasound.
Further evaluation is recommended by thyroid ultrasound.
Pap smear [**2104-6-30**]: AT LEAST HIGH GRADE SQUAMOUS INTRAEPITHELIAL LESION  Thyroid U/S [**2104-6-30**]:  Spongy nodule seen in the left lobe of the thyroid.
Based on ultrasound criteria, this nodule does not demonstrate any worrisome features and a routine followup ultrasound could be performed in one year.
Abdominal U/S [**2104-6-30**]: 1.
Pelvic U/S [**2104-6-30**]: 1.
A GYN consult is suggested and this mass could be further assessed with pelvic MRI in conjunction with pap smear / biopsy.
MRI pelvis [**2104-7-3**]: 1.
MRI stage 1B1.
She underwent MRI of the brain and was then able to tolerate extubation.
Brain MRI demonstrated an enhancing R parietal lesion.
On [**6-30**] an a/p and thyroid ultrasound demonstrated a large cervical mass and benign liver/thiroid and cholelithiasis.
On [**7-1**] They recommended an MRI pelvis which was ordered.
It responded to ativan and a Head CT was stable.
On [**7-3**] an MRI fo the pelvis was performed and GYN recommended biopsy due to the pap smear result of high grade dysplasia.
