CT ABD ([**2168-10-30**]): 1.
CXR ([**2168-11-5**]): The lung volumes are relatively low, likely accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures.
CT ABD ([**2168-11-7**]): 1.
Limited study secondary to beam hardening artifact.
Fluid, fluid levels seen with within this large hematoma.

Upper Ext US ([**2168-11-17**]): FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, basilic, and cephalic veins were performed.
CT showed collection in subcutaneous tissue with increased stranding posteriorly (?
She was found to be guaiac negative but abdominal CT showed a new, large rectus sheath hematoma.
Hct improved to 28.7 by [**11-10**].
Pt was transferred out of MICU on [**2168-11-13**] once her HCT had stabilized.
On [**11-14**] pt seemed to have acutely worse pain and an abd CT was obtained which showed no change in the hematoma even though the HCT went from 32.3 to 28.8 but returned to baseline the next morning to 30.8.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] had suggested restarting coumadin without a heparin bridge and starting and adjusting the dose very gingerly with tight INR monitoring and control as they did not think she had a bleed while on coumadin.
However, per patient, past spirometry studies showed only restrictive disease secondary to obesity and now obstructive or reversible process.
Her oxygen saturations remained stable during the hospitalization and her chest x-ray was unremarkable for infiltrative process.
Chest x-rays showed no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
(Monvi [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103922**])  Since she was diagnosed as legally blind she spoke with SW in regards to finding appropriate housing and services after she is done with rehab.
Following volume repletion, Cr returned back to baseline.
5) Complicated urinary tract infection, with urine culture that initially grew Klebsiella, pan-sensitive.
Culture [**11-9**] later grew cipro-resistant but TMP/SMX-sensitive E. coli.
New UA and culture show E. coli UTI, resistant to bactrim and foley was removed and pt was started on ceftriaxone for 10 days and follow up UA was negative for UTI and the culture is pending.
Prior to ICU admission, patient was maintained on an IV heparin drip with a plan to start coumadin when PTT reached 60-80.
Hct was noted to be as low as 27, and blood transfusions were given PRN.
