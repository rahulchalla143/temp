His lethargy increased and a lumbar puncture was pursued.
A septic meningitis was discovered, but the etiology was not discovered (a broad diagnosis for this was considered, including vasculitis, Sarcoidosis, metastatic cancer and various infectious etiologies; CSF for various infections along with cytologies were lost in transit to lab - however, stroke was thought to better explain his symptom complex per Neurology and thus a repeat lumbar puncture was not pursued).
A CT and MRI of the head and brain were unrevealing for CNS pathology.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] was considered (but his respiratory tracings were not consistent with this) as well as more ominous pattern of brainstem dysfunctioning.
An ECG did not show a prolonged QT interval.
His temperature on the day of discharge was 96.8.
Anemia: His HCT remained stable in the low 30's.
He required one unit of PRBC for a HCT of 27 on admission, but his HCT remained stable in the low 30's thereafter.
H/O RIJ Clot/DVT/PE: Once his HCT stablized, he was transitioned from heparin to Coumadin for an INR goal of [**1-26**].
He needs his INR checked daily and his coumadin titrated to maintain INR between 2 and 3.
Can give D50 or oral glucose if blood sugar is low.
His coumadin should be held tonight, and INR should be checked daily (goal [**1-26**]).
His blood sugar should be checked QID.
