Culture screened for Adenovirus, Influenza A & B, Parainfluenza type       1,2 & 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus.
ABG was 7.46/33/72.
In the MICU, it was felt that the patient's CXR was consistent with ARDs or volume overload.
HIV testing was done and was negative.
Prior to the patient's discharge from the MICU, a rapid respiratory viral screen/culture was sent- negative for Adenovirus, Influenza A & B, Parainfluenza type 1,2 & 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus.
Hyponatremia - It was felt that this was likely hypovolemic hyponatremia from dehydration, as his urine Na was <10 and he was hypovolemic on exam.
His hyponatremia resolved after he was given fluids.
Hyponatremia was not an issue upon discharge from the medicine floor.
Additionally, his EKG was consistent with RVH.
An echo was ordered and was within normal limits.
While here you required oxygen therapy to keep your levels high.
