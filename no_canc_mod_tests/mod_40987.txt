CT showed left intraventricular hemorrhage.
He was transferred to the ICU intubated on pressure support with levophed for a MAP >60.
He had an echocardiogram which showed an "ejection fraction of 25%, mildly dilated LA, mild symmetric LVH, mid-distal anteroseptal and apical akinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere, RV cavity dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis, mild AR, mild MR, no pericardial effusion."
Cardiac enzymes did not suggest massive new MI.
Bilateral LENIs did not show any DVTs.
# Hypotension: Unclear etiology of hypotension; echo showed depressed ejection fraction so maybe cardiogenic in origin.
Attempts were made to place radial and femoral a-lines but were unsuccessful due to peripheral arterial disease.
IVF and levophed were used to keep urine output >30cc/hr and a MAP >60.
His supratherapeutic INR was reversed in the setting of IVH and his anti-coagulation was held.
A CT head showed no interval change in intraventricular hemorrhage in the temporal and occipital horns of the left lateral ventricle.
He was given aggressive fluid resuscitation and his lactate trended down throughout his MICU stay.
On [**9-7**] he had a potassium of 5.7.
An EKG did not demonstrate peaked T-waves.
# Lung nodules - a CT demonstrate ground glass opacities and a nodules that should be followed up in [**2-1**] months.
