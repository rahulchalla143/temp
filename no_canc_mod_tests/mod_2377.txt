However, his pressures soon dropped again into the 70s and a R IJ was placed and the patient was started on Levophed.
The patient was also initially 86% on RA, and maintained his sats on face mask.
The patient also had multiple imaging studies done, with no e/o acute source of infection, or any acute intracranial pathology.
Labs notable for white count of 14, lactate of 5.8.
EKG with e/o LBBB c/w priors, Scarbossa criteria negative.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 94.5 124/59 62 24 100% on 50% high flow mask.
