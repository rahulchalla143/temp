Admission Date:  [**2201-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2201-2-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2137-4-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ketorolac / Nalbuphine / Simvastatin / Atorvastatin / Crestor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Persistent RLL obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubatation Arterial Line placed IJ line placed at OSH removed PICC line placed Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 15036**] is a 63 year-old woman with a history of sarcoidosis who presents on transfer for evaluation of persistent cough/fever and RLL obstruction.
PFTs showed FVC 66%, FEV1 60%, FEV/FVC 76% predicted with no change with bronchodilators.
TLC was 98% predicted though DLCO was 52% predicted.
Bronchoscopy was done on [**2200-12-26**] and showed segmental material partially obstructing the posterior segment of the RLL with marked friability and edema.
Biopsy showed chronic inflammation with focal acute inflammation superimposed.
CT showed RLL consolidation with stenotic areas.
Seen in pulm follow-up and underwent rigid bronchoscopy ([**2201-1-27**]) with removal of foreign body/vegetable material along opening of stenotic bronchis of RLL.
A repeat CT showed RLL infiltrate/atelectasis.
Also complicated by troponin of 2.69 for which cardiology was consulted; they recommended beta-blocker, aspirin and heparin gtt.
Subsequent echo showed EF of 30% and anterior spetal wall motion abnormality.
Sarcoidosis 2.
Pancreatic disease - s/p cholecystectomy, [**2177**] - s/p sphincterotomy, [**2177**] - numerous ERCP 6.
Osteoarthritis 8.
Total abdominal hysterectomy, [**2181**] 4.
Kyphoplasy, [**2198**] 5.
Posterior exam limited.
IP performed a flexible bronchoscopy which showed diffuse airway edema and friability, small partial RLL obstructing lesion, and a black lesion in the RUL consistent with invasive aspergillis.
Endobronchial biopsies were performed which eventually showed inflammatory changes and negative fungal stains.
CTA chest was negative for PE but revealed bilateral apical and perihilar ground glass opacities with septal thickening (edema vs. infection), RLL opacity, bilateral pleural effusions (R>L), and densely calcified lymph nodes suggesting prior granulomatous exposure.
On [**2201-2-12**], a thoracentesis was performed with the fluid consistent with transudate.
The pulmonary service felt she will need follow-up imaging within a month and possibly another bronchoscopy, for further evaluation into her underlying lung process.
Troponin leak: The patient ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69.
ECG showed antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations.
In the ICU, an echocardiogram was performed which revealed a normal EF.
Cardiology was consulted, who thought the initial EF estimate was due to poor echo windows and the NSTEMI due to demand ischemia from intercurrent illness.
It was felt that the patient would benefit from a cardiac catheterization to evaluate the coronary arteries.
Once stable and out of the ICU the patient underwent cardiac cath which showed normal coronary arteries, PA pressure 42/13/25, and PCWP 12.
This can be discontinued if her blood pressure is well-controlled on ramipril.
Diabetes: Blood sugars were maintained with RISS, and glargine.
This may need further adjustment as an outpatient once she has completed her taper.
Viokase 2-5 tabs TID with meals 14.
Nystop 100,000 [**Hospital1 **] PRN .
Viokase 2-5 tabs TID with meals 18.
Prednisone 10 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): 20mg [**Date range (1) 9187**] 10mg [**Date range (1) 15037**] 5mg [**Date range (1) 15038**].
You will need to continue your antibiotics to complete a 2 week course, continue to taper your steroids, and make sure to follow-up at the pulmonary clinic for further evaluation and management.
You also had a cardiac catheterization which showed no blockage of your coronary arteries, indicating it was likely you had a stress response and not a heart attack.
You can follow-up with your primary care doctor and continue to take your daily aspirin and blood pressure medications.
