Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR [**7-11**]:Endotracheal tube has been advanced, now terminating in standard position about 4.5 cm above the carina.

TTE ([**7-11**]) The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).

MICRO: [**2116-7-29**] HIV Viral Load: negative [**2116-7-29**] BCxr: NGTD [**2116-7-24**] C. diff assay: negative [**2116-7-11**] Sputum culture: LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Final [**2116-7-24**]):       LEGIONELLA PNEUMOPHILA, GROUP 1.
CXR and CT chest demonstrated a left lung consolidation.
Urine Legionella was positive, and sputum culture grew Legionella, consistent with serotype 1.
Blood cultures showed no growth.
Subsequently, his pressures were very well controlled, ranging mostly 150-170s and by time of discharge, 110-150s.
He underwent a secondary workup with a normal renal ultrasound.
Renin and aldosterone levels are still pending as of discharge as well as 24hr urine for metanephrines.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient developed acute kidney injury with creatinine as high as 4.0 in the setting of Legionella sepsis and prolonged hypotension.
His baseline creatinine is ~1.3 per OSH records (likely secondary to chronic hypertension and T2DM).
After transfer to the medicine floor, patient's creatinine to trend downwards and he was discharged with a creatinine level of 1.4.
His lung exam demonstrated bibasilar crackles, sacral edema and his CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.
His O2 saturation remained in the mid-90s on FM and RA.
By time of discharge, patient was 205.9 lbs (reports home weight of 213 lbs), lung exam was much improved, and he was sating 95-100% on RA.
# Anemia: Hct remained in the low 20s for much of his admission.
Labs were not suggestive of hemolysis, reticulocyte count was appropriately elevated and he was guaiac negative.
He was started on Iron and Vitamin C.  Repeat hematocrit can be checked at rehab in [**4-20**] days or sooner if there is concern for worsening anemia.
He remained a sliding scale throughout admission and his sugars were well controlled.
C. diff assay on [**7-24**] was negative.
# Low CD4: Likely due to his sepsis and severe infection, HIV antibody and viral load were negative this admission.
# Will need further titration of his antihypertensives # Will need follow-up arranged with his PCP after discharge from LTACH # Follow-up reinin and aldosterone levels as well as 24 hour urine for metanephrines for secondary HTN work-up.
# Will finish Flagyl/Levo [**Last Name (un) 10128**] on [**2116-8-3**] # Consider repeat hematocrit 5-7 days after discharge - discharge Hct was 21.8  Medications on Admission: Amlodipine 5mg Labetelol 200mg Lisinopril 40mg dialy Glyburide 5mg [**Hospital1 **] aldactone 100mg [**Hospital1 **] Metformin 1000 [**Hospital1 **] Torsemide 20mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.

Discharge Instructions: Hi Mr. [**Known firstname 112374**]  You were initially admitted to the hospital on [**7-10**] after developing nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia and suffering a fall.
You were transferred to the medicine service after your lung function improved and your blood pressure stabilized in order to further manage your Legionella pneumonia, acute renal failure, and severe hypertension.
For the rest of your admission, your blood pressure was controlled, your kidney function improved.
