She ruled out for ACS with by enzymes (MB 8 -> 7 -> 5; Trop 0.06 -> 0.07 -> 0.06) and EKG without acute ischemic changes but was found to have a BNP of 11K on admission.
She was assessed as having severe decompensated R-sided CHF and was diuresed with 40mg IV lasix in the ED but later that day experienced [**9-9**] back pain with desat to the 50's and was transferred to the CCU for close monitoring with HR in the 60's and BP's in the 90's.
She had ECHO on [**12-24**] which showed severe pulmonary hypertension, RV pressure overload, modestly depressed RV function, and LVEF of 55-65%.

Blood Cultures x 2: Pending MRSA Screen: Pending .
CXR Portable [**12-25**]: IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is present, along with a very small right pleural effusion, decreased since [**9-5**].
Previous mediastinal adenopathy documented on the chest CT in [**Month (only) 216**] is difficult to assess but probably has not worsened.
CXR Portable [**12-25**]: Tip of the new right internal jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
Severe pulmonary atrial enlargement, an indication of marked pulmonary arterial hypertension, aortic valvular calcification, which could be hemodynamically significant (particularly in setting of decreased LV filling), and severe, global coronary calcification were shown on a Chest CT in [**Month (only) 216**] [**2178**], discussed with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30814**] at the time of dictation.
CXR Portable [**12-27**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-25**], there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the upper clavicular level, approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.
TTE [**12-27**]:The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinisic right ventricular systolic function is more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-10-16**], biventricular systolic function has deteriorated and the heart rate is much higher.
Brief Hospital Course: 62F with hx of severe of pulm HTN, CAD s/p DES to Lcx/LAD in [**10/2177**], prior CVA s/p b/l CEA's, PVD, and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from OSH for evaluation and management of right-sided diastolic CHF exacerbation with background of severe pulmonary hypertension who rapidly decompensated and passed away despite maximal medical therapy.
# Right-sided Diastolic CHF Exacerbation: Pt with clinical evidence of rales halfway up lung fields, JVD, and peripheral edema on admission with CXR evidence of pulmonary edema and BNP 11,000 at OSH, and ECHO demonstrating fluid overloaded RV with S3 gallop on exam.
On arrival to the CCU, R IJ was placed without complications and she was started on sildenafil 20mg QID with the hope that pressor support and vasodilatation of the pulmonary vasculature would increase cardiac output and allow for gentle diuresis.
These medications were up and down titrated to try to achieve a stable blood pressure but this kept ranging from 70/40-140/50.
At this point the patient was on dopamine, norepinephrine and phenylephrine for BP support and BiPAP for respiratory support with BP in the 79/55-101/57 and O2 sat of 90%.
At this point the anesthesia attending was asked for assistance in placing an arterial line given the need for better blood pressure and oxygenation parameters.
At around 0100-0130 her BP began to drop, milrinone was stopped and vasopressin added.
Despite these 4 pressors her BP continued to drop.
After this she stabilized at around 0200 and remained with HR 120-130's and SBP 80-100's for the next several hours.
She has an abdominal ultrasound to look for possible ruptured AAA given report of acute onset low back pain at OSH but this was negative.
# Anuric Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 1.8 on admission with oliguria/near anuria, 0.6-0.7 at baseline.
Perhaps related to her mild-moderate COPD on CT (although re-assuring spirometry in records) or possibly recurrent embolic phenomena.
# COPD/Hypoxia: PT with mild-moderate COPD changes on most recent CT chest but with essentially normal PFT's.
# CAD: Pt with severe 3VD with prior [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to LCx and LAD in 8/[**2177**].
Non-ischemic EKG here on admission and at OSH.
Managed on HISS while in-house as well as lyrica and gabapentin prior to her hemodynamic compromise.
