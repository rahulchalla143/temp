His ARF was thought to be [**1-13**] renal hypoperfusion [**1-13**] diuretic therapy and poor PO intake but worsened despite IVF support.
On arrival here, the patient complained only of abdominal tightness, mild abdominal pain, and decreased appetite but denied any CP, SOB, N/V, HA, rash, cough, URI symptoms, dysuria, diarrhea, or constipation.

+ esophageal candidiasis   Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 42y/o M w/ EtOH cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis complicated by renal failure and massive fluid overload/ascites who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after a 1mo OSH admission for further management.
He was admitted with a discriminant function of 62 and a MELD score of 35 with bili 34, Cr 2.7, INR.1.8, albumin 2.9. .
He gradually improved with this therapy and his bilirubin declined from 34 on admission to 11 on discharge.
His INR remained stable around 1.6.
Mr [**Known lastname **] did have an EGD which revealed no varices.
HCV and HBV serologies were negative, RUQ US showed patent flow in hepatic and portal veins, no stones.
[**Doctor First Name **] was negative, and serum ceruloplasm was normal as was ferritin.
AFP was 1.9 and US showed no signs of hepatoma.
Mr [**Known lastname **] will eventually need a liver transplantation and the patient is aware of this, although his true understanding may be limited.
At several points in his hospitalization paracentesis was performed with approx 3-4L off per procedure (8g albumin/L replaced) and his creatinine would subsuquently rise and then gradually fall.
Renal was consulted on the patient and felt that he was in a likely pre-renal state with a component of ATN given his urine Na of 20 and a high urine output.
He was taken off midodrine/octreotide/albumin several days prior to dishcarge with stable renal function with a cr at 1.2-1.4.
CXR was very difficult to interpret due to his large ascites, poor lung volumes, and fluid overload.
Diagnostic paracentesis was persistantly negative (despite 1 contaminated specimen + for enterococcus w/o WBC that was repeated and was negative).
Blood and urine cultures were also negative persistantly as was C diff.
EGD during his hospital course revealed esophageal candidiasis and he was started on fluconazole.
