HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60 year old white male, flight attendant, who presents with acute onset of worst headache of his life developed while leaning over to  He went to the [**Hospital6 33**] in [**Location (un) **] where a CT scan was positive for subarachnoid blood in the medial left superior cerebellar area raising the question of a superior cerebellar artery versus a posterior communicating artery aneurysm versus an arteriovenous malformation.
The initial subarachnoid hemorrhage in [**2153**], did occur while the patient was on Coumadin for report of previous deep vein thrombosis.
Vital signs revealed blood pressure 157/91, respiratory rate 16, heart rate 70 normal sinus rhythm, oxygen saturation 100% on two liters nasal cannula at the time of admission.
Abdominal examination showed bowel sounds to be positive in all four quadrants.
Sensory examination was intact.
Deep tendon reflexes were intact throughout and equal bilaterally.
Finger to nose and heel to shin were within normal limits.
LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission, laboratories showed a hematocrit of 46.2, white blood cell count of 9.6, platelet count 204,000.
Coagulation studies revealed prothrombin time 13.2, partial thromboplastin time 26.3 and INR 1.1.
Chem7 was within normal limits as was a calcium, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and liver enzymes.
Review of the CT scan from [**Hospital6 33**] showed positive blood in the left superior cerebellar area consistent with a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  A CT angiogram was performed on the night of admission which raised the question of a small arteriovenous malformation and due to the clinical and radiographic findings, the patient was taken to the angiogram suite for formal diagnostic angiogram on the morning of [**2164-2-8**], where an angiogram confirmed the presence of an arteriovenous malformation.
The patient was maintained in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit during the early phase of his hospitalization where blood pressure was controlled to keep the systolic blood pressure within normal limits.
The patient was taken back to the angiogram suite on [**2164-2-10**], where the patient underwent an angiogram and NBCA adhesive embolization of one of the superior cerebellar feeder vessels to the arteriovenous malformation.
Postangiographic physical examination showed some mild decreased strength in the right arm and, for this reason, the patient was taken for an urgent head CT scan which showed no area of infarct or bleed.
He was transferred to the floor on [**2164-2-13**], and an echocardiogram was obtained on [**2164-2-14**], to assess heart function and the conclusions of this echocardiogram were pending at the time of dictation of the summary.
with instructions to hold the Lopressor for a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 or a heart rate less than 60.
