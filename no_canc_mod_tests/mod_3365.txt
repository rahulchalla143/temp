His cardiac enzymes were negative and his electrolytes were not derranged; His other labs were simply notable for a low hct of 27.1. .
Past Medical History: #HTN # dilated CMP with EF 40-45% in setting of AFib; last EF 60% # atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion in [**2151**] and [**2153**] # 1st degree AV block; symptomatic bradycardia on atenolol # tonsillar CA s/p 3x cisplatin and XRT (finished [**12-22**]) # peripheral neuropathy # diabetes type 2 non-insulin-dependent; c/b peripheral neuropathy and toe amputations; chronic venous insufficiency with chronic LE cellulitis # recent tonsillar CA ?currently undergoing chemo/XRT?
Social History: lives in [**Location **] with wife  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: T BP 120/66 HR 81 (sinus) RR 14, 98% Gen: Intubated, sedated, morbidly obese.
Opens eyes to command CV: RRR no m/r/g; decreased heart sounds Pulm: clear anteriorly Abd: obese, s/nd/nt + BS, PEG in place (non-functional Ext: B chronic venous changes, trace edema B   Pertinent Results: EP study showed scar and many foci were ablated with some success, but residual foci.
cardiac cath had LAD stenosis and bare metal stent was placed.
Changed to an altered morphology and some polymorphic variation s/p 1x ablation.
EP study on [**1-14**]- Several different morphologies of VT were noted, generally not well-tolerated hemodynamically which limited the ability to map the arrhythmia.
A substrate based ablation was performed which modified but did not completely eliminate the VT. Post-ablation, the pt was treated with metoprolol, amiodarone, and mexilitine.
BEcause of the concern re: ischemia contributing to the episodes of arrhythmia, the pt underwent cardiac catheterization (see below).
Agressive resuscitative measures were performed but the pt had persistent and recurrent arrhythmia that was not hemodynamically tolerated and did not respond to repeated attempts at defibrillation.
ECG during brief sinus rhythm during code did not demonstrate ST elevation or any evidence of acute stent thrombosis.
CAD: Reduced EF, and findings at EP study consistent with CAD (regional scar), although cardiac enzymes persistantly negative.
Had cath and bare metal stent to prox LAD which markedly reduced the amount of arrhythmia he was having.
Head CT without bleed or infarct.
Thick secretions still ([**1-13**] parotid after surgery); improved on humidified oxygen.
# Tonsillar Cancer: tonsillar CA s/p 3x cisplatin ([**2155-11-3**], [**2155-11-24**], [**2155-12-15**]) and XRT (finished [**12-22**]).
