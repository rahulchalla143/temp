Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Outpatient Lab Work basic chemistry panel in [**9-8**] days to evaluate creatinine and potassium after initiation of ACE inhibitor.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] of [**Location (un) 583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation 2. possible atypical pneumonia   Discharge Condition: stable, on room air, with stable blood pressures in the 110-120 systolic range for greater than 24 hours.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Fluid Restriction: less than two liters each day.
Your creatinine and potassium should be checking in the next 10-14 days because you have started an ace inhibitor.
