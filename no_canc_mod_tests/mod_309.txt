The patient arrived to the Emergency Room in rapid atrial fibrillation with a blood pressure in the 80s and was started on intravenous fluids.
Initial electrocardiograms showed no significant ST or T wave changes.
Her first CK was 48, her component was 2.7, her potassium was 2.5.
She has a history of a congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in [**2107-1-31**] showing concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 50%.
Her baseline creatinine is approximately 1.4.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission her vital signs were temperature of 98.6, heartrate 109, blood pressure 130/78, breathing 24 times per minute.
She was vented on assist control, 500 cc by 12 with 60% FIO2 and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
Initial examination was an elderly intubated woman who was sedated.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination showed her to be normocephalic, atraumatic with bilateral surgical pupils.
Neck examination was supple with no jugulovenous distension appreciated.
Cardiac examination showed a right ventricular heave.
Her chest examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her extremities showed trace peripheral edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  Her laboratory data on admission showed a white count of 14.4, hematocrit of 33.4, platelets of 83.
Chem-7 showed sodium of 146, potassium 2.5, chloride of 107, bicarbonate 18, BUN 19 and creatinine 1.5 with a glucose of 140.
Her INR was 2.0, her PTT was 37.2.
Initial CK was 48 with a negative MB and a troponin of 2.7.
Urinalysis revealed no red cells, no white cells and no casts.
Chest x-ray on admission showed cardiomegaly with a calcified aorta.
Electrocardiogram showed an atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and infrequent ectopy.
She received a chest and abdominal computerized tomography scan showing no aortic aneurysm.
Head computerized tomography scan showed periventricular white matter changes but no acute bleed.
The patient did not go for cardiac catheterization as this was felt to be a primary arrhythmogenic event.
The patient had an arterial blood gases with pH of 7.34, pCO2 of 41, pO2 of 273 on the above mentioned settings.
The patient underwent bedside electroencephalogram to evaluate for neural activity as well as potential seizure activity.
Initial electroencephalogram readings suggested that she was having seizure activity and on hospital day #2 went into a nonconvulsive status epilepticus status.
With therapeutic levels of Valproate and Phenobarbital she was felt to have control of her epileptic activity.
She has remained cardiovascularly stable with blood pressures running 110 to 150, well controlled on antihypertensives.
It was elected to defer any further electrophysiologic study at this time given the approximate cause of a low potassium.
