His urine output was 3500 cc during the case and it was completed with the patient being brought to the Intensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stabilized yet critical condition.
The thought by cardiology evaluation to be a non Q wave myocardial infarction versus an isolated troponin leak and the patient was maintained on Lopressor.
He had an echocardiogram evaluation that showed an EF function of 30% with an akinetic anterior wall during this acute period.
The patient continued to be in guarded condition until postoperative day seven and five during which time he had a repeat CAT scan, which showed there was a significant amount of blood approximately 1 liter in an area behind the liver.
He underwent a biopsy of his liver at this time as well and it was thought to not be a complicated case.
The patient's biopsy revealed that there was no rejection and no ductal cholestasis.
On primary evaluation in the Operating Room he did not appear to have any ductal leak, but the surgeons were maintaining a close eye for this finding.
For this reason neurology was consulted and he was thought to have a electroencephalogram not consistent with seizure activity and MRI with old periventricular white matter changes.
This was associated with transaminases of AST of 20, ALT of 30, alkaline phosphatase of 251 and an albumin of 2.4.
The patient's coags were significant at this time for an INR of 1.4 and a PTT of 27 and his white blood cell count had indeed come down as well from a high of 16.8 to 11.3.
His hematocrit at this time was stable in the 27 to 28 range with platelets of 124.
The patient's BUN and creatinine were 38 and .9 respectively with controlled potassium at 4.4.
On [**2167-6-29**] the patient underwent an ultrasound, which revealed that he had normal pulsatile flow through the porta and on [**7-2**] he had a cholangiogram, which indicated that he had a dilated proximal duct with some extravasation.
This was followed up by a CAT scan and also evidenced extravasation of contrast.
He underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2167-7-7**], which showed that he had an anastomotic leak and evidenced such clearly enough to place a stent that was 7 cm by 10 French Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent through the site of anastomosis.
Cholangiogram repeated on [**2167-7-8**] evidenced no leak at the anastomosis.
The patient had this followed by a HIDA scan, which again evidenced no leak and had minimal 16 minute normal transient time of contrast to the small bowel.
On [**2167-7-11**] his T bili was 1.1 with an alkaline phosphatase of 424, AST of 39 and ALT of 80.
This was accompanied by white blood cell count of 11, hematocrit now 31.9 and platelets of 164.
It should be noted that during the time the patient was having these resolving liver function issues his Cyclosporin level was elevated as high as 563.
He had perioperative encephalopathy, which had resolved.
He took Actigall 300 mg po t.i.d., Univasc 7.5 mg po q day to be held for SBP less then 100, Lopresor 12.5 mg po b.i.d.
to be held for SBP less then 100 and a heart rate less then 60, aspirin 81 mg po q day.
He had the above noted imaging studies that confirmed that he no longer had any biliary system leak and his hematocrit had been stable for some time.
