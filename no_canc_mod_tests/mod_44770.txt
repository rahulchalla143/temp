She had a head CT yesterday which showed multiple ring enhancing lesion.
Pathology showed mild IBD.

She had been in rehab in CT for her femur fx in [**9-/2183**] and subsequently living with daughter in CT for further rehab; moved back with her husband prior to her recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2184-2-15**].
Language: Speech fluent with good comprehension, following commands, able to repeat  Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2 mm bilaterally, fundoscopic - no papilledema, Visual fields are full to confrontation.

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2184-4-7**]  3:45:24 PM Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2184-3-2**] lateral ST-T wave changes are more prominent on the current tracing.
[**4-7**] MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
[**4-7**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) FINDINGS:  The patient has received a right PICC line.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2184-4-8**] 11:51 AM  IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited examination due to patient motion, functional MRI sequences of the brain were cancelled due to lack of patient cooperation.
DTI tractography images demonstrate significant deviation of the corticospinal fibers and association fibers; however, apparently there is evidence of cortical spinal tracts adjacent to this mass lesion.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2184-4-9**] 4:44 AM    IMPRESSION: 1.
Pre-operative planning study with stable multiseptated, multiloculated peripherally enhancing lesion in left temporoparietal lobe with associated significant perilesional edema causing mass effect on the atrium and body of left lateral ventricle.
[**4-9**] CT head postop: Status post craniotomy and drainage of left parietal abscesses with small amount of post procedural intraparenchymal and extra-axial hemorrhage and unchanged vasogenic edema without evidence of significant mass effect.
Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal.
[**4-14**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
On [**2184-4-7**] the patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service to the SICU additional evaluation and treatment.
The patient had a brain MRI with and without contrast to assess the extent ofthe multiple brain abscesses which was consistent with multiseptated, multiloculated peripherally enhancing lesion in left temporoparietal lobe is suggestive of an abscess with associated significant perilesional edema causing mass effect on the atrium and body of left lateral ventricle.
A functional MRI was performed as this lesion is near her motor and speech centers of her brain because she is right-handed and left hemisphere dominate which was consistent with limited examination due to patient motion, functional MRI sequences of the brain were cancelled due to lack of patient cooperation.
DTI tractography images demonstrate significant deviation of the corticospinal fibers and association fibers; however, apparently there is evidence of cortical spinal tracts adjacent to this mass lesion.
Would cover gram positive organismsby adding vancomycin to her regimen, and  would monitor vancomycin levels and renal function.
Based on the results of new brain aspiration, would adjust antibiotics accordingly, possibly to cover more resistant gram negative rods or to cover yeast or other atypical pathogens.
On [**4-9**], A Wand MRI was performed for OR planning.
Postoperative head CT demonstrated no postoperative hemorrhage.
She remained intubated until after a postoperative MRI could be obtained on [**4-10**].
She was repleted in the AM via IV for a Potassium of 2.8.
Repeat evening K was 3.4 for which she was repleted orally with a plan to recheck in the AM.
TTE was obtained on [**4-14**] which demonstrated a normal EF of 55% with no evidence of vegetations.
Vancomycin levels should be followed to maintain a goal trough level of 15-20.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
You will need a CT scan of the brain with and without contrast.
