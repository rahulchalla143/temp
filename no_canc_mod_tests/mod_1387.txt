Exam was notable for right humerus fracture in splint, no ecchymoses, abdomen soft, non-tender.
Labs were notable for HCt of 26 from previous 34.
Vital signs prior to transfer HR 114, 153/68, 98% on 3L NC.
Her syncope was attributed to multiple BP meds and volume depletion.
Ventricular blood products and subarachnoid blood products as well as inferior right frontal lobe hemorrhage and contusion, minor changes of small-vessel ischemic disease and brain atrophy, chronic infarcts in the pons and middle cerebral pedicle.

Imaging: CXR [**2137-5-27**] IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, although an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2137-5-28**] 12:03 AM STUDY: Chest CTA and CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast; MDCT images were generated through the chest without IV contrast.
Subsequent MDCT images were generated through the chest after the administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast in the pulmonary arterial phase.
Subsequent MDCT images were generated through the abdomen and pelvis using the same contrast bolus in the venous phase.
The lungs demonstrate ground-glass opacity of the inferolateral portion of the right upper lobe, which may represent an area of infarct (5A; 56).
Compression deformities of T12 and T9, while chronic appearing, no comparison study is available to assess for stability; correlate with exam.
- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2137-5-28**] 2:07 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2137-5-28**] 11:38 PM Final Report INDICATION: 86-year-old female with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, now on heparin for pulmonary embolus.
COMPARISON: Serial CT examinations between [**2137-5-7**] and [**2137-5-28**] at 2:07.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous non-contrast axial images were obtained through the brain.
The ventricles and sulci remain prominent, consistent with age-related involutional changes.
Pulmonary embolism, lower extremity DVT: Significant clot burden.
No RHS seen on CT, however, no echo done.
ECG shows some signs of RHS, but c/w prior, CTA without signs of RH strain.
Hypercoagulable studies were not sent given that this was a provoked DVT likely secondary to her immobility.
She will need to continue to remain on a heparin gtt with a goal PTT between 60-100 until her INR has been stable between [**12-27**] fofr 48 hours.
# Previous Intra-ventricular hemorrhage, SAH: Per neurosurg recs, benefits of anti-coagulation outweigh risk since bleed appeared stable on repeat head CT on [**2137-5-28**].
She is scheduled for a repeat head CT and a follow up appointment in the neurosurgery clinic after discharge.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease/inflammation.
Her Hct was monitored and was stable at 26 on the day of discharge.
Metoprolol was continued throughout hospitalization, lisinopril was initially held for renal protection after CT with IV contrast and then resumed.
BP was stable in 130s-140s on day of discharge.
7. calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO BID (2 times a day).
11. heparin (porcine) in NS 10,000 unit/1,000 mL Parenteral Solution Sig: Per attached sliding scale  Intravenous Per sliding scale: Continue until therapeutic INR on warfarin for 48 hours.
12. warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Please continue to monitor INR daily, therapeutic goal 2.0-3.0.
Fleet Enema 19-7 gram/118 mL Enema Sig: One (1) enema Rectal once a day as needed for constipation.
You had a CT scan of your chest which showed a blood clot in your lungs.
You were seen by the neurology service because of your history of a head bleed, and a repeat CT scan of your head showed that this bleed was stable.
We made the following changes to your medications: -STARTED IV heparin drip (per sliding scale instructions) -- continue until INR therapeutic (2.0-3.0) on warfarin for 48 hours -STARTED warfarin by mouth 5mg daily or adjusted as needed for therapeutic INR (2.0-3.0) -- continue for 3 months -STARTED Calcium Carbonate 500 mg by mouth twice a day -STARTED Vitamin D 800 UNIT by mouth daily -CHANGE you dose of Remeron to 7.5 mg at nighttime as needed for sleep (previously you had been taking it every night)   We made no other changes to your medications.
