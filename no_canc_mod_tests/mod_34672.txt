GCS was 3 on the scene.
Motor: No motor response to noxious stimuli throughout.
Head CT([**6-27**]): NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is a new right convexity epidural hematoma extending up to 2.1 cm from the inner table.
Head CT [**6-28**]: Since the prior study, there appears to be essentially complete evacuation of the right middle cranial fossa epidural hematoma, with resolution of previously noted leftward subfalcine herniation.
Head CT [**6-29**] 1.
CT HEAD [**7-6**]  FINDINGS: Post-surgical changes from prior right craniotomy, with evacuation of right middle cranial fossa epidural hematoma and large left craniectomy are similar.
Hypodense areas are noted between the brain and the flap (series 2, im 21) and between the flap and the subcutaneous tissues of the flap measuing about -1 to 2.5HU and may represent fat or less likely fluid.

A post-operative head CT showed the development of a new right epidural hematoma.
He emergently returned to the OR and underwent a craniectomy for evacuation of the right epidural hematoma.
Patient was monitored closely with neuro checks Q1hr.
A post-op head CT showed essentially complete evacuation of the right middle cranial fossa epidural hematoma, with resolution of previously noted leftward subfalcine herniation.
His neuro exam continued to improve daily, with R>L withdrawal progressing to purposeful movement on the right.
His urine and blood cultures have been negative, and there was no clear evidence of an aspiration PNA.
