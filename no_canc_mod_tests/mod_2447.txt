LABS ON DISCHARGE ([**5-14**]): 136  102  19 ------------< 115 4.5  27  1.0  Ca: 9.0 Mg: 1.9 P: 4.3 ALT: 675 AP: 129 Tbili: 0.4 AST: 327  CBC: MCV 85 5.3 > 13.6< 281       40.1  Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 14637**] is a 36 yo male with history of HIV last CD4: 627, VL: 2,880 copies/ml who presented with epigastric dyscomfort and recent onset DOE and was found to have previously unknown dilated cardiomyopathy with EF ~10% in setting of febrile illness.
His TTE showed an EF of [**10-12**]%, which was likely overestimated in the setting of 2+MR.
Differential dx for dCMP was broad - ischemic, infectious, toxic, inherited/genetic, left ventricular non-compaction, endocrine, nutritional deficiency.
In this patient, it was felt the most likely etiology was infecious vs. toxic (though HIV is correlated with premature CAD, patient was without evidence on EKG of prior ischemic insult & on this admission biomarkers were negative; also CD4 count and relatively low VL argued against this primary etiology).
His CBC was notable for WBC wnl and no left shift; he had no localized complaints.
He underwent TTE as above w/o visible vegetations.
Blood cultures were negative with the exception of one culture from [**5-9**] which grew GPCs in clusters felt to be Peptostrep; this was felt to be a contaminant as all other cultures were negative.
He underwent an extensive infectious work up including crypto, toxo, CMV, EBV, hepatitis serologies, [**Location (un) **], RPR, Lyme, HSV1&2 and parvovirus.
PPD was negative.
PPD was planted and was negative.
# Hepatitis C. HCV VL positive at 14,100, but Ab negative.
HCV genotype was sent and was pending on discharge.
Likely benign diffuse lymphadenopathy of HIV disease- no further imaging was pursued but patient will benefit from close clinical follow up and potential CT torso to assess for pathologic enlargement.

An ultrasound of your heart was performed which showed dilation of your heart which we believe may be due to your use of methamphetamines.
