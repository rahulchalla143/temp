Patient was admitted with CBG of 383 and AG 17.
HA and N/V likely related to elevated BP (consistent with prior episodes), CT negative for acute intracranial process.
Her BP was in goal range (SBP 140-150) on transfer from the ICU but increased to 180/100 on the morning of [**2150-8-5**].
On transfer to the floor patient appeared euvolemic with clear lung exam and no peripheral edema so lasix was held in light of her worsening renal function.
Renal ultrasound [**3-/2150**] showed worsening parenchymal disease, UPEP was normal.
Urine output remained adequate, u/a positive for glucose, ketones and protein, negative for infection.
Repeat troponins stablized, CK-MB were trended and negative.
FXR was negative for osteo.
