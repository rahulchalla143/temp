HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year old female with a history of significant coronary artery disease and ejection fraction of less than 15% who, on the day of admission, was in her usual state of health until around 10 p.m. when she was sitting in a chair and felt increasing shortness of breath with associates increase in heart rate and palpitations.
The EMS arrived and found patient to be in moderate respiratory distress with respiratory rate in the 30s and oxygen saturations in the mid-80s.
The patient was successfully extubated ten hours after admission with resultant oxygen saturations to 96% on room air.
Coronary artery disease with ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% per [**2146-8-17**] echocardiogram.
Non-Q wave myocardial infarction in [**2146-8-17**] (the patient refused cardiac catheterization at that time); two plus mitral regurgitation with severe left ventricular hypokinesis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs upon admixing were temperature of 99.4 F.; heart rate 70; blood pressure 118/59; respirations 17; oxygenation 96% on room air.
Pulmonary is clear to auscultation bilaterally with no evidence of crackles, rhonchi or wheezing.
LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 8.7 with 60% neutrophils, 33% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 3% eosinophils.
Hematocrit 34.3, MCV 90, platelets 183.
Chem-7 with sodium 133, potassium 4.6, chloride 98, bicarbonate 22, BUN 25, creatinine 1.1, glucose 140, CK 47, troponin less than 0.03.
Arterial blood gas at time of admission while intubated is 7.29, 49, 226.
EKG at time of admission is normal sinus rhythm with prolonged QRS at 200 meloschisis.
Chest x-ray at time of admission is gross pulmonary edema with question opacification of left retrocardiac area  Urinalysis positive nitrites, small leukocyte esterase, zero to two white blood cells, many bacteria, zero red blood cells.
Cardiovascular:  The patient with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 15% per [**2146-8-17**] echocardiogram.
There was a question of possible infiltrate causing hypoxia and dyspnea, however, with intravenous diuresis a repeat chest x-ray did not reveal any focal infiltrate.
She ruled out with CK of 192, 197, 47, with CK MB 7, 9 and troponin of 0.9 and 0.3.
As the patient had refused cardiac catheterization in the past, this was again discussed and the patient again refused elective catheterization.
At time of discharge, her oxygen saturations remained stable between 94 and 98% on room air.
A repeat PA and lateral chest x-ray was done to rule out infiltrate status post diuresis which revealed no infiltrates.
Her fever curve and white blood cell count were monitored throughout this hospitalization and remained negative.
A repeat urine culture was drawn given a positive nitrites with increased bacteria in her urinalysis.
Urine culture, however, remained negative at time of discharge.
Fingerstick blood sugars were performed four times a day and glucose remained in good control.
The patient refused regular insulin sliding scale but however, never had a fingerstick blood sugar greater than 200.
Renal:  The patient's BUN and creatinine remained stable with diuresis, hovering around a baseline of 0.9 to 1.3.
The patient had excellent urine output and a Foley catheter was discontinued prior to discharge.
