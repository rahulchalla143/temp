Workup at [**Hospital3 7362**] was significant for an electrocardiogram which showed an first heart sound Q3/T3 pattern on her Emergency Room electrocardiogram.
She subsequently had a perfusion scan which was read out as normal (per report).
She also had a CT of the abdomen and a HIDA scan which revealed a bile leak.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and further management of her bile leak.
The patient was brought to the Gastroenterology Suite where an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed under general anesthesia.
She had oxygen saturations around 85%.
q.d., psyllium, Dilaudid, and Percocet.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Her admission examination to the Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] pressure was 110/60, heart rate was 95 (in sinus), respiratory rate was 18 to 22, oxygen saturation was 91% to 94% on 100% nonrebreather.
She also had a temperature to 101.8.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Her laboratories on admission to the Intensive Care Unit included complete [**Last Name (Titles) **] count with white [**Last Name (Titles) **] cell count of 18, hematocrit was 37.4, platelets were 476.
Her Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 137, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 97, bicarbonate was 22, [**Last Name (Titles) **] urea nitrogen was 13, creatinine was 0.7, [**Last Name (Titles) **] glucose was 198.
Coagulations revealed PT was 14.6, PTT was 27.8, INR was 1.5.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Her chest x-ray on admission to the Intensive Care Unit that night (AP portable) showed a small right effusion, [**Last Name (un) 16765**] B-lines, and pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with congestive heart failure.
Her electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia at 110, with normal axis and normal intervals.
Compared to the electrocardiogram from [**Hospital3 7362**], she did have upright T waves across the precordium; which, when compared to the other electrocardiogram, was new.
She had other laboratories drawn which came back significant for cardiac enzymes with creatine kinase times three were flat at 36, 58, and 38.
Subjectively, the patient was feeling much better throughout her course in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and her supplemental oxygen was weaned from an initial 35% face mask down to 2 liters nasal cannula, and ultimately to off; during which she remained 99% oxygen saturation even on room air.
The patient received an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of greater than 50%.
Pulmonary artery pressures were not able to be determined.
The patient also received a CT of the chest; both for looking at the possibility of a pulmonary embolism as well as to look at her lung parenchyma.
She was also scheduled for a stress test with nuclear imaging on [**9-13**] at 4:30 at the [**Last Name (un) 469**] Center to help delineate the etiology of any potential cardiac problems.
