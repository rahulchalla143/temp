Blood cultures and wound cultures were drawn, and the patient was started on vancomycin.
Today, the patient went for hemodialysis and was noted to have [**2-28**] positive blood cultures that grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and a wound culture that grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient was also noted to have a blood sugar of 39 and was given a half ampule of D-50.
Her INR which on Friday was noted to be 2.9 was measured as 7.4 and later greater than 11.5.
The patient was also noted to have an evaluated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
The patient became unresponsive on the surgery floor and was noted to have systolic blood pressures in the 70s; reportedly baseline is between 80 and 90.
The patient was bolused with intravenous fluids which increased the systolic blood pressure to the 80s and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer observation of blood pressures.
Status post catheterization in [**2108-12-28**] which showed 3-vessel disease and required a percutaneous coronary intervention of the left anterior descending artery.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%; catheterization showed severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
Temperature was 97.1, blood pressure was 87/48, pulse was 74, respiratory rate was 17, pulse oximetry was 98% on 2 liters.
Lung examination revealed poor respiratory effort, diffuse rales.
Extremities revealed trace edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses on the left, a right below-knee amputation.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories were pertinent for an elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin; most of which was total bilirubin which was measured at 3.
It was felt that the patient likely had intervascular infection and at some point would need an echocardiogram; or at some point evaluation to see if her dialysis catheter was infected.
However, it appeared that she had gone into congestive heart failure to some extent as her chest x-ray showed signs of fluid overload.
