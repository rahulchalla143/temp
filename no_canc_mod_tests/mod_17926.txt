She was taken to an OSH where a CT scan of the neck revealed a C2 fracture.
Neurosurgery evaluation at [**Hospital1 18**] recommended conservative management.
Initial trauma workup revealed widened mediastinum on chest x ray.
Follow-up CT of the torso was consistent with leaking infrarenal AAA.

Blood in the retroperitoneal cavity is consistent with leak.
Mediastinal widening on previous chest x-ray was likely related to an overabundance of mediastinal fat and bilateral dependent atelectasis.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-12-1**] 1:04 PM IMPRESSION: Mildly displaced acute C2 fracture extending through both lateral masses and into the posteroinferior portion of the odontoid.
If this is a clinical concern, then an MR examination with axial T1 images and an MRA are recommended.
CT lacks soft tissue contrast resolution to exclude ligamentous injury or disk or hematoma compromising the canal.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2187-12-27**] IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the focused TEE study of [**2187-12-2**] (images reviewed), the LV systolic function has improved, and there is now a pericardial effusion, as described above.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted after initial evaluation in trauma ED for emergent ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of vascular surgery.
A flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed that confirmed this diagnosis intially and general surgery followed the patient as she resolved from this condition.
Later in her hospitalization urine cultures revealed yeast, proteus and klebsiella for which she was treated as well.
The patient was asymptomatic from this and it was deemed that no further work-up was necessary unless hypotension developed.
A repeat echocardiography was recommended as follow-up (1week).
