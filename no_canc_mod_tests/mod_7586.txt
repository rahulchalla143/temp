MRI performed during this admission showed no acute territorial infarct within the brain, but did show scattered old lacunar infarcts within the cerebellar hemispheres, and chronic periventricular white matter changes that were noted were seen as evidence of stroke.
An extensive workup was done to evaluate whether her symptoms could be due to other causes (detailed in Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discharge summary from [**2137-10-23**]), but all tests returned negative, and therefore the diagnosis of a small pontine stroke which was not seen on MRI is the most likely possibility.
Interestingly, an echocardiogram from [**2137-10-23**] revealed a small secundum atrial septal defect, but left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
2) Hypertension Diagnosed when she was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2137-10-19**] for likely lacunar stroke (blood pressure was 184/90 upon admission).
Blood pressure was noted to be elevated at visits subsequent to the visit (140/70, 160/80).
Blood pressure currently controlled with Lisinopril 20mg PO qday.
3) Borderline diabetes Patient reports that she was told that her blood glucose was elevated when admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2137-10-19**].
She checked her sugars at home for some time after discharge, but they were never elevated, so about one year ago she stopped checking her sugars at home.
4) Hyperlipidemia Lipid panel during [**2137-10-19**] admission revealed LDL elevated at 117.
LDL (calculated) was last measured at 72 in [**2138-11-19**] and then 126 in [**2139-3-19**].
Head tremor, which she has, is more likely to be a manifestation of essential tremor, whereas tremor of the jaw or lips is more typically parkinsonian.

Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ([**2139-5-7**] at 9:30pm, upon transfer from SICU to floor): Vitals: T 99.1, BP 108/35, HR 70, RR 19, O2 sat 97% General: Sitting up in bed, mild rhythmic facial tremor.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, anteriorly, without wheezes or rhonchi Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, without palpable masses Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, edema GU: Foley catheter in place, draining dark yellow urine  NEUROLOGIC EXAM([**2139-5-7**] at 9:30pm, upon transfer from SICU to floor): Mental Status: Patient is awake, alert, and fully oriented.
Repetition is [**4-22**] and recall [**3-22**] at 5 minutes ([**4-22**] with multiple choice).

Head CT [**5-6**]: Probable tiny chronic small vessel infarct in the right periatrial white matter.
MRI scanning recommended for better detection of a seizure focus.
Head CTA [**5-6**]: No definite signs for basilar artery stenosis or occlusion.
Head MR/MRA [**5-6**]: No acute infarct.
Head MR [**5-7**]:  No significant change since prior study.
She was hemoconcentrated (hematocrit 52.1) and acidotic (bicarb 13 with anion gap of 29) upon arrival; both of these abnormalities were resolved on the morning of [**5-7**] after IV hydration.
Cardiac enzymes drawn to rule out MI returned normal.
CXR revealed no evidence of cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Urine and blood toxicology screens were negative.
MRI, MRA, CT, and CTA showed no evidence of acute infarct, mass, or vascular abnormality.
EEG showed delta slowing but no epileptiform discharges.
Neurological and physical examination were normal on the morning of [**2139-5-8**], and physical therapy evaluation was obtained to make sure the patient would be able to walk on her own steadily once discharged.
Since the EEG was negative as well as the MRI, there is no obvious focus for the seizures.
