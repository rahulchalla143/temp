ADDENDUM: per conversation w/ [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP on [**2-15**]: Pt had ICD placed at end of [**Month (only) 359**], presented mid/end of [**Month (only) 1096**] w/ SOB/CP - found to have pericarditis [**2-6**] to procedure, put into right heart failure (most recent ECHO EF 30%) intubated for several weeks.
Med list and recent D/C summary will be faxed to SICU (CC6C) but [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] pt is on Cozar 50, Lopressor XR 100, Synthroid, Clonopin 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **], ASA, Zoloft 50.
CHF with EF 40% on [**4-/2169**]; 30% on [**1-11**].
Pertinent Results: Chest U/S [**2-15**]: Small fluid collection in the region of left chest wall pacemaker.
CXR [**2-15**]: Slight increase in right hazy lower lung zone opacity representing pleural effusion.
Echo [**2-15**]: Suboptimal image quality.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-2-12**], the left ventricular systolic function is slightly improved.
Right ventricular cavity size, systolic function and estimated PA systolic pressure are similar.
CT head [**2-14**]: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarct.
CT abd/pelvis [**2-14**]: CT OF THE PELVIS:  Sigmoid colon and rectum are decompressed, with sigmoid diverticulosis.
CT ABD: Nonspecific colonic wall thickening involving the splenic flexure, raising the possibility of ischemic colitis from a low-flow state in this watershed region.
Diverticulosis of the right, left, and sigmoid colon.
CXR [**2-14**]: No definite areas of consolidation, although if indicated right lower lobe opacity may be followed with repeat PA and lateral chest x- ray.

A CT was performed and found circumferential thickening around the colon at the splenic flexure, concerning for watershed ischemia of the colon.
Less likely was the possibility of infectious colitis, given that the patient had some diarrhea and a WBC count with a left shift, however, she was afebrile throughout the hospital stay and the clinical presentation was more consistent with chronic abdominal pain and the incidental finding of ischemic colitis, likely an old event.
Blood, stool cultures, O&P lab studies were pending at discharge, and we will notify your institution if they are positive.
Urine tests to evaluate for the possibility of a UTI causing abdominal pain were negative.
Initially, the LFTs were increased (AST:ALT) c/w possible alcoholic liver disease but no ETOH was present in serum, the specimen was hemolyzed, and repeat LFTs were normal.
We monitored her abdominal exams serially in conjunction with surgery, who felt that the patient did not have acute ischemic colitis.
# Systolic heart failure: Her exam was notable for some evidence of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, including elevated JVP, LE edema, crackles on exam, and an elevated BNP.
An echo on [**2-12**] showed an EF of 45%.
# Chest wall fluid collection: Pt had an area of erythema and warmth over the ICD site.
A chest wall U/S showed a tiny fluid collection in the region of the AICD.
The patient did not endorse tenderness and exam was not significant for fluctuance, so we do not think this represents active infection, but this should be monitored.
#Leg laceration: She sustained a laceration after a fall, which was sutured in the emergency department.
An xray of the leg was grossly unremarkable without evidence of subcutaneous emphysema or soft tissue loss.
