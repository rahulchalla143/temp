CT showed diffuse interstitial changes thought to be secondary to rheumatoid-associated lung disease.
Labs were significant for a normal WBC with 60% PMNs, XX% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes and 4% eosinophils.
His echo revealed a normal EF of 55% with moderate to severe TR and moderately elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
EKG showed an rate of 60 with old RBBB and right axis deviation.
Though his symptoms did improve, repeat CT showed worsening of left lung process and patient was not able to be weaned off oxygen.
He was transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] for lung biopsy and further evaluation and management.

His CXR at the time of re-intubation looks dramatically worse than the prior CXR altough we have already been able to wean FiO2.
Small PTX on am CXR - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24 hrs.
- appreciate thorasics input - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX .
- check b12, folate, iron studies - trend for now - guaiac all stools .
PPX: Sc heparin, bowel regimen prn, ranitidine -- [**5-31**] - path c/w UIP - discussed with rheum: hold humira x2wk post vats, hold mtx indefinitely - staph from sputum sensitivities pending .
[**5-31**] - weaned steroid down to 60mg methylpred - increased ptx on AM CXR but thoracics ok with keeping on water seal - attempted to reach outpt rheum - no answer from office.
would HOLD mtx indefinitely and defer further tx choices to outpt rheum - path prelim c/w UIP, discussed with family - vanc trough 7, increased to 1g [**Hospital1 **] from 750mg [**Hospital1 **] - seen by speech and swallow failed swallow -> made npo .
[**6-1**] - increased PTX, changed CT to suction from water seal - changed zosyn dosing - MIE Q2H, chest PT - NG tube placed, pulled out of position with question aspiration event, replaced .
[**6-3**] - chest tube put on waterseal again in AM, but ptx worse on repeat chest film to returned to low wall suction - restarted digoxin - pulled out NGT -------- [**6-4**] -HR mainly in the 70-80s but occasional sympathetic driven spikes to 140-150. continued dig 0.125mg daily and changed PO lopressor to 5mg IV lopressor IV q4hrs -patient desats with any slight movement, for the most part on 6L NC -plan to call family regarding any need for intubation and they will likely say to not intubate at this point, still full code currently though -I/O goal even, by 7 p.m. even -changed CT to water seal, no real change in PTX, per thoracics attg patient will need pleuradesis as he will unlikely improve given stiff lungs related to ILD -MIE stopped -decreased solumedrol to 20mg IV x 1 today, with a plan to continue weaning rapidly -S+S to re-eval [**2120-6-5**] -haldol 0.5mg started tid prn anxiety ------- [**6-6**] - family meeting regarding goals of care - thoracics placed pneumo stat - repeat evening CXR with worsening PTX so placed on suction - 9 pm repeat evening CXR improved - started bactrim for PNA - d/c'ed all nonessential po meds -------------- -re-trial of pneumo-stat failed -chest tube replaced and placed to suction, plan to place to water seal in a.m. prior to discharge home with hospice.

You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a lung biopsy and further evaluation and management.
You had a VATs and pulmonary biopsy procedure.
You are being sent home with a chest tube to "water seal" meaning there is no significant suctioning applied to the space between your lung and chest wall but air cannot enter from the outside.
