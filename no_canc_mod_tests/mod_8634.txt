PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION - VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.6, blood pressure 104/60, heart rate 95, respiratory rate 15, O2 sat 100%.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Mild tenderness on palpation of the right shoulder, although tolerates range of motion of the shoulder.
No tenderness to palpation of either elbow.
RADIOLOGICAL DATA ON ADMISSION:  Trauma x-rays from [**2127-2-28**] show a limited AP view of the chest with apparent widening of the mediastinum that likely reflects patient motion and respiratory effort.
A repeat chest radiograph or CT would be recommended.
Fractures of the superior-inferior left pubic rami are noted.
A CT of the head from [**2127-2-28**] without contrast shows no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect, a small area of hyperdensity seen within the left cerebellar hemisphere on a single slice.
If this is strong clinical correlation, a repeat image in [**2-7**] days would be helpful.
A CT of the C-spine without contrast on [**2127-2-28**] shows no evidence of fracture or subluxation, multiple enlarged lymph nodes within the neck ranging in size from 1.8 x 1.4 cm.
A CT of the torso, chest, abdomen and pelvis on [**2127-2-28**] shows fractures of the left superior-inferior pubic rami which are comminuted, the transverse processes of L1-L3 on the right and the left, sixth to eighth ribs laterally, mediastinal lymphadenopathy that is not specific in etiology and could reflect lymphoma, or other infectious, or inflammatory conditions, cholelithiasis.
Plain film x-rays of the bilateral ankles on [**2127-2-28**] show transverse fractures of the third and fourth proximal left metatarsal bones, oblique fracture of the distal left fibula and the proximal left fibula, comminuted fracture of the distal right fibula, as well as well comminuted fracture of the medial malleolus on the right and the lateral aspect of the distal right tibia with medial displacement of the tibia relative to the right talus.
On [**2127-2-28**], AP wrists and hands, plain film x-rays on the left, show multiple fractures of both hands and wrists as described above.
Plain film x-rays from [**2127-2-28**] of the lumbar and thoracic spine show no evidence of fracture or subluxation.
Plain film x-rays of the bilateral foot on [**2127-11-30**] show no fracture seen on this x-ray.
Plain film x-rays from [**2127-3-1**] of the right shoulder show no fracture or dislocation.
CT on [**2127-3-2**] of the upper extremities without contrast shows the right hand and wrist have comminuted and slightly displaced fractures of the third and fifth metacarpal bones.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 22.1, hemoglobin 12.5, hematocrit 36.0, PT 12.8, PTT 23.6, platelet count 325,000, INR 1.1, fibrinogen 352, blood glucose 102, BUN 18, serum creatinine 1.1, sodium 146, potassium 3.8, chloride 107, bicarb 25, anion gap 18, amylase 31, calcium 8.8, magnesium 1.8, phosphate 2.3.
MICROBIOLOGICAL DATA ON ADMISSION:  Blood cultures from [**2127-3-3**] show no growth.
Urine culture from [**2127-3-11**] shows no growth.
Radiographs and other imaging modalities were instituted, as noted above, with results as noted above.
Cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine films were obtained to clear the patient of any further fractures at these locations.
A lumbar corset was instituted.
Again, all electrolytes were repleted as necessary, and the patient was aggressively rehab screened for rehab placement.
