Initial arterial blood gas on 8 liters nonrebreather was 7.42/34/48.
Chest x-ray showed diffuse pulmonary edema/ARDS.
Cardiology was consulted, and a bedside echocardiogram was performed, and it was reportedly normal.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals:  Temperature 98.3, pulse 96, blood pressure 121/83, 98% on FIO2 100%.
PERTINENT LABORATORIES, X-RAYS, ELECTROCARDIOGRAM, AND OTHER TESTS:  Laboratory data on admission showed a white blood cell count of 14.3 with 88.8% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, hemoglobin 10.7 with MCV of 97, hematocrit 31.4, platelets 254.
Serum electrolytes on admission were a sodium of 134, potassium of 4.1, chloride 97, bicarb 20, BUN 21, creatinine 0.9, glucose 159.
Coagulation profile showed a PT of 12.4, PTT 25.3, INR 1.0.
Urinalysis showed [**1-16**] red blood cells, [**1-16**] white blood cells, moderate bacteria, no yeast, [**4-23**] epithelial cells.
Initial arterial blood gas:  7.4/34/48.
Chest x-ray upon admission showed bilateral air space opacities affecting the mid and lower lung zones.
CT scan of the chest ([**2109-5-6**]):  Demonstrated diffuse alveolar process with ground-glass opacification and scattered areas of more confluent opacification, as well as thickened septal lines, particularly in the right lower lobe.
Electrocardiogram ([**2109-5-6**]):  Sinus tachycardia, rate 117.
Chest x-ray ([**2109-5-7**]):  Interval decrease in the extent of diffuse opacities over lung fields suggestive of improved pulmonary edema.
Blood cultures:  Negative x2.
Urine culture:  Negative with no growth.
Urine Legionella antigen negative.
Urine toxicology screen:  Positive opiates, status post intubation.
After results of her sputum culture returned showing gram-negative rods, she was switched to Levaquin and gentamicin.
By [**2109-5-8**], the patient was in clinically improved via stable oxygenation status and improving chest x-ray.
Her O2 was weaned down as tolerated by her saturation levels.
Additionally, she was continued on Levaquin for the course of her stay in order to cover for an infectious etiology for her diffuse pulmonary edema, although her cultures returned negative.
Hypotension:  On [**2109-5-6**], the patient had an episode of hypotension to blood pressure of 70/40.
Her blood pressure stabilized, and [**2109-5-7**] dopamine was weaned.
As patient had history of overdoses, serum urine and toxicology screens were sent with results as above.
She was instructed to have her hematocrit checked at Dr.[**Name (NI) 105765**] office as her last hemoglobin was 9.
