[**10-27**] CXR - This study is extremely limited by low lung volumes and motion.
A focal opacity of the left mid lung is similar in location to the previous study.
[**10-28**] CXR - There are persistent low lung volumes.
[**10-30**] CXR - As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
The pre-existing parenchymal opacities, the moderate cardiomegaly and the relatively extensive bilateral hilar masses are unchanged in extent and severity.
The lung volumes are still below average.
# Acute Kidney Injury on chronic kidney disease: Admitted with Cr 2.1 up from baseline of 1.2.
# Heart Failure: Day#3 of hospitalization, CXR demonstrated and CXR increased infiltrates and effusions thought to be secondary to CHF.
By Day#4, patient was requiring vented face mask and was laboring to maintain her sats above 90%.
