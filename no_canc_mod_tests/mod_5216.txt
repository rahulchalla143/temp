A workup of these symptoms led to the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy.
He had been stable status post his automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator placement until this month when he was admitted to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital on [**3-21**] after his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fired several times over the course of several days.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**3-23**] for an electrophysiology study which showed multiple fossae of ventricular tachycardia which were not able to be mapped and ablated because he tolerated this study poorly and required cardioversion.
After his electrophysiology study he was transferred to the CMI Service, but had an episode of more than 30 beats of ventricular tachycardia with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator firing; override pacing failed.
Therefore, his sotalol, amiodarone, and mexiletine were discontinued, and the patient was started just on quinidine with good results.
A cardiac transplant evaluation was begun on [**3-31**].
As part of this, a right heart catheterization was performed on [**4-2**] with the following numbers:  A right atrial pressure mean of 23, right ventricle of 49/23, pulmonary artery 49/33, wedge of 33, cardiac output of 3.2, cardiac index of 1.3, pulmonary vascular resistance of 200, less than 3 Wood units, systemic vascular resistance of 1625, superior vena cava saturation of 54, pulmonary artery saturation of 50.
An echocardiogram on the same day showed an ejection fraction of less than 15%, moderate dilation of the left atrium, biventricular dilation, and severe biventricular hypokinesis.
Because of the results of his right heart catheterization, he was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for Swan-[**Location (un) **] therapy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 96, heart rate of 85, blood pressure of 110/60, respiratory rate of 16, 97% on room air.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed white blood cell count of 7.8, hematocrit of 43.6, platelets of 155.
Sodium of 143, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 101, bicarbonate of 30, blood urea nitrogen of 16, creatinine of 1.2, glucose of 65.
A milrinone drip was started with subsequent increase in cardiac output and a decrease in his pulmonary artery and wedge pressures.
A Psychiatry consultation was obtained who recommended adding Ativan as well as continuation of Celexa.
CARDIAC TRANSPLANT EVALUATION:  The patient had serologies and 24-hour urine collection, appropriate radiologic studies, and cardiac catheterization performed during this hospitalization in an anticipation of cardiac transplant.
NOTE:  The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, as well as discharge medications, and plans for discharge, followup, and transplant evaluation will be dictated in a Discharge Summary Addendum.
