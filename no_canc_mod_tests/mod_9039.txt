Mrs.[**Hospital 46766**] medical history goes back to [**2170**], when She was evaluated by a CT scan at that time and was told that she had several mini-strokes in addition to a large stroke that was responsible for her left-sided weakness.
She also had an angiogram which showed that the right internal carotid artery was occluded completely with a high grade stenosis on the left side.
A magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed several left-sided centrum semiovale strokes consistent with watershed strokes.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has been transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further stroke workup and evaluation for carotid endarterectomy and possible angiogram.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission, the patient had a temperature of 97.6, blood pressure 170/90, heart rate 76, respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 96% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact.
Pulmonary:  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 7.3, hematocrit 41, platelet count 292,000, sodium 137, potassium 3.5, chloride 99, bicarbonate 28, BUN 9, creatinine 0.7, glucose 71.
Cholesterol is 198, triglycerides 186, HDL 58, LDL 103.
Head magnetic resonance imaging scan from [**2171**]-97 showed old right-sided macrovascular infarctions in the centrum semiovale; [**2177**] showed left-sided MCA/ACA watershed infarctions.
She had a carotid angiogram on [**2178-11-17**] that showed critical stenosis of the left internal carotid artery which is complex and described as long and unable to be intervened upon by carotid endarterectomy.
She had an ultrasound of her groin as well as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.
She was transfused with two units of packed red blood cells and hematocrit bumped appropriately.
The patient's blood pressure decreased from the 170s to 180s to the 120s to 130s after her carotid stenting.
She will also follow up with her primary care physician for further evaluation of her anemia.
She has had several iron studies and hemolysis labs sent during this hospitalization; the hemolysis labs are negative for hemolytic anemia.
Workup for iron deficiency is still pending.
