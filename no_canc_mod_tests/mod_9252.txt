In clinic, he was hypotensive to 80/50, (baseline BP is 90-100 with EF of 30%), tachycardic at 110, with a temp of 99 and a productive cough.
His CXR was clear and EKG was unremarkable.
He as given several boluses for a total of 3 liters and blood pressure continued to be in the 70s systolics.
His UOP was 800 cc overnight and mental status was stable.
Overnight, he received 3L IVF and SBP remained 80s-100s.
MRI demonstrated pan spinal cord inflammation and he was felt to possibly have a myelitis of inflammatory etiology vs AVM; CT myelogram, CTA for AVM, and spinal cord biopsy were beign considered.
At midnight, his BP dropped from his recently bl of 90s-100s to 70/58; at 4AM it was 74/52, at 8AM 78/52 and 93/67 @ 1600.
His creatinine rose from .5 on [**2-24**] to 1.3 to 2 today.
On arrival to floor, I gave the patient a 500cc bolus which rose his pressure to 100/60.

ECG Study Date of [**2105-2-17**]  1:30:52 PM Resting sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2104-11-26**], allowing for lead placement variation, no diagnostic change.

However, if there is a concern for metastatic disease or risk factor for primary lung cancer, then a followup CT in [**2105-10-10**] may be helpful to ensure stability.
ECHO Study Date of [**2105-2-27**] 1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-11-4**], no significant change.
Sepsis also possible given pseudomonas UTI during previous admission, although no leukocytosis, normal differential, afebrile since admission; alternative source included decub sacral ulcer which grew MRSA.
Lactate of 1.7 made sepsis less likely and he had been afebrile since completing 10 day course of vanc/zosyn for ?
Urine negative for eosinophils.
Urine lytes consistent with intrinsic failure.
Renal ultrasound revealed increased echogenicity of both kidneys, possibly due to acute renal parenchymal disease from AIN and WBC's in urine sediment.
Repeat CXR [**2-18**] negative for infiltrates.
Oxygen saturations stable on RA.
Serial CXR's have been very clear with no evidence of infiltrate or edema.
Lung exam, however, noted to be markedly worsened on [**3-2**] but again no evidence of infiltrate on CXR.
CT chest scan revealed Septal thickening at the lung bases and small right pleural effusion, consistent with hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
INR therapeutic on coumadin increased, likely from receiving ciprofloxacin on admission.
MRI concerning for demyelinating disease.
Repeat MRI during current hospital course revealed expanding inflammatory cord disease of unknown etiology (?
RPR negative, lyme negative, ESR 70/CRP 66.8, [**Doctor First Name **] negative.
Further work-up such as biopsy, spinal CTA deferred at this time due to above acute issues.
Neurology will followup with further workup outpatient.
Wound swab culture grew MRSA.
# Dispo: Followup with PCP for further medical management, [**Hospital1 18**] Plastic Surgery, and [**Hospital1 18**] Neurology.
Followup Instructions: Please have INR level checked regularly to ensure its within therapeutic range.
