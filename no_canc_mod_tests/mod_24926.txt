If indicated an MRI could be performed  [**2108-9-27**]:  cat scan of head:   IMPRESSION: Mild parenchymal atrophy and chronic small vessel disease but no acute intracranial findings  [**2108-9-27**]:  chest x-ray:  IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly but no acute cardiopulmonary process  [**2108-9-27**]: Pelvis and hip x-ray:  AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS, TWO VIEWS OF THE LEFT FEMUR: There are mildly displaced right superior and inferior pubic rami fractures.
Since the previous tracing of [**2108-9-28**] ventricular rate is slower and ST-T wave abnormalities have decreased.
TRACING #4  [**2108-10-1**]:  chest x-ray:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including tortuous aorta and mild cardiomegaly.
The anterior mediastinal mass is best visualized on the CT of [**2108-9-27**] and is not well seen on the lateral radiograph due to rotation.
The cat scan of the torso was suggestive of active hemorrhage or pseudo-aneurysm from internal pudental artery.
For this reason, he had serial hematocrits drawn and was taken to angiography for coil embolization of the left internal iliac.
Post-procedure, he was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit with serial hematocrits.
He did require transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells.
His vital signs are stable.
