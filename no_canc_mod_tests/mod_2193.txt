[**2129-6-8**] CXR Portable AP IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with patchy basilar opacities, greater on the left than right, probably attributable to atelectasis, but not entirely specific.
BP normal upon presentation to ICU (last admission BP normalized to approx 100-110 systolic).
The patients blood pressure remained stable and he remained afebrile and was transferred to the general medical service.
Thereafter, BP were normal with the exception of one event during hemodialysis; this episode of hypotension was attributed to not taking midodrine prior to hemodialysis as the patient normally does.
The patient declined further labs and ECHO and requested discharge to home.
As above blood pressure stabilized and he was dialyzed on HD 1 and 3.
A cardiac evaluation for heart failure was attempted; troponin 0.05 but the patient declined further cardiac biomarkers and ECHO.
