Relevant studies: [**2197-2-12**] Echo - Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis c/w pulmonary embolism.
[**2197-2-13**] Echo - Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-2-12**], right ventricular cavity size is smaller and free wall motion is more vigorous.
[**2197-2-12**] ECG - Sinus rhythm.
[**2197-2-12**] CT Chest - 1.
[**2197-2-13**] CXR - Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to chest CT from [**2197-2-12**].
LENIs were negative for DVT.
Echo showed evidence of right heart strain and RV hypokinesis.
She had a [**4-14**] point hematocrit drop, that intially remained stable but on [**2-24**], her hematocrit droppeed from 29 to 25.
Upper extremity ultrasound showed DVT in the distal left brachial veins.
CT angiogram of the thigh showed no active extravasation of blood.
Her hct was stable over these 3 days, so on [**2197-2-27**] she was started on a heparin drip, intially with low goal PTT of 50-70, her hct was stable, and goal was increased to 80.
Her INRS: [**3-3**] 7am: 1.8 [**3-4**] 6am: 2.2 [**3-4**] 12pm: 2.6 She recieved 1 lovenox injection prior to leaving the hospital in order to completw 24 hour of overlap between therapeutic PT with heparin/lovenox.
Given her bleeding earlier in the hospital course, her goal INR is 2-2.5, and she was instructed to return to the hospital with any bleeding, lightheadedness, new hematoma formation.
Torso CT at [**Hospital1 18**] confirmed LUL PNA.
Blood and sputum cultures were negative.
She also had a repeat chest xray and blood cultures and urinalysis sent.
All cultures were negative, and the fever was thought to be from the hematoma.
She was on a CIWA scale with lorazepam and did not demonstrate any signs of withdrawal.
Her head CT was negative.
On [**2197-2-25**] she showed signs of narcotic withdrawal-- crampy abdominal pain, tremor, diarrhea, nausea; so was started on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] scale, given 10mg PO oxycodone for [**Doctor Last Name **] >10.
Her pressures remained stable throughout admission.
Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2197-2-12**] until [**2197-2-20**] for evaluation and treatment of your pulmonary embolism.
