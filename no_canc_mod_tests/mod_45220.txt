However, the patient's liver function tests increased back into the 400 and 500's and the patient's pancreatic enzymes started increasing again.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained on [**1-30**] to rule out any evidence of cholecystitis.
The patient was drawn with more blood cultures and urine cultures and they remained negative.
On [**2-1**], given the patient's lack of neurological improvement and decline after stopping the anti-seizure medications, this was discussed with Neurology and it was felt that the patient would benefit from an EEG and initiation of a new anti-seizure medication.
The patient was started on Keppra, 500 mg twice a day, and Ativan 0.5 mg twice a day and an EEG was performed the day after these medications were initiated.
The patient's EEG did not show any evidence of seizure activity but it was felt that this was less conclusive given the fact that she has been recently medicated as well as it was just a snapshot of her neurological status.
Since then, the patient has been afebrile with temperatures in the range of 97.0 F. to 98.0 F.  The patient's liver function tests subsequently began decreasing and at the time of this dictation, the patient's AST is in the 200's and ALT is in the 100's.
The patient's tube feeds were held on [**2-1**], and the patient's pancreatic enzymes were followed and decreased to less than 100.
The patient continues to improve from a Neurological standpoint and a Speech and Swallow study is pending.
Of note, the patient finished her course of levofloxacin for her Legionella and since her defervescence after the Dilantin was stopped the patient has not exhibited any signs of infection.
It was felt that the fevers were of unknown origin and her CBC and liver function tests were likely secondary to the Dilantin therapy.
