The BP normalized in ED with one liter of IVF, which was reassuring.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent with consideration of his prior infections (hx of ESBL e.coli, VRE, multiple episodes of sepsis).
CXR did not show signs of pneumonia.
Blood pressure remained above 110 throughout the admission.
Pyuria was present on UA and likely reflects ESRD on HD.
Bedside U/s in the ED demonstrated a large aortic aneurysm, which appears stable on CT scan, and unlikely to be cause of hypotension.
Cultures need to be followed up as an outpatient.
A TTE was performed to assess for cardiogenic cause of hypotension.
His dry weight in HD was increased in an effort to prevent further peri-HD hypotension.
There were no EKG changes from a recent comparison.
In the emergency room your blood pressure was found to be 82/49.
You received 1 Liter of fluid intravenously and your blood pressure rose to 112/58.
Blood and urine cultures were sent to the lab that need to be followed up.
Imaging of your stomach revealed that your abdominal aortic aneurism is stable.
While in the hospital you were sent to the intensive care unit for further monitoring and then transferred to the medicine service.
Throughout your stay your blood pressure has remained stable.
