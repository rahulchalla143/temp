Further evaluation is necessary with pelvic ultrasound to exclude an ovarian malignancy  [**5-22**] KUB: Pneumoperitoneum  [**5-23**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
[**5-26**] UGI: No evidence of extravasation of contrast on this study which visualizes through to the second portion of the duodenum  [**5-26**] KUB: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
[**5-28**] CT Abd/Pelvis: Large pelvic abscess adjacent to the distal sigmoid colon.
Severe atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and its main abdominal branches  [**5-29**] CT Guided Drainage-Approximately 20 cc of bloody pus-like fluid was aspirated and sent to the lab for Gram stain and culture.
[**5-31**] CT A/P: Catheter within the pelvic abscess, which is smaller than on the prior study.
Opacity in the left base not seen on the prior studies is likely inflammatory in nature.
Contrast material and gas tracking from the sigmoid colon to the inferior aspect of this collection suggests continued connection with the sigmoid colon to some portions of this collection.
Correlation with catheter output is recommended to decide management of this drainage catheter.
Peripheral Imaging was performed of the abdominal aorta and the iliac vessels.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient admitted to surgical service on [**2158-5-22**] following PE findings of distended mildly tender abdomen that demonstrated rebound but no guarding and radiological studies showing findings of free air.
She was initially transferred to the SICU for serial abdominal exams and conservative management based on her multiple comorbidities.
Patient monitored for new-onset afib, which converted to SR following volume resuscitation.
Patient ruled in on cardiac enzymes for MI.
Patient maintained stable blood pressure throughout remainder of ICU and surgical floor stay.
Because of initial NSTEMI, patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**6-8**] after having been started on plavix.
RESP: Patient maintained stable oxygen saturations throughout hospitalization, and had albuterol nebs/inhalers available on PRN basis.
Patient had serial abdominal exams performed throughout HD1-HD2.
Patient had UGI performed on HD5 which showed no duodenal ulcer and normal gastric filling/emptying without extravasation through second part of duodenum.
Patient had repeat CT abdomen on HD7 which demonstrated a possible abscess that had previously been read as a right ovarian cyst.
Patient had collection tapped on HD8 by CT guidance with removal of frank pus that grew vanc sensitive/amp resistant enterococcus.
Patient was started on TPN on HD8 with gradual transition to lipid containing TPN on HD10.
