Reportedly his blood pressure which usually was systolic of 160 to 200 dropped to 130 and he had worsening symptoms of right hemiplegia and also in terms of left sided symptoms.
For this reason, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On readmission on [**2109-1-11**], systolic blood pressure is in the 170s and diastolic blood pressure is in the 80s.
Heart rate is in the 60s and regular.
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurological examination on readmission revealed the patient is dysarthric and somnolent but fairly arousible, can say his name but does not know the date (question inattentive/frustrated) or what hospital.
The rest of the examination was not completed due to the patient's disinterest.
Motor examination - flaccid right side, only moves toes to noxious stimuli, question spasms, right side has significantly more strength.
Notably deltoids 5-/5, biceps [**6-9**], and distal upper extremities have 5-/5 finger extensors and [**6-9**] finger flexors.
Quadriceps was [**6-9**], hamstring was 5-/5 and the remainder of all the muscle groups were essentially full strength either [**6-9**] or 5-/5.
Sensory - The patient denies any decrease in sensation to light touch and cold touch, question of inattention.
Neurologic - A magnetic resonance scan was done with stroke protocol that showed extension of restricted diffusion in the left parapontine region with new restricted diffusion in the left cerebellum and a minimal restricted diffusion on the right.
At least one time we did a repeat imaging because we were concerned that he may have had further extension of infarct but we did not find any new findings beside what has already been mentioned above.
After an episode of pulmonary edema on the morning of [**2109-2-5**], after administration of fresh frozen plasma to reverse supratherapeutic INR that will be described below in the cardiovascular section, an angiogram was done by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37461**] to determine possibility of angioplasty of posterior circulation, however, on this angiogram, there was evidence of total occlusion of the basilar artery with evidence of collaterals being formed from the PICA and possible collateral blood flow from the left meningeal vasculature.
Also from a neurological standpoint, we have kept his blood pressure always more than 160 systolic but we have revisited this issue as discussed below in the next section.
However, on [**2109-2-5**], he was found to be diaphoretic, tachypneic with rate of 40s and stat electrocardiogram was done that showed evidence of ST wave elevation and reciprocal depression in the precordial leads and with evidence of T wave inversion in the lateral leads.
A stat cardiology consultation was called and this was felt to be flash pulmonary edema due to the fact that he had recently been transfused with one unit of fresh frozen plasma for an supratherapeutic INR of 5.2.
Lopressor 12.5 mg from time to time to control his blood pressure.
The patient had another congestive heart failure exacerbation with flash pulmonary edema on chest x-ray on the morning of [**2109-2-17**].
He was again found to be diaphoretic with tachypnea in the 40s and systolic blood pressure 220/110.
However, if we did not control his blood pressure adequately, a decision has been reached that we will tightly control his blood pressure between 150 and 160.
His contact numbers are home [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37463**] and his beeper [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37464**].
Please note that hematocrit has been stable in the low 30s ranging between 30.0 and 32.0.
Lasix 20 mg q.o.d., hold for systolic blood pressure less than 150.
Nitroglycerin patch 0.2 mg between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., take off for systolic blood pressure less than 150.
