She had persantine MIBI on [**2108-10-18**] which showed possible mild lateral wall ischemia.
Following cath started on heparin gtt (since continued mild CP and ST depressions/TWI in lateral leads).
Sister with MI at 32 and CABG at 34; other sister with MI at 48 and cardiac arrest; other sister with hypertension and died at 59 during stress test.
Physical Exam: VS - T 98.6; BP 99/63(range 99-133); P 82(range 66-82); R22; 95-97%RA Gen: WDWN middle aged female in NAD.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: Initial EKG ([**11-12**] AM) demonstrated NSR at 97, normal axis/intervals, ST depressions V4-V6, I; TWI aVL.
ECG [**11-13**] AM (during CP) also with NSR at 76, lateral ST depressions and TWI (V5, V6, I, aVL).
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
ETT performed on [**2108-10-18**] demonstrated: + chest and jaw pain with hypertension to 210/120; imaging showing ?mild lateral wall ischemia vs. artifact.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2108-11-12**] demonstrated: 99% mid LCx lesion (failed attempt to stent), 100% OM1 and 90% OM2; 50% mid LAD and 80% D1 (also aneurysmal); 60% mid RCA.
