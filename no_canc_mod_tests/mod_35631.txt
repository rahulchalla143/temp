Physical Exam: VS: BP 153/68 P76 RR18 93%RA (baseline per patient) GENERAL: Not in NAD.
PULSES: Right: Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: Cardiac catheterization [**2172-7-29**]: 1.
Coronary angiography in this left dominant system revealed three vessel disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of 151 mmHg.
ECHO [**2172-7-30**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Carotid US [**2172-7-30**]: Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
