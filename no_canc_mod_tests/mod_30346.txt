WBC 3.1 and hypotension could, however, suggest sepsis.
Given a 70kg female with about 31.5L total body water where Q=mC(deltaT) and  room temperature saline being 23C, (excluding the heat content of other tissues which is not significant) one would expect the temperature of her TBW to be 34.16C, which is 93.48F, following adminisration of 8L saline.
Her TSH and morning cortisol were within normal limits.
The patient's blood pressure responded well to the dexamethasone.
Random cortisol was within normal limits, however.
No evidence of acute liver failure as INR and bilirubin normal.
She agreed to get repeat LFTs done in 48 hrs with her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/or neurologist.
