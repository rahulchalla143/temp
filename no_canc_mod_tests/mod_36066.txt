RENAL ULTRASOUND: IMPRESSION: Unchanged overall appearance of renal transplant with marked upper pole cortical thinning and underlying focal hydronephrosis.
Doppler examination demonstrates relatively normal venous flow and preserved systolic and diastolic arterial flow, though the latter is low in amplitude, as before.
However, though the Doppler evaluation of the upper pole parenchyma is limited, the elevated RIs, which appear new, in the setting of rising creatinine, raise the possibility of chronic rejection.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 77 y/o Female with HTN, DM2, CAD S/P CABG, Afib, ESRD S/P Renal Transplant, and RAS S/P Angioplasty with rising creatinine and elevated blood pressure, but asymptomatic.
Urine studies were consistent with an intrinsic cause of renal failure and patient had nephrotic range proteinuria.
Serum protein and urine protein had been negative in [**Month (only) **].
Prograf levels were followed and were within therapeutic range, making renal failure secondary to prograf unlikely.
Hypertension: Blood pressure was elevated while in hospital and patient's medications were changed to correct this.
CXR unread but appears to have stable chronic R sided effusion.
Diastolic Dysfunction: Pt was continued on antihypertensives with good effect.
PTH level was checked and remained elevated.
Calcium levels were within normal.
HCT was stable with no evidence of bleeding.
