His post-op course was complicated by developement of hypotension and a STEMI which is being treated medically.

TTE [**2107-10-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
TTE [**2107-10-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.

[**Hospital1 18**] WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2107-10-28**]): BETA STREPTOCOCCUS GROUP A.
- OSH Blood Cultures- [**2107-10-23**] - Group G Beta Strep - 4/4 bottles  - OSH Wound Cultures- [**2107-10-23**] - Wound cultures - Abundant growth Group G Beta Strep .
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normotensive systemic arterial pressure of 92/55 mmHg.
Wound cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] grew Group A strep however blood and wound cultures from OSH grew group G strep.
Subsequent 12 lead ECG showed inferior/posterior/lateral ST elevations.
Troponin peaked at 3.15 and CK-MB peaked at 149.
However, cardiac cath performed 6 days later showed only moderate three vessel coronary artery disease without obvious culprit lesion in LCX or RCA to explain inferolateral STEMI.
The echo findings were not consistent with a stress induced cardiomyopathy.
Cardiac cath was not performed at the time of diagnosis because of his active infection and septic physiology.
Lysis was not an option given his recent surgical debridement.
After he was stabilized he was transferred to the cardiology service and underwent cardiac cath which showed the findings described above.
A repeat EGD may be performed at that time as well because visibility was limited by active bleeding during inpatient EGD.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine was 2.3 on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], most likely pre-renal from septic shock.
Creatinine subsequently improved to 1.0.
His baseline creatinine is unknown.
