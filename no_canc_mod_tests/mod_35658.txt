Urine osmolalities were 377.
FeNa was 0.4%.
Pleural fluid #1 revealed 12,750 white blood cells, neutrophils of 70, lymphocytes of 6, monocytes of 20, red blood cells of 20,750, pH was 7.7, total protein was 2.2, lactate dehydrogenase was 71, glucose was 108, albumin was 1.

Pleural fluid #2 revealed 625 white blood cells, 7% polys, 13% monocytes, red blood cells of 37,250, total protein was 2.4, lactate dehydrogenase was 110, glucose was 110, albumin was 1.
Gram stain revealed 2+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
Cultures negative for growth.
A chest x-ray on [**5-31**] revealed apical left pneumothorax, right opacification of hemithorax, a small pleural effusion (decreased from [**2133-5-29**] study).
A renal ultrasound revealed both kidneys were swollen and echogenic in appearance; in keep with the patient's stated history of acute renal failure.
A computed tomography angiogram on [**5-29**] showed no pulmonary embolism.
SIGNIFICANT HOSPITAL STUDIES:  (During the patient's stay, the patient had numerous radiologic studies performed)  1.
A computed tomography angiogram of the chest with and without contrast and reconstruction with findings which demonstrated an interval development of left-sided pleural effusion and patchy opacities in the left lung.
Multiple chest x-rays repeatedly showing a left-sided pleural effusion with opacification of the right chest wall.
A renal ultrasound showed swollen echogenic kidneys; in keeping with a history of possible acute renal failure.
A magnetic resonance imaging of the chest and mediastinum with and without contrast following was recent ultrasound examination demonstrated thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein, occlusion versus narrowing of the left brachiocephalic vein, consolidation of the left upper lobe and lingula, multiple cavitations in the right upper lobe, and a large left pleural effusion.
Bilateral lower extremity Doppler studies showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
Magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen, pelvis, and kidneys showed no evidence of tumor within the abdomen, pelvis, or kidneys.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was obtained to evaluate for pericardial constriction showed a normal left ventricular cavity size, with normal regional and global ventricular systolic function, normal right ventricular cavity size.
The patient refused two additional studies that were requested; a renal biopsy and cystoscopy.
The patient had a bronchoscopy on [**6-5**] which was highly suggestive of atypical cells; consistent with adenocarcinoma of the lung.
However, no biopsy was performed as no mass was identified.
A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a large pleural effusion; however, there was no constriction (based on the Cardiology interpretation).
The patient also had multiple chest magnetic resonance imaging studies and computed tomographies which demonstrated no obvious cause for the recurrent pleural effusions; however, a further study will be complained on [**6-24**] when the patient undergoes a positron emission tomography of the chest.
A pleurodesis was determined to be a risky procedure in a patient with limited pulmonary reserve and only one functioning lung.
A magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen and pelvis showed that there was no deep venous thrombosis or renal vein thrombosis.
However, the patient refused an inpatient renal biopsy which hindered a confirmatory pathological diagnosis.
However, by discharge his urine protein to creatinine ratio had increased back to 5, and he remained moderately hypertensive in the 140s with proteinuria and hematuria in his urine.
The patient also refused a cystoscopy while in house to evaluate the bladder (per a Urology consultation).
Hematocrit levels typically ran in the mid 20s to high 20s.
However, near the end of his hospital course his hematocrit started trending downward.
He ultimately had a hematocrit of 23.
Two units were transfused, and his hematocrit jumped to 26 and was transfused elevating his hematocrit to above 28.
On discharge, his hematocrit was 30.7.
There was marked discrepancy in the notes in terms of blood pressure recordings.
The patient often had recorded blood pressures in his thigh which were often 30 to 40 points above his left arm level.
The patient had a peripherally inserted central catheter line in his right arm which prevented blood pressure measurements.
However, in the left arm his blood pressures were consistently in the 120s to 140s, and was 135/80 on discharge.
