On admission, she was found to have an O2 sat of 85% on RA, and was given nebs/IV lasix.
Her initial ABG was 7.12/47/152/16 with lactate of 8, and CPAP was initially begun in the ED.
She was noted to be bradycardic, with a ?junctional escape rhythm at a rate of 48 bpm in the setting of hyperkalemia (K=7), and was given atropine.
Her renal function improved, with Cr 1.4 the morning of [**Hospital 12145**] transfer to the floor (baseline 0.8 - 1.2).
She also was noted to be febrile, and was treated empirically for possible MRSA pneumonia (sputum cultures positive for MRSA), with defervescence on [**1-17**].
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Vital Signs: Temp 98.4, BP 130/60, HR 84, RR 20, SaO2 94% RA, last 4 fs in reverse order: 84, 62, 174, 98.

Consequently, blood pressure normalized and patient was easily weaned off pressors on hospital day one.
* BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA: Given above difficulty with extubation and intermittent fevers, sputum gram stain and cultures were sent, and patient was found to have MRSA pneumonia.
Prior to microbiological data, patient was empirically started on levofloxacin and metronidazole, but vancomycin was added following identification of Staphylococcus aureus in sputum culture [**1-17**].
Nonetheless, patient continued to require 1:1 precautions - which outpatient psychiatrist felt would be expected at patient's baseline mental status.
* ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  On admission, patient's creatinine was 2.7, thought to be secondary to hypoperfusion during bradycardic episode.
She will need monitoring of potassium to ensure that hyperkalemia does not recurr on this medication.
