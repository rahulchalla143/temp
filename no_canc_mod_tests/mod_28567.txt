Apgars were 7 and 7.
Length 19 inches or 48.5 cm which is 50th to 75th percentile.
Head circumference is 34 cm which is 75th to 90th percentile.
Chest x-ray was done initially which was consistent with transient tachypnea of the newborn.
An ABG was done on admission with oxygen at 100% to rule out any cardiac anomalies.
The pH was 7.35, C02 of 38 and P02 of 192.
The chest x-ray at that time had worsened to atelectasis and surfactant deficiency.
The infant has been on room air since that time, with a normal respiratory rate, no increased work of breathing and oxygen saturations in the  range.
The blood pressure remained stable.
Screening cardiac investigations including hyperoxia test, EKG, chest radiograph and 4-extremity blood pressure were negative and cardiology consultation suggested that this was likely a benign finding.
Follow-up consultation and echo are scheduled for one week following discharge.

Infectious disease: CBC and blood culture were done on admission to the NICU to rule out sepsis.
