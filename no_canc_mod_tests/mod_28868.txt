The decreased hematocrit prompted a CT abdomen and pelvis to be obtained which demonstrated active bleeding from the anterior liver causing a large hematoma in the right upper quadrant with extension of the hematoma into the pelvis.
Urgent angiogram was performed of the liver demonstrating superselective angiogram of the hepatic arteries demonstrating an area of acute extravasation in the anterior segment of the right lobe of the liver.

On [**2122-3-9**], the patient had an ERCP demonstrating the previous stent placed in the biliary duct was found in the major papilla.
The forceful injection was performed and the patient was rotated for optimal visualization, appeared we were in fact viewing both a nondilated right and a moderately dilated left system.
On [**2122-3-10**], the patient continued to be afebrile, vital signs stable with WBC of 8.8, hematocrit of 31.0, platelets 322,000.
Sodium 134, potassium 4.3, chloride 102, bicarbonate 24, BUN 15, creatinine 0.6, and glucose of 95.
AST was 132, ALT 279, alkaline phosphatase 492, total bilirubin 1.9 which had decreased significantly.
Amylase and lipase 221 and 137 which was also decreased.

Sodium 133, potassium 3.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate 26, BUN 11 and creatinine 0.5, glucose 121.
AST was 110, ALT 199, alkaline phosphatase 242, total bilirubin 1.3.
Temperature was worked up which included a UA, UC, blood cultures which were all unremarkable.
The patient was transfused blood for a hematocrit of 24.1.
Fingersticks were within range of 105 to 139.
There is dilation of the left hepatic duct as noted, unchanged compared to the ERCP on [**2122-3-9**].
On [**2122-3-26**], CT abdomen and pelvis was performed because of persistent nausea and vomiting which demonstrated no evidence of bowel obstruction or other acute gastrointestinal pathology.
After receiving the CAT scan and speaking with the patient, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that all unnecessary medications should be stopped which included antibiotic Keflex, which she had been treated with 1 day of Keflex.
She was afebrile and vital signs were stable.
