Electrocardiograms at the outside hospital reportedly with ST depressions in leads II, III, aVF, and V4 to V6.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**3-9**] for cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization on [**3-9**] showed multivessel disease including an 80% left main stenosis, tight stenosis at the first diagonal with competitive flow, large ramus, but no significant disease in the left circumflex, and 70% mid right coronary artery, and 70% posterior descending artery origin stenosis.
The patient was evaluated by Cardiothoracic Surgery but refused coronary artery bypass graft, and instead opted for a repeat cardiac catheterization with stent placement.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Her blood pressure was 108/57, her heart rate was 90, her respiratory rate was 18, and her oxygen saturation was 96% to 100% on room air.
Physical examination was notable for a small excoriation in the upper drip with dried blood.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, left anterior fascicular block, old T wave inversion in aVL, and less than 1-mm ST depressions in V5 and V6.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Her white blood cell count was 5.4, her hematocrit was 26.5 (without previous baseline available), her mean cell volume was 92, and her platelets were 247.
Her INR was 1.1.
Chemistries were notable for a sodium of 128, blood urea nitrogen of 24, and creatinine was 0.8.
Liver enzymes and bilirubin were normal.
Her albumin was 3.2.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for catheterization which showed multivessel disease as outlined above.
The patient underwent catheterization (as mentioned above) which she tolerated well without known complications.
A formal echocardiogram was performed on [**3-10**] which showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50%, probable anterior wall hypokinesis, and 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation; but was otherwise normal.
The patient's blood pressure tolerated the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor well and remained in the 100 to 130 range throughout her hospital stay.
The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on [**3-11**] which showed gastritis of the stomach without any visible ulcerations.
The patient received two units of packed red blood cells on her first day of admission at [**Hospital1 188**] for her hematocrit of 26.5.
Her hematocrit increased appropriately and was stable in the low to mid 30s throughout the remainder of her hospital stay.
Her hematocrit was checked serially due to the possible gastrointestinal bleed.
Coronary artery disease; status post catheterization times two with stent placement.
