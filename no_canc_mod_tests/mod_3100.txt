Upon EMS arrival, she was found to be hypertensive to 200/40 and bradycardic.
She was intubated for resp distress in the field and was given atropine for HR in 30s (unclear if for hypotension).
She was found to be in a new junctional rythm on EKG in 30's 40's.
A CXR revealed interstitial edema.
Notably systolic pressures were in the 130's during her last hospital admission, presumably the reason why her HCTZ and enalapril doses were halved.
Patient is poorly compliant and most recently has not been taking her antihypertensives due to her ill son-in-law, unable to pick up her meds from the pharmacy.

Further evaluation with PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended when the patient's condition allows.
Compared to tracing #2 atrial fibrillation and ventricular premature beat are new.
Her presentation was not consistent with ARDS and her initial ABG on the ventilator shows mild compensated hypercapnea without hypoxia.
Her nodal agents were held, and she was treated with a nitro gtt for her HTN, as well as nebs and stress dose steroids, and she was extubated later on the first day of her hospital course.
Blood pressure medications, including clonidine, enalapril, and nifedipine were titrated.
