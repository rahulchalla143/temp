A head computed tomography showed a basilar skull fracture and a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On admission, the patient's temperature was 99.6 degrees Fahrenheit and his blood pressure was 145/palp.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 33.6, his hematocrit was 41.9, and his platelets were 377.
The patient's Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 142, potassium was 3.7, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was 11, creatinine was 0.1, and his blood glucose was 136.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax.
A head computed tomography revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage and left frontotemporal contusion, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and multiple basal skull fractures.
A computed tomography angiogram of the head and neck revealed no evidence of neurovascular injury.
The patient had blossoming of contusions on repeat computed tomography scan 24 hours after his admission.
A head computed tomography showed further blossoming of contusions, and a ventricular drain was placed on [**2139-12-14**].
On [**12-15**], the patient's intracranial pressure continued to climb and his hydrocephalus was worse despite ventricular drain placement.
He had a diagnostic angio to rule out vascular malformation which was ruled out.
We continued to be monitored with a ventricular drain in place leveled at 10 cm above the tragus.
Levofloxacin was added for gram-negative blood cultures that were positive from [**12-18**] and gram-negative rods in his sputum.
The cerebrospinal fluid remained negative (culture wise).
Postoperatively, his vital signs were stable.
He had Enterobacter grow out from his blood cultures from [**12-18**] and Staphylococcus aureus from his sputum from [**12-18**].
On [**12-29**], the ventricular drain was raised to 18 cm above the tragus.
On [**1-1**], the patient spiked a temperature to 102.1 degrees Fahrenheit and was fully cultured.
Urine cultures were pending.
Blood cultures were pending.
The patient's ventricular drain was clamped at this point (on [**2140-1-3**]).
The ventricular drain was discontinued on [**2140-1-13**] along with the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain that was in place.
His vital signs have been stable.
Artificial Tears 1 to 2 drops both eyes as needed.
Metoprolol 50 mg by mouth three times per day (hold for a heart rate of less than 60 or blood pressure less than 100).
