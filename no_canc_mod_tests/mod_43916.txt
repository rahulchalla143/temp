Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-1-18**], the left ventricular cavity is slightly smaller and the estimated PA systolic pressure is lower.
CXR: CT A/P: IMPRESSION: 1.
Increase in bilateral pleural effusions since CT of [**1-17**], with increased bilateral consolidation and atelectasis.
Confirmation of resolution after treatment is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo male with CAD s/p CABG, CHF EF 20%, HTN, DM2, h/o UTI, h/o CoNS bacteremia, antibody positive-HIT, s/p trach/peg ([**5-3**]) who presented as a transfer from [**Hospital 8**] hospital with septic and cardiogenic shock.
Other blood cx, urine cxa nd C diff negative.
Repeat TTE with EF 25%.
BP normal over >72 hours off pressors with diuresis.
Mechanical [**Hospital 1291**]: Patient on warfarin with INR goal 2.5-3.5.
HIT so bridged with argatroban with therapeutic INR on [**6-17**].
INR will need to be closely monitoried and he may need increased coumadin dose since now will be off cipro and will have lowering of INR once discontinued.
Coumadin dose stable at 5mg daily, decreased to 2 mg daily and was on hold the day of discharge given uptrending INR (while on 2.5mg daily), which was 4.7 at discharge.
Will need close monitoring since medications being adjusted and will be off cipro.
VAP: Psuedomonas on sputum cx associated with leukocytosis and sepsis with infiltrate so treated for 15 day course ciprofloxacin, last day [**6-18**].
A bronchoscopy was performed which was unremarkable, and event was felt to be due to a mucous plug.
# CHF; EF 20% with evidence of volume overload on CXR.
His weight on discharge is 104 kg, down from 119 kg on admission.
He reponds to Lasix 60-80 mg IV, but was held for Na 150 and Cr up to 1.3 on discharge.
We advise continuing torsemide 40mg 1-2 times diaily for goal even I/Os, until Na worsens or cr increases above 1.2.
Would restart captopril if BP allows.
Patient will need CT follow up as below.
# R sided mass vs effusion: Had pleural based infiltrate on CXR post-[**Female First Name (un) 576**] so CT obtained which was more consistent with effusion and likely atelectasis and lung collapse.
Should have imaging to eval for recurrent effusion based on symptomatology and a repeat CT chest in [**12-26**] months to evaluate for interval change to follow a lung nodule and rule out enlarging mass.
CT A/P with PO contrast obtaiend with ?
# Right lung nodule: Need follow up CT chest to document stability in 3 months time.
Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for GI upset.
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: hold or titrate dose down for INR > 3.5 (goal INR 2.5-3.5).
Will likely need to increase to [**Hospital1 **] dosing if/when patient running positive or weight trending up.
BP 130/50 O2 sats 100% on trach mask fiO2 40%   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the ICU with low blood pressure related to pneumonia and decreased heart function.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
Call his office for an appointment ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2037**]  Follow up CT Chest (1-2 months) to follow up possible right sided pulmonary nodule to document stability
