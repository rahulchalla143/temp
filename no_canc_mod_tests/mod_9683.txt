A right upper quadrant ultrasound at that time showed cholelithiasis and sludge, and the patient had subsequent cholecystectomy with lysis of adhesions on [**2113-6-12**].
The patient had a fever to 102.8 postoperatively and elevated LFTs with an AST of 170, ALT 204, alkaline phosphatase 134, and right upper quadrant pain.
A MRCP was negative (no ductal dilatation or filling defects).
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for an ERCP on [**2113-6-14**], however, before the procedure could be completed, while she was lying on the table, the patient became hypoxic.
In the MICU, she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal, ejection fraction equals 60-70% and normal P.A.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 100.8, [**Known lastname **] pressure 124/70, heart rate 81, respiratory rate 18, and O2 saturation is 93% on room air.
Lungs:  Few bibasilar crackles, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES:  ALT of 180, AST of 85, alkaline phosphatase 200.
Iron 21, TIBC 224, TSH 0.57, ferritin 724, TRF 172.
T bilirubin 3.3 and downtrending, amylase 33, lipase 27.

The patient's urinalysis was negative, and the patient had no diarrhea, no nausea, and no vomiting, and felt well.
The ERCP was performed on [**6-16**], which revealed normal esophagus, normal stomach, normal duodenum, a single nonbleeding periampullary diverticulum with large opening was found on the rim of the major papilla.
Following stent placement, there was passage of sludge from the common bile duct.
The MIBI portion of the test was also normal showing no perfusion defects and an ejection fraction of about 83%.
A repeat chest x-ray was also normal with almost entire resolution of the bilateral pleural effusions which has been present following the first ERCP attempt.
