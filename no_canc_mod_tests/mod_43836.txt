Laboratories revealed a sodium of 97.
Urine osoms returned at 407.
Hepatitis C. 7.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 98.3, heart rate 97, blood pressure 182/76, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 97% on five liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
The heart examination was regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lung examination - loud snoring sounds, otherwise clear to auscultation.
There was 2+ pedal pulses.
Rectal examination - four large deep crater decubitus ulcers which appeared to probe to bone.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, Chem7 revealed a sodium 98, potassium 4.9, chloride 65, bicarbonate 23, blood urea nitrogen 10, creatinine 0.3, glucose 221.
Complete blood count revealed white blood cell count 23.2, hematocrit 40.8, platelet count 518,000, 90% neutrophils, 0% bands, 6% lymphocytes.
INR was 1.1.
Urinalysis showed specific gravity of 1.025, [**6-1**] red blood cells, [**2-24**] white blood cells, otherwise negative.
Urine osom 409.
Urine electrolytes were sodium less than 10, potassium 33, chloride less than 10, urine creatinine 50, urine urea 578, serum ammonia level 37, serum acetone level negative.
Serum osom 220.
Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with normal axis, nonspecific conduction delay, no ST changes, no T wave inversion.
Electrocardiogram was unchanged from a prior from [**2152-12-23**].
From a fluid and electrolyte standpoint, the patient presented with severe hyponatremia with a serum osmolality of 220 and a urine osmolality of 409.
The serum osmolality of 220 verified hyposmolar hyponatremia.
His dry mucous membranes suggested an element of hypovolemia as well, however, his blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio did not suggest significant volume depletion.
Given the severity of his low sodium and his mental status changes, the patient was treated with hypertonic saline with subsequent increase in his serum sodium from 98 on admission to 104 by hospital day number one.
His sodium continue to improve and the hypertonic saline was discontinued and the patient was later started on a one to 1.5 liter fluid restriction with continued resolution of his hyponatremia.
On the day of discharge, his serum sodium was 135.
Arterial blood gas was done which showed progressive hypercarbia and the patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
After intubation, the patient became hypotensive requiring the addition of Levophed for a systolic blood pressure in the 60s.
His fever workup included blood cultures one out of four positive for gram positive cocci and enterococcus with greater than 100,000 colonies, however, with a urinalysis which showed no nitrites and no leukocyte esterase raising suspicion for colonization of the suprapubic catheter without active infection.
The patient was, however, continued to be treated with Levofloxacin and Vancomycin was later discontinued as his fever curve trended down and the identification of the organism from the blood culture was coagulase negative Staphylococcus which was felt to be a contaminant.
Chest x-ray showed multifocal opacities which was suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
