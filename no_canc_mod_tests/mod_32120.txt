History of Present Illness: 86y RHF with HTN, HL, afib on amio/BB/warfarin(INR=2.4@OSH) was air-lifted from [**Hospital3 7569**] this morning out of concern for acute stroke.
Her VS and labs were unremarkable, except for 1. her INR therapeutic in the mid-2s, 2. elevated T.bili 1.7 and AST/ALT each in the 50s, unexplained.
A NCHCT was performed, which was negative for e/o hemorrhage, but + for dense Left-MCA sign (elongated dense mid-to-distal-M1).
We got a NCHCT here, which confirmed absence of hemorrhage; CTA head/neck revealed near-total obstuction of the distal M1 on the Left, as well as collateral filling of several distal MCA-distribution vessels; CTP showed increased MTT throughout the Left MCA distribution, with a mismatched CBV result (mildly decreased volume in the Left MCA distribution, in contrast to the dramatically increased MTT; CBF was moderately decreased).
Their angiography appears to confirm the M1 occlusion as well as collateral late filling distal MCA-vessels from what appears to me to be a branch of the ?
A stat NCHCT after the procedure revealed swelling and hyperintensity in the caudate/putamen and GP on the side of the infarct, with mass effect into the R-LV; difficult to tell at this stage how much is contrast dye from the [**Doctor First Name 10788**] procedure vs. how much is hemorrhagic conversion related to the procedure in the setting of INR 1.9.
CAD/CHF with multivalvular disease including MR (details unknown to me at this time) s/p PPM 4.

CXR : [**2159-2-3**]:  Severe cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema have improved since [**2-1**], subsequently unchanged.
Their angiography appears to confirm the M1 occlusion as well as collateral late filling distal MCA-vessels from what appears to me to be a branch off the middle meningeal artery.

On examination she did very little and this did not improve throughout her course.
Neurologic: - She was started ASA ([**1-29**]), and maintain BP goals between 120 and 160.
For risk factor reduction her LDL was 34.
A TTE: EF 55-60%, Mild symmetric LVH, [**12-17**]+ MR, 3+ TR.
Goal INR [**1-18**].
A PEG was then placed on [**2159-2-7**].
"Lasix as needed" (dose unknown) 2. warfarin 2.5mg 5d/wk and 1.25mg 2d/wk 3. amiodarone 200mg daily 4. metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] 5. synthroid 112mcg once daily 6d/wk 6.
Lovaza (omega-3 FAs) 1gm cap [**Hospital1 **] 10.
MVI 13. warm prune juice, per son 14. metamucil 15.
You had a repeat CT of your head and this showed some conversion of the stroke to a hemorrhage.
