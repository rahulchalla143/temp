Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared to the prior study of [**2154-6-6**], there is no definite change.
Compared to prior study from [**6-5**], there is an ill-defined increased opacity in the left lower lobe, could be atelectasis.
COMPARISON: Abdominal radiograph dated [**2154-6-9**] and CT abdomen and pelvis dated [**2154-6-8**]  FINDINGS: There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
However, there was an area of relative decreased echogenicity in the right gland, corresponding to the CT abnormality.
This area was sampled with an 18-gauge 20- cm [**Last Name (un) 4300**] needle.
The needle was then removed, and the sample was sent for Gram stain and culture.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] culture and urine culture grew coag + staph and enterococcus.
Once final sensitivities revealed a coag + staph and enterococcus which were both sensitive to Vancomycin, the patient was started on Vancomycin and Daptomycin was discontinued.
CT scan was performed to eval for abscess, prostate necrosis / abscess.
Source was felt to be most likely prostatic given coag + staph and bacteroides grew out of the fluid drained from the prostate.
[**Name2 (NI) **] cultures showed positive for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans on [**6-5**].
Optho evaluation was negative for retinitis.
--- Patient to follow-up with ID for further management [**2154-7-10**] [**Hospital **] Medical Building [**Hospital1 18**] 10:30 AM --- Patient to have repeat prostatic ultrasound as outpatient for further evaluation of prosatic abscess.
Elevated again after dye load from CT scan on [**6-8**].
