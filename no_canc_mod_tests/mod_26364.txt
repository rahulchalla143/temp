The patient decompensated early am on the day of transfer with sats in the mid 80s, requiring Dopamine gtt to maintain MAP > 65.

However he remained difficult to wean and on physical examination was found to have parodoxical breathing pattern.
ABG demonstrated good ventilation and oxygenation and the pt was extubated.
Diaphragmatic dysfunction: The pt was not previously not known to have any signficant neuropathy and the dx of diaphragment dysfunction was further investigated.
His physical examination was consistent with some amount of lower motor neuron weakness in his right leg, which was found to be fairly severe.
Blood cultures from [**12-27**] revealed no growth, but wound cultures grew pan-sensitive serratia marscens.
Blood cultures from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**] showed no growth.
The patient developed fever and had increasing WBC to 13.9 on [**1-4**].
Blood, urine, lung, abscess, and line sources were considered.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn on [**2-14**], and [**1-5**], and have shown no growth to date.
Repeat U/S of the R thigh collection revealed a shrinking collection of fluid but persistent cellulitis.
Vascular surgery reiterated their contention that the fluid collection did not represent an abscess.
Sputum gr st from [**1-3**] showed GNR and GPC, but cultures showed no growth.
Repeat sputum gr st and cx on [**1-5**] were clean.
However, though pulmonary edema was minimal on CXR upon arrival to CCU, peripheral edema and JVD were still markedly increased.
Echocardiography from [**12-30**] showed a LVEF of 40-45%, but qualitatively described LV function as mildly depressed with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis.
Repeat echocariography on [**1-3**] was not able to assess LV function due to technical considerations.
After transfer to the MICU, the pt was stabilized from an infection/sepsis standpoint and with resultant improvement in his blood pressure, he was able to be diuresed more aggressively.
The pt should continue to be diuresed to achieve a goal of neg 500cc to 1000cc/day until he regained his dry body weight or until his creatinine and/or bicarbonate demonstrated signs of increase.
Until then, he should have routine electrolytes monitored to better assess his renal function and his body weight as well as daily ins and outs should be monitored to verify appropriate diuresis.
Cardiac Ischemia: The patient arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] with CEs under threshold levels for acute MI, but by [**1-1**], the patient's troponin reached 0.12.
However his EKGs were not consistent with sigificant ichemic changes.
CEs again increased to their peak of TrT of 1.5 and CK-MB of 15 on [**1-2**].
EKG again showed no significant ST changes and the patient was asymptomatic.
A decision re: re-initiation of plavix should be made in consultation with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**] and vascular surgeon as an outpt.
The patient was also on chronic anticoagulation at home with coumadin with a goal INR of [**12-27**].
Additionally, blood gas analysis revealed likely a chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis as well as a primary metabolic alkalosis, likely a contraction alkalosis secondary to aggressive diuresis.
In addition to LV [**Name2 (NI) 66438**], swan tracings were noteable for a SVR ranging from 500 to 600.
Pulmonary consult team recommended a number of studies that might identify the cause of primary pulm HTN including HIV Ab, Scleroderma Ab, [**Doctor First Name **], and RF (all neg).
In response to iNO rx, BP increased and PAP decreased, which was taken as a verification of the diagnosis of pulm HTN.
It was planned to transfuse the patient if HCT drops below 21.
A decision re: re-initiation of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation should be made after discussion with his PCP and cardiologist as an outpt.
