Initially reported to [**Location (un) 620**] ED and had an ECHO there which showed EF of 55%, new RV dilation but otherwise intact new valve.
Given her recent cardiac surgery, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the ED patient was noted to have vitals upon arrival of: T afebrile, HR 105, BP 90s/50s, O2Sat 100% on BiPAP.
Patient coughed up green-yellow sputum and in setting of WBC of 13, was started on Vanc and Zosyn.
CXR without obvious focal process.
Patient noted to be in [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr of 2.8.
Potassium was initially 6.7 and confirmatory potassium was 7.4.
Vitals prior to transfer to the MICU were: T afebrile, HR 105, BP 115/65, 100% on CMV FiO2 100% (Intubated with CMV mode PEEP 5, VT400, RR 14).
Physical Exam: Admission PE: VS: temp 95 hr 98 bp 85/54 rr 14% Sat 100% on 400/5/14/70% GEN: Sedated, localizes to pain.
Discharge PE: Tm=97.6, Tc=95.4, HR=90s-110s, BP=120s-130s/60s-70s, RR=22, POx=99% RA GEN: Pleasant, elderly female in NAD HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, dry MM, OP clear.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-5-18**] atrial fibrillation is new.
[**6-27**] CXR: FINDINGS: The study is compromised secondary to respiratory motion resulting in blurring of the lung bases.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-6-27**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Acute on chronic kidney injury: Her creatinine was elevated at 2.8 on admission and peaked at 3.7.
Currently her creatinine is down to 2.3 from a baseline of low 1s.
Urine sediment demonstrated oxalate crystals with evidence of tubular injury, consistent with ATN.
A renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.
Diuresis with Lasix should be continued according to her volume status as described below and her creatinine should be trended.
Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Her last EF=45% on an ECHO performed on [**7-2**].
Her metoprolol has been titrated up to 75mg TID and her heart rate should continue to be monitored on telemetry in order to further titrate her beta blocker to maintain a heart rate between 60-90. .

You also developed some kidney injury which resolved and a fast heart rate which was controlled with medications.
