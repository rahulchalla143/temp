She was taken to [**Hospital 3320**] Med Center where she received a CNS and C-spine CT scan.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
On 11/ 9/ 08 her EEG was negative at [**Hospital 3320**] hospital.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-1-14**] Q-T interval prolongation and marked anterolateral T wave inversion with inferior compponent has resolved.
Followup imaging is recommended.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2180-9-4**] at 2:01:58 PM Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior report (images not available for review) of [**2173-1-15**], left ventricular systolic function is improved.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure is similar.
Her hospital course by problem is as follows: 1) NEUROLOGICALLY: An MRI was therefore obtained to evaluate for possible underlying amyloid angiopathy.
Her MRI did not however reveal this or an underlying mass, stroke or vessel abnormality.
A non-fasting Lipid panel was checked which showed Total cholesterol 186, LDL of 113, HDL of 39.
2) CARDIAC: Ms. [**Known lastname 36900**] BP remained elevated and her initial BP was 207/73.
A TTE was therefore obtained which showed no evidence of aortic stenosis.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also monitored on telemetry and did not have evidence of dysthymias.
Cardiac enzymes were checked on admission for possible ischemia causing syncope.
Her initial troponin was 0.02 but repeats showed a gradual increase to 0.03 and then 0.04.
Cardiology was therefore involved for further assessment of these changes.
