Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated a 50% lesion in the LMCA.
Graft angiography demonstrated a svg to the mid LAD witha 70% proximal lesion, instent restenosis with evidence of thrombus.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a pcwp of 25mmHG and RVEDP of 20mm Hg.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension was present with a PAP of 63mm Hg.
Cardiac output was normal at 4L/min.
Left main disease, and instent restenosis of SVG-LAD graft.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to inferior posterior hypokinesis.
[**12-1**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the inferior vena cava catheter has been removed.
The remaining monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
# Coronary artery disease and catheterization complications - Patient admitted for pre-hydration prior to catheterization.
Sputum grew sparse mold, without any pathogens.
Urinary tract infection:  Weeks into the hospitalization, while on the regular medical floor, the patient became acutely lethargic and cultures were taken.
Urinalysis was highly suggestive of infection and she was empirically started on Cipro.
Her urine culture grew E.coli, resistant to Cipro, and her antibiotic regimen was changed to Cefpodoxime for a course of 3 more days (total of 7).
Renal ultrasound was obtained to r/o abcess which was negative for abscess or pylo .
A LUE ultrasound revealed a non-occlusive thrombus in the basilic vein with extension in the subclavian.
She was not started on heparin due to ongoing melenotic stools as well as a hematocrit in the low 20s.
Her UTI and left hand cellulitis caused another acute change in her mental status, which improved with proper treatment of these infections.
Baseline Cr thought to be 1.6 or so.
She was extensively diuresed with lasix and metolazone, and her kidney function eventually improved and she had good urine output.
She was started on her home dose of lasix, but her creatinine bumped once again and her losartan and lasix were held.
