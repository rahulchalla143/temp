EKG [**2104-3-11**] demonstrated V paced at 20 bmp.
EKG [**2104-1-27**] demonstrated V paced at 67 and occasional VPBs.
ECHO [**2104-1-29**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT head [**2104-3-11**]: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
MR is more sensitive for the evaluation of acute brain ischemia.
CXR [**2104-3-12**]:   The endotracheal tube, right IJ central line, leads of the pacemaker are in satisfactory, stable positions.
Pt was monitored on telemetry, staying mostly in sinus and with a rate between 60-80. .
Since pt had 1+ peripheral edema and mild pulmonary edema on CXR it was thought pt was in mild acute diastolic heart failure.
EKG without changes.
Continued HCTZ, isosorbide, and BB, CCB restarted after ICD adjustment.
