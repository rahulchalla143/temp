She was brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where she was found to be hypoxic to 87% on RA, Head CT neg, CXR showed fluffy bilateral infiltrates read as pulmonary edema, shoulder and pelvic XRay without fracture, and CT neck showed "subacute C2 fracture."
She received Ceftriaxone and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for further management.
She has had a 24 hour holter monitor during a symptomatic episode, which showed sinus bradycardia in the 50s.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2150-10-4**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
-CXR [**2150-12-30**]: Diffuse bilateral opacities may represent pulmonary edema or ARDS, although infectious process not excluded.
-C-SPINE (AP, FLEX & EXT): No significant interval change.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-9-5**], the apparent pulmonary artery systolic pressure is markedly increased.
CXR [**2150-12-31**]: AP chest compared to [**12-30**] and baseline examination [**5-15**]: Symmetrically distributed coarse peribronchial opacification is probably pulmonary edema worsening in some areas of the lungs, relatively sparing others because of emphysema and relatively mild pulmonary fibrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Upon admission to the medicine team, she was afebrile, but had a chest xray concerning for multilobular pneumonia, and possibly also for changes consistent with pulmomnary fibrosis from Amiodarone, which she had been taking since [**2144**] for A Fib.
Over a period of four days her oxygen requirement improved from 6 liters to 3 liters and she seemed to be markedly improving.
She continued to have a pulse, but was bradycardic to low 30s, with BP 60/palp.
About 1 minute into the drip, HR was >100 and SBP rose to 210.
Her post-arrest lactate was 7.2, but by midnight it was 1.7.
Of note, she had a BNP of 9540.
On [**1-7**], tube feeds were started, and a CT of her chest was interpreted as an acute CHF exacerbation superimposed on chronic Amiodarone lung toxicity processes.
Weaning from the vent remained [**Name (NI) 2480**], and discussions were held with the patient's son and family meetings arranged.
She did spike a temp of 100.9 and had cultures and C Diff studies sent, all of which were ultimately negative.
