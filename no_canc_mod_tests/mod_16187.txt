Subsequently his urine output started to decline.
He then received a normal saline bolus which improved his blood pressure and heart rate.
Congestive heart failure with EF of approximately 15% attributed to ischemia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission vital signs were temperature of 98.7, heart rate 115, blood pressure 114/60, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Heart tachycardiac, regular, [**4-6**] holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border, left ventricular heave.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count 6.1, hematocrit 37.4, platelets 163.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.9, chloride 99, CO2 20, BUN 103, creatinine 3.9, glucose 138.
Magnesium 2.7, phosphate 5.4, calcium 9.4, albumin 3.4.
ALT 36, AST 29, LK 294, LDH 352.
CK 186, MB 7, troponin 0.08.
Urinalysis was clean.
EKG was v-paced with 100% capture rate of 115 with magnet rate of 60, sinus tachycardia with left bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with preserved redistribution, no infiltrates, blunting of costophrenic angle on right.
An echo to evaluate for possible cardioversion showed an apical thrombus, thus, cardioversion was contraindicated.
He was started on heparin and Coumadin for this thrombus with an INR goal of 2 to 3.
In addition, his hematocrit declined and he needed to be transfused during the hospitalization to maintain hematocrit above 28 as he has known heart failure and coronary artery disease.
