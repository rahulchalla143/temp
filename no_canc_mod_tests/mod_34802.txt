ABG drawn at that time was notable for a respiratory alkalosis and hypoxemia 7.58/32/55 on FiO2 50%.
CXR per report showed a consolidation and was given vancomycin and zosyn.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 100.6 P: 140 BP: 135/88 R: 18 O2 sat 100% on trach mask.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with ST depression in V3.
CXR showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities and mild congestion.

ECHO [**2130-5-3**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-3-1**], the LV is more dilated.
Chest x-ray [**2130-5-4**]: Tracheostomy tube remains in place.
Lung volumes are larger compared to the previous study, and positional differences limit comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 year old male with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and recent right MCA stroke status-post tracheostomy and PEG-tube who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with worsening shorness of breath for one day and CXR consistent with CHF.
Chest x-ray shows evidence of congestion with large left sided effusion and small right sided effusion.
Low suspicion at this time for cardiac ischemia and cardiac enzymes did not suggest acute infarct.
Atrial Fibrillation:  His heart rate was generally 70-100 although he has periods of rapid ventricular response.
Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  As above; EF 25% again on this admission.
CXR on [**2130-5-4**] showed marked improvement from initial CXR in regards to fluid removal on diuresis.
Urinary Tract Infection:  UA from emergency room with evidence of infection, however culture did not show infection.
Hypertension:  Blood pressures were low during this admission, initially with systolics in the 90s.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 1,000 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: by g-tube.
Magnesium Hydroxide 800 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ml PO once a day as needed for constipation.
