NPH 30 units am and 20 units pm.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.8, heart rate 80, blood pressure 175/53, respiratory rate 24, and oxygen saturation is 99%.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Rectal examination was guaiac negative.
PERTINENT LABORATORIES AND DIAGNOSTICS ON ADMISSION:  The patient had a Chem-7 which revealed a sodium of 135, potassium of 5.2, chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 34, creatinine of 1.7, and a glucose of 245.
Patient's complete blood count revealed a white count of 7.7, hematocrit of 33.6, normal differential, MCV of 89.
Patient's cardiac enzymes:  First set CK 453, CK MB 5, troponin 1.8.
Second set CK 357, CK MB 4, troponin 1.8.
Third set:  CK 224, CK MB 4, troponin 2.2.
Fourth set:  CK 257, CK MB 4, troponin 2.4.
Patient's calcium was 8.3, phosphorus 2.9, magnesium 3.2.
Coagulation profile revealed a PT of 13.6, PTT of 29.6, and an INR of 1.2.
Fractional excretion of sodium was 3.4%, creatinine clearance was 80.
Urinalysis revealed moderate blood and moderate protein.
Chest x-ray was consistent with cardiomegaly and diffuse bilateral pulmonary vasculature enlargement consistent with congestive heart failure.
Abdominal KUB revealed no free air, no obstruction, and positive stool.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 66 beats per minute, left axis deviation, P-R interval of 206, Q's in III and aVF, T-wave flattening in I and aVL, and no ST-T changes.
He was admitted continued symptoms to rule out myocardial infarction as well as workup for his increased creatinine of 1.7.
Procedures:  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2177-6-9**], which revealed a right dominant coronary vasculature, no significant obstructive disease with normal flow, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 30 mm Hg, and systolic hypertension.
The patient underwent an echocardiogram on [**6-10**], which revealed mild left atrial dilatation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, a resting basal to mid inferior akinesis and basal to mid inferolateral hypokinesis and akinesis, RVH, right ventricular cavity dilatation, mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular pressure and volume overload, mild aortic and mitral and tricuspid valve thickening, mild-to-moderate AR, mild MR, moderate TR, left ventricular inflow consistent with pseudonormal pattern with increased left sided filling pressures and impaired left ventricular relaxation, severe pulmonary artery hypertension, and an ejection fraction of 55%.
The patient underwent a VQ scan on [**6-12**] which was negative for embolic disease and was suggestive of central airway disease.
The patient underwent a chest CT scan on [**2177-6-12**] which was suggestive of congestive heart failure, although there was a mention of very mild enlargement of hilar lymph nodes to a nonpathologic degree as well as mention of a small nodule measuring several mm in the lung fields.
The patient underwent a cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**6-13**], which revealed mild global ventricular dysfunction with regional dysfunction of the distal anterolateral and septal walls as well as the apex.
The patient underwent a right heart cardiac catheterization on [**2177-6-16**].
The patient's pulmonary artery pressures had decreased from the previous cardiac catheterization from 111 to 59, but the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was still at around 30.
Preliminary studies on the right ventricular biopsy had been negative for any infiltrative disease.
Further studies were pending at the time of this dictation.
However, cardiac catheterization showed no coronary artery disease.
Pulmonary artery hypertension:  The workup mentioned above under the procedure section was performed to elicit a cause of the patient's pulmonary hypertension.
Acute renal failure versus chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's fractional excretion of sodium was greater than 3% suggesting that the patient had intrinsic renal disease.
His creatinine improved from 1.9 on admission to 1.2 the day prior to transfer to the CCU.
His creatinine did start to increase slightly with further diuresis throughout the hospital stay.
Documentation of high pulmonary capillary wedge pressures on cardiac catheterization prompted the team to aggressively diurese the patient with Lasix.
Iron studies were not significant for iron deficiency.
B12 and folate levels were normal.
A malaria smear was obtained and it too was negative.
