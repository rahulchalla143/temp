CTA [**7-18**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
There are also prominent superior mediastinal lymph nodes which were not present on previous study.
The patient had a CTA chest performed to rule out PE and dissection, notable for sternal dehiscence, moderate pericardial effusion and fat stranding with lymphadenopathy.
EKG with diffuse PR depressions and ST elevations.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
On hospital day #2, the pt became febrile to a temperature of 101.2.
CXR showed atelectasis at the lung bases; CXR, UA and urine culture, and blood cultures were nonsuggestive of infection.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for the possibility of infection secondary to sternal dehiscence; however, the CT team felt that there was no clinical evidence to support this.
The patient was monitored on telemetry for the duration of the hospital stay with no significant events.
