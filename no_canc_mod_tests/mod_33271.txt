He was intubated, afterwhich he underwent a CT of the head, which showed a small parenchymal hemorrhage in the R anterior inferior frontal lobe.
He was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible meningitis, and had an LP which had pink cloudy fluid, containing 4500 RBCs and 6 WBCs.
While he was at [**Hospital3 15402**], he was noted to have a Tmax of 103, and was also found to have a WBC count of 29.
Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

(Stable when compared to OSH CT) # CT Head ([**2103-6-25**]): * Stable right frontal hemorrhagic contusion; improving right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage collections.
# CT Head ([**2103-7-4**]): * No areas of new hemorrhage or evidence for new infarct.
OTHER IMAGING STUDIES # CT C-spine ([**2103-6-23**]): * No acute fractures or alignment abnormalities.
# CTA head/neck ([**2103-6-24**]): * Areas of intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhages described above, the one in the right temporal region, mildly increased compared to the prior study as described and new areas noted in the right parietal/frontal location,new/more obvious.
# CXR ([**2103-6-25**]): changes consistent with aspiration PNA # CXR ([**2103-6-30**]): clear.
Clinical examination revealed new anisicoria with a left pupil larger than the right.
The patient's dilantin level was checked and found to be in a goal range of [**9-4**] UNcorrected by albumin.
CT scans demonstrated no new hemorrhage; in fact, repeat images supported interval improvement in the frontal contusion noted at the time of admission.
# Infectious Disease: * Possible Meningitis: At the time of presentation, the patient was noted to be febrile with a leukocytosis (wbc 29).
When the CSF cultures performed at [**Hospital3 **] were confirmed to be negative ([**2103-6-25**]), the ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and ampicillin were discontinued.
Of note, at the time of discharge, the HSV PCR was still pending per [**Hospital6 302**].
* Right Lower Extremity Cellulitis: Initial clinical examination was notable for a circumferential area of blanching erythema in the right lower extremity from the medial malleolus to the level of tibial tuberosity.
A right lower extremity venous duplex study showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
* Possible Aspiration Pneumonia: At the time of transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was intubated with an elevated temperature and white blood cell count as noted above.
A chest x-ray was thought to show changes consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
By [**2103-6-30**], repeat chest films were clear.
The patient had oxygen saturations consistently over 92% on ambient air for several days prior to discharge.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).
Neurologic examination is notable for orientation limited to self and general location 'hospital,' dysarthric, non-fluent language with anomia, subtle anisicoria (left pupil > right), right facial droop, generalized hyperreflexia, and stable right hemiparesis.
Imaging studies revealed some bruising in the front part of your brain.
