Prior to his presentation at the cutaneous oncology clinic, an incisional biopsy had been done into the mass, revealing metastatic melanoma.
During the course of his evaluation which included a CT-PET scan, he was found to have an upper mediastinal mass in addition to his large left neck mass.
A chest CT was obtained, and this was felt to probably be of thyroid origin.
A fine needle aspiration was then completed and this demonstrated cells suggestive of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
