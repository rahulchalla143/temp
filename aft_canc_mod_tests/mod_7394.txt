Her weight has been fluctuating a great deal from 107 to 117, though on a higher side recently 6 pound weight gain to 124 and worsened lower extremity edema.
In the Emergency Department, she had a respiratory rate of 4 and oxygen saturation of 85% on 5 liters.
A total of 0.5 mg of Narcan was given, and the initial chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions.
Blood pressure dropped until 5 pm it was 69 systolic.
Severe pulmonary hypertension by catheterization in [**2108**].
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease with a FVC of 2.2, FEV1 of 0.81, this was 52% of predicted, FEV1/FVC ratio of 55%.
Congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic dysfunction in [**2106**], to have normal coronary arteries on catheterization followed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature is 96.5, pulse is 75, blood pressure 106/68, respiratory rate of 24, sat 85 which decreased to the 70s and increased to 90's with deep breathes on a Ventimask at 5 liters.
Extremity examination showed 3+ left and 3+ right lower extremity pitting edema up to the thighs.

There was a question of infiltrate on her initial chest x-ray consistent with pneumonia, and in addition her history of congestive obstructive pulmonary disease along with new abdominal distention and oxygen retention from her increased O2 likely cause of altered mental status and worsened pulmonary status.
Gastrointestinal:  Abdominal CT scan was obtained given the history and increased LFTs.
CT scan of the abdomen showed a significant ascites, multiple hepatic lesions consistent with metastatic cancer, a right adrenal mass thought to be an adenoma, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and bilateral pleural effusions.
She had a paracentesis while in-house, which 1 liter of fluid was removed, however, it was difficult to continue removal of fluid given that it was in multiple pockets in the abdomen.
