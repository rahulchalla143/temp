He ruled out for myocardial infarction there and then underwent stress testing revealing reversible ischemia.
On [**2141-11-4**] he developed recurrent chest pain with anterolateral ST depressions and ruled in with a troponin of 3.55 and CK 199.
His precatheterization hematocrit was 26.7 and for this he received a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells.
Cardiac catheterization subsequently revealed a 90% left anterior descending coronary artery lesion at the origin of the D1, 80% distal left circumflex lesion, 80% acute marginal lesion, the left anterior descending coronary artery lesion underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting with a resultant jailed D1.
A PA catheter demonstrated a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 toward the end of the procedure.
At the end of the case the patient developed hypotension with a drop in the systolic blood pressure to the 60s, nitroglycerin was discontinued.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed in the catheterization laboratory that ruled out a pericardial effusion.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE CATHETERIZATION LABORATORY: 1.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE CORONARY CARE UNIT: Heart rate 85.
Temperature 98.
Blood pressure 149/95.
Lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.2, hemoglobin 9.0, hematocrit 26.0, platelets 320, MCV 86, PT 12.8, PTT 26.7, INR 1.1, sodium 140, potassium 4.0, chloride 107, bicarb 21, BUN 11, creatinine 0.9, glucose 84, CK 152, troponin 20.8, MB 7.
Electrocardiogram post catheterization sinus tachycardia at 113 beats per minute, axis negative 45 with normal intervals, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in lead 2, loss of R wave V1 to V3 with poor R wave progression.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 21207**] suffered an anteroseptal myocardial infarction evidenced by loss of R waves on his electrocardiogram from V1 to V3.
Following cardiac catheterization his CK peak was 940.
On [**2141-11-7**] he underwent repeat transthoracic echocardiogram, which demonstrated EF 30%, slightly enlarged left atrium, no left ventricular hypertrophy, no left ventricular thrombus.
Cardiac catheterization with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery.
