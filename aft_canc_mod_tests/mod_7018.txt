The patient called EMS, where she was noted to be tachypneic and tachycardic as well as hypoxic, with oxygen saturation approximately 82% on [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Department.
In the Emergency Department, she had electrocardiogram demonstrating new right heart strain, and CT angiogram was performed, demonstrating evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli.
The patient was started on heparin, and echocardiogram was performed at the bedside, demonstrating right ventricular dilatation and paroxysmal subtotal wall motion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 120 to 145, blood pressure 152/62, oxygen saturation 100% on 100% non-rebreather, respiratory rate 26 to 40.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Lungs:  Dullness to percussion at the right base, and decreased breath sounds.
LABORATORY DATA:  CT of the head was negative for bleed or metastases.
CT angiogram showed bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia, normal axis, new S1 Q3, intraventricular conduction delay with right bundle morphology.
Chest x-ray with right basilar opacity consistent with right pleural effusion.
The patient underwent lower extremity Dopplers to find the source of the clot.
Hematocrit decreased to 22.
The patient was transfused four units of packed red blood cells with increase of hematocrit to 26.
No further blood transfusions were required.
The patient's blood pressure slowly increased during time.
The patient was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day, with close attention to her blood pressure.
Secondary to her acute illness and her thrombocytopenia, these were not performed in-house.
