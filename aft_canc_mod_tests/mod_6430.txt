[**Name (NI) **] given 2 weeks ago, WBC 30's on D/C [**4-16**].
The pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing monitoring and care.
CT scan of his neck and torso was performed revealing multiple pulmonary nodules and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, concerning for metastasis.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2184-4-16**] with severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, dehydration and severe fatigue and was discharged [**2184-4-21**].
He received granulocyte stimulating factor, RBC and platelet transfusion while in the hospital.
Upon admission, he [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] CT scan of chest revealing innumerable pulmonary parenchymal metastases in the bilateral lungs, extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, osseous lesion in the left second and third ribs and T7 vertebral body.
He also had CT scan  of head.

CT chest [**5-2**]: 1.
Innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar, mediastinal, and left axillary adenopathy consistent with metastatic disease, slightly progressed since the prior study.
EEG [**5-2**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to the slow and disorganized background suggestive of a widespread encephalopathy.
Metabolic disturbances, medications, and infection are the most common causes.
CXR [**5-3**]: Partially obscuring many of the large nodules in both lungs is a process which could be pulmonary edema or rapidly developing pneumonia, worse in the right lung and all new since [**5-1**].
MRI head [**5-5**]: 1.
His AMS was most likely due to increased edema from cancer mets seen on CT and MRI head, as well as from acute hypercapnia (see below).
He was initially treated for possible HAP with Vanc and Zosyn, although CT was not suggestive of PNA and these were stopped.
He was started on oseltamavir for possible influenza, as his granddaughter had confirmed swine flu, but this was discontinued as DFA and viral culture were negative.
He was started on dexamethasone for brain vasogenic edema due to metastases, as seen on CT and MRI head.
Hematuria: Initially had a negative UA, but repeat UA due to initial culture being contaminated showed many RBCs with few calcium oxalate crystals.
We did an MRI to characterize your brain metastases, and you will follow up with radiation oncology for treatment.
