He underwent an upper endoscopy in [**2190-5-24**] which basically revealed a friable, nonobstructing lower esophageal adenocarcinoma.
The ultrasound-guided staging was performed as well.
The ultrasound-guided examination of the mid-esophageal mass demonstrated invasion into the muscularis propria, but no evidence of invasion beyond this, consistent with a T2 tumor.
Careful examination of the remainder of the Barrett's esophagus demonstrated mild wall thickening to 4 mm, limited to the submucosa, with no focal masses noted.
A CT scan of the abdomen and chest was performed, which revealed two hyperdense lesions in the liver, but no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Subsequently an MRI of the liver was performed, which was negative for any evidence of metastatic disease to the liver.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.2, heart rate 69, blood pressure 153/72.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:  No evidence of lymphadenopathy.
Chest examination:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
IMAGING STUDIES:  Upper endoscopy performed in [**2190-5-24**] showed a friable, nonobstructing lower esophageal adenocarcinoma involving one-third of the esophageal circumference.
CT scan of the abdomen performed preoperatively showed two hyperdense lesions in the liver, but no mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.
The MRI of the liver performed preoperatively was negative for any evidence of metastatic disease in the liver.
His urine output was noted to be low.
His blood pressure and heart rate were controlled with beta blocker.
The heart rate and blood pressure remained stable.
On [**2190-10-1**], chest x-ray was taken showing a slight interval increase in the left lower lobe consolidation/collapse.
His urine output increased and remained stable.
A barium swallow study was performed on [**2190-10-2**], which showed no evidence of contrast extravasation from the esophagogastric anastomosis.
His vital signs were stable except for a respiratory rate of 28.
Electrocardiogram obtained at the time showed no change from the baseline.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2190-10-8**] to rule out pericardial effusion.
A chest x-ray at the time showed right basilar atelectasis/consolidation.
The echocardiogram mentioned previously showed an ejection fraction of 25%.
On [**2190-10-10**], the serum troponin levels were 6.5 at their peak.
A chest x-ray obtained on [**2190-10-10**] showed probable congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size since the previous study.
The patient's creatinine was also noted to be increasing, peaking at 2.4, with BUN of 100.
The patient's BUN and creatinine subsequently improved.
The sputum culture from [**2190-10-9**] grew Enterobacter, E. coli, and beta streptococcus.
His urine culture from [**2190-10-11**] grew Klebsiella, which again was pansensitive.
The pleural fluid obtained by thoracentesis on [**2190-10-12**] grew staphylococcus aureus (coagulase positive), which was sensitive to clindamycin, gentamicin, Rifampin and vancomycin, but resistant to oxacillin (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus).
The consequent pleural taps grew no bacteria.
His blood cultures remained negative.
He continued to receive serial chest x-rays.
He was started on vancomycin, given his methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, which was dosed according to serum levels.
His creatine kinase and troponins were negative for any signs of myocardial infarction, and his electrocardiogram was unchanged from baseline.
He was started on clears, and his diet was advanced to a gastrectomy-type diet, which he also tolerated well.
His hematocrit and white count remained stable, and his renal function returned to his baseline levels.
