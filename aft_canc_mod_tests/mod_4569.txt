CT scan to further evaluate did not show any evidence of DVT but revealed large prostate mass with bulky lymphadenopathy causing hydronephrosis.
Labs were notable for Hct of 34.7 from recent Hct of 43.3 on [**6-/2196**], Cr 1.3 (baseline 0.8) and INR of 2.9.
ED course complicated by development of afib with HR in 150s and given metoprolol 25mg PO x 2.
Admitted to the MICU for further hemodynamic monitoring.

Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to sigmoid colon at 40 cm Recommendations: Prostate palpable and firm on rectal examination.
Limited study given stool but no active bleeding or lesion noted to 40 cm.
Bone Scan: INTERPRETATION: Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections as well as spot images of the arms.
There is increased uptake at approximately L3 on the right and L5 on the left; on the CT of [**2196-11-23**] there are degenerative changes in these locations which may account for these findings.
No other bony findings  CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
EKG [**11-21**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Since the previous tracing of [**2196-7-7**] the rate is faster  [**11-26**]: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2196-11-21**] there is no diagnostic change  Discharge Labs:  [**2196-11-29**] 06:40AM BLOOD WBC-4.8 RBC-3.28* Hgb-9.8* Hct-29.8* MCV-91 MCH-29.9 MCHC-32.9 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-372 [**2196-11-28**] 04:14PM BLOOD Hct-32.2* [**2196-11-25**] 07:13AM BLOOD PT-15.6* PTT-24.9 INR(PT)-1.4* [**2196-11-28**] 06:55AM BLOOD Glucose-91 UreaN-17 Creat-1.0 Na-141 K-4.3 Cl-106 HCO3-29 AnGap-10 [**2196-11-29**] 06:40AM BLOOD Glucose-97 UreaN-21* Creat-1.0 Na-141 K-4.4 Cl-106 HCO3-29 AnGap-10 [**2196-11-28**] 06:55AM BLOOD ALT-21 AST-36 LD(LDH)-248 AlkPhos-71 TotBili-0.9 [**2196-11-26**] 07:40AM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-3.3 Mg-1.6  Brief Hospital Course: 76 y/oM with PMH afib on coumadin, new onset RLE swelling, and imaging suggestive on likely metastatic prostate CA who presented to the ED with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), no active bleeding on colonoscopy, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular reponse (RVR) that was rate controlled, presumed metastatic colon cancer treated with degarelix, and urinary retention secondary to an enlarged prostate treated with a foley and tamsulosin.
# BRBPR: Required 3 blood transfusions while in the ICU, initial flex sigmoidoscopy was negative for active bleeding.
Colonoscopy to cecum showed no active bleeding, but did reveal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis.
A post void bladder scan revealed 950cc of urine so Urology replaced foley.
# Presumed metastatic Prostate cancer: CT scan in [**10/2196**] showing enlarged prostatic mass, bulky lymphadenopathy obscuring neurovasculature (likely cause of RLE edema), and likely liver mets.
A bone scan was done which showed no bony lesions.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
You had a flexible sigmoidoscopy and a colonoscopy which showed no active source of bleeding.
You were seen by an Oncologist and were treated with a medication, degarelix, that will help treat your cancer.
You are going home with a foley as we did a post void bladder scan which showed 950cc of urine in your bladder.
We added a medication, tamsulosin, that should help shrink the prostate and make it easier to urinate.
