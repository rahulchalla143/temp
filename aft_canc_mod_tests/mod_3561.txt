[**2146-8-22**] ECHO Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function(LVEF>55%).
EGD [**2146-8-22**] Findings: Esophagus:  Mucosa: Moderate esophagitis with no bleeding was seen in the middle and lower thirds of the esophagus.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the middle third of the esophagus.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the stomach body and stomach antrum.
His electrolytes were supplemented potassium, magnesium and phosphate as patient recovered from DKA.
The patient underwent an EGD while in the hospital which revealed esophagitis and gastritis; therefore he was started on intravenous protonix [**Hospital1 **].
Inital EGD did not show varices or tear, but this was repeated due to retained contrast seen in the esophagus.
Repeat EGD showed esophagitis and gastritis, patient initally maintained on intravenous protonix [**Hospital1 **], but this was transitioned to prilosec [**Hospital1 **] PO for outpatient therapy.
INR and albumin normal suggesting normal synthetic function.
Hep B VL and Hep e Ag/Ab all negative.
However, ECG has evidence of possible old anteroseptal infact.
