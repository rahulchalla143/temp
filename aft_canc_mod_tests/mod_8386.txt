Admission Date:  [**2132-5-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2132-6-2**]   Service:  [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 78 year old male with a complex past medical history notable for non-small cell lung cancer, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] Thoracic Surgery Service on [**2132-5-16**], for preoperative evaluation for a planned mediastinoscopy with a right upper lobe resection scheduled for [**2132-5-19**].
Evaluation chest CT scan demonstrated a 3.2 centimeters right upper lobe mass and a 2 centimeter pre-carinal lymph node.
Subsequent needle biopsy was notable for non-small cell lung cancer.
A PET scan conducted [**2132-5-1**], demonstrated right sided primary lung cancer with activity in the right hilum, and no apparently involvement of other organs.
The patient was subsequently referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] for evaluation and thereafter scheduled for a mediastinoscopy with a right upper lobe resection on [**2132-5-19**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2132-5-16**], the patient was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] for preoperative heparinization.
per hour for a target PTT of 60 to 80.
The patient was successfully anti-coagulated without complication through [**2132-5-19**], at which point he underwent a mediastinoscopy with a right upper lobe resection.
The patient was subsequently successfully extubated in the Operating Room and transferred to the Recovery Room for further evaluation and management.
On postoperative check, the patient was noted to be afebrile and stable with a 91% oxygen saturation on a 40% face mask and a postoperative hematocrit of 32.2.
Secondary to a persistently coarse respiratory examination, the patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2132-5-21**], which demonstrated old obstructing blood clots with a greater preponderance in the right side versus the left side.
The patient was restarted on his Coumadin therapy but was shortly thereafter noted to be supra-therapeutic with an INR of 3.1.
Following identification of his super-therapeutic status, the patient was again noted to have transient worsening of his respiratory examination, instigating a repeat bronchoscopy on [**2132-5-23**].
Repeat bronchoscopy demonstrated a complete obstruction of the right main stem, right middle lobe and right lower lobe bronchi with blood clots and thick secretions, which were all subsequently removed with suction.
The patient was thereafter begun on aggressive chest Physical Therapy and an aspiration work-up was begun.
Serial video swallow studies were thereafter obtained, which initially demonstrated total intolerance of thin liquids and marginal tolerance of soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
The patient was restarted on his Coumadin therapy and was subsequently gradually titrated to a target INR of 2.5.
Repeat chest CT scan demonstrated improved aeration within portion of the right middle and right lower lobes.
Repeat video swallow and barium swallow studies conducted on [**5-30**], demonstrated persistent but decreased aspiration of plain liquids and adequate tolerance of soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
The patient was thereafter noted to progress well clinically through postoperative day number 14, [**2132-6-2**], at which point he was cleared for discharge to an extended care facility for further evaluation and management, and was provided instructions for follow-up.
Coumadin dosage to be titrated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a target INR of 2.5 to 3.0.
