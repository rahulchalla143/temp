Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
**FINAL REPORT [**2103-9-14**]**     WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2103-9-14**]):       STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
Patient was continued on levophed started in ED and received fluid boluses to maintain CVP 8-12.
Blood cultures were followed, which grew out coag + staph aureus in [**5-2**] bottles.
CT scan was performed, which did not show abscess or evidence of obstruction associated with the PEG tube.
*Port was removed [**2103-9-11**], culture positive for MRSA.
*Surveillance blood cultures were sent, with negative cultures x 2 on [**2103-9-12**] *Patient remained hemodynamically stable, and the central line was discontinued on [**2103-9-18**] *PICC line was placed on [**2103-9-18**]  # DECREASED EF: On TTE, patient found to have new wall motion abnormalities suggestive of multivessel CAD.
ECHO revealed LVEF 25-30% with anteroseptal, apical, and inferiolateral hypokinesis.
has had several sets of cardiac enzymes drawn, all which were negative, although he did have T wave inversions in I, V1-V4 which were new from prior EKG done in [**2103-5-29**].
Patient's BP was stable and cardiogenic shock was very unlikely.
DIC labs were not suggestive of DIC.
EKG was performed which showed T wave inversions in lateral precordial leads.
Troponins were cycled which did not show evidence for acute MI.
Last CD4 count in our system was 738 on 3/[**2101**].
