During this most recent admission, the patient was treated for pneumonia and respiratory cultures grew pan-sensitive Step pneumo.
He also had CT chest and sinues which showed acute on chronic changes that were more concerning for bacterial infection, not fungal infection.
The patient reports having rigors and felt sick, which he why he went to OSH and as per report had temperature 103.
At admission he had a WBC of 3.3, Hct 11.5 and platelets of 5.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated a hypocellular marrow with cytogenetic abnormalities consistent with hypoplastic MDS (deletion 7q and 13).
Carotid pulses were absent, heart sounds were also absent.

Neutrophils (subset: 67%) show loss of GPI-linked protein.
The red blood cells do not show antigenic loss (patient has received blood transfusions).
Chimerism studies should be correlated.
Further confirmatory testing with FLAER (send-out) can be considered, if Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria is a differential diagnostic consideration.
KARYOTYPE ([**8-1**]: 46,XY[30])  Imaging: CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILIMPRESSION [**7-23**]:  Persistent opacities at the maxillary sinuses, ethmoidal, sphenoid and frontoethmoidal recesses as described above, with minimal improvement in the pattern of aeration, the attenuation in the paranasal sinuses is slightly heterogeneous, likely indicating inspissated secretions, the possibility of fungal colonization is also a consideration.
CT chest [**8-12**] IMPRESSION: Anterior right upper lobe ground-glass opacity, new since the beginning of [**Month (only) 958**], has not changed since [**7-10**].
The need for followup CT should be dictated by clinical symptoms.
CT ABD [**8-8**] IMPRESSION: 1.
His fevers persisted despite antibiotics and the patient ultimately had a bone marrow biopsy that showed evidence of HLH.
Head CT was concerning for subacute ischemic stroke.
He was given 4 amps of bicarb with little effect on his blood pressures.
Ultimately his BP was unable to sustain perfusion to his vital organs and he expired on [**2138-8-19**] at 1:18 AM.
Due to increased lethargy, a head CT was obtained which showed R sided hypodensity in the internal capsule/basal ganglia.
An MRI was recommended to better characterize this lesion.
Because this would require intubation and would not significantly alter management in the acute setting, MRI was deferred and blood pressures were monitored in the setting of a presumed infarct, initially allowing for permissive hypertension with SBPs into the 180s.
Stool studies and Cdiff were negative.
After developing nausea on [**8-17**] and having a bicarb of 12, he became unresponsive to IVF boluses as above.
The respiratory alkalosis was later attributed to a central process given the findings on head CT noted above.
# Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: The patient was found to have HLH on bone marrow biopsy, which would account for his high fevers.
He was transfused blood and platelets as needed to maintain Hgb <7, platelets <10.
His heart rates were monitored during the admission.
Blood bank was involved in screening the patient's blood to identify which specific antibodies were causing him to have recurrent transfusion reactions.
