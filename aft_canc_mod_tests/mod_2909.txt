Workup at outside hospital revealed white blood cell count of 11.6, amylase 2,164, lipase 5,997, total bilirubin of 6, and direct bilirubin of 4.2 with decreased transaminases.
Ultrasound showed gallstones with 1.1 common bile duct and a prominent pancreatic duct.
This showed an impacted stone in the major papilla which was extracted, however, the procedure was aborted secondary to patient desating to O2 saturations in the 50s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient had a temperature of 99.9, pulse of 108, blood pressure 147/59, respiratory rate 13, and sating 94% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
Urine output was approximately 50 cc an hour.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities:  Warm, no edema, and 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORIES:  White count of 27.5, hematocrit of 45.2, and platelets of 954.
Chemistries:  Sodium 141, potassium 3.4, chloride 104, bicarb 26, BUN 21, creatinine 0.9, glucose 141, calcium 6.9, magnesium 2.2, phosphorus 2.6, ALT 296, AST 247, alkaline phosphatase 508, total bilirubin 4.9 down from 6.0 at the outside hospital.
Albumin 3.3, amylase 946 which is down from [**2115**] at the outside hospital and lipase 2200 down from 6,000 at the outside hospital.
Chest x-ray showed no acute infiltrates.
CT scan of the abdomen showed pericholecystic fluid, pancreatic inflammation with dilated ducts.
Patient was given Morphine for pain and urine output was followed closely.
On the evening of first day of hospitalization, the total bilirubin was actually noted to increase of again after the initial decrease after the stone extraction.
the white blood cell count on repeat was noted to be 28 with the increasing bilirubin and increasing abdominal pain.
She had a temperature of 100.4 and her white blood cell count was 24.7 down from 29.
Also her amylase was down to 131 and her lipase down to 100.
The patient was continued NPO and white blood cell count also continued to trend downward.
She was also continued on meropenem and by postoperative day #3, was tolerating a regular diet was put on all po medications, and continued to have adequate urine output, and the patient's abdominal examination was benign.
Her LFTs were normal and white blood cell count was still elevated, however, it was trending downward.
However, her white blood cell count was elevated to 30 without any obvious source of infection.
Chest x-ray and urinalysis were performed, and were negative, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**], and the medical attending, as well as patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
