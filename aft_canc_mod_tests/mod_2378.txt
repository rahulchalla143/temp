- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
MRI revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle bilaterally.
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphom and he has remained in remission.

Imaging [**2162-5-25**] ECG Probable sinus tachycardia given patient's age but very rapid rate raises consideration of possible atrial tachycardia.
Since the previous tracing of [**2162-4-17**] tachycardic rate is faster.
[**2162-5-25**] Chest Xray IMPRESSION: Persistent pulmonary abnormalities with some more prominent patchy infiltrates in the right upper lobe area.
Lateral pleural effusion also progressing slightly since next preceding study of [**2162-5-10**].

A twelve hour creatine urine collection revealed a creatinine clearance of 52.
RUQ on [**5-26**] showed no biliary obstruction, however did show area of hypoechoic liver that would be best characterized by CT, but due to fear of damaging kidneys with contrast he had a repeat [**Month/Year (2) 950**] that showed a stable lesion.
He had a repeat [**Year (4 digits) 950**] which showed a stable thrombus.
