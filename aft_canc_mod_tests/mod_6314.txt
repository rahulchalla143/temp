No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2111-3-2**]: Significant bifrontal contusions, left occipital skull fx.
Head CT [**2111-3-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**2111-3-3**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere (LVEF= 30%).
LENIS [**2111-3-3**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
Diffuse moderate heterogeneous calcified plaque in the bilateral common carotid and internal carotid artery, left more than the right.
EEG [**2111-3-5**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous telemetry because of mild to moderate diffuse background slowing.
CT Head [**2111-3-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
EEG [**2111-3-6**]: IMPRESSION: This EEG is evidence for diffuse slowing of background frequencies into the theta and delta bandwidth.
LENIS [**2111-3-11**]: Negative for DVT  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU on the Neurosurgery service for frequent neuro checks and systolic blood pressure control less than 140.
He was given 2 units of FFP to reverse an INR of 2.4 and started on Vitamin K daily x 3 days.
Syncope work up was performed as the patient had no recollection of falling.
An EKG was done that revealed sinus rhythm with some ectopy.
A TTE was done that revealed mild left atrium dilation and an LVEF of 30%.
An EEG was done that revealed no seizures.
Carotid ultrasounds were performed that revealed: 1.
Diffuse moderate heterogeneous calcified plaque in the bilateral common carotid and internal carotid artery, left more than the right.
Lower extremity ultrasound was performed to assess for lower extremity DVT: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
It was thought that patient may have had a seizure and underwent an EEG that revealed no seizure activity on final read.
Bilateral lower extremity doppler ultrasound was performed for extended bedrest and was negative for DVT.
