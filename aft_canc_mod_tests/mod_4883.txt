At the OSH ED, she was noteded to have BRBPR and initial Hct of 25.3 from 30.5 on [**7-12**] and 34.4 on [**6-7**].
During her time in the OSH, she was initiated on hemodialysis per her nephrologist's recommendations.
Per the son, she had a colonoscopy that was not remarkable, except for polyps, last year.
At triage, HR 69, BP 167/66, RR 25, O2Sat 85% on BiPAP.
Bedside echocardiogram showed small pericardial effusion with left sided pleural effusion.
Upon transfer, HR 58, BP 142/58, RR 16, O2Sat 100% on FiO2 80%, TV 400, RR set 18, and PEEP of 10 with fentanyl and propofol for sedation.
Echo showed EF 50% with apical hypokinesis attributed NSTEMI during this admission although trop elevations are only modest considering renal function and CK/MB not elevated.
EKG notable for non-specific t-wave changes.
In terms of her GI bleed, she was found to have a large polyp leading to obstruction of pylorus.
Her last transfusion was today [**7-27**] with HD, at which time she got 1 unit PRBC.
Blood cultures drawn on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] grew MSSA, one out of four bottles.
Subsequent cultures x 6 days no growth to date.
She also had thrombocytopenia and Plt 142 on presentation, that decreased to nadir of 69.
Vitals in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] prior to transfer to floor were as follows: T 98.7, BP 128/64, P 70, RR 14, O2sat 99% 2L.

Imaging/diagnostics: - CXR ([**2129-7-20**]): 1.
- CXR ([**2129-7-22**]): .
- Echocardiogram ([**2129-7-21**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
- CXR ([**2129-7-25**]): In comparison with the study of [**7-24**], there is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
- EGD ([**2129-7-25**]): A 4cm pedunculated gastric polyp was found at the pylorus, prolapsing into duodenum.
An endoloop was placed at the base of the polyp and the polyp was pulled into the stomach for better visualization.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear was seen at the GE junction, continuing into the cardia.
CXR on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] most consistent with fluid overload, potentially from flash pulmonary edema in the setting of demand ischemia.
Echocardiogram showed pericardial effusion without tamponade.
She continued to have large pleural effusions and oxygen requirement of 3L NC on the floor.
Ultrafiltration was limited by blood pressures; because pt's blood pressures could not tolerate pulling off significant volume, she will require rehabilitation stay for period of time until enough fluid is removed to decrease oxygen requirement back to baseline.
Echocardiogram showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal/anterior/apical hypokinesis.
EKG was noted for anterior Qs in V1 V2 and TWI in V1-V4.
Gastric polyp and pyloric channel polyp biopsied at OSH, with pathology result showing tublar adenoma.
Required 1 unit of pRBC transfusion for Hct drop of ~ [**10-15**] points over the course of [**2-6**] days but no obvious melena or BRBPR.
# MSSA Bacteremia/hypotension: [**2-8**] Blood cultures on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] grew Methicillin Sensitive Staph Aureus.
Echocardiogram showed AR and MR, but there is no history of echocardiogram at PCP's office for comparison.
No blood culture was done in the OSH.
Anti-PF4 antibody was negative and platelet counts improved spontaneously.
Baseline creatinine 8.5.
PPD was placed and read as negative, and patient was set up for outpatient hemodialysis on M/W/F schedule in [**Hospital1 **].
Your blood counts have been stable.
You were transfused two units of blood after which your blood counts have been stable.
PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] M. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13553**]  Please also have your primary care physician set you up with a cardiologist after you are discharged.
You may have an area of narrowing with part of your fistula, so you will need a study called a fistulagram to further evaluate whether or not you will need a procedure to fix it.
