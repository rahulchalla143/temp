History of Present Illness: 76 yo female who underwent a cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 404**] [**2114**] (atherectomy and cypher stent to proximal LAD).
However the patient has refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (last chemotherapy was last week, diagnosed in [**Month (only) 596**]), PLT 31, and plavix and aspirin was stopped under the direction of her oncologist and cardiologist.
EKG showed inferior lead ischemia, Trop peaked at 3.58.
This AM EKG showed ST elevation in inferior leads.
On arrival to the floor, EKG showed juncional rhythm at 50, with 1-3mm ST elevation in II, III, avF with reciprocal changes in anterior leads.
Overnight, the patient's creatinine bumped to 3.1 from 1 and she was oliguric.
She was transferred to the CCU for a temporary pacer as it was thought that increasing her heart rate and subsequently her cardiac output, she would have greater perfusion to her kidneys and increased UOP.
Renital disease (detached retina which led to workup of blood problems) 7.
Physical Exam: VS: BP 100/50  HR 50  RR 16 98% 2L Gen: having chest pain, resting in bed, partly relieved by morphine HEENT: R pupil minimally reactive, L pupil reacts.
OP clear Neck: + JVD, no LAD Lungs: CLAB Heart: bradycardic, S1S2, no murmur, rub, gallop Abd: +BS, soft, ND/NT Extrem: no edema  Pertinent Results: OSH Labs: Wbc 4.4 Hgb 9.8 Hct 29.9 (transfused last week at [**Location (un) **]) Plt 31; Na 139; K+ 4.5; CL 109; CO2 26; BUN 24; creat 1.1; Trop 3.58 (up from 1.54) .
For this reason, a temporary screw-in pacer was placed with settings of VVI at a rate of 60.
c) Pump: EF of 50% with inferior hypokinesis and RV dysfunction on echo on [**8-8**].
The patient had little to no urine output after first being admitted, but during her hospitalization, her creatinine trended down and her urinary ouput increased.
Patient's electrolytes were monitored and corrected without incident.
#Renal cysts: Patient was found to have a new nodular component to renal cysts on u/s with recommendation to have an MRI to further evaluate these cysts.
to pursue an MRI as an outpatient.
