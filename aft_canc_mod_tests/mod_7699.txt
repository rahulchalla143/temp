The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-9-15**], the findings are similar.
[**2131-9-20**] CXR: Comparison is made to prior study from [**9-15**].
[**2131-9-29**] CXR:AP chest compared to [**2131-9-20**]: The lungs are fully expanded and clear.
Pathology: [**2131-9-14**] Bone Marrow: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) with expression of CD34, HLA-DR, CD10 (partial, dim), CD19, CD20 (partial dim), TDT and CD13 (small subset).
The review of the peripheral blood smear reveals a population of variably sized blasts with large nuclei with smooth chromatin, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and scant amount of basophilic cytoplasm.
Immunophenotypically, cells exhibit a typical pre-B cell phenotype, but are only partly (small subset) positive for CD10.
All metaphases showed the same abnormal clone.
Review of corresponding cytospin showed a paucicellular specimen with small mature lymphocytes and monocytes.
Pheresis and BMT were consulted, line was placed, and he was pheresed on admission, with improvement in WBC from 203K to 80K.
Uric acid was elevated and he was given rasburicase x1 given concern for tumor lysis syndrome with improvement in uric acid level.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed on morning after admission and flow cytometry was rushed.
TTE was suboptimal study but showed normal LVEF.
Good urine output was maintained with IVF.
Troponin trended up from <.01 to 0.03, next pending at time of transfer.
Echo suggests intact cardiac function, EF >55%.
Hct kept >26, given cardiac history and plts kept>10.
Hct and plts kept above 26 and 10 respectively.
CXR WNL.
# CAD: Echo suggests intact cardiac function, EF >55%.Statin and ASA held during admission due to interaction with chemo and thrombocytopenia.
Will need biopsy of nevi on back in the next 1-2 months when patient is more stable.
Transition Issues: Patient needs f/u with derm for biopsy of lesion on his back when plt count is sufficient (within 1-2months)  .
