[**2116-10-29**] EGD Impression: Grade 1 esophagitis in the lower third of the esophagus compatible with Esophagitis Polyp in the Stomach Body (biopsy) Normal mucosa in the stomach Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: These findings do not account for her possible bleeding Follow up biopsy results Please continue to monitor patient.
Ok to restart heparin for her MVR, but please monitor serial hct Please prep for colonoscoppy tomorrow with movi-prep .
[**10-30**] Colonoscopy Impression: Erythema in the Terminal ileum compatible with Terminal ileitis from ischemic, or infectious etiology Polyp at 65cm in the 65cm (ascending colon) Normal mucosa in the colon Internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Findings do not explain the patient's reported hematochezia.
Follow up biopsy results regarding her terminal ileitis Consider repeat colonoscopy in one year to evaluate the 6mm polyp as biopsies/polypectomy was not performed given the need to restart her heparin infusion for her MVR.
Biopsy [**2116-10-30**]: Terminal ileum, mucosal biopsy (A): Small intestinal mucosa with minimal superficial acute inflammation, otherwise within normal limits.
Biopsy [**2116-10-29**]: DIAGNOSIS: Stomach, polyp, procedure not specified: Hyperplastic polyp.
EGD and colonoscopy failed to reveal source of bleed and she was noted to not have bloody stools while we observed her.
She also presented with recent history of diarrhea and we found terminal ileitis which on biopsy showed mild, superficial inflammation.
For concern of acute bleed, she was transferred to the MICU where she underwent EGD and colonoscopy.
Colonoscopy showed internal hemmorhoids and terminal ileitis with a few small polyps and no source of potential significant bleed.
There was no active bleeding and a biopsy was taken of the terminal ileum which later showed minor superficial inflammation.
GI followed patient on the floor, and suggested sending Yersinia Ab's which were pending at time of discharge.
Her bloody stools did not recur on the floors, and she was having formed brown bowel movements at the time of discharge.
The GI team suggested possible MR enterography in the future if there is concern for Crohn's, but this is very low on the differential given her age of presentation.
Her Cr has trended downward to 1.1, but increased back to 1.4 on the day of discharge likely [**2-5**] additional dose of Torsemide on the day prior to discharge.
[**Hospital3 **] for MVR - Last echo done in [**2112**] demonstrated no MR and good prosthesis function and no MR murmur heard on exam.
Her INR was subtherapeutic at 1.4 in the ED.
Her urine cultures should be finalized by then (E. coli with sensitivities pending at time of discharge) and should be followed-up.
Discussed this with GI team, as this was not seen on prior CT scans 2 weeks prior.
She had no stigmata of cirrhosis, and the findings of this CT were thought to be not of significance.
Medication changes: As patient completes a 7-day course of Bactrim for UTI, her INR must be closely monitored with daily labs and coumadin dose-adjusted.

6. warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: daily at 4pm, to be adjusted based on INR goal 2.5-3.5.
DuoNeb 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Your blood levels were never significantly affected by this.
We did endoscopes of the upper and lower GI tract and found no source of bleed.
Our CT scan did show some inflammation of part of your small intestine, and we biopsied this during your colonoscopy.
The biopsy showed only mild inflammation.
They should recheck the PT/INR at your rehabilitation and adjust your dose based on your goal INR of 2.5-3.5.
