Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system  demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had diffuse proximal 80% stenosis involving the origin of a large D2, also with diffuse 70-80% disease.
Limited resting hemodyamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressures.

Troponins and CK-MB were cycled and also came back elevated.
Initial TTE showed mild regional LV and septal wall-motion abnormality and LVEF 40%.
Subsequent cardiac catherization showed The LAD had diffuse proximal 80% stenosis involving the origin of a large D2, also with diffuse 70-80% disease.
Subsequent TTE showed EF 50-55%, LVH, mild AR and mild MR.  Heparin drip was stopped 24h after catherization and patient was continued on ASA 325 and atorvastatin 80.
Likely developed in the setting of NSTEMI leading to diastolic dysfunction, which is one of the first signs of cardiac ischemia.
CXR is consistent with pulmonary edema.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], was given lasix 20mg IV, put out 500cc by transfer, but blood pressure droped to MAP 55.
Patient continued to be diuresed -2L the next day and his electrolytes were repleted.
CXR without evidence of pneumonia.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained as part of infectious work-up and were all no growth.
His blood pressure came back up by itself and by the time of discharge, he had been started on Toprol XL 50mg daily and Lisinopril 5mg daily and maintaining blood pressures within a good range.
Initial Chemistry glucoses were 190s-230s despite being NPO, but A1c was not elevated, so this could have been a stress response.
Transitional Issues: -Initial studies were obtained for cardiac surgery work-up.
Patient will follow-up on the results of these studies and schedule a time for surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
