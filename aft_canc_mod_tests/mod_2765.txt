Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, extensive pelvic adhesiolysis, pelvic and periaortic lymphadenectomy, omentectomy.
This imaging was then followed by a dedicated pelvic MR.
The MRI impression included in the differential diagnosis was an epithelial neoplasm of the ovary, versus an endometrioma with an associated malignancy.
A recent CA-125 was 11 on a scale of 0-35.
The MR enterography showed a 6 cm lower abdomen wide neck ventral hernia containing multiple loops of small bowel.

ECG [**2138-6-22**]: Regular SVT @ ~ 160 bpm.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit after total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, extensive pelvic adhesiolysis, pelvic and periaortic lymphadenectomy  omentectomy intubated for observation on [**2138-6-19**].
On the inpatient [**Hospital1 **] the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate up to 150s.
She received Lopressor 5 mg IV x 3 with decrease in her HRs to <100.
Cardiology was consulted for further management which recommended continuing Lisinopril 20mg daily, initiating Lopressor 25mg three times daily, Aspirin 325mg daily, Echocardiogram which showed LVEF >55%, no aortic regurgitation, mitral mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no pericardial effusion, control of surgical pain, hold Dyazide diuretic, continue statin, and check TSH which was normal at 2.5mg.
A CTA was obtained [**2138-6-26**] which showed Bilateral pulmonary emboli with new linear atelectasis in the lower lobes and small dependent fluid postoperative collection surrounding the spleen.
The patient was a started on intravenous Heparin and Warfarin therapy was initiated with the INR goal of [**2-12**].
The patient was monitored with daily INR values and dosed with 5 mg of Warfarin.
On discharge the patient's INR was 2.4 and she was discharged on 4mg of Warfarin daily with follow up with her primary care provider on Thursday [**2138-7-3**] for INR check and dose adjustment.
