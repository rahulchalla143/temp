In short, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a history of hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis who was found to have a 5 cm mass on CT scan in [**9-/2186**] which was shown to be expanding in [**10/2187**] to 9x6 cm with multiple pulmonary nodules.
AFP levels were greater than 600,000 ng/ml.
Further imaging in [**2-/2188**], however, failed to show a mass and AFP had then decreased to 2177 ng/ml.
When hospitalized in [**3-/2188**] for an UGI bleed he was found to have a right atrial mass on echocardiogram, confirmed to be HCC on biopsy in [**2188-4-17**].
Past Medical History: # HCC - has a history of hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by grade II-III varices - initial surveillance CT performed at an outside hospital in [**9-/2186**] showed a 5-cm mass in the left liver as well as multiple satellite lesions.
AFP on [**2187-11-14**] was greater than 100,000 ng/mL.
- at [**Hospital1 18**] CT on [**2187-12-6**] showed a 9 x 6 cm enhancing mass in the left liver as well as innumerable pulmonary nodules, the largest measuring  9-10 mm.
AFP was >600,000ng/mL.
However, further imaging showed improved in infiltrating liver process and AFP decreased to 2177ng/mL on [**2188-2-25**].
- He was hospitalized in [**3-/2188**] with upper GI bleed, and echocardiogram during that hospitalization diagnosed a right atrial mass.

**FINAL REPORT [**2189-3-30**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2189-3-30**]):       CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.
Arrangements for cardiac catheterization and carotid duplex ultrasound on [**2189-3-12**] were made prior to his operation on [**2189-3-13**].
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated the following:  No angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary disease.
Carotid duplex demonstrated less than 40% stenosis in the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
He underwent exploratory laparotomy, mobilization of the liver, mobilization of inferior vena cava, inflow occlusion.
On [**3-14**], a liver duplex was done noting the following: Poor evaluation of the left hepatic vein, and residual tumor in this area cannot be excluded.
A TTE was then done noting EF of >55% and no residual right atrial mass seen.
Repeat liver duplex on [**3-19**] was performed again demonstrating the following: 1.
Given the liver duplex findings, a CT was performed to evaluate the hepatic vasculature.
CT on [**3-20**] showed interval right atrial and IVC tumor thrombectomy with persistent pulmonary emboli, persistent middle and left hepatic venous occlusion, unchanged from [**2189-3-5**] CT. No definite focal lesions were seen in the liver.
INR became therapeutic on [**3-24**] with inr 2.4.
A diagnostic paracentesis was performed.
Fluid was sent for gram stain, cell count and culture.
Vital signs were stable.
Weight was up one kg as well.
Coumadin INR goal is [**2-19**].
Goal INR [**2-19**]  15.
