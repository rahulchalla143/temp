His blood pressure was stable but on the low side for him, around 100/70's.
K.  He was given 2 units packed RBC's (crit was 28.2) and his Hct remained stable without further bleeding.
For the remainder of the hospital  he had no bleeding and his HCT was stable.
An esophageal ultrasound showed that his stage was T2 with possible involvement of lymph nodes.
A CT scan did not show any evidence of metastases.
[**Name (NI) 54041**] Pt with MVR in [**10-30**].
After the EGD he was started on heparin and the PTT was maintained between 60-80 as per cardiology recommendations.
4.HTN- Mr. [**Known lastname 48753**] blood pressure meds were initially held because of bleeding and low BP.
After he was stabilized and not bleeding his blood pressure was monitored.
The beta blocker was added once his BP returned to the 120's/80's and slowly increased to his normal dose of metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Pulmonary- On CT the patient was found to have evidence of interstitial pneumonitis.
PFT's were done which exhibited a restrictive picture.
