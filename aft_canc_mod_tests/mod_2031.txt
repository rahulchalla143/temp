WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2142-12-1**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.

Hypoxia, new b/l infiltrates on CXR suggesting fungal infection.
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT imaging of the chest without and with intravenous contrast.
Comparison made to CT of the chest from [**2142-9-5**].
A 5.3 x 3.5 cm (5:37) rim-enhancing fluid collection along the anterior medial margin of the right chest abuts pleura and pericardium and crosses the plane of the minor fissure, adjacent to a previous pneumonia; whether is a lung or pleural abscess is uncertain.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
_ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ [**2142-12-19**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2066-12-10**], and 31:  Right pleural effusion has almost disappeared since [**12-15**].
Given patient's recent history of rapid waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] of asymmetric pulmonary edema, this may represent recurrence of edema alone, but since there has been five-day interval since the last chest film, the rapidity of onset is really indeterminate and pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2142-12-18**]):       >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.
A sample of tissue was sent to pathology and microbiology and showed oropharyngeal flora, small amount of yeast, and small amount of fungal spores.
#)Pulmonary infection - CT scan, xrays w/ right sided effusion, bilateral ground glass opacities most consistent with CHF.
Biopsy of R chest wall collection unrevealing but micro specimen misplaced was misplaced.
Tapped R sided pleural effusion and sent for culture and cytology which were both negative.
Reaccumulated on [**12-10**] and repeat CT w/ re-accum of effusion and persistent infiltrates.
Repeat echo was unchanged.
