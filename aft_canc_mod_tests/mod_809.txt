Workup by his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 7837**] "abnormal immunoglobulin levles, further evaluated with bone marrow biopsy revealing MGUS.
Biopsy of plaques on the dorum of his knuckles were suggestive of Gottren's papules, making diagnosis concerning for dermatomyositis.
Furthermore, as dermatomyositis was raised, patient underwent an exhausive workup for malignancy including colonsocopy and endoscopy.
Sputum cultures grew MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
At time of discharge he was satting in the low 90s on room air with ambulatory sats in the mid-90s on room air.
Of note, skin biopsy recently showed overlap between lichen planus and connective tissue disorder (lichen planus with immune  deposition).
Serologic tests include: negative [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, anti-synthetase antibodies and normal CK.
In the ED, initial vital signs were 98.7 102 101/60 22.
CXR from earlier in the day was clear.
Vital sings on tranfer were: 112/75, 101, 90% 4L nc.

CT Abd: 1.
[**Country 7018**] red stains are negative for amyloid, with satisfactory control.
Thyroid US [**2171-2-27**]: 11 mm spongy nodule in the left thyroid without worrisome features.
, EKG [**2171-3-4**]: Sinus tachycardia with increase in rate as compared with previoui tracing of [**2171-2-23**].
CTA [**2171-3-4**]: 1.
CXR [**2171-3-6**]: Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.
Right lower lobe and left lower lobe bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening and endobronchial impaction overall appear unchanged since the prior examination with no evidence of interval progression of the infectious process.
CXR [**2171-3-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2171-3-13**]: Bronchial wall thickening or peribronchial infiltration in the lower lungs where most pronounced bronchiectasis is have worsened since [**3-11**] consistent either with a flare of bronchiectasis or development of peribronchial pneumonia.
CXR [**2171-3-14**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
CXR [**2171-3-17**]: 1) Small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Repeat CT at that time suggested no abscess but RLL nodular densities concerning for spread of infx (aspergillosis or fungal) vs inflammatory nodules.
Pulm also suggested an acapella flutter device, [**Doctor First Name **] nebs 3x/wk (started [**3-2**]), and blood testing for CF.
A CXR at that time demonstrated a new RLL PNA.
On [**3-13**] a CXR performed in the setting of persistent tachycardia demonstrated a flare of his bronchiectasis vs a peri-bronchial PNA.
On [**2171-3-17**], respiratory status worsened with tachypnea, venous blood gas showed increased CO2.
CXR showed LLL opacification/collapse.
His multiple skin  biopsies are consistent with an exuberant lichen-planus like eruption, which for the moment we are categorizing as severe generalized lichen planus.
Our work up for  paraneoplastic syndrome, namely the LP varient of PAMS, has thus far been negative: no Dsg1 or Dsg3 antibodies, and indirect immunoflouresence has been negative (although immunoflouresence on rat bladder is still pending - will be run by [**Hospital1 **]).
BM bx suggested possible mastocytosis, but derm felt that skin biopsies were less consistent with this possibility, and a tryptase was negative.
Based on a discussion between heme/onc and derm, the pt underwent a 4-day course of IVIG 0.5 g/kg/day (25g/day) under the premise that though this is not a treatment for lichen planus per se it might target the underlying pathology.
# Bacteremia: Grew out MSSA from blood cultures 2/03 in the setting of persistent fevers.
Blood cx grew GPC in clusters until [**2-26**] (last positive cx [**2-25**]).
ID followed, but signed off [**3-1**] (note: pt should f/u with [**Doctor Last Name 13895**] of ID w/in 2 wks of d/c; need to fax labs qweek to ID dept).
Pt had poor quality TTE that did not reveal vegetations but a TEE was deferred given aspiration risk and pt preference.
Daily surveillence cultures were obtaiend [**Date range (1) 19594**].
Cultures remained negative and patient was afebrile.
On [**3-13**] an infectious workup for tachycardia yielded blood cultures that grew MRSA, and on [**3-14**] he was broadened to cefepime/linezolid.
# Nutrition/deconditioning: Pt's weight down to ~115 from pre-illness weight 170.
An oral video swallow previously showed no change from prior.
TF to 90/hr x 12 hrs (9PM-9AM) on [**2-27**] (~1620 cals); pt tolerating well.
In follow up appointment he was noted to have LFTs with ALT 627, AST 276, Alk Phos 198, TBili 0.5.
Vital hepatitidies, CMV, EBV, VZV, HSV with negative serologies and/or viral loads.
He underwent liver biopsy which was suggestive of drug induced immune reaction vs autoimmune hepatitis.
The hepatology team also recommended further workup with antiLKM ab, serum VEGF levels to r/o POEMS, which were all unrevealing.
By the first week of [**Month (only) 956**] his LFTs had more or less stabilized at ALT 200s, AST ~100, AlkPhos ~200.
Urine lytes [**3-2**] indicate SIADH (UOsm 799).
# Thyroid nodule: 1.1 cm thyroid nodule discovered incidentally on chest CT on [**2-22**].
Thyroid U/S performed [**2-27**]; nodule not concerning; defer further w/u for now.
Given other hemotologic abnormalities repeat bone marrow biopsy may be indicated.
