CT of the abd/pelvis did not reveal a source but did reveal some bony lytic lesions in the right ischium and bilateral ilia concerning for metastatic disease.
Bedside [**Month/Day (4) 113**] showing large pericardial effusion.
Past Medical History: - Tuberculosis treated in [**2145**] with normal chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2162**].
- normal colonoscopy 2/[**2178**].
Pertinent Results: EKG [**5-30**]: sinus tachy at 118 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no ST-T changes, normal voltage.
Admission Labs: K:4.3 PT: 12.4  PTT: 23.9  INR: 1.1 135  104  8 -------------< 128 4.3  25  0.8 CK: 102  MB: 1  Trop-T: <0.01 LDH 805 TProt: 6.9 .
CXR [**5-30**]: Single AP chest radiograph demonstrate hazy opacity within the right lung base likely representing atelectasis vs air space disease.
RV diastolic collapse, c/w impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Emergency study performed by the cardiology fellow on call .
Repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] [**6-4**]:Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-6-2**], there is probably no signficant change.
Colonoscopy [**6-5**]: No masses or polyps seen.
An [**Month/Year (2) 113**] on [**6-1**] showed partial resolution of part of the pericardial effusion, but persistance of a loculated effusion.
It was felt that the drain should be pulled and an [**Month/Year (2) 113**] repeated on [**6-2**] showed no progression.
Endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed without evidence of malignancy.
# DVT - large VTE in common femoral artery extending to IVC found on CT scan.
We reviewed recent CT scan and decided to place an IVC filter on day of admission to help prevent spread of DVT into the pulm vasculator.
The risks/benefits of anticoagulation were considered and we opted to start heparin gtt with close monitoring of her hemodynamics and pericardial output.
Her oxygen requirement did not increase but she remained mildly tachycardic.
# Right buttock pain: patient with lytic lesions found on CT scan thought likely malignant.
AP pelvis negative for fracture.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-12**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed for nasal dryness.
Further studies were performed to evaluate for the source of malignancy.
On evaluation it was found that you have a DVT and you were started on Lovenox.
