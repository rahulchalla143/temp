Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
She was unable to lie supine, so she was intubated for CT scan due to concern for occult bleed as cause for Hct drop.
[**3-18**] she was reintubated due to hypoxemia believed to be due to upper airway edema as seen on bronchoscopy which improved w/ methylprednisolone.
Her respiratory failure was likely [**3-20**] her long standing diastolic CHF, COPD exacerbation, and pneumonia.
