At OSH, pt was noted to have: WBC 3.6 (Blast=3, Myelocyte 2, Metamyelo=4, Band=6), Hct 25.5 (nucleated RBC=23), Plt 73.
Chem-7 was notable for a BUN/creat of 67/2.5.
Alb = 2.1.
TProt = 6.0, TBili 1.0, AP=110, ALT 254, AST 327, CK 938, TropI <0.04.
BNP was 1300 and pt was given lasix 40 IV x1.
When pt was found to have "blast" immature forms on periph smear, pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further therapy.

-ABG: 7.43 | 35 | 60 on 5L NC -UA: trace blood, otherwise negative -CXR: (prelim): no infiltrates but L-heart border somewhat indistinct; slight volume overload; possible pleural effusion on lateral film   Brief Hospital Course: During [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, pt was initially on 95% face mask, which was titrated to 5L NC.
However, echo and MUGA showed EF 61% with moderate pulm art systolic htn.
Serial CXR showed improvement in bilateral pleural effusions.
CXR did not show any evidence of pneumonia; there was no clinical evidence of pneumonia.
Pt had evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension on echo, which may be secondary to left heart failure (perhaps diastolic, since the echo showed preserved EF).
However, given the pt's body habitus, we would recommend an outpatient sleep study to look for OSA.
Heme/Onc - After serial cbc/differential, it was felt that pt has MDS with blasts secondary to reactive marrow.
Pt has 15% blasts on his bone marrow biopsy, which does not quality for acute leukemia.
Pt should have his MDS and blast count closely followed by an outpatient hematology/oncologist to look for acute leukemic transformation.
CK peaked at 1525.
CK normalized with IV hydration.
