On this contrast-enhanced study it does not appear that there is acute hemorrhage into the wall of the aorta within the descending thoracic aneurysm.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.
The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and right adrenal gland are unremarkable.
The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, and intrapelvic loops of small and large bowel are normal in appearance and caliber.
CT REFORMATS: Coronal, sagittal, volume rendered images were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology of this case.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Hemodynamic assessment was limited and showed normal aortic systemic  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 79 year old gentleman who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and was found to have a contained rupture of ascending and descending components of a large saccular thoracic aortic aneurysm.
He was admitted to the cardiac surgery service in the intensive care unit shortly after his presentation where central venous access was placed and the patient was started on Nipride and Esmolol for blood pressure control.
He was transfused with 2 units of blood with an appropriate rise in hematocrit and was hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital course.
On hospital day 2 he underwent cardiac catheterization in preparation for surgery and was found to have significant multi-vessel disease.
He was then transferred to the intensive care unit with lopressor for blood pressure control.
Good pain control   Discharge Instructions: You may resume your preadmission medications in addition to the medications we have given you-- please note that we have increased the dosage of Lopressor, your blood pressure medication.
