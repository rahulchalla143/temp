In the ED, T 98.4 (rectal), HR 101, BP 102/53, RR 20, O2Sat 98% on 3L.
On the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib with RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as respiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.
--CT [**8-23**]: Progression, treated with Cytoxan, Velban and Prednisone with a good response --Eroding mass at sacrum, treated with radiation therapy --[**3-/2191**]: Severe hypoxemia, somnolence, and generalized edema, with anasarca responsive to diuresis and oxygen supplements, and discharged on constant oxygen --[**3-/2191**]: CVVP trial, stopped in [**10-28**] because of low blood counts --Low-dose modified regimen: Chlorambucil 4mg daily for days [**1-27**], Procarbazine 50mg daily for days [**1-27**], Velban 10 mg IV on day 1 only, Neulasta 6mg on day 8.
--[**9-/2192**]: Chemotherapy discontinued given poor response --[**1-/2193**]: L sided chest pain with lytic lesions in the thoracic vertebrae; received radiation therapy to T6-T8 including the right 7th rib --CT [**8-/2193**]: Interval decrease in vertebral lesions.
VITALS: T 98.8 Rectal HR 79 BP 104/67 RR 15 SAT 97%4L NC HEENT: Sclera anicteric.
crackle at bases, though difficult to assess b/c patient not cooperative during the exam CV: RR, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: warm, + anasarca with involvement of upper limbs SKIN: no rashes, no jaundice NEURO: somewhat somnolent.
Difficult to complete full neuro exam given somnolence  Pertinent Results: [**1-8**] - CXR - IMPRESSION: Persistent right-sided effusion.
Routine PA and lateral films are recommended for evaluation when feasible.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.
Was transfused total of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**]) with a transfusion threshold of 10.
Will continue to trend platelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.
Also, the patient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total of four units since [**2194-1-12**]).
# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having hypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to fluid blosues of 250 cc.
ECHO demonstrated impaired LV relaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for distributive shock.
Vanc and piptaz started on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not obtainable at this point.
Head CT negative for acute process.
Thyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick euthyroid syndrome.
Later in her hospital course, the patient was hypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought secondary to ATN.
Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were positive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime x10 days.
Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast, which was not treated.
Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew out yeast.
# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right acetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.
Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**], unchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.
