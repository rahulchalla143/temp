Serum calcium was noted to be 15.1 on [**7-28**] and patient was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He also had labs, UA, EKG, CXR, and head CT w/o contrast.
Head CT showed a 17 mm low density area in the right lentiform nucleus, c/w prior hemorrhage vs old CVA.
CXR (-), U/A w/ hematuria (Foley) but no evidence of infection.
Given h/o EtOH abuse, he had an abd U/S to evaluate for ascites.
Subsequent Abd CT showed that this mass was erroding into bone; also noted was a LLE DVT.
The sentinal lymph node was negative for metastatic disease.
Baseline Cr 1.1-1.3.
There was no ascites so SBP was unlikely.
Lumbar puncture was attempted twice without success, therefore meningitis could not be ruled out.
4) Septic shock: He initially required Levophed to maintain his blood pressure and it was weaned off by hospital day 4.
The pelvic fluid collection was drained and was sterile, so this was not likely the cause of his sepsis.
9) Anemia: His hematocrit was low.
Otherwise, his hematocrit remained stable throughout the admission.
An EEG showed slow wave focus suggesting fixed subcortical abnormality in left hemicortex, possible subclinical seizure activity, and he was loaded with phenytoin.
Abdominal films were negative for obstruction.
CXR showed no acute pulmonary and a PPD was negative.
His creatinine improved upon resolution of the sepsis.
