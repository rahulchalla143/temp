* In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be hypotensive with SBP in 80s (baseline SBP 120s).
His hct was found to be 33.6 and INR of 1.5.
* In the ICU, pt was weaned off dopamine and his BP remained stable in the 100s/50s.
Other causes of hypotension such as adrenal insufficiency and sepsis needed to be ruled out so a cortisol level and blood cx were sent.
Hct dropped gradually from 36.5 on day of admission to 29.6 the following day.
A CT of the abd/pelvis was done and found no evidence of a retroperitoneal bleed.

Also has liver dx and MDS, so has chronically low platelets, and not surprised that PT and PTT are somewhat elevated.
Had a Hct drop after admit, but unclear if dilutional in part.
Had abd/pelvis CT which showed no RP bleed.
Also, had cortisol which was normal and didn't indicate adrenal insuff.
His BP was stable for entire time on floor, and his nadolol was restarted, but at a lower dose.
