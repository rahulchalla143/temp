Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).
Blood/Urine Cultures from [**6-22**]: Pending, NGTD  CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**6-21**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head [**6-21**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Consider MRI for further assessment.
CXR [**6-21**]: IMPRESSION: ET tube in satisfactory position, with very low lung volumes.
Plan was for urgent LP/MRI/EEG but work-up was interrupted by request of family and primary oncologist to have transfer to [**Hospital3 328**] for further care.
EEG was performed and demonstrated no focal seizure activity with moderate global encephalopathy c/w toxic/metabolic process.
- MRI/MRA/MRV w/&w/o contrast brain when able.
- Check peripheral smear for evaluation of TTP.
CT scan of the chest demonstates left lower lobe consolidation.
Blood cultures from admission growing 4/4 bottles of gram positive cocci in pairs/chains - likely strep pneumo.
- mild sedation - wean qAM - sputum cultures .
- mild sedation - monitor on tele .
- Lesion on CT unlikely seizure focus as per neurology - MRA/MRV/EEG - consider LP for infection, toxic-metabolic w/up .
- consider surgical eval - serial abd exams - follow lactate .
Appears euvolemic on exam so would continue to monitor HR, UOP.
Urine lytes c/w pre-renal.
