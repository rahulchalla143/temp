He was given Vancomycin 1 gm IV X1 and transferred to [**Location (un) **] ED where BP 88/57.
A CXR was consistent with CHF, with BNP 1090 and patient was given Lasix 80 mg IV X1.
He was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care, where BP initially 70/40 on 5 mcg/kg/min of dopamine.
In the ED, blood cultures were sent.
A bedside echo was performed and showed no pericardial effusion.
DM type 2 on Prandin 3.
Cryptogenic cirrhosis diagnosed by biopsy 6.
Chronic renal insufficiency with [**Year (4 digits) 5348**] creatinine 2.0 7.
Remote ex-smoker, with 10 pack-year smoking history.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is probably moderate aortic valve stenosis (recommend transthoracic echo for complete evaluation of the aortic stenosis if clinically indicated).
A bedside echo on admission showed relatively preserved EF, no pleural effusion.
It was unclear whether his fever/hypotension were related to persistent enterococcal infection or a new nosocomial infection.
CXR was without PNA and U/A clear.
All cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] were unremarkable.
A repeat TEE was performed on [**2113-1-16**], which revealed normal LVEF 60-65%, and no vegetation although a sessile vegetation could not be ruled out given severe calcification of aortic valve.
An abdominal U/S was also performed, which revealed a small amount of ascites and no fluid collection.
Will need Gentamicin levels every 4th day (goal peak=3, trough=1).
Hold Gentamicin if creatinine >2.5.
CXRs in hospital revealed progressive fluid overload, and Lasix dose was titrated up to maintain negative fluid balance.
[**Date Range **] weight 140lbs.
Low threshold to increase Lasix if increasing edema on exam, or >=3lbs weight gain as creatinine tolerates.
EKG without acute ischemic changes.
Patient also continued on Coumadin, with goal INR [**2-16**].
INR 2.0 Will need close monitoring at rehab.
While in hospital, patient transfused a total of 3 units of PRBCs to maintain Hct >30 given known CAD.
Platelets stable in low 100K, and WBC around [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] of 3.
Gentamicin levels monitored carefully in hospital given risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
Patient will need Gentamicin levels q 4 days, with goal peak=3 and trough=1.
Plan to D/C Gentamicin if creatinine >=2.5.
Of note, patient noted to have mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and GGT in hospital, also elevated at OSH.
Abdominal U/S at OSH negative for CBD dilatation, no GB wall thickening, no pericholecystic fluid.
Citalopram Hydrobromide 20 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Warfarin Sodium 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): Please monitor daily INR until stable.
Please check Gentamicin levels every 4th day (every 2 doses).
