In the ED, he was found to be hypotensive to the 80's with a temp of 103.8 degrees rectally.
He was given 500 mg flagyl IV and blood cultures were sent.
O2 sat dropped to 77% and the decision was made by his son in the room to reverse his DNR/DNI status to intubate him.
His blood pressure fell to SBP 70's and dopamine was started, but this was changed to levophed after it was not found to be effective.
His SBP's remained in the 70's but then gradually increased after fluid resissitation with 2L of fluid and titrating up levophed.
