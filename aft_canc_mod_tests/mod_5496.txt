Head CT was read as unremarkable.
CT of the abdomen showed a splenic laceration.
He received IV contrast after the head CT for the abdominal CT.
Here, a CT scan was repeated which showed a question of a basilar artery hyperdensity over the pons (but this was post-contrast).
On review of prior CT at OSH before contrast, this area is somewhat motion degraded but does appear slightly bright.
The admitting trauma team called their attending who told them he did not want to pursue thrombolysis no matter what the concern for basilar thrombosis given the high possibility that he would bleed from his spleen which could be fatal.
Next, the pt had received a CT contrast load several hours earlier and has a Cr=1.2.
A discussion was held and in the end, the pt was slotted to get an urgent partial MRI DWI and MRA to answer the question of whether the basilar was truly occluded.
This would only add ~10 minutes to the process as the CT scanner was in use by a trauma patient.
The patient's exam was suggestive of a right-sided stroke, but he had a significant left neglect.
Neck: No Carotid bruits CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Ext:No cyanosis/edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake and alert, somewhat cooperative with exam.

MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA demonstrates occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery near the bifurcation.
Since the MRA is somewhat limited by motion, further evaluation of the left carotid can be obtained with CT angiography if clinically indicated.
The CT angiography can also help for further evaluation of great vessels of the thoracic outlet which are not visualized on the MRA.
No evidence of acute dissection on the fat-suppressed axial images of the neck and MRA of the neck.
MRI CERVICAL SPINE No evidence of ligamentous disruption seen.
CT OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: T1 through T12 are visualized.
Wedge compression fracture of T12 may be acute.
Incompletely imaged on this spine CT is [**Hospital1 **]-apical consolidation, worse on the right.
CT OF THE LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are six non-rib-bearing lumbar vertebral bodies.
Neurologic examination on admission was notable for left facial droop and left sided hemiplegia.
MRI of the brain on admission demonstrated acute right MCA infarct.
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] showed occlusion of M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery.
MRA of the neck vessels with fat sats demonstrated no evidence of dissection, but did demonstrate somewhat tortuous but normal vertebrals and right internal carotid arteries.
TTE revealed no evidence of thrombus or focal hypokinesis.
T12 compression fracture: Trauma work-up after the MVA demonstrated T12 compression fracture.
Discussion with the pt's oncologist and radiation oncologist revealed that this lesion had actually been receiving palliative radiation therapy, so likely represented a pathologic fracture.
