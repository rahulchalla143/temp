Lumbar puncture   History of Present Illness: 64yo right handed man with PMH significant for HTN, DMII, HCV, and recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for ataxia presents from [**Hospital3 **] with altered consciousness.
An EVD was placed at the bedside.
At the time, an MRI showed two frontal lesions, one which was thought to be secondary to hemorrhage, one thought to be secondary to infarction.
His mental status was noted to be declining, now only responding to painful stimuli with occasional spontaneous eye opening.
LP was done [**9-12**] and showed 4+ PMNs on gram stain, no organizms.
Physical Exam: PE: VS: BP 180/76, HR 65, RR 17, SaO2 100%/FM Genl: lying in bed, not moving HEENT: NCAT, MMM, facemask in place CV: RRR, nl S1, S2 Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly Abd: soft, ND, BS+ Ext: warm & dry .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2136-9-26**] 4:15 PM Again seen is a right medial frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema with expected evolution of blood products.
Evolution of blood products with persistent vasogenic edema in both cerebral hemispheres as described above.
EEG ([**9-11**]): This is an abnormal EEG due to the unreactive, slow and disorganized background activity.
[**2136-9-11**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 1.
[**2136-9-11**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Tip of the endotracheal tube is in standard placement, approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.
[**2136-9-10**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): 1.
[**2136-9-9**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Pulmonary vascular congestion, increased since prior examination.
[**2136-9-5**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 1.
[**2136-9-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Mediastinal and pulmonary venous congestion are new, and mild cardiomegaly has worsened, consistent with cardiac decompensation and/or volume overload.
[**2136-9-4**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 1.
[**2136-9-4**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 1.
CXR ([**9-3**])- The lungs remain clear of focal consolidation and the lateral costophrenic sulci are sharply marginated.
CT head ([**9-3**])- New hemorrhage along the catheter tract, extending into the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
However, compared to the head CT of [**2136-8-30**], there has been no change.
Since the head CT of [**2136-8-30**], there has been development of a moderate-to-large left subgaleal hematoma.
CT head ([**8-30**])- Large right parenchymal hemorrhage with blood dissecting into the ventricles, with associated hydrocephalus.
An EVD was immediately placed, and the patient admitted to the Neurosurgery service to the ICU.
He remained in the ICU on this day for blood pressure control.
On POD4 he had a head CT which showed improvement in the IVH.
# Fever w/ Declining Mental Status: Pt's MS began to decline while fevers began, w/o significant change in CT scans of head.
WBC was normal at transfer.
Differential included: 1.
Seizure - Pt was started on oxycarbamazapine and Keppra, and EEG was ordered to r/o possibility of subclinical seizures, but results were suggestive of global encephalopathy (repeated [**9-11**] w/o significant change).
Increased ICP - Neurosurgery was consulted for possible IC cath blockage (possible ALOC due to increased ICP), but ICP was unremarkable; EVD was discontinued on [**9-5**], and neurosurgery signed-off w/o ability to explain declining MS.  Pt also received a f/u CT head on [**9-11**] with improved ICH and no signs of increased ICP.
LPs produced CSF for analysis on [**9-2**] and [**9-12**]; the [**9-2**] sample failed to reveal a pathogen and revealed only 1+ PMNs; the [**9-12**] CSF was significant for 4+ PMNs but failed to reveal an insulting pathogen.
Hepatic Encephalopahty - given HCV cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy was investigated.
Ultimately, pt's mental status showed a mild improvement throughout the course of his MICU stay, with pt able to track examiners with his eyes when on his right; pt was still ignoring his left side upon transfer to floor; movement of right arm was noted, no other motor activity was appreciated.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr reached a maximum of 3.8 vs. 2.0 at baseline and at admission.
Renal consultation and testing concluded that acute on chronic renal failure was secondary to septic ATN with possible acyclovir toxicity (given appearance of acyclovir crystals in urine).
# Hepatitis w/ Pancreatitis - LFTs and amylase/lipase were noted to be elevated in an obstructive pattern on [**9-19**]; RUQ U/S failed to reveal cholelithiasis or CBD dilation; CPK was assayed, and was elevated, which in the context of elevated LFTs and pancreatic enzymes, was highly suggestive of statin toxicity.
# Hypertension:  Initially very difficult to control on multiple medications, including nicardipine gtt as needed to keep SBP < 160.
Ultimately, pt's BP began to stabilize, nicardipine drip was discontinued [**9-14**]; from there, BP was well-controlled on amlodipine, hydral, labetalol, and isordil.
HCT remained relatively stable post-transfusion as pt was transferred to the floor.
INR normal but low albumin, so likely some synthetic dysfunction.
Liver biopsy in [**5-31**] with Stage 4 fibrosis.
CT head with no evidence of new bleed.
To follow dilantin levels and Ativan as needed by rehabilitation center with close monitoring and neuro follow- up.
Colonoscopy with evidence of large sessile polyp in transverse colon and sigmoid colon.
DDAVP given, in the setting of possible uremic bleeding.
Polypectomy performed at colonoscopy [**9-27**] with guiac negative stools subsequently.
WBC remained in the 11.0 range.
#Htn- BP to highest SBP 195, patient had not received calcium channel blocker during episodes of lower GI bleed.
Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine at 2.
Current creatinine at discharge 1.4. .
Pt discharged to rehabilitation facility with follow up with renal, neuro, in addition to repeat colonoscopy in 6 months.
