He received cycle 1 of TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-FU) on [**2155-9-8**].
CT of neck and chest [**9-24**] showed significant improvement in disease burden and degree of airway narrowing.

[**2155-11-8**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Tracheostomy is in place.
Otherwise, no significant change compared with [**2155-11-7**] at 8:18 a.m.  [**2155-11-7**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) In comparison with study of [**11-6**], there is little overall change.
[**2155-11-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube has been removed and replaced with a tracheostomy tube.
Right basal and left retrocardiac opacities can be also appreciated on the chest CT obtained on [**2155-11-4**] and are concerning for multifocal infection.
[**2155-11-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Previous pulmonary edema on [**11-3**] has improved, but there is multifocal infection, demonstrated to better advantage on yesterday's chest CT scan concerning for pneumonia, with demonstration of heavy retained secretions in the airways, particularly the bronchus to the collapsed left lower lobe.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are more obvious on the CT scan.
[**2155-11-4**] CT NECK W/CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1.
Infiltrative tumor in the post-cricoid region involving the right hypopharynx, incompletely assessed in this CT study but appearing smaller compared to the recent study.
[**2155-11-4**] CT CHEST W/CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2155-11-4**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1.
Please note MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of intracranial metastasis.
LINE PLACEM: AP semi-upright chest radiograph was obtained.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-9-29**], the pericardial effusion is now smaller than it was in the last transthoracic echocardiogram and right ventricular free wall motion now appears slightly less vigorous.
[**2155-11-3**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IMPRESSION: 1.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2155-10-10**] Q-T interval seems normal.
On evaluation, he was not stridulous and his airways were patent on laryngoscopic evaluation.
ABG showed slight hypercarbia but sufficient oxygenation.
CT chest showed heavy bronchial secretions occluding the left lower lobe bronchus and severely narrow the left upper.
CXR suggested possible infiltrate on admission and CT chest confirmed multifocal consolidations.
Blood cultures sent from [**Hospital1 1319**] grew MRSA and MRSA later grew in endotrachial sputum cultures.
Blood cultures were sent on [**11-11**] after completing course of antibiotics, and these surveillance cultures should be followed to determine of there is a need to restart a longer course of vancomycin.
He was also continued on fluconazole for fungal pericarditis (below), which will also cover for possible fungal laryngitis appreciated on ENT laryngoscopic exam (should continue taking through [**2155-11-26**]).
CT head revealed stable right frontal encephalomalacia from prior stroke.
EEG was performed on previous admission which revealed generalized slowing, but no seizure activity.
He restarted XRT at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-11**] and received a total of 2 doses (#15 and #16 out of 30).
# Fungal pericarditis: Pleural effusion and pericardial tissue, but not pericardial effusion cultures from [**2155-9-29**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] sensitive to fluconazole.
Repeat TTE here showed findings consistent with constriction but only mild pericardial effusion.
# MRSA bacteremia: Positive blood cultures at [**Hospital3 **], growing MRSA in 1 out of 4 bottles.
TTE was negative for vegetations and TEE deferred given low concern for endocarditis and negative surveillance cultures here.
Surveillance blood cultures were drawn after stopping antibiotics and were pending at the time of discharge with no growth to date.
His counts trended down slowly requiring transfusion of 2 units pRBCs and 2 units of platelets during his admission.
His hematocrit on discharge was 26 and platelets were 28.
# Coagulopathy: INR 1.5 on admission, possibly [**3-6**] poor nutrition vs. recent abx.
He was given a dose of Vitamin K and his INR improved slightly to 1.3 and remained stable throughout hospitalization without evidence of active bleeding.
# Hyponatremia: Patient's sodium dropped from 137 to 126 during admission.
Thought to be SIADH (from malignancy vs. pain with humerus fracture vs. recent tracheostomy) given that he was euvolemic on exam with good urine output, low serum osms, high urine osms, high urine sodium and improvement with free water restriction.
Transitional care: - CODE: FULL - Contact: Daughter [**Name (NI) **] (HCP), Sister [**Doctor First Name **] - Patient should continue fluconazole for fungal pericarditis and possible fungal laryngitis through [**2155-11-26**] - Multiple surveillance blood cultures pending at discharge - Please have speech and swallow evaluate for Passey Muir Valve   Medications on Admission: Preadmissions medications listed are complete and require futher investigation.
