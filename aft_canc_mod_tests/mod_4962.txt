Echo [**2162-5-25**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-5-13**], the left ventricular systolic function is less vigorous, but still normal.
Will follow-up with surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**], to asses his progress and repeat CT - details on Page 1.
# Pulmomary Embolus: Pt was diagnosed with PE on CT scan which showed probable PE versus motion artifact:  LENIs were negative.
Repeat chest CTA  done on [**5-17**] did not show a PE, however this was difficult to interpret since he was already treated for 7 days with lovenox and clot might have been absorbed.
He will need to continue lovenox until he is therapeutic in INR (goal [**12-30**]) for at least 48 hours.
Pt was briefly treated with micafungin for 6 days for + B-galactamanan, but repeat test was negative so it was stopped.
It was initially thought that his tachcyardia was secondary to withdrawel from sedation and optiod administration for the entire month that he was ventilated.
Carvedilol should be titrated to HR in 100-120's as BP will tolerate.
