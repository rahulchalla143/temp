His ascites had been increasing over last week even though he had had 3.5L drained 1 week ago and had lasix dose increased from 60 mg to 40mg.
In ED had temp to 98.0  P 80-97  BP 87/42  R18 Sat 97%on 3L, sepsis line placed, give 8L NS, diagnostic para done with 91WBC and given ceftriaxzone 1gm, vanc 1gm, and flagyl 500mg x1.
Preliminary CT abdomen showed -new left pleural effusion -marked ascites, increased since [**2169-8-14**]; new splenic infarctions; patent splenic, portal and superior mesenteric veins -bowel wall thickening likely related to ascites/low albumin; patent proximal celiac axis and SMA -unchanged liver masses; enlarged left hip mass.
Liver enzymes were not elevated.
He was sent for US guided biopsy of the lesion in late [**2167**], however the lesion was not localizable on biopsy due to it's small size, and it was therefore decided to follow expectantly with serial CT and AFP measurements.
His AFP stayed relatively constant, as did the size of the mass on CT over the ensuing year.
In early [**2168**], however, he was admitted in [**Country 651**] for an episode of hepatic decompensation, and subsequently in [**9-17**] a CT abdomen showed a new 2.5 cm mass in the liver.
Platelet transfusions failed to elevate his platelet count significantly.
Most recent CT on [**8-21**] demonstrated an increase in size of the liver lesion to 4 x 3 cm, also with increase in soft tissue component of L hip hematoma worrisome for metastatic disease.
