Recommend follow up CXR post diuresis to exclude underlying infection .
Specimen was sent for culture and Gram stain.
# CHF exacerbation: On admission, his chest xray showed mild to moderate pulmonary edema however admission vitals were O2 sat 95% RA.
CTA was done out of concern for PE as patient was noted to have LLE swelling.
The CTA was negative for PE and showed mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.
BNP was 7346.
TTE was checked on [**1-18**] which showed regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (EF 25%), moderate calcific aortic stenosis, moderate pulmonary HTN and moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] was seen by his cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] while in house.
On the day of discharge, he had appropriate oxygen saturation on RA and appeared euvolemic.
An echocardiogram in 05/99 showed EF of 45% with mild MR, AR and apical aneurysm.
On admission, his EKG showed new TWI in V4-V6 with troponin of 0.05>0.07.
Troponins continued to remain elevated.
EKG was unchanged, patient did not have chest pain.
As troponins have not trended down, concern for AMI given elevated troponins and change in EF from 45 to 25% on most recent echo.
He had a CTA done to rule out PE as above, which showed pneumobilia, distended GB with stones and sludge and fluid around fossa.
He was febrile and tachycardic with a white count peaking at 27.
There was significant concern for cholecystitis and HIDA was done which was also consistent with cholecystitis.
The bile cultures grew GNR and enterococcus.
He was given doses of vancomycin while the enterococcus sensitivities were pending to treat possible VRE.
Blood cultures and urine cultures remained negative.
He will require daily abdominal exams and monitoring of his white blood cell count to rule out infection.
On the day of discharge his creatinine was 1.2 and he was maintaining good urine output.
His blood pressure remained in good control.
His hematocrit was checked and appeared to be stable.
His electrolytes were followed and repleted as needed.
You will also need follow up for further evaluation and possible biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass.
