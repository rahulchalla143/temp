Pt had an EGD performed which demonstrated no varices per the pt, though it did demonstrated "small ulcers."
Pt also had a CT torso [**2118-3-25**] at [**Hospital1 **] showing an enlarged and heterogeneous liver, indicating either cirrhosis with regenerating nodules or dysplastic nodules.
The patient's gastroenterologist recommended the pt be electively admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
In the ED, vitals: t95, bp 110/64, hr 56, rr 16, sat 97% ra.

This finding appears to have been present on prior ultrasound and CT examinations.
A biopsy may be of benefit for pathologic evaluation.

Imaging was consistent with cirrhosis, though biopsy would be needed to confirm diagnosis.
The liver service was consulted and a full work-up was initiated.
Hepatitis serologies were unremarkable.
Iron studies were suggestive of hemochromatosis and hemochromatosis gene analysis was positive for a homozygous C282Y mutation.
An abdominal MRI demonstrated background hemosiderosis, a large left lobe liver mass compatible with hepatoma invading left portal vein with left portal vein thrombosis, and additional multifocal areas of signal abnormality scattered throughout both lobes of liver compatible with multifocal hepatoma.
