CXR showed PTX on left with no shift or tension.
CTA C/A/P was obtained which showed consistent findings with PTX, bilateral pulmonary emboli, DVT in left common iliac left superficial femoral veins, and extensive metastatic progression with innumerable mets to the liver and bones.
Also obtained head CT which shows edema at sites of known brain mets.
Got 6L fluid and SBP improved.
Lactate was 7.2 with increase to 12.1 after a few hours.
Vitals on transfer were 107/71, 80, 18, 98% RA .
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: (Per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 91178**] Note [**2185-11-10**]) NSCLC stage IV adenocarcinoma EGFR/ALK/KRAS w/t - [**7-/2185**] Developed progressive DOE and weight loss - [**2185-9-8**] Presented to her PCP with DOE, referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where she was found to have a LUL mass on CXR.
CT chest showed mass in the left upper lobe measuring up to 4.6 cm, causing complete collapse of the left upper lobe.
Heat CT revealed new brain mets.
- [**2185-9-9**] Brain CT showed right parietal lobe mass at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction, with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema and 5-mm left [**Hospital1 **] shift.
- [**2185-9-10**] Brain MRI showed right posterior frontal and anterior parietal mass measuring approximately 3 cm.
- [**2185-9-14**] Resection of  brain met, consistent with NSCLC adenocarcinoma of lung primary - [**Date range (1) 91179**] CyberKnive to brain lesion - [**2185-10-6**] PET CT showed intensely avid paraortic lymph node demonstrated adjacent to the primary left upper lobe mass measuring 21 x 17mm.
Known right cerebellar metastasis is better appreciated on the prior MRI from [**2185-9-30**].
- [**2185-10-31**] MRI of the brain showed multiple new mets - [**2185-11-1**] Start WBRT, planned to complete on [**12-15**] .

Lactate was 12 on transfer for [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
SBP improved to 100s s/p 6L IVF in ED.
While she has a PTX and PE, these are not likely to have contributed to hypotension as PE were subsegmental and PTX was not tension and had no shift.
Obtained blood and urine cultures to rule out infection/sepsis as cause of hypotension.
She then decided to become comfort measures only on [**2185-12-9**], and vital signs were discontinued.
Right upper/lower PEs/DVT: Evidence of large left common and right superficial femoral vein DVTs.
