His Hct remained stable throughout his hospital course.
He was seen by interventional pulmonology who did a flexible bronchoscopy followed by a rigid bronchoscopy for Y-Stent placement on the following day ([**2176-9-3**]).
His BP meds were initially held, but once BP was >140/90, Metoprolol was restarted.
Oygen saturation isuues post-op most likely due to Y-Stent placement and irritation of the airways.
Hemoptysis 2.
You were observed in the medical ICU here and were seen by the interventional lung doctors who did a bronchoscopy to look at your airways.
