CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2186-5-2**]: Radiology Report CT ABD W&W/O C Study Date of [**2186-5-1**] 2:00 PM   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] M. OMED 11R [**2186-5-1**] CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 63987**] Reason: baseline eval prior to starting new therapy.
TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained followed by contrast-enhanced axial CT images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis as well as three minute delays of the kidneys only.
Multiplanar reformatted images were also submitted for review.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  No axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is seen.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Two small round subcentimeter hypodensities within the right lobe of the liver are unchanged from prior studies (4:26, and 4:7).
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Diverticulosis is again appreciated.
Partial compression fracture of T9 is not significantly changed.
She underwent a pre-enrollment TTE and CT torso while in-patient.
