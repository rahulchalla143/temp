In the ED, she was initially normotensive but then dropped her bp with a map in the 50s.
Lactate was 4.
She had a subclavian line placed (currently undocumented) and was given 4L NS without improvement in her bp or lactate, so was started on levophed.
Had chest CT showing large amorphous neck and supraclavicular mass, differential hematoma vs malignancy.

2) Right adrenal nodule cannot be assessed on this examination due to motion artifact which was likely due to patient fatigue from this extended study.
*********** ECHO [**2194-6-6**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function appears normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Initially suspicious for hematoma from Chest CT ([**2194-6-3**]).
MRI ([**2194-6-7**]) showed the mass to be diffusely enhancing, suggestive of malignancy.
Discharge Instructions: She has a lymphoma in her neck and after discussions with the physicians and family, it has been decided not to pursue any further workup or treatment of her lymphoma.
