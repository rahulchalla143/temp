2 days later, he had CP across his chest BL, stabbing [**8-31**] worse w/breathing.
There, he was afebrile HR 124, BP 118/88.
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia w/poor R-wave progression and TWI in V4-V6.
He had guiac +stools and HCT 27.9.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x 1.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis was negative for PE but revealed a 2cm pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions.
He was transferred here for further evaluation of GIB.
In the ED, Tm 99.7 HR 112 BP 143/86 O2sat100%2L.
TTE in ED revealed 2cm pericardial effusion w/o tamponade physiology.
Currently, the patient endorses [**8-31**] stabbing chest pain which he describes as worst w/lying on his left side, worse w/deep breaths, and sitting up, associated w/SOB.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
============== CXRPortable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly consistent with known pericardial effusion.
Left retrocardiac consolidation which may represent a combination of atelectasis and pneumonia   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 54yoM w/h/o laparoscopic gastric bypass who was transferred from an OSH for evaluation of GIB and management of his pericardial effusion.
The pathology returned after his discharge, so results were not discussed with him.
He was advised to discuss capsule endoscopy with his providers in [**State 33977**].
Elevated lipase which resolved within 24 hrs and no evidence of pancreatitis on CT at OSH.
- cardiac enzymes negative x 2 - pain improved throughout hospitalizaiton - no NSAIDS due to GIB .
- blood negative, urine cx negative .
# Polysubstance Abuse: last drink 10 days ago, no h/o withdrawal seizures - normal LFTs, but increased INR - SW consult, advised to abstain from alcohol.
Your chest pain is from pericarditis, and you should follow up with a cardiologist in [**State 33977**] to repeat the heart ultrasound (echocardiogram) in a few weeks.
You had an endoscopy and colonoscopy in the hospital to evaluate bleeding, and no source of blood was found.
