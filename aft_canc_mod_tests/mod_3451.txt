Tranesophageal Echocardiogram 6.
Renal biopsy   History of Present Illness: 49 yo M with a history of ESRD, secondary to kidney transplant failure who was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for suspected TTP-HUS.
The patient presented to the OSH and was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions on chest CT, Hct 20.5, K 7.8 Cr 4.2 and glucose > 400.
He receieved 2 units of PRBCs which bumped his Hct to 24.7.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Gout   Social History: lives by himself, divorced; no EtOH or tobacco   Family History: diabetes mellitus   Physical Exam: VS: 97.1   84   160/77   26  97% on 6L NC GEN: tachypnic, using accessory muscles to breath HEENT: PERRL, MM slightly dry Cor: irregularly irregular Lungs: b/l crackles, wheezes Abd: +BS, s/distended/no TTP Ext: trace pitting edema, WWP, 2+ pulses throughout Neuro: alert, somnolent, responds to questions slowly, EOMI but sluggish, 4/5 strength in UE b/l Skin: 1.5 cm healing linear incision on L forehead   Pertinent Results: OSH RECORDS: [**2171-12-6**] CHEST CT: CHF, RLL infiltrate [**2171-12-4**] BNP 896, Rheumatoid factor 17 (0-13) [**2171-11-15**] PFTs: FVC moderately reduce, FEV1 mildly to moderately reduced/ FEV1/FVC = normal, TLC moderately reduced.
[**2171-11-15**] ECHO: EF 60-65%, mild concentric LVH, oderate biatrial enlargement; mildr tricuspid and trace pulmonic regurgitation.
Bronchial washings [**12-13**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CT chest: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Blasts (peripheral blood and marrow) were enumerated at <1%.
We further recommend a repeat biopsy for confirmation and evaluation for definitive diagnosis.
Bronchial washings [**12-19**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
TEE [**1-6**]: 1 The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
CT torso: 1.
Repeat TEE [**1-15**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo M w/ ESRD s/p kidney transplant on chronic immunosuppressive therapy, presenting with AMS, thrombocytopenia, ARF, hemolytic anemia and pancytopenia, and respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, with MDS on BM bx and persistent fevers of unknown origin, now on HD.
EF by [**2171-12-16**] TTE was normal at 60% so CHF unlikely contributor.
Cultures revealed no growth and he completed a 7 day course of zosyn/vancomycin for possible ventilator associated pneumonia.
He had a thorough work up for infection with all culture and serology negative except for a weakly positive IgM for Ehrlichia at IgM Ab + 1:80 titer.
Further studies were sent and he was started on doxycycline for presumed Ehrlichia infection.
Urine, blood, stool, respiratory cultures remained negative except for some yeast which grew from BAL and sputum cultures.
Because of persistent fevers his temporary dialysis catheter as well as his PICC were pulled and tip cultures were negative.
CMV serologies and viral load were drawn initially and were negative.
BK virus, cryptococcal Ag, and Babesia PCR were also drawn.
His hypotension responded to fluid boluses.
Blood cultures grew coag negative staph in [**1-4**] blood culture bottles and his Zosyn was d/c'ed.
A renal biopsy did not suggest transplant rejection as a cause of fevers.
He also received a CT abdomen to evaluate for intrabdominal abscess, lymphoma, or other malignancy which was negative.
However, bone marrow biopsy was obtained and was suggestive of MDS and cyclosporin was restarted.
Parvovirus DNA and Ehrlichia serologies were drawn as above to work up possible contribution and Ehrlichia was only weakly positive.
Hematology Oncology recommended outpatient follow up to determine whether he required any further evaluation or treatment for possible MDS.
# Acute on CRI - s/p renal transplant.
Cyclosporine level was 89 on admission but concern for contribution to pancytopenia and was stopped as above.
He received a biopsy of his transplant kidney which showed no evidence of acute rejection.
His urine output eventually began to improve and his dialysis was again decreased to ~ 3 times a week as needed.
He should have 24 hour urine studies checked intermittently to determine need for further dialysis.
Blood pressures improved with initiation of daily dialysis and he blood pressure medications were cut back.
Eventually he was restarted on labetolol with hydralazine as needed with good blood pressure control.
He then had a repeat TEE which verified that he had no clots in his atria.
His HRs were monitored with the start of amiodarone to determine the need for diltiazem weaning as the amiodarone took effect.
Stool studies were all negative including cultures and C diff toxin A and B were negative throughout admission.
