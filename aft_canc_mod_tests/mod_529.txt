----- Head CT [**5-4**]:IMPRESSION: Post-operative appearance to the brain without evidence of transtentorial or uncal herniation, and with minimal leftward subfalcine herniation, that was also present on the prior study.
----- Head MR 4/21:1.
1.8-cm enhancing mass in the right frontoparietal lesion with hemorrhagic component, with edema that partially enters into right side of the splenium of corpus callosum, corresponding to the finding on CT scan.
----- CT torso:Large, heterogeneously-enhancing, necrotic left renal neoplasm, likely renal cell carcinoma.
CT head in the ED showed a round mass in the R-parietal region ([**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white junction) with extensive edema.
An MRI with contrast was ordered which showed the mass in more detail.
His exam remained essentially unchanged afterwards.
He then had a torso CT which showed a large 11.1 x 18.3 x 13.1 cm renal mass on the left.
CV: Continued atenolol, but his creatinine was initially [**Last Name (LF) 14490**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] we stopped his HCTZ.
