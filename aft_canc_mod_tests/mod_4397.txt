t (15;17) (q22; q21)) rearrangement (see separate complete report).
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-5-11**], LV wall motion is better assessed with use of contrast.
Reticulocyte index = 0.3 so abnl marrow response to anemia.
BMT was consulted, and bone marrow was pursued.
Hemolysis labs wnl, but coag panels abnormal (see below).
We monitored labs first Q8h, and spaced to daily when DIC was reversed with transfusions of appropriate blood products.
Urine initially grew out ESBL and Enterococcus, and she was treated with meropenem and defervesced.
She again became febrile almost two weeks later, in the setting of her blood count nadir, and was treated with Vancomycin, Meropenem and Micafungin.
Blood cultures and urine cultures remained negative.
ECG normal on admission.
LENIS negative and Echo showed normal systolic function.
HBV VL was negative but started Lamivudine after discussio nwith hepatology.
Repeat viral load prior to discharge was negative.
Quantiferon gold test was intermdiate, Infectious disease consult recommended INH treatment however given elevated transaminases, treatment with INH was deferred.
