Large soft soft-tissue mass is again seen filling much of the upper right hemithorax with extension along the right lateral chest wall, consistent with the patient's known malignancy.
CXR demonstrating worsening opacity of the right lung concerning for post-obstructive pneumonia vs. hemorrhage (Hct has dropped 35-->28 but in setting of chemo 10 days ago) vs. edema/effusion, though no other evidence systemically vs. disease progression, unclear if this would also be causing fever, lactate rise.
Urine culture no growth, blood culture pending at this time.
