At baseline she ambulates with a walker however recently she has been more fatigued as has required 2L O2 to keep sats above 90%.
Reportedly a CXR was done at rehab which showed unilateral pleural effusion, abdominal US done showed pericardial effusion.
However, echocardiogram done on [**7-2**] did not show pericardial effusion but showed 4+ TR, LVEF 35-40%, 1+ MR, 1+ AR.
In the ED, vital signs are BP 180/100, HR 70, RR 22, O2sat 100% on NRB.
Labs were notable for WBC count 10.9, neut 85%, hct 52, INR 4.5, normal lactate.
CXR showed moderate opacification of the entire right hemithorax likely related to both a moderate-to-large sized right-sided pleural effusion and reactive atelectasis.
Oxygen saturation was 100% on CPAP and she was switched to a nonrebreather.
Coronary artery disease, status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2186**], status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of her left anterior descending with an ejection fraction of 77%.
Arthritis 14.
EKG atrial fibrillation at 99 bpm, leftward axis, nl intervals, Q waves in III, aVF, V1-V3TWI I, aVL, ?
STD V6.
Compared to EKG dated [**2192-4-1**] unchanged.
PORTABLE CHEST, [**2199-7-5**] COMPARISON: Previous study of earlier the same date.
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**7-8**] CT Torso: COMPARISON: CT torso, [**2192-8-14**].
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are no pathologically enlarged axillary lymph nodes.
Scattered retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Evaluation of the pelvis is limited due to right hip prosthesis.
Calcifications within the uterus likely represent fibroids.
Mesothelial cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, blood and roteinaceous debris.

Had CT torso to eval for malignancy and no source found, but pleural effusion on right has reaccumulated and is also slightly on left.
She did not complain of sob, feeling her breathing was better, but did have an O2 requirement of 2L to keep sat over 90%.
She was given 10mg po lasix on day of discharge as her Na and Cl were dropping consistent with hypervolemia.
Continue to titrate BB to goal rate of 60-70.
NA dropped to 130 on [**7-9**], most likely dilutional from volume overload.
INR > 3 on [**7-8**], held x 1, was 2.8 on [**7-9**], to be given 2mg coumadin tonight, was overlapped with lovenox for 48hrs.
Given thrombus, if INR drops below 2.0 would resume lovenox temporarily.
