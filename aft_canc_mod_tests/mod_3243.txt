On [**9-13**] and [**9-20**], the patient bled from her tumor, requiring multiple washcloths and prolonged application of pressure to stop the bleeding.
In the ED, the patient was afebrile and 91% on RA; sats increased to 97-98% on 3L NC.
She had borderline low blood pressures in the 80s/40s but maintained her mentation and urine output; baseline BPs in the 100s per her report.
CTA of the chest demonstrated no pulmonary embolism but a large R sided pleural effusion.
Blood cultures were sent, and she received levofloxacin 500 mg IV X 1 for treatment of pneumonia.
She also received 1 L NS and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Comparison is made with prior studies from [**9-25**] and 17.
Her chest wall lesions were infected on arrival, and have a great liklihood of recurrent infection and bleeding.
Initial workup included the following: PE was ruled out by CTA chest.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Patient was maintained on [**2-15**] Lit NC while in hospital with O2 sats greater than 92%.
Patient was hypotensive to SBP of 80s on admission.
She was bolused IVFs and given blood transfusions with improvement of her blood pressure.
Her BP is usually between 75-85 systolic, asymptomatic and mentating well.
Anemia: Patient had a Hct of 21.9 on admission with MCV of 88 with a baseline crit of 30 - 35.
Patient was transfused 2 units to keep Hct greater than 25.
Hct remained stable.
Patient has creatinine of 1.3 on admission with baseline of 0.8.
A digoxin level was 1.4 on [**2156-9-28**].
However, digoxin was stopped on [**9-29**] because of the difficulty with monitoring digoxin levels due to difficulty drawing blood, absence of symptoms while in atrial fibrillation, and patients' desire for hospice care.
12. oxygen continuous at 2-4 L by nasal canula to keep sats > 94% 13.
Please have a chest xray done before that appointment in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] building at [**Location (un) 830**] (you can walk in at any time).
The number for interventional pulmonology is [**Telephone/Fax (1) **].
