Echo [**2102-11-8**] Conclusions: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal  (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Cath 10/26/105 Prelim.
Right heart catheterization revealed slightly elevated left and right heart filling pressures.
The mean pericardial pressure was 5mm HG, decreasing to 2mm Hg with drainage of 360ml of bloody fluid.
Echo [**2102-11-10**] Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal  (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2102-11-9**], the findings are  similar.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression and Plan - Pt.
Previous work up for the effusion included normal TSH 0.3 [**10-18**] and PSA of 0.1 [**10-18**].
DDx for pleural effusion is wide however given the cell count with numerous RBC, this is likely hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
8 percent according to a recent study in Chest [**2096**] [**Month (only) **];116(6):1564-9.
Pump - EF >55% on echo done [**11-8**].
Repeat echo [**11-10**] showed preserved lvef, full report in results section.
