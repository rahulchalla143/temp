At outside hospital, the gas on 100% FIO2 of 85, pCO2 30, pH 7.47 with a systolic blood pressure of 70.
Chest x-ray revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary disease consistent with lymphangitic carcinomatosis and perhaps pulmonary edema.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated inferior ST elevation and ST depression in V2 and Q waves in the inferior leads.
Troponin-I peak at 1.92, peak CK at 210.
CT scan of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolus.
Echocardiogram demonstrated ejection fraction of 50% with posterior wide hypokinesis, mild MR and mild TR.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 **], where he underwent catheterization revealing 90% lesion in the mid right coronary artery with thrombus.
Catheterization here revealed 60-70% lesion in the mid circ and distal circ in addition to the right coronary artery lesion.
He was given Lasix, intravenous nitroglycerin, and placed on 100% nonrebreather at which time his oxygen saturation improved to 90-100%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals at that time included a heart rate of 58, blood pressure 132/61, respirations 19, and he was 96% on nonrebreather.
A recent ETT showed inferior fixed defects, ejection fraction of 50%.
His oxygen was gradually weaned down to 2 liters nasal cannula, however, there was not much improvement following this intervention.
Patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells to maintain his hematocrit above 30 with a recent coronary event.
His laboratories on admission were 17.7, 32.4 hematocrit, platelets 189.
Sodium 144, potassium 3.8, chloride 110, bicarb 21, BUN 42, creatinine 0.8, glucose 157, calcium 8.7, magnesium 2.0, phosphorus 3.9.
His QTC was monitored because of the prepencity of Levaquin to lengthen QTC.
