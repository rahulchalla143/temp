In the ED she was found to have a UTI and was started on cipro and admitted.
The rapid response team was called, and after further decompensating to unresponsiveness with a O2 sat of 92% on high flow O2 (35%), she was intubated.
Of note her INR was therapeutic at admission, decreased to 1.8 on [**8-25**], and then again therapeutic [**8-26**].
It appears coumadin was continued until yesterday, when it was held for pending evaluation here of skull base tumor.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4048**] was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic [**2186-8-21**] for a putative, non-biopsy proven, paraganglioma of the left skull base, invasive.
Her last brain MRI was done [**2-/2186**] (report in Atrius) which noted that "there was a marked increase in size of the metastatic lesion in the left petrous apex bone.
Workup included imaging of the skull base, which included an MRI in [**Month (only) 956**] this year as a follow up set of images.
The MRI read from [**Month (only) 956**] suggests "a metastatic lesion."
She saw an ear, nose and throat surgeon at [**Hospital 13128**] who suggested that intervention surgically would be dangerous and result in significant morbidity given the location of the tumor at the skull base adjacent to cranial nerves and great vessels.
-CHF (unknown EF) -morbid obesity -Hypercoaguable with Factor V Leiden mutation and positive lupus anticoagulant - hx pulmonary embolism, on lifelong Coumadin.

The left skull base mass involves the anterior and posterior elements of C1 and C2.
Chronic compression deformities of T1 through T3 vertebral bodies, without evidence of associated masses.
MRI head/MRA head/MRI skull base 1.
Corneal reflex was present on the right, but absent on the left.
We pursued further evaluation of this mass to look for potential treatment.
MRI C spine with invasion of skull base mass into C1, C2 also with T2 enhancement of the cord from cervicocranial junction to C3.
