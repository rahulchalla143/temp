His pulses were serially monitored with as dopplerable signal in his bilateral DP/PTs.
Vitals signs were closely monitored via telemetry.
This was attributable to demand ischemia, his troponin remained elevated at 0.32 with no change in his CK-MB.
On discharge, he had no cardiac issues, his blood pressure had normalized with his beta-blocker, and his home Coumadin was continued for his atrial fibrillation.
Pulse oximetry was monitored closely and the patient maintained adequate oxygenations.
GENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was closely monitored in the immediate post-operative period, but is minimal given his peritoneal dialysis needs.
The patient's creatinine was elevated, but this is baseline.
HEME: The patient's post-op hematocrit was trended closely and he was transfused 2 units of packed red cells over the course of HOD#[**2-20**] which was attributed to demand ischemia.
A CT scan was obtained on [**2150-5-15**] to ensure there was no retroperitoneal bleeding to create the demand ischemia and cardiac issues.
His hematocrit stabilized and no further transfusions were required.
Their white count was stable post-operatively and their incision was closely monitored for any evidence of infection or erythema.
Blood glucose levels greater than 120 mg/dL were addressed with an insulin sliding scale.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
