She was evaluated as an outpatient with a cardiac stress test which is reportedly normal.
On f/u chest xray with her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] large [**Name Initial (PRE) **] sided mass was discovered and she was subsequently sent for CTChest which confirmed presence of a large R atrial mass (thought to be within the atrium).
She was sent to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
During this admission she has undergone evaluation with TTE, MRI and 3D Echo in an effort to further localize the mass.

Large 9.8 x 10.0 cm mass causing compression of the right atrium and superior vena cava which is either arising from the pericardium or the right atrium which will be further evaluated on planned echocardiogram performed today.
Differential diagnostic considerations include both primary and metastatic masses.
This may be further characterized with a dedicated adrenal mass protocol CT for further characterization.
If CT cannot be performed MR may be repeated with dedicated adrenal protocol.
However, these are incompletely characterized and given the clinical scenario, further evaluation with MR lumbar spine is recommended.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Upon arrival abdominal MRI, bilateral lower extremity duplex and echocardiogram (see above report) were obtained.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended tissue biopsy obtained via CT guided IR, mediastinoscopy, VATS or EBUS with IP.
Answering service will contact on call person during off hours**   Followup Instructions: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] office will call on Monday [**5-16**] with instructions for the biopsy of the paracardial mass.
