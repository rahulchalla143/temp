At this point in his course, he was noted to have desaturations and vital signs revealing that he was 100% around MN Tuesday am then nadirs to 84-91% on RA in the early am Tuesday.
Vitals at that time: 99.4, 169/88, 22, 94% 4L NC.
Through the night his blood pressure has improved from hypertensive but now down to 100-120's, and pulse improved from 100's to 70-80's.
He had swallow study which he passed.
Cardiac echo was performed.
Vitals by call out: 100.4 at 3a,  98.4   p81   107/55.
On exam, overall he looks 180 degrees better, his dyspnea is better, juguluar pulsations noted at angle of mandiblelungs are surprisingly very clear, RRR with slower rate and crescendo-descrescendo AS type murmur heard, abdomen soft NT ND benign, no BLE edema, and extremities are warm and well perfused.
Labs showed a declining Hct but improved WBC count and plts from prior.
Chemistry panel shows improved Na, HCO3; however BUN/Cr ratio are slightly worse.
He had developed a mild elevation in Troponin while CK and MB are negative; most recent EKG shows improved rate.
CXR has no read yet, to me it appears very minimally improved but still with a very impressive L > R infiltrates.
Due to persistent tachycardia while on the medica service, with the evenua development of relative hypotension,the patient was transferred to the cardiology service for ongoig management of her heart rate and blood pressure.
On my review of his vitals and telemetry, his blood pressure and pulse are dramatically improved and pulses are in the 60's even with ambulation with PT.
His WBC count is still elevated, but he has had no fevers, and cultures were negative.
He is not acting infected by my evaluation, and I suspect that the elevated WBC count may be part of the hematological process that is driving his platelets up, but cannot be sure.
He is stable on room air, and his CXR is improved but still with infiltrates that I still suspect are aspiration event and not edema or PNA.

[**11-12**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique, there is a mild interval increase in the left hemispheric subdural hematoma.
[**11-13**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: 1.
[**11-14**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: Status post burr hole and craniotomy for bilateral subdural hemorrhage evacuation, with decreased degree of pneumocephalus and extent of the hemorrhages.
[**11-15**] CTA chest IMPRESSION: 1.
However, evaluation of the segmental and subsegmental branches was suboptimal due to inadequate opacification.
[**11-15**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-11**]: Widespread new interstitial pulmonary abnormality, increase in heart size and mediastinal vascular engorgement are findings of pulmonary edema due to cardiac decompensation.
Asymmetric edema, if that is the diagnosis, was explained by emphysema seen on the chest CTA performed earlier today.
[**2112-11-16**]: echo The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The cardiac silhouette and hilar contours appear otherwise unchanged.
[**2112-11-19**] CXR FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is normal in size and has decreased slightly from previous study.
10/19/201 CXR IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**11-15**] through 15: Pulmonary edema on [**11-17**] has largely resolved.
There is the suggestion of a new nodule in the left mid lung at the level of the sixth posterior interspace, not present on either prior chest radiographs or CTA on [**11-15**], and, if real, would have to be a septic embolus.
When feasible I would obtain conventional chest radiographs to see if a nodule is present and [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] evaluate the residual abnormality in the right lung.
Hiscourse was particularly notable for hypertension and supraventricular tachycardia whih were difficult to control, and persistently elevated WBC and platelet count in the setting of know hematologic disease.
Bilateral subdurals: Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service.
CT scan on [**11-12**] revealed slight increase in SDH.
Pt was started on Dilantin with normal levels through admission and discharged on 150 TID to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**5-11**] wks with repeat head CT at that time.
CTA was performed but did not show evidence of PE; it did show bilateral ground glass opacities concerning for aspiration vs pulmonary hemorrhage, given his essential thrombocytosis and increased predilection for bleeding.
We noted that a CXR prior to discharge to evaluate interval changes was formally read as possible infiltrate vs septic emboli.
His rate/rhythm improved to sinus in the 50-60's with only occasional ectopy, even when walking.
The pt and his family were repeatedly instructed on him being on 3 blood pressure and rate medications and that as his underlying intracranial process resolves, to be careful for bradycardia, hypotension, and what to look out for.
Pt with platelet count 600's through initial part of admission and ASA/Anagrelide held; however during latter part of admission his plt count continued to rise.
Plt count continued to rise up to ~1500 by discharge however the patient completely asymptomatic, and the final readig pior to discharge appeared to have begun to improve.
Of note ws a persistent WBC count ~14 on admission, peak to 17, then downtrending to 14 on d/c.
Medications on Admission: - Anagralide 1g [**Hospital1 **] - Levofloxacin 500mg qd prescribed by PCP on Thursday - Simvastatin 40 qd - Lisinopril 30 qd - Ferrous sulfate 325 qd - Aspirin 81 qd - MVI - Vit D 400 qd - Gingko Biloba 400 qd - Vitamin A - Vitamin C - Vitamin B complex .
Vitamin C  Oral 7.

Then, on [**11-27**] only take 400 mg daily until your Cardiology follow up.
Then, on [**11-27**] only take 400 mg daily until your Cardiology follow up.
Afterwards, you had low oxygen levels; tests showed that you did not have a pulmonary embolus, but there were abnormalities in your lungs that could have been due to aspiration (stomach contents inhaled into your lungs), or blood loss into your lungs, but the latter was felt to be less likely.
Your high blood pressure could have also contributed to some fluid buildup into your lungs, for which you were given a medication to remove fluid.
Finally, you were given medications to slow down your heart rate and will need to continue them until Cardiology follow up, at which point you should discuss whether or not to continue them.
Your platelet count rose because you were off Anagrelide for awhile but this was restarted as appropriate.
You had some blood loss from a level of 33 to 26 likely due to the surgery, but this was stable and improved to 28 by discharge.
START Amiodarone: this medication was started to keep your heart rate down.
INCREASE Lisinopril to 40 mg daily (from 30 mg daily) this will help your blood pressure 5.
START Labetalol 200 mg twice a day - this is for blood pressure and heart rate.
START Metoprolol 25 mg four times a day - this is for blood pressure and heart rate.
We discussed things to look out for: dizziness or lightheadedness at rest or on standing, feeling not well, pulses less than 40 with symtpoms, chest pain, palpitations, paleness, etc.
Finally, just before discharge you received a chest X-ray that as we discussed showed resolving abnormalities, but were concerning for other areas that we feel are not clinically relevant because you were doing so well.
