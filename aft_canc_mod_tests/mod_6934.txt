Thoracentesis was performed at bedside with drainage of 1.5L of fluid with negative gram stain, exudative chemistry, and lymphocyte predominance with cytology pending at the time of discharge though overall felt to be c/w prior malignant pleural effusion.
His breathing improved and he felt clinically well but was occasionally hypotensive to as low as the 70's systolically, asymptomatic the whole time.
As part of the infectious workup, he underwent RUQ U/S which showed no evidence of cholecytitis.
As his blood, urine, and sputum studies were negative, and pulmonary was the only organ system that could possibly be involved, he was discharged with four more days of PO levaquin to finish an 8 day course.
On discussion with his daughter, it was determined that he has blood pressures that are this low and asymptomatic at rehab.
