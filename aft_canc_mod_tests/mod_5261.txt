ECHO ([**2128-4-29**]): Suboptimal image quality.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended.
RUE ULTRASOUND ([**2128-4-30**]): Clot in the right basilic vein.
BIOPSY ([**2128-4-28**]): Periampullary mass, mucosal biopsies: Adenomatous mucosal fragments, predominantly with low grade dysplasia; see note.
BRUSHINGS ([**2128-4-28**]): POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with adenocarcinoma.
CXR [**2128-5-4**]: Moderately-severe pulmonary edema is unchanged, but moderate right and small left pleural effusion have both increased substantially since [**4-28**].
Cholangitis 4.
Initial treatment for GNR was pip-tazo.
Regarding possible bacterial endocarditis, an echo showed a small mobile mass which may represents a small vegetation on the tricuspid valve.
Adenocarcinoma: CT abdomen showed enhancing lesion around pacreatic head.
Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Noted to have pulmonary edema on CXR in the setting of IVF for hypotension.
day prior to discharge he was noted to require oxygen and repeat CXR showed increased bilateral pleural effusions.
