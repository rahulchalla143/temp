She initially presented to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital where a CXR showed reaccumulation of pleural effusion on the right.
ECG showed sinus tachycardia with ST depressions V4 to V6 which were new, thought to be rate-related.
on [**2117-12-23**] (2) Cyberknife radiosurgery to the 1-right frontal lobe resection cavity to 2400 cGy (800 cGy x 3 fractions) at 84% isodose line from [**2118-1-26**] to [**2118-1-28**] (3) lumbar puncture on [**2118-6-23**] showed 0 WBC, 31 protein, and negative cytology for malignant cells (4) status post Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2118-7-6**] at 2-right frontal metastasis to [**2108**] cGy at 70% isodose line and 3-left frontal metastasis to 2200 cGy at 77% isodose line.

She was well until [**2112**] when she developed a cough and a chest X-ray showed a shadow.
Biopsy showed adenocarcinoma that was ER positive, PR negative, HER-2 negative by FISH.
A right upper lobe transbronchial biopsy on [**2115-6-26**] showed adenocarcinoma, and her treatment was switched to Xeloda on [**2115-12-18**].
Her neurological problem began in later [**Name (NI) **] and early [**2117-12-7**], with pounding [**Hospital1 **]-frontal headaches that radiated to the occiput.
A gadolinium-enhanced head MRI on [**2117-12-21**] showed a right frontal enhancing mass with surrounding cerebral edema, mass effect, and 2 mm of midline shift.
The pathology was ER positive metastatic breast carcinoma.

A moderate-to-large right pleural effusion appears similar when compared to the prior reference chest radiograph, and has increased when compared to the prior chest radiograph of [**2119-11-29**].
IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, increased when compared to prior radiograph from [**2119-11-29**].
CXR [**2119-12-5**]: The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
CXR [**2119-12-12**]: FINDINGS: One portable upright AP view of the chest.
Echo [**2119-12-6**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Pathology: Pleura, biopsy (A): Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, morphologically consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma.
Right pleural fluid, cell block: Non-diagnostic; the specimen did not survive processing.

Her pressures did not respond to fluids.
The patient's blood pressures stabilized and we were able to wean off neo.
The patient's blood pressures were stable on the Oncology floor off of hydrocortisone and a random cortisol was 25 - it was felt it would be very unlikely for her to have adrenal insufficiency in that setting.
She was volume resucitated and her urine output ultimately improved.
Pleural fluid was negative for fungus, AFB, anaerobes, and culture did not grow out anything.
Their exam revealed no fistula, but an atrophic perineum, thought [**2-8**] trauma from childbirth and poor nutritional status.
Troponins were negative, and repeat ECG the next morning was unchanged from prior.
# Diabetes Mellitus / Hypoglycemia: She was hypoglycemic the morning after admission with glucose 48 on her AM labs and FBG 65.
Her blood sugars the day of discharge were all > 90. .
After the procedure, your blood pressure was persistently low, so you were monitored in the ICU.
Your blood pressure improved and you were cared for on the general medicine floor.
