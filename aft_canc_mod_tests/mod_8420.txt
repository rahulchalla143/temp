A nuclear medicine WBC scan done in [**Location (un) 620**] in [**Month (only) **] of [**2188**] revealed increased uptake in several areas and she elevated ESR at that time.
She had plain films done in [**Month (only) 404**] of [**2189**] suggestive of hardware loosening and a periosteal reaction.
An ultrasound revealed a popliteal cyst which may be been reactive.
She went on to have a knee aspiration and arthrogram with the fluid being negative for cells and no growth(Specimens sent to Quest.)
A repeat WBC scan on [**2189-4-10**] revealed extension of the uptake in the bone marrow extending down to distal femur on the right with prominent uptake in bilateral lower extremity vasculature.
Postoperatively, the cultures ultimately grew Coag negative staph.
She was on Kefzol 1 G Q 8 starting on [**12-2**], switched to vancomycin [**12-3**] with reciept of culture data.
