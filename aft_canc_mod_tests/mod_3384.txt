Labs were unremarkable including a negative troponin, although BNP was elevatd at 361.
Her dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial, related to pleural effusion, atelectasis, pericardial effusion, and pulmonary masses.
TTE showed a moderate pericardial effusion without hemodynamic significance.
V/Q scan was low to intermediate probability for pulmonary embolus, and CXR and CT revealed progression of large soft tissue mass with atelectasis and increased loculated right pleural effusion.

CT Chest w/o Contrast [**2158-10-4**] OSH: 1.
TTE [**2158-10-5**] OSH: Fair image quality study.
However, the RV appears small, markedly so in the subcostal view, which would be consistent with increased intrapericardial pressures.
TTE [**2158-10-6**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
The study is of suboptimal technical quality and regional dysfunction, particularly in the anterior septum, cannot be fully excluded.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-9-22**], there appears to be a slight increase in the size of the pericardial effusion, also evidence of stranding and echo density suggestive of blood, cellular elements.
CXR [**2158-10-6**]: Moderate left pleural effusion is larger.
TTE [**2158-10-7**]: Suboptimal image quality.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-10-6**], no clear change.
CXR [**2158-10-8**]: The degree that the left main stem bronchus is visualized, it does appear to be somewhat narrowed, but possibly slightly improved compared with [**2158-10-7**] at 09:42 a.m.
TTE [**2158-10-9**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-10-7**], the findings are similar.
OSH evaluation revealed progression of underlying pulmonary disease with increased volume loss and atelectasis as well as bilateral pleural effusions.
She also had a V/Q scan with no evidence of PE.
Additionally, TTE revealed a moderate-sized pericardial effusion, without evidence of tamponade physiology.
Repeat TTEs did not show enlarging pericardial effusion or tamponade.
She was continued on Sutent with close monitoring of blood counts .
Per cardiology, pt needs repeat TTE next week (Monday [**10-16**]) at her appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
