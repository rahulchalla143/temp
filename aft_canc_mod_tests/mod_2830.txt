Today, when he went in for a previously scheduled CT scan at the OSH, the SOB had continued to worsen.
CT scan showed a large presumed hemothorax on the right with air in it suggestive of loculation.
Labs were significant for a WBC count of 17.7 and Hct of 32.5. .
2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: [**2130-6-9**] 07:25PM   GLUCOSE-120* UREA N-15 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-134 POTASSIUM-4.6 CHLORIDE-94* TOTAL CO2-28 ANION GAP-17 [**2130-6-9**] 07:25PM   WBC-17.9* RBC-4.23* HGB-11.0* HCT-33.9* MCV-80* MCH-25.9* MCHC-32.3 RDW-14.5 [**2130-6-9**] 07:25PM   PLT COUNT-561*  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2130-6-15**] 7:54 AM FINDINGS: There has been no change in the extent of opacification of the right hemithorax and left basilar atelectasis/consolidation.
A chest CT is recommended for further characterization.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST [**2130-6-10**] 3:59 PM 1) No definite evidence of pulmonary embolism on this limited exam.
Study Date of [**2130-6-11**]  11:29:32 PM ECG Regular narrow complex tachycardia - mechanism uncertain - consider AV nodal reentry Left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization changes Clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing for comparison   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 60 y/o man with PMH significant for mesothelioma transferred from OSH for management of hemothorax who was intubated for respiratory failure  #respiratory failure - likely from combination of progressive right sided hemothorax, progreessive lung cancer and right sided atelextasis, diffuse ground glass in lungs(CHF vs pneumonia) - tried diuresis with no improvement in respiratory status, likely not CHF - The patient was treated empirically for pneumonnia with Cefepime/Vanco/Flagyl.
#right sided hemothhorax s/p thoracentesis by IP - CT chest to assess size of hemothorax post tap:complete atelectasis RML and RLL from hemothorax, ground glass opacity in LLL - Thoracic surgery was consulted and felt the patient was not a candidate for pleurodesis.
#hyponatremia - likely from SIADH - will not fluid restrict since patient has terminal disease - sent for urine lytes .
