CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2158-11-6**] 8:03 AM 1.
Despite having a completely benign exam and a white blood cell count within normal, he did have an elevated creatinine and lowered systolic blood pressure.
An abdominal CT showed free air within the right upper quadrant with significant inflammation/stranding about the cecum/appendix and questionable distention of the right colon.
His abdominal exam also worsened at that point and general surgery was concerned about possible a perforated appendix, colonic ischemia secondary to the A-fib, or a perforation secondary to [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome; an exploratory laparotomy was suggested and discussed with the family who agreed and wished to proceed.
His pulmonary exam improved and begin to clear secretions much better throughout the remainder of his hospital course.
On [**2158-11-6**], a bedside swallowing study was performed for concerns of regurgitation possibly leading to aspiration; the study was within normal.
His INR was therapeutic and he was placed on 4mg of coumadin PO QHS; the INR is to be checked twice a week on Thursdays and Mondays and the coumadin dosage adjusted accordingly.
