He continues to take narcotics with fentanyl, percocet, and did not keep taking the laxative.
His abdominal CT on presentation demonstrated a slight increase in ascites, persistent small bowel dilatation and transition to decompressed bowel near the prior ventral incision area.
This was similar to his chest CT a few weeks prior.

Most Recent CXR ([**2108-2-13**]) - There has been a mild increase in opacification of the infrahilar right lower lobe, but not enough to call as pneumonia.
CTA Chest ([**2108-2-6**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head ([**2108-2-11**]) - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
HOSPITAL COURSE - Presented with nausea, abdominal pain, emesis, and inability to tolerate po intake.
CT scan was consistent with SBO.
He subsequently underwent exploratory laporotomy, with hope of seeing a small obstruction amenable to surgical treatment.
During his time on the surgery service, he also underwent a paracentesis, with removal of 2.5 liters.
CTA was performed because he did have a slight oxygen desaturation, and it was significant for a PE.
A CT of the head was performed and showed no acute process.
His O2 sats decreased and he was placed on a face tent, which improved his sats.
CXR showed no acute changes.
With respect to his DM, the patient's blood sugars were reasonably well-controlleed.
