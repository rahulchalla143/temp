Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system demonstrated two-vessel disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures, with an RVEDP of 22 mm Hg and a PCWP of 25 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was high at 8.9 L/min/m2.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
Final  angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
ECHO - TTE [**2126-5-20**] The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
