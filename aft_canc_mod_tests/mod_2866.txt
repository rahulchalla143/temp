In the ED, the patient was afebrile, HR in 150s with EKG showing sinus tachycardia.
Upon arrival to the medical inpatient floor, the patient's status declined and she developed HR 160-170s, SBP 80s, and worsening nausea and vomiting.
Corresponding ABG of 7.51/32/143/26 confirmed a healthy PaO2 level.
CXR was unremakable for any acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
Given PaO2 and clinical picture of patent airway without wheezes or clear distress the team decided not to intubate patient.

Hypotension: Patient's initial ED SBP of 80s-90s resolved s/p aggressive IVFs and lactate levels decreased.
By hospital day 2 the patient's blood pressures ranged between 110-130/60-80s and IVFs were discontinued and PO diet was initiated.
Systemic mastocytosis: The patient's acute episode was stabilized with the help of the allergy team's recommendations which included IV Solumedrol, Cromolyn and IV Benadryl.
She was monitored for any swelling of the airway and EKG changes.
Although patient denies any illness, blood and urine cultures were sent to rule out any underlying triggers for mastocytosis exacerbation.
Hypoxia: During acute phase of mastocytosis exacerbation desaturated to 60s on high flow face tent but PaO2 on ABG much more reassuring with levels >100.
Hallucinations and Agitation: After 2 days in hospital on high dose Solumedrol the patient experienced hallucinations and overt agitation most likely [**3-3**] high Solumedrol levels and perhaps complicated further by high Diphenhydramine amounts as well.
Patient remained afebrile throughout her stay and blood and urine cultures were sent.
When you first arrived you needed to be treated in the intensive care unit because your blood pressure was too low.
