# Altered Mental Status: Mrs [**Known lastname 69844**] had a Head CT that showed stable changes s/p resection.
She had no cough or infiltrate on CXR to suggest pneumonia.
She required continous fluid support, continous IVF of NS at 125cc/hr with periodic bolus of 1L over 2 hours PRN.
We reconfirmed the infection with UA positive and UCx + for Enterococcus.
Patient report baseline low BP 90-100's.
Notable for serum OSM is 283, Urine Osm is 496.
Imaging study suggest pulmonary vasculature and airway compromise by the tumor.
On CT scan, we noted the extend of the tumor and findings suggest a fungal ball in her LUL.
Interventional pulmonology recommended no intervention at this time.
We sent fungal markers which are pending at the time of discharge.
Patient's VSS, hemodynamically stable, no sign of infection, no + blood cultures.
Barium swallow was done to eval for extrinsic compression of the chest mass on the esophagus.
# s/p right frontal mass resection: CT head changes consistent with post-op peroid, no acute changes.
She therefore had a speech and swallow evaluation in coordination with a study of her esophagus.
