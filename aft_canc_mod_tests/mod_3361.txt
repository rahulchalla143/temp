The chest CT showed a loculated effusion with right middle lobe opacity.
Her white count was elevated with a shift to the left.
She is being admitted for an emypema with a plan to drain and culture fluid.

X-Rays: CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2146-10-17**] 2:50 AM  IMPRESSION: 1.
Final internal length is 47.5 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2146-10-29**] 11:43 AM  IMPRESSION: 1.
5-mm nodular density at the left base likely represents atelectasis, although attention to this area on followup studies is recommended.
Otherwise, no significant change from prior study with multiple paraesophageal and mediastinal lymph nodes again seen.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2146-10-30**] 1:40 PM No obvious pneumothorax.
She was seen by interventional pulmonary for a thoracentesis sent for culture and cytology which grew staph aureus sensitive to nafcillin.
On postoperative day #1 she was extubed and her white count trended downward from 26 to 12.4.
She was followed by serial chest x-rays that remained stable.
A chest CT without contrast was done on postoperative day #4.
The basal chest-tube was converted to a empyema tube.
A CT scan on [**10-25**] revealed anterior right pleural loculation.
A follow-up chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.
A follow-up chest CT on [**2146-10-29**] showed marked decrease in the size of the previously seen loculated right pleural collection with a small amount of persistent pleural fluid and gas noted.
Report to the [**Location (un) 470**] [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] Clinical Center Radiology Department for a Chest x-ray 45 minutes before your appointment.
