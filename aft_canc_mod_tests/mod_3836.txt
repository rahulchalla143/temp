TECHNIQUE: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast.
COMPARISON: Compared to CT from [**2130-8-7**] CT abdomen and pelvis.
CT PELVIS: The urinary bladder, uterus, and adnexa appear within normal limits.
Fluid collections are seen in the left posterior pararenal space, peri-lower [**Last Name (un) 103**] aorta graft and also just adjacent to the right iliac graft anastomosis.
Fluid collectiona around the graft as before.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
A CT scan obtained at [**Doctor First Name 794**] showed an infected AAA endograft.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She continued to have chronic lower abdominal pain so a CTA was obtained on [**2130-8-7**] which showed no graft leak and no intra-abdominal abscess collection, but she did have a stable fluid collection around the aortic graft that did not appear to be infected.
Another CT was obtained on [**2130-8-22**] that showed a stable periaortic fluid collection.
A psychiatric consultation was obtained at the patient's request due to concerns for depression.
Her SSRI was discontinued for possible Serotonin syndrome while on Linezolid.
Her TSH level was elevated at 30, but it was recommended that she stay on her current dose of levothyroxine 112mcg daily.
Cardiovascular: In the immediate post-operative course she did require a Neosynephrine drip to maintain adequate blood pressures but this was rapidly weaned off.
She is back to her baseline weight but does still complain of some dependent edema for which she continues the lasix.
Her hematocrit has remained stable in the 28-32 range and she has not required further transfusions.
Her blood sugars have been well controlled on sliding scale insulin.
Her infected AAA endograft was removed and cultures sent from the operating room.
Aortic tissue, periaortic fluid swab, and a piece of the endograft itself all grew VISA (Vanc Intermediate Staph Aureus).
Blood cultures drawn on [**2130-7-30**] also grew VISA.
Repeat blood cultures since then have been no growth.
A urine culture from [**2130-8-16**] grew Enterobacter and Pseudomonas.
A repeat urine culture was sent and this was no growth, so the Cipro was discontinued.
She is to have her CBC checked weekly to monitor for bone marrow suppresion.
A CTA was obtained on [**8-22**] to evaluate for an intra-abdominal abscess and this showed a stable fluid collection around the aorta and no identifiable cause of her fever.
