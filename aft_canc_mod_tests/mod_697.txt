STUDIES: GI BLEEDING STUDY   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 16282**] Reason: BRBPR, SIGNIFICANT DROP IN HCT, EVAL FOR SOURCE  Active intestinal bleeding within the first minute, with bleeding source located in ascending colon or cecum.
[**8-2**] A-gram Selective arteriograms of the SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and celiac artery were performed with no signs of active bleeding.
[**2133-8-4**] Colonoscopy Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Polyp in the sigmoid colon Fresh and clotted blood throughout the entire colon with evidence of active bleeding but without an identifiable source.
[**8-4**] A-gram Selective initial arteriogram of the SMA demonstrated highly suggestive area of active bleeding in the mid right colon.
Patient is on aspirin and at risk for PUD, however, seems unlikely he is having BRBPR from UGI source given this would require brisk bleed and patient is otherwise quite hemodynamically stable - monitor hct tid for now, decrease to daily or [**Hospital1 **] if stable and no additional bleeding - hold aspirin - maintain 2 large bore PIV, active T+X - maintain NPO for today.
He was transferred to the Surgical service and went to the OR on [**2133-8-4**] for Exploratory laparotomy with right colon resection.
His HCT remained stable at 25-26 and he was hemodynamically stable post-operatively.
