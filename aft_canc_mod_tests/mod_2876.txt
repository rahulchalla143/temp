CT torso: CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a markedly enlarged left pleural effusion occupying the majority of the left hemithorax, causing shift of the mediastinum rightward.
This limits detailed evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder wall is slightly thickened, as demonstrated on prior studies.
