Labs at this time demonstrated persistent acidemia, with ABG: 7.19/32/158/13.
Other labs drawn at this time as below - notable for worsening ARF (Cr 5.1), AG acidosis.
On arrival in the ICU, pt was noted to be tachypnic to 30-40's, O2 sats 90-100% on NRB, hypotensive with SBP 60's, tachycardic 180-210, and again, complained only of SOB.
Physical Exam: Vitals - T , HR 190, BP 73/37, RR 36, O2 99% on NRB -> AC/FiO2 1.0/TV 500/RR30/PEEP 5 Gen - awake, alert, able to answer questions, visibly tachypnic with use of abdominal muscles HEENT - scleral icterus Lungs - slight wheezing at bases, otherwise CTA b/l CVS - tachycardic, irregular Abd - soft, use of abdominal muscles with breathing, no noted tenderness to palpation; tympanic in upper region Ext - [**1-14**]+ LE edema b/l Neuro - A+O initially, became more lethargic Skin - cool extremities, flushed appearance to limbs   Pertinent Results: [**2116-8-8**] CXR - prelim read low lung volumes, ?
mild CHF [**2116-8-8**] Rpt CXR - prelim worsening CHF   Brief Hospital Course: This patient is a 60 yo male with h/o metastatic melanoma, who was undergoing IL-2 therapy (s/p 13 out of 14 doses), now with severe multi-organ failure; ?r/t to IL-2 toxicity.
There was a significant acidemia as well as CXR which indicated pulm edema.
An esophageal balloon was used to measure pleural pressures to aid in target CVP assessment.
# Atrial Fibrillation: No known history of CAD; the patient had afib on admission to ICU but converted to NSR after shocks x2 & amiodarone IVP x1; o/n, converted back to Afib, requiring cardioversion as well as amiodarone without success.
CT abd unremarkable for lactic acidosis or any ischemic process, however, clinical picture was consistent with shock liver.
Creatinine had elevated to ~5, also with multiple electrolyte abnormalities & in the setting of not wean vasopressors to keep MAP > 60.
# Severe Acidemia/AG-Acidosis:  The patient had severe lactic acidosis in the setting of hypotension SBP 60's on arrival to ICU & occasionally overnights, also with triple vasopressor use-vasoconstriction, ?abd compartment syndrome (however CT scan does not support this), shock or ischemic liver were also included in the differential.
Acid/base status and lactate levels were monitored.
Initially, mild transaminatis due to IL-2 therapy ?toxicity of IL-2.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be r/t IL-2 toxicity.
Received 4U FFP & Vit K x 1 dose.
On [**8-10**] INR values returned at 22.8 (from baseline 7) with fibrinogen < 35 and PTT > 150.
During the admission a high-dose insulin drip was started up to 23 units/hr for FS up to 600s; however, the patient became hypoglycemic with FS (60s).
They elected not to proceed with an autopsy or liver biopsy.
