She had peripheral blood cultures and cultures were drawn from her line.
She was repleted with 1000n/s +40meq KCL and 4gm.
Vital Signs: BP: 112/79.
On admission, she was noted for white blood count of 233,000 and a platelet count of 10,000.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy was notable for acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation.
The lumbar puncture showed no specific malignant cells, but high monocyte count was concerning for leptomeningeal spread and she received five doses of intrathecal chemotherapy, two doses of methotrexate, and three doses of ARC.
Her day 15 bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed no evidence of disease.
EGD was done which showed acute mild GVHD.
[**Known firstname **] and her husband stayed locally at the apartments for approximately two weeks after her discharge on [**2187-7-4**], which was on day 47 following her transplant.

There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-5-30**], a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion is now present.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2187-9-27**]: he estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-9-21**], findings are similar.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-9-27**], the pericardial effusion is slightly larger but there is no tamponade.
CT TORSO [**2187-9-25**]: 1.
CTA CHEST [**2187-9-29**]: 1.
[**2187-10-1**] CT CHEST: 1.
Dense consolidated left lower lobe on the prior study is replaced by atelectatis.
Infectious work-up was negative and her course was complicated by AFIB with RVR requiring admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Echo at that time showed a moderate pericardial effusion without e/o tamponade which was monitored on echo x 4 and remained stable until subsequently in course.
BP improved to baseline with volume resuscitation and PRBCs.
Echo at that time showed a moderate pericardial effusion without e/o tamponade.
She was noted to have a rapid heart rate (150) at that time.
She was given metoprolol 5mg IV x3 and on each occasion her HR did not change but her BP dropped to mid 80s.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the floor following normalization of her blood pressure with fluids and control of her heart rate with metoprolol.
Repeat echo on [**9-21**] and [**9-27**] demonstrated no change in the size or the distribution of her moderate-large pericardial effusions, which remained posterior and not amenable to drainage.
A CT torso was explored to evaluate the cause of her persistent fevers, and it demonstrated some mild pleural effusions and transverse/descending colitis.
GI was consulted and she underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**2187-9-27**] demonstrating diffuse erythema of the sigmoid [**Date Range 499**].
CXR demonstrated a post-expansion pulmonary edema and she was diuresed with slight improvement.
Following further respiratory distress, she again underwent CTA of the chest, which demonstrated worsened pleural effusions, with a moderate to large bilateral pleural effusion, in addition to diffuse bilateral upper lobe consolidations.
Ciprofloxacin was added to her antibiotics to enhance gram negative coverage, and her daptomycin was substituted for by linezolid for better pulmonary penetration.
Bronchoscopy was also undertaken.
Pleural fluid analysis demonstrated a transudative process.
Cultures were negative of the pleural fluid and BAL washings.
She underwent LP on [**2187-9-30**] to evaluate for leptomeningeal infiltration of her malignancy.
Her CSF analysis demonstrated leukcytosis to 32 with 92% lymphocytes.
Viral studies including adenovirus, [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus, enterovirus, CMV, HHV-6, EBV, HSV were all normal.
Pt with sudden decrease in compliance and increase in peak pressures on vent 9/24.
Head CT negative for acute change.
CTA did not show PE and showed mild improvement in ground glass opacities bilaterally but increase in size of pericardial effusion.
ECHO showed no evidence of tamponade and cardiology post-poned possible pericardiocentesis.
Repeat echo showed cardiac tamponade [**2-13**] pericardial effusions, which was tapped on [**10-19**] draining 800cc of pericardial fluid which was found to be + for AML.
Course further complicated by SVT requiring eletric cardioversion and amio ggt converted to PO amio, continued pressor dependence, skin impairments of the arms bilaterally with wound culture positive for coag + staph.
