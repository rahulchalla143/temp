His white count trended down over the next few days and he remained febrile until post op day 4.
He continued on iv abx and had a swallow study done on HD 5.
On HD 7 he had a video swallow and barium swallow that showed no esophageal leak and that patient would be okay to eat soft solids as long as he sat upright while eating.
