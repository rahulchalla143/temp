Evaluation during Mrs.[**Known lastname 69951**] initial admission with CTA showed bilateral proximal large PE's.
CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a moderate-size right pleural effusion with enlarged axillary lymph nodes measuring 2.5 cm on the left and 1.5 cm on the right.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was initiated on heparin therapy and underwent a left inguinal lymph node biopsy on [**2157-10-25**], which revealed high-grade large B-cell lymphoma with immunohistochemistry study strongly positive for BCL-2 and CD20.
Cells were also positive for CD19, CD10, and lambda light chain.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2157-10-25**] revealed no evidence for lymphoma.
Her LDH at diagnosis was 586.
She underwent a PET scan on [**2157-10-28**], which revealed intense uptake within bilateral axillary node, presternal node, pericardial node, bulky mesenteric mass consistent with matted lymphadenopathy along with some right iliac and bilateral inguinal nodes and some uptake within the subcutaneous region around the umbilicus.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent a PET scan after four cycles of her chemotherapy on [**2158-12-9**].
There was also significant improvement noted in the size of mesenteric mass with marked decrease degree of FDG uptake, although still with mild-to-moderate uptake noted.
A PET scan at the completion of treatment showed no FDG-avid disease.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] also had a Port-A-Cath in place which was not functioning.
In preparation for her chemotherapy for mobilization and stem cell collections and subsequent autologous transplant, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was seen in interventional radiology on [**2158-2-10**] for Port-A-Cath removal and IVC filter placement.
Her Port-A-Cath was also removed due to its nonfunctioning nature.
She tolerated this relatively well with some diarrhea, but developed profound pancytopenia as is expected requiring platelet and red cell transfusions.

All other culture data (-), CDiff [**3-22**] +, CDiff [**4-5**] (-), CDiff [**4-6**] (-)  CXR [**3-21**] - FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in sitting upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with a similar chest examination of [**2158-3-1**].
Heart size is unchanged and within normal limits.
LSpine xray - The vertebral bodies are intact and normally aligned with no evidence of compression fracture.
[**3-26**] - MRI spine - FINDINGS: No vertebral or paraspinal pathology is seen.
KUB [**3-31**] - No evidence of free intraabdominal air is noted.
Air is noted within the ascending [**Month/Year (2) 499**] and sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**] excluding a small bowel obstruction.
Small-sized air-fluid levels are noted within the small bowel.
[**4-8**] - CXR portable - FINDINGS: There is no significant change in the right subclavian line with tip in the SVC/RA junction.
Her abdominal pain seemed to improve after starting antibiotics, and days prior to her discharge, was significantly improved.
An xray was performed which showed no obstruction or free air, only occasional air fluid levels.
Abd/pelvic CT was negative for a concerning abdominal process.
(6) Back Pain: History and physical exam were most consistent with a muscle strain.
A xray of the lumbar spine was negative for compression fractures or other obvious etiology to explain her disease.
An MRI did show slight disc protrusions at L2/3 and L3/4 but no evidence of neural impingement.
(8) Left ICH/SDH: Patient fell and hit her head just prior to d/c home (with plt count of 18), suffered left parieto-occipital IPH and SDH.
Patient was confused and mildly disoriented post-fall (on [**4-12**]), but on [**4-13**] on way to CT scanner pt acutely decompensated and became non-responsive/only withdrawing to pain, and her CT showed increased size of bleed.
Patient was taken emergently to Or for L craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma; her post-op CT was not significantly changed, so she returned to the OR later that same day ([**4-13**]) for repeat evacuation.
The follow-up CT at this time showed decreased mass effect and midline shift.
On the morning of [**2158-4-18**], patient developed acute change in mental status, with progression from disorientation to unresponsiveness in the setting of hypertension fever, and hypoxia;   Repeat head CT x 2 was done on [**2158-4-18**], and showed no acute changes post her neurosurgery.
An LP was done which showed [**5-17**] WBC w/ lymphocyte predominance.
She had an EEG done on [**2158-4-18**] which showed spike waves in left frontal and temporal region c/w her prior bleeding.
MRI on [**2158-4-19**] showed left hemisphere swelling, but no acute ischemic changes.
Her mental status gradually improved from brainstem reflex only on the early morning of [**2158-4-18**] to withdraw to pain stimulus on mid morning of [**2158-4-18**], to opening eyes spontaenously, following commands, moving all extremities, said "hi" on morning of [**2158-4-19**], to able to speak a couple words, but continued expressive, Wernicke's type, aphasia on morning of [**2158-4-20**].
On [**2158-4-26**], the patient's neuro exam changed.
A repeat heat CT and MRI showed increasing size of the SDH compared to her scan on [**2158-4-18**].
She was given platelets to increase her platelet count from 70 to > 100.
She was transferred back to BMT service on [**4-29**] but a repeat CT scan on [**2158-5-1**] showed increasing size of the SDH and shift.
Her clinical exam was slightly improved to stable.
Her SBP was kept below 160 and her platelets were kept >80 at all times.
Her exam was improved.
Due to her aphasia, she was unable to communicate any specific discomfort.
Both an abdominal USN and abd/pelvic CT were done which did not reveal any pathology.
(11) Yeast UTI: urine cultures positive for 10K-100K yeast.
(12) Nutrition: Status post J-tube placement and tubefeeds (concentrated TFs to keep rate less than 40ml/hour; higher rates caused emesis.).
Chest Xray was consistent with volume overload and basilar atelectasis vs aspiration.
Repeat CXR with new infiltrate.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 ml IV EVERY SHIFT & PRN CVL with HX HIT 10 ml NS to each lumen every shift and PRN.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1.
