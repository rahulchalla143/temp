Chest X-Ray ([**2148-5-24**]): PA and lateral chest compared to [**2148-5-12**]: Tip of the left PIC catheter projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.
Microbiology: [**2148-5-24**] 3:30 pm URINE URINE CULTURE (Final [**2148-5-25**]):    NO GROWTH.
MRI head [**5-27**]: Findings of small vessel ischemic changes, unchanged from the prior examination.
Head CT [**6-15**]: No acute intracranial pathology to explain the patient's nausea identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old M with CLL d+8 of CEPP, s/p [**Hospital1 **] regimen and s/p recent admission for abdominal pain secondary to ileus, who is admitted for febrile neutropenia to 101F and increased dry cough.
Differential diagnosis included bacterial, fungal, viral infection given neutropenia.
CXR did not show any signs of an acute process.
Blood cultures were drawn and CMV viral load was obtainted.
A urine culture was negative.
CXR on [**5-28**] showed vol overload, but no overt infiltrate.
CT [**5-29**] showed: progression of multiple patchy nodular opacities associated with peribronchial thickening and ground-glass opacity predominantly in centrilobular distribution, most prominent in right middle lobe, involving both upper and lower lobes, worsened compared to the prior study, most likely worsening infectious process with persistent bilateral axillary, mediastinal, abdominal, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Bronchoscopy [**5-31**] showed PCP in BAL despite atovaquone prophylaxis, therefore pt.
Ambisome, cefipime, atovaquone, and vanco were d/c'd [**5-31**].
Patient with 4-5L O2 demand [**6-4**], also with shaking to 1 unit prbc's, blood stopped, sent to lab for transfusion reaction analysis but no evidence of reaction.
ABG showed 7.51/38/76 on 100% NRB.
He was transferred to the ICU for close observation and support, CXR suggested aspiration.
His oxygen requirement decreased and he was able to be weaned off O2.
Blood counts were low.
His WBC continued to be below 1000.
Demerol had been given for previous shakes, his HR was in the 120s, his BP was 160s/100's and he was diaphoretic.
An MRI of the head was performed on [**5-27**] to r/o CNS disease to explain somnolence, which was negative.
A repeat CT with contrast was done 7/22.06, also negative.
He had a head MRI [**5-27**] and a head CT [**6-15**] to look for central pathology contributing to nausea which were both negative.
He also had a speech therapy evaluation of swallowing to see if that might be contributing, which was notable for coordinated mastication and swallowing.
On admission, his Hct was below 25 and he was given 1 unit PRBCs with a good response.
His bilirubin was 3.1 on day 2, possibly due to transfusion, and repeat LFTs were drawn.
# Sleep Disordered Breathing: He has a history of sleep disordered breathing and has been on Bipap in the past but had not used his machine for 9 months prior to admission but his machine was tried [**6-5**] to improve sats while sleeping with minimal improvement prior to aspiration event, but it was not continued after this event.
