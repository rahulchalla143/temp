Red blood cell transfusion.
History of Present Illness: Patient is a 79 year old male with history of interstitial lung disease on oral prednisone taper (5-10 mg) at home, 3-4L nasal cannula oxygen at night at home, diastolic congestive heart failure, type two diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with recent NSTEMI, unresectable cholangiocarcinoma status-post ex-laparotomy with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy ([**2138-9-16**]) with positive margins, common bile duct excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node biopsy and percutaneous drain placement ([**2138-9-16**]) who was admitted to an outside hospital on [**10-26**] with fever, hypoxia, confusion thought to be PNA/CHF treated with levofloxacin and diuresis.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of possible abscess in setting of recent surgery, but CT abdomen was negative for abscess.
Patient was transferred from surgery to medicine on [**11-1**] after he was found to have hypoxia, with oxygen saturation of 70-80s on NC at transfer.
CXR showing increased effusion with increased haziness on right side.
EKG unchanged.
SBP 120s.
Family History: Father with DM, mother died at 97   Physical Exam: At time of admission to medical intensive care unit: GENERAL - well-appearing man in NAD, comfortable, appropriate HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits LUNGS - CTA bilat, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use HEART - PMI non-displaced, RRR, no MRG, nl S1-S2 ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs) SKIN - no rashes or lesions LYMPH - no cervical, axillary, or inguinal LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**6-16**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, steady gait   Pertinent Results: High resolution chest CT [**2138-11-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Recent changes over four days documented by conventional chest radiographs indicate that at least some of the reticular and ground-glass abnormalities in the lungs, which have worsened since [**10-29**] are pulmonary edema.
Ultrasound examination recommended if not already obtained.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-8-25**], no definite change.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old male with past medical history of type two diabetes mellitus, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease status post NSTEMI with recent diagonsis of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma status post common bile duct excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node biopsy, percutaneous drain placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia.
Given that he had been on long-standing steroids, and after a high-resolution CT was obtained as noted above, therapy for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn was initiated.
This was limited by borderline blood pressures with systolics in the 90's.
No improvement was noted with the above therapies, and the intensive care team was unable to wean Mr. [**Known lastname **] from 100% oxygen high-flow mask.
Culture data was unrevealing for an infection.
He required both high flow mask of 100% oxygen as well as 10 L nasal cannula, and was only able to maintain oxygen saturations in the 80's as of [**2138-11-11**].
The patient, along with his family, pastor, and friends, made the decision to not pursue intubation or resuscitation, as the patient understood that it was unlikely that he would be able to be weaned off of the ventilator should he be intubated.
