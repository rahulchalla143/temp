CT CHest / ABD from MICU: .
CT OF THE CHEST: A left-sided central venous catheter is seen with the tip terminating in the superior vena cava.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is no evidence of intraperitoneal air.
The liver, adrenal glands, spleen, and pancreas appear unremarkable on this non-contrast study.
The kidneys appear unremarkable on this non- contrast study and do not demonstrate any evidence of hydronephrosis.
CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter is seen within a non-distended bladder.
CXR .
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-5-21**] atrial fibrillation is new.
CXR .
Suction cath could not be passed.
Initial ABG 6.90/117/368.
Pt ventilated on AC 20X 300 P 10 FiO2 80% and repeat ABG 7.26/59/253.
She was started on vanco and zosyn for fever and leukocytosis that were stopped after two days as it was felt that the respiratory cultures were colonization.
There was a bronch done on [**2173-5-26**] which showed gummy secretions lining trach; tube significantly narrowed.
Her post-op CT showed pneumothorax, pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum, which was felt to have occured during her respiratory failure and forced oxygenation.
She had a repeat speech and swallow evaluation, which demonstrated that she was not safe to eat anything by mouth, with severe aspiration felt likely to be due to increased secretions.
Her lung exam was fairly benign, and CXR was not notable for any infiltrates.
The source of her fevers was unclear given that her UA/urine culture was negative for signs of infection, her CXR was fairly clear, and all blood cultures were negative for growth.
The pt did seem to indicate that she had some mild LUQ abdominal pain, so abdominal Xray was obtained to rule out dilated bowel or bowel wall thickening (which it was negative for these things).
She developed several loose stools after the MICU, and c.diif toxin was sent three times and returned negative each time.
Her heart rate decreased after receiving 3 liters of fluids.
#Anemia: Her hematocrit was stable during this admission without any need for transfusions.
Your liothyronine dose has been increased 2) Call your doctor or return to the ER for worsening shortness of breath or stridor, fever, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms 3) Please keep all follow up appointments as scheduled 4) You will need to have a repeat speech and swallow evaluation to determine if you can have your trach capped to speak or eat once your secretions are less.
