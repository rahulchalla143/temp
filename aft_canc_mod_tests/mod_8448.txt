These findings were discussed with the ordering physician, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], on date of exam shortly after exam acquisition.
The pleural lesions appear stable when compared to prior chest x- rays however in combination with nodule and patient's history, a 3- month followup non- contrast chest CT is recommended.
