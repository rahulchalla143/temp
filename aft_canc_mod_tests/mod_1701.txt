Aortic thrombus and occlusive thromboembolism of the left axillary artery discussed immediately after completion of the scan at 2:40 a.m. with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of surgery.
[**2166-3-8**] ECHO Pt is intra-op for embolectomy of left arm  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %).
[**2166-3-11**] Chest/Coronary CTA A cardiac CTA was performed on this 63-year-old gentleman to evaluate the coronary arteries prior to aortic surgery for an intraluminal mass in the aortic arch.
The examination was performed after 0.4 mg of nitroglycerin and an additional 5 mg of metoprolol.
The heart rate was approximately 63 beats per minute.
The functional images are not satisfactory because of motion.
The cardiac output, however, did appear to be satisfactory and there was no abnormal wall motion.
Although the study is less than ideal there would not appear to be significant disease throughout the arterial tree.
[**2166-3-12**] ECHO The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Bilateral upper lobe scarring and subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, better assessed on the [**2166-1-4**] torso CT at which time findings were felt to be unchanged since [**2158-1-3**].
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4343**]   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the surgery service for post operative evaluation and treatment from a laparoscopic proctectomy, j-pouch, handsewn coloanal anstomosis, diverting ileostomy  on[**3-3**]; for details, please see operative note.
IV Heparin was started and CTA revealed a left axillary thrombus which was occlusive and an aortic arch thrombus.
On POD1 his chest tube were removed and anticoagulation was begun.
His INR will be followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8682**].
