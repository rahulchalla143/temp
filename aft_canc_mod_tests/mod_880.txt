ACTIVE # Acute Kidney Injury: Patient was admitted with a creatinine of 7.2 secondary to obstructive uropathy from compression by peritoneal metastases.
Patient underwent placement of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes by IR [**2147-12-19**], and nephrouretheral stents on [**2147-12-22**], after which the patient's Cr trended down to 1.3.
Urine cultures from L nephrostomy tube grew MSSA, prompting antibiotic treatment with 5d augmentin and 14d doxycycline.
After 1wk abx, repeat culture was negative and the L tube was capped.
