Echo reportedly revealed cardiac tamponade.
Also had CT at OSH which revealed a moderate pericardial effusion, mult.
body (?mets), T11-12 ?mets, and possible right lobe liver mets.

Rare atypical epithelioid cells - cannot exclude carcinoma; numerous pulmonary macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells, and squamous cells.
Areas of signal abnormality in the T3, T7, and T10 vertebral bodies are most consistent with hemangiomas when correlated with the bone scan and CT findings.
Incompletely visualized left-sided lung masses, and reference should also be made to the CT of the torso for further evaluation of these.
[**2181-5-8**] CT Chest: CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Non-dependent loculated left pleural effusion has evolved in the interval.
Evaluation for mediastinal and hilar adenopathy is limited on this non- contrast study.
CT ABDOMEN: Evaluation of intra-abdominal organs is limited due to the lack of intravenous contrast.
CT PELVIS: The bladder is not distended.
BONE WINDOWS: Destruction of the vertebral body at T12 is again noted, as seen on a recent thoracic MR study of [**2181-5-3**].
Upon admission she had an Echocardiogram which showed a large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
However, on CT Torso done on [**5-8**], pericardial effusion was noted and reported as unchanged.
A stat bedside echo was done which showed a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
Repeat echocardiogram on [**5-14**] showed stable pericardial effusion.
The CT scans at the OSH show multiple metastic lesions in lungs, spine(T6/11/12), and small lesion in liver.
The heme/onc service was consulted and recommended bone scan, tumor markers, and a biopsy of tissue for diagnosis.
Pt had tumor markers checked - CA 27.29: 43, CEA: 13.
Pt had Bone scan [**2181-5-2**] which showed lesions in L1 vertebral body and right posterior 5th rib concerning for metastatic disease.
She had an MR thoracic spine shows T 12 met which does not break into cord, no conus or cord involvement seen.
The interventional pulmonology service was consulted and attempted a biopsy of her lung mass.
Interventional radiology was consulted for CT guided transthoracic biopsy, however, when the patient went down for the procedure she was noted to be tachycardic and had INR of 1.5.
On [**5-10**], neuroradiology performed biopsy of T12 lesion.
The neurology service was consulted and recommended MRI/MRA of her head which showed vessels in the neck without stenoses, subacute infarct again visualized in region of PCA.
Pt had had recent TEE without signs of endocarditis and a repeat TTE which did not show clots.
Pt had a lipid panel which showed LDL <70 without medications, ASA 325mg was continued.
A repeat CT head showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage and an evolving left PCA territory subacute infarct.
Per neurology recommendations, heparin gtt was started with low goal and close monitoring of mental status.
Neuro exam remained unchanged.
An MRI orbit was done.
# C. diff: With regard to her C.difficile colitis- pt was initially continued on Flagyl, however, her white count continued to trend up.
PO Vancomycin was added to her antibiotic regimen and her white count remained stable.
She remained on PO amiodarone (weaned from 400 [**Hospital1 **] to 200 [**Hospital1 **]) and beta blockers (weaned to 25mg TID [**1-12**] low BP) with heart rates in the 100s-110s.
# Pleural effusion: With regard to her Left pleural effusion- lasix IV prn was used for diuresis.
She underwent thoracentesis in an effort to help tachypnea - but removing fluid did not improve RR or O2 sat.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-12**] Sprays Nasal PRN (as needed).
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
HR 110s-120s.
Metastatic lesions were found on CT scan and an extensive work up was done to determine where the primary site was, however no primary malignancy was found.
