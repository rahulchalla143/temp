negative staph bacteremia: on [**7-1**], blood cultures were sent from patient's a-line with 2 out of 2 positive for coag.
She subsequently underwent further imaging with thyroid ultrasound and parathyroid scan which showed a large left parathyroid adenoma.
She subsequently underwent contrasted CT neck and torso to better characterize the tumor involvement.
Her previous left thyroidectomy and parathyroid adenoma resection operative reports and surgical pathology from [**Hospital3 3287**] were reviewed among her inpatient and outpatient endocrinologists, surgery, and radiology.
Postoperatively, pt was monitored with daily serum PTH measurements and q6--8hr serum calcium checks.
Calcium was downward trending  and had dropped to 8.9 on discharge.
#Respiratory failure: After extubation from surgery, patient developed respiratory distress with O2 sat approaching 60% and hypotension with BP 80s/50s.
CXR did not show worsening pulmonary edema.
Exam consistent with right-sided failure at admission (JVD, LE edema) and repeat echocardiogram showed non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and EF = 25%.
However, her lasix was held on the day of the CT neck/torso for renal protection given the contrast load, and the rate of the fluid was decreased slightly to avoid acute exacerbation.
Her CT neck/torso revealed pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and anasarca.
She was restarted on 40 mg PO Lasix and 6.25 mg PO carvedilol, but her blood pressure dropped to the 80's, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
Her baseline SBP was ranging 80's-100's.
Patient has a baseline creatinine of around 1.2.
Her creatinine was up to 1.8  on admission.
Lasix was held on the day of her CT neck/torso given contrast dye being a nephrotoxin.
Creatinine stable at 1.5 on discharge.
negative staph bacteremia: on [**7-1**], blood cultures were sent from patient's a-line with 2 out of 2 positive for coag.
Her INR on admission was 1.1.
Patient was monitored on telemetry during hospital course.
She is discharged on her home anti-diabetic agents except for metformin given her kidney disease and Cr 1.5 on discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -daily Ca and PTH for 5 days after discharge -fax results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital1 **] -follow up with surgery as directed -Full code -Coumadin restarted -> continued INR monitoring as outpt -home carvedilol 6.25 mg PO BID and furosemide 40 mg PO daily were discontinued due to borderline blood pressure (SBP 80's-90's) after aggressive diuresis, may need to restart   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 1726**] Bay Skilled Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Hospital1 3983**]                               [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5451**] MD [**MD Number(2) 5452**]  Completed by:[**2134-7-11**
