Extraluminal pooling of contrast are concerning for active intra- tumoral hemorrhage in the most inferiorly located tumor mass in the right hepatic lobe.
A targeted ultrasound of this area is recommended for further evaluation of possible intra- tumoral hemorrhage vs. venous lakes.
Infusion of D10W then D10 1/2NS was started, and as hypoglycemia resolved, his lactate acidosis improved.
Goal blood sugar is between 70-100.

The patient's Hct was 18 on admission, and he subsequently received pRBCs to increase Hct to high 20s.
* Hepatic adenomas: known multiple adenomas per CT scan report.
INR remained elevated around 1.6-1.7, suggesting underlying synthetic dysfunction.
