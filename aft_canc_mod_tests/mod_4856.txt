She was evaluated with an upper endoscopy on [**2106-8-27**], at which time a submucosal mass in the stomach was noted.
She then had a CT angiography of the abdomen and a CT of the pelvis on [**2106-10-8**].
Given the nonspecific nature of these findings, a CT guided omental biopsy was performed on [**2106-10-13**].
GYN HISTORY:  Last Pap smear and mammogram were both recently normal.
Bimanual and rectovaginal examination was limited by body habitus.
1) Heme: The pt's low hematocrit stabilized after 2 additional transfusions of 2 units PRBC's each, and was thought to be dilutional gvien a fluid excess of 12L.
On POD #6, the patient underwent a CT of the abdomen for evaluation of fever, and an intrahepatic IVC thrombus was discovered incidentally.
On repeat CT scan [**11-22**], the thrombus was not visualized.
2) ID: The pt had post-operative fevers, for which blood cultures were obtained.
Other cultures from [**11-5**], 13, 14, 15 all showed no growth, therefore the c. perfringens was thought to be a contaminant.
She underwent a CTA of the chest which showed no pulmonary emboli but did show bilateral upper lobe opacities concerning for pneumonia.
She was started on levofloxacin, and repeat chest x-ray showed that her pneumonia improved after 4 days of levofloxacin, and this was discontinued.
Given continued temperatures, CTs of the abdomen were obtained [**11-8**], [**11-12**] which showed increasing carcinomatosis and multiple pelvic pockets of free fluid, some loculated, which were thought to be malignant ascites; none amenable to percutaneous drainage.
Repeat CTA [**11-12**] was again negative for PE.
However, on CT scan [**11-22**], the patient was noted to have a small bowel obstruction, associated with some nausea and vomiting.
