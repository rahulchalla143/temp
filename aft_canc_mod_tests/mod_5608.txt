LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Preoperative laboratories showed a BUN and creatinine of 40/1.6, hematocrit of 35, and a urinalysis with 135 red blood cells per high-powered field.
The patient had a preoperative stress test which showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia.
His echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.
He was monitored by a Swan-Ganz catheter.
This was especially high approximately one week postprocedure when the ostomy output dropped to zero and the right JP output was subsequently approximately 2,500.
The JP output subsequently decreased; however, was still putting out on the order of close to 1,000 a day.
A CT urogram was obtained on postoperative day number six which showed no ureteral leak.
The Foley catheter was thus removed; however, it was again noted that the ostomy output was decreasing so this was replaced again.
Creatinine of both drains in the ostomy showed the creatinine of the ostomy to be 70, the creatinine of the right drain 39 and the creatinine of the left JP to be 1.1.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a rule out MI protocol immediately postoperatively which showed elevated CKs up to 6,000; however, his CK MB was 22 for an MB index of 0.4.
Lopressor and Hydralazine were used to control his blood pressure.
On postoperative day number eight, he experienced postprandial epigastric discomfort which resolved with Tums; however, given his significant cardiac history and diabetic history, a second rule out MI protocol was performed which showed nonspecific T wave inversions in V1 through V3; however, his enzymes were negative.
