Subsequent pathology demonstrated it to be papillary renal cell carcinoma.
During the procedure there was a reported 1 liter blood loss while the renal artery was clamped.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit with an epidural.
Subsequently the patient was found to be hypotensive with a blood pressure of 70/30 and a heart rate of 90.
The patient was bolused and subsequent enzymes were significant for a CK of 1170, MB of 79, index of 6 and a troponin of 19.
Electrocardiogram showed V2 and V3 segment depression.
Arterial blood gas at 12/12 was 7.38, 36, 56.
The subsequent hospitalization was complicated by a left lower lobe consolidation and a sputum notable for MRSA and increasing O2 liter requirement.
A subsequent bedside swallow study on [**1-5**] was noted for aspiration.
MRI of the head on [**1-6**] showed no intracranial hemorrhage and no stenosis or carotid bifurcation and chronic periventricular white matter changes.
PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  On [**1-6**] his white blood cell count was 13, hematocrit 34.5, platelets 402.
Electrolyte panel sodium 149, K 4.1, chloride 110, bicarb 29, BUN 25, creatinine 1.3, glucose 180, calcium 7.9, phosphate 3.1, magnesium 2.4, Vancomycin level was subtherapeutic.
Urinalysis on [**12-31**] negative blood, red blood cells of 11.
Blood cultures from [**12-31**] was notable for no growth.
Urine culture from [**12-31**] was notable for no growth.
Electrocardiogram from [**12-29**] showed ST segment depressions in V2 and V3.
Echocardiogram showed an EF of greater then 50% focal wall motion abnormalities, mild LA, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, mild left ventricular systolic function.
Pathology from [**12-29**] showed papillary renal cell carcinoma changes consistent with diabetic glomerulosclerosis and multiloculated cystic structure.
Sputum from [**12-31**] showed heavy growth, gram negative diplococci, gram positive cocci.
Radiology, x-ray from [**1-7**] showed nasogastric tube, no pneumonia.
X-ray from [**1-6**] showed a left lateral pleural thickening versus loculated effusion, right PICC, scattered discoid atelectasis.
MRI of the head on [**1-6**] showed negative MR, intracranial, negative stenosis, carotid bifurcation negative, territorial infarct, chronic paraventricular white matter changes.
Video swallow study from [**1-6**] showed penetration with silent aspiration, moderate to severe oropharyngeal dysphagia.
MRI kidney, abdominal imaging [**12-5**] showed a 2 by 1 by 1.5 by 1.8 right upper pole posterior mass pancreatic cyst.
CT of the abdomen [**11-10**] had shown a positive mass in the right kidney.
TTE from [**7-21**] showed an left ventricular of 80%, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Of note, the patient had a dobutamine stress echocardiogram performed on [**2166-12-15**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia rate 160 to 170 BPM.
The patient's creatinine remained relatively stable throughout the remainder of his hospitalization course.
Creatinine varied between 1.2 and 1.4.
We suggest continued outpatient monitoring of the patient's ins and outs as well as his creatinine level.
Of note, blood cultures were always negative.
The patient's ENT evaluation showed global function with incomplete epiglottis detection, premature spillage and silent aspiration.
finger sticks and electrolytes q three days, CBC q three days to monitor creatinine and electrolyte function.
