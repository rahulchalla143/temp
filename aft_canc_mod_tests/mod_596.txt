The patient was evaluated for pulmonary embolism by CT angiogram which was negative with only slight increase in the right pleural effusion and atelectatic changes.
On the morning of admission, the patient saw Dr. [**Name (NI) **], reporting worsening shortness of breath, increased O2 requirements from 1.5 to 4 liters, decreased O2 saturations from the mid-90s to the low 90s and increased heart rate above 100.
An echocardiogram of the lungs was done showing no change in pleural effusions and the patient was referred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for transthoracic echocardiogram.
The echocardiogram revealed a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion with a right atrial collapse and a right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired filling and tamponade.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs upon admission, temperature maximum of 97.7 F.; heart rate of 104 to 109; blood pressure of 121/89, nap of 102; respiratory rate of 30; pulses 16, 128/112.
The patient's O2 saturation is 92 to 97 on four liters.
Lung examination with decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the bases, right greater than left, crackles half way up the right side and a third of the way up the left side.
Dullness to percussion bilaterally, right greater than left; no wheezes.
Cardiovascular examination with increased heart rate; normal S1, split S2.
Pulses at 16.
Her abdominal examination with normoactive bowel sounds.
LABORATORY DATA:  On [**8-18**], white blood cell count 6.9, hematocrit of 39.2, platelets of 353.
Sodium 136, potassium 3.9, chloride 99, carbon dioxide 25, BUN 15, creatinine 0.4, glucose 104, calcium 9.1.
Alkaline phosphatase 91, AST 24, ALT 14, albumin 3.4, FSH 91.
Blood cultures negative.
CT angiogram in the Emergency [****], showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus, slight interval increase in right pleural effusion with left loculated atelectatic changes.
A [**8-20**] lung ultrasound showing no change in pleural effusion.
Transthoracic echocardiogram showing left ventricular systolic function, mildly decreased septal hypokinesis, moderate to large pericardial effusion, right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse consistent with impaired filling or tamponade.
On [**8-20**], white blood cell count 5.7, hematocrit 37.5, platelets 329, potasium 4.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   In brief, the patient is a 48 year old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer status post two recent admissions for bilateral malignant pleural effusions, bilateral pleurodesis requiring home O2 and bi-PAP, now presenting with progressively worsening shortness of breath times one week and transthoracic echocardiogram consistent with pericardial effusion.
Cardiovascular:  The patient with an echocardiogram consistent with pericardial effusion.
Right ventricular pressure of 33/15, P- a pressure of 35/17, wedge of 21.
Cardiac output 5.3, cardiac index 3.2.
Miss [**Known lastname 16968**] had an EKG upon admission which showed no evidence of electrical alternans and EKG upon discharge which also showed no evidence of electrical alternans.
An EKG showed some elevation in PR interval in AVR.
A follow-up echocardiogram was done revealing normal ejection fraction 45 to 50% and no evidence of pericardial effusion.
It is recommended that the patient have a follow-up echocardiogram to evaluate any further re-accumulation of pericardial fluid.
