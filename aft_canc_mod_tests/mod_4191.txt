WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2147-8-9**]):       STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Blood cultures: [**7-30**], [**7-31**], [**8-1**], [**8-2**], [**8-3**]: negative .
Outside Hospital blood cultures [**2147-7-30**] ([**Hospital 24356**] hospital): Group C strep and Fusobacterium.
............... CXR [**2147-7-30**]: 1.
CXR [**2147-8-7**] Bilateral opacities demonstrate interval improvement.
............... TTE [**2147-7-31**]: Atrial and ventricular size, heart wall thickness, valves, cardiac index and systolic function all normal.

CT chest [**2147-8-7**] 1.
Multifocal upper lobe ground-glass opacities are unchanged since previous imaging and likely due to residual foci of infection.

His hemodynamics and respiration improved and he was weaned off pressors and extubated on [**8-5**].
# polymicrobial bacteremia: Blood cultures at [**Hospital 24356**] Hospital grew group C strep (Strep milleri) and Fusobacterium.
Blood cultures in our institution were negative.
As for possible sources/foci of infection, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a LLL pneumonia with growth of group C strep from sputum; He had 2 small RUE abscesses with rare culture growth of coag negative staphylococci from drained content; He also had pus draining from his ear with growth of pan sensitive CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX and coagulase negative staphylococci.
A TTE was obtained with clear visualization of the cardiac valves which showed no evidence of endocardial vegetations and repeated blood cultures were, as already mentioned, negative.
These were later modified per culture sensitivities to Unacyn.
Repeated Chest CTs also demonstrated a small loculated left lower pleural collection which was initially suspected to represent empyema or a complex exudative effusion.
Interventional Pulmonology and Cardio-Thoracic Surgery consults were obtained, the collection was deemed too small for percutaneous drainage and, in-light of the patient's clinical improvement and stable condition, a conservative approach was advocated with continued Abx treatment and follow-up CT 2 weeks post discharge.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] will be followed in the outpatient [**Hospital 87440**] clinic with the results of his f/u thoracic CT scan.
# Ear infection - Mr. [**Known lastname **] had drainage of Pus from his ear which resolved with systemic antibiotics.
Cultures were positive for CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX and coagulase negative staphylococci.
Later otoscopic exams revealed bilateral Otitis Media W/ Effusion which was attributed to his intubation and supine posture.
No clinical signs of mastoiditis were observed and CT scan of the head and temporal bones was negative for mastoiditis/bone destruction.
# RUE abscesses: 2 small abscesses in RUE were identified on clinical examination and corroborated by RUE US, one of these was incised and drained pussy content with many WBC but no bacteria per gram stain and rare growth of coag negative staphylococci in culture; The tract was left open for secondary healing which proceeded without complication.
#Transaminitis and elevated INR:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had mild elevations of AST, ALT, ALKP and INR during his hospital course.
Liver functions trended down on subsequent follow-up and the transient elevation was thought to be most likely drug induced or a reflection of mild shock liver.
Liver functions and INR will continue to be followed in the out patient setting until complete normalization.
#acute renal failure - Mr. [**Known lastname **] initially presented with Creatinin and BUN levels of 3.2 and 91 respectively.
His total fluid balance was positive 6000-7000 ml upon graduation from the ICU.
On the medicine floor he was adequately hydrated orally and had good urine output and stable normal renal function.
His stool guaiacs were negative and he had no signs or symptoms of bleeding or hemolysis.
His blood counts later recovered and he had a Hct of 11.7 and a mild thrombocytosis of 532 on discharge.
Clonidine was not renewed due to his recent history of hypotension and borderline blood pressures.
As you were very sick you were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit where you were treated intravenous fluids and antibiotics to increase your blood pressure and fight the infection.
With the above treatment your condition steadily improved, your blood pressure stabalized and you were able to breath on your own and be disconnected from life support.
You will need to have another chest CT and be followed by our chest surgeons inorder to make sure that the pocket of infection near your left lung resolves.
You should also keep the appointments for a hearing test and an ear doctor specialist that we have arranged for you.
A multi-vitamin pill that you should continue to take once a day.
