[**2179-1-4**] CXR :Region of consolidation in the axillary left upper lobe which developed between [**1-2**] and [**1-3**] is still present as are larger regions of heterogeneous opacification in both lower lungs, all strongly suggestive of widespread pneumonia, particularly the findings in the left lung since esophagectomy typically entails considerable right basal atelectasis.
**FINAL REPORT [**2179-1-8**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2179-1-8**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he had a barium swallow done which confirmed no anastomotic leak and he subsequently began a liquid diet.
On [**2179-1-7**] he developed several episodes of diarrhea and a stool for c difficile was sent which was negative.
His WBC was 10K and he remains afebrile.
