Cardiogenic shock 2.
She was hypotensive and a chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.
Computerized tomography scan was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism given the history of breast cancer.
The patient had a history of allergy to Shellfish and computerized tomography scan was ultimately negative for pulmonary thrombosis, but the patient became acutely more short of breath and bronchospastic.
Hematocrit dropped from 41.6 to 34.4.
She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and a repeat hematocrit was 38.3.
Vital signs, temperature 100.0, heartrate 100, blood pressure 102/66, respirations 12, 100% oxygenation.
Cardiovascular, tachycardiac, S1 and S2, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the apex.
LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count 22.9/31.9/217 with neutrophils 88%.
Chemistry 137/4.2/103/22/25/0.9/147/ 8.2/4.9/3.2.
Arterial blood gases 7.42/35/115 on 40% fIO2.
Creatinine kinase 108, MB 4 and troponin 2.0.
Chest x-ray reveals mild congestive heart failure with question of a right middle lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram is sinus rhythm, ST depression in V3 and 4 with T wave flattening in the lateral leads.
From a gastrointestinal standpoint, the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed on [**2144-12-28**] which revealed blood in the fundus and multiple small lesions are actively bleeding.
Her saturations remained above 95% on face mask.
The patient was premedicated for cardiac catheterization given her possible allergic reaction to intravenous dye.
Cardiac catheterization revealed 3 to 4+ mitral regurgitation with an ejection fraction of 65%.
The patient also had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia with a rate of 200 and then converted back to sinus rhythm with a total of 10 mg of intravenous Lopressor.
The patient's rate remained uncontrolled and blood pressure began to drop.
Heartrate was between 120 and 150 with a blood pressure maintained in the 100s/60s.
Saturations were 97% on room air.
Lowest blood pressure drop was 80/60.
They also recommended obtaining echocardiogram prior to discharge to assess the left ventricular function as well as mitral valve function.
Echocardiogram was obtained on [**2145-1-6**] which revealed still some mild to moderate mitral regurgitation as well as significant left ventricular outflow obstruction due to the mitral leaflets.
Left ventricular function remained greater than 60%, the effect was hyperdynamic.
