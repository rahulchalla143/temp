He noticed very dark urine and reported to a local hospital where he was noted to have a platelet count of 20K (normal bun and creatinine).
By report, the OSH ED performed a CTA chest to evaluate for pulmonary embolism, which was negative.
He also had an ultrasound of his right hip and thigh, which did not show any clot.
His labs were drawn, and given his continued bleeding, Pt was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation and likely inpatient admission.
Labs were significant for platelet count of 30 and fibrinogen <35, INR 1.8, PTT 43.9, PT 19.2.
Hct 34.4 from a baseline of 39-41.
WBC 10.9 (74% N, 4% bands), Creatinine 1.1, Uric acid 5.0, LDH 1215, LFTs otherwise normal (Tbili 0.6, Dbili 0.2).
Of note, patient's platelets were last 146 on [**2133-1-12**], and his LDH has always been in the 200s.
On arrival to the ICU, vitals were: 36.7C, HR 93, BP 118/71, RR 12, Sat 94% on RA.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical: 36.7C, HR 93, BP 118/71, RR 12, Sat 94% on RA.

[**2-15**]: MSSA [**2134-2-17**] negative [**2039-2-21**], pending  Pathology: [**2133-2-20**] bone marrow biopsy (preliminary): extensive metastatic melanoma; no hemosiderin-laden macrophages suggestive of hemophagocytosis  Studies: CXR [**2133-2-12**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest read in conjunction with CT scan of the chest, [**2-9**]: Nearly cm rounded opacity in the left mid lung has developed from what was previously a 2-cm wide opacity with surrounding hemorrhage in the lingula on the chest CT performed [**2-9**].
The CT also shows patient has had a wedge biopsy from the left lower lobe and has a small non-serous fluid collection in the left major fissure.
Renal u/s [**2133-2-12**]: IMPRESSION:  No definite renal mass lesion identified.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CXR line placement [**2133-2-12**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 4:11 a.m.: New right PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
CT scan might be helpful in differentiating among these.

[**2133-2-19**] Radiology CT Chest, ABD & PELVIS W/O CON IMPRESSION: 1.
Reidentified is thickening of the right iliacus and right internal obturator muscles, compatible with the patient's known hematoma, no gross change is seen from prior MR examination from [**2133-2-15**].
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2133-2-26**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Right upper lobe consolidation has minimally improved.
# DIC: Labs on admission consistent with DIC-- thrombocytopenia, anemia, low fibrinogen, elevated INR/PT, high D-dimer and fibrin degradation products.
Smear on admission was negative for schistocytes, no evidence of TTP.
Urine culture was negative, and initial blood culture negative.
He was observed in the ICU and transfused with cryoprecipitate for goal fibrinogen 100, PRBC's for Hct 25, and platelets for goal of 50 given active bleeding.
# Anemia: Throughout ICU stay, patient required frequent blood transfusions to keep hct >21.
Etiology seemed to be consistent with blood loss anemia through his GU tract (see "hematuria" below) as well as bleeding/hematomas in his thighs seen on CT and MRI scans.
Direct coombs was sent and was negative.
Repeat blood smear showed some nucleated red cells and giant platelets, but few schistocytes.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2-20**] showed extensive melanoma, with no evidence of hemophagocytosis (ferritin 4000).
Pt's Hct was more stable over the later part of his hospitialization, as he initially required 3-4 units daily for several days but this eventually decreased to [**2-9**] units daily.
CT scan on admission did not show any reason for bleeding, only small foci of parenchymal hemorrhage in the kidneys.
While it was difficult to assess urine output due to CBI, he appeared to be anuric.
Renal US did not show clot causing obstruction and hydronephrosis.
His creatinine and BUN continued to increase during his off dialysis days, and renal consult team felt that it would likely be several weeks to months before he would recover any meaningful renal function (if ever).
No further labs were checked.
Pelvic MRI showed diffuse marrow infiltration, new mass in iliacus muscle that may represent another met.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2133-2-20**] showed very extensive infiltration of his bone marrow with melanoma.
# Fevers / MSSA bacteremia:  Pt was febrile on [**2-15**] and blood cultures later revealed MSSA, thought to be due to infected L EJ IV site which was purulent and also grew MSSA.
However, Pt had a CT abdomen, which showed a possible RUL pneumonia, and antibiotics were switched to vancomycin and cefepime.
TTE showed a possible 2mm lesion on the aortic valve but no significant regurg or stenosis of any valve and hyperdynamic LV activity.
Several surveillance blood and urine cultures were negative afterwards, but the Pt did become mildly febrile on [**2-23**]-18.
Given metatstatic disease, MRI pelvis was ordered, which showed diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow with metastatic disease, and enlargement of the right iliacus and the right internal obturator muscles, which appears to be due to bleeding.
Unable to obtain bladder pressure due to 3-way foley.
Given persistent and worsening pain, CT abd/pelvis again obtained which showed hematoma of right iliacus muscle, likely contributing to worsened belly and back pain, but no significant enlargement relative to prior.
Neuro exam normal, so head CT to r/o bleed deferred.
