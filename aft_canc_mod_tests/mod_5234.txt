It was substantially worse than the chest pain that initiated his previous hospitalization.
Thrombectomy was successful, and resolution of the thrombus revealed an 80% "ostial" lesion at the antegrade limb of the PDA at its touchdown and a critical 90% lesion in the retrograde limb.
Final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection, no perforation, and no embolization.
Post cath transferred to [**Hospital1 **] service chest pain free in stable condition.
Physical Exam: Blood pressure was 135/64 mm Hg while seated.
Pulse was 68 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, with O2 sat 98% on room air.
His skin exam is remarkable for diffuse neurofibromas.
The neck was supple with JVP of 5 cm.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th intercostal space, mid clavicular line.
Inspection and palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue was remarkable for diffuse neurofibromas.

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2119-3-8**] demonstrated: 1.
Graft angiography revealed an occluded thrombosed SVG-PDA graft.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a mildly elevated mean PCPW of 14mmHg and a normal cardiac index of 2.37 l/min/m2.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation.
