His physical exam was notable for diffuse wheezes, and he was coughing.
There was concern for PE given tachypnea, but his creatinine was elevated so he was not a candidate for CTPA.
The decision was made to attempt a CT head to assess for metastatic cancer prior to empirically starting heparin, but the patient became acutely agitated.
His oxygen saturation has been in the high 90's throughout his stay in the ED.
His respiratory rate was elevated to 30-40.

PE also less likley given excellent oxygenation saturation on room air.
Othe vital signs were stable, not tachycardic or hypotensive, satting 99-100% on RA.
He was evaluated with a CXR which was unremarkable.
ABG was reasurring and lactate was not elevated.
Patient appears to be tachypneic at baseline with RR 20s-30s, satting well on room air.
His creatinine improved with IVFs during his hospital course.
T  #Enteroccocus UTI- The patient was  treated with a  7 day course of ampicillin  # Nutrition- The patient had a bedside speech and swallow evaluation on [**10-10**] and was  recommended patient to be NPO for prevention of prandial aspiration.
Re-evaluation  on [**10-13**] recommended continued NPO status except for meds crushed in purees.
there was concern for aspiration, although a CXR showed no evidence of aspirate in the lungs.
He was re-evaluated by speech and swallow therapy with a video oropharyngeal swallow study with no evidence of gross aspiration.
His HCP/guardian wanted to pursue further diagnostic work up of recurrent mass seen on ultrasound to help with prognosis and  planning of relocating the patient to be closer to the guardian in [**Name (NI) 108**] or sending the patient back to his home country of [**Country 7018**].
Repeat ultrasound during this admission notable for interval increase in a right posterior lobe mass likely representing HCC.
Hepatology was consulted and concluded that recent U/S and clinical evaluation were consistent with likley multifocal HCC.
Diagnostic testing to confirm this would not be helpful given this would not impact therapy and biopsy could precipitate fatal hemorrhage or rupture.
A diagnostic paracentesis was performed and ruled out SBP.
Fleet Enema 1 Enema PR DAILY:PRN constipation 8.
You third bedside swallow evaluation and video swallow study showed no evidence of gross aspiration.
You had a repeat ultrasound which shows likely recurrence of your liver cancer.
You had fluid removed from your abdomen ( paracentesis), and the fluid studies showed no evidence of infection.
