She was initially treated with fluid boluses (total 4L) to keep her SBP > 90, as well as diltiazem 10 mg IVP x2, diltiazem 30 mg and ceftriaxone.
Family noted that her heart rate was up again and she was audibly wheezing.
VNA assessment at 12:00 pm revealed 98.7F, BP 140/70, HR 132-152, SaO2 83%.
While in the ED, her initial vitals were 97.6F, HR 160, BP 94/61, RR 22, O2Sat 90% on 4L NC.
CXR showed bilateral lower lobe opacities R > L, mild interstital opacities and small bilateral effusion, ?atelectasis vs. PNA.
Her HR has been consistently in the 120s-130s with occasional rate up to the 150s.
Patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] on 50% venturi mask satting in the low 90%/95% on NRB, BP 93/64, HR 121, RR 24. .
Upon arriving the floor, vitals were BP 112/78, HR 130s-150s, RR 30s, 88% on 50% Venturi mask.
She was continued on her diltiazem drip, which was uptitrated to 15 mg/hr.

Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available on request.
Imaging: CXR [**2152-7-15**]: Mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
TTE [**2152-7-17**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-5-16**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly.
She was evaluated by the EP service, who felt that digoxin may actually worsen her cardiac output due to her underlying diastolic dysfunction seen on TTE.
Propranolol dose was gradually titrated up to 40mg q6hours, and she maintained sinus rhythm with HR in 70s.
She was started on coumadin, and INR on day of discharge was 2.3.
Could not obtain CT PE to confirm due to renal failure, so she was empirically started on IV heparin.
# Pneumonia: CXR on admission showed pulmonary edema with bilateral lower lobe opacities, and pneumonia could not be excluded.
Patient's white count trended down and was 12.2 on the day of discharge.
BP was well controlled.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
Start taking Propanolol to slow your heart rate and keep you in a regular rhythm.
