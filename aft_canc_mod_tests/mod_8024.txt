A stroke code was called and he was sent for CT imaging of the head.
His MRI returned with strokes on both sides of his brain (L MCA territory and small lesions in the R cerebellum and R parietal lobes) presumed to be from a cardioembolic source.
He was started on a heparin gtt at that time with goal PTT 50-70. .
During the admission, he has remained hemodynamically stable with SBP in the low 100's and HR in the 50-60's.
His neurological sx are slowly improving, and he now only has an exam sig.

TTE [**2164-10-1**]: Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT CHEST [**2164-10-1**]: IMPRESSION: Innumerable, randomly distributed small and medium-sized pulmonary nodulesm, necrotic mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, a more discrete left suprahilar lesion, likely part of left hilar lymphadenopathy or primary lung malignancy, smooth interlobular septal thickening and indeterminate heterogeneously hypodense liver lesion.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2164-10-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Micronodular pulmonary disease was characterized in prior CT of thorax the day prior to this exam and might represent granulomatous disease of infectious or idiopathic etiology, miliary metastatic disease or less likely lymphoma.
A dedicated MRI is recommended for further characterization.
Multiple splenic infarcts and a right kidney infarct are concerning for embolic process.
An echocardiogram is recommended for exclusion of endocarditis.
Cytology:  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,   consistent with adenocarcinoma  MICROBIOLOGY:  Urine Culture [**2164-9-30**]: No growth RPR [**2164-9-30**]: Negative HIV Ab [**2164-10-1**]: Negative MRSA screen [**2164-10-1**]: Negative AFB smear x 3 ([**Date range (3) 91276**]): No AFB's HAV Ab: Positive HBsAg: Negative HBsAb: Negative HBcAb: Negative HCV Ab: Negative    Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 91275**] is a 50 y/o R-handed man with PMHx of tuberculosis, diverticulitis, and 2 episodes of L facial numbness who presented with a L MCA stroke with some R-sided DWI abnormalities suggestive of a cardioembolic stroke source.
His exam was significant for mild R facial droop, mild aphasia (difficulty with production but not comprehension of speech) and mild RUE weakness.
His hospital course was complicated by a suspicion for reactivated TB given a CXR and CT chest that showed multiple fine nodules, as well as a an incidentally noted liver lesion of unclear [**Name2 (NI) 68402**], bilateral DVTs and splenic and kidney infarcts, with a final diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
When patient initially arrived, his SBP was in the mid-80's which improved with fluid boluses, albumin and keeping his HOB <30 degrees.
His exam improved when his SBP was over 100.
His MRI showed a smaller deficit than would have been expected based on his CT during the code stroke, which suggests he was already partially clearing one of his clots shortly after onset of symptoms.
Patient's bilateral strokes were felt to be likely cardioembolic so he was put on a heparin gtt at goal PTT of 50-70 for a 7-day course.
Notably, pt had diffuse hazy opacities in bilateral lung fields on CXR and CT chest.
# Liver mass: A liver lesion of unclear significance was found on CT scan.
Hepatitis serologies were negative.
AFP was 2.5.
# Possible PFO: A TTE showed possible PFO on this admission, which could be significant in the setting of stroke and renal and splenic infarctions.
Pt will need a TEE performed as an outpt  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: - Patient will need outpatient follow-up with neurology for stroke follow-up.
-Pt will follow up with oncology for further work-up of his adenocarcinoma  -Pt will need a TEE as an outpt to further work up his possible PFO  - Patient was full code on this admission.
Medications on Admission: - PRN albuterol - B12 supp   Discharge Medications: 1. enoxaparin 80 mg/0.8 mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Subcutaneous twice a day.
The neurologic symptoms that you presented with were because of blood clots that can occur because of cancer.
You will need to continue to take lovenox, which is a blood thinning medicine, to prevent the formation of further blood clots.
