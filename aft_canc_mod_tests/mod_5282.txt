Course at OSH: In brief, patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 18201**] on [**2157-9-12**], with productive cough, SOB, increased O2 requirement(2->4L) and treated for a COPD flare with levaquin, solumedrol IV, and advair.
His CXR was negative for new infiltrates and his Ucx was clear, but his blood grew MRSA and he was placed on IV vancomycin.
His respiratory status continued to worsen, but his VQ scan showed low probability for pulmonary embolism.
His Chest CT at the time demonstrated extensive LAD in his cervical and supraclavicular nodes bilaterally with extension down into the anterior mediastium and to the level of the AP window.
Previous CT on [**2157-6-27**], had in fact commented on chest mass/infiltrate.
Because of the rapid progression of the LAD, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further evaluation, tissue biopsy, and treatment.

The nontender superficial, LAD located in the cervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal areas is typical of Hodgkin's disease.
It is important to realize that renal involvement with lymphoma is seen in 2 to 14 percent of all patients, and an elevated serum creatinine is reported in 26 to 56 percent.
cor pulmonale/COPD: -supplemental oxygen -nebs -advair -spiriva -continue steroid taper .
Biopsy was performed in the OR after INR correction with FFP.
Preliminary pathology results showed poorly-differentiated large cell carcinoma with focal glandular and focal clear cell features.
