([**Telephone/Fax (1) 83256**])   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 30yoM with h/o HepB and metastatic HCC (Dx in [**5-/2125**], s/p 14cm mass resection in [**6-/2125**], with several different cycles of chemotherapy), several admissions recently, and per reports with significant increase in multiple pulmonary nodules who presented to ED with severe bilateral crampy leg pain and swelling that started acutely Friday am.
He had bilateral LENI's which did not show DVT.
He had RUQ u/s which was consistent with known hepatic disease and with apparently patent portal vein but with "low, to-and-fro flow" which was different from the previously hepatopetal flow.
Finally, had CT abd pelvis showing some possible disease progression, moderate ascites, areas of bowel wall thickening called as edema vs infection, and mass effect of enlarged liver compressing the IVC and ?
His labs in the ED were significant for [**3-17**] BCx's with GNR's, WBC count 3.0 with 12% bandemia, thrombocytopenia of 41 which is within baseline, newly elevated INR to 2.1 from 1.2, AG to 17, BUN/Cr 47/1.1, elevated LFT's which appears to have been uptrending, lactate 7.1.
Finally, pt had a Dx paracentesis which showed WBC's 27.6k (92% polys) and 22k RBC's, no organisms on GStain and culture pending.
In the ED he received: 2g IV Cefepime x2, 1g IV Vancomycin x2, 7L NS, 8mg IV Dilaudid, and 4mg IV Zofran.
Vitals before transfer: 116  96% on RA  92/60.
Currently ROS is only positive for BLE pain, and negative for all other systems.

[**11-30**] CT abd pelvis  FINDINGS: Within the lung bases, a 1.6 x 1.5 cm lesion at the left base (2:6) appears grossly similar to the prior MRI examination.
Direct comparison with MRI is limited, however, there may have been some progression.
Assessment of patency of the veins is not performed on this non-contrast examination.
Low, to-and-fro flow within the main/left portal vein, new from the prior examination when flow was hepatopetal.
Speciation was not complete by discharge, but sensitivities were done and bacteria was sensitive to Cipro.
Hepatitis B/HCC: Pt with end stage hepatocellular carcinoma s/p resection and numerous cycles of chemotherapy, most recently palliative Doxorubicin after having discussed with his Oncologist the risk for life threatening infection.
You were treated with antibiotics, medicine to maintain your blood pressure (from which you were weaned), and IV fluids.
