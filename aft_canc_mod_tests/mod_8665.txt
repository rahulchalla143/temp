Limited MRI study demonstrates T1 isointense lesion within the left parietal lobe which is compatible with hyperacute hematoma.
CT (head) Redemonstration of left intraparenchymal hemorrhage, minimally changed.
CT (chest/abdomen/pelvis) PRELIMINARY READ 1) No definite evidence of new metastatic disease.
We performed a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and final read was pending, w/ stable R adrenal adenoma.
Hypertension - patient initially required a nicardopine drip for systolic blood pressures ranging up to 220 systolic.
His BP was well-controlled for 2 days in the range of 140-170 systolic.
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage - the patient was found to have a left occipital subcortical hemorrhage on CT scan.
MRI w/ contrast could not be completed due to his inability to stay still in the MRI.
An outpatient MRI was scheduled for [**2124-2-26**].
Thus, since the MRI could not be performed, we were not able to rule out that the patient had an amyloid angiopathy as a possible explanation of the small posterior cingulate gyrus bleed.
On exam he was having some difficulty with word-finding, was unsteady when standing and was noted to be falling to the left.
Your CT showed evisence of a left subcortical occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
You had an MRI, but an MRI with contrast could not be done, as you were unable to stay still during the exam.
We decided that you should have an MRI within 2 months as an outpatient.
Your blood pressure was elevated during your stay and you required a nicardopine drip for 2 days.
The location of your stroke predisposes you to seizures and you were started on an antiepileptic (keppra), although your EEG showed no evidence of seizure activity.
You should have an MRI with contrast prior to this visit.
