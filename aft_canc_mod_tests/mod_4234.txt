EKG c/w SVT.
He underwent MRI of entire spine which has not yest been read.
Biopsy revealed diffuse large cell lymphoma.
LP at that time was negative for malignant cells but repeat LP on [**2168-2-17**] revealed malignant cells with MRI showing increased uptake in the sacral plexus.
Pertinent Results: B-glucan= >500  [**2168-7-16**] CXR: Comparison is made with prior examination performed one day ago.
[**2168-7-15**] MRI spine:  Compared to the previous study of [**2168-4-2**], there are now new focal signal abnormalities identified from L1 to L5 level.
[**2168-7-21**] MRI brachial plexus: Normal examination of the right and left brachial plexus, without abnormal enhancement.

MRI perforemd showed new focal signal abnormalities from L1-L5 and sacral bony involvement looks worse.
LUL infiltrate: Consolidation was visualized on CXR and CT chest.
A chest x-rday on [**7-23**] showed proessive left apical consolidation.
Eventually the patient underwent bronchoscopy which showed PCP.
Troponin up to 0.07 max in this setting.
Elevated troponin:  CK-MBI normal, troponin was elevated to max 0.08 likely in the setting of his SVT which is now resolved.
On [**2168-7-23**] methotrexate and leucovorin were started and methotrexate levels and labs were followed.
Patient was given decadron, and urine pH kept above 7 during treatment.
A repeat U/S has been ordered which showed improved clot burden since [**Month (only) **].
