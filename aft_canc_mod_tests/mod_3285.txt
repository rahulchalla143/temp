Admission Date:  [**2184-8-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-9-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-9-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: Lymphoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chemotherapy   History of Present Illness: HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 5395**] is a 55 y/o man with history of non-hodgkin's lymphoma with recently diagnosed recurrences who re-presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after being found with oxygen saturations of 88% on 6L NC.
The patient was discharged from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the BMT floor at approximately 5:00 pm; at that time, the patient's oxygen saturations were 95% on 2L NC.
His saturations improved to 90-91% on NRB.
EKG demonstrated NSR at 80, rSr', no significant ST/T wave changes from prior.
CXR at the time demonstrated increased bilateral opacities, worse since [**2184-8-15**].
After receiving lasix, the patient's saturations improved to 96% on NRB.
Bone marrow biopsy done on [**8-12**] demonstrated large B cell lymphoma; TTE was done on [**8-13**] in preparation for chemo, which was normal (no LVH, though E wave decel time upper limit of normal giving ?
A chest CT was done, which demonstrated multifocal bilateral upper lobe, RML, and superior segment LLL ground glass opacities with diffuse peribronchial thickening.
BP remained stable in 160s/100s.
At the time of transfer back to the flor, the patient was comfortable on 3 L NC with oxygen saturations in the mid 90s.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient states that his breathing is more comfortable than approximately 30 minutes prior.
FH: non-contributory  Physical Exam: PE: T 97.5 BP 175/88 HR 81 O2 96% on NRB, 88% on RA Gen: alert, middle-aged male, slightly cachectic, in slight respiratory distress with alopecia HEENT: [**Last Name (un) 2599**] dry, wearing NRB, PERRL, scattered petechiae on face Neck: JVP at 10 cm, no lymphadenopathy Chest: diffuse wheezing throughout, crackles at right base CV: RRR, no murmur appreciated though heart sounds difficult to hear due to wheezing Abd: normoactive bowel sounds, nontender to palpation throughout Ext: 1+ peripheral edema to the knees, warm & well perfused throughout Neuro: grossly intact, face symmetric, moving extremities without difficulty   Pertinent Results: Imaging:  [**8-12**] MRI HEAD HISTORY: 55-year-old man with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with tumor lysis syndrome, and now numbness of the right jaw concerning for cranial nerve involvement.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1; axial post-gadolinium T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, DTI of the head as well as axial 3-mm T1, post-gadolinium T1 with fat sat, T2; coronal T2 with fat-sat and post-gadolinium T1 with fat-sat images of the skull base were obtained.
FINDINGS: Correlation is made to MR of the cervical spine from an outside hospital dated [**2184-8-11**].
There are a few scattered T2 hyperintense foci of the subcortical and deep white matter, which may represent small vessel ischemic changes.
[**8-13**] CT chest w/o contrast: 1.
[**2184-8-30**] CT CHEST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with Large B-cell Lymphoma REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: re-eval s/p chemo r/o infection CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Had ARF  INDICATION: 55-year-old man with large B-cell lymphoma.
COMPARISON: CT chest without IV contrast dated [**2184-8-13**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT imaging of the chest was performed without intravenous contrast.
Images were obtained with 1.25 mm slice thickness and displayed in soft tissue and lung windows.
Coronal reformatted images were also obtained.
CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A right PIC catheter terminates within the right atrium, and repositioning is recommended.
Multifocal areas of ground-glass opacities seen on the prior CT have largely resolved.
Limited imaging of the upper abdomen is not sufficient for diagnosis.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-8-13**], the patient is no longer tachycardic.
Trace aortic regurgitation was present on the prior study (but not reported).
[**2184-9-4**]  CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST  IMPRESSION:  1.
He tolerated the chemo well, but required close monitoring of his volume status (diastolic HF) and his oxygenation, as well as tumor lysis status.
Upon return of his counts, patient's LDH also began to escalate, thought to be secondary to activity of his disease.
Pulmonary edema seemed most likely as oxygen saturation improved with lasix.
However, echo on [**8-13**] showed EF > 55%.
Patient had BAL positive for aspergillus, but was on voriconazole at the time of his hypoxia, and this would be unlikely to cause acute SOB.
CXR  showed bilateral infiltrates.
EKG showed no ischemic changes and enzymes were negative.
Creatinine improved on lanthanum and aluminum hydroxide with resolution of the syndrome and close monitoring of fluid balance.
Panculture was negative during time of stay.
UA was positive for 15 RBCs and 5 WBCs.
Would need further evaluation for hemorrhagic cystitis vs. BK virus vs nephrolithiasis.
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution Sig: One (1) ML Inhalation Q4 prn () as needed for SOB, wheezing.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-9**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day) as needed.
Sodium Chloride 1 gram Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
