CT Abdomen [**2149-9-26**]  1.
Pre-operatively the patient was found to have hematocrit of 37.1.
Post-operatively a complete blood count was sent and the hematocrit was 29.9.
On the morning of post-operative day one, the patient was found to have management reduced urine output of 10-12cc/hr and hypotension to 78/42.
The patient was triggered for hypotension, repeat laboratory values were sent and the patient's hematocrit was 25.9.
An EKG and showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 88 which was his baseline rhythm.
The patient received 2 unites of packed red blood cells and the hematocrit was Serial hematocrit levels were drawn and was 28.2.
Because of recent anticoagulation, the appearance of the patients tissue during the case, a moderate amount of ecchymosis around the port sites of the original laparoscopic procedure and persistent hypotension the patient was taken back to the operating room on [**2149-9-23**] for exploratory laparoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy to view the anastomosis and lumen of the colon.
During this case, little blood was visualized at the anastomosis however site, however a large amount of blood and clot was seen on flexible sigmoidoscopy which was washed out.
Serial hematocrits were drawn and remained stable with the goal to transfuse the patient if his hematocrit was below 25.
Throughout this time, the patient was not anticoagulated for his prosthetic heart valves.
The patient was kept in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring while initiating intravenous heparin at 500u/hr with a goal PTT 50-70 on [**2149-9-25**].
An abdominal CT scan was obtained [**2149-9-26**] which showed: Unremarkable-appearing ileocolonic anastomotic site with no peri-anastomotic fluid collection or significant inflammation, Small bowel ileus with no transition point to suggest obstruction, pockets of hematoma within the abdomen and lower pelvis as well as within the lower left rectus sheath likely at port site as delineated above, expected mild-to-moderate amount of residual postoperative pneumoperitoneum, with Mild amount of perihepatic ascites.
He remained on the intravenous heparin awaiting elevation of his INR to above 2.5 for Aortic/Mitral prosthetic valves.
