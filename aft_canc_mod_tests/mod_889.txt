URINE CULTURE [**2-8**] NEGATIVE BLOOD CX [**2-8**] NO GROWTH TO DATE ON [**2-13**]   Brief Hospital Course: CONFUSION: likely related to viral syndrome in addition to uremia, this may have been due in part to a few days of missed peritoneal dialysis due to weakness.
Patient's mental status cleared as he was treated for his infection, his electrolytes normalized and he was dialyzed (PD) for his uremia.
BACTERIAL PERITONITIS: initially started on antibiotics for bacterial peritonitis given initial WBC count of 300 on initial peritoneal fluid, however, this could have been due to no peritoneal dialysis for 2 days, 5 hours later her WBC count in his peritoneal fluid was in the 30s.
His antibiotics for SBP were discontinued.
Patient should have non-invasive vascular studies to evaluate arterial blood flow, this has been ordered for outpatient.
