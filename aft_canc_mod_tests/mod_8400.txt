Shortly after arrival she was taken to the operating room for repeat exploratory laparotomy.
Hemostasis was obtained from a bleeding vessel around the pancreas and the aortic repair appeared to be intact.
On the [**4-22**] she went back to the OR for a washout at which time the packing was removed, a liver biopsy was performed and the abdomen was again left open.
Her hospital course was characterized by a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course on multiple pressors, multiple abdominal washouts and takebacks for bleeding, placement of a vac and [**Location (un) **] patch to assist with abdominal closure, an NGT causing jejunal perforation requiring an omental patch, a J-tube, tracheostomy and eventual abdominal closure and weaning from the ventilator.
On [**2139-5-4**] she was noted to have a left lateral gaze deviation on exam; given her sedation it was difficult to evaluate for other signs of neuro deterioration and therefore she had a STAT Head CT; it was negative for a bleed and EEG monitoring was started shortly therafter and was negative for seizure activity.
She passed a speech & swallow eval for a PMV valve on [**2139-6-2**].
A bronchoscopy was largely unrevealing.
Although she had other reasons to be tachycardic (persistent ooze intraabdominal, sepsis), she was also very high risk for a pulmonary embolism and since this could not be ruled out a CTA of the Chest was performed on [**2139-5-9**] in coordination with a CT Abd/Pelvis to assess for intraabdominal collection/bleeding.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she was taken back to the OR for a repeat ex-lap and repair of pancreatic bleeding/packing, also as noted above.
She was taken back to the OR for a repeat washout on [**2139-5-14**] with an estimated 1 liter of clot/old blood removed, with the bleed/ooze originating from the liver bed which was treated with argon beam.
A CTA on [**2139-5-14**] did not show any active source of bleed but she continued to have a high pressor requirement and persistent need for transfusions.
She was taken to the OR on [**2139-5-18**] for abdominal closure which was achieved with the assistance of a porcine dermal strattice mesh closing the fascia.
On [**6-3**] patient was taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy , fractured Strattice mesh was found.
Regarding her liver function, while her transaminase returned to [**Location 213**] on [**2139-4-29**], her bilirubin continued to rise and peaked at 23.6 on [**2139-5-5**].
Urine output while she was on CVVH was, expectedly, zero but there were periods of time (brief) where the CVVH was halted temporarily and she made 5-15 cc/hr.
At the moment of discharge creatinine was 0.8 and she made 1220 cc for the last 24 hours before discharge with out diuretics.
She tested positive for clostridium difficile on [**5-2**] and [**5-9**]; A flex sig on [**5-3**] during a takeback to the OR did now show pseudomembranes and she did not show evidence of complications of cdiff colitis during her stay.
She also had Yeast infection with positive sputum, blood and peritoneal cultures, treated wiht fluconazole, patient was discharge with 7 more days of fluconazole.
