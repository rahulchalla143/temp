He began the protocol on Monday and had been tollerating the TID IL-2 infusions, but had a decline in his plts from 200 to 56 as well as a 11# weight gain attributed to capillary leak.
Recent PET/CT done revealed a left axillary lymphadenopathy as well as 2 liver lesions.
Reports recent normal EGD and colonoscopy   Social History: Married, 4 kids, quit smoking 35 years ago (prior 7pk yr hx), rare EtOH use, retired engineer .

[**2170-3-31**] CXR PORTABLE IMPRESSION: New diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities compatible with pulmonary edema.
[**2170-3-31**] CHEST XR: A single AP supine view is compared to previous examination earlier from the same day.
[**2170-4-2**] BILATERAL LE DOPPLER IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
ECHO [**2170-4-2**]: EF>60% Conclusions: 1.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
[**2170-4-9**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-2**] and 24: Left lower lobe consolidation is clearing, probably resolving atelectasis.
*** CULTURE DATA *** [**4-11**] urine cx neg [**4-10**] blood cx X 6 pending [**4-10**] sputum cx: 2+ GPC in pairs, sparse growth oropharyngeal flora [**4-10**] stool: O&P pending [**4-7**] blood cultures neg [**4-7**] worm macroscopic pending [**4-6**] CMV VL not detected [**4-6**] Crytococcus negative [**4-5**] Rapid resp viral negative [**4-5**] BAL: oropharyngeal flora, no PMN, no microorg, neg fungal, AFB   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, [**2170-3-29**], patient had some mild epigastric discomfort and complained to his daughter of heartburn.
His Hct was noted to be stable, with stable VS, and no episodes of melena.
Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl (stopped [**4-8**]), RUQ US to r/o cholangitis (b/c pt had elev LFTs), and stated would not give steroids, and would do bronchoscopy/BAL for most likely pulm source.
Chest CT demonstrated b/l lower lobe infiltrates c/w pulm edema vs. PNA.
Pt underwent Bronch [**4-5**], showing limited eval of right sided airways, lavage with RLL post segment, result: no PMN, no microorg, grew OP flora, PCP negative, AFB negative.
line infection, and b/c the pt had difficult access, his line was continued for 19 days.
His creatinine continued to rise to 2.6 (baseline 0.9).
They felt he had a number of reasons to have ARF, including: capillary leak syndrome, NSAIDs, infection, contrast on [**4-2**], and drug reaction though no eos or WBC in urine.
The pt's creatinine demonstrated slow improvement, was 1.4 [**4-7**], and on transfer from ICU, his Cr was 0.9 (baseline).
Chest CT showed lower lobe infiltrates c/w pulm edema vs PNA.
The pt was then taken off all abx on [**4-11**] because all cx data was negative and fevers seemed likely due to acute interstitial nephritis given eosinophilia, ARF, rash versus due to his melanoma and IL'2 treatment.
Bronchoscopy from [**4-5**] was negative.
However, eos negative in urine.
His creatinine continued to be at his baseline.
Free water boluses and D5w was given with normalization of sodium.
?Line infection:  Pt was continuing to spike fevers in the ICU with a negative panculture workup and no infiltrate.
His blood cx are negative to date.
His restaging lung CT, head CT showed only mediastinal nodes largest 1.7 cm, could not assess for pulm nodules given pulm edema.
His Hct has remained stable, as well as his vital signs.
We held his IL-2, and trended his LFTs, which improved over time.
His haldol was not given while he was on the medical floor.
Nutrition: The pt initially failed his speech and swallow study, however the study was done a few hours post extubation, when the pt still had copious secretions.
