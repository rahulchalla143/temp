She maintained a baseline Creatinine baseline in the range of 0.7-1.1 until very recently.
Her postoperative Creatinine was noted to be increased to 2.2 and peaked at 3.5 on [**5-2**].
Her potassium levels have also intermittently increased to 6.0, but are currently down after Kayexalate.
She remained hemodynamically stable and other than a single blood pressure drop to 70's systolic and few readings in the 90's systolic, there were no major hypotensive events.
On [**5-2**], UOP was 20-45 cc/hr, on 1-2L oxygen, BPs 90-106/60-76.
Splenectomy [**9-/2198**] for ITP 3.

Imaging: CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2205-5-13**] 8:42 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-4**], the monitoring and support devices have been removed.
MRI of head limited study -52 REDUCED SERVICES Study Date of [**2205-5-11**] 5:51 PM FINDINGS: This is a non-diagnostic and incomplete examination, the axial images demonstrate significant motion, however high-signal intensity is visualized in both basal ganglia, suggesting changes due to hepatic encephalopathy.
A trace of high signal intensity is demonstrated on FLAIR on the right insular region (image 12, 13, 14, series #7), suggesting possible proteinaceous material versus subarachnoid hemorrhage, please consider repeat examination under conscious sedation.
IMPRESSION: Non-diagnostic examination due to patient motion.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2205-5-10**] 5:30 PM There is no intracranial hemorrhage, and no parenchymal edema or mass effect.
CXR [**5-3**] FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-15**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
At the time of the study paracentesis is scheduled.

CVVH was initiated in the MICU, and patient was temporarily on pressors to maintain blood pressures with renal replacement therapy.
She was transitioned to midodrine to maintain blood pressures.
# Pseudomonas Bacteremia: Blood cultures from [**5-4**] grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
Head CT showed no acute process.
Infectious work-up was unrevealing.
Etiology of acute decompensation is still unclear but may have been multifactorial.
