His oxygen saturation decreased and he had a VQ scan to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was indeterminate.
On [**2-13**], the patient had stable blood pressures to the 120s and was transferred to the Floor.
On [**2-16**], he was noted to be increasingly somnolent and tachypneic, with gross hematuria, decreased urine output and an increased creatinine from 1.4 to 2.4.
His oxygen saturation was 84% on room air and his systolic blood pressure dropped to the 50s.
Serial arterial blood gases revealed a pCO2 from 53 to 72 and a pH of 7.3 to 7.21, to 7.17.
The patient subsequently had one out of four blood cultures positive for Gram negative rods as well as E. coli in his urine.
His blood pressure subsequently improved, and his Dopamine drip was discontinued on [**2-18**].
A chest x-ray on [**2-18**], revealed left lower lobe consolidation and collapse and his sputum revealed a three plus Gram negative rods.
He was noted to have a CT scan with contrast on [**2-15**], and his acute renal failure was attributed both to hypotension as well as to contrast ATN.
On [**2-19**], he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 25.4, was extubated successfully and was transferred to the Floor on [**2-20**].
He then complained of increasing groin pain, and his hematocrit was noted to have dropped six points.
A CT scan of his leg revealed a collection medial to the right femoral vein tracking down along the femur.
The patient has an ejection fraction of 44%.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was negative.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.4 to 1.5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a blood pressure of 178/74; heart rate of 103; saturation of 96% on two liters of oxygen; respiratory rate of 23; he was afebrile.
His distal pulses were Doppler-able bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  His laboratory data on [**2-21**], the patient had a white blood cell count of 11.7, hematocrit of 29.9, platelet count of 184.
He had an INR of 1.0, PTT of 35.6, a sodium of 1.4, potassium of 3.9, chloride 108, CO2 of 22, BUN of 59, creatinine of 1.2, glucose of 207 and albumin of 2.3, calcium of 8.2, phosphate of 3.4 and a magnesium of 1.9.
He had an EKG which revealed normal sinus rhythm with supraventricular extra systoles.
He has a right bundle branch morphology with a rate of 77.
On [**2-20**], he had a CT scan of the abdomen which revealed a heterogeneous mass extending from the level of the pubic symphysis to the proximal femur posteriorly consistent with hematoma.
On [**2-18**], he had a transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 45%, mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with basal infero-septal and inferior and apical hypokinesis.
On [**2-20**], he had a chest x-ray which revealed consolidation/collapse of the left lower lobe.
On Microbiologic data on [**2-18**], the patient had endotracheal sputum which revealed greater than 25 leukocytes and less than 10 epithelial cells.
A sputum culture revealed moderate growth of beta Strep.
He had a urine culture which revealed greater than 100,000 E. coli.
Blood cultures from [**2-16**], revealed one out four Gram negative rods.
Hematology:  The patient was admitted to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and follow-up by the Vascular Service.
His hematocrit was checked every four hours with a goal level of greater than 27.
On the evening of [**2-22**], the patient's hematocrit decreased to 26.6 after two units of packed red blood cells.
His hematocrit subsequently remained stable at approximately 30.
We subsequently checked his hematocrits every 12 hours and they remained stable throughout his hospital stay.
Once his hematocrit was stable for 24 hours, he was restarted on his Lovenox.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had a history of a lower GI bleed with a recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, which were negative.
The Endocrine Service recommended adding AndroGel to the patient's regimen once a baseline PSA and prostate examination were obtained.
His white blood cell count was elevated, but we attribute this to the steroids.
Ultram 50 to 100 mg p.o.
