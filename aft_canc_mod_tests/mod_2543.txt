EMS was called; initially patient with SBP 50 and HR 130s.
CT showed pancreatic edema and ascites on imaging; no gallstones seen.
Labs at OSH: WBC 16.4, Na 135, K 3.5, Ca 8.2, Cr 2.67, Amylase 1661, Lipase 758.
Physical Exam: Admission Exam to ICU: Vitals: 98.7 126 156/58 19 97 RA General: Alert, oriented, appears uncomfortable but NAD HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: mild rales at bases B/L, nonlabored breathing CV: regular rhythm, tachy, no M/R/G Abdomen: soft, no shake tenderness, mild guarding, diffuse tenderness to moderate palpation, no rebound tenderness, GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: CT report from OSH (oral contrast, no IV): no gallstones seen, but GB distended and likely "sludge" no ductal dilitation, "severe" pancreatitis, w/ extensive extrahepatic inflammation in abdominal pelvic mesentary, moderate pancreatic ascites, thickening of wall of descending colon.
RUQ US [**9-24**] 1.
CXR [**9-27**] FINDINGS: There is improved aeration in the region of the right mid/upper lung described previously.
An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded at the bases.
CT abdomen [**9-30**]-IMPRESSION: 1.
[**9-30**] MRI abdomen- IMPRESSION: 1.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT abdomen [**10-8**]-IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT [**10-1**]-IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Abd CT [**10-15**] INDICATION: Severe pancreatitis, now with fevers and bacteremia.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pelvic outlet without intravenous contrast.
COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2104-10-13**] and [**10-7**], [**2104**].
FINDINGS: CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted and appear enlarged from prior examination, particularly on the right side.
The gallbladder is again noted to be edematous similar to a prior study on [**2104-10-13**].
On this non-contrast CT the pancreas is not high density and not suggestive of hemorrhage in the pancreatic parenchyma.
However an anterior pancreatic pseudocyst that measured 5.8 cm on prior examination appears smaller on today's examination, measuring approximately 4.9 cm (2:43).
There is more ascites than on prior study tracking perihepatically and into the left paracolic gutter.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The distal transverse, descending and sigmoid colon and rectum are all collapsed, unchanged.
KUB [**10-28**]: Final Report INDICATION: C-diff colitis, complaining of worsening abdominal pain and discomfort, evaluate for megacolon.

Initially presented with leukocytosis with bandemia, severe pain, and positive blood culture for gram negative rods, on IV zosyn and aggressively hydrated.
OSH CT scan showing distended GB and RUQ showed mild CBD dilatation at 8mm but no stone/sludge.
MRCP showed extensive pancreatitis, ascites, and fluid around the liver but no biliary dilitation.
Autoimmune serologies were sent and unremarkable.
Switched to cefipime and covered empirically for C. Diff for a few days on Po Vanc and IV Flagyl which were later discontinued after C. Diff PCR returned negative.
Repeat CT Abdomen showed mild area of necrosis.
Due to continued abdominal pain, distented abdomen, and woresening anemia, pt underwent a repeat CT scan on [**10-7**] that showed evolving pancreatic pseudocyst, new SMV thrombosis with edema of the ascending colon, no evidence of hemorrhagic pancreatitis or necrosis.
On [**10-14**] her Hct dropped to 20 and she received 2 units of PRBCs.
Her CT was repeated and showed no change in the pancreas, but increse in pleural effusion on the right side.
Her NGT was removed, and PO diet was slowly reintroduced.
They recommended advancing diet as tolerated (avoiding high-fat foods), and follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 908**] of Gastroenterology in his clinic within the next 2 weeks (they are working on an appointment - the phone number for the GI division is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 463**]).
Pt initially on zosyn and later transitioned to cefepime (when WBC increased to 28K, later attributed to pancreatitis and not bactermia).
Potential sources were transient cholangitis from blocked CBD stone, or translocation from a thickened descending colon found on abdominal CT scan.
Blood cultures from [**10-12**] grew E. coli as well and at this time pt.
After transfer back to the floor, the pt was placed on Tigecycline for better coverage of her C. diff in the setting of a rising WBC (up to 35K) despite PO/PR Vanco and IV Flagyl.
Multiple sets of blood cultures since [**10-12**] have been negative.
# Acute Kidney injury: Creatinine was 1.8 at the time of admission.
She responded well to fluid resuscitation and her creatinine rapidly corrected.
Cr 0.4 on the day of discharge .
TTE showed low normal LVEF, 1+ MR, borderline elevated PASP.
She was transitioned back to Metoprolol PO on [**2104-10-24**] (no diltiazem), with doses titrated based on BP and HR.
This was stopped on the day of the transfer back to the ICU, as repeat abdominal imaging was obtained, and upon further review by Radiology and GI, it was determined that the patient most likely did NOT have an SMV thrombosis, and that the occlusion in the SMV was due to extrinsic compression, most likely due to significant underlying inflammation and edema from her pancreatitis.
In the hospital she received: - Ipratropium Bromide Neb 1 NEB IH Q6H:PRN shortness of breath - Albuterol 0.083% Neb Soln 1 NEB IH Q6H:PRN shortness of breath  - Fluticasone Propionate 110mcg 2 PUFF IH [**Hospital1 **] .
AlkPhos 142 on [**10-28**].
Na 131 on the day of discharge.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis - Acute pancreatitis - Ecoli bacteremia - Hypertension - Severe C. diff infection Minor spinal stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Multiple images here revealed that the pancreas was significantly inflamed.
