Infectious work-up was unremarkable and his fevers were atrributed to a reaction to platelet transfusion.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.3, BP 122/83, HR 100, RR 12, 100% on 4L.
Pt was intubated for CT head and abdomen.
LP was deferred given platelet count of 14.
CT head was negative and CT abdomen was notable for slightly worsened ascites, new bibasilar opacities.
A CT scan demonstrated multiple enlarged portahepatis lymph nodes (largest 1.5 x 2.7 cm)and portacaval lymph nodes (largest 1.9 cm x 3.4 ) as well as multiple mildly enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.2 x 1.9cm.
On [**2116-1-6**], he underwent a CT-guided fine-needle aspiration of a portahepatis lymph node which was nondiagnostic.
A bone marrow biopsy was obtained on [**2116-2-26**], demonstrating involvement by high-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Tumor cells were diffusely positive for pan B cell markers CD20 and PAX-5, with co-expression of CD10 and bcl-2.
It was noted that a definitive diagnosis would require flow cytometry and molecular studies, which could not be performed because there were no blasts in the peripheral blood and a marrow aspirate could not be obtained (dry tap).
However, the peripheral blood sample was sent for immunophenotyping, which demonstrated a new population of CD34 positive cells and a small population of CD19 positive cells in the "blast" gait, without expression of TdT.
Course B was not given due to his history of hepatic cirrhosis.
A liver biopsy on [**5-8**] and repeat bone marrow biopsies on [**6-12**] and [**7-19**] have shown no evidence of recurrent lymphoma.
A CBC showed a WBC of 7.2 with 14% blasts.
A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated marked fibrosis and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.
In addition, he was treated with rituximab 375mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2, doxorubicin 20mg/m2, and dexamethasone 20mg from [**10-19**]- [**10-21**].
The patient was noted to have recurrence of peripheral blasts on [**2116-11-9**], with a bone marrow biopsy on [**2116-11-11**] showing residual leukemia in the marrow.

CT abd/pelvis: Slightly worsened ascites.
CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
CXR PA and lat: Interpretation is limited by patient rotation and kyphotic angulation.
Wedge compression deformities of two low thoracic vertebral bodies are unchanged.
