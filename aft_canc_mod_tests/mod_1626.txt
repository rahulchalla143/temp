In the ED, her vital signs were: Temp 97.5, HR 102, BP 151/63, RR 20, Sat 94% on RA.
A CTA was performed which showed bilateral pulmonary embolism.
However, given that she has bilateral PE and EKG shows right heart strain, she was admitted to the MICU for observation.
Recurrent metastatic uterine cancer - 6 cycles carboplatin chemo, CT scan [**2136-10-11**] with mets to liver, spleen, retrocaval nodes, and distal ileum serosal soft tissue.

[**2136-11-10**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no significant axillary lymphadenopathy.
There are two lymph nodes visualized in the AP window which appear more prominent than previously seen.
The lung window images reveal no areas of consolidation or lung nodules.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiple reconstructions confirm the above findings.
[**2136-11-10**] CT of head: FINDINGS: There is no intracranial mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures or major vascular territorial infarction.
MRI with and without gadolinium is more sensitive for picking up of brain metastases.
EKG [**2136-11-10**]: Sinus tachycardia at rate 101.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2135-7-7**] atrial tachycardia and T wave changes are new.
EKG [**2136-11-11**]: Sinus tachycardia at rate 106.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-11-10**] the T waves are now upright in leads V2-V3.
EKG [**2136-11-12**]: Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-11-11**] no significant change.

Given that she has bilateral PE and EKG shows right heart strain, she was admitted to the MICU for observation.
The patient's O2 saturation improved with anticoagulant treatment; at the time of discharge, the patient was saturating in the 95-96% range at rest, and 92% during ambulation on room air.
The patient has known mets to the liver and her elevated enzymes were thought to be secondary to the liver mets.
