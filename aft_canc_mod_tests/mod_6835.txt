#RADIOLOGY/STUDIES: [][**6-7**] LENIs - no evidence DVT  [][**6-7**] CT chest/abdomen 1.
Numerous bilateral bronchovascular ground-glass opacities, right greater than left, similar to or minimally increased from [**2100-5-27**].
[]ISSUES: # Hypotension: Pt presented to the ED with lightheadedness and was found to have systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
Blood cultures from [**6-3**] at [**Location (un) **] were NGTD.
CT chest unchanged from baseline.
Pt was at baseline blood pressure after fluids in ED.
Hypovolemic shock not likely as good urine output with IVF.
Urine culture showed no growth.
The patient was also on gemcitabine which suppresses the bone marrow which is consistent with his low retic count of 0.2.
Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic inflammation (normocytic, high ferritin, low TIBC and low transferrin).
HCT remained stable since transfer from ICU to floor (24 --> 23.9).
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
