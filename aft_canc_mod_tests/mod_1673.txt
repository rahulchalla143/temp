Recommend correlation with followup study when the acute blood products resolve.
CT Head [**4-10**]: FINDINGS: Patient is status post left craniotomy and resection of large left temporal mass.
MRI Head [**4-9**]: FINDINGS: In the region of the left temporal lobe including the hippocampus, there are two heterogeneously enhancing lesions with thick rind of enhancing tissue surroudning necrotic areas in the center corresponding to those described on the CT scan done on the same day.
Diagnostic considerations include primary CNS infiltrative malignancy such as glioblastoma multiforme or less likely a lymphoma, though metastatic disease is also in the differential diagnosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1313**] was admitted after CT revealed a new large left temporal brain mass.
He was extubated the following day and his neuro exam improved.
His motor neurologic examination was non-focal.
