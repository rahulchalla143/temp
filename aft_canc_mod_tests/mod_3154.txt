She recently developed vaginal bleeding which led to a CT scan and MRI which showed a large parasacral mass She underwent resection of the large parasacral mass along with reconstruction of the left uretero-ureteral anastomosis.
Approximately one week later, she had a CT scan which showed a large pelvic fluid collection with delayed contrast.
A drain was placed, and subsequent cystogram demonstrated a vesicovaginal fistula.
Cystoscopy with left retrograde pyelography demonstrated that the left ureter was intact without evidence of fistula at the site of previous repair.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination reveals a pleasant 67-year-old white female comfortable in no apparent distress.
Vital signs:  Temperature 98.7, blood pressure 116/78, pulse 60, respiratory rate 18.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORIES PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 7.7, hematocrit of 32.3%.
Her BUN was 10.0, creatinine was 0.9, potassium 4.2.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Her preoperative electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2121-6-13**] at which time she underwent an exploratory laparotomy with extensive lysis of adhesions.
That evening she was noted to have a low blood pressure with low urine output and a low CVP and received multiple boluses of IV fluids and 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
Her blood pressure and heart rate remained well controlled with IV metoprolol and her pain was controlled with the epidural until approximately postoperative day five.
Her Telemetry monitor revealed about 10-15 beats at 155 beats per minute with spontaneous return to 95 beats per minute.
An electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.
Her electrolytes were within normal limits.
The blood pressure was 101/60.
The heart rate was elevated to the 140's.
An electrocardiogram obtained at that time revealed atrial fibrillation, which was rate controlled and converted to sinus rhythm with 5 mg of IV diltiazem.
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, and the Cardiology service was notified.
Per their recommendations, her metoprolol dose was increased, she was started on a baby aspirin, and an echocardiogram was performed.
Both of her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were removed, although the ureteral stents were left in place.
Her echocardiogram performed hospitalization revealed an ejection fraction of 25% with severe global left ventricular hypokinesia.
