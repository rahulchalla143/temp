EKG shows sinus tachycardia, rate 130, normal axis, normal intervals for rate, no ST-T wave changes, Q in lead 3 which is old compared to [**9-/2157**].
Chest x-ray shows a small left pleural effusion with clips in the left chest, cardiomegaly, no infiltrate, no free air.
The gastrointestinal service was consulted and they performed an EGD which showed a hiatal hernia, esophageal candidiasis, grade 3 esophagitis in the whole esophagus, a likely [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear, severe duodenitis and concluded that the source of his GI bleed was the erosive esophagitis and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tears.
His blood sugar was increased presumably as a result of the Octreotide treatment so he receives insulin on a sliding scale.
On the final day of his admission he developed a low grade fever to 100.4 which then went down to 99.0 but to rule out infection we checked the urinalysis which was normal and chest x-ray which showed an infiltrate in the left posterior lobe of the lung which may have represented pneumonia so we treated with Levofloxacin 500 mg po q d for a 7 day course.
