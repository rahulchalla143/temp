Discharge Labs: 146 110  35 ------------< 107 3.4  27  1.8 .
INR 1.2 .
Studies: CXR [**2153-5-8**]: The tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 6.6 cm above the level of the carina.
CT TORSO, NONCONTRAST [**2153-5-8**]: 1.
Numerous regional lymph nodes, none of which necessarily meet CT criteria for enlargement, but the number of these nodes is concerning for local metastatic disease.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2153-5-9**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
EGD [**2153-5-8**]: Contents: Coffee ground heme was seen in the fundus and stomach body.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the pyloric mass.
Suggest CT scan and surgical consult.
PYLORIC MASS BIOPSY [**2153-5-8**]: Adenocarcinoma, at least intramucosal, arising in a background of low and high grade dysplasia.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6311**] stain is negative for H. pylori.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # UPPER GI BLEED/PYLORIC ADENOCARCINOMA:  He initially presented to OSH with weakness and fatigue and was found to have a hematocrit of 15.5.
His admission hematocrit was 20.1.
GI team performed upper endoscopy which revealed a large fungating pyloric mass with stigmata of recent bleeding, and retained food products in the stomach suggesting possible gastric outlet obstruction.
CT torso without contrast showed this pyloric mass with possibly enlarged lymph nodes nearby, but no widespread metastatic disease.
As his hematocrit remained stable, no emergent surgery was performed overnight on HD1.
His hematocrit was stable for the duration of his hospitalization.
Upper extremity ultrasound revealed a non-occlusive thrombus in the right cephalic vein which did not extend to the axillary vein and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
INACTIVE ISSUES # DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE:  Outpatient cardiologist echo showing EF=50% with evidecne of diastolic dysfunction.
# HYPERTENSION:  Developed BP to 160s-180s on HD3, felt to be related to fluid overload.
An upper endoscopy demonstrated a large mass in your stomach.
Biopsy revealed a gastric cancer.
Your blood pressure was noted to be low, and your heart rate was higher than normal, therefore multiple changes were made to your medication list.
