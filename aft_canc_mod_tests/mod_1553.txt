Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
TTE [**1-11**] The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-1-5**], the heart rate is faster.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-1-2**], regional LV systolic dysfunction is new.
- CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2103-12-30**] 5:39 PM CHEST: Scattered calcifications are seen along the thoracic aorta with areas of mural thrombus seen in the descending aorta.
Further evaluation with echocardiogram is recommended.
Recommend liver MRI for further evaluation of the liver abnormalities as clinically indicated.
Dense oral contrast from a prior CT is seen to the level of the rectum.
There are calcifications of the aorta and bilateral iliac arteries.
Recommend echocardiogram for better evaluation of the heart.
This can be further evaluated on pelvic ultrasound or MRI as clinically warranted.
Bilateral breast calcification; suggest correlation with mammography.

sensitivity testing performed by Microscan.
She was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where a bedside ECHO revealed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild global right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and a decreased EF of 30% most consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
She had a TnT leak with a peak level of 0.08.
A TTE revealed improved systolic dysfunction with an EF 50-55%.
Changed from heparin gtt to lovenox once cardiology decided that patient would not need another catheterization as an inpatient.
Of note, right IJ placed [**1-10**] so that was d/c'd on [**1-18**] per ID after new PICC was placed due to access difficulties.
Patient had a CT head without contrast without evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift.
She was treated with Flagyl X2 days per ID but as diarrhea resolved and cdiff was negative twice again, was discontinued.
Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day: Hold for HR <65 or SBP <110.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - ovarian cancer  Secondary - sepsis, UTI - mucositis - partial SBO   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of abdominal pain and vomiting and with a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
