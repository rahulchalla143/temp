She went to an OSH where she was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis based upon lab data (amylase 8289, lipase 36,687) and imaging studies (abdominal CT scan done [**3-9**] showed extensive pancreatitis with a large amount of ascites and poor enhancement in the body and tail raising a question of necrosis).
The etiology was presumed to be due to gallstones; her initial CT scan reportedly showed 7 cm CBD dilatation without evidence of cholelithiasis.
A repeat CT scan reportedly showed progression of pancreatitis with increasing ascites.
On [**3-15**] her leukocytosis rose to 29,000 and she was therefore transferred here for further management and possible surgical debridement.

Pancreatitis: Appears most likely to be due to gallstones or biliary sludge despite lack of evidence of cholelithiasis on OSH CT scans.
Absent evidence of pancreatic necrosis on CT scanning, there is no apparent indication for empiric antibiotics.
- D/C imipenem   - CXR now to evaluate pleural effusions, r/o infiltrate   - Abd U/S now to evaluate extent of ascites   - Consider thoracentesis vs. paracentesis to r/o secondary infection   - Blood cultures x2 now   - U/A and urine culture now   - Stool for C. diff (patient developed diarrhea at OSH); consider metronidazole   - Low threshold to repeat CT scan to r/o necrosis or abscess  3.
The primary process is respiratory; her serum bicarb is 25.
- CXR now as above   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis, although fluid will likely reaccumulate   - Supplemental oxygen   - [**Month (only) 116**] require intubation for adequate oxygenation   - Consider arterial line  4.
There is concern for hemorrhagic pancreatitis given the severity of her inflammation, but there is no physical exam evidence of this.
- Send iron studies, folate, B12, retic count   - TFTs likely to be unhelpful in acute setting   - Send type and screen   - Transfuse for Hct less than 21  5.
Continued to monitor her LFTs which stayed stable.
