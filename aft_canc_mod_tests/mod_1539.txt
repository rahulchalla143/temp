Admission Date:  [**2169-5-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-6-2**]   Service:  Neurosurgery/cardiac medicine HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 30097**] is a 79 year-old Russian male with history of renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**2166**], status post left nephrectomy in 2,000, status post IL2 therapy, with lung metastasis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes who presented one year ago with an metastatic renal cell carcinoma in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year.
An MRI on [**2169-5-1**] showed a dural based mass involving the calvarium and superior sagittal sinus.
On the evening of [**5-24**], however, the patient developed right arm Enzymes were cycled at that time and the patient ruled in for non-Q wave myocardial infarction with troponin peaking at greater than 50 and CK of 1,014 with an MB of 82.
Electrocardiogram showed a new left bundle branch with ST elevation and T wave inversions in V3 and V4.
The patient was then taken for cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel disease with left main disease and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed prophylactically.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer temperature of 99, blood pressure of 150/90, pulse was 75, O2 saturation was 95% on three liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination revealed a bandaged scalp with an incision that went across the top of his head.
Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.
On brief neurologic testing the patient showed no focal signs.
LABORATORY STUDIES:  White count was 8.2 with hematocrit of 28 and platelets of 194.
Chem-7 was remarkable only for BUN of 36, creatinine of 1.7 which was the patient's baseline.
Serum glucose was 285.
CKs peaked at 1,014 with an MB of 82 and MB index of 8.
Troponin was greater than 50.
Chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure and no focal infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram on [**5-17**] showed sinus bradycardia with left ventricular hypertrophy and left axis deviation.
Electrocardiogram on [**5-24**] showed bigeminy with flattened T waves anteriorly and later in the evening with development of chest pain and new left bundle branch block.
Electrocardiogram on [**5-25**] elevations in V3 and V4 with T wave inversion.
Echocardiogram from [**2168-4-11**] showed left atrial enlargement with slight left ventricular hypertrophy.
Ejection fraction was measured at 45 percent.
Echocardiogram postoperatively on this admission showed left atrial enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement.
Ejection fraction was estimated at 20 to 25 percent.
Cardiac catheterization on [**5-25**] showed left main disease with an ostial 38 or 40 percent, distal 90 percent, mid LAD lesion of 80 percent, diagonal of 100 percent, mid left circumflex of 90 percent with right to left collateral flow distally, RCA with 90 percent involving the PDA.
Given the patient's three vessel with left main disease the patient was evaluated by CT surgery.
Given the patient's elevated left ventricular and diastolic pressure of 26 the patient was diuresed and later started on a daily dose of Lasix orally.
The patient's hematocrit stayed persistently between 28 and 30 while the intra-aortic balloon pump was in.
Hemolysis laboratories were sent ruling this out as the etiology.
Patient was transfused several units of blood with inappropriate bumps after intra-aortic balloon pump was removed hematocrit climbed to the 33 and was stable for several days.
Platelet count began to rise after the balloon pump was removed.
A head CT obtained showed postoperative changes with edema and effacement of the sulci over the left parietal region.
MRI obtained showed mild compression of the lateral [**Doctor Last Name 534**] on the left .
On the date of discharge right and left biceps were noted to 4+/5, triceps were 5-/5, right iliopsoas was -[**4-15**], quads and hamstrings were [**4-15**], tibialis anterior was [**4-15**] and plantar flexors were [**4-15**].
The remainder of the neurologic examination was unremarkable.
Patient' creatinine stayed stable at 1.7 to 1.9 with adequate urine output.
The patient was eventually started on ciprofloxacin renally dosed for his creatinine clearance of a sterile pyuria.
12) regular insulin sliding scale 0 to 70 give D50 or juice, 71 to 160 give nothing, 161 to 200 give 2 units, 201 to 250 give 4 units, 251 to 300 give 6 units, 301 to 350 give 8 units, 351 to 400 give 10 units, greater than 401 give 12 units.
Hematocrit was found to be within normal limits.
TSH was still pending at the time of discharge.
