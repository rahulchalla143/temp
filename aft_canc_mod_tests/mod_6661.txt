However on the day of admission he became tachypneic into the 140s and underwent a CT-A of his chest to rule out PE which showed a large pericardial effusion.
His systolic BP was stable between 110- 115.
He had a pulsus paradoxus of 30 to 40 mmHg.
He was transfered here and underwent emergent ECHO which showed large pericardial effusion and hypercontractile ventricle.
On arrival, his vitals were Afebrile, 107, 114/70, 22, 94% 2L  Past Medical History: 1.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  On discharge: alert, walking around halls without difficulty.

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
Imaging:  ECHO [**3-17**] The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
ECHO [**3-18**] Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-3-17**] the pericardial effusion is mostly gone.
ECHO [**3-20**] The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-3-19**], the pericardail effusion now appears slightly larger.
CXR [**3-18**] Comparison is made to prior study from the day before.
Percardiocentesis was done and the >500cc was drained.
Pericardial fluid studies were unrevealing.
He continued to spike fevers and infectious work-up did not reveal any additional causes.
Repeat TTEs were done s/p drainage and when the drain was pulled, showing resolution of the effusion.
An echocardiogram will be repeated as an outpatient.
# RHYTHM:  Pt presented with rapid A-Fib, which appeared to be new and coincided with his effusion.
In this setting his BP transiently decreased to SBP 70s but quickly increased to 100s.
He had no further episodes and his EKGs were stable upon discharge, in NSR.
Urine studies and very small response to fluid boluses made this clinical picture more consistent with SIADH.
The sodium improved to 128, but he will be receiving outpatient lab work to monitor his sodium.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Creatinine peaked at 1.3, initially thought to be secondary to hypovolemia.
Renal function should be followed up as an outpatient.
Your pain and breathing improved after removal of the fluid and 2 subsequent echocardiograms did not show that the fluid was coming back.
Another echocardiogram will be done in about a 1-2 weeks.
