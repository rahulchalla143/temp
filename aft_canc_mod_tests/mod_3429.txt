He did well until he developed hemoptysis in [**2151-7-23**] with CT scan showing a 3-cm right mediastinal mass and 2-cm right upper lobe nodule.
Bronchoscopy showed a fungating right upper lobe tumor with biopsy consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
He is being admitted today on [**2152-5-22**] for cycle 1/week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy.
LUNGS: Clear to percussion bilaterally with a few left basilar crackles.
ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  WBC 9, hemoglobin 13.2, hematocrit 41, platelet count 277,000.
BUN 23, creatinine 1.1, sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 106, CO2 of 28, glucose 83, INR 1.1, calcium 9.3, magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 3.2, CK 51.
His admission weight was 78.6 kg, and he received interleuken-2 at 600,000 international units per kilogram equaling 47.2 mU IV q.8h.
Given his history of borderline pulmonary function tests, radiation to the lung, and tuberculosis history we reduced his intravenous fluid rate and planned to limit fluid boluses secondary to concern regarding pulmonary toxicity.
He required the addition of dopamine to a maximum of 6 mcg/kg/min as well as Neo-Synephrine up to 3.5 mcg/kg/min to support his blood pressure.
On treatment day #5, his troponin was elevated - consistent with myocarditis - and he underwent an echocardiogram revealing left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 25% with global hypokinesis.
An echocardiogram was repeated on [**2152-5-30**] showing improvement in his ejection fraction to 45% to 55%.
He was initially maintained on vancomycin and Zosyn, and later changed to levofloxacin when sputum culture grew Enterobacter with appropriate sensitivities.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, status post cycle 1/week 1 high-dose IL-2 complicated by hypotension and respiratory failure due to capillary leak syndrome.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 62385**] will return to clinic in approximately 1 month for CT scans to assess disease response.
