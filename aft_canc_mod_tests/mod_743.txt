HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of mantle cell lymphoma, blastic variant, who presented on [**2173-3-11**] with fevers and a white blood cell count of 1.2.
The patient was status post two cycles of hyper-CVAD therapy with a downtrending white blood cell count from this therapy.
A laboratory workup at that time showed him to be anemic with mantle cells in his peripheral smear.
A computed tomography scan showed diffuse mediastinal, axillary, retroperitoneal, and deep pelvis lymphadenopathy.
The patient presented for a computed tomography scan for further workup of a nodule noted on chest x-ray.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 100.5, his blood pressure was 140/82, his heart rate was 88, his respiratory rate was 16, and his oxygen saturation was 92% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed perioral lesions, multiple buccal lesion.
Chest examination revealed crackles at the bases bilaterally.
Otherwise, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Sputum was sent for culture.
Due to the patient's renal insufficiency, a computed tomography scan was not immediately obtained.
A computed tomography scan without contrast was eventually obtained on [**2173-3-13**].
In addition, the patient's white blood cell count continued to fall; which was expected from his prior chemotherapy.
The patient's hematocrit dropped from 30 to 18 on [**2173-3-13**].
This responded to blood transfusions.
An Ear/Nose/Throat consultation was obtained, and the nose bleed was well controlled by keeping the patient's platelets above 50 and his hematocrit above 30.
The patient [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a bronchoscopy on [**2173-3-15**].
Specimens from the lavage were negative for acid-fast bacilli.
Legionella culture was negative.
In addition, multiple blood cultures obtained from the patient during fever spikes remained negative for bacteria.
The sputum culture was negative for respiratory pathogens.
On [**2173-3-17**], he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for his worsening pulmonary function and for persistent atrial fibrillation (as described below).
His lungs had crackles at the bases, and his jugular venous pressure was minimally elevated.
An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed atrial fibrillation.
This transiently kept the patient under a heart rate of 100.
Due to the inability of maintaining the patient's heart rate below 100, he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a plan to start a diltiazem drip.
