On admission he was septic and hypotensive requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation to support his blood pressure, volume status, and maintain his urine output.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and they did not indicate that the patient was having a myocardial infarction.
A RUQ U/S revealed hypoechoic lesions in the liver that were consistent with metastatic cancer to the liver.
Due to his acute renal failure further CT imaging was initially deferred to allow his kidney function to return to baseline.
