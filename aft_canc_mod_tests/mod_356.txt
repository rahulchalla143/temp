Blood vessels with thick hyalinized walls are present.
EKG [**11-24**]: Sinus rhythm Modest diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave changes Since previous tracing of [**2118-11-16**], rate faster, and ST-T wave changes present.
Imaging: MRI Head [**11-18**]: IMPRESSION: Cystic mass with enhancing mural nodule within cerebellum most suggestive of hemangioblastoma.
Head CT [**11-19**]: IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes as described above.
MRI Head [**11-20**]: IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes in the posterior fossa.
MRI Head [**11-25**]: IMPRESSION: Status post resection of cerebellar mass with no definite residual nodular enhancement seen when accounting for blood products and vascular enhancement at the surgical site.
Small area of blood products in the right frontal lobe as seen on the recent CT at the site of previously placed ventricular drain.
CT head [**11-29**]: (Preliminary) No new intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect seen.
CXR [**11-29**]: (Preliminary) Pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
CXR [**11-30**]:   Brief Hospital Course: 50M electively admitted for resection of his L occipital brain mass.
POD5 ([**11-23**]) Drain removed without incident, exam stable.
POD6 ([**11-24**]) Bilateral lateral gaze deficit with intact visual fields, Right facial droop w/tongue deviation, difficulty closing right eye; patient states since surgery.
POD7/1 ([**11-25**]) Exam was stable from pre-op.
Stat head CT done for headache was normal.
POD10/4 ([**11-28**]) exam essentially stable with improvemnt in tongue deviation, and EOM.
POD11/5 ([**11-29**]) Exam was stable, however patient was more sleepy,  Patient was febrile overnight to 101.6 and fever work up ensued.
Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe consolidation.
Lower extremity duplex was negative for DVT.
Head CT negative.
Repeat chest x-ray shows no interval increase in right lower lobe consolidation.
