A head MRI showed a mass centering on the left nasopharynx, suggestive of lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or minor salivary gland tumor.
ENT performed a flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy which showed a virtually complete L>R nasopharyngeal obstruction.
Family History: n/c  Physical Exam: VS: T 95.1 HR 86 BP 142/89 RR 20 O2 sat 100% RA AC 500/12 PEEP 5  FiO2 100%.
Pertinent Results: LP 3 WBC, 1 RBC, 0 poly, 92 lymphs, 8 monos 29 protein, 62 glucose .
Imaging: MRI Neck w/wo contrast Gadolinium ([**1-23**]): Extensive enhancing T1  isointense, T2 hyperintense mass centering on the left nasopharynx, with local tumor extension into the ipsilateral parapharyngeal, carotid, and masticator spaces.
In the clinical setting of an  HIV positive patient, diagnostic possibilities include lymphoma,  nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and less likely, minor salivary gland  tumor.
A follow up thin section CT of the neck is a useful study  to assess bony involvement.
CT chest w/ contrast [**2-5**]: 1.
Given the patient's history of nasopharyngeal neoplasm, a three-month followup non-contrast CT of the chest is recommended for further assessment of this finding.
Review of the touch imprints shows atypical lymphoid cells, some with cytoplasmic vacuolation.
CD56 stains a rare NK cell, while CD3 and CD5 stain scattered T-cells.
ECHO TTE [**2199-2-7**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure.
[**2199-2-8**]: CXR IMPRESSION: Satisfactory position of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
Diagnostic morphologic features of involvement by lymphoma are NOT seen.
WBC count is normal.
His CT torso negative for other areas of disease, CSF cytology negative.
His tumor responded well to chemotherapy and his tumor lysis labs were checked per protocol w/out observed abnormalities.
He will receive Neulasta the day after discharge, in the [**Hospital 3242**] medical floor, and a CBC will be checked.
A TTE (trans thoracic echocardiogram) revealed a normal ejection fraction.
His measured HIV VL was < 50 copies/mL with CD4 ct 304, and his HIV test is pending at discharge (for our records).
