A 6-pack of platelets was transfused on POD #1.
Imaging studies included:  [**12-28**] CT HEAD w/o CONTRAST 1.
[**12-28**] CT C-spine No evidence of C-spine fracture.
Interval CT scan showed no change in the size of the subdural hematoma: [**12-29**] CT HEAD There is again noted a small left posterior parietooccipital extra-axial hyperdensity, which is either unchanged or smaller than when compared to the prior study.
Left femur radiographs were also obtained which showed further potential for pathological fracture: [**12-29**] Findings concerning for infiltrative process in the left femur, with mild endosteal scalloping of the proximal medial cortex.
Attempts were made twice to obtain MRI imaging of his R leg to r/o hematoma compressing the peroneal/sciatic nerves.
On [**2138-1-3**] he received 2 units FFP, 1 pack of platelets, and 2 units PRBC to correct his INR and raise his hematorcrit.
Patient was followed by oncology service who requested goal INR=1.1 and platelets >80.
Transfusion record is as follows:  -Transfuse 2 unit(s) Frozen Plasma Indication: Factor deficiency (including liver disease) and patient actively bleeding or facing hemostatic challenge, INR > 1.5 [**1-3**] @ 1201 View  -Transfuse Platelets (1 apheresis product) Post-transfusion platelet count to be drawn within one hour of transfusion.
Transfusion instructions: transfuse over 1 hour Indication: Bleeding with platelet count < 100K/ul:   s/p BMT [**1-3**] @ 1201 View  -Transfuse 2 unit(s) Red Cells over 4 hour(s).
Indication: Hematocrit < 25% in a normovolemic patient and no medical complications [**1-3**] @ 1201 View  -Transfuse Platelets (1 apheresis product)  Post-transfusion platelet count to be drawn within one hour of transfusion.
Transfusion instructions: transfuse over 2 hours Indication: Other circumstances - specify:   s/p BMT, postop bleeding  Most recent platelet count 69* of [**2138-1-2**] 6:07 AM [**1-2**] @ 1431 View  -Transfuse 2 unit(s) Frozen Plasma Indication: Operative or postoperative bleeding and INR > 1.5 [**1-2**] @ 1431 View  -Transfuse 2 unit(s) Red Cells over 4 hour(s).
Transfusion instructions: transfuse over 4 hours please    Indication: Falling hematocrit or acute blood loss in a patient with unstable blood volume:   falling HCt in postop patient  On [**2138-1-6**], he regained some motor strength of his [**Last Name (un) 938**] and TA ([**3-2**]) and continued to be vascularly intact, with clean incision, and sensation grossly intact throughout.
