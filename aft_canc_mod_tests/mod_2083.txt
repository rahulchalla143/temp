HEAD CT [**2134-5-26**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2134-5-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Follow-up ultrasound surveillance is recommended in one year.
Stable ventricular dimensions since the recent MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**5-27**],[**2133**]  CT HEAD [**2134-5-31**]: IMPRESSION: Expected small amount of bleeding and pneumocephalus in the right frontal region related to a right-sided biopsy.
CT HEAD [**2134-6-1**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT HEAD [**2134-6-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Status post biopsy from right frontal approach with a small amount of subarachnoid blood; stable appearance of intraparenchymal blood from a prior biopsy site.
Although he had poorly-localizing "frontal" findings on his mental status exam, these were apparently not new (per family and patient), and overall his exam was not suggestive of a new brain lesion; this was more or less incidentally discovered on OSH ED NCHCT.
MRI here did not make a definitive diagnosis (high-grade glioma versus lymphoma versus other), and the dexamethasone he had been started on was stopped due to the possibility of lymphoma.
The second biopsy (done on [**6-4**]) was diagnostic for glioblastoma multiforme.
Patient's neuro exam has improved s/p biopsy, but has now stabilized.
This lesion was biopsied with a needle, but the results were not diagnostic, so a larger biopsy was obtained on [**6-4**] and the final pathology showed glioblastoma multiforme (brain tumor).
