She subsequently presented to the Emergency Department, where she was found to have a hematocrit of 18.
A NG lavage was negative for active bleeding.
She was sent to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring and transfusions and received 6 units of red blood cells, vitamin K, 4 units of FFP and remained hemodynamically stable.
Her INR slowly trended down and she was awaiting a colonoscopy and EGD to find the source of bleeding.
History of diastolic dysfunction, echo from [**Month (only) 1096**]    [**2184**] with an EF of 60 percent.
Vitamin K.   PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature is 98.8, blood pressure 138/60 to 160/74, heart rate 60 to 72, respirations 20, O2 saturation 96 to 97 percent on room air, and fingersticks 93 to 102.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  Notable for an initial hematocrit of 18.2, which slowly trended up to the low 30s.
At the time of transfer, her hematocrit was 30.3.
Her INR was initially and 4.0 trended down to 1.5.
Creatinine was initially 3.3 and trended down to 2.7.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with stable improvement of CHF.
GI bleeding:  Her GI bleeding was felt to likely be    related to her INR of 4 on Coumadin and was suspected that    it was related to her previously known colonic polyps as a    source of this bleeding.
Her Coumadin was held and her    INR slowly drifted down and her hematocrit remained stable    for the rest her hospital course.
She had a colonoscopy    on [**2185-6-28**] showing rectal polyps, ascending colonic    polyp, mid transverse polyp, which were all removed and    she had a biopsy of the distal transverse colon.
Renal:  Her BUN and creatinine are slightly elevated at    the time of admission, which improved to her baseline    prior to admission.
She was told that if she develops any bloody stools, black tarry stools, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms that she should notify her PCP immediately and seek immediate medical attention.
