Ongoing workup led to an esophagogastroduodenoscopy to rule out celiac disease on [**2-13**].
He felt warm, but no temperature was taken.
Emergency Department CT scan showed free air in the abdomen.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient has a temperature of 99.7.
Heart rate 125.
Blood pressure 98/48.
Respiratory rate 24.
Satting 98% on room air.
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 9.5, hematocrit 30.6.
Liver function tests are normal.
Abdominal CT shows free air in the abdomen, although no other pathology.
Prior to surgery the patient did spike a temperature of 101.4.
He was taken to the Operating Room on [**2126-2-15**] where exploratory laparotomy was performed with a preop diagnosis of perforated viscus, postoperative diagnosis of large and small bowel lymphoma with descending colon perforation.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further care.
A PET scan on [**2-13**] showed new increased uptake on the right SM region.
He was transfused multiple units of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen platelets.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed ruling out gallbladder pathology.
The patient spiked a temperature for which his Swan was discontinued and tip was sent for culture.
On the last day of the month the patient's experienced a drop in blood pressure and tachycardia as well as a fever.
It was initially thought that he may have been overdiuresed, although because of the increase in fever blood cultures were sent and his central line was changed over a wire and then eventually removed and tip sent for culture.
Blood cultures came back with MRSA as well as the cath tip.
Per oncology's recommendation the patient underwent an MRI to look for central nervous system involvement of his lymphoma.
MRI was essentially negative and LP was performed.
Lumbar puncture showed a low white blood cell count and low protein indicating low likelihood of central nervous system involvement by his lymphoma.
Vancomycin was added due to the blood culture positive for MRSA.
