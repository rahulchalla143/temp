The post- myelogram CT of the thoracic and cervical spine reconfirmed that there is complete block of contrast within the subarachnoid space at the T4/5 level.
A promient echogenic area is seen overlying the right ventricular free wall which likely represents epicardial fat (cannot exclude thrombus or tumor if this is clinically suggested).
Serial evaluation is suggested.
Chest CT on [**7-18**] showed debris in the distal L mainstem bronchus consistent with aspirated material.
CTA was negative for PE.
The combination of locally advanced esophageal cancer and weakened chest muscles leading to poor cough predispose to recurrent, significant aspiration.
