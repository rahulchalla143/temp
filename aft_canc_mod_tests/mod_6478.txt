Blood Cultures x 4 No growth to date CXR: [**2164-1-5**] (after pneumostat placed): A very small left apical pneumothorax has, in retrospect, improved from the prior study.
With the exception of the change in pneumothorax, there are no other relevant changes since the recent radiograph of earlier the same date.
Chest film showed small basilar effusion/atelectasis for which pulmonary toilet was continued The anterior chest tube airleak persist.
She was transferred to the SICU for bronchoscopy revealed no evidence of the dehiscence or any anastomotic leak with saline instilled.
On POD4 the basilar chest tube was removed.
POD5 the chest tube was placed to water-seal a chest x-ray showed a stable left apical pneumothorax and left lower lobe atelectasis.
She was followed by serial chest films, pulmonary toilet continued, tolerated a regular diet and her pain was well controlled with PO Dilaudid.
A post CXR showed no increase in PTX/effusion.
An EKG was done which was normal.
In addition one set of cardiac enzymes was normal was well.
CXR shows no PTX.
