XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2192-12-2**] 12:25 PM FINDINGS: There is a rounded opacity in the right upper lobe.
The cardiac silhouette, hilar and mediastinal contours appear within normal limits.
Recommend repeat chest radiograph after appropriate treatment to assess for resolution.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2192-12-3**] 5:07 AM Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to [**2192-12-2**].
The right upper lobe rounded opacity appears to be slightly bigger than on the prior study and might be consistent with gradual progression of infectious process.
[**2192-12-6**]: MRI BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The study is very limited, with incomplete diffusion imaging.
Non-contrast sagittal T1-weighted images show no mass effect or hematoma.
BCs, Sputum cultures, Urine legionella Ag was negative.
WBC downtrending on hospital day 2 but CXR ppeared slightly worse with evidence of left base consolidation.
He will need a repeat CXR in [**3-6**] weeks to monitor for resolution.
