His platelet count continued to increase to 750 which was likely evidence of an acute phase reactant and sign of an infection.
Oxygen requirement remained stable at 3-4L but patient continued to experience episodes of acute tachypnea, excess secretions.
HCP also decided that if condition were to worsen/episodes become sustained or more frequent than comfort care would be immediately initiated.
Urine cultures from [**2108-2-17**], [**2108-2-18**], and [**2108-2-20**] showed no growth.
There was air in the left kidney on CT [**2108-2-21**], which was concerning for pneumopyelonephritis, but per final CT read this was likely iatrogenic and not pathological.
