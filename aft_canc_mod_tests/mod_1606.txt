He denied lightheadedness, chest pain, fevers, chills, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
He had a colonoscopy two years ago which showed diverticulosis.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 **] ED, his vitals were 138/83, 62, 16, 98.1.
EGD was negative for bleeding, but colonsocopy showed significant amount of bleeding but there were unable to localize source of bleed due to significant amounts of blood.
He got 2 units of FFP though his INR was 1.6.
His Hct at [**Hospital1 **] on arrivals was 30.9. .
In the ED, vitals on arrival were T 96.5, BP 108/70, 16, 100% on RA.

# GI bleed/colitis:  His GI bleed was localized to the sigmoid colon or rectal colon on tagged RBC.
His hematocrit nadired at 24 but was 31 at the time of discharge and remained stable.
He underwent colonoscopy that demonstrated diverticulosis and mild colitis of the sigmoid colon of unknown etiology, but no active source of bleeding was identified.
He also underwent an angiography study that was also unable to localize the bleeding source.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular resopnse:  He is anticoagulated at baseline and had an INR of 1.6 on the day of presentation.
He also had episdoes of a. fib with RVR and required a dilt drip intermittently but was placed back on metoprolol once his heart rate stabilized, as he takes this at home.
We treated you with blood transfusions and also performed a colonoscopy, which showed that you have some inflammation in a small part of your colon.
