CXR [**2118-11-17**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
Normal size and shape of the mediastinal structures and the cardiac silhouette.
CXR [**2118-11-19**] Overall, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
The interstitium appears slightly prominent throughout both lungs but when compared to multiple previous studies given differences in technique, this is not likely significantly changed.

P/w cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, fatigue, and fever of 100.5 suggestive of viral infection.
CXR, UA, cultures, viral swabs were all negative.
CT chest showed bilateral extensive opacities, concerning for multifocal bacterial pneumonia, less likely fungal infection.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] transferred to the ICU, electively intubated for bronchoscopy, which showed 1+ GPC and 1+ GNR, and negative PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] which point Bactrim and prednisone were discontinued.
B-glucan and galactomannan were negative, urine Legionella and Histo Ab negative.
[**Location (un) **] virus antibodies still pending at time of discharge.
BAL cultures did not grow any organisms.
CT chest showed extensive bilateral opacities concerning for multifocal bacterial pneumonia, viral infection vs fluid overload with multiple transfusions.
CXR began to clear after diuresis with lasix and auto-diuresis, and patient was extubated without complications.
TTE showed newly decreased EF of 35-40% (see cardiomyopathy, below).
# Cardiomyopathy- In the setting of respiratory failure responsive to diuresis, a repeat ECHO was obtained with showed biventricular and global hypokinesis (new compared to [**5-/2118**]) and EF 35-40%.
#hypotension - on admission, pt had SBP from high 80s to 120s.
After pt was called out to the floor she had SBP in the high 70s.
Pt was monitored on telemetry without arrhythmia or other events, HR initially fluctuated between 60 and low 100s and then stabilized to remain in roughly the 80s range.
transaminase levels peaked towards the end of [**Month (only) **] and trendeding back to baseline.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Pt had TSH and AM cortisol sent for evaluation of hypotension.
Since then they have come back showing TSH of 2.8 and cortisol of 26.6, slightly elevated.
A CT scan of your chest showed a pneumonia located in multiple different areas, and because of that it became more and more difficult for you to breathe.
During your stay in the ICU your white blood cell counts recovered and were back to normal.
You came back to the floor and continued to recover, however your blood pressure was low.
An echocardiogram of your heart showed that your heart was not functioning as well as it had been the last time we looked at this in [**Month (only) **].
We think your low blood pressures were due to a combination of the heart function and being dehydrated.
Your blood pressure remained stable although on the low side, and you were able to walk around and drink enough fluids on your own to keep it in the normal range.
