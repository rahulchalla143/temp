Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2180-6-19**], the pericaridal effusion is now smaller.

The patient had a CTA on admission that demonstrated no PE.
The patient was supported with oxygen to maintain an O2 sat > 90%.
An autopsy was offered but declined.
All blood cultures throughout admission were negative.
The patient had undergone an echocardiogram that was first interpreted to reveal an echogenic intrluminal mass, thought to represent thrombus.
Review of the study and ultimately a venogram revealed instead extraluminal compression of the IVC, likely from her metastatic disease.
