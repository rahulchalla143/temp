Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-6-15**], estimated PA pressures are higher still and RV appears slightly more dilated.

# Critical AS: valve area = 0.4, peak gradient 100.
Post-procedure, TTE demonstrated overall normal left ventricular systolic function, (LVEF>55%).
HIT antibody returned negative and patient restarted on heparin gtt on [**6-20**].
Post-procedure patient noted to be hypotension with MAPS in 50s and SBPs in 80s necessitating pressure support.
Initial hypotension attributed to fluid shifts s/p core valve and blood pressure augmented with neo.
Patients 4 T score ~6 (especially after UE US with evidence of new left brancial thrombosis).
CT with evidence of renal infarct thought to have occurred intra-procedure.
Patients kidney function was monitored daily, medications were renally dosed.
Cr stabilized around 4.8 and urine output improved transiently on a lasix gtt before the patient began to deteriorate and urine output again declined.
Pre-procedure chest CT and severe pulmonary HTN on RHC which showed PA systolic pressure of 80mmHg in the presence of nopmal wedge pressure (16mmHg).
# Hypothyroidism: TSH [**4-/2119**] = 2.6.
