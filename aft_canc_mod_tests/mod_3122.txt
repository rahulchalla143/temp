Echo and cardiac catheterization were notable for increased pulmonary artery hypertension.
The patient was admitted primarily for work-up of new chest x-ray and chest CAT scan findings which were diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities, bibasilar thickening of the interlobar septa with honeycombing.
Chest x-ray upon transfer to the MICU was notable for a new right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with air space disease, most likely lung injury.
lap 2 years ago to evaluate abdominal pain.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON TRANSFER TO MICU:  Notable for vital signs - T-max 99.8?????
?F, blood pressure ranged systolic 84-123/45-91, heart rate range 103-140, respiratory rate 24, 89-95% on 4 L nasal cannula and shovel mask.
Exam was notable for anicteric sclerae.
Her neck exam - JVP approximately 10 cm at 45?????
Pulmonary exam - decreased breath sounds at bases, no crackles, no wheezes.
Cardiac exam - regular, tachycardia, S1, S2, II/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
Abdominal exam benign.
Extremity exam -  1+ pretibial edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally, positive clubbing of the upper digits, no calf tenderness, no swelling.
Neurologic exam grossly intact.
STUDIES [**2167-10-5**]:  Echocardiogram - ejection fraction 55-60%, right ventricular dilatation, moderate global right ventricular hypokinesis, moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension.
[**2167-11-4**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:  Right ventricular filling pressures 55/7, pulmonary artery pressure 55/26, with a mean of 39, mean wedge 6, left ventricular pressure 81/10, cardiac output 4.9, cardiac index 2.8, pulmonary vascular resistance 536.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  As mentioned, CAT scan notable for ground glass opacities bibasilar.
Chest x-ray notable for a new right lower lobe infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM - 1) PRIMARY PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, STATUS POST RIGHT LOWER LOBE WEDGE RESECTION FOR WORK-UP OF NEW RADIOGRAPHIC LUNG FINDINGS AND PROGRESSIVE DYSPNEA ON EXERTION:  The patient was initially treated with Flolan with a short course of inhaled nitric oxide treatment in the setting of her acute dyspnea.
The patient's pathology was notable for evidence of pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.
The patient's chest x-ray did not change remarkably.
The patient's hematocrit was stable.
Her oxygen saturation improved while weaning her O2 requirement.
The patient did have a recent cardiac catheterization from [**2167-11-4**] which did not reveal any evidence of critical stenoses in her coronary arteries.
The patient was continued on her digoxin with her dig level at 0.6 on transfer to the MICU.
This was presumed to be in relation to diuresis, as well as her Flolan treatment which is a common side-effect.
Therefore, she was not aggressively treated for this, and her EKG did not reveal any abnormalities.
Her hematocrit remained stable, and her chest x-ray did not change in appearance.
