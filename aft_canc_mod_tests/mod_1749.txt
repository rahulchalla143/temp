He had a large peri portal lymph node which made him unresectable essentially for cure prior to treatment but this was negative on PET CT after his treatment and therefore he became an operative candidate.
It was thought that he may have enough residual disease in his stomach, as noted by PET CT that he may need much more extensive dissection of the stomach and that a minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy may not be feasible.

FINDINGS: An initial scout image demonstrates removal of the previously placed nasogastric tube.
Thin barium was administered orally to the patient, and fluoroscopic spot images of the esophageal-jejunal anastomosis obtained.
IMPRESSION: Status post esophagojejunostomy and total gastrectomy, without evidence of leak at the esophageal-jejunal anastomosis.
Stomach (V-AA): 1.
His blood pressure in the ICU required fluid bolus and norepinephrine.
POD 1 - the patient remained in the ICU with IVF, NGT, foley, epidural but norepinephrine was discontinued and his blood pressure remained stable.
POD 3 - Epidural catheter removed, foley catheter removed.
POD 4 - Barium swallow performed, limited study showed no leak at the anastamosis site.
POD 5 - Repeat swallow study showed free passage of fluid and no leak.
POD 6 -  advanced to regular diet - no breads, bulky, sharp or tough foods, no carbonated beverages.
