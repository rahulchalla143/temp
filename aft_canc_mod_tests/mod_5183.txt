Due to her persistent hypotension, however, the epidural was d/c'd on POD 2 and she was transitioned to a dilaudid PCA with PO percocet, tizanidine, toradol, and gabapentin.
Her pain control did improve each subsequent hospital day with adjustments to the doses and frequency of these medications.
CV:  Blood pressure augmented with phenylephrine gtt postoperatively.
Resp:  Extubated early morning of POD 1, maintaining O2 saturations > 95% on 2L nasal cannula / face tent, then room air.
Chest tubes x2 to right chest were maintained to suction for the first 24 hours postoperatively and then transitioned to waterseal.
A CXR on POD 1 demonstrated small right pneumothorax and the chest tubes were placed back to suction.
On POD 2 the chest tubes were again placed to waterseal and did demonstrate a persistent but stable small air leak.
The CXR showed slight increase in apical pneumothorax and a hydropneumothorax.
Followed by serial chest films.
On POD8 the basilar chest-tube was clamped x 24 hrs, CXR showed stable pneumothorax.
On POD9 the basilar chest-tube was removed follow-up CXR showed a stable PTX.
