He was noted to be in pulmonary edema on examination and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for evaluation and treatment of his pulmonary edema and possible transfusion for low hematocrit.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be with a oxygen saturation in the low 90s on 50% trach mask.
He also was given Lasix 60 mg times one with good urine output 500 cc in the first two hours and 750 cc total.
Vital signs revealed temperature 97.2, blood pressure 104/48, pulse 83, oxygen saturation 97% on 50% trach mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 23.9, platelets 598,000, white blood cell count 9.2.
Sodium 141, potassium 5.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate 20, blood urea nitrogen 81, creatinine 1.1, glucose 90.

Prothrombin time 14.2, partial thromboplastin time 35.4, INR 1.3.
CK #1 was 50.
Total bilirubin 0.85, LDH 229, transferrin low 2.02, folate 43.7, haptoglobin 81, TIBC 45, iron 4.0, reticulocyte count 3.0% on [**2123-9-17**].
Urinalysis - specific gravity 1.009, positive blood, [**4-5**] white blood cells, negative bacteria, negative nitrites.
TSH on [**2123-9-2**], was 26.
Chest x-ray - right loculated effusion, increased left effusion.
Electrocardiogram - ventricular paced electrocardiogram,  Transthoracic echocardiogram from [**2123-8-18**], revealed an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, severe left ventricular hypokinesis, decreased right ventricular systolic function, 2+ aortic insufficiency, prosthetic mitral valve and tricuspid valve, positive ascites, positive left pleural effusions.
Catheterization [**2123-4-6**], revealed ejection fraction of 35%, global left ventricular hypokinesis, 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation, right coronary artery normal, obtuse marginal normal, left anterior descending normal, circumflex 90% stenosis proximally, patch pericardiac calcifications, right atrium 22/24/19, right ventricle 38/19, left ventricle 108/19, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 20/20/18, cardiac output 3.1, cardiac index 1.7.
Cardiovascular - Myocardium - The patient's ejection fraction postoperative was 20 to 25% with severe left ventricular hypokinesis.
On admission, he had pulmonary edema and it was decided to continue to diurese him with a goal of negative two liters by the next day.
It was attempted to diurese him but he seemed intravascularly dry with blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio of 80.
It was felt that his fluid was all third spaced.
He was continued on this regimen of medications until [**2123-9-28**], with systolic blood pressure of 60 to 80s.
His blood pressure was thought to be low because he was intravascularly dry secondary to continual third spacing of all fluids.
His blood pressure was difficult to maintain because there was a 20 point systolic blood pressure difference between his right and left arm, his right being 20 points greater than the left arm, but unable to use right upper extremity for blood pressure measurements because his PICC line was in place.
Central venous pressure line was placed and was unable to go across the tricuspid valve replacement with a central venous pressure of 12, cardiac output of 7.1 and SVR of 700.
His Neo-Synephrine was maintained for five days and weaned to off on [**2123-10-3**], with systolic blood pressure in the 120s.
His mean arterial pressures were 60 to 70.
with systolic blood pressure in the 120/50 range.
Repeat echocardiogram on [**2123-9-28**], showed an ejection fraction of less than 25% with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
His blood cultures did not grow anything.
His fluid balance goal continued to be negative 500 to negative one liter.
On [**2123-10-10**], his Lasix drip was stopped secondary to a bump in his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine up to 115 and 1.7.
On [**2123-10-11**], it was felt that the patient was dry and his goal fluid status was changed to euvolemic to positive over 24 hours.
On [**2123-10-11**], his right femoral arterial line was taken out and his blood pressure was being able to be monitored on his right arm despite his PICC line.
His urine output was also low so he was bolused 250 cc of normal saline three times.
Coronary arteries - The patient's last catheterization was [**2123-4-16**], showing one vessel coronary artery disease which was stented.
Conduction - The patient has a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with inducible ventricular tachycardia on electrophysiology study.
The patient will need pulmonary function tests at some point as an outpatient because of the possible side effect of pulmonary fibrosis with Amiodarone.
His electrolytes remained fairly stable throughout his hospital stay and were repleted as needed.
His goal INR is 2.5.
The patient was subtherapeutic on admission, was given Lovenox on the day of admission, but was started on Heparin drip while he was in the hospital until his therapeutic INR was reached.
He continued to require frequent suctioning and sputum was sent for culture.
In addition, the patient's chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary edema and possibly pneumonia.
His white blood cell count began to increase in the first few days of hospitalization.
At that point, his sputum culture was positive for Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and it was decided to treat that for ten days.
He then maintained good oxygenation with 95% oxygen saturation on 15 liters of FIO2, 50% trach mask.
Chest x-ray on [**2123-9-30**], was consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and right lower lobe pneumonia.
CT showed pleural herniation, no lung tissue.
CT surgery indicated that the left sided bulge was stable and that there was nothing to be done for it.
The patient's Vancomycin was held on [**2123-10-4**], for a high level of 42.3.
His repeat chest x-ray on [**2123-10-6**], showed decreased bilateral pleural effusions and no change in his right middle lobe infiltrate.
CT surgery indicated that the left bulge is a chest wall defect intercostal with no lung present on CT scan.
The patient failed the trach valve again on [**2123-10-11**], and the plan was for interventional pulmonology to scope to look for an obstruction causing this failure with the valve, however, on [**2123-10-12**], a new tracheostomy was placed, this time size #4, and on [**2123-10-13**], the  trach valve was retried with success, having the patient talk without it popping off.
On [**2123-10-13**], it was noted that the left chest wall bulge was increased in size and was firmer.
Renal - The patient's blood urea nitrogen and creatinine on admission appeared to be at his baseline, however, he was also felt to be intravascularly dry with a high ratio of blood urea nitrogen/creatinine on [**2123-9-24**], with third spacing of his fluids so there was an increase in his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine over the next three to four days with decreased urine output not responding to Lasix.
On [**2123-9-28**], his blood urea nitrogen/creatinine peaked at 137/2.2.
He was started on Dopamine which was changed to Neo-Synephrine with increased urine output of greater than 150 cc/hour for two days.
Urine output started to decrease so he was transitioned to Lasix boluses which was then changed to Lasix drip with continued good urine output.
His blood urea nitrogen/creatinine decreased over three to four days to 71/1.3.
His creatinine clearance on [**2123-10-2**], was 24 via a 24 hour collection.
On [**2123-10-7**], the patient's goal net fluid balance was negative 500 to negative one liter.
His potassium was kept above 4.0.
On [**2123-10-10**], since the patient was felt to be dry, his goal fluid balance was changed to positive/neutral and the Lasix drip was discontinued.
On [**2123-10-10**], his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 115 and 1.7.
Even after the Lasix drip was discontinued, the patient's blood urea nitrogen and creatinine continued to be elevated with blood urea nitrogen of 100 and creatinine 1.6 on discharge.
Anticoagulation wise, he was placed on a Heparin drip.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed gastritis and Barrett's esophagus but no active bleeding.
The patient did have a low haptoglobin and hemolysis workup was done.
Initially his hemolysis laboratories were negative as was his bronchoscopy negative for active bleeding.
The patient's hematocrit fluctuated between 26.0 and 30.0 and he received two units of packed red blood cells on [**2123-9-29**].
On [**2123-9-28**], in the setting of decreased systolic blood pressure and increased hypoxia, central arterial access and central venous access was attempted and after multiple sticks bilaterally, right femoral artery and right femoral CVL were obtained, however, the patient received a right femoral hematoma, small and well circumscribed, and a left large hematoma, but remained clinically stable.
Since [**2123-9-28**], and [**2123-10-6**], the patient received a total of six units of packed red blood cells for hematocrit between 24.0 and 30.0.
On [**2123-10-3**], he received two units of packed red blood cells with increased hematocrit to 27.0 which decreased to 24.0 two days later.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained on [**2123-10-5**], showing left groin hematoma and right psoas hematoma, 4.0 by 4.0 centimeters.
Goal partial thromboplastin time was low 50s.
The patient was guaiac negative on [**2123-10-6**].
Ultrasound of his groin was negative for pseudoaneurysm and it was decided on [**2123-10-6**], to recheck his hematocrit at noon because of decreased from 32.0 to 28.0.
His noon hematocrit on [**2123-10-6**], was 30.7 so it was decided not to lavage his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy fluid and he was not transfused.
Since his noon hematocrit was 30.7 on [**2123-10-6**], it was decided to transfuse for less than 27.0 or 28.0.
Direct Coombs test and haptoglobin, LDH and indirect bilirubin were checked.
On [**2123-10-8**], the patient was noted to have bright red blood coming out of his tracheostomy.
Haptoglobin was low and direct bilirubin was normal.
On [**2123-10-10**], the patient was transfused one unit of blood for hematocrit of 26.9.
His hematocrit did not bump very much with this and he went up to 27.6.
It was decided to recheck his hematocrit at noon on [**2123-10-11**], and transfuse if less than 27.0, however, this was not needed.
The patient's hematocrit did bump to 31.2.
On [**2123-10-13**], the patient's hematocrit was 27.7 and it was decided to transfuse him one unit of blood, not so much for the thought of him actively bleeding anywhere, but more for intravascular volume.
The patient was guaiac negative on discharge.
Coumadin was given the afternoon of discharge as well 5 mg with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5 for valvular protection.
Culture was sent.
Sputum culture was positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
He was redosed for Vancomycin level of less than or equal to 15.0.

White blood cell count continued to decrease and he continued to remain afebrile until discharge.
On [**2123-10-13**], his Vancomycin trough level was 22.1.
His TSH was high at 87 and free T4 low at 0.8.
His thyroid function tests were rechecked on [**2123-10-7**].
In addition, endocrine consultation was obtained for adrenal crisis on [**2123-9-28**], in the setting of hypotension, decreased urine output and respiratory failure.
He was given a stress dose of steroids and drew random cortisol level which was 23.
On [**2123-10-7**], repeat thyroid function tests were done.
and asked for his thyroid function tests to be rechecked on [**2123-10-16**].
Video swallowing study from previous hospital admission showed positive aspiration.
Electrolytes were within normal limits on admission.
Nutrition was poor with low albumin of 1.7 and he was started on tube feeds.
His albumin continued to be low at 2.0 to 2.5.
On [**2123-10-11**], his goal fluid balance was then changed to positive/euvolemic.
In discussion with his wife, it was decided to hold his antidepressants at this time.
Prophylaxis - The patient was turned regularly.
On CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, he was clinically stable.
Ultrasound showed no pseudoaneurysm and he was followed and the induration due to the hematoma did seem to decrease in size as did the tenderness.
His right PICC line remained in and will remain in because of his continued Vancomycin treatment but the nurses were able to measure blood pressure on his right arm.
Miconazole cream 2% apply to folds b.i.d.
q.d., hold for systolic blood pressure less than 85.
q.d., hold for pulse less than 50.
