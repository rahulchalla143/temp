STAT CT head showed the left IPH, so neurosurgery was consulted.
His initial BP was also in the 180s, so he was given Labetalol 20 mg IV for blood pressure control in the setting of hemorrhage.

Radiology: [**8-20**] Admission NC Head CT: IMPRESSION: Large left frontal/parietal parenchymal hemorrhage with minimal mass effect.
[**8-20**] Admission Head CTA: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**8-24**] CT Abd/Pelvis with and without contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
This lesion is amenable to ultrasound- guided biopsy 3.
[**8-24**] CT Chest with contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2195-9-2**] 5:11 AM IMPRESSION: Overall, minimal change re-demonstrating a large left parenchymal hemorrhage and associated mass effect.
A dedicated PA and lateral radiograph may be obtained if a pneumonia is a clinical concern.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2195-9-3**] 10:00 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of new hemorrhage.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2195-9-4**] 11:19 AM IMPRESSION: Recent placement of a left frontal approach VP shunt with the tip of the catheter terminating in the midline, slightly more anterior than on the prior study with associated postop pneumocephalus and small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2195-9-5**] 5:01 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Portable Abdominal Xray  [**2195-9-6**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
Hip 2 view Xray [**2195-9-8**] One AP view of the pelvis and two more views of the left hip are essentially normal.
Abdomen Xray [**2195-9-9**] Two views of the abdomen are provided.
The supine film shows a distended large bowel up to 8 cm.
EEG	Study Date of [**2195-8-25**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of focal attenuation and moderate diffuse background slowing over the left hemisphere, mild diffuse slowing over the right hemisphere, and frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
EEG	Study Date of [**2195-8-26**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of focal attenuation and moderate diffuse background slowing over the left hemisphere and mild diffuse slowing over the right hemisphere.
Compared to the prior day's recording, the focal slowing and attenuation were unchanged, and FIRDA was present but did not increase in frequency over the course of the recording.
EEG	Study Date of [**2195-8-27**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of focal attenuation and moderate focal background slowing over the left hemisphere and mild diffuse slowing over the right hemisphere.
His exam at admission was notable for right sided neglect, nonfluent aphasia but also with receptive defecits, possible right hemianopia, mild right NLF flattening, right sided hemiparesis and hemisensory loss.
His NCHCT showed a large left frontoparietal IPH that extended from the thalamus to the cortex and on further imaging was found to have multiple cerebral mets.
An EVD was inserted due to worsening ICH and it was not possible to remove this due to high ICP spikes.
Lymph node biopsy came back as adenocarcinoma.
Patient deteriorated and was transferred back to th ICU on [**2195-9-5**] due to increasing somnolence and CT showed worse edema and herniation.
Admission exam was notable for right sided neglect, nonfluent aphasia but also with receptive defecits, possible right hemianopia, mild right NLF flattening, right sided hemiparesis and hemisensory loss.
His NCHCT showed a large left frontoparietal IPH that extended from the thalamus to the cortex.
Given his history of HTN, with SBP of 180s on arrival, the most likely etiology was intially thought to be hypertensive.
The patient's conscious level decreased and repeat CT showed worsening of the ICH and associated edema and midline shift.
CSF showed normal protein, glucose.
Cell count and diff showed 60 WBCs and 4000 RBCs, PMN predominant.
Gram stain showed PMNs but no organisms grew on culture.
[**8-23**] MRI head with contrast was done that showed numerous enhancing foci in the bilateral occipital lobes and the right parietal/frontal lobe, concerning for metastatic disease.
CT torso showed a 6.2 cm right upper lobe mass, multiple lymph nodes, including a right supraclavicular lymph node and a left adrenal lesion.
On [**2195-8-25**], an ultra-sound guided supraclavicular lymph node biopsy was done at the bedside that showed metastatic adenocarcinoma, presumed to be primary lung cancer.
The medical oncology service was called for a formal evaluation of the patient's condition.
Patient self-extubated by coughing [**2195-8-25**] and maintained his airway well with reassuring sats on room air thereafter.
Patient deteriorated and was transferred back to th ICU on [**2195-9-5**] due to increasing somnolence and CT showed worse edema and herniation.
ONCOLOGY: The medical oncology service was called for a formal evaluation of the patient's condition.
Patient had a PEG inserted [**2195-9-8**].
Medications on Admission: -Amlodipine -Glipizide -Metformin -HCTZ -Lisinopril   Discharge Medications: 1. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Two (2)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Please follow up with neurosurgery in clinic and have a repeat head CT on [**10-8**].
We are currently tapering down the steroids you have been on as your neurological exam has been stable.
