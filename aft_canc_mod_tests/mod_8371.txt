69 y/o F w/ a h/o pansensitive TB on 3 drug regimen, MDS with pancytopenia, respiratory failure s/p trach placement and revision [**5-/2147**], recently admitted [**Date range (1) 102694**] with sepsis presumed [**12-23**] PNA (by MDR E coli, pseudomonas) who comes in from [**Hospital3 **] with increasing abdominal distension, drainage from GJ tube site and fever.
On last admission pts sputum grew out pan sensitive serratia and two strains of psudomonas.
Lowest BP noted at 90/53.
Pt sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Blood cx, coags, chem 7, UA and cx ordered.
Recent ID course: Prior cultures significant for MDR pseudomonas sensitive to Cipro from sputum [**6-10**] and MDR E coli sensitive (ESBL) to Meropenem from sputum [**6-9**].
Also, VRE from cath tip on [**6-21**], started on Daptomycin, however, daptomycin was discontinued due to negative blood cx for VRE on [**6-23**].
On last admission, sputum grew out pan sensitive serratia and two strains of pseudomonas.
ID course as above  -Pulm TB (pan sensitive) with liver/spleen granulomas - s/p R sided vats, r supraclavic LN, liver bx + - h/o +PPD w/o tx - AFB on BAL [**2147-1-2**] - tx continuous since 2/1 per prior dc summ - Diabetes mellitus - OSA - previously on BiPAP - Cataract left eye - CVA/TIA (positive MRI)[**11-27**] - right frontal with L arm/hand hemiparesis; etiology likely moderate degree stenosis of the ICA in the cavernous region, stable on recent CTA, hx of watershed infarcts during acute illness in the setting of acute disease - Asthma - Hypercholesterolemia - Seizure- uncertain diagnosis - L arm involuntary movements [**2144**], not on anti-seizure medications - Chronic renal insufficiency due to recurrent exposures to nephrotocxic medications/ contrast and hemodynamic instability in the context of recurrent sepsis, Creat on last discharge 2.6.
Physical Exam: VS: 100.1, HR 110, BP 95/45, RR 36 (36-41) GEN: NAD, unresponsive, not following commands NEURO: nonverbal, minimally withdraws to pain, eyes open, reflexes HEENT: PEERLA, 4mm pupils, L cataract, mmm, Dry mucous membranes  CARDS: S1S2, RR, tachycardic, no m/r/g CHEST: rhonchorus breath sounds throughout, expiratory wheeze.
Pertinent Results: ABG 7.41, 28, 351 .
PT: 15.0 PTT: 33.1 INR: 1.3 .
CXR [**2147-8-19**] No pneumothorax is identified.
CT Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Recent hx of pneumonia including pseudomonas, serratia - with recent ([**2147-7-23**]) sputum culture showing strain of pseudomonas resistant to meropenem and cefepime - sensitive only to tobramycin - received treatment at that time.
Subsequent sputum culture revealed pseudomonas pneumonia with sensitivities identical to prior hospitalizations.
CT scan negative for abscess or ileus.
She continued to have 1.5-2L of fluid output daily via the G-tube.
CT Scan again revealed no intra-abdominal abscess or fluid collections.
Intrabladder pressure was measured at 45, likely resultant from bowel edema, giving evidence of likely intra-abdominal compartment syndrome, however, given her tenuous blood pressure surgical decompression was not an option.
#Bleeding from trach site: Pt with platelets 14 on admission.
The day of death, her heart rate advanced to 150s but we were unable to slow her rate given concern for worsening hypotension.
Prior biopsy in [**2146-11-21**] showed progression with concern of impending AML conversion.
While inpatient, peripheral blood smear analysis gave no evidence for new leukemia.
Repeat CT Scan revealed progressive lymphadenopathy throughout the abdomen and thorax.
Began pursuing biopsy of lymph nodes, but were ultimately unable due to the severity of her illness.
She was treated aggressively with fluid resuscitation, antibiotics and pressors to maintain her blood pressure.
As her BP decreased to SBP 40s, she went into asystole.
Due to patient's critical condition, no diagnostic tests to assess for intra-abdominal pathology were feasible.
