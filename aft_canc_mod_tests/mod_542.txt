PCP was able to set up chest x-ray, CT scan of the chest, MRI of the brain.
Chest CT showing a near complete collapse of the left upper lobe of the lung, with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, and an MRI of the brain with multiple lesions consistent with likely metastasis.
Was going to have outpatient evaluation however had worsening SOB and referred to ED.
CT on [**2-2**] showed Left upper lobe collapse, concerning for bronchogenic carcinoma.
CXR shwoed left sided pleural effusion.
She became hypotensive to SBP 80 and received 1L NS with SBP coming up to low 90's.
Labs signficiant for WBC of 16, Cr of 1.9 (baseline 1.0), K of 2.6.

A cell block specimen  	(S12-4617D) was prepared in an attempt to better  	characterize the atypical cells, but these cells were not  	seen on the cell block preparation.
============== OTHER STUDIES ============== ECG [**2201-2-9**]: Baseline artifact.
Chest Radiograph [**2201-2-9**] IMPRESSION: 1.
However, there is now complete lobar collapse of the left lower lobe; these findings are new from prior CT though similar to multiple recent chest radiographs.
A calcified granuloma in the right lower lobe is stable as compared to prior examination (3J:71).
Interlobular septal thickening, ground-glass opacities, and micronodular opacities predominantly with a perifissural distribution have increased and now involve both the anterior and posterior aspects of the right upper lobe, and perifissural portions of the right middle and lower lobes.
However, an ill-defined hypodensity in segment [**Doctor First Name 690**]/VIII has increased in size, now measuring 2.1 x 2.0 cm as compared with 1.1 x 1.3 cm on the prior examination (3:98), findings concerning for progression of disease.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2201-2-20**] at 4:12:51 PM      FINAL The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-7-29**], findings now compatible with acute pulmonary embolism  Brief Hospital Course: 81F with a PMH significant for depression, HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism with significant pack-year smoking history who presented with progressive dyspnea and hypotension with increasing oxygen requirement in the context of recent diagnosis of likely metastatic lung cancer.
# Bronchogenic carcinoma with brain metastases: Patient presented with progressive dyspnea with CXR and CT imaging ([**2-2**]) confirming LUL collapse with no discrete mass identified, but most concerning for bronchogenic carcinoma associated with extensive hilar and mediastinal LAD.
MR imaging of the brain demonstrated multiple small enhancing foci in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres which likely represent metastases.
