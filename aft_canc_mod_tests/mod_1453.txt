She was noted to be in rapid Afib with rates 150s.
She was diagnosed with Afib in [**2-/2200**] with the workup resulting in her neuroendocrine lung cancer diagnosis during [**4-/2200**] hospitalization.
Subsequent CT showed large mediastinal mass.
She was transitioned from dabigatran to enoxaparin during that hospitalization in setting of biopsy and was kept on enoxaparin in case she might need a repeat procedure.
She was then given diltiazem 5mg IV push with BP 92/60, bringing HR down to 96.
During ED stay, systolic BPs ranged 87-104, appeared to have lower systolics with elevated HRs.
ECG showed Afib with NA NI, new ST depression lateral leads; repeat EKG unchanged.
CXR with stable right effusion vs elevation of right hemidiaphragm.
Troponin negative x1.
Labs also significant for WBC 1.3, Hct 35.3, Na 131.
Vitals in ED prior to transfer to floor were as follows: 104/66 114,afib 22 97% on 2L NC.
Her atrial fibrillation worsened despite uptitration of medication (sotalol and dronedarone)  and her repeat TTE showed a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] vs. extrinsic mass compressing on LA.
She was admitted for evaluation and her biopsy showed neuroendocrine tumor consistent with typical carcinoid.
- CT scan showing metastases to bone, lymph nodes and possibly liver.

Pulmonary vein compression cannot be excluded but is possible based on the location of the mass, as well as the pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular enlargement, and tricuspid regurgitation.
No prior echocardiographic study is available for comparison.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
# Atrial fibrillation/ Aflutter: Hemodynamically stable with HR in 70s-80s and SBPs 90s on arrival after IV Diltiazem and IVF were administered.
Her diltiazem was discontinued and her metoprolol was lowered.
A CXR showed a significant mass present in the right lung with a small effusion present.
She had a repeat TTE that better clarified her cardiac sequelae from this tumor; she is noted to have a normal EF but could have compression of the pulmonary veins.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
Transitional Issues:  - readmission on [**5-27**] for chemo/radiation - cardionet measurements/fitting and delivery to rehab (to be worn while at rehab) - requests a [**Hospital1 18**] PCP and cardiologist; appointments not made due to her planned readmission in a few days, at which point follow-up appointments should be made.
