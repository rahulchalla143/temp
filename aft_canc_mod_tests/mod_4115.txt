Shortly thereafter, he was admitted with an upper GI bleed, at which time his Coumadin was discontinued ([**2185-9-17**]).
In ED, T 98.6, HR 86, BP 100/58, RR 22, Sat 98% on 3L NC.
A CXR showed possible mild interstitial edema and a known left-sided effusion.
A CT chest was subsequently obtained, negative for PE or dissection, but remarkable for a large stable left-sided effusion.

ECHO [**10-28**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-2-19**], left ventricular systolic function appears similar (was underestimated on prior report).
CTA Chest: [**10-28**] CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, some of which are pathologically enlarged, including a prevascular node measuring 12 mm in shortest diameter seen on series 3, image 39, previously 8 mm in diameter.
There are enlarged pretracheal nodes that today measure 8 and 9 mm respectively seen on series 3, image 31, previously 6 and 7 mm respectively.
Marked aortic and coronary calcifications are again noted alongwith an artificial aortic valve.
Improved right pleural effusion compared to [**2184-2-19**] CT chest.
[**10-31**]: Stress test TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  4 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  69 SYMPTOMS: NONE INTERPRETATION: 74 yo man (h/o AVR and CABG in [**2182**]) was referred for a CAD evaluation prior to surgery.
The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with occasional VPDs noted during the procedure.
[**10-31**] CXR PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Compared to [**2185-10-27**] and CTA chest of [**2185-10-28**].
Apparent minimal increase in 2 mm diameter peripheral right upper lobe nodule, for which three to six month followup CT is recommended to exclude a small focus of neoplasm.
[**11-11**] ccath: COMMENTS: 1) Resting hemodynamics on the ventilator revealed severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures with severe pulmonary hypertension and borderline low cardiac output on pressor support (neosynephrine) while tachycardic.
2) Pulmonary angiogram revealed no evidence of R or L main pulmonary embolism with normal blush to the right lung parenchyma and a known compressed left lung (large left pleural effusion).
3) Coronary angiography revealed a normal left main, an occluded  proximal LAD with a widely patent LIMA to the mid LAD and mild distal LAD disease, a 90% proximal dominant CX lesion with OM1 occluded and OM1 filled via a widely patent vein graft, and the nondominant RCA with a 90% calcified proximal lesion.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
An echo showed RV failure and the patient was taken to the cath lab for presumed PE.
A pulmonary angiogram was negative for PE.
CTA was negative for PE.
His creatinine and potassium were monitored closely given aggressive diuresis, and were stable during his hospital course.
On admission, oxygen requirement was 4L (he was satting mid 90s), and was weaned down to 2L with diuresis.
Prior to discharge, the chest tubes were pulled as the patient was no longer dyspneic and sating well.
CAD s/p CABG:  EKG on admission did not show any changes and biomarkers remained stable.
Pump: Hemodynamics during ccath showed CWP 25, RA 27, PA 83/42/61, suggesting BiV failure.
His PA HTN appeared to be longstanding as evidenced on prior echos and was likely related to chronic lung compromise secondary to hemothorax and fibrothorax.
An echo done post cath showed an EF 45-50%.
Post OR hypotension: Although it was initially thought that the patient had a large PE while in the OR for evacuation of his L hemothorax, pulmonary angiography found no evidence for this.
He was rate controlled, with HR in 70s-80s, with diltiazem titration as blood pressure tolerated.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy:  The patient was found to have pathologically enlarged lymph nodes and a BM biopsy concerning for MDS.
It was therefore attributed to blood loss.
He reportedly had a BM biopsy as an out-patient, bm bx results from OSH concerning for MDS.
He also had been on prednisone for his TCP with little effect.
His hct and platelets were monitored closely and repleted as needed.
Three days prior to discharge, pt's hematocrit showed a slow downward trend, which over the next two days prompted administration of 2uPRBCs.
Patient recommended to have a repeat hematocrit check 3 days after discharge to assess need for additional transfusions.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Please check pt's hematocrit within 3-5 days to ensure stabilization, given his need for transfusions as an inpt and guaic (+) stools.
Please check pt's hct, pt, inr within 3-5 days of discharge.
Please also have a hematocrit checked 3 days following discharge from the hospital.
Please check a hematocrit in 3 days to assess if hematocrit has stabilized.
