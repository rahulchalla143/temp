In the ED her VS were T 97.4  BP 113/69  HR 97  RR 18  O2 100% on 2L.
She had back pain (chronic) and was given 4mg IV morphine and SBP dropped to high 80s.
At that time, she had pain in her right upper quadrant and underwent an ultrasound to evaluate for potential gallstones.
The ultrasound showed a mass.
She went on to have a CT scan, which also showed a very suspicious looking mass concerning for HCC.
She had an AFP of 112,000.
- She continued on RAD001 for some time; however, developed a rising AFP and worsening disease on CT scan on [**2132-12-5**] and was taken off of the study.
She had a CT scan [**2133-2-3**] which showed progressive disease so she was taken off of the trial.

Microbiology [**3-25**] Blood Cultures Negative [**3-26**] Ascites Fluid Negative .
Imaging [**2133-3-25**] LLE U/S  No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
Bilateral right greater than left pleural effusions, essentially unchanged in cross-modality comparison to the CT from [**2133-2-3**].
Gadolinium enhanced study recoomeded .
No intravenous contrast given, precluding evaluation for leptomeningeal metastatic disease.
[**2133-3-30**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2133-3-30**] CXR 1.
# ARF - Ms. [**Known lastname 7053**] presented with an acute elevation in Cr (1.5 on arrival, ~1.0 at baseline).
Given history of decreased PO intake and physical exam, thought to be consistent with hypovolemia and prerenal failure.
She was given IVF + albumin challenge to attempt to improve renal function, as well as rule-out/treat HRS.
On the floor, she was given another challenge of albumin and her creatinine normalized.
On the floor, initial exam showed marked weakness.
Neurology was consulted and an MRI of the spine was attempted, which was complicated by the patient`s inability to lay flat.
# Hyponatremia - Ms. [**Known lastname 7053**] has chronic hyponatremia in low 130s and presented with a sodium of 128.
# Cirrhosis - Liver enzymes at baseline on admission.
Ascites labs were consistent with a portal hypertensive etiology.
Of note, triglycerides were elevated in the ascitic fluid, consistent with chylous ascites; this is strongly associated with malignancy, consistent with patient's h/o HCC.
# Goals of Care: Palliative Care, chaplains, and the primary team had extensive conversations with Ms. [**Known lastname 7053**] and her family regarding her goals of care.
Cirrhosis 5.
