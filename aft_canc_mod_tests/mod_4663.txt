Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent dissection, and normal flow .
CT HEAD [**2140-6-14**]: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
No evidence to suggest acute infarction, however suspicion remains high, an MRI would be more sensitive to assess for this.
MRI HEAD [**2140-6-15**]: 1) No evidence of acute infarction.
CAROTID U/S [**2140-6-15**]: Moderate plaque with a right 40-59% carotid stenosis.
He was monitored on telemetry and his troponins never exceeded 0.01.
Patient will follow up with his PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name Initial (PRE) 19697**] of his BP soon after discharge given the changes that were made in his BP regimen.
Work up included carotid U/S dopplers which did not show significant stenosis, and CT and MRI of the brain which did not show any signs of acute infarction.
Blood pressures were kept between 130-160.
3) Upper GI Bleed: Patient arrived to the CCU after vomiting 300+cc of blood which was thought to be due to his known ampullary mass.
An NG tube was placed, 2 large bore PIVs were secured, and he was monitored with serial hcts.
Hematemasis resolved and patient was taken for EGD which showed no further bleeding, but friable tissue over the ampullary mass.
His hct remained stable throught rest of hospitalization.
Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 6 weeks for repeat EGD and resection of mass (must be off Plavix for 2 weeks prior to procedure.)
4) FEN: Patient's electrolytes were stable throughout admission, his diet was advanced without difficulty.
