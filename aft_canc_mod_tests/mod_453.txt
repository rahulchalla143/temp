Per report, on a recent CT scan, the patient had diffusion abnormalities in the right occipital region and also in the right medullary region of his brain.
The patient had a factor 5 lidin, protein CNS and prothrombin gene mutation workup which were all negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs included a temperature of 96.1, a blood pressure of 178/60, a heart rate of 76, respirations of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 98% on 4 liters and 94% in room air.
Pulmonary:  Distant breath sounds but clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Temperature sensation was decreased on the left side.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  The patient's white count was 7.4, hemoglobin 17.0 and hematocrit 48.9 with platelets of 212.
Coagulation studies showed a PT of 13.1, a PTT of 24.9 and an INR of 1.1.
Electrolytes included a sodium of 137, a potassium of 4.4, a chloride of 102 and a bicarbonate of 25.
BUN was 17 and creatinine was 1.2.
Glucose was 86.
Urinalysis showed a large amount of blood, positive nitrites, small leukocyte esterase, 21-50 white blood cells, many bacteria, no yeast and less than 1 epithelial cell.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute with occasional PVCs.
This was unchanged from a previous EKG, and the patient was ruled out x3 for a myocardial infarction.
The patient's chest x-ray was generally negative except for a tortuous and dilated aorta.
A CT angiogram showed non-occlusive pulmonary embolism in the right upper lobe, aneurysmal dilatation at the origin of the left subclavian artery, dilatation of the ectatic portion of the aorta at the diaphragmatic hiatus and emphysema.
Given his recent stroke, the patient also had a CT of the head performed which showed probable diffuse ectasia and multiple areas of atherosclerotic calcification within the tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**], probable polypoid area of mucosal thickening partially obscuring the left sphenoid air cells, to a lesser degree within both ethmoid sinuses and to a minimal degree within the right maxillary sinus.
The patient also had a MRI of his spine given his bilateral lower extremity complaints.
MRI of the cervical spine showed changes of cervical spondylosis with a large right-sided disc osteophyte complex at the C3-C4 level with severe narrowing of the right neural foramen.
MRI of the thoracic spine showed degenerative changes with no evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities in the thoracic region.
MRI of the lumbar spine showed multilevel degenerative changes in the lumbar region without spinal stenosis.
Aneurysm of the upper abdominal aorta was demonstrated by previous CT and correlation with that exam was recommended.
He also had an extensive workup done to evaluate his neurologic complaints, and it was thought that the patient's fluctuating and vague neurologic symptoms were probably secondary to decreased perfusion secondary to his orthostatic hypotension.
The patient also had a CT scan of the abdomen performed given his neurologic complaints in the bilateral lower extremities.
The lower extremity arterial duplex scan showed significant right iliac occlusive disease.
However, once the patient's blood pressure stabilized, the patient was begun on a low dose of Lopressor (12.5 mg p.o.
Hematology:  The patient was found to have an erythrocytosis with a hematocrit which fluctuated between 45 and 50.
The patient had a repeat urinalysis sent later on to evaluate lytes, and this urinalysis showed no signs of infection.
The patient's Flomax was discontinued during his stay secondary to concerns over his blood pressure and may be restarted prior to his discharge if the patient continues to complain of urinary retention.
Finally, the patient was seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy once his blood pressure became more stable with good effect.
