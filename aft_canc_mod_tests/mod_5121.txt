She also had a head CT with brain mets and vasogenic edema (although improved) as below so decadron dosng was increased to [**Hospital1 **].
Biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated tumor, ER/PR/Her2neu all negative, underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and subsequently bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction in [**7-29**], and subsequently with radiation post operatively.
MRI completed in [**1-30**] showed increased size of her brain mets.

CARDIOLOGY: TTE ([**5-24**]): Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-4-22**], no change.
If indicated, a cardiac MRI or CT may be better to assess for pericardial constriction/pericardial thickness.
[**Year (4 digits) 706**]: CXR [**5-22**]: FINDINGS: Comparison is made to [**2186-5-17**], and multiple priors.
Lung volumes remain very low, but allowing for this, cardiomediastinal contours appear unchanged.
Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions are not significantly changed, right greater than left.
Known pleural and parenchymal metastases are not well visualized by radiographs, better demonstrated on recent CT of [**2186-4-19**].
CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
CRX [**6-9**] Mild pulmonary edema has worsened, left lower lobe is chronically collapsed, no appreciable right pleural effusion, pigtail pleural drain still in place, small left pleural effusion stable, heart size is normal.
CT chest on admission showed increase pleural effusions with large loculated right effusion.
TTE was obtained which showed EF of 55-60% and no change since prior [**2186-4-22**].
She was diagnosed with a HAP MSSA PNA and was treated with a course of vanco and Zosyn initially and then continued on Zosyn.
Despite medical advise of a head CT to evaluate the patient, her husband refused this procedure.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 153**] stay there had been concern over the husband?????
Given that the patient had intracranial tumor, the differential including bleeding into that area, edema, expansion, early herniation - to determine this, we attempted to perform a head CT scan but the husband refused for the reason that he felt it would not change her management.
SBP up to 200s briefly, then in 100s, and tachy to 140s.
Pulse was still present.
Neuro exam showed mildly dilated and fixed pupils.
