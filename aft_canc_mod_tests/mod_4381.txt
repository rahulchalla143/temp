The pt reported that at 7pm on [**4-29**] he had sudden onset hemoptysis - bright red blood with some clots which he estimated at 2 tbsp.
In the ED, initial VS were: T98.4, HR 112, 141/96, R21, 94% on RA.
Nasogastric lavage showed scant red blood thought likely due to swallowing coughed up blood.
CTA showed RUL spiculated mass.
Blood pressures on the floor were notably elevated in the 180's systolic and the patient's O2 sats remained normal on room air.
Bronchoscopy showed a large clot in the right bronchus intermedius, but no active bleeding was visualized.
Blood pressures had begun to drift down in the OR, and peripheral neosynephrine was at 1mcg/hr.

Portable CXR [**2126-4-29**]: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is upper limits of normal, with a possible left ventricular configuration, which can be seen with hypertension.
Bronchial brushings [**2126-4-30**]: (From RUL) NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
ECG [**2126-4-30**]: TRACING #2 Sinus rhythm.
CTA chest [**2126-4-30**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2126-4-30**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Right bronchial arteriogram demonstrating origin of the right bronchial artery from a right intercostal artery.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2126-5-2**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hematoma in the abdomen or pelvis; bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
CXR [**2126-5-3**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-2**], the left PICC line has been extended so that the tip lies in the mid portion of the SVC.
CT HEAD W/WOUT CONTRAST [**2126-5-8**] - FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial, bony, or soft tissue masses.
However, MRI is more sensitive in detection of intracranial metastases.
# Hemoptysis: The patient was transferred to the trauma SICU post bronchoscopy with placement of double lumen ETT tube.
He underwent pulmonary angiogram with coil embolization of the right bronchial artery without further epidodes of significant hemoptysis.
Post-procedure his hematocrit dropped to thirty and a CT abdomen/pelvis was performed to evaluate for retroperitoneal bleed, which was negative.
Repeat hematocrit check was at baseline.
His hematocrit remained stable throught the remainder of his hospital course with no further evidence of hemoptysis.
Bronchial washings were obtained during the initial bronchscopy with intiail pathology demonstrating reactive bronchial cells.
All microbiologic studies were negative.
The patient was taken for repeat bronchoscopy for planned EBUS on [**5-7**].
The patient was taken for CT guided biopsy of the RUL lesion on [**5-8**] with pathology results pending at the time of discharge.
He underwent CT Head for staging as MRI was unable to be obtained secondary to hardware, which was negative for evidence of metastasis.
CT A/P also negative.
He is scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Thoracic Surgery for further evaluation and management of suspected lung cancer.
