[**2164-12-22**] CT Head: No evidence for hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute ischemic changes.
Bilateral air fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses may be secondary to intubation, however, could also represent acute sinusitis .
Probable aspiration left upper lung lobe vs consolidation; 2. mildly dilated fluid filled loops of small and large bowel throughout abd/pelvis; 3. peri-portal vein edema which can be a CT sign of liver disease;  4.
Further evaluation with imaging and clinical correlation would be suggested.
[**12-24**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-21**] through 26: Mild vascular congestion and small regions of peribronchial opacification have developed at the lung bases since [**12-23**] and may represent volume overload and early pneumonia, respectively.
[**12-31**] CT head FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or acute territorial infarction.
[**12-31**] CXR The heart is normal in size.
The exam was otherwise unremarkable.
EEG showed central irritable focus (thus ?
predisposed to seizure) and MRI/MRA head normal.
