She was empirically started on dexamethasone 4mg [**Hospital1 **] and had a stat MRI last evening which demonstrated a 14mm mass in the right frontal lobe with extensive edema and midline shift, along with a 4mm mass in the left occipital lobe and a 2mm mass in the superior right frontal lobe.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Her oncologic history began in [**2179-1-27**] when a right kidney mass was suspected on angiography (status post superficial femoral angioplasty and stenting).
In [**2179-6-29**], she underwent abdominal/pelvic CT which revealed a right kidney mass.
Chest CT in [**2179-7-30**] revealed 2 small pulmonary nodules suspicious for metastatic disease.
She was planned for high-dose IL-2 therapy with stress echo showing anterior ischemia.
She underwent cardiac catheterization with a 90-95% stenosis of the proximal LAD noted.
She recovered well without cardiac issues and passed follow- up stress test to meet eligibility for the high-dose IL-2 select trial.
She had a CT scan done of the torso on [**2181-8-27**] and this showed interval slight increase in the size of her multiple pulmonary nodules.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Diabetes - Hyperlipidemia - Hypertension - Peripheral vascular disease, s/p R superficial femoral artery stenting x 2 - CAD, cardiac catheterization revealing a 95-99% proximal stenosis of the LAD; s/p PCI stenting in [**2181-3-29**]   Social History: She continues to live in [**Hospital1 392**] and will occasionally help out at her relatives' Chinese restaurant answering phones.

CXR ([**12-5**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of osseous metastasis.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] ([**12-7**]): IMPRESSION: Limited pre-op WAND study, for resection, demonstrating the dominant 15-mm right frontovertex enhancing lesion with large zone of associated vasogenic edema, additional punctiform enhancing lesion in the right frontal corona radiata, at the dorsal margin of the edematous zone, and 5.5-mm enhancing lesion with adjacent vasogenic edema in the left occipital pole.
CT Head ([**12-8**]): IMPRESSION: Expected postsurgical changes status post right frontal craniotomy and lesion resection.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] ([**12-9**]): Pending  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 63year old woman with a history of renal cell carcinoma with known metastasis to the occipital lobe/T6 vertebrae and lungs, CAD s/p DES to proximal LAD on [**4-5**], DM, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with left arm pain and outpatient MRI head on [**12-3**] showing a 14 mm enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe with extensive surrounding edema and mild shift of midline structures, 4-mm left occipital lobe enhancing lesion with surrounding edema, and 2 mm right superior frontal lobe enhancing lesion.
Her Dexamethasone had been increased at home from 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 6 mg tid.
Pre-op MRI WAND study was limited, but showed the dominant 15-mm right frontovertex enhancing lesion with large zone of associated vasogenic edema, additional punctiform enhancing lesion in the right frontal corona radiata, at the dorsal margin of the edematous zone, and 5.5-mm enhancing lesion with adjacent vasogenic edema in the left occipital pole.
She underwent a MRI and CT scan demonstrated a T6 metastasis with involvement of the [**5-5**] foramen.
She underwent a T6 vertebrectomy, Anterior arthrodesis T5-T6 & T6-T7 and posterior fusion of T2-T10.
Her creatinine on dc was 0.7, she was treated with Levaquin for a UTI.
