She was evaluated in the ER at [**Hospital **] Hospital where she underwent an extensive workup revealing no problems.
INR was 1.1.
She then underwent a V/Q scan which was negative and was started on Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] per her oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
CNII-XII intact  Pertinent Results: [**2133-6-29**] 11:50AM URINE RBC->50 WBC->50 Bacteri-OCC Yeast-FEW Epi-0-2 TransE-0-2 [**2133-6-26**] 04:18AM BLOOD WBC-15.7*# RBC-2.75* Hgb-8.1* Hct-24.0* MCV-87 MCH-29.6 MCHC-33.9 RDW-14.4 Plt Ct-422  Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 1154**] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the surgery service on [**2133-4-15**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].
Admission labs showed WBC 10.7; INR 1.2; BUN 34; Creat 1.7; Alb 3.5; TRF 160.
A new draining site was noted on exam in proximity to her old midline fistula site.
Admission weight showed that she had lost 10 pounds since last admission.
BUN 14; Creat 1.2; INR 1.6; WBC 5.8.
At HD 7 a fistulagram was completed which showed no clear relationship between the abscess and the bowel.
At HD 10 she was taken to CT for attempted drainage of the abdominal abscess.
KUB showed evidence of small bowel obstruction.
At HD 16 abx coverage was adjusted for wound culture (+) yeast/enterococcus/MRSA.
CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis was performed which showed a high-grade obstruction of the proximal jejunum with transition point in the mid abdomen.
Ostomy output waxed and waned.
On [**6-9**] she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions (4 hours enterectomy enteroenterostomy), resection of desmoid times 1, of the abdominal wall with enterectomy, closure of enterotomy and enteroenterostomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].
Cells positive for CK 20 and CDX2, negative for CK 7 -> suggestive of an intestinal primary site.
Urine analysis showed yeast in the urine for which she was placed on diflucan.
Cultures eventually showed 10,000-100,000 yeast/ml.
She also had a CT scan to rule out any abdominal source for the fever.
The CT scan showed some old contrast from the upper gi, but no evidence of a current leak.
Fever >101 2.
Please follow up with you regular oncologist for INR monitoring and evaluation as discussed.
