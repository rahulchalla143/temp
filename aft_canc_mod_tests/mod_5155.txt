The patient also had a paracentesis with negative cytology at the OSH.
CT torso on [**10-20**] showed bilateral pulmonary opacities, diffuse lymphadenopathy, ascities, and ovarian masses.
Ultrasound on [**2107-10-21**] showed bilateral pelvic soft tissue masses with ascites and normal uterus.
Right pelvic lymph node was sent for frozen section which was found to be consistent with lymphoma.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was intubated and mildly sedated, VS: BP 84/52 MAP 65 HR 88 O2 sat 95% on AC.
Her abdominal wound was draining up to 1L/day.
Also while in the ICU, she was noted to have an EF of 20%,; it is unclear if this is from an MI in the setting of hypotension or if it is just "shocked" myocardium.
After her acute issues stabilized, the patient was transferred to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] for further management.
pedal pulses present neuro: not responsive to voice or noxious stimuli [**3-3**] sedation.

CT scan [**2107-11-4**] for lymphoma staging: There is mildly heterogeneous and enlarged thyroid gland with a small 1-cm hypodense nodule within the right lobe.
A representative node within the left axilla is seen on series 2, image 8, measuring 16 x 12 mm.
A representative size of this conglomeration is seen on series 2, image 74 measuring 86 x 52 mm.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is catheterized.
Echo ([**2107-11-2**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Repeat echo prior to R-CHOP ([**12-5**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and  cavity size are normal.
Abdominal Ultrasound ([**11-24**]): There are again identified bilateral pleural effusions, partially imaged.
A shadowing gallstone is demonstrated within the gallbladder lumen.
Color flow and Doppler evaluation of the hepatic vasculature was performed given history of ascites.
CTA ([**12-2**]):  1.
Although definite co-expression of CD5 amongst B-cells could not be discerned, a subset of weak CD5 expressing cells is seen amongst the brighter CD5 positive T-cells.
Scattered CD10 positive lymphocytes are seen.
A subset express CD20.
INTERPRETATION Findings are of involvement by a Lambda restricted, CD5-positive B cell lymphoproliferative disorder, immunophenotypically consistent with patient's known mantle cell lymphoma.
Given the small percentage of involved B-cells, peripheral blood contamination cannot be ruled out.
Her counts dropped in response to chemotherapy and she was neutropenic for several days.
The patient was transfused to keep her hematocrit above 25 and platelets above 10. .
Her ascites fluid was drained in the operating room, and not sent for studies.
The patient had reaccumulation of both fluid collections, which were unintervenable while she was neutropenic.
Once her counts recovered, the patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis of 3 liters, which demonstrated malignant cells.
She underwent CTA which demostrated a very large right pleural effusion with right lung collapse.
Her ovarian pathology was cystadenofibroma.
Repeat TTE, when her critical illness resolved revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, but persistent right sided failure.
Prior to beginning treatment with R-CHOP, the patient again had an echocardiogram which demonstrated resolution of the right heart failure and 2+ MR. .
Repeat urine culture was negative.
Chronic back pain: MRI demonstrated no spinal or vertebral involvement of her lymphoma.
MRI revealed no spinal involvement of her lymphoma .
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
