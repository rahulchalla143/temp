The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service on the day of admission for evaluation of syncope versus seizure, but subsequently had a cardiac arrest in the Emergency Department.
Subsequent cardiac monitoring demonstrated ventricular fibrillation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 93, blood pressure 93/60, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% on the aforementioned mechanical ventilatory settings.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.
Neurologic:  She had fixed pupils, as noted above, no response to painful stimuli, 1+ biceps and brachioradialis reflexes bilaterally, and no patellar or ankle reflexes.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The patient's white blood cell count was 7.2, hematocrit 35.8, platelet count 50,000.
Initial PT 14.5, PTT 30.3, INR 1.4.
Her fibrinogen level was 221.
Serum sodium initially was 140, potassium 4.2, chloride 106, bicarbonate 19, BUN 17, creatinine 1.3, glucose 136, calcium 8.2, magnesium 1.8, phosphate 3.2.
Her initial urinalysis demonstrated positive nitrate, large blood, greater than 300 protein, moderate leukocyte esterase, 0-2 red blood cells, 0-2 white blood cells, moderate bacteria, no yeast, and no epithelial cells.
Her LFTs prior to her cardiac arrest were unremarkable.
Her initial ABG demonstrated pH of 7.23, PC02 28, P02 329 on pressure support of 5, PEEP 5, and FI02 of 60%.
Initial chest x-ray done before her arrest demonstrated no evidence of CHF, pneumonia, lymphadenopathy, or intrathoracic metastases.
Subsequent chest radiographs obtained after the patient's arrest demonstrated interval placement of an endotracheal tube but otherwise confirmed the above findings.
An EKG done after the patient's arrest demonstrated sinus rhythm, ventricular bigeminy with two ventricular foci, poor R wave progression in leads V1 through V4 consistent with an old anteroseptal myocardial infarction, and otherwise no new findings.
This ventricular bigeminy was no longer present on repeat EKG done on the day of admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  A repeat head CT scan done in route to the CCU from the Emergency Department demonstrated no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or stroke.
An echocardiogram done on the day of admission demonstrated an elongated left atrium, normal left ventricular cavity size, severely depressed overall left ventricular systolic function with global hypokinesis and septal hypokinesis, a dilated right ventricle, and a very small pericardial effusion.
A chest MRI was done two days later that again demonstrated a mass within the right ventricle that appeared to be adherent to the septal wall.
Of note, she had an MRI of the head done two days after admission that demonstrated likely cortical infarctions involving the temporal and posterior parietal lobes as well as lacunar infarctions in the cerebellum.
By [**2177-3-8**], the patient's neurologic function remained very poor and was essentially unchanged; she had minimally reactive pupils bilaterally, scant response to painful stimuli, and no response to the Babinski test with evidence of new stroke as noted in the above MRI report.
