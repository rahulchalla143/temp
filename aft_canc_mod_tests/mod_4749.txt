She was subsequently brought to the ER at NWH where head CT showed a right frontal brain lesion and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals: T 98.4; BP 121/71 ; P 114; RR 20; O2 sat 100%  General: lying in bed NAD HEENT: NCAT, dry mucous membranes Neck: supple Pulmonary: decrease lung sounds on L. Cardiac: tachycardic, with no m/r/g Abdomen: soft, nontender, non distended, normal bowel sounds Extremities: no c/c/e.
Registers [**2-28**], recalls [**12-31**] at 5 min.
Pertinent Results: CT Head [**2176-1-10**]: stable hemorrhagic mass in the right frontal convexity with stable surrounding edema.
Echo [**2176-1-11**]: Moderate mitral regurgitation with borderline LV systolic function.
MRI Brain [**2176-1-11**]: 3.1 cm enhancing hemorrhagic mass located in the right posterior frontal lobe with surrounding edema but no midline shift.
CT Head [**2176-1-13**]: Expected post-surgical changes following a right frontoparietal craniotomy, with blood products in the resection cavity and pneumocephalus overlying bilateral frontal lobes.
MRI Head [**2176-1-13**]: Small area of restricted diffusion identified adjacent to the surgical bed, measuring 9 x 7 mm in size, possibly representing a small ischemic area.
With gadolinium contrast, there is a nodular area of enhancement at the medial aspect of the surgical cavity, measuring approximately 6 x 10.3 mm in size in the transverse dimension x 5.3 x 12.8 in coronal projection, possibly consistent with a small residual lesion, followup is recommended.
