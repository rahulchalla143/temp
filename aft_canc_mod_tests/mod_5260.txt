Neuroimaging revealed brain lesion, and she underwent brain biopsy on [**2144-6-8**].
A non-contrast head CT showed left frontal mass.
MRI of the brain showed three ring enhancing lesions in the left frontal lobe without edema or midline shift.
A lumbar puncture was negative for infection.
TTE demonstrated an EF of 60% and trace TR and PI.
Further inquiry revealed that she had a seizure on [**2144-8-3**] as well.
She had further events and was transferred to the ICU.

A CT head showed no intracranial hemorrhage; MRI showed small interval change in the size of her L frontoparietal mass which could be attributed either to tumor growth or post-XRT changes.
LP showed clear CSF w/protein 47 glucose 64 WBC 2 RBC 12.
After the seizure an EKG showed sinus tachycardia to 95-110. .
Continuous EEG revealed >25 subclinical seizures, so keppra was increased to 1.5 g [**Hospital1 **] in consultation w/neuro-onc.
During her stay here, it was noted that her examination changed further such that she became generally more lethargic and developed worsening right leg weakness.
A repeat MRI showed worsening of edema versus radiation necrosis changes with increased midline shift.
Her dose of dexamethasone was increased and her examination soon reverted back to baseline.

Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 69633**] was transferred to the epilepsy monitoring unit of the [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment of subclinical seizures.
A repeat MRI of her brain showed worsening swelling around the region of her tumor, and subsequently her dose of dexamethasone (steroid) was increased.
