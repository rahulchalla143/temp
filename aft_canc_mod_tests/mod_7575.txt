MICRO: BCx negative x4 UCx negative x2 C.DIFF NEGATIVE .
IMAGING: [**11-12**] CT HEAD  TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were acquired of the head without contrast and reformatted into coronal and sagittal planes.
FINDINGS: The exam is somewhat limited by patient motion, although repeat scans were performed.
An air-fluid level is seen in the sphenoid sinus with aerosolized debris.
Air-fluid levels in multiple paranasal sinuses.
Images of the injection site were also acquired.
INTERPRETATION: Serial images over the abdomen show poor uptake of tracer into the hepatic parenchyma in a homogeneous pattern.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-13**]: Consolidation in the perihilar left lung and in the right upper lung extending to the apex is readily explained by massive aspiration.
CXR [**2103-11-18**] Bilateral upper lobe consolidation is slightly more pronounced today than yesterday.
Sigmoidoscopy [**2103-11-23**] - Polyp at 8cm in the rectum - Polyps at the ranging distance from 18 cm to 28 cm in the distal sigmoid colon - Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids - Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure - Recommendations: Patient will need colonoscopy for removal of polyps when her alcoholic hepatitis improves and her INR is less than 1.5.
# Alcoholic Hepatitis: Hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, LFTs with alcoholic picture, viral studies were negative.
Steroids were deferred initially for possible acute hepatitis since her LFTs and bilirubin were improving in the MICU with fluids.
A lumbar puncture was attempted, but unsuccessful.
The patient then had a right upper quadrant ultrasound that showed dilated common bile duct, so she underwent a HIDA scan which ruled out cholangitis as a cause of her AMS and leukocytosis.
# Acute Renal Failure: The patient was found to be in ARF (baseline creatinine is around 0.9) and presented with creat 5.2.
FeNa of 0.22 consistent with prerenal etiology and muddy brown casts were found in the urine sediment suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
She underwent a renal ultrasound which was normal and an albumin challenge which ruled out hepatorenal syndrome.
Creatinine continued to improve after albumin was given and with improvement in hepatitis.
Cultures negative otherwise in work up.
# Upper GI bleed (UGIB): Presented with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), and a Hematocrit trending down 33 -> 30.
Her hematocrit remained stable and she did not recieve any blood transfusions.
Patient again felt this was menses though rectal exam with internal hemorrhoids.
Repeat colonoscopy deferred to outpatient after improvement in hepatitis and coagulopathy.
# Anion Gap Acidosis: She is noted to have a gap of 18 upon admission labs.
Her lactate was within normal limits, no osmolar gap.
After hepatitis and HCAP improved/resolved her Na remained stable requiring no further intervention.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Colonoscopy needs to be completed as an outpatient with removal of colonic polyps after INR improves - Patient counseled extensively on the importance of alcohol abstainence and she is agreeable with plan.
Flex Sigmoidoscopy performed showed polyps in your sigmoid colon which should be followed up after you are discharged.
You were treated with lactulose to make you have bowel movements which will remove these toxic substances.
The following changes were made to your medications: - START Folic Acid 1mg Daily - START Thiamine 100 mg DAILY - START Vitamin D 400 UNIT DAILY - START Hydrocortisone cream: apply rectally as needed for irritation - CONTINUE Pantoprazole - START Lactulose 30 mL Twice daily - START Rifaximin 550 mg twice daily .
It is also very important that you have a colonoscopy to evaluate polyps in your colon.
