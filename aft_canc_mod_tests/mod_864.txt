During a recent ER evaluation, she underwent a chest CT scan that was notable for a very large aneurysm and dilatation of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.
CT was also significant for a large amount of mural thrombus in the descending thoracic aorta.
The CT scan was also significant for coronary artery calcifications and left adrenal adenoma.
During her visit, she was very hypertensive with blood pressures in the 160's mmHg systolic over 100's mmHg diastolic.
Given the dimensions of her aneurysm and uncontrolled hypertension, it was decided to admit her for blood pressure management along with further preoperative evaluation and urgent surgical intervention.
BP 130/84 bilat abdomen- benign extremeties- warm, good pulses, no edema wounds- clean and dry.
Pertinent Results: [**2143-10-21**] Chest CTA: CT ANGIOGRAM: Not significant change in the previously described massive aneurysmal dilatation of the entire ascending and descending thoracic aorta, including the arch.
3D measurements are as follows: aortic root: 34 x 30 mm, ascending aorta: 51 x 47 mm, aortic arch: 61 x 48 mm descending aorta (maximum): 85 x 72 mm, lower descending aorta: 37 x 34 mm CT CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: A 8 x 5 mm hypodense nodule is seen in the right thyroid lobe.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

Cardiac catheterization was done to reveal significant disease .
Atenolol was switched to Labetolol while she intermittently required IV Hydralazine to maintain systolic blood pressures in the 120mmHg range.
Her preoperative workup was notable for a positive urinalysis for which she was empirically started on Ciprofloxacin.
Her BP was controlled with high dose beta blockade and ACE inhibitors.
She was diuresed to preop weight and mobilized.
A speech and swallowing evaluation was done due to continued complaints of odynophagia and dysphagia to liquids.
Should her problems persist for more than a couple more weeks, ENT evaluation will be undertaken.
