Of note, she had a recent admission at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2180-11-15**] - [**2180-11-16**] for pleuritic chest pain and a fever to 102.
However, she was having ongoing fevers to 101.4 so plan was to repeat CT torso this week for eval of lymphoma.
CXR with new bilateral effusions.
Pulsus was 12-14 per fellow.

Echo [**2180-12-3**] on admission: LVEF>55%.
CXR AP/Lateral [**2180-12-3**]: Interval development of bilateral effusions, with associated left basilar opacity, possibly representing effusion and atelectasis, though associated airspace consolidation is difficult to exclude radiographically.
Echo [**2180-12-4**]: LVEF>55.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-12-3**], the effusion is slightly larger with impaired right ventricular filling and smaller cavity.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevation of right and left heart filling pressures with equalization of diastolic pressures consistent with tamponade physiology.
Post Cardiac Catherization Echo [**2180-12-4**]: LVEF>55%.
With injection of agitated saline, contrast is seen in the pericardial space.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR [**2180-12-5**]: Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left with associated atelectasis, and small on the right.
CXR AP/Lateral [**2180-12-6**]: Large pleural effusions are again seen bilaterally, more prominent on the left, where there is substantial decrease in volume of the lower lobe.
Pericardial Effusion with tamponade physiology by Echocardiogram: The patient presented with a pericardial effusion and was found to have constrictive and tamponade physiology by echocardiogram on Day 2 of hospital stay.
The patient was taken to cardiac catherization and 140 cc of pericardial fluid was drained and a pericardial drain was left in place.
A repeat echocardiogram showed minimal pericardial effusion and no longer demonstrated tamponade physiology.
A repeat echocardiogram continued to show minimal pericardial effusion and no longer demonstrated tamponade physiology.
The fluid was sent for cytology, flow cytometry and culture.
CT of torso scheduled as an outpatient [**2180-12-8**].
Hematology/Oncology has requested only a CT of abdomen and pelvis to evaluate for lymphadenopathy.
The fluid drained from the heart was not infected, and did not contain any malignant cells.
You will need an outpatient CT scan of your abdomen and plevis to look for lymphadenopathy.
