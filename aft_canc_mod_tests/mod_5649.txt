She was first diagnosed with her disease in the summer of [**2102**] where she had a mammogram showing suspicious microcalcifications in her left breast.
At 6 month follow up, the mammogram showed worsening of the calcifications, and she underwent a stereotactic biopsy.
Pathology was consistent with invasive ductal cancer, poorly differentiated, with DCIS, ER/PR negative.
In [**1-10**], she had a CT that showed at least 6 brain mets, and she had a short course of XRT at that time (5 days of Rx).
Recent CT of the chest showed probable liver mets with a stable appearance of her left lung  (post-xrt changes).
CT of the brain on [**2105-2-20**] showed multiple enhancing masses, the most prominent in the left cerebellar region.
She was initially evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on [**3-6**] who thought the edema could be due to Herceptin (uncommon side effect) vs. CHF.
Her LDH was elevated as well.
Chest X-ray was unchanged from prior (no pna, no effusion, edema, or infiltrate), and bilateral LE US were negative for DVT.
TTE [**2-10**] showing EF=60-70%, mildly dilated LA, LV WNL, trivial MR 5.

TTE in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] revealed new MR and right sided failure.
TTE was rechecked prior to discharge and found to be back to her baseline with improvement in biventricular function and no valvular abnormalities.
This lasix will need to be tapered as her edema resolves, and her Potassium will need to be monitored given this lasix therapy.
Repeat TTE prior to discharge showed resolution of the MR and new right-sided failure.
Staging bone scan was obtained in-house showing increased uptake at multiple levels in the T-spine, but no other areas of probable metastatic disease.
HTN: Atenolol and HCTZ were initially held while in-house due to her hypotension and sepsis but were started prior to discharge with good blood pressure control.
