Positive for abdominal distension, leg edema, chills, fatigue, and anorexia.
Past Medical History: - chronic hepatitis B infection (precore mutation positive, HBeAb positive, HBeAg negative) with cirrhosis with known grade II varices on EGD in [**11/2188**] - chronic thrombocytopenia, presumably from cirrhosis - recent hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis with "innumerable nodules" on liver MRI with elevated alpha-fetoprotein - positive PPD   Social History: Smoked less than one pack of cigarettes per day.

Hepatitis B viral load PCR ([**2190-4-7**]): 23,400 IU/mL Alpha-fetoprotein ([**2190-4-7**]): 760.7 EBV serologies ([**2190-4-7**]): negative IgG and IgM CMV serologies ([**2190-4-7**]): positive IgG, negative IgM .
Studies: CXR AP ([**2190-4-20**]): There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which appears new when compared to the prior study.
CXR [**4-21**]: interval development of edema .
MRI Abdomen ([**2190-4-7**]): There is decrease in signal intensity of the liver diffusely on the in-phase images, compatible with presence of siderotic nodules.
The liver appears to have innumerable nodules throughout, which appear bigger and more discrete compared to the previous study and also show new wash-out and increased heterogeneity in the later phases post-contrast compared with the previous study.
This lesion was present on the previous study, but currently has a more round shape.
The adrenals, spleen, and visualized pancreas appear unremarkable, as is the gallbladder.
Brief Hospital Course: Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, T 97.8, BP 99/64, HR 100, RR 18, Sat 95% on room air.
His labs were notable for a Hct of 29.9 (down from 44.7 on [**2190-4-8**]), a WBC of 18.7 with 73% PMNs, 3% myelos, and 1% promyelos (no bands), and an INR of 3.2 (up from 2.7 on [**2190-4-8**]).
He was given two units of FFP and a diagnostic paracentesis was performed to rule out SBP; prior to the ascitic fluid cell count results returning, he received 1000 mg of IV vancomycin (he was also written for 4.5 grams of piperacillin/tazobactam but did not receive this).
First night in the hospital, he became dyspneic after IVF fluids and albumin; a chest xray: mod fluid overload.
Serial Hct trending down to 22 and then, the following morning, he had a maroon, jelly-consistency stool.
BP drifted down to SBP 80s-90s, with mild tachycardia 80s-> 105.
In the MICU, EGD showed blood in stomach, stigmata of variceal bleeding, one varices banded, duodenal ulcers one of which looked ulcerated and suspicious for malignancy.
CXR c/w bowel gas, NGT to suction.
