Septic Shock, bactremia, Septicemia (Gram +), severe Leukocytosis, Bacterial UTI: Although no obvious source was identified for such an inflammatory response, the most obvious sources are urine which grew out sensitive klebsiella and the massive sacral ulcer.
No evidence of pulmonary infection based on CXR or respiratory status.
-agressive fluid hydration for early goal directed therapy, bolus prn for SBP <100, UOP <30 or elevated lactate.
Acute renal failure: - No prior labs since [**2153**], but at that time, baseline creatinine 0.9-1.1.
- Kinair bed was obtained as wound was markedly moist - plastic surgery debrided at bedside once, waited for INR to decrease for further debridment, which was repeated when the INR was 1.7 on [**6-14**].
Bacterial UTI: - UA with WBC, bacteria, blood, leukesterase.
- Cultures grew out klebsiella, which was sensitive to zosyn, however, more so to unasyn.
therapy of 14 days.
- monitor for bleeding - held coumadin until INR <2,  can be restarted once no evidence of ongoing bleeding.
CAD: - No ischemia on ECG - Continue ASA, statin - Beta-blocker was held in setting of possible sepsis.
Transaminitis - This was most likely shock liver, although an occult gallstone certainly could have been present, which would have explained the initial shock as cholangitis, but would have passed prior to his arrival, as this improved steadily over his stay  13.
