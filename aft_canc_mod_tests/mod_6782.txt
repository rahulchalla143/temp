TTE [**10-31**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
ERCP REPORT [**10-29**]: A metal stent placed in the biliary duct was found in the major papilla.
Subsequent occlusion cholangiogram demonstrated normal filling of the CBD and the right intrahepatics.
Metallic stent identified in the common bile duct.
OSH hospital records: CT abd/pelvis with contrast [**2137-9-18**]: 2.5 x 3cm mass in porta hepatis which shows encasement of the portal vein.
Following the procedure, the pt was hypotensive to 80/50, asymptomatic, and then spiked a temp to 102.6.
CTA [**10-31**] showed no PE but some pulm congestoion/small effusions.
TTE [**10-31**] showed normal EF with 2+ TR and borderline pulm HTN.
As for diagnosing exactly what type of malignancy, she underwent EUS on [**10-31**] with attempt to biopsy mass, but the porta hepata mass was not identified.
CT reconstruction showed mass in liver hilum, near porta hepatis, with occlusion of portal vein/encasement of hepatic artery.
Plan was for CT guided biopsy but there was hesitance given high risk of bleeding given location.
There was an attempt by radiology to get diagnostic paracenthesis [**11-1**] (CT showed ascites but done after large IVFs) but no fluid.
You are now doing better and will go home to complete oral antibiotic course We are trying to get a biopsy of the mass near your liver but were not able to get this done while you were here.
Given its location near the blood vessels, it is high risk, so we will try to do this under CT guidance on Tuesday [**11-5**] at 9am.
