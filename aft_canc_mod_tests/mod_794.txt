She was referred for an MRI by her PCP and was found to have multiple vertebral metastases.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.4, pulse 91.
The blood pressure was 164/94, respirations 18, saturating 97% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:  White count 4.6, hematocrit 30.9, platelets 101,000.
Sodium 138, K 3.0, chloride 95, bicarbonate 27, BUN 19, creatinine 0.6, glucose 114, calcium 10.7, ALT 171, AST 90, alkaline phosphatase 217, lipase 53, total bilirubin 0.4, free calcium 1.36.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  The patient is a 54-year-old female with a left upper lobe lung mass with multiple liver and bony metastases in the spine seen by imaging studies over the last month.
In further detail, the patient had a CT scan on [**2191-2-4**] of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
The CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at this time showed a new large mass in the left upper lobe of the lung concerning for lung cancer.
The MR of the cervical and lumbar spine dated [**2191-2-6**] were notable for diffuse marrow signal abnormalities, indicative of marrow hypoplasia or infiltrative processes.
In regards to the cervical spine, the study was limited since only sagittal T2 images could be obtained because of patient discomfort.
This was a limited examination but on a sagittal T2 weighted images of the cervical area, there were no foci or abnormal signal intensities in these regions.
Further hematology/oncology workup included a bone marrow biopsy on [**2191-2-10**].
The bone marrow biopsy showed that the aspirate was almost entirely infiltrated with neoplastic cells with high nucleocytoplasmic ratio.
The biopsy slides also showed marrow packed with approximately 90% of the trabecular space infiltrated by malignant cells showing scant amount of cytoplasm.
Finally, of note, the patient had her left upper lobe lung biopsy which showed cells consistent with small cell carcinoma.
The corresponding bronchial washings obtained with the biopsy were positive for malignant cells consistent with small cell carcinoma.
Since the treatment with the chemotherapy, the patient had afterwards become neutropenic with white blood cell count of approximately 0.3.
During the hospital course, the patient had received blood cell transfusions with red blood cells.
Her 02 saturations on [**2191-2-7**] had gone down to the mid 80s on room air which had improved to the low 90s on nasal cannula.
She had a CT angiogram at that time which revealed no evidence of PE; however, the study was somewhat limited due to motion artifact.
In addition, the CT angio revealed a large left upper lobe mass and hilar adenopathy which had been seen on previous CTs.
At this time, the patient was noted to have a temperature to 101.7 and had been started on a ten day course of levofloxacin and clindamycin for the infiltrate and fever.
A repeat bronchoscopy showed complete obstruction of the left main stem bronchus with multiple clots.
Chest x-ray at that time revealed partial clot to the left upper lobe and interstitial involvement of the right lung field.
The patient had been transferred to the MICU for further evaluation of her respiratory status.
She had an echocardiogram performed at the bedside to further evaluate the etiology of the patient's shortness of breath.
The echocardiogram had a left ventricular systolic function low normal at 50-55%, mild 1+ aortic regurgitation, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.
The infiltrates showed that there were patchy bilateral infiltrates, predominantly in the upper lung zones.
At this time, the patient had been neutropenic with a white blood cell count of 0.3.
A chest x-ray at this time revealed the persistent left hilar mass with collapse of the left upper lobe; however, the remainder of the lung fields were well aerated and the opacities previously seen on the right side were not observed and there was interval improvement of the pleural effusion on the left side.
