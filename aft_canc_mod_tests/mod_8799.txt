His last echo on [**2197-9-21**] showed peak aortic gradient of 46, mean of 30.3 and [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.4 cm2.
In the cath lab today, he was found to have left main distal stenosis of 60-70% (borderline) and a valve gradient 15-20 mm with calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.2-1.3, therefore valvuloplasty was deferred.

[**9-28**] CARDIAC ECHO Color-flow imaging of the interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this study.
LV systolic function appears mildly-to-moderately depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondeary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-8-8**], the right ventricle now appears somewhat hypokinetic.
[**9-27**] CARDIAC CATH 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated left main coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated filling pressures with a LVEDP of 40 mmHg and a RVEDP of 24 mmHg.
There was severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 75/34 mmHg.
The cardiac index was normal at 2.5 L/min/m2.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
Cath showed LM 80% lesion, rec'd DES with good result.
# Acute on chronic systolic congestive Heart Failure: Volume overloaded on exam with scrotal and peripheral edema.
# Aortic Stenosis: While ECHO [**2197-9-21**] showed severe stenosis, cath here demonstrated only moderate area 0.96 and valve gradient 15.01 therefore valvuloplasty was deferred.
EF 45% on repeat ECHO.
His INR as 1.9 on discharge and his coumadin dose was 5 mg, decreased to 4mg on [**10-4**].
His INR should be checked again on [**10-5**].
New anemia since cath in mid 20's although this is close to pts baseline.
Hct on d/c 28.
#Lower extremity pain/edema: DVT ruled out with LE doppler.
