As a result, a CT torso was obtained on [**2170-10-5**] and the preliminary read showed multiple masses suggestive of lymphoma.
Per OMR records, the patient has a long-standing history of abdominal pain since [**2164**] but imaging was obtained only recently.
Based on the results of his CT scan, the patient was referred to the ED for further evaluation.
There, his LDH was 1095, uric acid 22.6, AST 66, ALT 48, and sodium 129.
He was subsequently admitted to OB on TB precautions for further workup of his grossly abnormal CT scan.

Immunostains for CMV, and HSV [**1-3**] are negative as well.
Pathology Examination .
INTERPRETATION The immunophenotypic findings in conjunction with histological and immunohistochemical studies are consistent with a diagnosis of plasmablastic lymphoma (HHV8 negative subtype) .
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2170-10-9**] 2:21 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-8**], there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2170-10-10**] at 10:46:11 AM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

# Abdominal Pain/Lymphadenopathy:  Pt presented with diffuse and achy abdominal pain, which he had for the preceding month.
A CT torso was performed on [**2170-10-5**], with preliminary read showing multiple masses suggestive of lymphoma.
He was referred to the ED for evaluation; his LDH was 1095 and uric acid 22.6.
A bone marrow biopsy was obtained surgery was emergently consulted for to obtain tissue.
The patiet underwent a mini ex-lap and axillary lymphnode disection for biopsy.
Both bone marrow and abdominal lymphnode biopsies demonstrated plasmablastic lymphoma.
A discrepancy was noted between his oxygen saturations and PaO2 on ABG.
Methemoglobin level was noted to be elevated at 10%.
Sputum from [**9-27**] had been positive for minimal AFB, concerning for either profound immunosuppression, noncompliance, and/or MDR TB.
MTD testing was negative for M. Tuberculosis on [**10-3**].
Induced sputum samples from [**10-10**] and [**10-12**] were negative for AFB on gram stain.
Repeat cultures were obtained on [**10-15**] and were pending at the time of discharge.
His last CD 4 156 with VL 489,000.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of abdominal pain.
You underwent a bone marrow biopsy and biopsy of lymphnodes which showed that you had a type of cancer known as lymphoma.
