Of note, his anion gap during that admission was elevated to 19, and 15 on discharge.
VS were 96.3, 94, 122/74, RR 16, 97% RA.
A KUB showed dilated small bowel loops improved since last KUB.
His labs were notable for an HCO3 of 18, with a gap of 20, a glucose of 286, and a WBC count of 23 which is actually lower than usual.
A UA showed ketonuria and glucosuria.
His AG increased to 21, with a glucose of 300, and he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Colon Ca - stage III s/p L hemicolectomy in 98, s/p chemo with 5FU, leucovorin.

AXR ([**8-6**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels, which is concerning for small bowel obstruction, possibly.
This would be better characterized with CT scan.
EKG [**8-7**]:  NSR at 75 bpm, Q waves in the inferolateral leads suggestive of old inferolateral MI, unchanged.
CT chest/abd/pelvis - [**2113-8-18**] IMPRESSION: 1) Mechanical small bowel obstruction involving the stomach, afferent loop leading from the hepaticojejunostomy, and the proximal small bowel with a transition point in the right mid abdomen, and new pneumobilia, likely related to the small bowel obstruction.
In terms of etiology, cultures sent, CXR obtained, though patient without localizing signs of infection and WBC actually lower than usual, afebrile.
Electrolytes were repleted accordingly.
Anion gap remained closed and symptoms improved over course of admission.
2 days later morning labs showed AG of 30 he was again given IVF, and insulin.
The patient's code status was changed to DNR/DNI and labs were no longer drawn on the floor with the exception of fingersticks.
Because the pt could tolerate less and less oral intake due to painful hiccoughs, his BG remained low and insulin was cut back.
The insulin was stopped and fingersticks were cut back to qday as the patient's status declined.
Serial abdominal exams did not reveal any evidence of further obstruction.
Admission CXR showed mild initial CHF so reluctant to give significant amounts IVF during his stay.
Lab draws were stopped at least a week prior to discharge.
4) Pancreatic Cancer: Increase in abdominal LAD on recent CT scan.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] from palliative care was consulted who gave several recommendations around managing hiccups.
Labs were not drawn thereafter.
Patient's O2 saturations were maintained in the high 90's on room air during his stay with no respiratory problems.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] knows the patient and was reconsulted prior to his discharge.
