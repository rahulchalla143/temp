SOB - With history of recent aspiration PNA, patient was sent back to [**Hospital1 18**] without overt signs of new/worsening PNA but increased O2 requirement.
Her course was complicated by new evidence of pleural effusions and overload in setting of BNP > [**2115**] with no h/o CHF.
She had two ICU transfers while here given her tendancy to drop her oxygen saturation to the 70s on a NRB mask with stable blood pressure.
Given the patient's poor prognosis and family meeting was held and it was decided that no further escalation in care should be performed including future blood draws.
