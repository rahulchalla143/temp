CXR [**2119-8-13**]: No acute intrathoracic process.
CXR [**2119-8-14**]: There is interval development of right lung consolidation, mostly involving the right lower lobe, but also affecting the right upper lobe, extensive and given its rapid development might be consistent with interval aspiration.
CXR [**2119-8-16**]: There is interval improvement in the right basilar opacity which currently right perihilar lower lung abnormality demonstrated that might be consistent with resolution of massive aspiration giving complete absence of the abnormalities on [**8-13**], [**2119**], radiograph and its rapid development on [**2119-8-14**] radiograph.
CXR [**2119-8-20**]: There is improved aeration bilaterally.
CT abd/pelvis [**2119-8-13**]: 1.
CT head [**2119-8-13**]: 1.
CT cervical spine [**2119-8-13**]: 1.
Non-contrast head CT showed no evidence of bleed.
CT C-spine showed no fracture or malalignment.
Echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction, with no evident structural cause of syncope.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
The patient should consider repeat MRI/MRA as an outpatient for evaluation of the cerebral circulation (last examined in [**2117**]).
Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient presented with a creatinine of 2.4, up from baseline 1.1.
At the time of discharge, the patient's creatinine was between 1.0 to 1.2.
The patient will need to have his creatinine monitored weekly after discharge from the hospital.
The patient's potassium was monitored closely and remained in the normal range.
The patient will need his potassium checked weekly following discharge from the hospital.
Echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction.
Lisinopril was restarted for improved blood pressure control, and was dosed in the evening, as the patient tended to be most hypertensive at night.
The patient will need blood pressure monitored closely following discharge from the hospital.
Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate, although it was not clear if this was a true infiltrate or if it was pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive emergency.
By the time of discharge, the patient's fevers had resolved, his chest x-ray had improved, and his lung exam had normalized.
Anemia:  The patient presented with hematocrit 23.
Further evaluation revealed microcytosis and severe iron deficiency (ferritin 5).
His hematocrit remained stable throughout the admission.
He should follow up with his primary care provider for further evaluation of his iron deficiency anemia.
Diabetes mellitis: On admission, the patient's blood glucose was elevated to greater than 400.
He will need frequent insulin checks (4x/day) and insulin administration throughout the day.
The patient's Celexa and trazodone were continued, with no dosage change.
Medications on Admission: Fish oil 1000mg daily Vitamin C 500mg daily Citalopram 60mg daily Lipitor 20mg daily Glyburide 5mg daily Lisinopril 10mg daily Cyanocoabalamine 1000mcg injection qmonth ASA 325mg daily Mom[**Name (NI) 6474**] 0.1 cream daily to eyebrows and nose Ammonium lac [**Hospital1 **] to back Docusate 100mg [**Hospital1 **] Risperidone 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] Welchol 1250mg [**Hospital1 **] Lamisil Cream [**Hospital1 **] to affected area Mi-acid 30mL [**Hospital1 **] Meclizine 25mg tid Metformin 750mg tid Ayr saline nasal gel tid to nostrils Trazodone 50mg qhs Ranitidine 150mg qhs Senna 8.6mg 2 tabs qhs Artificial tears [**1-27**] gtt ou qid prn Blephamide S.O.P.
Secondary diagnoses: 1. history of stroke 2. schizoaffective disorder   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable, tolerating oral diet, no respiratory difficulties, improved blood pressure control, improved glycemic control   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital after losing consciousness and hitting your head.
You had a CT scan of your head and neck, which did not show any damage from the fall.
There, your blood pressure became very elevated one night, causing you to have difficulty breathing.
You will have to have your blood drawn about once per week to check your electrolytes and kidney function.
Followup Instructions: -Nephrology appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4883**] on Thursday, [**10-5**] at 11:00AM.
You will need weekly lab drawns to check your electrolytes (particularly potassium) and kidney function (creatinine).
If your creatinine continues to be high (>2), the healthcare providers at your new facility might decide to stop your new medication, lisinopril.
