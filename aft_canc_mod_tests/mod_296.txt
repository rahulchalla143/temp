MRI C/T/L spine: No cord compression is seen.
Further evaluation with abdominal and pelvic CT recommended.
CT Abd/PElvis: The lung bases demonstrate a small left greater than right pleural effusion.
The abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable without evidence of pneumatosis, free air or obstruction.
A penile implant and post prostatectomy clips somewhat limit evaluation of the distal ureters.

UA with 11-20 WBCs and moderate bacteria therefore he was started on zosyn presumptively.
This was narrowed to ciprofloxacin then urine culture subsequently grew STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPHILIA therefore he was narrowed further to Bactrim.
Cortisol and thyroid functions tests were done to rule out hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency and these were normal.
Sodium corrected to 128 with IVF resuscitation.
# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 2.4 on admission, trending down to baseline of 1.2 with IV fluid resuscitation.
He underwent MRI T/L spine to r/o cord compression which was negative but subsequently had pelvic CT that did show pelvis mass impinging on sciatic nerve.
INR on admission sub-therapeutic at 1.6 .
His albumin was low and ensure supplements were encouraged.
# Chronic systolic heart failure (non-ischemic): Patient with an  EF of 45% on his last TTE secondary to chemotherapy.

We gave you some IV fluids to improve your blood pressure.
We did an MRI which did not show compression of our spinal cord but did show a pelvic mass that is the likely reason for your weakness.
You will need some labs drawn next week and to meet with your PCP to determine whether to continue this medication.
