CHANGE PERC TUBE OR CATH W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2126-12-16**] 1.Antegrade nephrostogram demonstrating a persistent leak involving the proximal third of the left ureter in the region of ureteral injury.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2126-12-19**] IMPRESSION: 1)New bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left causing overlying compressive atelectasis, no consolidation.
An MRI is more sensitive than CT for the detection of ischemic changes and is recommended if clinically indicated and if there are no contraindications to the use of MRI in this patient.
Seen by surgery who did not feel that the abdomen was the concerning source but recommended CT A/P to eval.
Seen by Neurosurgery to eval new head CT in setting of altered MS initially.
CT head done as well.
History of recent PE but INR therapeutic so less likely worsening or new embolism.
Diuresis was held secondary to hypotenstion and serial abg's were obtained.
CT showed concern for anastamotic leak with extraluminal PO contrast.
Instead, the patient underwent a CT guided drainage procedure.
Analysis of fluid showed elevated level of creatinine, concerning for urine.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 7749**] appeared confused at times, a urine sample was sent and it was positive for a UTI.
A repeat head ct was obtained, showing no changes and neurology was called and belived that the cause of confusion was secondary to her UTI.
