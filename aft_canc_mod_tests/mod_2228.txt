He had an ECHO that showed EF 30% c/w NYHA heart failure class [**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely need an ICD in the future.
Staging workup showed disease in the left neck and mediastinum as well as the hilar regions and mesentery.
His bone marrow was negative at that time.
- FDG scan showed persistent avidity in the anterior cervical lymph node chain as well as the mid abdominal area.
Therefore completed consolidative XRT with an involved field boost to the anterior cervical nodes and epigastric area and then proceed with high-dose chemotherapy.
- [**1-17**] Autologous SCT - 4 weeks posttransplant of Rituxan - XRT to L abdomen for faint residual uptake in the left abdomen, after which the avidity resolved and he was in remission.
Abd CT showed a mesenteric mass in the LUQ highly suggestive of tumor.
- [**2119-11-29**] he underwent surgery with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], biopsy revealed extensive scar tissue with no evidence for carcinoid or lymphomatous involvement.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an e' of <0.08m/s c/w an elevated left ventricular filling pressure (>12mmHg).
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR ([**9-11**]): Moderate volume left pleural effusion has been stable since [**9-4**] and atelectasis at the medial aspect of the left lower lobe has improved.
CT abdomen/pelvis ([**9-15**]): 1) Large 5.4 x 3.8 cm calcified central mesenteric mass with spoke wheel retraction of the adjacent mesenteric fat.
Peritoneal fluid ([**9-15**]): NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
ECG ([**9-15**]): Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2120-9-11**] occasional ventricular premature beats are new.
CXR ([**9-16**]): No change in comparison to the prior study.
Bone marrow biopsy ([**9-17**]): Acute monocytic leukemia (FAB-M5b) evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome.
Peritoneal fluid ([**9-19**]): NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
WBC reached a high of 49,300; on [**9-25**], WBC 14,000 with 15% blasts, Hct 31.1, Platelets 85,000, ANC 3720 Please see OMR for further details on laboratory studies   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 35695**] is a 61 year old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post auto stem cell transplant and subsequent myelodysplastic syndrome status post mini-allo stem cell transplant (day 0 = [**2120-3-27**]), with sclerosing peritonitis secondary to radiation with recent admissions for neutropenic fever thought to be due to SBP or pneumonia, who was readmitted with fever and hypotension.
# MDS --> leukemia: The patient's hematocrit and platelets remained stable, but he was transfused for hct <25, plt <10.
A bone marrow biopsy on [**8-29**] demonstrated CD34 positive blasts comprise 6% of total events.
A repeat marrow done [**2120-9-13**]->aspirate results show 64% monocytes and peripheral smear shows 10% monos->acute monocytic leukemia M5B.
The patient did receive hydroxyurea starting on [**9-18**] for escalating white counts with a decrease in his WBC count from 49.3 to 14.
Blood cultures at that time were negative.
His urine was positive for leukocytes but no WBCs seen, some yeast forms.
A CXR was negative, and he had no diarrhea.
We did monitor BP closely, but avoided fluid boluses as was possible due to fluid third-spacing.
A cortisol stim test on [**9-22**] did not demonstrate hypoadrenalism.
# CHF: By ECHO NYHA class 3. .
# CKD: His creatinine remained stable at 1.5. .
