Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 17226**] was admitted [**2192-8-25**] after a witnessed sz and fall at home.
A head CT showed a 2.8cm R parietotemporal mass with edema, no midline shift.
This patient presented with a single seizure and CAT scan and MRI scan revealed an irregularly contrasting enhancing mass in the right parietal lobe.
The patient was also demented since several years and the torso CT showed multiple lung lesions.
After extensive discussions of the pros and cons, the family wished a serial stereotactic biopsy to be done so that a definitive histological diagnosis could be obtained and any further measures could be decided upon on the basis of a definitive diagnosis of the lesion and the pertinent prognostic outlook.
The stereotactic brain biopsy was conducted on [**2192-8-31**].
Post-operatively PO intake was decreased and a 3 day calorie count was done and PO intake was encouraged.
