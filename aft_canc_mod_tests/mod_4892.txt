The patient's blood pressure was responsive to fluid boluses.
Once his blood pressure was stable he was transferred to the medical team.
His leukocytosis trended down.
An assay for c. diff was never sent as his stools were normal and his white blood cell count normalized.
Given bibasilar consolidations and patchy opacities on CT scan, it was felt most likely aspiration, however with recent hospitalization the patient was covered with vanco/zosyn for possible HCAP.
Hematocrit trended down to 23.2 and he required one unit of blood.
#Diabetes Mellitus Type II: patient was covered with humalog sliding scale and glucose levels remained <200 without any episodes of hypoglycemia.
You blood pressure was increased with intravenous fluids.
At discharge, your blood pressure and heart rate were normal.
