On arrival to the ER the pt was found to have peaked T waves on his EKG and a potassium of 7.0, for which he received calcium gluconate, bicarb, insulin, and kayexelate 30mg x 2 with no response.
ABG was 6.94/8/160.
Bicarb was <5.
Cr was 10.8 (baseline 2).
He was given levo/flagyl because he "looked bad" and was hypothermic to 33 degrees celsius rectally, in order cover possible infectious sources in the abdomen although his examination and other vital signs were benign.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn and are pending.
Labs immediately before dialysis showed a bicarb of 18, K of 6.5, Cr 9. .

Normal Doppler ultrasound evaluation of the liver.
Cholangiogram showed dilation CBD to 12 mm and panc duct to 6 mm.
Per renal consult saw muddy brown casts on urine microscopy and by the end of hospitalization, the patient's urine output was 1-2 L per day signifying this was probably ATN.
A renal bx was never done as by the time pt was stable enough to have one, his urine output improved markedly.
Additionally, it was noted on imaging that the patient has a size discrepancy in his kidneys and an MRA showed moderate renal artery stenosis of right renal artery.
During the ERCP, an endoscopy was performed and gastritis was found.
Thought that perhaps this was secondary to DIC as PT/INR were also elevated, but DIC labs were wnl on serial checks over the course of 5 days.
Patient received a total of 8 units of pRBC's with a transfusion threshold of >25.
He also had a pmibi which was normal.
Held lisinopril, hctz and amlodipine which have been unnecessary since starting dialysis.
While in the hospital your liver function tests were abnormal and an ERCP was done and a stent was placed.
Biopsy was obtained at that time and showed adenocarcinoma of the ampulla.
