The patient was diagnosed with RCC in [**2191**] and is s/p left nephrectomy.
He also has metastatic disease to the lung, s/p IL2 therapy cycle 1 in [**2192-7-25**] and cycle 2 in [**2192-11-25**].
The patient went to [**Hospital **] Hospital at [**State 1727**] today where a MRI revealed a cerebellar mass with associated shift.
Neurosurgery eval was requested due reported mass effect seen on MRI and q4 neuro checks + dexamethasone was recommended.
CT scan showed 6-mm noncalcified nodule in the anterior right middle lobe and a possible second nodule slightly more inferior; bone scan negative; PET CT showed activity in left kidney tumor but no abnormal FDG uptake in the lungs.
A single focus of increased activity in the left lobe of the thyroid was noted and a thyroid ultrasound was recommended.
[**2192-5-25**] surveillance CT scan showed multiple new pulmonary nodules and enlargement of previously noted nodules.
Referred for high-dose IL-2 treatment at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2192-6-25**] Multiple R lung wedge resections; RML path shows RCC mets [**2192-7-25**] IL2 Therapy at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2192-11-25**] IL2 Therapy [**Date range (1) 83379**]; [**2111-5-15**]: chest CT with post-obstructive consolidation, concerning for endobronchial lesion causing obstruction.
Biopsy revealed clear cell carcinoma.
[**2193-7-5**]: bronchoscopy and photodynamic therapy to RUL and RLL endobronchial lesions [**2193-7-8**]: rigid bronchoscopy with mechanical tumor debridement [**2193-8-25**]: Cyberknife to right upper lobe lesion; [**2194-5-10**] CT torso with 1.
DTRs 2+ BL.
[**2194-9-29**] MRI Brain with and without contrast: expected postop changes  Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  63 yo M with metastatic RCC presenting with HA, ataxia and new cerebellar lesion, likely due to metastatic RCC.
# Brain lesion: - continue Dexamethasone 4mg Q6h (RSS and H2blocker with steroids) - will request neurosurgery consult given mass effect - Q4h neuro exam - review OSH records once available - obtain baseline labs as OSH not available .
CT head was obtained which revealed expected post-op changes.
On [**9-30**] an MRI was done which showed expected postoperative changes.
