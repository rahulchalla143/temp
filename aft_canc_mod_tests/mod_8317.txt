The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
An eccentric, XXX directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
CXR showed new infiltrates and elevated TnT on admission which downtreneded and likely represents non-ST elevation MI due to demand ischemia in the setting of prolonged hypoxia.
# Community Acquired Pneumonia: Patient was admitted with a WBC of 24.8, 85% PMNs, which resolved over the course of her hospitalization.
Chest xray in the ED showed new bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
# NSTEMI/ CHF exacerbatoin: Patient had a rise in cardiac troponins (max 0.31) and CKMB (max 18) on presentation which began trending downward on hospital day 1.
She had mild STE noted in V1 and V2 on EKG compared to prior studies.
She was treated with aspirin and a 48 hour heparin drip, and cardiac echo showed new wall motion abnormality in region of PDA.
She had no EKG changes suggestive of PE, and cardiac echo showed new wall motion abnormality more suggestive of recent MI.
Given this low probability and due to her diminished renal function and GFR, CT angiogram was not pursued.
Due to low probability of PE and the fact that V/Q scan would likely be unrevealing in the setting of pulmonary edema (demonstrated on X ray), V/Q scan was also not pursued.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Patient's creatinine on presentation was 1.5, up from her baseline of 0.8-1.0.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] on vacation) who agreed to follow up labs as outpatient, as patient was anxious to go home.
She was instructed to not take her lasix day after discharge and wil have her labs checked on Friday, [**3-1**].
