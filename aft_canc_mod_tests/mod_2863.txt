His symptoms began 1 week prior to admission, when he awoke with malaise, cough, and sore throat.
A CXR revealed RLL and RUL infiltrates, and his wbc count was 13.2 with mild L shift.
He was additionally noted to be in ARF with creatinine 1.8.
Clinically he worsened rapidly; on the second day of admission he was noted to be dyspneic, cyanotic, with ABG 7.45/19/65, and patient intubated with serosanguinous secretions.
An echo done later that night showed a large pericardial effusion, and decision was made to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for pericardiocentesis and pigtail catheter placement.

Baseline right atrial pressure was markedly elevated with a mean pressure of 30 mmHg.
Upon entry into the pericardial space, the  pericardial pressure was entrained with the RA pressure tracing (mean of 30 mmHg).
The last 200 cc of fluid were bright red, with a saturation of 95%.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated minimal luminal  irregularities, with no obstructive lesions in the LMCA, LAD, LCX, or RCA.
Post-pericardiocentesis hemodynamics demonstrated marked respiratory variation in the intracardiac pressure tracings, with pericardial pressure of 10mmHg, and RA pressure remaining elevated.
The PCWP was elevated at 18mmHg, and the cardiac index was low-normal.
The patient's blood pressure was markedly improved at the end of the  procedure.
Cardiogenic shock 4.
Correlative contrast enhanced chest CT may be helpful for better assessment if warranted clinically, as communicated to the clinical house staff caring for the patient.
Multifocal pulmonary opacities most prominent in the right upper lobe and retrocardiac portions of the lower lobes, which may be due to the history of pneumonia.
TTE [**2153-1-2**]:  Conclusions: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2153-1-1**], the findings are similar.
CT TORSO w/wout contrast [**2153-1-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE [**2153-1-4**]:  Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
CT head [**2153-1-6**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial metastases.
Bone Scan [**2153-1-8**]:  IMPRESSION: No foci of osseous metastatic disease.
Note: Immunocytochemical studies were performed on cytospin   slides.
1) Hypotension, shock:  Thought to be cardiogenic in nature, secondary to tamponade as demonstrated on echo and confirmed in the cath lab.
The pathology on the fluid returned with poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.
His effusion was followed with serial echo and did not reaccumulate during his stay.
3) Non-small cell lung cancer:  A CT of his chest demonstrated a 3.5 x 3.5 cm mass within the right upper lobe medially; areas of collapse/consolidation adjacent to this; extensive lymphadenopathy within the prevascular, pretracheal, subcarinal, and right hilar regions, the largest lymph node conglomerate measuring 2.3 x 5.8 cm in the subcarinal region; no pathologically enlarged axillary lymph nodes; 3.1 x 2.7 cm right paratracheal lymph node as well as a 2.4 x 2.9 cm left prevascular lymph node; right hilar lymph node measuring approximately 2.8 x 2.7 cm.
A staging workup was negative for brain or bone metastases, and the remainder of his CT did not show intra-abdominal metastases.
On arrival his creatinine was 2.1, which trended down with fluids to 0.5 on discharge.
6) Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  He had a gap acidosis on arrival, thought secondary to his lactate of 14, which trended down concurrent with gap closure.
His transaminases trended down during the course of the admission, bilirubin peaking at 1.6, ALT at 3119, AST at 3424.
His MB fraction and index were both normal.
His CK peaked at 2809, and then trended down.
10) Anemia:  His iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
