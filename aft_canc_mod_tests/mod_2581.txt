EKG [**3-4**]: Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing these changes are less marked .
MRI with SBFT [**3-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Stool in the colon Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Plan as per inpatient GI team.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 39221**] is 62M with history of achalasia s/p [**Doctor Last Name **] myotomy in [**12/2111**] c/b chronic GI bleeding, recent STEMI s/p DESx2 (on ASA & Plavix), LVEF 30% with apical akinesis (treated with coumadin, later discontinued when LVEF recovered to >55%), h/o internal hemorroids, recent admission for lower GI bleed who was admitted with melena and Hct 19. .
HCT 26->19 within 1 week.
Received 1 L NS and 1U PRBCs in the ED and was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], where he was transfused two more units.
Hct was monitored closely and stabilized around 26-29.
Iron studies were consistent with severe iron deficiency anemia.
HCT remained between 19-32 during admission, but remained between 29-34 since [**3-5**].
HCT was 32.2 on day of discharge.
Urine cx grew citrobacter koseri, which is sensitive to cipro.
# bilateral lower extremity edema: Clinically not consistent with CHF as pt did not have elevation of JVD, hypoxia, or noticeable pulmonary edema/effusions, and cardiac echo showed a normal EF without evidence of heart failure or valvular dysfunction.
UA showed moderate proteinuria, so spot urine protein/creatinine ratio was checked and was unremarkable, 0.2.
Colonoscopy revealed non-bleeding hemorrhoids.
# CAD: Acute GIB with marked anemia was very concerning in setting of recent STEMI in [**12/2111**] with DES x2.
EKG without acute ischemic changes, MB and CK neg.
Statin, ACEI, and statin were also continued.
