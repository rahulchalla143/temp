Recently prior to her Whipple procedure, she underwent a esophagogastroduodenoscopy with stent change by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and this had shown a mass pushing on the duodenum consistent with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
She had prior CT scans that really did not show anything consistent with an actual mass.
Although on her prior scans, they did show a segment seven lesion in the liver that was approximately 1.5 cm in diameter that was suspicious for possible metastatic disease.
She had a 1500 cc estimated blood loss, 400 cc urine output during the operation, and received 8.5 liters of Crystalloid.
Postoperative BUN and creatinine was 6 and 0.3.
She had a potassium of 4.
Her sodium levels were within normal limits.
Her blood glucose was otherwise normal.
She had LFTs with an alkaline phosphatase of 131, an ALT and AST of 91 and 66 with an amylase of 13 and a total bilirubin of 0.7 with a lipase of 42.
Ultimately on postoperative day #3, the amylase and total bilirubin was sent from this drain which revealed an amylase of 12 and total bilirubin of 0.7.
She underwent a T-t cholangiogram at this time as well.
Abdominal x-ray was acquired at this time, which showed the stomach to be somewhat distended.
A CT scan was acquired on postoperative day #15 to rule out any abnormal fluid collection, abscess, etc to explain why she may in-fact be having difficulty with oral intake and nausea and emesis.
CT scan at that time showed postsurgical changes that were noted in the region of the pancreatic body consistent with the patient's recent Whipple procedure, but there were no abnormal fluid collections or abscess formations seen given a relatively normal study.
Her temperature was 98.7 with a heart rate of 73, a blood pressure of 128/66, respiratory rate was 18, and 96% on room air saturation.
Her discharge laboratories are noted for a white count of 6.4, hematocrit of 33.1, and a platelet count of 293.
Her sodium was 140, potassium was 4.5, her chloride was 107 with a bicarb of 20, BUN and creatinine were 15 and 0.3 with a glucose of 138.
Her calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels were 9.3, 1.7, and 4.0 respectively.
She had an albumin of 3.6, total bilirubin of 0.4, amylase of 31, ALT was 60 with an AST value of 39, alkaline phosphatase was 284 and lipase 47.
The final pathology shows frozen sections revealed left lateral segment bile duct hemartoma with lymph node showing lipogranuloma, but no carcinoma.
The mass from the head of her pancreas revealed a pancreatic adenocarcinoma that was moderately differentiated.
