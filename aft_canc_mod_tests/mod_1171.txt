A follow-up CT scan in [**2103-6-8**] and [**2103-9-8**] showed interval worsening of the pulmonary nodules as well as retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
In [**2103-10-8**], an isolated brain metastases was discovered, status post suboccipital craniotomy with resection of tumor and stereotactic radiosurgery in [**2103-11-8**].
There, a CT angiogram showed small filling defects of tertiary branches of his pulmonary vasculature and a pericardial effusion.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was comfortable, with a heart rate in the 120s and a blood pressure 110 to 120/70.
His oxygen saturation was 98% on two liters.
A repeat CT angiogram showed tiny nonocclusive filling defects in the lower lobes bilaterally, consistent with emboli, and a large pericardial effusion with a pulsus of 30.
An emergent echocardiogram was performed that was consistent with tamponade.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient was a pleasant male in no acute distress who was afebrile with a heart rate of 115, respiratory rate 20s, blood pressure 90s/60s with an oxygen saturation of 98% on two liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Unremarkable.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 11.6, hematocrit 29.7, platelet count 237,000 and normal differential.
Coagulation studies showed a prothrombin time of 14.6, INR 1.5 and partial thromboplastin time 34.1.
Chem-7 showed a sodium of 135, chloride 101, bicarbonate 20, BUN 22 and creatinine 1.4.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with biphasic P waves but normal voltage criteria after catheterization.
The drain was successfully removed after a repeat echocardiogram showed minimal reaccumulation and he had drained less than 25 cc over 24 hours.
A repeat echocardiogram performed 24 hours after the drain was pulled showed no further reaccumulation of fluid.
After the repeat echocardiogram after drain removal was negative, the patient was discharged home to follow up with an echocardiogram in three days to evaluate for recurrence of the fluid.
