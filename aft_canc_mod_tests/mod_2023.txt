Multiple CT scans revealed no evidence of obstruction and her ileus was attributed to inflammation and irritation from the necrotic omentum.
On [**12-18**], the patient was found to be less responsive with increasing respiratory effort and arterial blood gas revealed a PH of 7.22, PCO2 100 and PO2 84 on three liters of oxygen.
Sputum culture from [**12-18**] subsequently grew MRSA and the patient was treated with a 10 day course of Vancomycin for presumptive MRSA pneumonia.
From a GI standpoint CT of the abdomen on [**12-16**] revealed a communication between Hartmann's pouch and the peritoneal cavity with an abdominal fluid collection consistent with abscess.
From an ID standpoint, [**4-24**] blood culture bottles from [**12-5**] and [**12-6**] grew coag negative staph which was treated with a 10 day course of Vancomycin.
Surveillance cultures from [**1-17**] revealed no growth to date.
Blood culture from [**12-18**] subsequently grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] and the patient completed a 14 day course of Fluconazole on [**1-5**].
Lastly, a sputum from [**1-4**] grew pseudomonas.
The patient had a TTE on [**12-19**] which revealed left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% and unremarkable chamber sizes and thicknesses.
The patient reportedly had a cardiac catheterization at an outside hospital with a 30% LAD and 50% RCA occlusions.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's vital signs on admission, she had a temperature of 99.9, blood pressure 129/34, heart rate 78, breathing at 24, satting 100% on 4 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
Neck exam showed a jugulovenous pressure of approximately 8 cm of water.
She had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Patient on transfer had a white blood cell count of 11.6, hematocrit 32.2, platelet count 376,000.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.8, chloride 88, CO2 41, BUN 15, creatinine .4.
She had a chest x-ray from [**1-6**] which revealed interval improvement in upper zone redistribution with a small left pleural effusion and residual left lower lobe collapse with an opacity in the retrocardiac area most likely atelectasis.
She had a CT of the abdomen from [**12-16**] which revealed a collection of fluid and air within the abdomen with no identifiable Hartmann's pouch.
She had a CT on [**12-25**] which revealed a collection of fluid and air within the abdomen consistent with an intra-abdominal abscess.
She had a TTE on [**12-19**] which revealed an ejection fraction of 60%, left atrium mildly dilated, left ventricular thickness and cavity size normal, RV thickness and size normal, moderate mitral annular calcification and 1+ MR. Microbiologic data:  The patient had a sputum from [**1-4**] which grew 4+ pseudomonas, pansensitive.
Blood culture from [**12-28**] revealed no growth, from [**12-18**] [**1-25**] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**].
Urine from [**12-27**] revealed no growth.
Urine from [**12-18**] grew pansensitive enterococcus.
At the time of this dictation the patient was satting 95-97% on [**2-24**] liters of oxygen.
Her surveillance cultures were negative.
We followed her white blood cell count very closely and it remained within normal limits.
They felt that since the abdominal collection was draining into the rectal stump, no further surgical management was indicated.
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve with a decreasing oxygen requirement.
After a discussion with the family, we opted to have a PEG tube placed for ease of medication and tube feed administration, however, we recommend that the swallowing study be repeated in approximately one week.
