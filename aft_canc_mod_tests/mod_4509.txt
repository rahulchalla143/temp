He woke up and performed his usual activities, and at 9am sat down to read his newspaper and realized that he could not fold his newspaper, and could not correct the upside-down disposition of the pages.
The EMS was activated, and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 85745**] Hospital, where a CT scan was reported to demonstrate an ischemic stroke in the right parietal lobe with an area of subarachnoid hemorrhage superimposed.

CT ANGIOGRAPHY NECK: CT angiography of the neck demonstrates atherosclerotic disease and calcification at both carotid bifurcations without high-grade stenosis.
Correlation with chest CT recommended.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD: CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of vascular stenosis or occlusion.
Head CT shows vasogenic edema with a 1-cm hypodense area which could be suggestive of a hemorrhagic metastasis.
CT angiography of the head and neck demonstrates patent vascular structures with mild atherosclerotic disease.
Two enhancing lesions are identified on the right parietal lobe, the largest is noted on the inferior aspect of the right parietal lobe, with significant vasogenic edema.
Multiple foci of T2 and FLAIR signal are demonstrated in the subcortical white matter, likely reflecting chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
CT-ABD/CHEST/PELVIS [**2156-8-16**] IMPRESSION:  1.
Numerous small hypodense hepatic lesions, with the largest one measuring 17 mm in segment V, incompletely assessed in this single-phase study but could potentially represent biliary hamartomas and/or small hepatic cysts.
Post op CT Head [**8-20**]  1.
# Cards: On admission, given possibility of stroke, he was restarted on on atenolol and his BP was permitted to rise to 160.
preliminary pathology was consistent with metastatic carcinoma.
His post-op CT was stable and showed expected post-op changes, his post-op check was significant only for a slight left upper quadrantanopia.

?You will not need an MRI of the brain with/ or without gadolinium contrast.
If you are required to have a MRI, you may also require a blood test to measure your BUN and Cr within 30 days of your MRI.
