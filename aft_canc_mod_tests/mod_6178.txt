Given 6U PRBC at OSH; Nasogastric tube was in place, serial Hct was followed and he was on IV pantoprazole.
He underwent EGD on [**12-17**] which showed extensive clot and fresh blood oozing in the duodenal bulb.
He was given 3 units pRBCs and Hct slowly drifted down over the next 2 days.
Blood cultures were drawn on HD 3 in response to temp of 101.2, these were negative.
CT of the abdomen was concerning for duodenal ulcer as well as diffuse thickening of the stomach.
On [**2108-12-21**] he underwent angiogram which showed Celiac and SMA arteriogram demonstrated a vascular stump off the common hepatic artery believed to be the stump of the left hepatic artery, a replaced right hepatic artery supplied from the SMA, and GDA coming off of the common hepatic artery.
He was continuing to have transfusion requirements to maintain his hct and received an additional 25 units over the course of the week with 6 units the day that it was decided to take him to the OR for an exploratory lap with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for Gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy .
There was concern that this was an infiltrating cholangiocarcinoma, however frozen sections did not show evidence of malignancy and final pathology on the gastrectomy portion submitted showed: - Extensive hemorrhagic necrosis with associated transmural ulceration of the distal antrum/pylorus; focal microperforation is identified - Fundic and uninvolved antral mucosa with minimal chronic, inactive inflammation, focal hemorrhage and epithelial regeneration.
Again on [**12-28**]  he spiked temperature 101.8, repeat 101.5 and was pan cultured.
All urine, blood and sputum (from BAL) were no growth.
He was re cultured with the new fever and blood cultures are as yet negative but not finalized at the time of discharge.
His hematocrit was much more stable following the surgery with a requirement of 5 more units and then stable from POD 5 until discharge.
On [**1-1**] he underwent a barium study to determine the patency of the anastomosis.
A culture was obtained from the JP drain (peritoneal fluid) on [**1-7**] which grew Staph aureus.
