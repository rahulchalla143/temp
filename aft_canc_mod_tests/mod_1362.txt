HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1637**] is a 74 year old Caucasian gentleman who was initially diagnosed with diffuse large cell lymphoma in [**2129-9-12**], when he presented with fatigue, fevers, sweats and a hematocrit of 25.
A CT scan at that time showed diffuse adenopathy in the chest and abdomen and biopsy revealed large cell lymphoma.
A follow-up scan showed a significant response, although there was a question of residual adenopathy and by [**2130-3-13**], there was definite evidence of progression by CT scan.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were temperature 100.6 F.; blood pressure 138/70; pulse 90; respiratory rate 18 to 20; weight 72.5 kilograms, height 180 centimeters.
Lungs clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
Cardiac:  S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops heard.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 3.4, hemoglobin 11.0, hematocrit 33.3, platelet count 77,000.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.4, chloride 101, bicarbonate 21, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, total bilirubin 0.3, alkaline phosphatase 191, ALT 35, AST 42, LDH 469.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and blood cultures, urine cultures, urinalysis and Clostridium difficile toxin assay was sent.
A chest x-ray and a CT scan of the sinus was done to find the source of infection.
X-rays showed some bibasilar changes and so the patient was started on Levaquin 500 mg once a day and Acyclovir 400 mg three times a day because of a small ulcer found in the left nostril.
CT scan of his sinus was found to be negative and his chest x-ray was also found to be not significant and the patient, at that time, was only kept on Levaquin and for treatment of a possible urinary tract infection because his urinalysis showed some white blood cells and some bacteria.
A CT scan of the head was done to rule out any masses or any intracranial hemorrhage and a lumbar puncture was done which was also found to be not very significant.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was done without contrast to identify a possible source of abdominal infection secondary to an abscess, however, the CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed a splenic hemorrhage or splenic infarction leading to subscapular hemorrhage.
Surgery at that time thought that the patient was not an ideal candidate for surgery and so they recommended that he be transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management and also because hematocrit was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
He also had a bone marrow biopsy that was done on [**6-13**].

PT 14.0, PTT 42.5, INR 1.4.
Granulocyte count 990, glucose 87, BUN 46, creatinine 1.7.
