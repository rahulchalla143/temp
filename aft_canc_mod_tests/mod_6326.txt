CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST [**2125-12-6**]: Visualized portion of the cardiac apex and lung bases are clear.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, prostate, seminal vesicles, rectum and colon are unremarkable.
There is bilateral spondylolysis with spondylolisthesis of L5 over S1, measuring approximately 8 mm.
Correlation to history and laboratory values is recommended and an MRI would best evaluate the hepatic lesions and the etiology of the pancreatic ductal dilation.
Bilateral spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis of L5.
MR 3D RENDERING W/POST PROCESSING ON INDEPENDENT WS [**2125-12-10**]: 1.
Recommend ERCP to evaluate this focal pancreatic ductal stricture and to obtain brush samples.
Pathology [**2125-12-11**]: Sigmoid colon polyp #1, biopsy (A):      Adenoma.
Gastroesophageal junction, biopsy (D):      - Cardia-type mucosa with intestinal metaplasia, consistent with Barrett's esophagus; no dysplasia identified.
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2125-12-13**]: Pancreatic Tumor Table: I: Pancreatic tumor present: Possible yes.
Multiple small lymph nodes within the retroperitoneal area, which are not enlarged by CT criteria.
The left adrenal again appears thickened measuring 11 Hounsfield units on the non-contrast study consistent with an adrenal adenoma.
An ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation of these lesions.
An endoscopy may be considered to evaluate this finding.
EGD [**2125-12-11**]: Impression: Small hiatal hernia Salmon colored in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with Barrett's esophagus (biopsy) Deformity of the second part of the duodenum (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Please follow with biopsy Please consult ERCP team for EUS Please proceed with surgery consult .
Pt needs to have colonoscopy repeated for polypectomy.
ERCP [**2125-12-13**]: Impression: Limited examination of the esophagus and stomach were normal Due to the presence of an ulcer in the duodeum, the scope was not advanced beyond the duodenal bulb A 2.6 cm X 1.8 cm ill-defined mass was noted in the head of the pancreas - FNA was performed.
Colonoscopy [**2125-12-19**]: Impression: Polyp in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy) Polyp in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy) Polyps in the rectum (polypectomy, polypectomy) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to transverse colon Recommendations: Please follow biopsy results Consider a repeat colonoscopy in 1 year if patients over all clinical condition permits - to be scheduled through primary care physician's office .
Pancreatic head mass/liver mass:  He was found to have pancreatic head mass during the workup for his anemia.
Liver mass found in CT were identified as hemangiomas on MRCP.
#.Anemia / GI bleed: Patient's history and exam were consistent with chronic GI bleed.
He recieved 3 u PRBC on [**12-7**] and his hematocrit has been stable since then.
His blood pressure usually runs as low as SBP in mid 80s with heart rate in 70s without symptoms.
EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on [**12-11**] showed mass with stricture in second part of the duodenum, biopsy shows small intestinal mucusa.
He also has polyps and thickened fold in sigmoid colon and biopsy showed adenoma/hyperplasia.
Patient underwent another colonoscopy on [**12-19**] for polypectomy priot to discharge as the initial procedure was focussed on finding a source of bleed.
Serum tox was negative on admission.
You recieved blood transfusion and your blood levels increased after that.
