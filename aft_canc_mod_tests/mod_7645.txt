CT torso, CT neck showed esophageal perforation, active contrast extravasation into parenchyma of RLL lung, which has multiple loculated fluid collections including one 11x7x10cm, bilateral simple pleural effusions, simple fluid in the pelvis, also 2x1x1 cm cystic mass on pancreas.
Patient made NPO and transferred to MICU [**Location (un) **]/[**Hospital Ward Name 517**] for a rigid and flexible bronchoscopy by IP with therapeutic aspiration of tracheobronchial secretions and diagnostic upper GI endoscopy without identification of fistula.
Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], ERCP team performed an EGD which showed an extensive ulcerated mass from 29 cm to 41 cm and narrowed lumen.
A 15cm by 18mm UltraFlex partially covered metal stent was placed successfully over the wire and barium esophogram showed showed patency of the stent.
Blood pressure was fluid responsive in the ICU and required no pressors.
However, given CT chest findings with concern for necrotic abscess and esophageal perforation, his abx were broadended initially to Zosyn/Levofloxacin, then to unasyn/bactrim.
# Necrotic right lung abscess: CT torso showed a large necrotic mass with extravasation of oral contrast, suggestive of esophageal perforation.
Culture from abscess revealing thin branching G+ rods and G+ cocci in pairs and chains, no nocardia.
CXR the day after rigid bronch showed collapsed RLL.
After ERCP, patient was still intubated so prior to extubation, patient underwent repeat bronch with mucous pluggings removed.
Patient is to have repeat imaging on [**2-3**] and should have follow up with ID for eval of progression/resolution of abscess.
He underwent CT neck/chest that showed esophageal-pulmonary fistula (see above), which has been stented.
Patient then underwent a PET CT for staging which did not show any diffuse metastatic disease.
- Monitor LFT's  To recap, The patient was transferred to the MICU for rigid bronch on [**1-8**] for evaluation of a lung abscess and was started on IV clindamycin, and back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for esophageal stent [**1-9**] for an esophageal fistula, and then transferred to the OMED service for further oncologic workup and therapy.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
The patient had a repeat CT scan of his chest on [**1-31**] which showed improvement of his abscess, ?
Labwork showed ESR 86 and CRP 117.5.
The patient's INR was 2.6 on [**2-2**] after 2 doses of 5mg warfarin, so the [**2-2**] and [**2-3**] doses were held.
The patient was restarted on coumadin 2.5mg daily on [**2-4**] and [**2-5**] with a d/c INR of 2.4.
He should continue coumadin for at least 6 months with a goal INR of [**1-27**].
Extensive instructions were given to the patient both verbally and written, but it is difficult to know how compliant the patient and his son-in-law will be with medications and attending followup appointments.
