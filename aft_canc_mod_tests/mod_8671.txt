Mild increase compared to the most recent study of [**2149-8-30**], performed at OSH.
Followup evaluation after resolution of the hematoma can be considered for better assessment.
Associated another DVA in the region of the hematoma cannot be completley excluded based on the findings on MRI performed subsequently.
This can be correlated with direct visualization in the ENT examination to exclude any associated focal lesion and if necessary, MRI, as the left palatine tonsil is bulkier than the right (series 3, image 10).
