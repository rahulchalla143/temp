He was taken by EMS to the ER at which point his O2 sat was 88% and he was placed on a NRB.
Upon arrival to the ED his vitals were T 98.9, HR 67, BP 116/62, RR 20, O2 sat 96% on NRB, and while there failed a trial on nasal cannula and placed on 70% cool mist mask.
ABG revealed:7.40/51/135 on NRB, and CXR showed RLL opacity suspicious for pneumonia.
Stat CT Head showed no evidence of bleed.
Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI Brain and C-spine +/- gadolinium to eval for mets once respiratory status stabilized (not emergent) as well as EEG.

Non-contrast Head CT: multiple prior lacunar infarctions, age related atrophy with widened ventricles, no hemorrhage or mass effect.
The causes of his hypercarbia were felt to be irreversible - advance lung CA-, and he was changed to comfort measures only.
An echo to evaluated for structural heart abnormalities or vegetations was attempted but the patient was too agitated to tolerate the study.
On Chest CT , he was found to have large pelural mass (consistent with known Lung CA) and a possible post-obstructive pneumonia.
In addition, the CT showed segmental RML PE.
LE U/S showed left femoral DVT.
CTA also showed advanced interstitial lung disease on CTA - the patient has a known extensive history of asbestos exposure and 100 pack year smoking history.
MRI of the head showed no metastasis making him lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage.
Head CT noted multiple non-specific lesions.
An MRI/MRA was performed which showed multifocal left cerebral acute infarction.
An echo to evaluate for endocarditis was attempted but the patient was too agitiated to tolerate it.
The patient also received a speech and swallow evaluation which showed significant dysphagia and aspiration.
His GI bleed was presumed to be due to hemrrhoids.
# Lung cancer/ Head & Neck Cancer: The patient has know extensive disease, confirmed by Chest CT and Head MRI.
Head MRI found multiple areas of infarction but no overt metastasis.
# LFT elevations: Initially, he was found to have mild LFT elevations with AST 98 and ALT 45 of unclear etiology.
Given that he was found down over 24h, his CK was elevated due to mild rhabdomyolysis.
He was given fluids and his CK's trended down.
