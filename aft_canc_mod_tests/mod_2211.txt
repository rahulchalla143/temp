She was brought to [**Hospital3 7569**] where a CT head was performed and it was questioned the presence of a brain aneurysm as which point she was transferred.
Here MRI was notable for mild periventricular white matter changes as well as an apparent acute left thalamocapsular infarct.
CTA of the head confirmed a 5mm left MCA aneurysm.
All other ROS were negative in detail.

Left MCA bifurcating aneurysm, better evaluated on the previously performed CTA.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2104-7-7**] at 3:44:23 PM      FINAL IMPRESSION: Very small fluttering echodensity on the right coronary leaflet as described above c/w possible fibroelastoma or fibrin strand.
If clinically indicated, a TEE is suggested to better define the aortic valve abnormality.
THALAMIC INFARCT LIKELY DUE TO A CARDIOEMBOLIC EVENT;  MCA ANEURYSM: Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient's exam was notable for mild righ facial [**Last Name (un) **]-labial effacement with weakness on the right in an upper motor neuron fashion more proximally than distally, and decreased sensation to pinprick on the right arm and leg.
Her head CT showed normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation but did show a 5mm left MCA aneurysm.
POSSIBLE FIBROELASTOMA: Echocardiogram was performed the in evaluation of the patient's stroke.
Cardiology and CT Surgery felt that additional testing (TEE) would not be beneficial at this time, and recommended a repeat ECHO in 3 months to reassess this growth.
It was felt that conservative medical management, optimization of BP control, and a repeat MRA in [**7-23**] months are appropriate for the timebeing.
Her neurologic exam was notable for a mild right arm pronator drift and a narrow based gait with shortened stride.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation of right leg weakness and a aneurysm found on your brain.
Because of this, we have started you on two new medications: Lisinopril: 5mg daily (for blood pressure control) Atorvastatin: 40mg daily (for cholesterol control)  In addition, you should take the medication Plavix, which is a blood thinner, to prevent future strokes.
