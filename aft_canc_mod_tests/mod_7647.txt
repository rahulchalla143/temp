Brain MRI [**2114-12-29**] at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital Numerous foci of signal abnormality on subcortical white matter with abnormal enhancement.
Abdominal US [**1-3**]: 1.
If there is suspicion for underlying malignancy or risk factors for primary liver lesions, these lesions can be further evaluated with multiphasic CT or hepatic MR. 3.
CT Torso [**1-4**]: 1.
Chest x-ray [**1-5**]: There is progression of left lower lobe consolidation concerning for progression of left lower lobe pneumonia.
Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.

Sacralization of L5 with rudimentary disk at L5-S1.
These results, in combination with the finding of a thyroid nodule noted on imaging studies, strongly suggest metastatic medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, although, metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma from other primary sites are less likely possibilities.

# Altered mental status: Initially, differential was quite broad including bacterial vs. viral vs. tick borne infection, TTP, organic brain disease, toxins.
Patient's serum tox tests were negative.
TSH and B12 were normal.
Blood cryptococcal Ag, RPR, [**Month (only) **] all negative.
[**1-3**] parasite smear negative x 1, anaplasma, Babesia, Leptospira aso negative and serum HSV, RPR, HIV also neg.
MRI at OSH showed some white matter changes which were non specific.
Repeat MRI brain [**1-10**] with no process to account of AMS.
During the admission, neuro-onc evaluated the patient and reviewed the imaging.
Neuro onc suggested that the 2 small lesions on MRI could actually represent foci of metastatic disease and may also account for the altered mental status.
However, biopsy was deferred given risk of the procedure and XRT was deferred as well.
In setting of standing Haldol, had repeat ECGs, last one on [**1-18**] with QTc of 440. .
# Medullary Thyroid Cancer: Bone marrow biopsy initially with carcinoma, further tests confirmed medullary thyroid cancer.
CT torso with pathologic fracture at T12, but no clear primary.
MRI spine showed diffuse bone marrow metastases but ruled out spinal cord compression.
MRI brain with no mass at OSH.
Repeat MRI at [**Hospital1 18**] showed nonspecific changes as well as 2 nondescript lesions.
Had biopsy [**1-15**] which confirmed medullary thyroid cancer.
Given association of MEN syndromes with medullary thyroid, will consulted endocrine  who recommended testing for plasma metanephrines to rule out pheochromocytoma, but no further testing as patient does not have any children.
Checked daily CBCs and tranfused platelets if <10 or actively bleeding and pRBCs if hct <25.
LDH concerning for myelodysplastic process though uric acid normal.
Abdominal imaging with several hypodense lesions in the liver consistent with hemangiomas.
You underwent bone marrow biopsy as well, which showed that you have cancer.
An MRI of the spine showed that you have a fracture from the cancer but it is not compressing the spinal cord.
MRI of the brain showed that you have cancer involvement of the brain as well.
