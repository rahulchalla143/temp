Of note, chest CT had also been performed and was negative for PE.
Induced sputum cultures returned negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] continuation of bactrim was not felt indicated per ID recommendations.
Serial ABG's showed persistent PaO2's >50% (after initial PaO2 of 44%) with stable CO2 ranging from 42-48 and pH ranging from 7.40-7.47.
Repeat CXR at this time showed worsening multi-focal pneumonia.
However, his CXR still seemed out of proportion to his clinical status.
Unfortunately all sputum cultures had returned negative, so we were unable to tailor therapy appropriately.
He continued to improve on the [**Month/Day (4) 3242**] floor, with diuresis progressing successfully with lasix prn, and with O2 requirement improving despite a lack of radiologic improvement on repeat CT scan.
# Coag Negative Staph UTI/Bacteremia - Mr. [**Known lastname 34834**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1801**] presented with fever and neutropenia, with positive urine and blood cultures for coagulase negative staph.
His last positive blood culture was from [**4-10**] and all subsequent blood cultures remained negative.
Trans-thoracic ECHO was performed and showed no vegitations.
PICC line was subsequently placed for access once blood cultures were negative for greater than 48 hours.
This was felt likely secondary to volume depletion in the setting of low blood pressures in the 90-100 systolics and recent auto-diuresis of 2 liters over the previous day.
In addition, he was given 2 units of pRBCs for his anemia, which also could have been precipitating his tachycardia.
His counts were monitored daily.
