Her O2 sat was noted to be 86 on RA, improving to 95 on 3L NC.
Blood cultures and flu swab were obtained and she was referred to the ED.
A CT of the chest was ordered looking for possible PCP and showed evidence of infection with multifocal airspace opacities.
Her recent vitals (prior to intubation) show RR 32, HR 124, 127/83 and O2 sat of 76,RA -> 96,3L.

Pertinent Results: Admission Labs:  [**2114-11-9**] 01:37PM   LACTATE-1.5 [**2114-11-9**] 09:15AM   GLUCOSE-156* UREA N-17 CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-3.8 CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-17 [**2114-11-9**] 09:15AM   ALT(SGPT)-24 AST(SGOT)-27 LD(LDH)-349* ALK PHOS-189* TOT BILI-0.8 [**2114-11-9**] 09:15AM   WBC-13.5* RBC-2.96* HGB-10.0* HCT-29.7* MCV-101* MCH-33.8* MCHC-33.6 RDW-13.9 [**2114-11-9**] 09:15AM   NEUTS-68.1 LYMPHS-17.8* MONOS-13.3* EOS-0.5 BASOS-0.3  Discharge Labs:  Radiology: CT Chest w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: New-onset airspace opacification with air bronchograms of the right upper lobes, lower lobes and middle portion of the right middle lobe with patchy diffusely distributed opacification in the left lung with an associated right pleural effusion, suggests the possibility of an infectious process, such as multifocal bacterial pneumonia.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza was negative, and flu cultures were negative.
Sputum cultures did not show any bacteria.
Cardiac causes of respiratory failure were considered, but a TTE showed hyperdynamic function with LVEF> 55%, mild pulm htn, trivial pericardial effusion, and no valvular disease, so this was not likely to cause a compromise in respiratory function.
On [**11-29**], the patient became hypotensive with SBP in 70s.
Got stat CXR which showed large left pneumothorax.
Chest tube was immediately placed with vital signs improved immediately upon chest tube placement.
EGD was performed at bedside which revealed massive amounts of clotted blood in the fundus of the stomach, but no clear eveidence of active bleed.
# Septic shock: The patient was hypotensive requiring levophed and vasopressin initially, likely due to septic shock secondary to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest.
The urine legionella antigen was negative, and the patient did not grow any bacteria from her urine or blood cultures.
Serum beta-glucan and beta-galactomannan were negative on multple occasions.
Her urine output at times was low likely due to hypotension and a component of ATN.
Urine output picked up successfully with fluids and increases in blood pressure.
# Anemia: The patient intermittently needed blood transfusions due to low Hematocrits.
Her anemia is likely due to her CA, anemia of chronic inflammation and the daily blood draws that were needed during her ICU course.
A hep B viral load was sent [**11-15**] and no DNA could be detected.
