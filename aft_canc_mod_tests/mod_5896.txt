Rectal exam revelaed normal tone; normal LE strength; no neuro deficits on exam.
Per renal c/s: admit to ICU; give hypertonic saline 20/hr 3% w/Q2 hr Na checks max 30/hr of saline goal Na 121, delta/hour <1meq if overshoots give D5W and DDAVP.
If albumin check Na Q2H b/c may shut down ADH and dilute urine w/acute change in Na.
150 cc of turbid urine came out the foley.Per hepatology, repeat Na, vs this admit to ICU vs floor (Dr [**Name (NI) **]).
Albumin was 2.2, lipase was 56.
Chem 7 was Na 113, K 4.3 Cl 88* HCO3 20* Anion gap 9 BUN 15 Cr 0.8.
Her serum osmolality was 253.
Pt, PTT, INR of 21.1*/64.1*1/1.9*.
UA was unremarkable, Urine cultures were sent.
Bedside abdominal US revealed a ?distended bladder which was difficult to differentiate from surrounding ascites; moderate hydronephrosis on R, L kidney poorly visualized.
ED CT Abdomen and Pelvis w/o contrast: Bladder collapsed around Foley catheter and not optimally evaluated.
On arrival to the MICU, vital signs were stable.

MRI head [**2121-12-17**]:  1.
An MRI of the sella and MRA of the brain are recommended for further evaluation.
MRA brain/MRI sella:  1.
Although the prior outside studies are not available for comparison, the cystic lesion described on the previous study in the region of hypothalamus appears to be due to a prominent perivascular space, due to indentation in the region of hypothalamus by basilar artery tip.
MRA of the head demonstrates no evidence of aneurysm or vascular malformation.
CT abd/pelvis without contrast [**2121-12-31**]: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 60F w h/o cirrhosis, [**3-12**] PBC and autoimmune hepatitis, c/b HCC and diuretic resistant ascites, on transplant list, admitted with weakness and increasing ascites and found to have hyponatremia.
She was admitted to the ICU with sodium of 113.
Tolvaptan was stopped and salt tabs were given with sodium stable  Hematocrit had dropped from 25 to 20, requiring [**2-9**] units of PRBCs.
EGD and colonoscopy showed no evidence of active bleed.
Capsule endoscopy was positive for active bleed in the duodenal bulb.
An active type and cross was maintained throughout admission and hematocrit was monitored closely.
Urine was positive for vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus [**12-23**].
Subsequent urine cultures grew yeast ([**Female First Name (un) **] albicans).
She received a large contrast load, and underwent a 6L paracentesis.
Liver duplex was wnl.
Urine output increased slowly to 1000cc/day.
Creatinine decreased to 1.3.
Potassium increased to 5.6.
Of note, LFTs were significant for slowly rising alk phos which was 52 po postop day 1.
This increased daily to 310 on [**1-18**] when all LFTs were increased (alt 164, ast 164, alk phos 234 and t.bili 2.8 from 97, 26, 87 and 1.6 respectively).
Liver duplex was done noting patient vasculature with normal waveforms.
Glucoses 150-200 range.
Weight on [**1-23**] was 81.5kg.
While the patient was in-house, she underwent repeat imaging of her brain for 6-month follow-up (MRI brain/MRI sella/MRA brain).
