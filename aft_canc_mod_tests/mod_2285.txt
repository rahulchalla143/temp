PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed alert and oriented, in no apparent distress.
Temperature was 98.4, blood pressure was 142/74, heart rate was 78, respiratory rate was 17, oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination was within normal limits.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Pulmonary examination revealed clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Chest examination revealed the site of prior mastectomy.
Her postoperative hematocrit was 34.2 with a white blood cell count of 11.
Given the symptoms of nausea, a KUB of the abdomen was obtained which showed diffuse dilatation of the small bowel and colon; consistent with postoperative ileus.
On postoperative day three, the patient was noted to be hypotensive, and she was noted to have her hematocrit decrease from 36 to 21.2.
The patient was quickly taken to the operating room on [**2160-10-19**] for exploratory laparotomy and evaluation of the bleed.
Several liters of blood were aspirated from the abdomen.
Before the exploratory laparotomy, she was found to have an INR of 4.3.
Her hematocrit was increased with several transfusions.
Her urine output remained adequate.
Several blood cultures were taken which showed no growth.
An electrocardiogram performed at the time showed a sinus rhythm, and no change compared to the baseline tracing available.
Cultures were obtained from the fluid which showed no microorganisms; only polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
In addition, the white blood cell count in the fluid was low and not suggestive of any infection.
The patient also had several urine cultures obtained which grew Escherichia coli as well as Corynebacterium species.
As perviously mentioned, her blood cultures grew nothing.
Her hematocrit remained stable; although, she continued to be anemic, and at some point required more blood.
In addition, the CAT scan that was obtained on [**2160-10-25**] showed evidence of portal vein thrombosis which was confirmed by the ultrasound.
The patient's creatinine did increase slightly but then returned back to the patient's baseline of approximately 1.5.
She appeared to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate of approximately 35,  but her blood pressure and heart rate were stable, and her oxygen levels remained the same.
A arterial blood gas was obtained at that time which showed a pH of 7.53, PO2 of 75, and PCO2 of 19, with a base excess of -3, and total CO2 of 16.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes, and her lung scan was low probability of any pulmonary embolism.
Her electrocardiogram showed no changes.
However, the chest x-ray did show left lower lobe consolidation.
She continued to be coagulopathic with an INR of 2.6 on [**2160-10-30**].
She was also noted to have a white blood cell count of 48 and a platelet count of approximately 2 million.
Her liver function tests were elevated; consistent with portal vein thrombosis seen on the CAT scan and ultrasound.
Her white blood cell count and platelet count decreased slowly with this medication.
While on Hydroxyurea, the patient's white blood cell count decreased significantly and was noted to be 0.4 several days later.
Her liver function tests improved and were essentially normal.
While the patient was on neutropenic precautions; secondary to a low white blood cell count, she was maintained on cefepime intravenously which was discontinued when the neutropenic precautions were removed.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  Her laboratories upon discharge were as follows:  White blood cell count was 7.9 and hematocrit was 27.8 (differential with 70% neutrophils), platelet count was 389.
INR was 2.2.
The patient was to take 2.5 mg of Coumadin q.d., and she was to see her primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44936**] in approximately two to three days for an INR check and any adjustment of Coumadin.
