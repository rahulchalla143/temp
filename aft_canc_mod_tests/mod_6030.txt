PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 130/77.
Heart rate 96.
Temperature 98.
Respiratory rate 16, 02 saturation 98%.
Release testing reveals left greater that right palmomental reflex, normal jaw jerk, no rooting, slight grasp bilaterally.
Motor strength testing reveals generally 4+/5 in the upper extremities and anywhere from 0-3 in the lower extremities.
On sensory exam, light touch is decreased in the feet bilaterally.
Repeated testing does not show any clear finding.
Pinprick and temperature is decreased in the feet symmetrically.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram [**2107**]:  Atrial fibrillation, nonspecific ST changes.
Laboratories from [**8-9**]:  CBC:  White blood cell count 13.9, hematocrit 34 and CB 115, platelets 110.
INR 2.4, CK 171.
CT of the thoracolumbar spine done on [**8-21**] showed T12, L1, L4-L5 compression fractures with retrolisthesis of L3 and L4 and L4 on L5 and a calcified mass on the tail of the pancreas.
CT of abdomen [**8-22**] with contrast showed a 4 x 8 x 5. cm mass in the tail of the pancreas and several tiny nodules in lung bases, left greater with right with patchy linear opacities in right base.
Bone scan on [**8-23**] showed increased foci in the lower lumbar spine and right iliac ring suspicious for metastatic disease.
MRI of lumbar spine showed mass in the lumbo-sacral region.
A myelogram was ordered initially, but could not be done because the patient refused the myelogram on the first day and subsequently had abnormally high INR.
On the day that the myelogram was scheduled for, he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit after a respiratory arrest on [**8-25**] and intubated.
Bronchoscopy at that time showed significant aspirated material.
He was initially started on dexamethasone for presumed cord compression on [**8-25**] and family ultimately declined transfer to [**Hospital6 1708**] for CT myelogram.
It should be noted that the patient was unable to tolerate an MRI secondary to his scoliosis.
Ultimately, patient did receive a CT myelogram which showed obstruction to flow of contrast from below at T8 and T9 level.
CT guided biopsy which was done on [**2113-8-29**].
Ultimately, his biopsy of his sacral lesions was consistent with malignancy, likely adenocarcinoma.
