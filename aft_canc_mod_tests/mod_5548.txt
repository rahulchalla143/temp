ECHO [**2161-2-25**] Conclusions: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
With this method pt had residuals of 100 and was requesting use of pump.
# Pericardial effusion: Pt had a small pericardial effusion seen on recent CT scan.
CXR showed small bilateral effusion with pulmonary edema.
Her SOB and O2 requirement continued to worsen.
Repeat CXR now showed moderate szized effusion on the left with increase size of silhoutte of heart.
Pulsus was 15 at this time.
She was then sent for ECHO which demonstrated large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Follow up ECHOs showed no evidence of reacculmulation 5 days later.
# ARF: Pt presented with creatinine of 2.8 and BUN of 77.
Her baseline creatinine was 0.8.
Blood cultures and UA thus far negaitve.
