A CT head was performed at [**Hospital1 1562**] which showed right encephalomalacia, and volume loss, no midline shift or ICH.
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
on [**2117-12-23**] (2) Cyberknife radiosurgery to the 1-right frontal lobe resection cavity to 2400 cGy (800 cGy x 3 fractions) at 84% isodose line from [**2118-1-26**] to [**2118-1-28**] (3) lumbar puncture on [**2118-6-23**] showed 0 WBC, 31 protein, and negative cytology for malignant cells (4) status post Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2118-7-6**] at 2-right frontal metastasis to [**2108**] cGy at 70% isodose line and 3-left frontal metastasis to 2200 cGy at 77% isodose line.
She underwent a thallium-SPECT today and the official result is pending.
A mammogram showed suspicious breast tumor.
The pathology showed ER positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
She was well until [**2112**] when she developed a cough and a chest X-ray showed a shadow.
Biopsy showed adenocarcinoma that was ER positive, PR negative, HER-2 negative by FISH.
A right upper lobe transbronchial biopsy on [**2115-6-26**] showed adenocarcinoma, and her treatment was switched to Xeloda on [**2115-12-18**].
Her neurological problem began in later [**Name (NI) **] and early [**2117-12-7**], with pounding [**Hospital1 **]-frontal headaches that radiated to the occiput.
A gadolinium-enhanced head MRI on [**2117-12-21**] showed a right frontal enhancing mass with surrounding cerebral edema, mass effect, and 2 mm of midline shift.
The pathology was ER positive metastatic breast carcinoma.
MRI Brain Functional [**2119-5-18**]:  Functional MRI of the brain, demonstrating the expected activation areas for the primary motor cortex during the movement of the hands and feet and also during the movement of the tongue, no significant areas of BOLD activation are demonstrated adjacent to the right opercular mass lesion.
[**2119-5-19**] MRI brain There are stable post-surgical changes at the right frontoparietal region, the anterior right frontal lesion again measures 12 x 17 mm and the second right posterior frontal lesion is also stable in size and involves the adjacent dura.
CT head [**2119-5-19**] Expected postoperative changes following right frontal craniotomy for right frontal and parietal lesions  MRI brain [**2119-5-20**] Postoperative changes are seen in the right side of the scalp.
There is a possible small focus of infarction in the right posterolateral frontal lobe, although this conceivably could be artifact from blood products.
Leptomeningeal enhancement in the right frontal lobe is likely to be post-surgical, and there is mild midline shift to the left for a few millimeters which is unchanged.
She underwent MR Spectroscopy on [**5-15**] which showed "Interval progression in the pattern of enhancement at the right temporal frontoparietal lesion with avid perfusion and increased signal on the corresponding ASL sequence, concerning for tumor progression, there is also mild increase in vasogenic edema extending at the external capsule".
A functional MRI was obtained preoperatively which showed no motor involvement of right frontal tumor.
A CT and subsequent MRI demonstrated no acute hemorrhage.

You went for an MRI to address your brain metastases which suggested possible tumor progression.
