Given elevated AFP (4093 on [**7-23**]) and biopsy of undifferentiated carcinoma, patient was treated for germ cell tumor with neoadjuvant cisplatin and etoposide from [**Date range (1) 73635**].
From an ID perspective, following cycle 1 of chemotherapy, patient was diagnosed with a VAP on [**7-28**] and was started on vanco and cefepime.
Cefepime was changed to Zosyn when patient's sputum culture was (+) for Achromobacter on [**8-7**].
C diff was negative x 3 and was thought to be secondary to chemotherapy.
A CT scan was obtained on [**9-15**] showing ileocecal thickening and ?

DR. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16277**]  CT Chest [**2171-9-18**] - PRIOR to stent placement: Final Report CT CHEST REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of patient with known anterior mediastinal germ-cell tumor.
TECHNIQUE:  Unenhanced MDCT of the chest from thoracic inlet to upper abdomen was obtained with subsequent 1.25 and 5 mm collimation axial images reviewed in conjunction with coronal reformat.
Just below the ET tube tip the tracheal diameter is 6 x 12 mm with the area of 75 cm2.
CT Chest [**2171-9-18**] - s/p stenting: Final Report CT CHEST REASON FOR EXAM:  S/P placement of airway stent.
Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day in the morning.
- Check baseline CXR - cont AC support pending stent placement - sedation with fentanyl, midazolam - albuterol/atrovent MDIs .
- cont cefepime, amikacin - check baseline CXR as above .
- vanco for staph on Quinton tip - cefepime, amikacin for pseudomonas - caspofungin for empiric fungal coverage - pan-culture if spikes - ID consult if patient remains in house after tomorrow .
# pancytopenia: Hct and platelets reportedly stable from OSH recs.
- cont flagyl - cont NPO - consider checking C diff toxin B .
C diff negative x 3 at OSH.
- check EKG - cont metoprolol.
Can increase prn as BP will tolerate - treat pain with methadone, fentanyl gtt .
