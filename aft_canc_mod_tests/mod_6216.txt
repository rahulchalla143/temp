CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2194-3-2**] 10:19 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
Note that non-contrast CT is less sensitive for detection of small parenchymal metastases in comparison with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2194-3-6**] 9:57 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
A Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
MR brain showed irregularity of the right distal vertebral artery with focal outpouching could represent focal aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm or area of dissection.
GU: The patient had a Foley catheter, and her urine output was routinely monitored Heme: The patient's cbc was routinely monitored ID: The patient was put on vancomycin, zosyn, clindamycin, fluconazole for necrotizing fasciitis as well as a perineal yeast infection in close proximity to her wound.
Multiple cultures were obtained, and ID was consulted for further evaluation.
She initially had clinical deterioration on Zosyn and culture + for E. fergisonii and group B strep.
Her infection is likely mixed aerobic / anaerobic and it is unclear that previous culture results represent all pathogenic organisms.
