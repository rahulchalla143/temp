In [**9-11**] she was treated with rituximab and her ITP seemed to respond.
However, CT guided biopsy in [**2-11**] was w/o evidence of malignancy.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 498**] for an extensive workup.
Initial thought was that she had MS, given white matter changes on an MRI in [**Month (only) 116**], but the diagnosis was not definite.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] felt at that time that her exam and history were most consistent with PML.
Evaluation at that time was notable for: WBC of 15.5, 93% neutrophils, Hct 28.7, MCV 91, plts of 448, Cr of 0.7, TSH of 0.50, neg HIV, neg EBV and [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus PCR in CSF, negative viral/fungal/cryptococcal Ag in CSF.
LP: cell count 1 WBC, 4 RBC, 3% polys, 70% lymphs, 27% monos, TP 28, glu 68.
Physical Exam: Temp 99 BP 104/62 Pulse 103 Resp 18 O2 sat 99% ra Gen - Alert, oriented x3, no acute distress HEENT - anicteric, mucous membranes slightly dry Neck - no JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest - Clear to auscultation bilaterally CV - Normal S1/S2, RRR, systolic murmur heard best at the LLSB Abd - Soft, nontender, nondistended, with normoactive bowel sounds Extr - No edema.

MRI scan of the head [**2108-4-15**] reviewed today.
Diffusion weighted studies appear normal with no evidence of hemorrhage.
MRI scan of the spine [**2108-4-15**] shows no intramedullary signal changes.
CT torso [**2108-6-2**] INDICATION: History of cognitive decline, history of liver nodules concerning for metastatic disease on outside hospital imaging.
TECHNIQUE: Axial volumetric images have been obtained through the abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast.
Arterial, portal venous, and delayed venous phases were also obtained after administration of IV contrast.
----------------- [**2108-6-3**] MR of thoracic and cervical spine MRI SCAN OF THE CERVICAL AND THORACIC SPINE  CONCLUSION:  Relatively minor changes of cervical spondylosis, and a small T2-3 disc protrusion.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm is not well seen.
ultra sound liver biopsy [**2108-6-5**] TARGETED ULTRASOUND-GUIDED LIVER BIOPSY: A limited ultrasound examination of the liver was performed, demonstrating numerous lobulated hypoechoic masses within the liver, consistent with lymphoma.
CT chest [**2108-6-5**] INDICATION: Mental status change and liver nodules.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images through the chest were obtained without intravenous contrast and displayed at 5 and 1.25 mm of collimation.
A set of sagittal and coronal images were reformatted for review.
CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: When compared to the prior CT abdomen of [**2108-6-2**], small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, have increased in size.
While not tailored for infradiaphragmatic evaluation, multiple liver hypodensities concerning for metastases are best characterized on the recent CT abdomen scan.
Shoulder xray [**2108-6-6**] HISTORY: Lytic humeral lesion seen on CT showing liver disease.
Comparison is made to report from prior examination dated [**2108-6-4**].
OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW STUDY  Prior to the initiation of the study, the patient had an episode of seizure beginning with tonic stiffening of the upper extremities and slight rightward deviation of the head for approximately 30 seconds followed by generalized clonic activity of both upper and lower extremities, which lasted approximately 1-1/2 minutes.
Patient's hemodynamic parameters remained stable, and a blood sugar of over 100 was noted.
IMPRESSION:  Unsuccessful swallow study due to seizure.
[**2108-6-11**] cxr HISTORY: Aspiration pneumonia.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-9**], there is increased opacification at the right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with aspiration involving the right middle lobe.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-9**], there is increased opacification at the right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with aspiration involving the right middle lobe.
CXR [**2108-6-13**] FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which is appropriately positioned.
No interval change in degree of mild diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, which is a non-specific finding and may be related to previous lumbar punctures, this appearance is not typical of lymphoma or PML.
Right frontal lobe, biopsy (B):  Cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with minimal changes, see note.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2108-6-9**] the rate has increased.

COMPARISON: MRI from [**2108-6-15**] and CT from [**2108-6-11**].
ECHO [**2108-6-18**] Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Final internal length is 51 cm, with the tip positioned in the SVC.
[**2108-6-21**] cxr FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-20**], there is again a diffuse infiltrate of pulmonary process presenting as marked prominence of the interstitial markings.
[**2108-6-28**] chest CT with contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2108-6-29**] echo IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Compared to prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-6-18**], the regional left ventricular dysfunction cannot be assessed on the current study.
Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, unchanged compared to the preoperative study of [**2108-6-15**], which is of uncertain etiology but unlikely to be related to lymphoma.
CT Head with contrast [**2108-7-3**] IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2108-7-5**] CT torso with constrast  IMPRESSION:  1.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

She has a past history of Hodgkin's' lymphoma in [**2092**] now with recurrence and was admitted for diagnostic work-up of cognitive decline.
She then had a brain bx which did not show any pathology.
# Hodgkin's lymphoma - on [**6-2**] she had a abdominal CT that showed innumerable liver nodules.
She has a ultra sound guided liver biopsy on [**6-5**], and the patient was found to have a recurrence of HD.
Her LP on [**6-6**] and brain bx on [**6-16**] was negative for CNS involvement.
Her WBC nadir was on [**7-1**] at 1.1 and her ANC nadir was on [**7-5**] at 1312.
Therefore, she was restarted on chemotherapy with Doxil 17mg, Vinorelbine 26mg, and Gemcitabine 1400mg, Decadron 20mg on [**2108-7-13**], and will need her next treatment in [**5-15**] days after discharge depending on her nadir.
She will also likely need treatment with G-CSF as her ANC falls on [**7-16**] and [**7-17**].
# Seizure - Just prior to a video swallowing exam on [**2108-6-11**], the patient was observed to have a tonic clonic seizure lasting approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute.
She had post-ictal confusion, no fecal or urinary incontinence, and her vital signs were stable during and after her seizure.
She had an EEG on [**7-5**] that only showed diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy consistent with her paraneoplastic syndrome.
She went to the ICU in setting of hypoxia from 714/-[**6-20**] after her brain bx.
Then after her last CT scan on [**7-5**] showed bilateral increased pleural effusions (worse on left) and bilaterally lower lobe consolidations she was switched to vancomycin and aztreonam.
The brain biopsy was on [**6-16**] and was inconsistent with lymphoma or PML.
While in the ICU, head imaging showed edema around her biopsy site that was concerning for infection, but MRI was not consistent with this.
Cultures, EBV PCR, and [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] Virus PCR from CSF were all negative.
HSV PCR was negative.
Then after improvement in her mental status, she had another video swallow test on [**2108-7-13**], which did not show aspiration.
Therefore she was restarted on pureeded solids and thickened liquids, she will need follow up swallow study with video in [**12-7**] weeks.
Aztreonam 1 gram Recon Soln [**Month/Year (2) **]: 500mg Recon Solns Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) for 6 days: started on [**2108-7-6**].
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea for 7 days.
You also had a brain biopsy which did not show cancer in your brain.
You also had problems with your blood pressure dropping when you stood up, this has been improved with medication.
Video Swallow study in [**12-7**] weeks, should be arranged by rehab facility.
