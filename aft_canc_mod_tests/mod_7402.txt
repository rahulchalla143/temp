Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination was unremarkable.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  In terms of her laboratories, her preoperative white blood cell count was 5.4, with a hematocrit of 33.4, and a platelet count of 166.
Her preoperative blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 48 and 3.4.
Her hematocrit postoperatively was below 30.
From a respiratory standpoint, as noted, the patient remained intubated in the immediate postoperative period.
The Nephrology Service was consulted after initial workup was somewhat unrevealing, and it was felt that she was experiencing acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency with some acute tubular necrosis.
In order to maximize her recovery, the goal was to keep her hematocrit at 30 or above.
Her renal insufficiency was, as noted, improving slowly, and her creatinine was 2.9 prior to discharge.
Prior to discharge, her hematocrit had, as noted, stabilized and was 29.
Her platelet count had drifted somewhat and was in the 70s.
