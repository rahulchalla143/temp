Patient presented for scheduled echocardiogram today and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
The pericardial effusion was noted on a CT chest performed [**2132-8-26**], at which time a 2cm spiculated mass was also noted in the RUL concerning for malignancy.
Patient presented to his PCP with these symptoms, and labs were significant for anemia, macrocytosis, thrombocytopenia and small IgG kappa and IgM kappa monoclonal proteins.
The hematologist ordered a CT chest/abd/pelvis to investigate for adenopathy and organomegaly, and the above findings were discovered.
Today after echocardiogram showed pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, patient was taken to cath lab for drainage.

TTE ([**2132-9-2**]): The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**2132-8-26**]): 2 cm spiculated mass right upper lobe extending normal margins worrisome for malignancy.
Pertinent labs/studies: Pericardial fluid cytology ([**2132-9-4**])- POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.

Preliminary read: trace to small effusion without evidence of tamponade  Discharge labs: WBC 10.1  Hgb 13.4  Hct 39.8 Plts 220 Na 140 K 4.4 Cl 100 HCO3 30 BUN 37 Cr 1.7 Glucose 120   Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo M with h/o HTN, HL, COPD with RUL lung mass and pericardial effusion recently noted on CT scan, presenting with pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology, s/p drainage of approximately 1L bloody fluid with malignant cells on cytology  # Pericardial effusion - Given findings on CT scan of lung mass and bloody fluid drained from pericardium, there was concern for a malignant effusion.
A pericardiocentesis was done with a pericardial drain placed for two days until fluid output slowed to a minimal level with a total of roughly 1L output from initial drainage plus drain output.
The drain was clamped and a TTE was done 24hrs later which showed no significant fluid reaccumulation and the drain was then pulled.
At the time of discharge, echocardiogram showed small to trace reaccumulation of fluid.
Patient had negative pulsus paradoxus on exam and JVP was not elevated.
Outpatient laboratories were concerning for a macrocytosis and IgG/IgM monoclonal gammopathy.
Due to suspicion for lung cancer, a brain MRI was done looking for metastatic disease.
Decision was made to hold off on a bronchoscopy until final results from the pericardial fluid and until a PET scan was obtained as an outpatient.
# HTN- Blood pressures were stable throughout pericardial drainage and continue to be lowish but stable on arrival to CCU.
Because of his lowish blood pressures, his home HCTZ dose was decreased to 25mg daily and his verapamil was stopped as it provides relatively little blood pressure control and their was no need for nodal blocking.
# COPD - Patient was wheezing on exam but without gross sputum production or fever.
# Gastritis - Continue home omeprazole  # Transitional Issues: - Discussion with patient of final MRI results - Discussion of patient with final pre-discharge ECHO results - Follow-up on final cytology/pathology from pericardial fluid - Outpatient PET Scan - Possible outpatient bronchoscopy if final cytology not diagnostic - Outpatient [**Location (un) 2274**] heme/onc f/u to discuss diagnosis and treatment - Continuing support for smoking cessation  Medications on Admission: - Verapamil SR 240mg po daily - Lisinopril 20mg po daily - Hydrochlorothiazide 50mg po daily - Aspirin 81mg po daily - Colchicine 0.6mg po daily - Allopurinol 200mg po daily - Albuterol INH 1-2puffs q4-6hrs PRN - Flutcasone 220mcg/INH 2puffs [**Hospital1 **] - Omeprazole 20mg po BID   Discharge Medications: 1. colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Your home medications were continued as prescribed with the exception of Verapamil and hydrochlorothiazide as your blood pressures were low.
