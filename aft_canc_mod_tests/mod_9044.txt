12 hours later after receiving roughly 500 cc of fluid and multiple nebulizers of Albuterol and Atrovent without relief, the patient suddenly became more tachypneic to 40 with 92 saturations dropping to the low 90s on 4 liters.
Diastolic dysfunction and congestive heart failure exacerbated by the frequent nebulizers of Albuterol, making her tachycardiac which has given her likely diastolic dysfunction, causing exacerbation of congestive heart failure.
She was initially treated with Solu-Medrol intravenously, Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and CPAP and then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
In the Intensive Care Unit she had pulmonary artery catheter placed which demonstrated an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 at peak and her cardiac output was 3.64 and cardiac index was roughly around 2.
She was diuresed several liters of fluid with improvement in her cardiac output and her cardiac index.
The patient was ruled out for an myocardial infarction and as previously mentioned had a peak creatinine kinase of 340 and a peak troponin of .8 but this was likely due to her congestive heart failure.
Her blood pressure was well controlled on ACE inhibitor, Diltiazem and the systolic pressures in the 110 to 140 range.
She had a white count that was elevated to 26 to 27.
Her blood sugar remains somewhat difficult to control due to the steroids in the Intensive Care Unit.
Diastolic dysfunction 4.
