They obtained a head ct which showed a left parietal hypodensity with some "vasogenic edema".

Torso CT [**2103-6-15**]: CT CHEST:  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes were noted.
CT ABDOMEN:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, and bowel loops are within normal limits.
CT PELVIS:  Foley catheter is noted in the bladder.
EEG [**2103-6-15**]: IMPRESSION: EEG most consistent with a moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.
Head CT [**2103-6-18**]: FINDINGS:  There is no  interval change in the extent of vasogenic edema involving the left frontal lobe compared to [**2103-6-14**].
EEG [**2103-6-19**]: IMPRESSION: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) over the entire left hemisphere and due to a slow and disorganized background.
lower extremity venous ultrasound [**2103-6-19**]: LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND (BILATERAL):  Grayscale, color, and Doppler images of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained.
Head MRI [**2103-6-20**]: IMPRESSION:  Enhancing left posterior frontal lobe mass with surrounding edema for stereotactic localization prior to surgery.
Head CT [**2103-6-22**]: FINDINGS:  Patient is status post resection of a left parietal mass.
Head MRI [**2103-6-24**]: FINDINGS:  Pre-contrast study reveals T1 hyperintensity within the left temporal tumor resection bed as well as along the contiguous convexity surface.
Following contrast infusion, there is minimal residual enhancement, although somewhat irregular in contour, around the margins of the resection site.
This enhancement, while potentially postoperative, may also represent residual tumor and obviously will require continuing followup examinations to determine which diagnosis is correct.
The differential for her lesion included a neoplasm, infection, or stroke (would be atypical).
A head CT w/contrast performed in the ED showed that the mass was contrast-enhancing which could be suggestive for tumor (primary or metastatic) vs abscess.
While intubated, she underwent a head MRI which showed rim-enhancing left posterior frontal lobe subcortical lesion with edema in the surrounding brain, and a torso CT, part of a metastatic work up.
An EEG showed no seizure activity.
Her urine output remained stable.
A head CT showed normal post operative changes, no acute unexpected bleeding.
A post op MRI w/gadolinium showed some postoperative blood and minimal residual contrast enhancement, although somewhat irregular in contour, around the margins of the resection site.
An MRI of the L-spine with gad is being scheduled at outpatient and will be followed up at her next [**Hospital **] clinic visit.
She ruled out for MI per serial cardiac enzymes.
An ECG showed NSR, no strain.
CXR showed evolving consolidation, with improvement on serial CXR.
Blood cultures remained negative and she remained afebrile.
Part of her Hct drop can be explained by the surgery an dilutionary effects of IVF as well as repeat phlebotomy.
If her Hct does not improved, further workup (including GI workup) is indicated.
Guiac stools was negative on the day of discharge.
FEN: A speech and swallow evaluation indicated that she was safe for a diet consisting of soft solids and nectar-thick liquids.
Upon transfer from the unit the patient had a hypernatremia that was corrected with free H2O boluses through her NGT.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1.
An MRI of the L-spine with gad will be scheduled as outpatient.
