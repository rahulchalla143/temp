She received 4500 LR and 3 units PRBCs intraoperatively for a 1500ml blood loss.
Final pathology is pending.
Post-operative course: HEME: The patient had a pre-operative HCT of 27, she received 2u PRBC's intraoperatively for a ~1500 ml blood loss.
On POD#1 she received an additional u PRBC for a HCT of 26.4.
An additional 1 u PRBC (for a total of 5 units) was given on POD #2 for a HCT of 28.9.
She had course breath sounds bilaterally and a chest X-ray performed on POD #1 showed fluid overload she was treated with Lasix.
Cardiovascular: Cardiac enzymes were checked post-operatively due to the intra-operative desaturations and she ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
An echo showed likely normal LV systolic function, trace aortic regurgitation, slightly thickened mitral valve with mild mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension.
Her urine ouput increased on POD #2 with administration of fluids and Lasix.
A urine analysis and culture were sent and found to be positive for yeast.
The LFT elevation was thought to be consistent with a brief hemolytic picture.
