One day prior to admission at the [**Hospital1 2177**], he was seen in Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic for a complaint of increasing lethargy and shortness of breath; a chest x-ray done at that time demonstrated a new left lung air/fluid level.
A bronchoscopy done [**2149-11-13**] at [**Hospital1 2177**] demonstrated blood in the trachea, minimal right-sided blood without active bleeding, and white, friable mucosa in the left main stem bronchus with narrowing of the lumen, significant enough to prevent passage of the bronchoscope; blood was seen distal to the obstruction.
On [**2149-11-14**], a bronchial artery angiogram was performed with a goal of embolizing the bleeding source.
On the night prior to transfer to the [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient had an additional 300 cc of hemoptysis with an associated drop in his systolic blood pressure to the 80s and was therefore started on a Dopamine drip.
Stage 3A nonsmall cell (squamous type) lung cancer diagnosed in [**2149-8-11**], status post Taxol/Carboplatin as above, status post radiation, status post bone scan [**2149-9-15**] (no metastases), pulmonary function tests with a FEV 1 of 1.0 (not a surgical candidate); 2.
F., his temperature maximum from earlier in the day was 102, heartrate 69 to 97, blood pressure 99 to 110/50 to 60, and mean blood pressure of 66 to 99.
He was on a mechanical ventilator set at assist control 350/20/0.50/5, and arterial blood gases done on those settings was 7.34/38/82.
His peak pressure was 20 and his plateau pressure was 14.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, his conjunctivae were clear, and his pupils were pinpoint.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were dopplerable, and there was no edema.
He had no skin rashes or lesions,  LABORATORY DATA:   Initial laboratory evaluation demonstrated a white blood cell count of 4.4, hematocrit of 34.8 and platelets of 237,000.
His INR was 1.4.
Initial serum chemistries demonstrated sodium 140, potassium 3.5, bicarbonate 21, chloride 111, BUN 6, creatinine 0.5 and glucose 126.
His calcium was 6.1, magnesium 1.7, phosphate 1.2 and ionized calcium 0.98.
A bronchoscopy done on admission demonstrated an oropharynx within normal limits; trachea deviated to the left but otherwise within normal limits; right airways within normal limits; left main stem bronchus obstructed by tumor versus clot, this area was suctioned, and argon beam coagulation destruction and airway debridement was performed.
The post procedure chest x-ray demonstrated some aeration of the left lung, right lower lobe effusion versus infiltrate.
An outside chest x-ray reportedly demonstrated left lung opacification and right lower lobe effusion versus infiltrate.
Hemoptysis - There was active bleeding seen at the time of initial bronchoscopy, of which the most likely source was the patient's malignancy.
His white blood cell count remained normal throughout his admission and he also remained afebrile throughout his admission.
Airway obstruction - The patient had a significant airway obstruction from his tumor that was largely relieved by the tumor destruction and airway debridement during the initial bronchoscopy as noted above; in addition, two stents were placed in an attempt to maintain airway patency.
A post procedural chest x-ray demonstrated increased aeration of the left lung, and breathsounds were heard over the left anterior chest wall following this initial procedure.
On hospital day #4, the patient underwent a second bronchoscopy, during which his proximal stent was repositioned 1.5 cm proximally.
He was successfully extubated on [**2149-11-18**], and remained on oxygen by nasal cannula ranging from 4 to 6 liters following his extubation.
His oxygen saturation remained between 94 and 98% on 4 to 6 liters of nasal cannula following his extubation.
He was gradually weaned off of the Dopamine drip during his hospitalization and he required no further blood transfusions, as his hematocrit remained above 30 throughout this hospitalization.
At the time of discharge, the patient's systolic blood pressure was stable in the 140s to 150s.
Blood loss anemia - The patient had a drop in his hematocrit following his hemoptysis at the outside hospital; following transfusion of 4 units of packed red cells at the outside hospital, the patient's hematocrit improved to 32.5.
Coagulopathy - The patient had a mild coagulopathy with an INR of 1.4 on admission.
Electrolyte abnormalities - The patient required repletion of his phosphate, potassium, magnesium, and calcium on multiple occasions throughout this admission.
Hemoptysis 3.
