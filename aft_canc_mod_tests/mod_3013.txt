HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old female with a pre-B cell ALL diagnosed in [**June 2125**] following a workup of diffuse myalgias and low-grade fevers.
ALL diagnosed in [**2125-6-3**] of the pre-B cell type with the translocation of 4:11 status post hyper-CVAD x3, status post APO induction.
Hepatitis B diagnosed in [**2117**], specific serology is unknown.
LABORATORY AND DATA POINTS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 18.6 compared to a baseline of 5.1 in [**2126-2-3**].
The hematocrit is 27.8, platelets 99.
Chem-7 is sodium 137, potassium 4.0, chloride 99, bicarb 25, BUN 10, creatinine 0.5, glucose 133.
The alkaline phosphatase is 96, total bilirubin 0.2, LDH 477.
The INR is 1.0.
Uric acid 6.4.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrates persistent acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
On the day of stem cell transplant, the patient had an ANC of 50 with a uric acid level of 1.8 at that time.
She received methotrexate on days 0, 3, 6, and 11 with the dose on day 0 being 30 mg and the dose on the rest of the days being 20 mg.  At the time of dictation on day plus 9, the patient was still neutropenic with an ANC of 20.
She appeared to be developing a slight rash on her shoulders, which could be suggestive of early acute GVH, although she had no signs of engraftment at the time of dictation making this unlikely.
DIC laboratories were sent off given her persistent platelet requirement and were negative for evidence of DIC by haptoglobin, LDH, INR, and fibrinogen.
It took her a prolonged period of time to develop therapeutic levels of cyclosporin.
Blood cultures from [**2126-2-21**] did grow out coag-negative Staph pansensitive to Vancomycin in [**4-7**] bottles.
Surveillance cultures are negative at the time of dictation.
Urine cultures and urinalysis were negative.
