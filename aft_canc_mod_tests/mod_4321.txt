Pathology showed low-grade adenocarcinoma of the colon with 10 of 17 pericolic lymph nodes being positive in the left colon.
Her pre-op CEA was 1.6.
-- [**2099-7-28**] her CT torso showed no evidence of disease.
-- [**2100-3-16**] CT abdomen that showed 4 solid appearing lesions w/in the liver consistent w/metastatic disease.
-- [**2100-3-24**] a liver biopsy was planned.
This procedure was aborted d/t difficult sedation and another biopsy was not attempted.
-- [**2100-7-9**] Colonoscopy demonstrated submucosal prominence with overlying ulceration with some slight kinking of the edges, status post biopsy, very worrisome for malignancy at 20 cm.
Pathology showed multiple foci of adenocarcinoma consistent with the patient's known adenocarcinoma of the colon.
-- [**2100-7-27**] CT showed a 4cm hypodense lesion in the right lobe of the liver and a second hypodense lesion which measures 3.1cm in size.
A pre-operative CT torso was done [**2100-8-11**] and again showed unchanged liver lesions (when compared to [**7-28**] study), unchanged pelvic adenopathy and no new interval lesions.

[**8-31**] CXR FOR PORT EVAL: FINDINGS:  PA, lateral, and oblique views of the chest were obtained with the patient in the upright position.
We would recommend performing recanalization and further evaluation under fluoroscopic guidance if clinical concern remains.
Brief Hospital Course: # Oxaliplatin desensitization: Followed protocol per hematology/oncology service with one to one monitoring, continuous vital signs monitoring, and premedication protocol including hydroxyzine, famotidine, montelukast, and methylprednisolone.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent, which were ultimately negative, as was a CXR, which was negative for cardiopulmonary process.
However, blood culture, urine culture, and CXR were performed.
RUQ U/S was performed which suggested that transaminitis was most likely secondary to known extensive metastatic disease and no acutely reversible cause of obstruction, inflamation, or infection.
