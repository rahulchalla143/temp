Continued attention on followup imaging is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old male with past medical history of clear cell carcinoma s/p right nephrectomy and adrenectomy with metastasis to pancreas, duodenal wall and pulmonary (nodules) s/p Whipple procedure in [**2143**] complicated by injury to hepatic artery and GI bleed in [**2149**] on anticoaguation from jejunal AVM presents with mahogany colored stools.
As mentioned, OSH EGD negative to jejunum though AVM are usually difficult to visualize and intermittent.
Colonoscopy only showed diverticulosis.
Enteroscopy on [**4-21**] demonstrated no clear source of the bleed.
Hct trended up during the last three days of admission (25->27->29).
The patient would prefer to receive his daily therapies near his home, which is only 8 miles from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital.
Coagulopathy: On admission, INR of 1.7, normal PTT with albumin of 2.2.
Plt of 160 with normal creatinine.
Fever likely in setting of blood tranfusion.
No source of infection noted on exam or review of labs and imaging here.
An outside hospital EGD and colonscopy did not demonstrate any acute source of the bleed and you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
While here, you underwent a CT scan which demonstrated enlargement of your small bowel mass, which was the most likely cause of the bleed.
