Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-11-8**] at 4:10:32 PM  The left atrium is moderately dilated.
MRI OF THE CERVICAL, THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE DATED [**2146-11-8**]   COMPARISONS: MRI of the lumbar spine dated [**2146-10-29**] and [**2146-10-19**]  FINDINGS: MR CERVICAL SPINE: The vertebral body height and alignment is preserved..
Mild disc bulges are again noted at a few levels, not significantly changed since the prior study from [**2146-9-15**].
MR LUMBAR SPINE: Post-surgical changes are again noted status post L5 laminectomy, there is a stable appearance of the post-surgical collection at the L5 level posteriorly.
The soft tissue phlegmon that extends immediately posterior to the L5-S1 disc extends along the nerve roots and is stable in appearance since the prior study when accounting for differences in technique.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2146-11-9**]  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are common causes.
Radiology Report TC WHITE BLOOD CELL STUDY Study Date of [**2146-11-9**]  INTERPRETATION: Following injection of autologous white blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m images of the whole body and chest were obtained at 2 hours.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-11-11**] at 3:25:01 PM      FINAL   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-11-8**], the findings are similar.
The wall motion abnormalities seen on the current study were probably present on the prior study.
1.Osseous fragment adjacent to the lateral malleolus with demineralization of the donor site in the lateral malleolus, could represent old fracture with bone loss, however if the patient has acute symptoms relating to this area, a bone scan or MRI scan is recommended to rule out an osteomyelitis.

**FINAL REPORT [**2146-11-7**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2146-11-7**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2146-11-13**]):       RARE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Blood cultures negative to date, and urine cultures positive for yeast.
Urine cultures x 3 showed growth of yeast >100,000 colonies.
Renal ultrasound was done to rule out fungal ball and showed none.
He will need a repeat urine culture after finishing the full course of treatment.
The patient was evaluated by the Neurosurgery team on presentation, and it was felt that his neuro exam was stable.
Tagged WBC scan did not show any uptake in the lower extremities, though there may have been increased uptake in the right anterior fourth rib.
Neurology was consulted, and the patient had received an EEG which did not show any active epileptiform activity, though it did show slowing and disorganization of the background signals, which suggested a possible mild encephalopathy.
The patient likely had a gout flare, so he was started on a brief prednisone taper, starting with two days of 30mg prednisone.
Xray showed osseous fragment adjacent to the lateral malleolus with demineralization of the donor site in the lateral malleolus, which likely represents old fracture with bone loss though it does not rule out osteomyelitis.
Because the tagged WBC scan had been negative for uptake in the lower extremities, osteomyelitis is unlikely in this site.
# Anemia: Patient has stable anemia during this admission with Hct around 24 (range 20-27), likely a combination of anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia, per iron studies in [**Month (only) 359**].
The patient was on oral hydralazine as well for blood pressure control prior to this hospitalization, but this was discontinued because his blood pressure has been so well controlled with systolic in 110s-120s without it.
His LFTs trended down back to normal prior to discharge.
Patient's INR was elevated mildly to 1.2-1.3 during this hospitalization.
Video Swallow study on [**11-15**] cleared patient for ground solids and nectar-thick liquids with Ensure pudding supplementation.
He will likely need repeat Video Swallow on [**10-30**].
