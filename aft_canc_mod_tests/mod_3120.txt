This is a 72-year-old man who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital five days prior to admission to [**Hospital1 188**] with acute onset of shortness of breath and pulmonary edema, found to be in a hypertensive crisis at 200/110, however, no chest pain at the time with troponins peaking [**12-21**] at 2.5 with flat CKs.
He was worked with Myoview apical inferoseptal ischemia was found with an ejection fraction around 50%.
His blood pressure at that time was also very difficult to control due to the patient's hydronephrosis.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2196-12-27**] for cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization was performed at that time, which revealed 70% ostial left anterior descending artery stenosis with proximal 85% stenosis, 80% stenosis of the third diag, 80% stenosis of the OM-3, 90% stenosis of the right coronary artery.
Left ventriculography was not performed, however, the left renal artery was found to be 90% stenosed proximally, left renal artery was found to be 80% stenosed proximally.
Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 119 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 62 minutes.
Because there was questionable plaque in the aorta, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] requested a neurologic assessment on the patient, therefore the patient was reversed and passed the neurologic assessment, but because the patient's blood pressures were up in the 180s and 190s, the patient was placed on propofol to try to get the blood pressure back under control.
Patient still had difficulty with his blood pressures staying high in the 140s to 160s while on Nipride and nitroglycerin as well as propofol, however, there was a period at which time the blood pressure dipped down to 70s, at which time all of the hypertensive medications were stopped with a little Neo-Synephrine and fluid bolus given which resolved the issue.
Nipride was then restarted which maintained the blood pressure in the 120-130 range.
Physical examination unremarkable with a white count of 14, hematocrit of 32, platelet count of 216, BUN of 23, creatinine 1.4 with baseline of 1.4.
Plan was to restart the patient's beta blockers, to administer 20 mg of Lasix [**Hospital1 **], to administer hydralazine to keep the blood pressure under control, and to continue the chest tube since the patient still had a high output, and to restart the patient the dimension medications.
Patient had a low grade temperature of 100, white count of 13.4, hematocrit of 30.3, and in sinus rhythm at 80 with stable blood pressure 130/50.
The patient is afebrile in sinus rhythm at 61, blood pressure still elevated at 171/77, sating at 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Plan was to watch chest tube output with the hope of discontinuing the chest tubes today with the plan to start discharge planning.
Postoperative day five, patient still with blood pressure control issues, afebrile in sinus rhythm at 64, though with a blood pressure of 174/88, sating at 95 on room air with a white count of 9.2, hematocrit of 31.1, BUN of 26, creatinine 1.0, glucose of 83.
FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient is being discharged home with [**Hospital1 1474**] Visiting Nurse services with the patient to make a follow-up appointment with his cardiologist in [**1-10**] weeks and his cardiac surgeon in [**3-12**] weeks.
