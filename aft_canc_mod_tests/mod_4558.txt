On POD 3 his Jtube feeds were started, on POD 5 his barium swallow was performed which demonstrated no leak so his NGT was removed.
ON POD 10 he underwent EGD because he was becoming clinically much more ill and a CT of his chest demonstrated pericardial and pleural effusion.
EGD demonstrated a frankly necrotic gastric conduit.
He was maintained on a heparin gtt for his Afib and his propensity to clot off the CVVHD lines.
Howeever, his plts dropped and a HIT panel came back positive, so he was changed to argatroban and all his lines were changed out.
He was transitioned back to HD once his BP was tolerating it.
He remained on CVVH, and his respiratory cultures grew Klebsiella for which he was treated with multiple antibiotics.
His ventilatory mode was adjusted, and sputum cultures were sent.
He underwent a head CT scan on [**2180-4-17**] to evaluate his mental status which was negative for acute intra-cranial process.
On [**2180-4-18**], CT scan of his torso demonstrated a tracheal perforation at the level of the ET tube balloon and a loculated R hydropneumothorax.
