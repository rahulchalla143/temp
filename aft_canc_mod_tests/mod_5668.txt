Left lower lobe consolidation which might represent atelectasis or pneumonia.Post-operative aspiration pneumonia is possible and folow-up chest x-ray with short interval is recommended.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior free wall.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-1-19**], the findings are similar.
Endocrinology followed during her stay, with careful monitoring of calcium/phosphorous levels post-operatively.
Her INR was initially supratherapeutic.
Her digoxin and carvediolol were continued, however several days after surgery she was noted to have rapid ventricular response when exerting herself with rates to 130-140 (70-80 at rest), without symptoms.
Her carvedilol was titrated up to 12.5 mg twice a day with improvement in her heart rate; improved conditioning also reduced the degree of rapid ventricular response that was observed.
# Hypotension, somnolence, oliguria: Post-operatively after returning to the floor, patient was noted to be more somnolent, hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 70's-80's, and hypoxic.
She was given intravenous fluids, and after a chest x-ray was completed that was concerning for pulmonary edema, was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
An ABG completed demonstrated hypercapnia.
In the MICU, a transthoracic echo was completed that was without change from prior.
Infectious work-up was unrevealing, and cortisol level was not consistent with adrenal insufficiency.
Her mental status returned to baseline, and her anti-hypertensives were held.
Her urine output also returned to [**Location 213**].
Her hypercapnia was felt to be a combination of her baseline restrictive lung disease, as well as some worsening secondary to pain medications.
At time of discharge, she actually remained mildly hypertensive with systolic blood pressure of 140-150. .
# Systolic congestive heart failure: Repeat echocardiogram as noted above, overall unchanged.
She appeared euvolemic at time of discharge with clear lung exam and no oxygen requirement.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
After your surgery, you transiently had low blood pressure, however no serious reason for this was discovered, and your blood pressure returned to normal after getting intravenous fluids.
The following changes were made to your medications: - CALCIUM CARBONATE: STARTED 1500 mg every 8 hours - CALCITRIOL: STARTED 0.25 mg daily - CARVEDILOL: INCREASED to 12.5 mg twice a day  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
