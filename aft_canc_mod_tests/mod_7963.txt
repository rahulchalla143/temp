Her CXR showed no significant change per radiology; she was guaiac negative; and EKG showed sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.
Studies returned and CTA to r/out PE showed a large right sided breast mass with mets to bone/ribs a/w fractures.
RUQ U/S was also performed which showed a liver mass as well.
Subequently, the patient triggered for O2 sat 90% on 6L-->NRB 97%.
Her last hemoglobin A1c was 7.7 in [**5-/2103**] at [**Last Name (un) **].
Her last pulmonary function tests were in [**2096**].
Last mammogram in [**2090**], has refused repeat mammography and other health maintenance screening tests.

Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier.
CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
Suboptimal study for evaluation of tracheobronchial malacia due to poor airway expansion in inspiratory phase.
A bone scan for further evaluation of extent of osseous metastases is recommended.
There is no definite evidence of lymphangitic tumor spread; however, the evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma and interstitium is limited due to hypoventilatory changes.
TTE [**2104-6-11**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: small, consolidating pericardial effusion; no tamponade -------- Repeat Echo [**2104-6-17**] : No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are normal.
-------------- Abd X-ray:Limited demonstrating small or large bowel distention which could be secondary to ileus or partial small-bowel obstruction; if further evaluation needed, consider CT. ------------- Liver U/S: The entire study was significantly limited by patient body habitus.
B)  Right lobe #2: Metastatic carcinoma; see note.
She had a CT chest.
A Head CT showed no mets.
Ultrasound of liver showed masses.
#Respiratory Distress: Initial work-up was notable for tracheo-bronchial malacia (TBM) but little other acute lung pathology.
CT of the chest demonstrated no e/o lymphangitic spread of tumor, significant effusions, or PE.
She had an echo showing a normal EF bu small effusion w/o tamponade physiology.
She had a repeat echo a week later showing an unchanged small effusion w/o tampondade.
Her CXR showed a question of mild pulmonary edema; however, it was difficult to evaluate given her body habitus.
She received a head CT which  was normal.
An ABG showed CO2 retention.
It was determined that her narcotics were not related to her mental status as she barely required any PNR medication and as she was doing well on fentanyl.
