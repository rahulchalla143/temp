CT Head no acute intracranial process .
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
MRI HEAD:IMPRESSION: Small areas of acute infarct in the left parietooccipital region.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-4-8**], the right ventricular cavity size is smaller and free wall motion is improved.
No evidence of enhancement of the 2.3 cm right renal lesion of concern on CT [**2146-4-7**], which is compatible with a hemorrhagic cyst.
Underwent TTE which showed RV dilation and PFO.
LENIs showed DVt popliteal vein.
Continued on hep gtt but converting to lovenox or coumadin held in light of tepeated LENIs which showed progression of clot and concern that she may need IVC filter.
Repeat TTE on the floor showed improvement in RV strain with less flow across PFO.
Although patient with infarct findings on CT/MRI brain, neurology consultation showed benefit > risk for both lysis and anticoagulation.
# Renall mass - seen on CT scan, concerning for malignancy; MRI demonstrated hemorrhagic cyst rather than lesion concerning for renal cell carcinoma.
Also with evidence of RV dilation on CT concerning for strain and decrease CO.
Non-focal neuro exam pointed away from bleed/TIA.
