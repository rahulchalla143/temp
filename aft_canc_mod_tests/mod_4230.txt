There, her head CT, neck CT, and pelvis X ray were negative.
CXR was reported negative.

EKG c/w atrial fibrillation, LAD, and no peaked T waves.
Then, BP trended down to the SBP 80s, so she was given IVF boluses, total of about 2.3L by the time of transfer (including OSH fluid).

Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2170-9-13**]):       Reported to and read back by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ 4:22A [**2170-9-13**].
Performed by latex agglutination  CT ABD/PELVIS: IMPRESSION: 1.
Suboptimal study due to lack of IV contrast.
ECHO The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior posterior akinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-4-4**], the heart rate during the previous study is significantly higher, making the left venbtricular ejection fraction and stroke volume lower, but intrinsic function is probably similar.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo F with AF on warfarin, sCHF with EF 25-30% in [**3-/2170**], h/o large B cell lymphoma, HTN, HLD who presented with hypotenstion requiring pressors.
