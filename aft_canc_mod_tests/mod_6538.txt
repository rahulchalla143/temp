A choroid plexus papilloma may have a similar appearance, however, unlikely given patient age.
CXR [**1-2**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
CSF Sample [**1-3**]: Cerebrospinal fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
ECG 12-lead [**1-3**]: Sinus rhythm Normal ECG No previous tracing available for comparison   Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 76 134 82 374/402 70 36 54  Head MRI [**1-3**]: FINDINGS: The study is significantly limited due to motion artifact, rendering the T2 sequence nondiagnostic.
Head MRA [**1-3**]: MRA HEAD: The study is somewhat limited due to motion artifacts.
No aneurysm more than 3 mm within the resolution of MR angiogram is noted on the well visualized portions of the arteries.
CT of Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**1-5**]: TECHNIQUE: MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the symphysis after the uneventful intravenous administration of 130 ml Optiray 350 contrast material.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained and reviewed.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Endotracheal tube and NG tube are in standard position.
The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is noted within the bladder lumen.
CT w/3D rendering [**1-11**]: FINDINGS: There have been no significant changes since the prior study.
The mass is seen to be inhomogeneously hyperintense on the post- contrast images currently available.
Comparison with prior studies indicates that this represents contrast enhancement within the tumor.
CONCLUSION: No change since the study of [**2132-1-4**].
Head CT [**1-11**]: FINDINGS: There is diffuse increased edema with blurring of the sulci and complete effacement of the basal cisterns, which is very concerning for impending transtentorial herniation.
High-density fluid in the left lateral ventricle likely represents contrast, although evaluation for underlying hemorrhage is limited.
However, complete obliteration of the quadrigeminal cistern and deformity of the mid brain are suggestive of central herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: 74F brought to [**Hospital3 7362**] by her co-workers for concerns of lethargy.
The initial CT there showed a third ventricular tumor with hydrocephalus.
CSF was sent which showed RBC 985 and WBC 720, Protein 59, and Glucose 46.
On [**1-5**] she underwent CT of the torso to evaluate for alternate etiology of intracerebral mass, which was negative to that effect.
On [**1-8**] an additional CSF sample was sent which showed no isolated WBC/leukocytes and CSF had RBC of 900 and WBC of 0.
On [**1-9**] her neurological examination was much improved and she passed a speech and swallow examination to allow leisure eating.
On [**1-11**] she underwent 3rd ventricular tumor biopsy and Rickham catheter placement.
This was attributed to recovery from anesthesia in the setting of a stable head CT.  On [**1-13**] her examination was much improved and following commands very briskly.
As of [**1-14**] all cultures have not returned any organism.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Two (2)  PO BID (2 times a day).
You will be required to have a MRI with contrast prior to you appointment.
