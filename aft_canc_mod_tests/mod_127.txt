Patient to have chest CT.  [**5-15**] CT Chest WOW: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**5-16**] Echo (TTE): The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
There is no evidence of right heart strain and this all occurred despite of an INR 2.2 on ER presentation.
The patient was followed by hematology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**], whose recommendations were to continue heparin, and to order Factor V Leiden, PT gene mutation, anticardiolipin IgG/M, B2 glycoprotein, CD55 and 59 for PNH, and DAT which were sent and pending.
