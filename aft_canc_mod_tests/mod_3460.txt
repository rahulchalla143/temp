She had a head CT which was negative and CXR which was normal.
In the ED, vitals were T96.6, HR 130, BP 100/63, RR 18, 97% on 3LNC.
Hr blood pressure was 98/54 at its lowest and her HR was 128 at it's highest.
She got a CT abd/pelvis which showed new significant ascites from [**2161-8-7**].
CXR showed low lung volumes, but lung cuts on abdomen CT showed moderate plerula effusions with atelectasis.
Labs were notable for acute renal failure and newly elevated LFTs.
Patient was diagnosed with melanoma 2 years ago when she noted an enlarging groin node found to be positive for metastatic melanoma.
Diff: 85%N, 11.7%L, 2.9%M, 0.1%E, 0.3%B .
(baseline Cr 0.7) .
ALT 105 AST 475 AP 359 T. bili 0.8 Alb 2.6 .
Lactate 5.3 .
CT abd/pelvis.
Renal ultrasound [**2161-11-20**].
NSR at 126 bpm.
EKG unachanged except for rate from [**2161-3-31**].
Detrol, compazine, and opiods (initially) were withheld and mental status mildly improved.
She had a head ct without contrast (patient has contrast allergy) which was reportedly negative.
VQ scan was low prob for PE, though echo shows increased TR gradient and pulmonary artery pressures.
Patient presents with positive UA though urine culture was negative.
Given that cultures were negative, positive UA was likely the effect of the ureteral stent which had been placed at NIH one month prior.
Urology evaluated the stent who felt it was working well, though CT abd/pelvis showed persistent hydronephrosis suggesting the possibility of stent malfuction.
Abdominal ultrasound did not show portal vein thrombus.
Hepatitis serologies were pending at time of death.
Moderate hydronephrosis noted on abodinal CT suggestive of a non-functioning stent, though urology evaluated the patietn and felt it was working but recommended further imaging studies.
