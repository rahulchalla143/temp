[**5-1**] CT head 1.
Compression of the right lateral and third ventricles, with entrapment and severe dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.
MRI may be performed to further assess (along with evaluation of the above mentioned pancreatic lesion).
Further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
A CT head performed that day showed no definitive bleeding, though note was made of a 10x9mm hyperdensity associated with the falx.
This finding was discussed with the neurosurgery team who felt no immediate surgical intervention was needed and followup CT scan was recommended.
An emergent CT head was obtained following transfer to the MICU which showed large right sided subdural hematoma with subfalcine and uncal herniation.
An emergent neurosurgical evaluation was sought once these findings were made.
She underwent RUQ U/S with dopplers that showed cirrhotic liver.
Her INR was 4.1 on admission contiuned to trend up, additionally, her bilirubin also continued to trend up 51.8 prior to MICU transfer.
Hypotension: The patient had SBP ranging between 80-100's.
Her diuretics were held and the patient was given IVF to maintain SBP above 80.
Lung exam shows mild dullness to percussion at bases and CXR shows effusions.
Urine cx was no growth and pt was asymptomatic.
