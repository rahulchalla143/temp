Upper endoscopy again revealed numerous gastric polyps, the likely source of slow GI bleeding.

[**2105-1-11**] CT abd/pelvis  IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2105-1-11**] Chest xray IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-2**] and [**2104-11-25**]:  Large hiatus hernia, filled with air and fluid occupies the midline.
Lung volumes are lower and making it difficult to distinguish between mild dependent edema and atelectasis, particularly on the left.
[**2105-1-12**] LENI FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins.
Assigned Pathologist BROWN,[**Hospital1 **] F. Please contact the pathology department, [**Name (NI) **] [**Numeric Identifier 1434**] PATHOLOGY # [**-1/4919**]  EGD [**2105-1-12**] Impression: Hiatal hernia noted.
EGD [**2105-1-15**] Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
NPO for 24 hours, then clear liquids for another day.
FFP as planned, serial hematocrits, PPI Rx and carafate slurry for 72 hours.
GI Bleed: Patient presented with UGIB in setting of supratherapeutic INR (3.4).
His HCT stabilized by the time of transfer.
Duplex scan demonstrated no residual clot in either leg.
Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium trended from 140 to 150 in setting of GI bleed.
On [**1-15**] prior to EGD INR was 1.4 and he was transfused 1u FFP pre-procedure and 2u FFP post-procedurally to encourage hemostasis of polypectomy sites.
EGD showed 4 polyps requiring resection (+ulceration noted).
He was started on carafate slurry x 72 hours post procedure (stopped Sat evening), continued on [**Hospital1 **] pantoprazole 40mg IV, and monitored w Q8 hct levels.
His hct was noted to be stable in his postprocedural course.
Since pt is independent and lives alone, it was decided to send pt for close monitoring for 3-4 days at rehab center and physical therapy services.
Plan to monitor clinically (BP, HR) and check Hct Sunday AM, Monday AM, Wednesday AM, and Friday AM.
DVT was in setting of recent immobilization after ankle fracture, and patient received approx 7 weeks of anticoagulation.
Recent LENI was negative for DVT obtained in MICU.
Repeat EKG showed NSR.

A leg ultrasound showed resolution of the blood clot in your leg.
We recommend hematocrit checks on Sunday and Monday, and this can be done 2x/week (Wed/Fri) next week.
Subsequently, hematocrit labs can be stopped and you can be followed clinically for any concern for bright red bleeding.
