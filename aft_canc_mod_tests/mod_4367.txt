In the workup of one of his recent bouts with this, a CT scan was performed and cuts from this revealed a cystic lesion in the pancreas.
He subsequently was worked up with an endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration of this tissue revealed a cystic neuroendocrine neoplasm.
Furthermore, a detailed CT scan the abdomen showed that he had multiple cystic lesions throughout his liver and kidneys; but that there was a suspicious-appearing lesion in the superior pole of the left kidney that might also be a neoplastic problem.

Results from recent endoscopic FNA biopsy are consistent with a neuroendocrine lesion, which is concordant with the imaging findings.

The need for further evaluation with ultrasound should be determined on a clinical basis.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%).
This is a nondiagnostic study - no obvious intracardiac shunt seen during color flow imaging and air buibble contrast injection, but cannot be excluded with certainty on the basis of this study .
It consists of an unoriented segment of pancreas with attached blood clot measuring overall 5 x 3.1 x 2.1 cm.
The parenchymal resection margin is inked yellow and the outer surface of the pancreas is blue inked and the specimen is sliced horizontally to reveal a solid-cystic mass measuring 2.5 x 2.3 x 1.9 cm, located 2 cm away from the parenchymal resection margin at its closest approach.
The specimen is represented as follows: C = sections through the parenchymal resection margin, D = section of the mass in relation to the normal pancreas and the parenchymal resection margin, E-G = additional representative sections of mass, H = sections of the peripancreatic fat containing possible lymph nodes.

Serial hematocrits remained stable.
While on the floor, his diet had been advanced to fulls, the epidural was discontinued, and the patient started on a Dilaudid PCA, and JP amylase levels were sent.
Cycled cardiac enzymes were unremarkable.
Chest CT revealed findings consistent with aspiration pneumonia, for which patient was started on IV Vancomycin and Cefepime.
Abdominal/pelvic CT revealed apparent air in the nondependent portion of the cecum and proximal ascending colon is unlikely to represent pneumatosis and likely represents air mixed with fecal material.
He developed acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.4, which responded well to IV fluid boluses x2 with inproved urine output.
Repeat Chest/abdominal/pelvic CT on [**2119-12-17**] demonstrated multifocal bilateral lung consolidations compatible with pneumonia, which had worsened in the interval.
WBC did remain in the 24-30 range after splenectomy, but the WBC was stable.
