patient had a room air oxygen saturation of 87% which improved to 96% on 6 liters face mask.
Chest x-ray was notable for a large left pleural effusion, moderate right pleural effusion, patchy opacity in the right upper lobe with questionable evidence of pulmonary edema.
staff obtained a PE protocol chest CT which revealed a small PE in one of the left upper lobe segmental branches of the pulmonary artery as well as a SVC clot.
Patient had a head CT that was unremarkable.
Patient was eventually given 40 of IV Lasix times one with 1200 cc of urine output to that and much improved symptoms.
patient's ECG was notable for poor R wave progression, LVH by voltage criteria and [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in V2 and V3.
The first set of CKs that was sent from the emergency department showed CK of 105, MB fraction 7, troponin 0.3.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission patient's temperature was 98.7, pulse 128, blood pressure 167/66.
Jugular venous pressure was appreciated at 7 cm.
Cardiovascular exam was notable for tachycardia, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
Neurologic exam was limited due to patient's respiratory distress, but grossly intact.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 15.1 with differential notable for 65 neutrophils, no bands, 25 lymphocytes, hematocrit 32.6, platelets 957,000.
Sodium was 139, K 3.9, chloride 95, bicarb 28, BUN 27, creatinine 0.7, glucose 127.
She had an ABG done which was on 6 liters face mask which was notable for pH of 7.39, PCO2 46, PO2 121.
ECG as noted above was sinus at 120 with normal QRS axis and normal P axis.
Chest x-ray was described in the HPI as was the CTA.
She was, indeed, acutely dyspneic and required large volumes of oxygen to maintain saturation above 90% on admission.
Patient had an ultrasound guided tap which revealed an exudative effusion with 825 white blood cells, 49,000 red blood cells.
Differential on the white blood cells was notable for no polys, 71 lymphocytes, 11 monos, 7 mesothelial cells that were still being reviewed by pathology at the time of discharge.
Gram stain and culture of her pleural fluid were negative.
Chest x-ray on the day of discharge was notable for some reaccumulation of the right sided fluid.
Her EKG showed anteroseptal changes which evolved from ST elevation to T wave inversion in leads V2 and V3.
Echocardiogram post infarct was notable for an ejection fraction of 40% as well as anteroseptal and anterior free wall hypokinesis.
Patient was eventually weaned off the nitro drip and started on Isordil, captopril and Lopressor to control her blood pressure.
LENIs were performed which showed no evidence of lower extremity DVT.
Given her pressing pulmonary and cardiac issues, she was not evaluated by GI.
However, she may benefit from a barium swallow or endoscopic evaluation in the future.
On the day of discharge her white count was 8.
On the day of discharge hematocrit was 28.2.
Patient was also noted to have platelets that were as high as 1,000,000.
Patient became hypernatremic during the course of her stay with sodium as high as 150.
