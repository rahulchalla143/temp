Selective coronary angiography demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease.
Pressure wire interrogation of the long lesion in the LAD demonstrated a resting FFR of 0.78 which dropped to 0.67 with maximal hyperemia.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the obtuse marginal with a Minivision (2.75x14mm) bare metal stent.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis in the LAD and 30% stenosis in the first diagonal with TIMI III flow throughout (See PTCA comments).
Successful PTCA and stenting of the obtuse marginal with a bare metal stent.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
# STEMI:  Pt had evidence of anterior wall ST elevation MI on ECG and in the cath lab.
First set of CE's CK 89, Trop 0.02 and stayed stable.
He was taken back to the cath lab and had BMS placed in LAD after pressure wire demonstrated it to be a significant lesion.
Cardiac enzymes continued to be flat.
His blood pressure was low so he was not started on an ace inhibitor in the hospital but his outpatient cardiologist will discuss this with him at his visit in a few days.
# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: On TTE patient had evidence of septal RV and LV wall thickening consistent with an infiltrative cardiomyopathy.
On his last interogation in [**10-9**], he was atrial and ventricular sensing 80% of the time.
