Patient states that he had been in subacute rehab and was transferred to [**Hospital3 417**] for CT scan on Friday which was read this morning and he was subsequently transferred here for further management of his ascites and pleural effusion.
Physical Exam: VS - T: 95.3 BP: 102/60 P:69 R:20 O2 94%RA Gen: elderly, cachectic male in NAD.
cool to touch Skin: extensive bruising, irritated skin tag on back  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   WBC-4.7 RBC-4.46* HGB-13.1* HCT-40.5 MCV-91 MCH-29.3 MCHC-32.3 RDW-17.2* [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   PLT COUNT-187 [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   ALT(SGPT)-11 AST(SGOT)-23 LD(LDH)-214 ALK PHOS-225* TOT BILI-0.8 [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   ALBUMIN-3.7 CALCIUM-9.4 PHOSPHATE-4.9* MAGNESIUM-3.1* [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   GLUCOSE-90 UREA N-56* CREAT-2.2* SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-5.3* CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-30 ANION GAP-17 [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   PT-17.5* PTT-32.9 INR(PT)-1.6*  Admission Echo: Biventricular hypertrophy with echogenic myocardium, restrictive  filling pattern, thickened valvular structures, and a large circumferential pericardial effusion without overt echo signs of tamponade (which may be masked in the setting of severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-1-23**], the pericardial effusion is slightly larger.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-8-1**], a small circumferential pericardial effusion has reaccumulated; no evidence of cardiac tamponade.
CAD - h/o cardiac cath with occluded RCA, unable to recanulize - on ASA, BB and statin, no ACEI [**1-13**] hypotension .
EF 40%, Severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction with low cardiac output.
Echo revealed a large pericardial effusion that was also noted in [**1-18**], although appeared larger.
Though no echocardiographic signs of tamponade were seen, it was thought that tamponade could be masked in setting of RV hypertrophy and pulmonary htn.
The pt was taken to cath lab and was found to have hemodynamics midly suggestive of tamponade with cvp 22, PA 67/29, wedge 28, pericardium 14, with mild improvement in CI from 1.42 to 1.48 after resolving tamponade.
Follow-up ECHO after pericardiocentesis did not reveal reaccumulation.
Rhythm - irreg, irreg, chronic afib - on BB, ASA - no coumadin [**1-13**] allergy/sensitivity .
Pleural effusion: Thoracentesis was done which revealed a transudate with WBC 615, RBC 1475 though gram stain showed no PMNs, no microorganisms.
This improved with improved cardiac output after pericardiocentesis and diuresis.
