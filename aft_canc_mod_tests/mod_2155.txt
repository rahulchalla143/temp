T1 axial and MP- RAGE sagittal images were obtained following gadolinium.
Gadolinium-enhanced MRA of the neck and fat-suppressed axial images of the neck were acquired.
FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI: Comparison was made with the previous MRI of [**2193-4-11**].
IMPRESSION: Previous MRI examination, the patient has undergone resection of a large frontal meningioma with blood products at the surgical site without residual nodular enhancement.
MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis.
MRA of the neck is normal without dissection.
MRA of the head demonstrates no stenosis or occlusion.
Post-op, vascular surgery was consulted, duplex studies performed, and determined to be without injury to the carotid artery.
A urinalysis revealed a UTI.
