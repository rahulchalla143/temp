CXR prior to procedure showed spiculated mass in the left upper lung field retracting the left hilum with volume loss in the LUL area and post procedure there was no evidence of pneumothorax.
Tmax 99.8, SBP initially stable at 110s, then decreased to 50s post intubation and after receiving sedation.
Lactate was 6.0, patient received 4 L of NS but did not respond therefore started on Dopamine and Levophed.
CTA of chest was negative for PE but showed LLL consolidation suggestive of atelectasis with stable LUL mass but new opacities suggestive of aspiration vs. post obstructive PNA.

CXR [**2187-7-31**]: Findings consistent within inoperable lung cancer in left upper lobe.
Repeat CXR post line placement: Satisfactory placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter.
PET CT [**2187-7-2**]: Interval worsening in the region of a left upper lobe linear scar (post XRT): on [**2185-1-21**] soft tissue mass measured at 1.2 x 3.6cm with peak SUV 10.1, today 4 x 2.5cm & peak SUV 14.6.
CTA done in ED was negative for PE.
Blood cultures and urine culture were negative.
Sputum showed both gram positive cocci and gram positive rods.
After initial fluid resuscitation, patient was diuresed, initially slowly due to borderline low BP, then more aggressively.
CXR does not show any evidence of fluid overload.
CXR showed questionable new LUL infiltrate on top of mass in that area, now resolved on CXR.
Her sputum grew out klebsiella and stenotrophomonas that were both sensitive to Bactrim.
CVP was maintain between [**6-29**], MAP >65 and SvO2 >70 with continuous monitoring.
Patient had a cortisol stim test which showed abnormal and paradoxical results but was ultimately started on steroids due to severe COPD.
# Metabolic Acidosis - Initially the patient had an anion gap of 17 with of ABG 7.15/52/329, lactate elevated to 6.0 ->2.2 after aggressive IVF.
Patient also had enzymes drawn with repeat EKG during episodes of anxiety, all negative.
Patient was monitor on tele for new events throughout.
On [**8-10**] patient developed sustained hypertension after another episode of anxiety with SBP >230.
She blood pressure and heart rate improved with light sedation with propofol.
She received another unit of red cells on [**8-15**] for a hematocrit of 24.4.
Her glucose was further elevated once steroids were started.
As her steroids were tapered, her glucose levels were not longer elevated and she no longer required insulin.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted as necessary.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: 100 mg  PO BID (2 times a day).
