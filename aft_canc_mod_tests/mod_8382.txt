He denied any cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, headache, bright red blood per rectum, or melena.
He was noted to be tachycardia to the 150s with a temperature of 102??????.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 102?????
?, blood pressure 70/40, pulse 130-150s, respirations 30, oxygen saturation 94-99% on 5 L oxygen by nasal cannula.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 0.2, hematocrit 21.8, platelet count 15, 90% neutrophils, 0% lymphs, 2% eosinophils; INR 1.2, PTT 27.5; fibrinogen 611; sodium 133, potassium 3.9, chloride 98, CO2 18, BUN 25, creatinine 1.4, glucose 270; AST 9, ALT 27, LDH 87, alkaline phosphatase 103, total bilirubin 1.2, direct bilirubin 0.6, magnesium 1.1, phosphate 2.7.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 150 beats per minute.
On chest x-ray the patient was noted to have possible mild congestive heart failure with small pleural effusions and question of evolving pneumonia at the right lung base.
Infectious disease:  On hospital day #3, the patient had 2 out of 2 blood cultures grow gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
His urine culture subsequently grew coag-negative staph as well.
The patient subsequently had a CT scan of his chest which revealed multiple inflammatory foci within his lungs, as well as bilateral small pleural effusions.
Their consensus was that these nodules most likely represented infected foci with MRSA.
The patient was seen by the Dermatology Service who obtained a biopsy of his right deltoid for pathologic analysis and culture.
The patient subsequently had a CT of his right shoulder which revealed .................. of his fat planes with nearby inflammation and edema.
The patient subsequently had an MRI of his abdomen to rule out hepatosplenic candidiasis after his liver function tests were noted to be mildly elevated.
Subsequent cultures from these fluid collections grew MRSA.
He subsequently had a repeat CAT scan to evaluate for interval change in the pulmonary nodules and psoas collection.
We will dose the Vancomycin only for trough levels of under 20 given his acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
During his hospital course, his white blood cell count returned to the normal range.
Renal:  After the patient's repeat chest and abdomen CT scan, his creatinine increased to 2.0.
The patient had a FENa of approximately 4% which was more consistent with an intrinsic renal etiology.
We dosed his Vancomycin only for trough levels of less than 20.
We anticipate that his creatinine will improve gradually.
