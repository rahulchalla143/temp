Admission Date:  [**2132-12-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-12-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-2-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Keflex  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: malaise, fevers  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year-old man with a history of T cell lymphoma s/p five cycles of CHOP (last dose [**2132-11-28**]) and recently admitted for pneumonia/sepsis and Capnocytophaga bacteremia ([**2132-11-13**] - [**2132-11-26**], [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission) and abdominal pain ([**2132-12-1**] - [**2132-12-3**], no etiology identified) who presents with malaise and fevers.
He was given vancomycin, levoflox, doxy, and clinda for presumed infection/recurrence of his capnocytophagia bacteremia and a chest/abdominal CT demonstrated increased bibasilar consolidation in the lung bases concerning for progressive lymphoma vs pneumonia, but no acute findings in the abdomen.
Labs were notable for lactate of 3.
His pressures responded to 4L IVFs and he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Upon his return to the US in early [**Month (only) 216**], his PCP suspected left inguinal lymphadenopathy and arranged for excisional biopsy of a part of a lymph node.
CT imaging demonstrated bilateral basilar pulmonary nodules and significant lymphadenopathy involving the retroperitoneal, pelvic, and left iliac chains.
Infectious disease work-up was unremarkable.
The CT findings, along with elevated LDH, raised concern about a lymphoproliferative disorder.
PET scan demonstrated intensely FDG avid in the left cervical (SUV 18), right axillary (SUV 5), left supraclavicular (SUV 17), left paratracheal (SUV 13), retroperitoneal (SUV 22,) and left inguinal (SUV 25) lymph node groups.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] repeat excisional biopsy of an FDG-avid inguinal lymph node on [**9-13**].
On histological examination, the lymph node architecture was completely effaced with a background of epithelioid histiocyte granulomatoid aggregates.
BUE [**5-13**], and BLE [**5-13**] both proximally and distally.
Pertinent Results: CT Abd/pelv [**2132-12-7**]: 1.
CXR PA and LAT [**2132-12-7**]: Bilateral basilar opacities, given chronicity question if possibly indicative of progression of underlying known malignancy over infectious process.
CT chest ([**2132-12-9**]): Improved mediastinal lymphadenopathy, persistent bronchiectasis, small nodules have improved in the lingula and right middle lobe.
Grossly stable mediastinal lymph nodes with minimal enlargement of AP window lymph node, which measures up to 9 mm, previously measured 7 mm.
CT sinus ([**2132-12-11**]): Minimal sinus disease as described above  TTE ([**2132-12-11**]): Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year-old man with T cell lymphoma s/p five cycles of CHOP (last dose [**2132-11-28**]) and recently admitted for pneumonia/sepsis and Capnocytophaga bacteremia ([**Date range (1) 82915**]) who presented with malaise, progressive fatigue and fevers and was initially admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension.
Blood and urine cultures did not yield any organisms.
TSH was wnl.
CT abdomen/pelvis on admission revealed interval progression of the bibasilar consolidation, with new involvement of the right middle lobe and lingula.
CT chest was performed and revealed marked improvement of bilateral lower lobe opacities, grossly stable mediastinal lymph nodes.
Acyclovir 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours for 5 days: Last day: Monday, [**12-8**].
Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for epigastic pain.
You also had an endoscopy to evaluate your chronic abdominal pain.
Carafate 1gram 4 times a day 2.
