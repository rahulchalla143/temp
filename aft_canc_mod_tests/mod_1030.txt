Blood cultures initially grew out pansensitive pseudomonas.
Surveillance cultures were negative.
Further work-up of fevers was undertaken.
Cryptococcal antigen, galactomannan and histoplasma antigen were sent off and were all negative.

TB-PCR was negative and nothing grew out on BAL cultures, but eventually returned PCR pos for HSV.
A CT-guided biopsy of the pulmonary nodules seen on chest CT was planned, however patient's platelet count decreased to 6000 and the biopsy was deferred.
