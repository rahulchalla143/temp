[**2132-10-23**] 11:51 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
However, in this regard, MRI scanning with diffusion-weighted imaging, if feasible, is a more sensitive imaging study in the detection of acute brain ischemia.
(W/FLUORO)  [**2132-10-23**] 11:00 AM  FINDINGS: Fluoroscopic examination of the patient's existing feeding tube demonstrated the proximal portion to be coiled within the pharynx.
5 cc of contrast were injected through the tube demonstrating appropriate positioning with the tip in the proximal jejunum.
The study is of marginal diagnostic quality for lung evaluation secondary to respiratory motion.
IMPRESSION: Apparent advancement of enteric feeding tube with distal tip not visualized on chest x-ray examination.
Marginal diagnostic quality of study otherwise, however, no qualitative significant interval change   Brief Hospital Course: pt admitted  underwent a Left lower extremity and bilateral pelvic arteriography of right external iliac angioplasty and stent placement.
Post operative - respiratory distress and is intermittently agitated and non-verbal with decreased responsiveness, in the context of receiving haldol, ativan and morphine for sedation  nuerology consulted - respiratory acidosis with renal compensation / Head CT is normal  transfered to SICU for hemodynamic instability.
