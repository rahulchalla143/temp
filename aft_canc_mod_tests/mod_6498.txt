[**11-9**] CXR: Likely stable bilateral hilar opacities with small L pleural effusion [**11-10**]: CT abd/pelvis: 1.
Mixed response to fluid collections with essentially stable peripancreatic fluid collection but slight interval increase in size to the bilateral retroperitoneal collections.
Within the pelvis the presacral and rectouterine collections are stable to slightly decreased in size with the supravesicular pigtail-containing collection essentially resolved.
[**11-11**] CXR: increased bilateral perihilar opacities, small L pleural effusion, bibasilar opacities (L>R), interval worsening on the R [**11-12**] CT abd: Technically successful CT-guided drainage of bilateral intra-abdominal abscesses with exchange of current to bilateral 16-gauge catheters.
[**11-19**] CT abd: IMPRESSION: 1.
Opacification at the left lung base is virtually unchanged since [**11-6**], probably persistent atelectasis.

She was admitted again started on IV [**Hospital1 5042**]/Levaquin/Meropenem, all blood cultures were negative.
She had a CT which demonstrated large intraabdominal fluid collections.
On [**10-22**] she had a repeat CT scan which still demonstrated large abdominal fluid collections.
On [**10-23**] she went to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy, pancreatic necrosectomy, drainage of 1.5 of ascites; 1.5 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], urb, 3.5 crystalloid.
When returned from OR, had decrease in BP which was treated w/ crystalloid, colloid, and neo.
Had 1800 cc drain output and 300 from NGT.
Was given 1100 cc crystalloid, 25 albumin and 1 RBC.
[**10-27**]: bladder pressures noted to be 17.
Transfused 2 units probes for HCT drop to 24-> appropriate HCT rise to 30.
CT torso obtained showing unchanged L pleural effusion w/ LLL collapse and decreased size of intraabdominal fluid collections.
Underwent bronchi/BAL and thoracentesis - dx & therapeutic (600cc removed) with pigtail catheter placement.
Bctx x 2 sent off and PICC removed with tip cultured.
Bladder pressure 16, CXR showed no PTX.
ECHO not done.
GPC large growth from peritoneal fluid [**11-2**] [**11-4**]: Patient looking more jaundiced, LFTs sent and noted to be elevated (Tbili 1.7, Dbili 1.0).
Bladder pressure 22.
[**11-5**]: Abdominal exam slightly worse.
Fever to 101.3 CXR and cultures sent.
[**11-19**]: After repeated CT scan, two [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains were discontinued.
[**11-27**]: CT scan - stable bilateral retroperitoneal collections.
CT guided drain repositioned output increased after repositioning.
