Lung Cancer Synopsis Staging according to American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual -- 7th Edition, [**2152**]   MACROSCOPIC  Specimen Type:  Lobectomy.
CXR [**2155-9-17**] FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the post-surgical staples are in unchanged position.
CXR [**2155-9-21**] A small apical pneumothorax is present.
This was not present or was obscured on the prior chest x-ray.
CTA [**2155-9-23**] CONCLUSION:  1.
Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is suboptimal.
There is no central pulmonary embolism, but the exam is not diagnostic distally.
Bilateral, more prominent on the left side independent portioned ground-glass opacities around severe emphysema is mostly compatible with pulmonary edema as seen in previous chest x-rays.
CXR [**2155-9-24**] Cardiac size is top normal, accentuated by the low lung volumes.
Widened mediastinum is stable mainly due to mediastinal fat as seen in prior CTs.
CXR [**2155-9-24**] In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there is some increase in the degree of right upper lung pneumothorax.
CXR [**2155-9-28**] Mild interstitial edema is unchanged.

On POD #5 he [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] a clamp trial, which showed no increased pneumothorax on chest xray.
A CTA was obtained which showed no evidence of a PE.
On POD #9, he was transferred to the floor.
His blood sugars were well-controlled during this time on metformin and sliding scale insulin.
His pre op Verapamil was resumed at his home dose of 180 mg daily but over the last 48 hours his blood pressure has ranged from 92/60 to 118/70.
