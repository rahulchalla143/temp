* At [**Hospital1 392**], initial vitals with BP 109/69, HR 133, RR 22, Sat 93% on RA, up to 97% on 2L NC.
Labs were remarkable for WBC 17.5 with bands 11%, neutrophils 82%, hct 36, plt 109K.
Sodium 131, creatinine 2.2.
CK 1502, MB 4.12, troponin 0.33.
ABG 7.44/28/64 on supplemental oxygen.
CXR with probable RLL pneumonia, and questionable effusion.
His blood pressure responded to the low 100s.
A CT head without contrast was also obtained in the ED, initially read as normal but an addendum made note of "acute to subacute left upper anterior corona radiata hypodensity with compression of the left lateral ventricle".
He was started on Heparin IV, and plan was made to proceed with a head MRI, which was deferred pending rule out of a metallic foreign body.
In addition to he above, subsequent labs showed drop in platelets to 71 and hematocrit to 26, INR 1.7, cardiac enzymes trending down.
Immunophenotyping  + for CD34, HLA-DR, CD10, CD19, and dim CD4 consistent with pre-B -cell type ALL.

Physical Exam: Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]: VITALS: Tm 102 at OSH, BP 90s/60s, HR 80s, RR 26, Sat 93% on 3L NC.
NECK: JVP 3-4 cm ASA.

* RELEVANT IMAGING DATA: CXR in ICU: RLL opacity with air bronchogram, probable right LL effusion.
* [**8-5**] CT HEAD without contrast: Initially read as normal, then addendum: "Fluid densities in both middle ear cavities consistent with low grade OM.
* [**2132-8-5**] CXR 0100: Pathy RLL airspace disease.
* [**2132-8-5**] CXR 1100: Right pleural effusion, appears loculated.
* ECHO [**2132-8-5**]: Normal LV/RV size and function.
[**2132-8-20**]: ECHO: Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-8-6**], there is an improvement in LV function   Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 54 year-old male with AML in remission status post allo-BMT, COPD on chronic prednisone therapy, and probable CAD, who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
After the legionella urine antigen resulted positive, his antbiotics were tailored appropriately.
His chest xray was concerning for cavitary lesion so sputum culture and AFB samples were sent; these were negative.
Upon transfer to the BMT unit, his RR was 20 and O2 sat 99% on 50% face mask.
He remained afebrile on the BMT floor and his oxygen requirements were steadily reduced.
2) Delta Mental status: The patient initially presented with reportedly slurred speech and had a head CT that was intially concerning for an infarct.
An repeat head CT performed following transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] was concerning for an infectious process and he was treated with vancomycin/zosyn.
A follow-up MRI revealed no evidence of abscess formation, so the antibiotics for this indication were discontinued.
He was discharged to follow-up with neurology and to have a repeat MRI to assess for stability of the brain lesion.
3) Labile blood pressure: Following extubation the patient had labile blood pressure.
After transfer, his blood pressure was 90/60 but was asymptomatic from it.
The hypotension was thought secondary to adrenal insufficieny however, he underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**]-stim test with an post-stim change of ~13 units.
His baseline creatinine was 1.2-1.6.
His creatinine slowly improved, however, his creatinine improvement stalled and upon discharge was 2.5  He received supplemental free water to correct hypernatremia.
He will follow-up with nephrology upon discharge and to have his serum chemistries checked at the [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] 7 clinic.
5) Thrombocytopenia: On presentation to [**Hospital3 5365**] his platelet count was >100,000.
He was started on heparin for the potential stroke and 13 hours later had a platelet count of 71,000.
After transfer, his platelets continued to trend down reaching a nadir of 31,000.
His platelet count gradually recovered reaching 73,000 prior to discharge.
If his platelet count does not recover appropriately after discharge, a bone marrow biopsy would be considered.
His Hct was supported with occasional transfusions and was stable prior to discharge.
With concern for the thrombocytopenia that developed in the hospital, a bone marrow biopsy will be considered as an outpatient if his platelets do not recover appropriately.
His hypernatremia was managed with free water boluses and his electrolytes were repleted as needed.
You should have the MRI before your neurology appointment.
