Given the history of fever and cough reported on the previous chest radiograph, these are concerning for infectious pneumonia.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Grossly preserved biventricular systolic function  Brief Hospital Course: # Fevers: Transferred from outside hospital with pathologic diagnosis of Sweet's Syndrome, based on skin biopsy and persistent fevers/leukocytosis.
Initial infectious workup including blood and urine cultures was unrevealing.
CT of the chest revealed large bilateral consolidations, and the patient was started on broad antibiotic coverage for hospital acquired pneumonia, including vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
The patient underwent lumbar puncture with IR guidance, which yielded ~15 cc of bloody CSF.
Initial gram stain on the CSF revealed gram negative rods, and ampicillin was added for potential listeria meningitis, in the event that the gram negative rods reported on gram stain were actually gram variable.
The CSF gram stain findings were subsequently changed from gram negative rods to "no organisms."
Infectious disease was consulted prior to the above CT findings, and initially recommended holding antibiotic therapy, as well as sending a number of serologic infectious studies (HSV PCR in CSF, VZV PCR, West [**Doctor First Name **] PCR, Eastern Equine Encephalitis PCR, enteroviral PCR, mycoplasma PCR, VDRL per ID).
Liver function tests were benign.
EEG revealed mild to moderate encephalopathy involving both cortical and subcortical structures, without epileptiform features.
His WBC count increased rapidly to 47,000.
On arrival initial calcium levels were measured at 12.1, with an albumin of 2.6.
PTH levels were elevated at 106.
PTHrP was sent off to an outside lab.
LENIs were negative for clot.
