Of note, he had a recent CT scan of the chest that showed a moderate to large pericardial effusion.
Per report in ER his SBPs were in the 150s and his O2 sats were stable.
CXR showed recurrent pleural effusion.
Physical Exam: On discharge: 97.5  95  145/77  20  99%ra GENL: WD, WN, NAD Neuro: A&O x3, mae CV: RRR, no m/r/g Lungs: decreased BS on R, clear on L anteriorly Abd: soft, nt, nd, +Bs Ext: no edema, 2+ pedal pulses   Pertinent Results: CXR [**6-26**]: The lobulated mass lesion in the lateral right upper lobe is again identified and stable relative to the CT dated [**2189-6-23**].
The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and globular particularly on lateral view consistent with underlying pericardial effusion.
TTE [**6-26**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Clinically he was hemodynamically stable, however echo showed RV collapse and cath showed equalization of diastolic pressures suggestive of tamponade physiology.
A repeat ECHO was done at that time which showed resolution of his effusion.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and decision was made to perform pericardial window which was done on [**6-30**] in the OR.
Postoperative CXR .
The cardiac team placed a pericardial drain and the pt.
A code stroke was called, neurology evaluated the patient, and an emergent CT head as well as MRI/MRA were performed.
The CT showed no evidence of bleed or mass effect.
is to get a repeat CTA in 6 months for follow-up.
