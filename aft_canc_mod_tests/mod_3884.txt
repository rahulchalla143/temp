CXR done prior to clinic visit revealed a large left pleural effusion and was therefore planned for admission on 11r for pleurocentesis.
She responded well to these but continued to have audible stridor so was transferred to ED for further work-up prior to admission.

HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, no scleral icterus, MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no significant JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: reduced air entry bilaterally left more than right Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Extremities: No edema, 2+ radial, DP pulses b/l cns [**2-15**] intact   Pertinent Results: CXR [**8-29**]: Since [**2118-7-28**], anterior mediastinal mass decreased in thickness on the left, adjacent to the aortic knob, from 2.7 cm to 1.5 cm.
TTE [**8-31**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-7-26**], the pericardial effusion is much larger and tamponade physiology is now suggested.

On [**9-14**] she had a TTE which showed a reaccumulation of her pericardial effusion with consolidation.
Her dilt was held due to hypotension and her HR slowly came up to the 140's to 160's.
Patient had an ECHO which showed tamponade physiology.
A CXR on [**9-8**] showed no reaccumulation of the pleural effusions.
She had a TTE on [**9-6**] which showed no reacccumulation of her pericardial effusion.
She had a CXR on [**9-11**] done due to increasing cough which showed reaccumulation of her pleural effusions so she had a pleurex drain placed by IP on [**9-12**] for drainage.
A TTE on [**9-12**] showed a small pericardial effusion.
Due to episodes of hypotension and tachycardia another TTE was done on [**9-14**] which showed a reaccumulation of a moderate to large pericardial effusion with consolidation.
However, patient acutely rose into 170's with decrease in SBP to 60's, Metoprolol was pushed and rate was controlled with resultant hemodynamic stability.
EKG at the time showed possible SVT versus sinus tachy.
CTA was negative for PE on [**8-31**].
On night of transfer, she went into SVT with HR of 180.
Patient eventually required a diltiazem drip to control HR and BP was closely monitored as it dipped to the 80/40 range, but patient was mentating well with good UOP.
She has been maintained on 60 mg po diltiazem q6h throughout her hospitalization with her rate remaining in the 110's to 120's.
Her vital signs were stable and she was asymptomatic except for palpitations.
A TTE on [**9-12**] showed a small pericardial effusion.
Due to episodes of hypotension and tachycardia another TTE was done on [**9-14**] which showed a reaccumulation of a moderate to large pericardial effusion with consolidation.
BP was controlled with gentle fluid boluses as patient had multiple thoraceneces to remove fluid in the CCU.
On [**9-12**] and [**9-13**] she had a few episodes of hypotension in response to pain medications which responded to IVF boluses.
