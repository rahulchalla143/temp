Admission Date:  [**2180-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-12-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-7-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis  History of Present Illness: 61 year old male with GERD, SCLC dx'd [**8-/2180**] and metastatic to the mediastinum and brain, s/p brain radiation and 4 cycles of chemo and begun on thoracic radiation within the last week, who has had an increasing pericardial effusion which was initially noted on CT in [**Month (only) 359**] of this year.
The patient had an echo on [**12-12**] that revealed a large pericardial effusion with possible tamponade physiology.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2180-12-13**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2180-12-14**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
Fluid Culture in Bottles (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
Imaging / other studies: TTE (prior to drainage): The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling and increased pericardial pressure/tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-9-19**], the effusion is larger with increased pericardial pressure/tamponade now suggested.
The heart rate is also now greater.
TTE (s/p drainage): Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-12-12**], pericardial effusion has been successfully drained.
TTE (1 day s/p drainage): Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No echo evidence of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-12-13**], the previously seen pericardial fluid has been drained.
# Pericardial effusion: Known small effusion from [**9-/2180**] CT chest.
Pericardiocentesis was performed and a drain was placed.
Fluid studies were notable for large amount of RBCs and protein/LDH ratios that satisfied Light's criteria for exudate.
After the procedure, there was no evidence of tamponade on exam and his blood pressures remained stable.
Follow-up TTEs did not show reaccumulation of the effusion and frequent checks were negative for pulsus paradoxus.
# Healthcare associated pneumonia: Based on the CXR finding of post-obstructive pneumonia and bandemia, we gave levofloxacin for coverage of a presumed pneumonia.
Since the patient has a large tumor burden and will be getting XRT on the Monday following discharge, Hematology/Oncology recommended transfusion and he was given 1 unit pRBCs prior to discharge with Hct of 26.2.
We also gave you some blood because your blood count was a little low during your stay.
