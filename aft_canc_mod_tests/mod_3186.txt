CXR [**2140-2-1**]: Severe bilateral pneumonia has not improved since [**1-31**].
Chest CT w/o contrast [**2140-2-1**]: 1.
Healing sternal fracture and several anterior rib fractures, which are not appreciated on the older CT of [**2139-9-15**] but are age indeterminate.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-9-1**], a very small to small pericardial effusion is present.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure was not able to be determined on the current study.
Brief Hospital Course: 35 y/o F with hx of T1DM with severe gastroparesis, prior episodes of DKA, acquired hemophilia, htn, multiple recent admissions for nausea and vomiting, initially presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea found to have multifocal pneumonia requiring ICU monitoring, acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure, difficult to control blood sugars, and acute kidney injury.
CXR demonstrated multifocal PNA.
Legionella was considered and urine legionella sent and ultimately returned negative twice.
She remained on 3L O2 with sats dropping to high 80s and low 90s.
During her hospitalization she required 2 units of blood products for hematocrit of 21 thought to be secondary to acute illness and phlebotomization.
Hct was 25 at time of admission dropped to 21 during the course of her ICU stay.
Her Hct remained stable at 32 for several days prior to her discharge.
Stool studies were all negative.
She was seen by social work who did not feel that an inpatient psychiatry evaluation was needed.
- CT scan in [**3-27**] weeks for resolution for pneumonia, per ID recommendation (vs CXR given the severity of her PNA and concern for cavitation) - Follow up depression - Social work follow up, consider referral to psychiatry - follow up of hematocrit and renal function - will need repeat endoscopy and possibly capsule endoscopy for evaluation of occult GIB.
