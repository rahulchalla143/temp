Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-6-30**], the findings are similar.
IMAGING METHOD:  Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 24%.
3- Calculated LVEF of 24%.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 112282**] is 85M with history of CKD, HTN, HLD, afib on coumadin, PUD s/p UGIB [**1-/2141**] who is presented with chest pain and new EKG changes, found to have elevated troponins and guaic positive stool, with peaked troponins and CK-Mb thought to have a missed antero-septal MI.
An ECHO was obtained with h/o regional systolic dysfunction.
After admission to the CCU CK-MB was 45, then downtrended to 40.
During the stay he was monitored on tele for any arrhythmic complications of MI and any mechanical complications with close following of his vital signs and clinical impression.
He had an echo on [**7-3**] which showed EF 25% Apical left vevntricular aneurysm with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-6-30**], the findings were similar.
When admitted he was noted to have black stools, crits were stable and patient has been clinically stable.
Over the hospital course his K trended down to the 4s on day of d/c it was 5.
This can be coorindated by [**Doctor First Name 3390**] in outpatient setting  # leukocytosis:  The patient was noted to have white count of 16.6 initially, down to 15.5 then down to 10 on [**7-3**].
-PUD: pt should coordinate GI follow up with [**Month (only) 3390**] in outpatient setting abotu PUD which seems to be stable -High platlets: pt should coordinate heme/onc referral with [**Month (only) 3390**] in outpatient setting to further look into ET -follow up potassium levels   Medications on Admission: enalapril 2.5 mg daily Vitamin D3 1000 units daily atenolol 50 mg daily latanoprost 0.005% L eye 1 drop qhs MVI Pravastatin 80 mg qhs Warfarin 5 mg daily colchicine 0.6 mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN   Discharge Medications: 1.
Metoprolol Succinate XL 75 mg PO DAILY please do not take this medication if your systolic blood pressure is below 100 or if your heart rate is below 60.
Outpatient Lab Work please check INR because patient is on coumadin for Afib.
The GI team came by to see you and your Hematocrit was stable (that is a marker for how much you are bleeding).
If you feel chest pain please call 911 right away  please get your BLOOD DRAWN on Saturday [**2141-7-8**] for your INR to be checked.
