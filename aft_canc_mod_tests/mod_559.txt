Sputum culture ([**2144-10-25**] and [**2144-10-26**]): KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE.
Blood culture ([**2144-10-18**]): Neg Blood culture ([**10-26**], [**10-28**]): NGTD .
Urine culture ([**10-19**], [**10-24**], [**10-26**]): Neg Urine culture ([**2144-10-31**]): Neg .
C. Diff ([**2144-10-23**]): Neg .
CXR ([**2144-10-18**]): Chronic blunting of the right costophrenic angle presumably due to scarring and/or chronic effusion.
CXR ([**2144-10-21**]): The patient remains intubated.
CXR ([**2144-10-26**]): 1.
CXR ([**2144-10-28**]): As compared to the previous examination, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
CXR ([**2144-10-29**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube has been removed.
TTE ([**2144-10-20**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2132-6-3**], left ventricular hypertrophy is now identified.
His chest x-ray was initially normal, but developed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates during his ICU admission.
He was paralysed on [**10-20**] and a CVL was placed.
His CVL was removed the same day.
Sputum grew out klebsiella pneumoniae.
His lung exam was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His sodium was initially 128, which improved with hydration.
Cr on discharge was 1.1.
RUQ US showed persistent right hydronephrosis, which could be related to his chronic renal insufficiency.
# RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PAIN:  He had RUQ pain on admission, and an ultrasound showed echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration, but other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
# DIABETES: At home his blood sugars were well controlled on glyburide.
However, in the MICU, his blood sugars were poorly controlled on high-dose steroids.
His CK peaked at 6958 on [**10-19**], which trended down steadily as the dose of steroid was tapered down.

On discharge, you did not require oxygen, and your lung exam sounds clear.
Ultrasound of the abdomen also showed that your right kidney has some distention from urine (called "hydronephrosis"), please follow up with your primary care doctor on this as well.
