[**2121-12-13**] 4:35 PM CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST CT ABDOMEN: Visualized lung bases demonstrate small bilateral pleural effusions, and minor bibasilar atelectasis.
The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
CT PELVIS: Free fluid extends into the pelvis, and within the processus vaginalis, through an inguinal hernia into the left hemiscrotum.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2121-12-13**] 4:34 PM CT CERVICAL SPINE: There is no fracture, or acute cervical spine malalignment.
Right paracentral disc bulge at C5/6 without significant canal narrowing.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2121-12-13**] 4:34 PM FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or evidence of acute vascular territorial infarction.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2121-12-13**] 4:52 PM CHEST PORTABLE: Comparison is made to a prior examination of [**2121-5-10**].
ECG Study Date of [**2121-12-13**]  2:35:26 PM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-5-26**] anterolateral ST-T wave abnormalities are new.
[**2121-12-15**] 3:58 PM CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -77 BY DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Metastatic colon cancer, NG tube placement.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2121-12-15**] 4:36 PM FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited secondary to severe edema bilaterally.
Additionally, the exam was limited given patient discomfort and the right tibials and peroneals on the right were not visualized.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2121-12-15**] 2:36 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-14**], the patient has taken a slightly better inspiration.
There are a few small mediastinal lymph nodes not pathologic by CT size criteria.
Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates a large amount of ascites.
If clinically indicated, a repeated CTA could be performed for better evaluation.
These findings, including the need for further imaging if high clinical suspicion for PE were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4311**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4312**] at 12:30PM on [**2121-12-15**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2121-12-15**] 12:33 AM CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, mass effect, hydrocephalus or infarction.
CXR showed RLL atelectasis.
Exam and CXR dont support pulm edema.
No echo in the system.
All cultures were negative.
No acute intra-abdominal pathology seen on Abdominal CT; cholecystitis is on differential and HIDA or U/S more sensitive for cholecystitis, but given comorbidities, patient was not a candidate for surgical intervention.
