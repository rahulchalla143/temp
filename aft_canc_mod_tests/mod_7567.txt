K was 7.2.
EKG showed no peaked T waves.
Received insulin/D50, calcium gluconate, and kayexalate; also 2 L IVF.
VS on transfer were 111/62, 69, satting well on room air.
Per Hem/Onc note from today, pt needs to have a biopsy sample to test for BRAF V600E mutation.
Past Medical History: Oncologic History (metastatic melanoma w/peritoneal carcinomatosis): [**2134-3-22**] CT abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a moderate-to-large amount of abdominal ascites with extensive carcinomatosis and hepatic metastasis potential measuring 1.3 cm.
[**2134-3-22**] CT scan abdomen and pelvis, diffuse peritoneal thickening and nodularity consistent with carcinomatosis.
[**2134-3-26**] CT-guided biopsy of the omental mass: positive for poorly differentiated malignant cells compatible with metastatic melanoma, positive for S100 and Melan-A, negative for CK7, CK20, PSA, TTF-1 and CDX2.
[**2134-4-1**] PET scan, MRI brain, no findings for metastatic disease, nonspecific white matter abnormalities consistent with old microvascular infarcts.

Physical Exam: ON ADMISSION: Vitals: 96.9, 76, 98/57, 18, 94% on RA General: Alert, oriented, breathing comfortably, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL, MMM, oropharynx clear (wears full upper denture, partial lower) Neck: supple, JVP to angle of jaw Lungs: Faint dry crackles at bases, no wheezes/rhonchi CV: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: impressively distended, mildly tense, no rebound tenderness or guarding GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: moving all extremities spontaneously  Pertinent Results: ON ADMISSION: [**2134-4-12**] 03:35PM   UREA N-40* CREAT-1.8* SODIUM-135 POTASSIUM-6.9* CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-15 [**2134-4-12**] 03:35PM   ALBUMIN-2.8* CALCIUM-8.7 PHOSPHATE-4.5 [**2134-4-12**] 03:35PM   WBC-9.2 RBC-3.49* HGB-10.3* HCT-31.5* MCV-90 MCH-29.4 MCHC-32.6 RDW-13.8 [**2134-4-12**] 03:35PM   NEUTS-76.5* LYMPHS-15.6* MONOS-5.6 EOS-2.0 BASOS-0.3 [**2134-4-12**] 06:40PM URINE  BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-30 GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-TR BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-2* PH-6.0 LEUK-TR [**2134-4-12**] 06:40PM URINE  COLOR-Yellow APPEAR-Clear SP [**Last Name (un) 155**]-1.032  Brief Hospital Course: #ARF/Hyperkalemia: Per Hem/Onc note, only other Cr "on file" before admission was 1.2; 1.7-1.8 on admission.
DDx for ARF included compression of renal veins from ascites (abdominal compartment syndrome), prerenal ARF (high spec gravity on UA) [**3-4**] poor PO intake and/or third-spacing (due to malignancy causing exudative ascites; hypoalbuminemia also decreasing intravascular oncotic pressure), less likely ureteral/renal obstruction from mets (would need to be bilateral to cause Cr bump).
Follow-up K was 5.5.
Ascitic fluid labs (ANC 131 cells/uL; SAAG 0.9, ascitic-fluid-to-serum LDH ratio >1, protein >2.5) consistent with exudative ascites, non-infected.
Ascitic fluid gram stain and culture were negative.
A CT guided biopsy of a peritoneal tumor was performed by IR and sample was sent for BRAF V600E testing to determine whether pt is a candidate for vemurafenib.
Repeat lytes to be checked as outpt, results will be faxed to PCP 3.
You underwent a biopsy under CT guidance for furthing testing on your tumor.
Those tests are still pending and will be followed up by your primary oncology team.
The following changes have been made to your medications: STOP: Lisinopril, Tamsulosin because both medicines can lower your blood pressure  START: Furosemide 20mg by mouth daily to decrease potassium levels  Your potassium level was mildly elevated the day you left.
You will need to have your potassium level checked tomorrow, [**2134-4-18**], to ensure it is not rising and is a safe level.
