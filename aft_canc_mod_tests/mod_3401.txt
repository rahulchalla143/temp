Given the patient's advanced age and peripheral location of the hemorrhages, amyloid angiopathy would be the most reasonable diagnostic consideration.
Please note that the MR angiogram did not encompass the entire area of the hemorrhage, nor was gadolinium enhancement employed at this time.
Perhaps when the hemorrhage regresses, the gadolinium study would be of greater benefit in excluding an underlying mass lesion.
There was some concern for possible underlying amyloid angiopathy, but MRI evaluation was not strongly supportive of this diagnosis.
An MRI with contrast was deffered given his renal insufficiency.
His INR normalized to 1.4.
His neurologic exam remained stable with slight right pronator drift.
Cardiac troponins peaked at 0.85.
His neurologic exam was stable.
Serial CT scans revealed stable size of hemorrhage.
His BP was maintained between 120 and 140 with a MAP of less than 130.
Maximum medical management, with narrow BP goals SBP 110-120 should be achieved.
The patient should follow up with either his primary cardiologist while at rehab or return for a follow up appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation in four weeks.
4) Bilateral Carotid Artery Stnnosis- Carotid US revealed 70-70% stenosis bilaterally.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Fifteen (15) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
Followup Instructions: Close monitoring of your blood pressure and heart rate at rehab will be essential to prevent another heart attack.
