She remained in remission until [**6-19**] when she noted increasing lower extremity bone pain and fatigue and a CBC revealed a decreased white blood count with circulating blasts.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**], had a Hickman line placed, and was induced with 7+3, again attaining complete remission.

Imaging: [**2200-9-26**] Chest CT: 1.
Abdominal Sono [**10-30**]: 1.
Left and main hepatic veins are patent, with limited evaluation of phasicity secondary to patient respiration.
This was not seen on prior ultrasound, but is not significantly changed since prior CT dated [**2200-10-12**], and likely represents a hemangioma.
Stable size of spleen compared with prior CT dated [**2200-10-12**].
CT head [**11-3**]: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage .
CT Torso 9/19:1.
CXR [**11-4**] (last CXR): Right and left central venous lines and ET tube are in stable position.

CMV viral load on [**10-31**] was positive at 56,800, then 78,500.
Respiratory Failure: On day +2 following her stem cell transfusion she began to complain of a dry cough and required 1-2 L O2 by NC to maintain her sats in the mid 90s.
A portable chest X-ray was suggestive of fluid overload but was also worrisome for a diffuse infectious process or an ATG effect.
A chest CT scan showed moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, scattered nodules, ground-glass opacities in a predominantly perihilar distribution, increased septal lines and periportal edema.
The patient had a stable oxygen saturation on 2L, but her breathing became more labored.
Serial CXR suggestive of pulmonary edema with bilateral infiltrates and round opacities suggestive of aspergillus.
Her vital signs remained stable.
Patient was also maintained on high levels of pain control and sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam since attempts to wean her sedation lead to agitation, tachycardia, and episodes of crying (likely secondary to severe pain).
Vancomycin was added on [**2200-10-28**] after blood cultures grew gram positive cocci in pairs and chains.
Surveillance cultures were drawn from all central lines.
On [**10-27**] blood cultures came back positive for Enterococcus, from an unlabelled line.
Patient also had a bronchoscopy with BAL performed on [**10-30**] which showed friable mucosa, no lesions or active bleeding.
Renal Failure: Following her transplant her creatinine rose, thought to be due to cyclosporin toxicity.
Her BUN and Cr improved with HD coming down to a Cr of 3.0.
The decision was made to continue intermittent HD vs. CVVH due to the patient's participation in the Defibrotide study since the pharmacokinetics of the drug were unclear and the patient was not to have any procedures performed while receiving Defibrotide.
Her creatinine remained elevated but decreased from peak to 1.2.
Unfortunately, CVVH was never started due to the patient's declining hemodynamic status.
Liver ultrasounds were done which showed ascites and patent portal and hepatic vein flow.
By [**10-17**] the patient's transaminases were also elevated, and her bilirubin exceeded 2.0.
The patient was followed by a study nurse with extensive study guidelines maintained in the patient's chart and a daily log was filled out in the chart.
Initially the patient received q 6 hourly labs including platelets, hematocrit and INR due to high transfusion requirements.
The patient required ongoing platelet transfusions to maintain platelets greater than 50,000.
HIT antibody was sent which was negative.
The patient was also transfused for Hct <35 in order to maintain liver perfusion and to optimize platelet function.
She completed 14 days of the Defibrotide study on [**10-30**] but was maintained on the drug for continued treatment.
From [**10-29**] onwards the patient was transfused for platelets <30 and then <20.
In terms of FFP, she was transfused approximately 1 unit daily to maintain and INR of 1.5 or less.
She was transfused for Hct <30 and required one unit on [**10-31**] due to blood loss from her ET/NG tubes.
After completing the study she had a RUQ ultrasound which showed no change in her liver and patent vasculature.
Then, CT scan performed on [**11-3**] showed infarction of a large portion of her liver on the right side with question of right hepatic vein thrombosis.
Her liver function tests began to rapidly elevate again to the thousands.
Pulses continued to be present with Doppler.
Lower extremity dopplers were done to r/out DVT which were negative.
On [**10-30**], her shin and ankle appeared more erythematous and it appeared as though she was developing cellulitis of her LE which did not progress past her ankle and lower calf.
Upper GI Bleed: On [**10-30**], NG tube was placed for initiation of a bowel regimen.
DIC labs were sent, for which the interpretation was obscured given her underlying liver disease but were not frankly indicative of DIC (see pertinent labs), although fibrinogen remained elevated.
Her Hct remained relatively stable despite this and required minimal blood transfusions for this problem.
A TTE showed no pericardial effusion but did reveal moderate tricuspid and mitral regurgitation and global mild to moderate hypokinesis, new from previous echocardiogram.
An EKG was unchanged from previous and cardiac enzymes were flat.
They felt that her decreased EF and valvular regurgitation was most likely due to toxicity from her chemotherapy and did not warrant any acute treatment.
Her blood pressure remained borderline high throughout around 140s/80s.
Repeat ECHO was performed on [**11-4**] once the patient became hypotensive and CT showed infarction of her liver and spleen.
This was essentially unchanged with an EF of 40-50%.
Patient was transfused with FFP approximately 1 unit daily and for plts <30, or <50 with active bleeding.
Towards the last few days of her life, her INR steadily increased to >2.0 despite repeated transfusions of FFP.
She had a long period of time when her temperature was stable, although she became hypothermic again, down to 94F during the last few days.
CMV viral loads were drawn weakly and eventually came back positive with 56,800 --> 78,500 copies/ml, which was previously undetectable.
In addition, Enterococcus grew from one of her central lines which was Vancomycin sensitive.
Surveillance cultures were drawn from each line and labelled but remained negative.
Rash: Patient noted to have erythematous area over her upper chest and shoulders, thought to be cellulitis, line infection or possibly the onset of GVHD.
The patient was changed to a fentanyl PCA on [**10-21**] to better control pain/agitation.
She was continued on heavy sedation for comfort with Fentanyl 50 mcg/hr and Midazolam 1 mg/hr.
CT of the head was performed on [**11-3**] which was negative for any bleed or other intracranial changes.
Septic Shock: Patient with dropping blood pressures x 3 days which began on [**11-3**], requiring pressors with Levophed initially and then vasopressin.
On the evening of [**11-5**] her SBP dropped to 40s then not detectable by doppler prior to passing away.
Surveillance cultures were negative and she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals.
Liver Infarction/Splenic infarcts: Initially, patient had dramatically elevated LFTs thought to be due to VOD, this improved with treatment with Defibrotide with essentially normalization of her liver function tests but with persistent hyperbilirubinemia.
On [**11-1**] her LFTs started to rise slowly, and then very dramatically back into the thousands on [**11-5**].
CT of the abdomen was performed which showed a large area of infarction in the right portion of her liver with multiple splenic infarcts.
An embolic source was considered and Echocardiography was performed which was negative for an embolic source.
Most likely this was due to thrombosis of hepatic vein which was poorly visualized on sono and CT scan but suggestive of thrombosis.
Official liver consultation was placed with recommendations for further imaging of the abdomen, however at that stage, the patient was so severely ill that further diagnostic measures were considered futile.
Abdominal distension: CT of the abdomen was negative for obstruction and showed old contrast from prior studies (almost one month prior) still in the colon.
Imaging by CT done the day prior did not reveal any obstruction or free air.
Careful monitoring of electrolytes which were subsequently managed with HD.
