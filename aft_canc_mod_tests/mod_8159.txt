Radiology: OSH CT head [**2193-5-6**] 12:26 Prlim read: a new hyperintensity in the anterolateral left thalamus with a surrounding hypodensity (that was not seen on prior MRI brain in [**2191**]).
There was also a new 2mm hyperintensity in the medial left occipital lobe (not seen on the MRI brain in [**2191**]).

Neurological examination revealed inattention, significant dysarthria, mild right facial weakness with reflex asymmetry on the right with right extensor plantar and clumsier movement in the right hand.
OSH CT head at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] revealed multiple cavernomas with a new hyperintensity in the anterolateral left thalamus with a surrounding hypodensity (that was not seen on prior MRI brain in [**2191**]).
There was also a new 2mm hyperintensity in the medial left occipital lobe (not seen on the MRI brain in [**2191**]).
Given her history and the imaging results, it seems likely that the anterolateral left thalamic cavernoma and the medial left occipital lobe cavernoma are subacute to chronic lesions.
Repeat CT brain at [**Hospital3 26615**] did not show any interval change.
Patient was monitored on telemetry and stroke risk factors were assessed and CEs were <0.01, HbA1c 5.5% and FLP revealed Chol 183 TGCs 53 HDL 82 LDL 90.
CXR revealed moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta but no evidence of acute lung disease.
She was initially admitted to the ICU on [**2193-5-6**] under the stroke service for close monitoring and she was continued on her home medications.
Calcium 600 + D(3) 600 mg(1,500mg) -400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
CT scans at the outside hospital revealed your known multiple cavernomas and a small area of new hemorrhage on the left side of your brain called the thalamus.
Your blood pressure is controlled and there is no other intervntion that can be done at this time regarding your cavernomas.
