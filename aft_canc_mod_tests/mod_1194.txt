In the ED, he was noted to have a room air sat of 88%.
Peripheral blood analysis [**6-7**] showed translocation 9:22, characteristic of CML.

[**2109-4-7**]: CTA chest 1.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a [**Age over 90 **]M with CML, tachy-brady syndrome who presents with syncopal episode, found to be hypoxic with WBC of 50's.
Although the chest xray was relative unremarkable for pulmonary edema.
Further evaluation with CTA was negative except for septal thickening and possible elevated PA pressures.
TTE with shunt studye was negative for shunt.
He was gently diuresed and his oxygentation was normal at time of discharge.
Note was made that although his initial ABG showed a pO2 of 60 c/w hypoxia, his pulse-oximetry was inconsistent likely related to the wide pulse variability secondary to this frequent ectopic rhythm.
He was monitored on telemetry and now pacer requiring rhythms were detected.
Syncope - The cause of the syncope was thought to be a transient bradycardic event.
He remained asymptomatic during his hospital stay despite his irregular heartrate which was felt to be predominantly a low-atrial ectopic rhythm.
The TTE revealed no evidence of outflow obstruction as the cause of the syncope.
The patient had a non-focal neuro exam and per discussions with his PCP the patient was near his baseline.
CML with elevated WBC: The patient has a long history of CML and has been on hydrea for maintenance of the blood counts.
