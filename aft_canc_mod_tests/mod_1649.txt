Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Venous Catheter Mechanical Intubation Radiation Therapy   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 30683**] is a 59-year-old right-handed woman who presents with 4-day history of intermittent dizziness and headaches, and was found on CT at OSH to have ICH and cerebellar infarct.
Her headache was controlled with 600 mg of ibuprofen.
There, a CT showed several areas of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and a left middle cerebellar peduncle infarct extending into the left cerebellum with mild effacement of the fourth ventricle.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
<br> Head CT with contrast: FINDINGS: A ventriculoperitoneal catheter is noted extending across the right frontal region and terminating in the third ventricle.
<br> CT TORSO: 1.
The diffusion-weighted imaging of the brain does not show any infarcts.
There is a large right supraclavicular node and mediastinal and hilar nodes as on the recent CT of the chest.
MRA HEAD: This study is markedly limited due to motion.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Other Studies: -------------- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2106-2-3**] 4:36 PM FINDINGS: Comparison is made to [**2106-1-28**].
ECG ([**2-3**]): Normal sinus rhythm, rate 82.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2106-2-2**] anterior T wave inversions are more pronounced consistent with evolution of myocardial infarction.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2106-2-3**] 4:36 PM FINDINGS: No prior studies are available for comparison.
CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2106-2-3**] 4:37 PM CT OF THE LUMBER SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment of the lumbar spine.
CT PELVIS ORTHO W/O C  [**2106-2-3**] 4:37 PM CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of fracture, dislocation or soft tissue injury.
TTE ([**2-2**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Transmitral Doppler is consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course: Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of ICH.
Head CT showed hemorrhagic cerebral infarct concerning for metastatic disease.
CT torso shows necrotic mediastinal LAD and an adrenal mass.
Her neuro exam on initial evaluation (documented above) is notable for mild apraxia, right LE hyperreflexia, mild right-sided weakness and hypertonia, and intact cranial nerves except a mild right facial droop.
with careful monitoring of serum sodium and osmolality.
2) CAD s/p STEMI The patient had episode of chest pressure and was found to have marked ST elevations anteriorly.
Given difficulty obtaining history from patient, she had CT scan of head/C-spine/L-spine/Pelvis which did not show any acute process.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
Followup Instructions: Primary Care Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 8254**] will be on [**3-9**]@2pm  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4861**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1844**] Date/Time:[**2106-3-8**] 4:00
