She was found to have a torsion of the right ovary and underwent an emergent exploratory laparotomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy.
Final pathology revealed a 15 cm serous cystadenoma of the ovary with a 1 cm disgerminoma of the ovary focussed within the center.
The patient has had laboratory evaluations performed postoperatively and these include an LDH level which is normal, an inhibin level which evidently was normal, hCG level normal.
She had normal liver function tests and blood counts as well.
She has been advised after an evaluation at the [**Hospital 1559**] Medical Center to undergo a staging laparotomy including hysterectomy, left   Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She is relatively healthy.
Bimanual exam reveals no mass or lesion.

Slightly limited exam secondary to motion and body habitus however no pulmonary embolus in the central or segmental pulmonary arteries.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**9-24**], she underwent diagnostic laparoscoy, converted to open total abdominal hysterectomy, left salpingoopherectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, omentectomy, and cystoscopy.
Arterial blood gas demonstrated hypercarbia with pCO2 to 59.
Her 02 sat was 82% on RA and up to mid 90s on CPAP.
On arrival to the ICU the patient's 02 sat 99% on 2L, she was alert, oriented and RR 15, not complaining of any pain.
The CXR was consistent with atelectasis.
The CT did suggest possible aspiration versus infectious etiology with "scattered bilateral peribronchovascular opacities."
2) Sinus Tachycardia: Her sinus tachycardia was of unclear etiology, though clearly documented prior to going to the OR.
CTA was suggestive of possible aspiration pneumonia as an etiology.
4) Anemia: Hematocrit at time of transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was 24.
Given that her temperature was still elevated to 101.2 at the time of transfer, she was started on IV clindamycin empirically for treatment of aspiration pneumonia.
Urine culture was negative, and blood cultures were still pending at the time of hospital discharge.
Urinalysis was negative.
CXR was repeated, demonstrating bibasilar opacities concerning for ongoing aspiration pneumonia.
