Heart rate 85.
Respiratory rate 20.
Blood pressure 115/57.
Weight was 81.4 kilograms.
Vascular: There was 2+ femoral pulses and 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
A duplex ultrasound of the liver on postoperative day 1 demonstrated multiple predominantly echogenic lesions in the liver, most likely hemangiomas, likely hematoma adjacent to the left lobe of the transplanted liver, patency of the portal vein, its major tributaries, the major hepatic veins, the major hepatic artery and its major branches.
Of note a chest x-ray was done while in the ICU that demonstrated left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis and linear atelectasis with scarring in the left mid lung zone.
Postoperative day 1 a repeat chest x-ray demonstrated increased size of bilateral pleural effusion.
His white blood cell count was stable at 4.2.
ABG was acceptable with an O2 saturation of 98%.
On postoperative day 2 it was noted that the patient's creatinine had increased to 2.5 from his baseline of 0.8.
Renal ultrasound was recommended and done.
Creatinine increased to a high of 3.2.
CO2 was 15 and creatinine was 3.2 and he was oliguric.
Of note the patient's weight had increased from a preoperative weight of 81.4 kilograms up to a high of 90.6.
Urine output gradually increased to 1-1/2 liters.
His creatinine started to trend down to 1.5.
His Prograf level increased to 14.5 and the Prograf was decreased to 4 mg p.o.
The creatinine had been trending down to 1.5 and this increased to 1.8.
Gradually the creatinine trended down to baseline of 1.4 to 1.5.
Urine output increased to approximately 1-1/2 liters.
He was initiated on IV Lasix and his weight decreased from a high of 90.6 to 78.1.
A video swallow was done.
On [**2115-2-26**], he had a chest x-ray after repositioning of the central venous line.
O2 saturations ranged 98% on 35% face mask.
He did complain of a non productive cough, and he appeared tachypneic at times with a heart rate in the range of 60 to 80's, normal sinus rhythm.
Blood pressure ranged 110 to 120/60.
Pleural fluid demonstrated no malignant cells.
Pleural culture was sent and this demonstrated no organisms and no growth.
A sputum culture was contaminated.
A repeat pleuro path was done on [**3-3**] for complaints of shortness of breath, a chest x-ray that demonstrated a large effusion, 1300 cc were removed.
A culture was sent and this demonstrated no growth.
Repeat sputum culture was also sent.
O2 saturations were in the 98% range, respiratory rate 20.
A repeat chest x- ray demonstrated no pneumothorax, but there remained a moderate amount of pleural fluid on the left, which was partially loculated apically and laterally.
A repeat chest x-ray on [**3-4**] again demonstrated increased pleural effusion with large left pleural effusion.
He did have 2 further video swallows, one on [**3-5**] that demonstrated improved oral and pharyngeal swallowing ability compared to [**2115-2-26**], but continued aspiration with thin liquids due to impaired vocal cord closure was noted.
Of note, the patient had received an ENT evaluation with notation of the right vocal cord paresis felt to be likely secondary to extubation.
A repeat video swallow on [**3-12**] demonstrated significantly improved oral and pharyngeal swallowing ability with no evidence of aspiration.
Of note, the creatinine did increase to 1.8 on the last 2 days of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.
Potassium ranged 4.6 to 4.8.
Other lab data demonstrated a white count in the range of 3.4 to 3 with a hematocrit of 24.9.
Repeat hematocrit was 28.1.
Liver function tests decreased with his AST being 14, ALT 12, alkaline phosphatase 144, and total bilirubin of 0.7 with an albumin of 2.7.
On hospital day 20 he underwent another duplex of his liver to evaluate the inferior vena cava, as well as the hepatic veins for evaluation of edema.
Of note, the platelet count had decreased around postoperative day 4 to 55.
He did receive 1 bag of platelets and a HIT antibody was sent off.
Vital signs were stable.
His weight had decreased to 78.1 kilograms.
