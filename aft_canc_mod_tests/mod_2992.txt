COMPARISON: Multiple prior examinations of the head, the most recent consistent with CT of the head without contrast dated [**2185-8-25**] at 1034 hours, prior MRI of the head dated [**2185-8-12**] and [**2185-8-9**].
TECHNIQUE: Pre-contrast axial and sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained,axial FLAIR, axial T2, axial magnetic susceptibility and axial diffusion-weighted sequences.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the most recent MRI dated [**2185-8-10**], there is evidence of larger pattern of vasogenic edema, involving the right temporal lobe, apparently extending at the right parahippocampal formation (4:10), the pattern of abnormal enhancement on the right temporal lobe lesion remains similar, extending at the head of the caudate nucleus on the right.
#HEME/Oncology: The patient was diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**] and is s/p 6 cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR.
The had an LP and imaging which showed significant mets to the brain.
He was given steroids and had repeat imaging which showed worsening of mets in increased brain edema.
#Headaches: While presentation was initially concerning for hypertensive urgency, multiple lesions were found on brain MRI and thought to be the cause of his pain.
Pt was sent for brain biopsy which was highly suggestive of lymphoma.
He was treated with PO labetalol and clonidine while in the ICU; pt also required labetalol gtt to achieve post-surgical BP goals of 130-160.
No chest pain, EKG with no ischemic changes on admission.
