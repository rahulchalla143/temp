Her symptoms have been refractory to nebulizer treatments; she notes that she has also been on a 1 month prednisone taper.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.4, HR 108, BP 107/60, RR 24, Pox 100.
Patient underwent CXR that revealed emphysema, stable bilateral pleural effusions.
A CT head was done prior to anticoagulation, as PE was high in the differential, (given her history of metastatic breast CA) and it revealed a new 7 mm mass possibly metastasis vs vascular lesion.
A CTA with gadolinium was performed that revealed no acute PE or aortic pathology.
f.  Malignant pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade - diagnosed [**2116-9-12**] during pericardiocentesis.
g.  Malignant pleural effusion diagnosed [**2116-9-16**] during diagnostic thoracentesis.
h.  s/p left VATS pericardial window as well as a talc pleurodesis, both performed on [**2116-9-17**].
Chest and abdomen CT with contrast on [**2116-9-16**]: Large non hemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion, multiple new scattered sclerotic lesions throughout the thoracolumbar spine compatible with osseous metastasis, new 5-mm nodular soft tissue in the anterior mediastinum since [**2111-12-29**].
Bone Scan ([**2116-10-6**]):  no obvious evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
However, regions of new osseous sclerosis on [**Month (only) **] CT Torso were too small for total body bone scan detection.
[**2117-4-2**]: Began palliative XRT to left scapula, to complete [**2117-4-15**].

Imaging: CXR PA/L [**7-15**]: IMPRESSION: Emphysema, bilateral pleural effusions appear stable.
CT-Head [**7-15**]: 1.
CTA [**7-16**]: 1.
CXR Portable [**7-19**]: FINDINGS: Following thoracentesis, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Since the study of [**7-18**], there is little overall change in the appearance of the bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectatic change.
# Breast CA (brain met) - it was discovered that patient had new brain mets on a CT scan.
Follow up MRI of the spine also showed spine mets (patient could not tolerate contrast because she could not lie flat).
An LP was performed, but did not reveal any cells.
Please follow up on Blood pressure status, as patient had episodes of hypotension that required boluses to keep her BP up.
