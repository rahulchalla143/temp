Admission Date:  [**2169-5-13**]       Discharge Date:   Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old [**Year (4 digits) 595**] female who is non-English speaking who has a history of multiple medical problems including [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], CAD, breast cancer, who presents to the ED with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Review of systems was positive for cough, weight loss of 25-35 pounds, night sweats, negative for fevers and chills and diarrhea.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
EF 55%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 95.6, heart rate 74, blood pressure 187/80, 94% on room air, respirations 19.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Significant for a white count of 14.8, hematocrit 53.5 which is elevated for her but the patient is chronically polycythemic from her [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], platelets 798,000, 89.5 neutrophils, 7 lymphs, 0 monos.
The patient's initial CK was 21 and troponin less than 0.01.
The patient's LFTs were normal and albumin was 4.8.
The patient's chest x-ray showed left midzone consolidation/collapse and a large left-sided pleural effusion which is new from previous x-rays but has been seen on x-rays here as recently as last year.
An EKG was sinus with right bundle branch block.
ABNORMAL CHEST X-RAY:  Given the patient's nonspecific complaints and lack of further information for the patient in the OMR secondary to a new MR number being assigned in the ER, the patient underwent a CT of the torso while in the ER.
The CT demonstrated left upper lobe with a dense consolidation as well as a small opacity, 1.7 by 1.2 cm in the right upper lobe as well as a large left-sided pleural effusion and some small pretracheal nodes.
Given this new pleural effusion, the patient had a thoracentesis the night of admission which demonstrated an exudative effusion with 600 white cells, 54 lymphs, 5 polys, 9 mesothelials, 29 macrophages, and 15,000 reds.
The Gram's stain was negative and the AFP was negative on direct smear.
The patient had two negative AFB sputums and a negative PPD and her respiratory precautions were discontinued.
On chest x-ray following the thoracentesis, a small 10% apical pneumothorax was demonstrated.
On room air, the patient was approximately 88% oxygen saturation without shortness of breath except on exertion.
An ABG demonstrated respiratory acidosis and on examination, the patient sounded wet and she was then diuresed 2 liters with some improvement in her sats and symptoms.
The patient was continued to be diuresed as her daily chest x-rays revealed worsening pulmonary edema, although no change in the apical pneumothorax.
Her oxygen saturations remained 92-94% on [**4-6**] liters, 100% on 100% nonrebreather mask.
The patient did undergo a bedside echocardiogram in the hospital which demonstrated diastolic dysfunction with a normal EF and moderate aortic stenosis.
ABDOMINAL PAIN:  Outside records were obtained from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital which demonstrated that the patient had a recent EGD with duodenal ulcer.
Her creatinine did improve during her hospital course.
