On [**2195-2-24**] a PET CT demonstrated multiple FDG avid liver masses as well as an enlarged FDG avid gastrosplenic lymph node and uptake in the left adrenal gland.
A follow up MRI did not show any discrete hepatic masses but a mass could not be exclude.
There are areas of peripheral peribiliary enhancement within the liver which correspond to the areas of FDG avidity more suggestive of inflammation or infection.
The MRI again demonstrated the enlarged 2.1-cm gastrosplenic lymph node, concerning for metastasis as well as a 11-mm subcu nodule within the anterior abdominal wall along the previously placed left biliary catheter which may represent scar tissue or metastasis.
His appetite and weight have been stable.
Physical Exam: On admission Vitals: Afebrile, vital signs stable Gen: NAD, AOx3, Jaundiced HEENT: Icteric sclera.
Biliary dilation and vessel patency cannot be assessed on this noncontrast study.
On [**2195-3-16**], patient was given FFPs for INR 1.8 and underwent PTC with placement of R anterior, posterior and L biliary drains.
He was briefly weaned off Levophed on the next day, however, his bilirubin continued to increase and patient returned to IR for cholangiogram, which showed hemobilia and obstruction of the drains that was resolved with aspiration/flushing.
However, his bilirubin continued to be elevated.
sputum from [**3-21**] grew 2 types of GNR & sparse growth of yeast.
CXR showed RUL collapse (mucous plug).
repeat CXR showed improved lung fields but required 100% FiO2 for 3 hrs before being able to wean slowly to 70%.
Cr trending up from 1.4 to 1.7.
[**3-28**]: episode of hypotension when levophed decreased 0.09; increased, then BP stablized at 0.1; hyperK - tx w/ insulin/glucose x2 and bicarb; renal to eval for CVVH - per their recs, can start when hyperK worsens; no ST changes [**3-29**]: K 6.3 - more ins/glucose, HCO3; albumin 12.5g TID, lasix 40mg x1=400 urine above baseline but pt also turned in am so actually decreased in pO2 & cxr, creatinine bump to 2.1; repeat dose lasix yielded another 440 urine above baseline.
Continued discussion re: CVVH; discussed w/ T-plant CT chest to look for loculations (right pleural pigtail not draining for ~ 24 hrs but overnight started draining for total 200cc), not agreed upon.
AM gas much improved [**3-30**]: HCT 24 --> txf 2U PRBC.
CXR improving [**4-1**]: No longer on propofol, requiring lower dose of norepi; penile ulcer/necrosis noted, wound consult requested.
Started D5W for sodium of 150.
[**4-10**]: fluids to 50cc/hr NS per transplant [**4-11**]: chest tube replacement cc:cc w/ 1/2NS [**4-12**]: CT output replacement held o/n for + fluid balance [**4-13**]: RUQ US shows mild-mod right but not left biliary dilatation.
Cholangiogram shows left biliary duct is patent, R not patent.
EKG shows afib.
Bicarb given for 7.26, repeated insulin, D50 for repeat K=6.1.
[**4-14**]: R pigtail output dropped off, likely clogged.
3amps bicarb; bili/amylase/cytology for pleural fluid sent [**4-15**]: GPCs in blood cx from RIJ, R SC TLC placed; D10 @ 20ml/hr for hypoglycemia; 1:1 fluid replacement for increased CT output which then decreased over the day, sputum cx for green sputum.
[**4-17**]: tolerating trach collar, still on 0.03 levophed, d/c D10, ordered flexiseal, TFs to goal at 35ml/hr; started NaHCO3 in NS @ 75ml/hr; decreasing UOP - gave 500ml NS, increasing Cr 3.3 [**4-18**]: 1 amp bicarb [**4-19**]: Gave 2 amps bicarb.
Low albumin - started 25g 25% albumin TID.
[**4-20**]: renal US showed no hydronephrosis or stone.
BP did not respond to last albumin [**4-23**]: family meeting planned for [**4-24**], [**Last Name (un) 2830**] spaced to Q24H secondary to renal failure [**4-24**]: Moving towards CMO, DNR/DNI confirmed.
No further lab tests or blood draws.
