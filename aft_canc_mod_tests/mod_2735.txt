Her MRI of the head was negative for metasasis and her PET-CT demonstrated uptake at the site of the LLL nodule but without other nodal uptake.
Arthritis 6.
Overnight she required noninvasive CPAP to maintain O2 saturations > 90%.
Bronchoscopy [**11-26**] demonstrated no abnormality postop.
CXR on [**12-2**] demonstrated LUL collapse and a bronchoscopy was performed with mucus plug extraction.
On [**12-4**] she [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] CT chest with again demonstrated LUL collapse.
Repeat bronchoscopy on [**12-5**] and [**12-6**] yielded decreasing amounts of mucus and on [**12-6**] her CXR began to show signs of improvement.
WBC remained < 10 and she was afebrile throughout her hospital course.
The following summarizes her hospital course from [**12-6**] to [**12-10**]:  On [**12-6**] (POD10) patient was transferred to the floor after a bronch revealing no mucous plug and a post-bronch CXR that showed improved aeration of the left lung.
Her CXRs continued to show a moderate amount of pleural fluid on the left base, so it was felt that she would benefit from an ultrasound with possible tap of her pleural effusion.
Interventional pulmonology was able to drain 800cc of serosanguinous fluid and samples were sent for analysis, culture and cytology (pending).
As per physical therapy's recommendations she will need a short term rehab to be able to get to her baseline activities, and will follow up as an outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
