[**2103-5-2**] BLOOD CX: NEGATIVE .
CXR [**2103-5-2**]: AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  Sternal closure devices and mediastinal clips are seen suggestive of prior CABG.
Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.
Comparison to prior studies is recommended, or alternatively a chest CT for further evaluation.
CXR [**2103-5-7**]: A left-sided PICC catheter extends into the internal jugular vein with distal tip not visualized.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT [**2103-5-6**]: No mass lesion, shift of normal midline structures, hydrocephalus, or major vascular territorial infarct is seen.
The maxillary, ethmoid, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:  The study was severely limited due to the patient motion.
EEG [**2103-5-6**]: FINDINGS: BACKGROUND: During wakefulness, a 10 Hz alpha frequency posterior dominant rhythm was seen bilaterally.
CARDIAC MONITOR: There were occasional premature beats and the average heart rate was 78 bpm.
His sodium has remained stable without further NS boluses.
LFTs, electrolytes, TFT, infectious work-up, head CT, and head MRI were all unrevealing for an alternative etiology.
EEG shows no evidence of epileptiform activity.
Given findings on CT, patient underwent a brain MRI which showed only an old, small stroke.
Thus, he will undergo and MRA of the neck to evaluate his carotids.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate was controlled on his home sotalol.
# Anemia:  Folate and B12 within normal limits but iron studies suggest iron deficiency.
Hematocrit has been stable at 30-32. .
# PPX: aspiration and fall precautions, anticoagulated, on H2B  Medications on Admission: Sotalol 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Coumadin 4 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day: PLEASE MONITOR INR DAILY AND ADJUST DOSE AS NEEDED (GOAL [**1-27**]).
Ferrous Sulfate 300 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Five (5) mL PO DAILY (Daily) for 3 months.
