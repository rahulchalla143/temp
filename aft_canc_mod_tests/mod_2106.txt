HEMATOLOGY:  After hematemesis of 500 cc of frank blood while in the Emergency Department, the patient had 2 units of fresh frozen plasma transfused without any difficulties.
Investigation of this transfusion reaction indicated a nonhemolytic transfusion reaction, and no contraindications exist to subsequent blood product transfusions.
Hematocrit trended up for the remainder of his hospital course, and on discharge had rebounded back to 30 without any additional blood products given.
On [**2168-8-3**], a diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis was performed at bedside which revealed a polymorphonuclear neutrophil count of approximately 500; however, no organisms were seen on Gram stain or grew out in cultures.
Of note, the gallbladder had a few stones and an edematous wall; however, no other signs of acute cholecystitis.
PULMONARY:  The patient was electively intubated prior to esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2168-8-1**] and was extubated after the second esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on [**2168-8-2**].
