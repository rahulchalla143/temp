EEG Reports [**4-19**], [**4-20**] pending  CXR [**2108-4-19**] REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Sepsis and encephalitis with rising white blood cell count and suspected pneumonia.
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with the prior study obtained on [**2108-4-18**] at 5:35 p.m.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.
Left retrocardiac opacity is not visible on the current study and might potentially reflect infectious process in this location.
Neurological exam was only notable for worsening encephalopathy with many brisk movements of all 4 extremities.
A subsequent lumbar puncture revealed VZV antigen and VZV IgM (but not IgG) in her CSF.
She was treated with Fosphenytoin (with levels monitored, up to 150 mg TID), Levetiracetam (up to 2000mg [**Hospital1 **]), Lacosamide (300 mg [**Hospital1 **]), Lorazepam (1 q2h), and propofol.
A similar pattern recurred when a lorazepam wean was attempted.
She was worked up for adrenal insufficiency which revealed a low cortisol, but her blood pressure did not respond to high dose corticosteroids.
