OSH Head CT There is no evidence of intra- or extraaxial hemorrhage, edema,      masses, or acute large territorial infarction.
A retention cyst is seen within the base of      the right maxillary sinus.
OSH lumbar xray  IMPRESSION:      MULTILEVEL DEGENERATIVE CHANGES INCLUDING DEGENERATIVE DISCOGENIC      CHANGE AND LOWER LUMBAR SPINE FACET ARTHROPATHY.
MRI Head w/o contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
Right hip x-ray There are degenerative changes of the right hip with spurring and decreased joint space at the superolateral aspect.
# Right-sided weakness: Head CT at [**Location (un) 620**] was neg for a bleed.
Since pt was unable to follow directions for an MRI without sedation and possible intubation, and the management would not be affected, the MRI was not done at the OSH.
An xray of the right hip and l-spine showed no fx.
Neuro consult was obtained and recommended MRI of head which showed acute infarct in left parietal lobe and global parenchymal atrophy with extensive changes of microvascular ischemia.
# HTN: His BP was elevated on admission and was allowed to be somewhat elevated following post-ischemic stroke guidelines.
# NSTEMI likely [**2-12**] demand; troponins trended down and pt showed no signs of volume overload.
No heart sounds or breath sounds were auscultated for over 1 minute.
Neuro exam showed no reflexes.
