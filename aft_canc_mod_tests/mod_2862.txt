F/u echocardiograms showed no pericardial effusion.
In early [**Month (only) 216**], she had a chest x-ray, which showed multiple pulmonary nodules, followed by CT scan of her chest at [**Location (un) 620**], which confirmed multiple pulmonary nodules, bilateral pleural effusions, and a possible pericardial effusion.
A subsequent lymph node biopsy from the right lateral neck on [**2119-9-14**] and showed poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma consistent with lung primary.
Physical Exam: V- 97.2, 98/65, 92, 22, 96% on 3L, pulsus - 8 gen - NAD HEENT - MM dry, PERRLA, EOMI neck - supple, no JVD lungs - diffuse expiratory wheezes, decreased BS with dullness to percussion b/l, L>R.

Echo [**9-26**], [**9-28**]:  Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right  ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2119-9-26**],  there has been no significant change.
Brief Hospital Course: 67F newly-diagnosed NSCLCa presented originally for echocardiogram to evaluate shortness of breath, found to have significant tamponade.
1) Pericardial effusion:  Catheterization revealed a significant pericardial effusion with tamponade.
Repeat echocardiogram two days following pericardiocentesis revealed no reaccumulation of fluid.
Chest xray revealed a number of nodularities likely due to the patient's NSCLC disease, however, a pneumonia could not be excluded.
On CXR she was noted to have an enlarging left sided pleural effusion.
On [**2119-10-3**] she had an ultrasound guided thoracentesis, at which time 1200mls of fluid were removed.
A repeat CXR on [**2119-10-9**] showed re-accumulation of her left sided pleural effusion and worsening of her right sided pleural effusion.
She had a repeat ultrasound guided thoracentesis on [**2119-10-10**] at which time 1050ml of fluid was removed prior to the proceedure being terminated for [**Date Range **].
Her WBC count resolved with GCSF treatment.
7) Hypotension/decreased Urine output/dehydration: After coming out of the CCU she was found to be hypotensive.
The fluids were held as her albumin was low and the fluid was not remaining intravascular.
Release 12HR Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
