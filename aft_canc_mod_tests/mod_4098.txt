His initial CXR demonstrated evidence of a new R pleural effusion.
CT scan demonstrated a R-sided pleural effusion and 2 new pulmonary nodules.

Given patient's high- risk status of emphysema, a CT chest in 3 months after drainage of right pleural effusion is recommended for further evaluation.

Followup CT within three months is recommended.

echo [**5-15**]-The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-10-29**], the findings are similar.
Repeat chest CT demonstrated persistent pleural effusion, and a CTA on the day of transfer to the ICU demonstrated significant interval increase in pleural effusion with almost complete atelectasis of the RLL.
There was no pneumonic infiltrate, no fever and no white count to suggest an underlying pneumonia.
His Hct has been stable, although the fluid did reaccumulate so fast that a hemothorax [**1-18**] a complication of the initial thoracentesis.
While in the ICU he became hypotensive to 70's requiring 3L of IVF and also was noticed to have a HCT to 24 for which he was transfused 2 units PRBCs.
He was started on vanc/zosyn for broad coverage but this was discontinued after his BP stabilized and there was no evidence of infection.
In addition CXR showed possible recumulation of fluid in the R.lung field.
His vitals stabilized and he was transferred to the medical floor where he remained on 2l nc.
He had his chest tube removed without inciddent and a follow up CXR did not show reaccumulation.
Wet read on his pathology from VATS showed reactive histiocytosis, fibrinous changes, no evidence of CMML involvement or pulmonary/mesothelial malignancy.
He was temporarily on broad spectrum antibiotics but they were discontinued after his cultures were negative.
Blood pressure was stable throughout.
There are no ischemic changes on EKG, and his cardiac enzymes are at his baseline.
EKG was done with no ischemic changes.
He had an echo to look for wall motion abnormalities, which showed an EF of >55%, no new wall motion abnormalities.
He was continued Nephrocaps, sevelamer, calcium acetate -needs one unit of PRBCs and iron studies as per renal on day of discharge .

Your pathology is pending at the time of discharge although preliminarily it does not appear that the tissue obtained from the VATS was malignant.
Your EKG was unchanged and you had an echo that showed good heart function.
