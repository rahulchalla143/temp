An MRI with and without contrast is recommended for further evaluation.
[**7-10**] CT brain: IMPRESSION: 1.
New parenchymal hemorrhage of the medial left temporal lobe, which may be hemorrhagic transformation in the region of the infarct on MRI [**2178-7-9**] or may be due to trauma.
A followup MRI can help to exclude associated tiny metastatic lesions.
[**2178-7-12**] CT head; IMPRESSION:  1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-7-8**], the heart rate is much higher and the global LVEF is now mildly depressed.
Her NCHCT shows a L-PCA territory hypodensity as well as a L cerebellar hypodensity most c/w a subacute stroke.
She was evaluated by cardiology given her troponin of 0.3 in the setting of creatinine of 1.8.
It was thought she did not have any evidence of acute coronary syndrome and the troponin leak may have been due to imbalance of the autonomic nervous system with excessive sympathetic activity and catecholamine release secondary to her stroke vs. demand ischemia, and possibly also contributed from her renal failure.
For her likely embolic strokes, she was continued on lovenox and was deemed not to be an aspirin candidate due to her thrombocytopenia (platelet count in 30s-40s).
A repeat CT head on [**7-10**] revealed new parenchymal hemorrhage of the medial right temporal lobe.
This may be hemorrhagic transformation in the region of infarct on MRI [**2178-7-9**] or due to trauma.
However, subsequent MRI brain on [**7-12**] did not corroborate these areas of possible subarachnoid or intraparenchymal bleed.
On [**7-13**] her examination worsened.
Her MAP dropped to 40-50, and she was given IVF 250 cc boluses x2.
This was turned off because her blood pressure had then dropped.
The patient was turned at 9:30-10, and bradyed to the 40s and dropped her pressure to the 70s.
Her pH was 6.76, and bicarb was started.
Her exam showed blistering of her skin which was very edematous, black colored fingernails and extremities very cold to the touch.
