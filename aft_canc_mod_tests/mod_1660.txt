Tubal ligation [**2125**] 5.
Pertinent Results: Summary of Studies: CXR [**9-11**]: likely aspiration event CTA [**8-26**], [**8-24**]: no evidence of PE, nodules c/w possible metastasis Abdominal CT [**8-24**]: intraabdominal collection of fluid with pelvic  collections decreased [**8-10**] ileogram: no communication between abdominal collection and ileal conduit [**8-8**] CT abd: loculated intraabdominal fluid collection [**2142-8-1**] DVT LE: negative [**7-24**] CT abd: Large collection of gas and debris in the deep pelvis concerning for anastomotic leak, but leakage of oral contrast material has not been demonstrated.

Cardiac enzymes and echocardiogram were essentially normal (borderline PA HTN).
Two CTA studies to evaluate for PE were negative.
Possible aspiration occured on [**2142-9-11**] based on CXR findings.
On [**2142-7-24**], CT revealed collection at rectal anastomosis.
An alloderm closure was attempted on [**2142-9-4**].
Abdominal fistulas with drainage of feculent material devloped on POD#6.
No overt signs of sepsis (hemodynamically stable, WBC stable, low grade fever only, blood culture NGTD).
Loopogram and repeated creatinine levels of drained fluid were not consistent with a urostomy leak.
Her Hct continued to trend down to baseline 27-28.
TSH was elevated twice (peak 27) but T4 was normal/borderline so dose was not changed.
