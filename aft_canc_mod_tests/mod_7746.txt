She underwent a CT scan of the abdomen on [**2123-4-20**], after a failed attempt at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, secondary to a duodenal stenosis.
CT scan showed evidence of upstream dilatation of both the pancreatic duct and marked dilatation of the common bile duct, as well as a 3.3 by 3.3 cm mass in the head of the pancreas.
After this scan was performed, and the information obtained, she underwent a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 94542**] under the care of the Interventional Radiology Service.
This procedure confirmed the CT findings of markedly dilated bilateral hepatic ducts and common bile duct, with a high grade obstruction at the level of the distal common bile duct.
Given her CT angiogram with pancreatic protocol, showing that there was no evidence of anatomic unresectability, it was felt that the patient would benefit from percutaneous transhepatic catheter drainage and preoperative optimization for ultimate Whipple procedure.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine between 1.5 and 2.
Distal extremity pulses were intact bilaterally.
Rectal examination was guaiac negative.
LABORATORY DATA:   Hematocrit of 33.
Platelet count 380.
INR of 0.9.
Serum chemistries notable for sodium of 132; potassium of 3.5; chloride 97; bicarbonate of 26; BUN and creatinine of 15 and 0.6 with a serum glucose of 264.
AST was 84; ALT 92; alkaline phosphatase 755; amylase 78; total bilirubin was 21.2; lipase was 487; calcium 9.8; phosphorus of 2.6; magnesium of 1.7.
CEA level was 14.
Admission stress test showed no evidence of anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes.
She underwent a Persantine MIBI scan on [**2123-4-22**] which showed no evidence of myocardial perfusion defects in the presence of diaphragmatic attenuation.
Her ejection fraction by Persantine MIBI was estimated to be 58%.
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, after these initial diagnostic and therapeutic radiographic studies were performed, was notable for having a nutrition consult, getting supplemental nutrition enterally and parenterally.
Her abdominal examination was notable for having some diffuse guarding and rebound.
Laboratory studies at this time showed a rising white count into the 20+ thousand range.
Her hematocrit was otherwise stable.
Her coagulation studies were notable for an INR of 1.4.
Her serum creatinine was otherwise unchanged.
Her white count was peaked at 31,000.
Hematocrit was 34.
Platelets were 575 and her INR was 1.4.
Creatinine was .4.
The remainder of her electrolytes were within normal limits.
Serum glucose was 180.
Alkaline phosphatase was mildly elevated at 462, which was trending up.
Her initial alkaline phosphatase went higher; however, post PTC, her liver function tests improved until this acute decompensation.
She underwent a repeat CT scan of the abdomen, showing diffuse ascites and some thickening in the area of the porta.
She had Vasopressor dependent shock, necessitating augmentation with Vasopressin and Levophed to maintain her mean arterial pressure greater than 60.
Additionally, she was continued on Bactrim, which was started on [**2123-4-28**], after a positive urine culture had shown Citrobacter fungi.
She underwent a laparotomy which revealed several liters of gross bile within her peritoneal cavity.
