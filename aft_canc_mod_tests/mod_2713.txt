Prior to admission, CT scan of the neck revealed a hypervascular paraspinal mass (originally 4.8x4.5, 2 wks ago now 7.4x6.3cm).
Paradoxical motion of chest was noted and due to a CXR with elevated R hemdiaphragm, concerning for RL collapse, bronchoscopy was performed and significant secretions removed.
Repeat CXR did not reveal much improvement.
A CTA was done and ruled out PE.
His counts dropped on vanco so the vanco was d/c'd and his wbc returned to [**Location 213**].
On [**7-12**], pt's wbc again dropped (consistent with chemo) and he had a fever to 102.2 so cefepime and flagyl were restarted.
He did not require pressors and his BP has been maintained only with fluid boluses.
AMS: Noted to develop after biopsy (with sedation) of neck mass.
LP was done and cytology negative for malignant cells.
MRI and CT were also negative.
MRI of brain and CT torso without evidence of mets.
On [**7-2**], pt underwent bronchoscopy with subcarinal bx showing atypical epithelial cells with prominent nucleoli which was not helpful for diagnosis.
Hepatitis serolgies were negative, dopplers showed nl hepatic flow and no masses on RUQ U/S.
All LFTs trended down over the ICU stay.
Tachycardia: Pt had a CTA in the setting of acute hypoxia and tachycarida, neg for PE.
Basline rates in 110s-120s.

Had an episode of desaturation to 81% on [**7-14**] w/ unchanged CXR and improved with suctioning to 93%.
Repeat CXR on [**7-20**] demonstrated improvement in prior lung opacities.
Lung sounds remained clear, and aggressive suctioning was ensured.
There was concern for CNS disease given that mass was extending into cervical foramina and dura, however initial CSF evaluation was negative.
Repeat Head CT revealed increasing mass however no evidence of CNS disease, with a question of impingment on neural foramina and vertebral arteries.
He continued to become increasingly agitated at night, when he would pull at trach and EKG leads.
Pain Control - Pain difficult to access because of communication difficulties.
