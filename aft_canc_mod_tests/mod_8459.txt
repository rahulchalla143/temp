CXR [**2123-2-21**]: "FINDINGS: Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with mild cardiomegaly and a tortuous and unfolded aorta.
Increased perihilar haziness compared to the prior study may represent early CHF.
TTE [**2123-2-23**]: "Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2121-9-9**], the rhythm is now  atrial fibrillation, and the right ventricular cavity appears larger.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic  function is normal.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2123-2-23**], there is no significant change.  "
Directed examination revealed severe weakness of all extremities, approxiamately 1-2/5 except for triceps and wrist extensors which were 2+/5.
Sensory exam was essentially normal except for vibratory loss in the toes and [**Last Name (un) 64146**].
Motor NCSs of the left ulnar nerve revealed severely reduced RA with normal conduction velocity below the elbow, mildly slowed velocity across the elbow and a mildly prolonged distal latency; F waves were unobtainable.
Sensory NCS of the left median nerve revealed moderately reduced RA with normal conduction velocity.
Sensory NCS of the left ulnar nerve revealed moderately reduced RA with normal conduction velocity.
Sensory NCS of the left radial nerve revealed mildly reduced RA with normal conduction velocity.
Sensory NCS of the right sural nerve revealed moderately decreased RA with moderate slowing of conduction velocity.
Concentric needle electromyography(EMG) of the left deltoid and biceps revealed early recruitment of motor units with an excess of small amplitude, short duration, polyphasic motor units; a few fibrillation potentials were noted in biceps.
EMG of the left tibialis anterior revealed early recruitment of motor units with an excess of small amplitude, short duration, polyphasic motor units without evidence of denervation.
Exam of the left vastus lateralis revealed early recruitment of markedly small amplitude, short duration, polyphasic motor units without denervation.

The examination is performed to rule out epidural abscess.
TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 gradient echo and T1 axial images of the cervical spine were acquired.
FINDINGS: The examination is limited due to motion artifact.
On gradient echo and T1 axial images, no evidence of extrinsic spinal cord compression is appreciated.
A repeat study with sedation would be helpful for further evaluation of the spinal canal if clinically indicated."

A CTA was eventually performed which confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus..  Later during the course of his hospital stay, the patient developed hemoptysis and the heparin gtt was stopped.
A chest CT was not initially performed due to his hemodynamic instability.
A Bronchoscopy performed at the time was not revealing for any obvious pathology and BAL returned negative for all cultures.
The CXR was consistent with a blossoming PNA RLL (necrotizing component as per report).
And a following CT demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacity, LLL abscess, and honeycombing.
His workup however was not revealing for any particular organism.
Stool was found to be negative for c.diff x3, urine cultures did not result in any growth from [**2-22**] and [**2-26**], sputum grew out only sparse bacillus and was negative for yeast.
Blood cultures were also negative throughout his hospital course and the patient tested negative for galactomannan.
A VATS was considered and CT surgery was consulted, they did not feel it was indicated considering his rapid improvement on antibiotics.
TTE on [**2-23**] demonstrated mild pulmonary HTN with EF >55%.
C) Pneumothorax: The patient was found to have right apical pneumothorax on admission CXR on [**2-21**].
As the pneumothorax was enlarging by CXR on [**2-23**], thoracic surgery was consulted and a chest tube was placed.
The CXR was removed a week later without complication and surveillance CXR since then showed complete resolution of CXR.
A daily Hct was followed with intention to transfuse for goal Hct >25.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will follow the patint while at [**Hospital3 **] for his rituximab dosing as well as his decadron taper (anticipate decreasing decadron to 4mg PO once daily on Thurs [**2123-3-18**]).
IVIG was considered for immune re-constitutions as well as for his MDS, however this will be started as an outpatient at Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 103826**] discretion.
While in the MICU, the patient was given numerous fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure and overall resulted in gross anasarca.
The creatinie was stable during the active diuresis at 0.5 and BUN of 20s.
Neurology was consulted and an C-spine MRI as well as EMG was performed.
Creatinine was stable even after aggressive diuresis on the floor.
Lactates trended down and BP was no longer an issue after his acute management.
