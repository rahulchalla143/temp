There, she was noted to have a white blood cell count of 26 with bands, a total bilirubin of 2.4, no acute chest process on chest x-ray, and a mildly positive urine analysis with 1+ LE.
Her INR was over 8, and she was given 10 mg of intravenous vitamin K. Blood and urine cultures were drawn prior to administration of antibiotics.
Her vitals at that time were: temperature of 101.4 rectal, stable blood pressure (never hypotensive, lowest 120/40) 160/70, RR 24, Sat 98% on NRB.
Her laboratories were notable for a transaminitis AST >ALT, lactate 2.4, INR 7.7.
Blood cultures at that time grew:  enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin; E.coli sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins; Klebsiella pansensitive except to amp.
-Diabetes mellitus, type 2 -Hypertension -Coronary artery disease -Parkinson's disease -diastolic CHF -Vaginal Carcinoma -s/p Cholecystectomy -Urosepsis d/t E. coli and Proteus -Bacteremia due to VRE in [**9-12**] treated with 2 week course of Linezolid -Bacteremia due to E. coli in [**9-12**] treated with 2 week course of Ceftriaxone.
A RUQ ultrasound showed no change in biliary dilitation but ERCP showed sludge and stones obstructing the stent which were successfully cleared out.
Pt was initially empirically treated linezolid, ceftriaxone and flagyl given prior h/o VRE and resistent bacteria, and transitioned to only high dose ceftriaxone once blood cultures grew Klebsiella.
Her blood cutlures checked after the initial positive results remained sterile.
Coagulopathy: On presentation pt's INR was 8, likely in setting of poor hepatic clearance of coumadin.
She recieved several doses of Vitamin K and FFP to reverse her INR for ERCP and was NOT restarted on anticoagulation post procedure, out of concern for needing future procedures.
This was not restarted after her procedures due to generally good blood sugar control; however, this can be restarted when necessary at rehab depending on her blood sugars.
Metoprolol was restarted and titrated up to 50mg tid given episodes of afib with RVR in the ICU.
