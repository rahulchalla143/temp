ENT consult to evaluate vocal cord mobility to r/o Left     vocal cord paresis/paralysis  An otolaryngology consult was obtained for evaluation and treatment for this condition, the recommendation which were to observe strict chin-tuck adherence and strict aspiration precautions as the patient was thought to be at great aspiration risk; and twice-daily proton pump inhibitor.
A chest radiograph performed on [**2183-7-29**] showed further improvement in the small left apical pneumothorax and improvement in the interstitial edema.
