Prior chest CT from [**2178-10-30**] is also available for comparison.
FINDINGS: Single portable AP chest radiograph is obtained.
<br>  [**5-5**] EKG - sinus, 1st degree block - noted ST/TW changes from admission - without changes, mild prolonged Qtc <br>  [**5-2**] Echo - EF noted 45-50% <br> The left atrium is dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-2-1**], the inferior septum appears mildly hypokinetic on the current study and the inferior wall is frankly akinetic.
Brief Hospital Course: 82M with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown prior, CAD, advanced Parkinson's Disease p/w PNA and UTI from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab - found also to have positive biomarkers for NSTEMI (due to demand stress) - admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] - cardiology notified - tx with hep gtt - otherwise just medical management, and with abx for PNA.
Dispo: await cardiology assessment, noted mid-line access lost over weekend, PICC nurse unable to access - awaiting IR PICC access in am - once PICC placed and cardiology eval completed - can transfer to back to [**Hospital **] rehab.
Was started with ertepenem at rehab center with pt with resistant klebsiella UTI -tx to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval of high fevers/sob - where additional NSTEMI dx as noted.
Pt tx with vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/levoflox with double coverage for gram negatives in ICU - on [**5-3**] on floor - with pt doing better - d/c levoflox - BCx without growth to date - no sputum sent for cx prior - given [**Hospital **] hospital stay and from NH - will cont coverage for HAP with vanc - and cont meropenum course.
However on [**5-5**] - pt lost complete access - PICC nurse unable to attain any access, and unable to locate site for EJ attempt - given clinical stability AND that pt with PNA process not UTI - will cont treatment with just levofloxacin po - and restart today - and d/c meropenem as a result.
- Change IV vanc to q24h (dose given this am) - due to now access lost - will d/c meropenem - start levofloxacin PO - monitor overnight - needs total of 3 more days of treatment - trying to obtain sputum cx if possible but cont treatment as above - noted [**5-1**] blood cx with no growth to date, and [**4-30**] culture from HRC.
- (urine legionella neg) - to complete total of 8 days of Rx.
