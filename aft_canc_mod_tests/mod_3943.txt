She was aggressively diuresed with IV lasix 40mg qd (she puts out 700cc-1L with this dose), and given additional doses depending on physical exam findings and oxygen requirement on nasal cannula.
Her blood pressure was tightly controlled, and she is on both a beta blocker and an ACEI.
Her lipid panel was checked, no need for statin.
She is now satting well on room air (had been requiring 3L NC, with elev JVP and crackles [**2-10**] way up back on initial presentation).
Her electrolytes were aggressively repleted for K>4, Mg>2, and this should be continued at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
She is to continue her maintenance dose of 40mg IV lasix qd, with monitoring of electrolytes (chem 10) qday and repletion of lytes.
She was monitored on telemetry this entire hospitalization.
She should have her LFTs checked in one month on the amiodarone.
She had baseline LFTs checked here and were normal.
LLL PNA- Consolidation seen on CXR and CTA.
She did not spike further temps and her oxygen sats remained stable, so Vancomycin was never empirically added.
She will need to have her CBC checked on Cefepime.
Plan is to continue IV cefepime for atleast 2 weeks (has 9 more days) with final duration of antibiotic course being determined by her WBC level and her ANC level (to be decided by Hematologist/Oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10005**] [**Name (STitle) **], and her Primary care physician--[**Name10 (NameIs) 788**] follow up appointments).
Abd CT showed a parastomal hernia, no evid obstruction.
Fingersticks on the medical floor have been wnl, so her FSBS were changed from QID to [**Hospital1 **].
Her Hgb A1C was found to be 5. .
Myelodysplastic syndrome- pt with OSH labs on [**2-8**] not far from pancytopenia seen on CBC on admission.
However, pt's WBC and Hct trended down, required 1 unit PRBC while in CCU.
Oncologist at [**Hospital3 **] was called, and verified her severe neutropenia.
She has a follow up appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], but the physicians at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab can also transfuse depending on her Hct and plt levels.
Her ANC should be followed up as well with her WBC ct. .
Oxazepam 15mg po qHS prn 2.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-11**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day) as needed.
Outpatient Lab Work You will also need your CBC, with ANC checked qweek and LFTs checked qmonth on amiodarone.
You have an appointment with your Hematologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10005**] [**Name (STitle) **], who will review your Hematocrit, WBC, ANC and platelets and decide on a transfusion.
For plt count<10, transfuse plt (will depend on level).
