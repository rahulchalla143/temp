Cardiac catheterization - one of your coronary arteries was expanded with a balloon to improve blood flow to your heart.
Upper endoscopy (EGD) - no abnormalities were noted in your esophagus, stomach or duodenum 3.
Colonoscopy - diverticuli (little out-pouchings) were observed in the wall of your colon.
He complained of worsened dyspnea and his BP was noted to be 87/52, he had black guaiac positive stool on exam.
In the ED his VS 85/38 HR 57 RR 18 98.1 99% 2L NC.
His hematocrit was 24.4 down from recent  baseline of 29-30.
He reports recent medication changes were an increase in his furosemide in [**3-/2121**] and an increase in his lisinopril from 5 to 10mg last month.
At time of arrival to the MICU his VS had improved with BP 115/49, he stated he felt like he had more energy after receiving a unit of PRBCs.
Rest of review of systems was negative in detail.

------------------ Cardiac catheterization [**2121-6-11**]: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
That night, he underwent bowel prep for colonoscopy to investigate source of GI bleed.
Early the following morning (~6:30 am), patient began experiencing jaw/neck pain; as this is his anginal equivalent, an EKG was obtained.
EKG showed new ST depression in V5, V6 but the 1st set of cardiac enzymes negative.
The second set of cardiac enzymes returned positive, and the patient was transferred to the cardiology service.
He went for cardiac catheterization on [**6-11**]; balloon angioplasty was performed but no stents placed.
#2 GIB:  There was one report of black stool, which was suspicious for upper GI source.
On ED exam, rectal exam was grossly bloody, which could indicate brisk upper bleed versus lower source, ddx includes AVMs, diverticula, mass, hemorrhoids.
Of note, it seemed as if pt was having oozing intially, as his Hct did not bump as expected after each unit of pRBC.
EGD was performed which showed no abnormality.
Colonoscopy was performed which showed diverticuli with no active bleed.
Hct remained stable, near baseline (29-30 per hematology notes).
BPs 90/40 at last clinic visit, this may be in part due to GIB as well as increase in ACEI and lasix recently.
#4 Acute renal failure - acute on chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine 2.3 at admission (baseline cr 1.5-1.6).
ACE inhibitor and lasix were held and blood was transfused x 4 units; creatinine improved to 1.1 suggesting that medications/anemia/dehydration may have been contributing factors in this case.
Medications on Admission: Metoprolol 200mg Daily Nitoglycerin 0.4mg SL PRN Nitropatch 0.1mg/hour Q24 hours Omeprazole 20mg daily Warfarin 2mg daily ASA 325mg VitB12 shots Qmonth Atorvastatin 40mg daily Clopidogrel 75mg daily Lisinopril 10mg daily Furosemide 40mg daily Folic Acid 1mg daily Epo shots 60,000 weekly (fridays)  Discharge Medications: 1.
Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: Good - No further chest, neck or jaw pain; small hematoma at groin site is not expanding; hematocrit is stable and close to baseline; creatinine is stable at 1.1; shortness of breath occurs with mild exertion, but is similar to baseline; vital signs have been stable.
An EKG and blood tests showed that you had a minor heart attack.
You were transferred to the cardiology service and you went for cardiac catheterization which showed an occlusion of one of your coronary arteries, and balloon angioplasty was used to expand the lumen of the blood vessel to improve blood flow.
You also went for an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy to try to identify the source of the bleeding that you experienced prior to your admission.
-CHANGE Lisinopril to 5 mg PO daily (down from 10 mg) because your blood pressure has been well-controlled recently and the higher dose may cause it to go too low.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
