Final internal length is 50 cm, with the tip positioned in the SVC.
CXR showed LLL infiltrate and labs reveaked WBC of 8.7 with 33% bandemia.
His SBP remained 80s-90s (baseline reportedly 100), so a CVC was placed and norepinephrine was started.
Vitals prior to transfer were: afebrile 95/65 90 15-20 93-94% on 60% FiO2.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: He is approximately 2.5 years status post allo SCT from an unrelated donor for CML.
His last bone marrow biopsy was done in [**1-/2122**] and was consistent with remission from CML.
He last underwent enteroscopy in [**8-/2122**], which showed abnormal mucosa in the jejunum, normal mucosa in the duodenum, and erythema in the whole stomach compatible with gastritis.
In [**11/2122**], his GVHD progressed with skin rash and liver function abnormalities.
His liver function tests have been intermittently elevated and his immunosuppression has been titrated along with this.
In terms of other post-transplant complications, he has had a total of four compression fractures since the beginning of [**2122**] at T8, T9, T11, L1, and L3.
He was on anticoagulation for a PE diagnosed in [**3-/2123**] and this was stopped in [**9-/2123**] as he had received 6 months of anticoagulation and was also at risk for falls.
He was again noted for PE at the end of [**10/2123**] and a DVT in [**12/2123**] and is currently anticoagulated with lovenox.

He had a bronchoscopy that did not show many secretions or mucus plugging.
His chest x-ray appeared clear, CT scan the next day showed a new LLL opacity, and he was treated empirically with Zosyn and linezolid.
After his blood pressure normalized, and with antibiotic treatment his lactate also normalized.
During his stay on the BMT floor, his blood pressure was noted to be normal to slightly elevated.
His MMF was tapered to 500mg qAM/250mg qPM.
CT Chest [**2124-9-17**] demonstrated continued bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions but it was felt that infection was less likely at this time.
He still tended to desaturate to mid 80%s with ambulation and required oxygen 2-3L/min at all times.
# Troponin Leak: Patient noted to have elevated troponin in the ER, with normal CK and CK-MB's, troponin trended down and the CK/CK-MB remained in the normal range.
His EKG did not show any ischemic changes, and the elevated troponins were thought to be due to demand ischemia in the setting of his initial hypotension.
# Hx of PE, DVT: Has hx of multiple PEs in [**2122**] and DVT in early [**2123**], is on chronic anticoagulation, was continued on his home dose of lovenox 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
