Femoral head size was 22 mm diameter with     a 42 mm outside diameter UHR universal head bipolar     component.
The lesion grew significantly, and she presented to us with a huge soft tissue mass of the distal [**11-23**] of her femur, with tumor growing up to the skin near her biopsy site and along the tracks of the locking screws.
She underwent biopsy and excision of the metastasis in her left occipital lobe 8 days ago.
On pre-op evaluation by ortho today, patient complained of 3 days of right eye blurred vision.
Stat head CT showed a left occipital bleed and patient sent to the emergency room for neurosurgery evaluation.
MRI/MRA/MRV was done and prelim read shows an enhancing lesion in the left external capsule/insular region suspicious for metastasis plus another area within the hemorrhage also suspicious for metastasis, making a hemorrhagic met more likely.
Serial neurological exams with plan to repeat head CT in the am.
