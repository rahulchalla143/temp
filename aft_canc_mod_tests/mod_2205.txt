She had a panendoscopy which revealed gastritis and inflammatory bowel disease.
She underwent an MRI for further workup which showed disc herniation, T8-T10, and incidentally also a 6cm subcarinal mass.
A rigid bronchoscopy was performed and a stent was placed in the left main stem with improved aeration of the left lower lobe.
Preliminary pathology was consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.
Her BP remained well controlled after that.
Her VS were stable upon transfer.
Physical Exam: VS: T 99.8, BP 136/40, HR 89, RR 19, O2 sats 100% on 2L Gen: WDWN middle aged male in NAD.
Pertinent Results: [**2173-5-26**] 07:24PM   WBC-14.4* RBC-3.09* HGB-9.1* HCT-27.1* MCV-88 MCH-29.3 MCHC-33.5 RDW-14.8  PLT COUNT-299 [**2173-5-26**] 07:24PM   GLUCOSE-81 UREA N-6 CREAT-0.6 SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-3.5 CHLORIDE-108 TOTAL CO2-20* ANION GAP-13 .
CXR ([**2173-5-27**]): Stent in the left main stem bronchus, with improved aeration of the left lower lobe.
CT Chest ([**2173-5-26**]): 1.
Additional mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy including a prevascular node measuring 2.8 x 1.1 cm, a lower left paratracheal node measuring 2 x 1.3cm and 1-cm bilateral hilar lymph nodes.
Lung tissue biopsy ([**2173-5-27**]): NSCLC .
CT Abdomen/pelvis ([**2173-5-29**]): 1.
MRI head ([**2173-5-30**]): A small amount of chronic microvascular ischemic change without evidence of enhancing abnormality to indicate the presence of intracranial metastatic disease.
Bone scan ([**2173-5-31**]): No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastases.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 y/o F found to have large lung mass at [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further car, now s/p rigid bronchoscopy with stenting of left main bronchus and biopsy confirming NSCLC.
Metastatic workup (i.e MRI of the brain, CT abdomen/pelvis and bone scan) were negative.
Sputum culture revealed no growth.
Leukocytosis was trending down towards discharge.
Murmur disappeared after two days indicating that it was most likely related to flow or transient tissue swelling from the bronchoscopy and stent placement.
Chronic back pain - Patient underwent MRI study at OSH which showed disc herniation, T8-T10, and incidentally also a 6cm subcarinal mass for which she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Metastatic workup did not reveal any bone lesions (see above).
