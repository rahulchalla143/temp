Left frontal rounded hyperdensity suspicious for a hemorrhagic mass lesion such as a metastasis and right subdural hematoma, better visualized on the reference CT examination from [**2172-5-14**] at 12:37 p.m. from [**Hospital6 2561**].
Mild rotation of C1 on C2, as seen on the reference CT C spine.
[**2172-5-14**] CT chest/abd/pel - IMPRESSION: 1.
3.1 x 2.6 cm enhancing right lower outer breast mass, suspicious for malignancy, with left supraclavivular, bilateral axillary, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
An MRI can be obtained for further evaluation.
[**2172-5-14**] CT head - IMPRESSION: 1.
Superior right parietal intraparenchymal hematoma is more diffuse than on the prior study with increased edema and new 4-mm leftward shift of normally midline structures.
If clinically indicated and feasible, MRI could be performed to evaluate for underlying mass lesions in the setting of right breast mass and lymphadenopathy seen on CT Torso [**2172-5-14**].
[**2172-5-15**] CT head - In comparison to study obtained 10 hours prior, there is no significant change in small right frontal subdural hematoma, left parafalcine hematoma and intraventricular hemorrhage.
She underwent frquent neuro checks and repeat scans of her head.
After developing n LUE/LLE paresis repeat CT was significant for a new 4mm shift and expansion of her IVH.
Heme: The patient presented with a hct of 19 and plts <5.
Rib fractures: Left 1st rib; Right 2nd, 3rd rib 4.
Additionally, a lesions were identified within your breast and liver, which you did not wish to further discuss with Hematology/ Oncology.
