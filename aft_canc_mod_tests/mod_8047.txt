She had an elevated white blood cell count to 20,000 and a CT scan that showed a small bowel obstruction with internal hernia.
She was taken immediately to the operating room where an exploratory laparotomy was performed revealing a large segment of ischemic small bowel caused by a dense adhesive band in the right lower quadrant likely present from her prior appendectomy.
On bronchoscopy it was noted there was a large mucus plug and that an ecotrin aspirin (which the patient had never received postoperatively) was in her right mainstem bronchus.
Her CXR improved post-bronchoscopy and the patient transiently improved but declined again.
