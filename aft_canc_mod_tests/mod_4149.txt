TTE [**2150-4-28**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-1-11**], the severity of aortic stenosis has slightly progressed.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS [**2150-4-28**]: There are no abnormalities identified in the proximal pulmonary artery that could correspond to the finding described in the echocardiogram.
A 19 x 11 mm retrosternal soft tissue mass surrounds the left internal mammary artery (3:41); it is unchanged compared to prior study [**2150-4-18**].
CXR PA/Lateral [**2150-4-30**]: Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2150-4-30**]: Compared to [**2150-4-28**] there is interval decrease in left pleural effusion which is currently small to moderate accompanied by atelectasis (at least partially rounded) in the left lower lobe.
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates partially imaged biliary sludge, a relatively small but again partially imaged right kidney and aortic calcifications and otherwise is unremarkable within the limitation of the non-enhanced study that was not designed for evaluation of intra-abdominal pathology.
CT ABDOMEN/PEL W/O CONTRAST:  IMPRESSION: 1.
MRCP or CT should be performed.
INTERPRETATION  Immunophenotypic findings are consistent with involvement by a Lambda-restricted B cell lymphoproliferative disorder, with aberrant coexpression of CD5 (dim, variable).
Review of cytospin preparation showed a predominant population of small mature lymphocytes, with fewer scattered larger atypical plasmacytoid cells.
MRI abdomen [**2150-5-10**]:  MRCP: There is a moderate left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis of the lower portion of the right lung, incompletely imaged.
While the examination is slightly limited by motion and the lack of IV contrast, there is no evidence of a focal pancreatic lesion, particularly in the tail.
Multiplanar imaging provided multiple perspectives.
The finding on CT may have been related to fat infiltration in the pancreatic tail parenchyma and/or volume averaging.
CXR [**2150-5-11**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2150-5-4**], there has been some further increase in pleural fluid in the left hemithorax.
See also corresponding studies performed on   prior pleural fluids (S09-[**Numeric Identifier 61973**] and S09-[**Numeric Identifier 37469**].)
Her oxygenation improved to mid 90s on 2 L NC.
Her CT was concerning for right upper lobe nodules, but these nodules were felt to be mucoid impaction.
Her PPD was normal.
# Lymphoma:  Flow cytometry on the pts initial pleural fluid specimen was consistent with a B cell lymphoma.
CT abd/pel did not show any lymphadenopathy.
A repeat thoracentesis was done to obtain fluid for a pathology cell block.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**2150-5-11**], however there was only aspirate and no definite tissue for pathology from that specimen.
MRI abdomen was performed on [**5-10**] to further evaluate the pts pancreatic hypodensity on CT, and to evaluate for any lymph nodes that could be biopsied.
EGD with gastric fundus biopsy was discussed, but Ms. [**Known lastname 25989**] preferred to wait for further workup as an outpatient, as she did not want to undergo further invasive evaluation.
Her creatinine normalized with gentle diuresis.
# Pancreatic tail hypodensity:  Noted on CT abdomen.
MRI abdomen showed no pancreatic tail mass, so likely it was artifact noted on CT scan.
# Hypercalcemia: Pts calcium was elevated at 11-12.
Her HCTZ and calcium supplements were stopped.
PTH was checked and was low at 10.
She will need her calcium levels monitored and may require periodic pamidronate.
# Chronic aortic dissection: Noted on CT of the lungs with 'extensive calcifications of the aorta noted as well as areas of mural thrombus and potential focal area of small dissection at the level of the aortic arch'.
CTA was performed and showed no pulmonary artery abnormality.

Her PTT needs to be checked every 8 hours to make sure that the PTT is therapeutic.

You need to be on heparin drip until your INR (warfarin's blood thinning levels) are therapeutic (between 2 and 3).
