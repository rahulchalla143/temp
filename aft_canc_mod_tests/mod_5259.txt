While inpatient she had an MR spect which demonstrated an area of elevated choline /creatinine ratio of 2.6; elevated ratio of greater than 1.5 has been reported in tumors.
Differential including metastatic disease versus tumafective MS;  A lumbar puncture was done which was reportedly negative for any infection.
Neurosurgery saw the patient and thought a brain biopsy would be quite a high risk and could cause further motor deficits.
The patient was recommended to have a lexiscan myoview done as an outpatient.
Echo done demonstrated an EF of 60% and trace TR and PI.
