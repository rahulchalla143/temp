In the absence of air in small bowel an obstruction of fluid filled loops cannot be excluded, but could be evaluated with CT if warranted.

Also CT is less sensitive in the detection of early cerebral edema, for which clinical correlation reg.
Pt was d/c and went to [**Hospital **] rehab, but he became hypoxic to low 90s, with lower BP, febrile to 102.5, HR 160s incr from baseline 120s, along with n/v and abdominal pain.
Pt was weaned was off the vent and extubated [**5-26**].
The latest CT chest on [**6-27**] showed "Marked improvement in bibasilar consolidation, with mild residual RLL abnormality with impacted bronchi and peribronchial infiltration.
On [**6-22**] pt had CT Abd showing no acute intra-abdominal process.
Thus, we asked IR to perform a flow study to evaluate for impingement and patency (due to concurrent high-residuals from tube feeds - see below/next paragraph), and the study on [**6-26**] showed normal flow.
Pt's CXR/Chest CT did not show worsening of pneumonia, and actually showed mild improvement.
Pt was already anti-coagulated with Fondaparinox for a PE in [**2-3**] (attributed cause of his persistent tachycardia).
And pt already had a known history of cardiomyopathy with TTE on [**2170-4-17**] showing EF 45-50%, likely multifactorial- chemotherapy, radiation, GVHD, longstanding hypertension/tachycardia.
Patient was found to have a small consolidate on CXR and was started on Vancomycin for s. aureus pneumonia.
