His hematocrit trended from 39 -> 34 -> 29.
Pathology from the polypectomy revealed an adenoma with high grade dysplasia.
Repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**2141-5-15**] was completed which showed clot at site of prior polypectomy.
Follow up hematocrit on [**2141-5-15**] after the sigmoidoscopy was 29.
It was recommended that he stay one more night in the hospital to ensure that his hematocrit was stable and bleeding has stopped, but the patient elected to leave against medical advice.
We would like to monitor you further and check additional blood counts.
