PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, his vitals were:  Blood pressure 111/60.
Heart rate 80s.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.

In general, this is an 83-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy who presented in rapid atrial fibrillation, complicated by hypotension, requiring intubation, status post failed electrical cardioversion with spontaneous resolution to sinus rhythm and stabilization of heart rate and blood pressure on dopamine.
DIC panel was negative and he tolerated being extubated well.
However, at 9:45 a.m., the Medical Team was called to see the patient during rounds for rapid atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 150s-170s and systolic blood pressure of 110s requiring dopamine 10 mcg for support.
He was febrile with a temperature of 102.5.
While starting amiodarone drip, the patient became unresponsive with systolic blood pressure in the 90s to 100s.
The rhythm then converted to course of ventricular tachycardia with systolic blood pressures in the 30s.
