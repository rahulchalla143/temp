Chest CT from [**7-16**] had shown multiple "defined pulmonary nodules slightly improved".
His hematocrit was noted to have dropped from 25 to 18.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical exam at admission to the ICU: Vitals: Temperature 103.8.
Blood pressure 85/47.
Heart rate 110.
Respiratory rate 40.
LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 24.7 on admission, decreased to 18 in the setting of chest x-ray showing new prominent alveolar left lower lobe opacity.
ECG sinus tachycardia, rate 150's, normal axis, slightly peaked T-waves in V3 to V5.
The patient was presumed to have had an episode of acute respiratory distress with sudden onset requiring transfer to the intensive care unit, likely due to pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia with platelets less than 10.
Also Amicar was started for thrombocytopenia that was severe with a platelet level of 5.
A family meeting with palliative care and ICU team led to pursuit of comfort measures in light of futility of additional treatment, unable to maintain adequate levels of thrombocytes and blood cells with continuing pulmonary hemorrhage.
He was noted to be unresponsive and found to be breathless, pulseless and without heart tones, blood pressure or corneal reflexes.
