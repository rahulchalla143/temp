RUQ US ([**2176-12-18**]): 1) Patent left TIPS.
Chest CT ([**2176-10-31**]): 1.
Echo [**2176-12-21**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 60-70%).
Blood cx [**12-19**] and [**12-21**] pend Urine cx [**12-18**] neg   Brief Hospital Course: Brieflyl, this is a 53 yo M w/ h/o EtOH cirrhosis on the transplant list, chronic pancreatitis with DM, anemia, admitted w/ hypotension refractory to fluids, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia.
Initially it was felt that the most likely etiology of the pts hypotension was his cirrhosis, but possible other etiologies of acute change included distributive (septic), cardiogenic and hypovolemic.
There was initial suggestion of infection with CXR findings and lactate of 2.9, but the pt was afebrile with only mild nonproductive cough and good UOP.
A component of hypovolemia/dehydration was also suspected, supported by clinical exam and FeNa of 0.07%.
# PNA:  Given the pts new cough, elevated WBC, and CXR infiltrates, the pt was started on levofloxacin and flagyl IV on [**12-18**].
Identified on CT initially in [**12-12**].
The pts bilirubin was elevated throughout this admission (21 on admission, baseline 3)w/ no evidence of obstruction; but RUQ US did not have good view of CBD.
UNa was less than 10 with U osm 577 c/w low intravascular volume.
Diabetes: No prior h/o DM but presenting glucose >500, suspect due to chronic pancreatitis.
Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreased from baseline plt 70-100 ([**3-13**] cirrhosis) with no evidence of bleeding.
Anemia: Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
