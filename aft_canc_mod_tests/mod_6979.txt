At [**Hospital3 **] her HR was 150s in sinus tach, BP 110/70, RA sat 80s, her BNP was found to be 4,000 and her D-dimer was elevated so there was concern for PE vs. CHF vs. PNA.
At [**Hospital1 **] ED her vitals were HR 120s, BP 120/70, sat mid 80s RA, 95% on NRB, CXR showed LLL infiltrate, CTA done which showed no PE but revealed a probable LLL postobx PNA, lactate was 4.5.

Conclusions: Suboptimal images.The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function appears mildly depressed.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2179-6-9**], the LVEF is probably less.
If clincally indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast (Definity) may better characterize global/regional LV systolic funciton.

Eval for infiltrate - infection vs CHF  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old woman with metastatic ca, sats 80s RA, cough, elevated lactate.
COMPARISONS: Head CT of [**2181-1-25**], CT chest of [**2180-9-14**] and chest x-ray of the same day.
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT imaging through the chest with 80 mL of nonionic Optiray contrast per CTA PE protocol.
There is dense consolidation in the left lower lobe, new from the PET CT of [**2181-1-25**], demonstrating diffuse air bronchograms, likely representing postobstructive pneumonia rather thean lobar atelectasis.
Again demonstrated are multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum in the subcarinal, pretracheal, and AP window distribution.
