HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2163-3-30**], end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis since [**2164-5-29**]), renal cell carcinoma with positive metastases, type 2 diabetes, who presented to the Coronary Care Unit after an elective cardiac catheterization for preoperative evaluation for possible future nephrectomy after a Persantine MIBI in [**2164-4-29**] showed moderate partially reversible inferior and apical perfusion defects, mild partially reversible later wall defect, global hypokinesis, with an ejection fraction of 37%.
The patient had original cardiac catheterization in [**2163-3-1**] with subsequent coronary artery bypass graft in [**2163-3-30**] with saphenous vein grafts to left anterior descending artery, posterior descending artery, and diagonal with pericardiectomy.
The patient was preopped for possible future nephrectomy after a CT scan showed possible abdominal metastases.
He had a cardiac catheterization on [**8-17**] showing left main coronary artery disease diffusely at 30%, left anterior descending artery of 70% proximally, 50% mid, 80% large diagonal, 90% mid diagonal occlusions, and left circumflex 90% proximal, right coronary artery occluded proximally.
ALLERGIES:  Allergies include CT SCAN CONTRAST and MORPHINE.
Vital signs were pulse 70, blood pressure 118/57, pulse oximetry 99, respiratory rate 22.
HEENT revealed pupils were equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  He had a white blood cell count of 5, hematocrit of 28.5, platelets of 158.
Chem-7 revealed sodium of 131, potassium of 5, chloride 93, bicarbonate 20, BUN of 34, creatinine of 5.4, glucose of 186.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 73-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, type 2 diabetes, renal cell carcinoma with metastases, now status post cardiac catheterization, status post intermittent heart block.
His Coreg was titrated down to 6.25 mg p.o.
The patient ruled in for a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction status post catheterization on [**8-17**], with a creatine kinase of 407, and a MB of 76, with an index of 19.
On [**8-21**], the patient went for a follow-up cardiac catheterization where the proximal left anterior descending artery was stented, first obtuse marginal was stented, and rescue angioplasty was performed on the left circumflex.
Other impressions at this cardiac catheterization were 2-vessel coronary artery disease and severe pulmonary hypertension.
The patient also had an electrophysiology study for the 2:1 heart block which ended up being negative, and no pacemaker was installed.
Hematology revealed the patient continued to be anemic with hematocrits in the 28 to 30 range.
Iron studies were sent.
The patient had an iron of 25, a TIBC of 172, a ferritin of 323.
to good affect, and blood sugars remained in the 90 to 130 range.
Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.
