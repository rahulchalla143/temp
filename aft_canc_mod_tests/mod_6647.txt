MR of T spine was performed to evaluate LE weakness, without evidence of cord compression.
On arrival to the MICU, non-invasive ventilation was attempted but unsuccessful [**2-17**] facial structure.
Pertinent positives on discharge physical exam: Vitals: T: 98 HR 98 BP 110/80 RR 18 SpO2 97% RA -acromegaly, frontal bossing, enlarged hands/feet -sacral ulcer -portacath in place -asymmetric eyelids -CV: RRR, no m/r/g -PULM: CTAB -ABD: soft, NT, ND, +BS -Neuro: alert, oriented, conversational.
Pertinent Results: Labs on discharge: [**2144-11-12**]: WBC-1.0* RBC-2.74* Hgb-8.6* Hct-24.8* MCV-90 MCH-31.5 MCHC-34.8 RDW-16.9* Plt Ct-99* Neuts-57 Bands-0 Lymphs-29 Monos-7 Eos-7* Baso-0 Atyps-0 Metas-0 Myelos-0 Glucose-152* UreaN-8 Creat-0.4* Na-143 K-3.7 Cl-105 HCO3-29 AnGap-13 ALT-16 AST-11 LD(LDH)-147 AlkPhos-58 TotBili-0.2 Albumin-3.0* Calcium-9.1 Phos-4.4 Mg-1.9 UricAcd-2.6* .
[**2144-10-27**] CT torso w/contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**9-10**] MRI L-spine: IMPRESSION: Limited examination demonstrates markedly decreased bone marrow signal, likely relating to the patient's lymphoma.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2144-8-12**] atrial bigeminy is present.
Echo 7.30: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated on [**7-12**] in the setting of LLL PNA, lactic acidosis, and significant evidence of infiltrative malignant process on CT with peribronchial thickening.
PNEUMONIA/INFECTION: Initial CXR on [**7-12**] showed a LLL PNA.
Later CXRs showed a persistent infiltrate at the R base.
BAL grew mycoplasma hominis on [**7-19**] and sputum grew coag+ staph on [**7-23**].
EBV serum PCR was positive (level of 40).
CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx and EBV PCR were negative.
HIV, HBV, HCV, galactomannan, and B-glucan were negative as was evidence for acute CMV or HHV-6 infection.
Repeated surveillance cultures were negative.
TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME: Labs at admission were significant for elevated LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved to baseline after 1 week admission after 2 doses rasburicase.
Tumor lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**] with chemo and patient received 1 dose rasbiricase on [**7-24**].
Tumor lysis labs stabilized thereafter and UOP>100cc/hr and allopurinol was maintained.
BURKITT-LIKE HIGH GRADE LYMPHOMA: CT showed diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters, peribronchial.
MRI showed epidural enhancement in T-spine.
Future imaging should include gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the head to pursue possible radiation (pt's original complaints of CN V and VII palsies possibly related to lymphoma vs acromegaly).
Precipitous drop in WBC and platelets on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout most of admission.
Currently his counts are plts 99, HCT 24.8, WBC 1 with ANC 570.
Goal would be to keep HCT >25 and platelets >10 (transfuse as needed to meet these goals).
TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF and no evidence of heart failure.
Repeat EKGs showed frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia.
Patient's heart rate in high 90s, low 100s typically, even on low-dose metoprolol.
ABDOMINAL DISTENTION: Developed on [**7-19**] with hypoactive bowel sounds.
Patient continued to feel constipated but was having BM's - aggressive control of bowel regimen is required for patient comfort - through medications, ambulation, hydration.
HYPERGLYCEMIA: blood glucose in the 200-300s starting [**7-23**].
TSH, cortisol, FSH, LH were all normal.
Optho consult for visual field testing was suggested when patient stabilized/alert.
Cultures grew coag negative staph and mycelia sterilia.
Exam starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly on the left.
MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
Initial concern was for cord compression but neurosurgery had low suspicion and MRI was not initially repeated.
Repeat MRI of pituitary needed eventually for acromegaly work-up.
Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): Please hold for SBP <100 or HR<60.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Aggressive B Cell Lymphoma  Secondary: Left Lower Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis Exposure Keratitis R Eye Acromegaly   Discharge Condition: Stable.
You were intubated in the intensive care unit and a breathing machine continued to help you breath.
Repeat BM biopsy and repeat CT scan of the torso were negative for disease.
