Her exam was notable for decreased breath sounds on the right.
A chest X-ray confirmed the presence of a large pleural effusion and there was a question of an infiltrate and so the patient was given vanc/cefepime to cover HAP.
A bedside ultrasound revealed what appeared to be a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of RV collapse.
CT showed a moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites and enhancing nodularity within the peritoneal/omental fat consistent with carcinomatosis/omental caking.
On [**2167-12-23**] she underwent a thoracoscopy with pleurodesis, biopsy of the left parietal pleura and right percutaneous drainage of pleural effusion.
CT torso in [**6-3**] was notable for a right sided pleural effusion which was malignant based on cytology from thoracentesis on [**2169-7-28**].
She underwent talc pleurodesis on [**2170-1-10**].
CT on [**2170-2-14**] showed new mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy as well as markedly increased soft tissue thickening along the right pleura, extending into the anterior mediastinum.
She stopped after 7 cycles because her CA 125 rose and her CT was unchanged.
Her regimen was changed to Navelbine 30mg/m2 on D1 and D15 of a 28 day cycle and each dose is being followed with neulasta.
Her CA-125 decreased from 340 to 167 after 3 cycles, but then rose to 273 in early 3/[**2170**].
Vaginal biopsy on [**2171-2-21**] performed due to vaginal bleeding was notable for metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS  HISTORY: 57-year-old female with history of primary peritoneal carcinoma with metastasis to the pleura s/p pleurodesis, pericardium, and retroperitoneum.
CT torso dated [**2172-3-27**].
TECHNIQUE: CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed from the lung bases to the pelvis after administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
Hyperdense pleura appears stable and likely the sequelae of pleurodesis.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN FOLLOWING CONTRAST:  Liver enhances normally without focal masses.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Repear ECHo shows RV dilation concerning for possible PE that is new    since her last ECHO on [**5-28**] and prior CTA [**5-27**].
TECHNIQUE: CTA chest performed prior to and after IV contrast.
CTA CHEST:  FINDINGS: Evaluation of pulmonary arteries show tiny subsegmental pulmonary emboli identified in the left upper and left lower lobe, new since prior imaging.
There is a pericardial effusion, unchanged in appearance since prior radiograph and slightly enlarged compared to CT [**2172-5-27**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

ECHO [**6-2**] Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-5-28**], the right ventricle is now larger and more hypokinetic.
Pericardial fluid, cell block:              Scantly cellular preparation with rare atypical cells, (seen only on levels S7-S10.)
Note:  Most of the atypical cells show nuclear staining with WT-1 and cytoplasmic staining with cytokeratin AE1-3/CAM5.2.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2172-2-19**] and CT torso [**3-27**], [**2171**].
AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is increased opacification of the right hemithorax compared to the prior study with faint air bronchograms in the mid and lower right lung.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
COMPARISON: Comparison is made with a CT abdomen and pelvis of [**2172-6-4**].
The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the table.
Under [**Name (NI) 13416**], the right common femoral vein was punctured with a 19-gauge needle, through which [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava.
Needle was exchanged for an Omni Flush catheter, which was advanced to the confluence of the iliac veins.
Venogram was performed and demonstrated a single IVC with no filling defects in the infrarenal portion.
A fluoroscopic spot image was obtained and saved digitally.
IVC gram with no IVC duplication and no filling defects noted.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CXR [**2172-6-10**] IMPRESSIONS: Pleural effusions remain small.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
# Pericardial effusion: Large effusion seen on echo which was drained - 650cc bloody fluid; shortness of breath vastly improved following the dranaige in the ICU, and she was transferred to the OMED floor on [**5-29**] as a result.
Gram stain/cx of the fluid showed POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES and the fluid culture was negative for acid fast bacteria.
CT scan of chest [**5-27**]: the small size of the right atrium, if not due to hypovolemia, may indicate constrictive physiology.
Repeat Echo on [**6-2**] showed no significant reaccumulation of pericardial fluid, however showed right heart strain.
The follwing CT findings were seen on CT chest [**5-27**]: 1.
# AFib with RVR: The patient triggered on [**6-2**] for heart rate in the 160-170 and found to have atrial fibrillation.
# Anemia: Was transfused 2 units [**6-1**] in effort to increase hemoglobin in the setting of sinus tachycardia and blood clots per rectum.
# Bacteremia: The patient had gram positive cocci growing in clusters, coagulase negative which grew in her blood from culture sample taken from her port on [**6-2**].
bacteria coagulase negative from urine culture taken [**6-3**].
We took another blood sample from her port on [**6-4**], to reassess.
Subsequent cultures were negative and antibiotics were discontinued.
Several imaging studies showed fluid around your heart.
Radiographic imaging also showed fluid accumulating in your chest cavity, known as pleural effusions.
These fluid collections remained stable and were not thought to be contributing significantly to your shortness of breath because your symptoms improved after draining fluid from  around your heart.
Further radiographic imaging of your chest showed clots in both lungs.
To prevent further clots, you were started on an anticoagulation medication, but at a low dose because blood clots observed in your rectum raised concern for gastrointestinal bleeding.
This was done to prevent further clots from being pumped into your lungs.
During your hospitalization, you developed several bouts of rapid heart rate found to be caused by an irregular heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation.
Radiographic imaging showed no evidence of a complete bowel obstruction or evidence of a hole in your bowel, but did show that you were quite backed up with stool.
