He was alert and appropriate at the time of his physical exam and he did indeed exhibit memory loss both to recent and distant events.
VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate 66, blood pressure 166/89, respiratory rate 16, temperature 97.1??????
and O2 saturation was 98%.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Unremarkable.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no evidence of wheeze, rales, rhonchi or accessory muscle use.
The exam was severely limited due to fairly poor patient cooperation and compliance with instructions.
LABORATORY DATE AT THE TIME OF INITIAL ASSESSMENT AT [**Hospital6 **] ON [**1-17**]:  Essentially within normal limits and he was seen at the [**Hospital6 2561**] in consultation by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 6910**] who made arrangements for the patient to be transferred and admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for a craniotomy on the [**1-20**].
The patient had undergone an MRI prior to transfer from the [**Hospital3 **].
An MRI showed heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the left posterior frontal parietal lobe with a smaller satellite nodule at the left periatrial location abutting the left lateral ventricle.
A repeat head CT scan on the [**1-24**] showed a small amount of blood products in the area of the tumor bed and cavity of the tumor with some mild residual ring enhancement.
His oxygen saturation at the time was 91% to 94%.
He was placed supine and quickly became more responsive with the oxygen saturation returning to 98% to 99%.
An electrocardiogram was done which showed T-wave inversions in lead AVL.
A head CT was obtained, but showed no change in the tumor bed or condition of the brain and the patient became much more responsive later in the day and remained stable.
He was seen in consultation in the x-ray therapy department on the [**1-31**] for evaluation and initial planning and measurements for planned external beam radiotherapy to be begun in an outpatient manner.
Pupils 3 mm, bilaterally reactive to 2 mm.
Lopressor 50 mg per PEG tube or po bid, but hold Lopressor if systolic blood pressure less than 110 or heart rate less than 60.
He was also discharged on tube feedings to include ProMod with 5 or 75 cc per hour per the PEG tube  Treatment frequencies at the rehabilitation center were to consist of aggressive physical therapy and occupational therapy, as well as outpatient x-ray therapy to be done at the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital.
