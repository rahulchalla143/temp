MRI head negative for CPM.
EEG negative for sz.
CT abd found mass c/w renal cell CA, needs workup (onc has not yet been consulted).
On the floor, the patient was hypertensive to 180 SBP and was given Hydral IV 10mg x 1.
Past Medical History: Schizophrenia diagnosed at age 17 Lithium toxicity in [**2189**] left ventricular outflow obstruction EF >55% HTN  Social History: lives in group home, occasional alcohol, (+) tobacco, no intravenous drug use.

[**11-11**] CT C-spine: 1.
[**11-11**] CT Maxillary sinus: 1.
An air-filled level could suggest acute sinusitis.
CT head: 1.
As this study was performed without IV contrast, either a dedicated CT urogram or MRI is recommended to further assess.
Very limited study for assessing for any other potential lesions or metastases without IV or oral contrast.
There is mild sulcal prominence as noted on the prior examination of [**2190-8-4**].
# Hyponatremia - From psychogenic polydipsia.
MRI was negative for this but did show a question of stable communicating hydrocephalus.
Sodium was monitored closely and fluid restriction was discontinued.
It was likely that his hypotension was [**1-17**] both volume depletion, sepsis, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
As his blood pressure improved with IVF beta blockers were started to prolong filling time and improve his cardiac output from his HOCM.
Given that no gram negative rods were present on sputum culture or gram stain, a total of 8 days would be sufficient.
EEG ruled out seizure acitvity.
MRI did not show any evidence of stroke or anoxic brain injury.
His SBP was well controlled, and eventually, we d/c'd the captopril as he was only about 100's systolic with a rising creatinine.
It was explained to him that the findings on the CT scan showed a mass in the kidney and that it was suspicious for cancer and further, if it's not definitively diagnosed and treated, that it could spread and he could die.
K was 3.7 which was repleted.
EKG showed normal QT interval.
# Renal failure: Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted with a Cr of 1.1 and had a Uprot/Cr ratio of 1.2 indicating likely chronic renal disease.
His creatinine has trended up to 2.0, necessitating discontinuation of ACEI.
It was recommended for you to receive MRI/MRA here for definitive diagnosis, as this mass was very concerning for renal cell carcinoma, but you have refused this work-up, with the understanding that if this is cancer, it may spread and even result in death if not evaluated and treated appropriately.
