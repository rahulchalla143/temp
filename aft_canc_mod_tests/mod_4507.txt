ECHO [**2164-6-18**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left lower extremity ultrasound [**2164-6-18**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
CT CHEST [**2164-7-12**]: Right PICC line tip is in the proximal right atrium.
Right upper lobe consolidation seen on the prior CT and radiographs has significantly progressed since the prior study, currently involving the apical posterior aspect of the right upper lobe as well as superior aspect of right lower lobe.
TTE [**2164-7-13**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-6-18**], the heart rate and estimated pulmonary artery pressures are higher.
CT Torso [**2164-7-19**] Impression: 1.
CT Chest [**2164-7-30**] As compared to the prior CT torso from [**2164-7-19**], there is significant interval improvement in the right upper lobe consolidation and left lower lobe consolidation with improved aeration of both lobes.

# AML: Patient presented for evaluation of cellulitis and was found to have WBC 22 with 85% blasts.
He underwent bone marrow biopsy [**6-27**] which showed new acute leukemia, AML-M2 with cytogenetics carrying translocations at ETO at 8q21 which is considered a to be a good prognostic indicator.
Baseline ECHO showed mild MR and was otherwise unremarkable.
Day 14 bone marrow biopsy was hypocellular consistent with ablated marrow.
His recovery bone marrow biopsy done on day 37 also showed complete remission.
# Pneumonia: Patient developed productive cough [**7-8**] in the setting of neutropenic fever, a CT chest showed a right upper lobe round infiltrate with surrounding ground glass opacities (halo sign).
He underwent broncheoalveolar lavage which revealed purulent material in the right upper lobe, cultures were taken which was unrevealing.
He developed hypoxia and tachypenia and repeat CT showed progression of the previously seen right upper lobe infiltrate.
Repeat imaging showed worsening of his right upper lobe pneumonia, with opacities extending throughout the right hemithorax.
The repeat Chest CT on [**2164-7-30**] showed significant improvement of pneumonia, but still significant consolidation of R lung and pulmonary nodules, likely infectious.
C. diff PCR was ordered for more definitive diagnosis, but he has not had BM.
While likely septic, his pressure improved with sedation weaning, suggesting a substantial iatrogenic source.
He was eventually extubated, and his SBP remained in 110-130s on the floor.
Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
You developed neutropenia (low white cell counts) with chemotherapy and had fevers, for which you received antibiotics and had CT scan of your chest.
CT scan of your chest showed pneumonia (infection of lungs) in your right lung, which was treated with antifungal medications.
