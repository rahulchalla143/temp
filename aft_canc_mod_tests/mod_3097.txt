According to the patient, he initially presented to an outside hospital and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which observed distal esophageal bleeding at 28 to 30 cm and was injected with epinephrine.
It was subsequently re-evaluated with an EGD which showed no bleed.
Initially, his hematocrit at that time was 21 and he had been transfused with four units of packed red blood cells.
The patient was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for definitive evaluation of this tumor with a possibility of operative intervention.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], the patient's white blood cell count was 14.1 with a hematocrit of 34.8 and platelet count of 171,000 with a prothrombin time of 13, partial thromboplastin time 22.5 and INR of 1.1.
His admission potassium was 3 (which was subsequently repleted) with a BUN and creatinine of 31 and 0.7.
Liver function tests were within normal limits with an ALT of 12, AST 17, alkaline phosphatase 47, and total bilirubin 0.5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient had a temperature of 97.8 with a pulse of 69 which was regular, with a blood pressure of 130/60, respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 99% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Unremarkable, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally and symmetric.
Extremities:  Warm and well perfused with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses, no notable clubbing or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and initially underwent a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis in order to assess for the extent of the lesion and also possible metastatic disease if this was, in fact, a cancer.
Notably, the CT scan showed thickening of the mid-esophagus which likely corresponded to the known esophageal mass.
Subsequent to this evaluation by cardiothoracic surgery, the patient underwent a bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy to evaluate the extent of disease and also to determine what treatment options the patient could undergo.
On postprocedure day one, the patient was scheduled to have a clinic visit for further evaluation of this and we will schedule him for an outpatient PET CT scan for evaluation for metastatic disease.
He has been ambulating and maintaining good oxygen saturations in the 90% range.
His discharge hematocrit is 36.6 with a white blood cell count of 11.4 and platelet count 203,000.
