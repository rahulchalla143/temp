At OSH labs notable for WBC 60 with 80% blasts, Hct 12.
CXR with R sided infiltrate, noncontrast Head CT normal.
Of note, pt had recent a recent work-up in [**Month (only) **]/[**Month (only) **] for weightloss (~30lbs over past year) which included labs notable only for anemia and CT Abd which per husband "showed pancreatitis."

She spiked a temperature to 104 the first night, but all cultures failed to grow.
Her chest x-ray showed progression of the infiltrate and she wae re-intubated, primarily for bronchoscopy.
After 2 weeks on steroids repeat CXR should slight improvement of diffuse infiltrates.
Two felx bronchs were done which could not identify a focal source for the bleeding.
CXR during this period showed persistent signs of ARDS with no improvement in lungs on CXR.
The patient had increasing respiratory distress from [**2183-2-8**] onward and became increasingly difficult to ventilate with worseining CXR on full coverage of antimicrobial agents.
DIC and tumor lysis labs were followed every six hours but remained negative.
More definitive chemotherapy was initially put on hold given her poor respiratory function/infection (as described below) and her initial echo with and EF of 30%.
She was transfused multiple times to keep her Plt > 10 and Hct > 20, eventually having a minimal response to transfusions.
DAT was positive for anti-SDH, which according to the blood bank, was not enough to account for what would have been the degree of hemolysis needed for the lack of response.
Thus it was decided to re check a bone marrow biopsy to determine if the patient had AML or more of a MDS picture.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated 20% blasts indicative of AML.
After being non-neutropenic for 7 days or so her counts began to drop at which point it was discovered she had VRE and MRSA bactermia.
Anisochoria -- Noted on the first morning of admission, the patient's anisochoria manifested as a dilated right pupil that was sluggishly reactive as compared to a smaller, reactive left pupil.
A stat head CT was obtained without obvious abnormalities and neurology was consulted.
An MRI additionally failed to provide and explanation, and ultimately, it was felt that this was due to the disease process, possibly a leukemic infiltrate.
On CT she was also noted to have splenic infarcts; however, her other respiratory and infectious problems prevented any further workup for possible infiltrative disease.
Her LFT's remained stable but elevated, and CT showed liver disease, which would have required MRI or biopsy; however, other clinical problems prevented further workup.
RUQ uUS showed no evidence of cholecystitis but she did have a thickened GB fundus indicative of possible adenomyomatosis.
Otherwise she had no specific abd complaints and her labs were followed.
She underwent several BALs during the admission, which were all negative for everything except influenza A--the final one was negative for the flu.
Blood cultures from her RSC line grew VRE, for which she was treated with 14 days of daptomycin.
Her counts gradually came up and she remained afebrile.
Then her counts dropped again and she developed fevers.
Bld cultures initially grew out VRE.
Galactomannan was sent and was pending.
Echo initially showed decreased EF, which gradually became hyperdynamic as she continued to be septic.
Even with her bacteremia her BP remained in the 100's.
There was concern for CVA so MRI was done which was negative for stroke.
As described above she had MRI which showed evidence of two areas of ischemia in the brain.
Lumbar puncture was done to rule out malignant involvement.
EMG and nerve conduction studies showed severe ICU myopathy and polyneuropathy.
