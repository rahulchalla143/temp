Of note, MRI had shown bilateral cortical DWI abnormalities thought to be due to hepatic disease vs seizure; these had resolved on repeat MRI one week later.
Past Medical History: DM HTN NASH cirrhosis, on transplant list seizures as above hypothyroidism GERD   Social History: lives with wife, remote smoking history, no EtOH or drug use   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.9, HR 84, BP 152/74, RR 14, SaO2 98%/RA, FS 187 Genl: lying on side, moving purposefully, appears to be seizing (see below) CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no m/r/g Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly Abd: soft, NT, BS+ Ext: warm and dry  Neurologic examination: Pt is lying on side, with head and eyes deviated far to the right, and right beating nystagmus.
Motor: hypertonic throughout, no jerking of limbs, moves all extremities antigravity to noxious Sensory: responds to noxious throughout   Pertinent Results: Studies: CT - head - [**2198-8-2**] IMPRESSION: 1.
EEG - [**2198-8-2**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of frequent sharp and sharp and slow wave discharges arising from the left posterior quadrant with maximal frequency of about 1 per Hz in the setting of brief episodes of theta frequency slowing seen in the same region.
The findings suggest an area of cortical and subcortical  dysfunction along with cortical irritability which may serve as a focus for potential seizure activity.
EEG - [**2198-8-5**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured five pushbutton activations.
EEG - [**2198-8-6**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured one pushbutton activation.
Routine sampling and spike and seizure detection programs demonstrated several episodes of rhythmic 8 Hz monomorphic blunted sharp wave discharges occurring in a generalized distribution.
Limited evaluation secondary to lack of intravenous contrast administration.
No evidence of acute abdominal or pelvic pathology within the limitations described.\  CT torso - [**2198-10-23**] " CHEST: The patient is status post tracheostomy tube placement, with the tip terminating at the level of thoracic inlet.
Small pericardial nodes are noted; however, measure less than 5 mm.
Enlarged porta hepatis and peripancreatic nodes, unchanged.
CT-head - [**2198-8-7**] IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation secondary to artifact from overlying metallic devices.
NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW: The study is markedly limited for the evaluation of brain parencyma due to streak artifacts from the several external metallic objects.
EEG - [**2198-8-8**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling and spike and seizure detection programs showed bursts of sharply contoured waveforms occurring in a generalized distribution but also with a leftsided predominance lasting up to one to two seconds in duration and admixed with other periods of voltage suppressed background lasting, at times, up to 10-20 seconds.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-3-29**], regional LV wall motion abnormalities are new, and consequently, LV systolic function is now depressed.
[**2198-8-15**] head MRI with and without contrast.
Particularly in view of the history of status epilepticus, it is of some interest that the present diffusion scan is normal, whereas as a diffusion imaging study from [**2197-12-15**], showed very extensive areas of signal abnormality.
[**2198-10-12**] head MRI with and without contrast.
This may represent sinusitis or post intubation changes  [**2198-10-26**] Most recent labs - see attached printout.
Routine portable EEG showed frequent and at times periodic lateralized discharges from the left posterior quadrant.
At that time his exam revealed staring spells with confusion most of the time - excluding an episode of lucidity.
Continuous EEG was set up and revealed non-convulsive status epilepticus.
EEG on [**2198-8-6**] continued to demonstrate isolated occipitally predominant and leftsided predominant spike and wave discharges despite this heavy dose of antiseizure medication.
A CT of the abdomen failed reveal a nidus of infection, though the study was limited due to the lack of contrast.
Blood cultures from [**2198-8-7**] grew coag negative staph and vancomycin sensitive enterococcus.
An EEG on [**2198-8-8**] was read by the covering resident as suggestive of insufficient burst suppression and the patient was given a 400mg IV dilantin bolus.
A STAT echo showed hypokinesis of the anterior septum, akinesis of the inferior septum, and severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
By [**2198-8-10**] pressors were weened off and Zosyn was stopped.
An MRI failed to detect any significant abnormality or change from prior.
It was suggested that this was due to trauma from his Foley, and a repeat U/A and UCx were stable.
His Keppra was maintained at 2250 mg [**Hospital1 **], and his Dilantin at 300 mg TID, the latter with corrected (for low albumin) levels around 30. .
Of note, a repeat MRI of the brain on [**10-15**] showed no ischemic changes.
His reflexes were absent, supporting this finding.
Metoprolol dose was halved with improvement in his BPs with stable bps on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] and lisinopril.
His VRE (rectal swab) showed sparse growth on [**10-13**].
His Vancomycin was discontinued, and he remained afebrile.
A chest CT done just prior to discharge showed "decreased parenchymal opacities in both lower lobes with residual atelectasis and effusion.
Towards the end of his stay, an U/S of his abdomen, a bone-scan and CT torso were obtained - see below.
He had a Dobhoff in place fo several weeks, and an assessment of the amount of ascitis by U/S on [**10-22**] showed no intra-abdominal ascites, making PEG placement possible.
His Dobhoff tip was found to be intragastric, and when pushed down further it only resulted in curlingup in the back of his mouth.
After withdrawing again, a repeat CXR on [**10-24**] showed the tip to be in the stomach still.
To assess overall prognosis (re: PEG placement) a bone-scan and CT torso (post-RFA protocol) were obtained on [**10-23**], which showed extensive degenerative joint disease but no progression of his HCC (see details in results-section).
TSH and T4's were checked regularly.
Heme: All lineages decreasing on [**10-5**], hematology was consulted, iron and vitamin studies were normal.
Of note however, his pain seemed to be exacerbated when his joints were passively moved, ranging from smaller joints in the hand to larger joints as elbow.
His bone scan, done to assess for bony metastasis of his HCC, showed diffusely symmetric increased uptake of tracer in all joints, indicating degenerative disease.
However, if the patient is further mobilized, and this continues to be a problem, pain medication should be adapted and a further workup is warranted.
She continued to be understanding, and slowly appeared to accept the persistent vegetative state her husband was in, with no improvement of his neurological exam during the 2nd to last  month of his stay.
