A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show normal tracer distribution.
Dynamic blood pool images show tracer activity in the ileocolic artery distribution, suggesting active bleeding, first seen at 75 minutes with progressive accumulation of tracer in this locale until 90 minutes.
However, correlation with colonoscopy is recommended.
On [**3-11**] she continued to drop her hematocrit gradually and a bleeding scan was ordered.
The patient underwent a follow-up arteriogram which was negative.
A mesenteric lymph node was harvested for intraoperative frozen section and this was unrevealing of carcinoma.
Sponge count was correct and the abdomen was closed with running suture.
Estimated blood loss was 20 ml, and sponge, needle and instrument counts were reported to be correct x2.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 102456**] was admitted to the TSICU for serial hematocrits and hemodynamic monitoring.
Her hematocrit started at 41 and quickly fell to 25.
Of note, her WBC count at admission was 95.
Given her cardiac history and active bleeding she was transfused to maintain a hematocrit above 30.
A tagged red blood scan was done on [**3-11**] which showed a slow bleed in the RLQ at 75 minutes.
As this was felt to be fairly nonspecific and she continued to have blood bowel movements with drops in her hematocrit, an angiogram was done on [**3-12**].
The angiogram however did not show an active bleed.
In consultation with the gastroenterologists, we planned for a colonoscopy on [**3-13**] in hopes of identifying the location of the bleed.
In the am of [**3-13**] her hematocrit had dropped to 22 and at this point she had required a total of 14 units of blood.
Her blood counts remained stable at 31.
She was noted to have runs of PSVT which continued up to discharge, but she was asymptomatic and her electrolytes were normal.
On POD#2 her hematocrit remained stable and she was started on subcutaneous heparin for DVt prophylaxis.
She had a large bloody bowel movement but her hematocrit remained stable at 31.
A KUB was done as she continued to have nausea which was unremarkable.
Your blood counts were stable afterwards.
