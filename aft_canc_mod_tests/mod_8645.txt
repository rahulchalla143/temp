The procedure included plastic surgery for a component separation and ob/gyn for a total abdominal hysterectomy (reader referred to the respective Operative Notes for details).
Lower extremity dopplers did not show evidence of DVTs.
UA, UCx, CXR ordered (all negative for infectious process) and the foley catheter was removed.
On POD 9, Ms. [**Known lastname **], who was afebrile and not in respiratory distress, had CT angio which was positive for multifocal bilateral pulmonary emboli.
She was started on a heparin drip at 9300 units initial bolus and 2100/hr which was adjusted over the next two days from supratherapeutic (PTT>150) to therapeutic PTT (67.3) at a rate of 1200 units/hr on POD 10.
Her INR level went from 1.4 (POD 9) to 1.9 (POD 12) to 2.3 (POD 13) to 2.9 (POD 14, day of discharge).
During her stay, her electrolytes were carefully monitored and repleted as necessary.
Bladder pressures remained in the low twenties and transitioned to the high teens during POD 1 and 2 and to the mid-teens therafter.
On POD 2, in response to Hct in the low twenties compared to 31.8 pre-op, she was transfused with one unit PRBCs.
Hct responded to the low thirties.
On discharge, her Hct was 29.9.
CXR done on POD 7 showed ambiguous opacities in the left lobe consistent with atelectasis but unable to rule out pulmonary infection.
This remained largely unimproved on POD 9 when her WBC count was 17.1.
Her white count was trending down on discharge, from 15.4 (POD 12), 11.4 (POD 13) and 10.0 (day of discharge, POD 14).
Output gradually decreased throughout her stay after several days of decreasing output and 0 ml during POD 13, the JP right-sided [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was removed.
On day of discharge, patient was afebrile, vital signs stable, ambulating, tolerating PO, at therapeutic INR and plans for follow up.
Please ensure that you follow up with your Primary Care Physician three days after discharge to monitor INR levels and to set up a regular schedule for this to occur.
If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for bleeding problems.
Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood test that is right for you.
The blood test used for monitoring is called an INR.
