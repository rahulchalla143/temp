(Her platelet count was 58 on [**2133-8-20**] and 40 on [**2133-8-28**].)
She received platelet transfusion and underwent a bone marrow biopsy that reported showed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her initial vitals were T 97, BP 148/73, HR 79, O2 sat 96% on RA.
Exam revealed LUQ tenderness.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2133-10-2**] 12:49 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2133-9-15**] at 2:44:28 PM Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-9-5**], the overall findings are similar.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2133-10-7**] at 12:59:15 PM The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Right ventricular function cannot be assessed due to limited image quality.
Echo could not r/o RV strain.
Her HR improved with initiation of amiodarone and esmolol gtt, and her SBP improved with better HR control.
Her proBNP was found to be elevated and exam showed peripheral edema, suggesting CHF exacerbation in the setting of recent AF with [**Last Name (LF) 5509**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was given lasix 10 mg and 40 mg while in the ICU.
#ALL: On arrival, the patient had a CXR that showed no intrathroacic pathology, a splenic ultrasound that showed a mildly enlarged spleen with no intrasplenic abnormalities, an ECHO that showed an EF of 55%; the patient subsequently udnerwent a procedure for central line placement.
CT scan of the chest showed a new lung nodule.
Her antibiotic coverage was broadened to include vancomycin, cefepime, voriconazole, bactrim ppx, and on [**2050-10-5**], levofloxacin and metronidazole were added.
# Hypotension: On [**10-5**] she was hypotensive in the morning and was found to have blood pressures in the 90's systolic.
She was unable to get a chest CTA because of worsening creatinine to 1.9.
She was transferred to the unit for further management, and an echo showed massive dilation of the right atrium, in an otherwise difficult to asses echo.
Her BNP was checked and it was >10K suggesting new heart failure.
Her dilated right atrium on echo is a likely source of the a-fib.
She was loaded with amiodarone drip and put on an esmolol drip to control her rate and rhythm.
Her heart rate was moderately controlled on this regimen.
# Acute renal failure: Her creatinine began to climb starting on [**2133-10-5**] and was 3.7 the last lab check.
We stopped lab draws and vital signs, and tried to the best of our abilities to transition her to hospice care at home.
You were treated with chemotherapy, and your blood counts responded.
