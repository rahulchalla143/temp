He had a bone marrow biopsy performed on that day as well.
The bone marrow biopsy is pending at this time.
In the ED, his initial VS were 99.2, HR 121 BP 126/78 RR 16 100% on RA.
He was given Morphine 8 mg iv and dilaudid 8mg iv for pain control and became hypotensive with VS 116, 78/44 while in the ED.
Examination of the marrow demonstrated nearly 100%blasts, and cytogenetic examination showed t9;22 and q341.-q11.2.
-[**Date range (1) 46485**] -- Marrow bx indicated remission -[**7-23**] -- Pt developed petechiae, WBC found to be 18.4, platelets  of 19, 18%blasts, and a marrow bx indicated ALL recurrence.
-[**2171-8-29**] -- A repeat marrow bx indicated residual leukemia, though improved from previous.
-[**2171-9-4**] -- Pt underwent donor lymphocyte infusion -[**2171-10-14**] -- Marrow biopsy shows leukemia with 80% involvement,  and pt is admitted for hyperCVAD, discharged [**10-17**].

A cortasyn stim test was performed and he was seen to respond, so we discontinued fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone.
Chest CT revealed no nodular infection but a RLL infiltrate concerning for CAP and on HD2 was started on levofloxacin.
Vancomycin was changed to daptomycin which was stopped [**4-21**] given blood cultures remained negative x 48 hours.
Infectious workup in looking for source of sepsis included urine, blood and sputum culture, fungal , AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**], mycoplasma, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**] urine Ag, galatomannan all of which were negative.
Pt's LFT's continued to rise off of the vancomycin so the levofloxacin was changed to azithromycin which he completed a 10 day course of.
Skin biopsy showed complete separation of dermis and epidermis consistent with drug rash.
Alkaline phosphatase continued to rise despite rash improving so then arose concern for GVHD as had occured in the past.
Biopsy revealed diffuse biliary destruction consistent with GVHD although it was unclear if this was old or new.
He was continued on immunosuppressive therapy as above and on [**5-3**] was feeling well so plan was made for further workup and treatment of elevated LFT's as an outpt.
#Chest/Neck pain: T wave changes on EKG were non-diagnostic.
It didn't appear to be due to ischemia given he was ruled out for MI with serial enzymes and had no events on telemetry.
CTA showed no PE/aortic dissection.
Hemolysis labs were negative     Medications on Admission: Acyclovir 400 mg po bid (For Zoster ppx) Voriconazole 200 mg po bid (unable to fill for last three days)  Imipenenem 500mg q 6 hour Aerosolized pentamidine qmonth (For PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] last dose4/19) Diphenhydramine prn Oxycodone SR 60 mg po bid Oxycodone 5-10 mg po q6h breakthrough Lorazepam 2 mg po q4-6h prn   Discharge Medications: 1.
