GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-3-16**], the regurgitant native mitral valve has been treated with an annuloplasty.
Electronically signed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 171**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2133-3-26**] 18   Brief Hospital Course: In ED, Vitals T 96.0, H 86, BP 154/108, RR 34, O2 Sat 84 nrb.
CXR showed new pulmonary edema.
An EKG showed lateral STD in the setting of hypertensive emergency.
She has remained afebrile and without focal signs of infection although yesterday pm had a rise in WBC to 16  Labs on presentation also notable for an INR of 4 on presentation, coumadin was held.
Pt was kept there for 2 days while waiting for INR to drift down and giving vit K for this so she could proceed to cardiac catheterization (She has history of Afib on coumadin) She was found to have 3VD on cath on [**2133-3-19**] (70% LAD, 90% LCx, 60% RCA) --> therefore the plan was for CABG the following monday with possble mitral valve replacement given significant MR.
Although echo with EF>55%, RHC showed average wedge pressures about 30.
Her aorta pressures were elevated to 180's at the time of cath and she developed flash pulmonary edema and SOB.
Workup for CABG was completed wiht carotid u/s without stenosis, vein mapping performed and lesser saph identified, LFTs WNL, albumin WNL, HbA1c WNL, Dental constult ok.  On [**3-21**] pt became dehydrated and orthostatic, feeling lightheaded and with a vagal response when standing up.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for temperature >38.0.
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO ONCE (Once) for 1 days: check INR [**2133-4-1**].
