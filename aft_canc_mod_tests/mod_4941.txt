The CP was [**2-21**], lasted for a few minutes, and did not radiate.
On exam found to have a palpable mass in that area.
EKG showed sinus brady at 55bpm with no ischemic changes with possible peaked T waves.
Labs were significant for acute on chronic renal failure (cr 5.2), hyperkalemia to 5.6, and bicarb of 14, with AG of 15.
First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
HCT noted to be 22.5.
Guaiac negative on exam.
CXR was clear.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was performed to evaluate his palpable abdominal mass.
Most recent VS: 96.9 56 166/81 15 98%RA.
Review of systems reveals that he was a performance status 0 until the past month when he has been experiencing a cough, weakness, fatigue, and night sweats.
His ileostomy stoma was working well, draining clear urine.
He has noted some intermittent right flank discomfort this prompted an outpatient workup where he was diagnosed with a soft tissue obstruction of his mid ureter consistent with possible ureteral mass or TCC, with his baseline creatinine 1.2 becoming elevated to 3.3 as of last week.
He has also noted a cough for the past month, which has been nonproductive and a chest x-ray last week by history was negative.
Right hydro, progressive renal failure, creatinine 1.2-->3.2 in [**11-20**], CT scan [**10-21**]; 8 mm soft tissue obstruction in the mid right ureter.

CT Abdomen ([**2167-12-18**]): IMPRESSION:  1.
CT Chest ([**2167-12-22**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of lung metastasis.
In [**2167-10-13**], patient was diagnosed with cystic cancer; his left kidney, left ureter, entire bladder, and prostate were removed, and an ileal conduit was created and connected to right ureter.
At the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] as an outpatient, who recommended that given the above imaging, the patient should undergo restaging of his disease with Bone Scan and CT Chest.
He was ruled out for MI (CE negative X 3, normal EKG); however, he was noted to have creatinine of 5.2 during this event and consequently extended his stay in the ICU for management of ARF.
A CT without contrast of abdomen suggested that his ileal conduit was dilated and also contributing to a peristomal hernia (thought to be contributing to the cause of the ARF); hydronephrosis of right kidney was also noted.
A KUB and subsequent CT scan with contrast on [**2167-12-18**] demonstrated a true small-bowel obstruction secondary to a peristomal hernia (with the consequent inference that the original CT on [**12-15**] was demonstrating a true SBO as opposed to the ileal conduit contributing to the parastomal hernia).
The patient's ileal conduit  was felt to be obstructed (and consequently, the urine ostomy output was obstructed) by proximal dilated loops of small bowel.
The patient's creatinine continued to trend down throughout the rest of his admission (4.9 -> 1.7).
The patient's abdominal distension and pain markedly improved, and the patient began to pass flatus and bowel movements.
We corrected his hypernatremia by giving the patient freewater with D5 water.
Concerning the patient's metastatic disease, a bone scan on [**2167-12-17**] noted radiotracer uptake was concerning for new metastases.
Calcium  Oral   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Community health and hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Small Bowel Obstruction Secondary: 1) Acute Renal Failure 2) Atypical Chest Pain 3) Prior PE s/p IVF placement, on anticoagulation 4) Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pain during a blood transfusion; we ruled out the possibility you were having a heart attack.
You should have an INR checked on Friday ([**12-25**]) and should talk to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 84403**] about your Coumadin dose then.
