Intervals: PR 122 QRS 84 QT/QTc 384/427 Axis: P 71 QRS 49 T -60  CXR [**2145-6-27**]: There is no radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
MRCP [**2145-7-1**]: 1)  There is an enhancing 1.5 cm mass in the right lateral aspect of the ampulla, which only obstructs the common bile duct.
Aspiration/Food impaction: Patient underwent EGD x 2  on [**6-28**] with removal of 20 cm of lodged undigested food.
Initial EGD removed the first 15 cm.
This study showed a narrowed esophagus with non-distensibility.
Patient underwent a speech and swallow evaluation with no evidence of aspiration with any food consistency consistent with normal oropharyngeal function.
The patient underwent a repeat EGD on [**2145-7-5**] which showed normal esophageal mucosa and no evidence of constriction, therefore dilation was not performed.
If, however, the mass were an adenoma, then the patient could undergo a local resection.
His peak bilirubin was 5.2 with a direct bilirubin of 3.2.
ALT was 124, AST 115, Alkaline phosphatase peaked at 857.
His bilirubin was already trending down at the time of discharge.
Beta blocker was titrated up to Toprol XL 37.5 qd for better blood pressure and heart rate control.
Urinary tract infection: Patient's urine culture initially grew coagulase negative staph.
However, repeat urine culture was negative so this was thought to be a contaminant.
An MRI of the C spine was obtained which showed mild degenerative disease at multiple levels.
Vitamin C 11.
