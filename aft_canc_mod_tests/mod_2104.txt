CT angiogram at outside hospital demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.
Incidentally, CT scan for abdominal aortic aneurysm.
On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient was on 100% facial nonrebreather and oxygen saturation of 96% and respiratory rate of 20.
He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation and treatment of his pulmonary emboli.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 97.8, heart rate 84, blood pressure 115/68, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 96% on 100% nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The patient had anicteric sclera.
Lung examination - The patient had breath sounds bilaterally with faint crackles at the bases, expiratory wheezing throughout, no dullness to percussion.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, sodium was 137, potassium 5.4, chloride 100, bicarbonate 24, blood urea nitrogen 29, creatinine 1.4 which was up from the patient's baseline of 0.9 to 1.0, glucose 100, calcium 8.3, magnesium 2.3, phosphate 4.2.
White blood cell count was 8.3, normal differential, hematocrit 31.1.
Prothrombin time was 12.3 and INR was 1.1.
First arterial blood gases done on 100% nonrebreather had a pH of 7.42, pCO2 39 and pO2 of 92.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with normal axis and first degree AV block.
CT from the outside hospital was reviewed here and showed multiple filling defects in branches of the left and right pulmonary arteries and small bilateral pleural effusions that had been present post coronary artery bypass graft.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 79 year old male who developed dyspnea and hypoxia in coronary artery bypass graft postoperative period with CT scan that was positive for multiple pulmonary emboli.
The patient continued to have expiratory wheezing bilaterally in his lung fields throughout the course of his admission and it was felt that given the patient's long smoking history and chest x-ray with flattened diaphragms that he probably had some element of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Cardiac Function - The patient's preoperative echocardiogram had showed a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%.
His FENA was 0.49% as the patient was felt to be prerenal and volume depleted.
His creatinine returned to baseline with gentle fluid boluses over the days following admission.
The patient's urine output was initially monitored with a Foley.
Straight catheterization produced 1900 cc of discolored urine.
Urinalysis was sent which showed many bacteria, [**4-16**] white blood cells and for this, the patient was started on Ciprofloxacin to treat urinary tract infection.
Oncology - The patient was seen by oral head and neck surgery service here while he was in house for evaluation of the squamous cell cancer on his lip.
Surveillance head and neck CT scan done while the patient was in house in addition to the ulcerative lesion on his lip two submandibular lymph nodes that were enlarged probably representing metastases but no erosion into the bony structures of the calvarium.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm - The patient was evaluated by vascular surgery while in house who declined intervention at this point as well given the [**Hospital 228**] medical issues.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient's albumin on admission was 2.4 indicating severe malnourishment.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1159**].
titrated to an INR of greater than 2.0.
