The max transaortic velocity was 2.1 and with double envelope technique, the [**Location (un) 109**] was 1.6.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The max transaortic velocity was 2.1 and the [**Location (un) 109**] was 1.6 with continuity or planimetry.
LVEF 45 to 50% on epinephrin 0.02mc/kg/min.
[**Location (un) 109**] 1.6 and intact thoracic ascending aorta.
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the mitral postion, stable , functioning well and no pathological leaks identified with a mean transmitra gradient of 5mm of Hg.
Blood cultures from [**Hospital1 18**] never positive, but culture from [**7-26**] at OSH positive for Group B strep sensitive to penicillin and vanc (pt pcn allergic).
Endocarditis: Vegetations and perforation of mitral valve with 3+ mitral regurgitation; largest vegetation 1.5cm on anterior leaflet.
CT of head and chest done, negative for evidence of septic emboli.
Do not favor giving beta blocker in current setting, but will continue to monitor heart rate closely.
