There was some discordant staging information with a PET scan and CT scan suggesting disease confined to the esophagus.
An EUS suggested transmural involvement.

A final overhead image performed at the end of the procedure demonstrates a small amount of contrast in the distal esophagus, and contrast seen in distal bowel.
POD#3 Iv lopressor started and titrated for HR and BP control- previously on toprol XL and norvasc PTA.
POD#7 gastrograffin and barium swallow done -neg for anastomtic leak and showed thru passage of barium.
POD#10 Her J-tube became clogged and had to be miled at the area of the suture.
