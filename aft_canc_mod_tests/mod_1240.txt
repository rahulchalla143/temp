Her abdominal pain was sharp and did not radiate.
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 4527**] for concern of cholangitis and started on Amp, Levo and Flagyl with blood cultures drawn prior to antibiotics initiation.
Heart rate 101.
Blood pressure 105/56.
Respiratory rate 18.
Sating 100% on room air.
Pertinent physical examination findings included icteric sclera.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count was 40.8 consistent with her history of CLL, hematocrit 30.4, platelets 152, INR 2.3, PTT 30.1, potassium 3.7, bicarb 24, creatinine 1.7, total bilirubin 9.8, direct bilirubin 8.2, alkaline phosphatase 309, ALT 170, AST 117.
Her urinalysis was positive with protein greater then 300, 50 to 100 white blood cells, 5 to 10 red blood cells.
Her blood cultures from the outside hospital grew out Ampicillin resistant Klebsiella in two out of four bottles.
Chest x-ray was negative.
CT abdomen revealed intrahepatic biliary dilatation with a question mass in the pancrease.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography laboratory where multiple stones were found in the common bile duct consistent with choledocholithiasis.
The patient's obstruction was removed and a stent was placed in the common bile duct to facilitate drainage.
The patient was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit for one day due to a drop in her hematocrit down to 22 status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
No acute source of bleeding was found and the patient was transfused 2 units of blood and her hematocrit responded appropriately and was stable throughout her hospitalization.
A HIT antibody was sent out and was pending at the time of discharge to be followed up.
This was thought to also possibly be related to the patient's history of CLL as her white count remained in the 20 to 30,000 range despite appropriate antibiotic treatment.
The patient's antibiotic regimen was tailored to the Klebsiella that grew out of her blood and was tapered down to Levaquin alone, which was to be continued for a ten day course after discharge.
The patient's abdominal pain resolved and her bilirubin trended down to close to normal at the time of discharge.
During the patient's endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography she was noted to have esophageal candidiasis.
The patient was arranged to be followed up with her primary care physician on [**2102-5-1**] at which time an INR could be rechecked as the patient is on multiple new medications that could increase her INR.
The patient was able to transfer with her husband's assistance.
Levaquin 250 mg po q day times seven days to complete a ten day course after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
The patient had a brief run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and will therefore receive beta blockade for two weeks postoperatively.
