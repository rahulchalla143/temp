Her BP at that time was 190's/100's.
To [**Hospital **] Hospital where CXR showed mass.
Head CT was performed which showed mult lesions including cerebellar lesion with edema as well as basilar tip aneurysm.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: No axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy is seen.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: There is a subcentimeter hypoattenuating lesion in the left lobe of the liver, which most likely represents a cyst but malignancy cannot be excluded, and MRI would be recommended if further evaluation is indicated.
Liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, and left kidney are within normal limits.
Metastatic lesions, however, cannot be excluded; an ultrasound opr MRI may be helpful for clarification if indicated.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
This most likely represents a cyst; however, if clinically indicated, an MRI for further assessment would be helpful.
Ultrasounds or MRI would be recommended if further assessment is indicated.
MRI +/-gado plus mra Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 57 year old woman with large cystic lesions on head CT, large lung tumor recent hx of root canal.
R/O abcess vs metatsis; Also has basilar tip aneurysm Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained without and with intravenous gadolinium administration.
Correlation is made to a CT examination dated [**2118-3-15**].
Large signal flow void involving the basilar tip which should be further evaluated on the MRA exam of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] to follow.
As suspected on the CT examination, there is a large aneurysm involving the basilar tip, which measures 1.1 x 1 cm.
The study overall is insensitive to detect tiny aneurysms less than 3 mm in diameter.
she was initially evaluated by her primary care doctor, her chest radiograph showed left upper lung mass which is promt to do a head CT. Head CT revealed rigth frontal, right parietal and left cerebellar mass further evaluation with MRI confirmed the lesions and she admitted to Neurosurgery service.
Patient has been afebrile [**Hospital 67169**] hospital stay, vital signs has been stable.
