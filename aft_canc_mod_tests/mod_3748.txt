[**2139-10-6**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: 1.
For more sensitive evaluation for metastasic disease and infarction direct comparison with prior MR, repeat MRI may be performed as clinically indicated.
[**2139-10-6**] CT chest/abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Correlation with prior imaging is recommended.
Correlation with prior bone scan or other imaging recommended.
Otherwise, CXR revealed mass and left sided effusion, but no other acute changes.
Exam is w/o evidence of COPD flare and CXR does not reveal evidence of PNA.
CT chest ruled out PE.
# Metabolic acidosis - nongap at time of presentation to OSH ED; pt did have diarrhea with later positive C diff.
Her C diff was treated with PO flagyl and vanco.
