Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 144 with left bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray showed possible interstitial edema, persistent right basilar opacity which could represent pleural thickening or effusion, possible infection process in the right lung.
Repeat chest x-ray showed possible pneumonia in the lower lobes with a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe concerning for tuberculosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Infectious disease - As noted above, repeat chest x-ray showed cavitary lesions in the left apex.
All of the patient's blood cultures and sputum and urine cultures were.
She was Clostridium difficile negative and RPR negative.
The patient remained throughout the rest of the hospital day #2, throughout hospital course and isolation in negative pressure room with respiratory precautions.
In the Medicine Intensive Care Unit she was followed by repeated arterial blood gases.
She was kept on oxygen approximately .5 to 1 liter to keep saturations between 90 and 95%.
On hospital day #7 her thoracentesis was performed on a new left effusion with no complications, showed white blood cells of 50,l red blood cells 2,500, differential of 16 neutrophils, 33 lymphocytes, and 4 monocytes with 3 eosinophils.
Protein was 1.7, glucose 157, LDH 73, PH 7.8.
On hospital day #12 thoracentesis was performed on her right pleural effusion, red blood cells 50, red blood cells of 3,200, protein 1.2, glucose 92, LDH 106, PH 7.26, gram stain negative.
Cultures were at this time still pending and both pleural effusions were negative for malignant cells.
Troponin peak was noted to be 14.6, CK MB ranged between 12 and 3.
CKs ranged between 124 and 129.
Echocardiogram on hospital day #4 showed right atrium markedly dilated, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, severe global ventricular hypokinesis, severely depressed left ventricular systolic function and pulmonary hypertension.
On hospital day #2 the patient underwent repeat echocardiogram which again showed left atrium moderately dilated, right atrium markedly dilated with left ventricular wall thickness normal.
The patient was subsequently evaluated for infective endocarditis by blood cultures times three and computerized tomography scan of the head looking for signs of emboli.
Computerized tomography scan of the head results are subsequently pending at the time of this dictation.
Digoxin level at discharge was 0.6.
INR peaked at 7.7.
Hematocrit was stable at 29.9 to 34 until hospital day #15 when hematocrit was found to be 27.5 secondary to occult gastrointestinal bleed.
Follow up hematocrit was 32.2.
Hematocrit remained stable for the rest of the hospital course.
Renal - Baseline creatinine is 1 to 1.4.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Initial dehydration was treated with intravenous fluids.
Free calcium was noted to be 1.4, free calcium on discharge was noted to be 1.9.
Other laboratory studies were as follows, B12 7.9, folate 7.5, PTH 15, 25 hydroxy vitamin D, less than 7.
Head computerized tomography scan on hospital day #20 was performed, results are pending at the time of this dictation.
Colonoscopy was performed on hospital day #20 which showed diverticulosis and two polyps in the right colon that were subsequently removed and biopsied.
Liver function tests were followed q. two weeks secondary to antituberculosis medications.
Liver function tests after tuberculosis medications were started were within normal limits.
ALT was 22, ALT 23, LDH 342, alkaline phosphatase 158, bilirubin 0.5.
Endomysal antibody was 3, this was within normal limits.
Endocrine - Free cortisol was noted to be 22.
X-ray of the pelvis showed no fractures.
with following INR daily, until therapeutic dose is set.
The patient will also require liver function tests checked q. two weeks.
Pulmonary tuberculosis, reactivated 2.
