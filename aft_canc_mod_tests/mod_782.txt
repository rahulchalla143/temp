Cytology Sputum (expectorated) [**2149-9-3**]: POSITIVE, CONSISTENT WITH SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA.
CT Abd/Pelvis CT Angiogram [**2149-9-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head w/ & w/out contrast [**2149-9-5**]: IMPRESSION:  Mild brain atrophy and old lacunar infarct in the right thalamus, unchanged.
No contrast CT evidence of metastatic disease to the brain.
CXR [**2149-9-7**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-6**], there is little overall change.
Cardiac size remains within overall normal limits.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, IDDM, and recently identified emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, & LLL lung mass, who presents with respiratory distress and hypoglycemia.
The pulmonary team was consulted and request a CT to further evaluate his pulmonary disease.
The CT demonstrated paracentral and centrilobular emphysema in the upper lobes with extensive ground glass opacities and peripheral interstitial lung abnormalities in the right lung and the left lower lobe.
The etiology of his interstitial lung disease was unknown and he was scheduled to receive a bronchoscopy for further evaluation, but this was cancelled after the patient continued to trigger for hypoxic episodes with O2 sats to the high 60's-low 70's on 3L's.
# Right popliteal artery thrombosis: On [**9-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 19122**] had an episode of [**10-25**] sudden onset right calf pain following a physical exam earlier in the day that was positive for dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
As a result of the arterial thrombosis, his CK levels became elevated (4000's) and his Cr began to rise.
After <24 hours in the MICU for nursing needs, Palliative care was consulted and both the patient and his wife requested that he be allowed to return home on hospice.
As a result, his blood sugars ranged from 150-300's, but he had no further episodes of hypoglycemia or extreme hyperglycemia.
# Pulmonary Nodule: The patient was found to have a 4 cm pulmonary nodule in his LLL on CT at an OSH.
A repeat CT was performed at the [**Hospital1 18**] per Pulmonology work-up and confirmed this 4 cm mass in the left lower lobe.
An expectorated sputum culture was also sent that was positive for squamous cell carcinoma on [**9-4**].
The patient and his family was told of the diagnosis on [**9-5**], but given his other medical concerns, specifically his arterial thrombosis of the right leg, there was no further work-up of the cancer as an inpatient.
He denies chest pain and had MI work up at OSH, and recent TTE showed EF 55%.
Oxygen saturation 95% on 3L.
Pulmonologists were consulted to assess your respiratory distress and requested a CT scan of your chest.
The CT of the scan also revealed a mass in the left lobe of the lung concerning for malignancy.
A sputum culture obtained during this admission, confirmed a diagnosis of squamous cell cancer of the lung.
