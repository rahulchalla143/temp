She was found on echo to have aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, but preserved left ventricular function.
Catheterization showed severe aortic stenosis, mild aortic mitral regurgitation and a 60% lesion of the proximal left anterior descending artery.

A bedside exam was suggestive of aspiration with this liquids thus a pureed diet with nectar thick liquids was started.
A video swallow was performed which showed aspiration during and after swallowing of nectar thickened liquids.
Thyroid studies were obtained which showed mild hypothyroidism and her beta blockade was advanced.
A renal ultrasound was performed which showed a small right renal cyst and redemonstration of large heterogeneous left renal mass, likely representing a renal cell carcinoma.
Her creatinine promptly improved.
On [**2101-11-30**], a left thoracentesis was performed for a left pleural effusion draining 600cc of serous fluid.
Her lasix was restarted on [**11-30**] and on [**12-1**] her creatinine was again noted to be elevated to 2.3.
