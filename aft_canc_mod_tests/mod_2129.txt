Of note, in his prior admission, an EGD was performed that showed gastritis.
In the ED initial vitals were HR 120, RR: 40, SBP in 140s, O2 sats: 95% on RA.
Noted to have a wbc of 12.2.
CT Torso was done that showed a stable pleural effusion that was not drained.
Concern for PE, but patient not a canidate for CTA because of creatinine of 1.5, V/Q wouldn't work due to malignancy.
RR rate fluctates between 20 and 30 that responded to morphine and ativan.
breathing at a RR in the 20s with BP [**12/2117**] of and HR in the low 100s.
Drank [**MD Number(4) 42608**] with good effect.
Past Medical History: [**7-/2159**]: Diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer by CT guided biopsy [**2159-9-20**]: PET scan with low-attenuation lesion in the left lobe of the thyroid gland measuring 25 x 7 mm in addition to markedly FDG avid left upper lobe mass consistent with known cancer and FDG avid prominent bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy suspicious for metastatic disease, but no pathologically enlarged infraclavicular lymph nodes.
[**2160-7-24**]: CT demonstrated left upper lobe mass minimally increased in size from [**3-/2160**] with a sub 5 mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule with additional stable bilateral nodules, new left-sided pleural effusion.
Pathology revealed 4R lymph nodes with no malignancy but frozen sections showed metastatic large cell carcinoma and 4L lymph nodes that showed metastatic large cell carcinoma.
A level 7 lymph node showed metastatic large cell carcinoma and a parietal pleural biopsy also showed metastatic large cell carcinoma involving the pleura.

Questionable focus of enhancement within the right posterolateral aspect of the cervical spinal cord at the level of C1/C2 measuring 3.3 mm seen on the coronal images (series 1000, image 76).
MRI of the cervical spine might be helpful to further assess.
Extensive osseous metastatic lesions in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine as well as in the iliac bones and sacrum.
Extension into the neural foramina is difficult to assess, given the limitations of the study due to motion.

# Nausea/vomiting RUQ Pain:  Patient had a significant workup in prior admissions with EGD showing gastritis and a RUQ ultrasound was negative.
CT abdomen also negative for acute process.
An MRI head showed metastatic disease of his large cell lung cancer, and this was thought to be the etiology of his nausea and vomiting.
His neuro exam was monitored daily for any new neurologic deficits- there were no changes in his exam, see above.
# Dyspnea: Initially patient's RR was in the 40s, with oxygen saturations in the high 90s.
Patient never had low saturations and was placed on nasal cannula at 3 liters/min of oxygen mainly for comfort.
He was monitored overnight in the intensive care unit and his respiratory rate decreased to the teens and 20s.
# Renal insufficiency:  creatinine remained stable and at his baseline of 1.3-1.5 throughout his hospital course.
Amlodipine, HCTZ, and imdur managed BP well.

You had an MRI of your head that showed your lung cancer had likely spread to your brain, and this was likely causing the nausea and vomiting.
