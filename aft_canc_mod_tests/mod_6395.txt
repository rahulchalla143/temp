Admission Date:  [**2200-2-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-2-19**]   Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Drug Allergy Information on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: consulted for SDH found on head CT   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 85 male sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ER with mental status changes from the nursing home.
He had a head CT which revealed a SDH and small SAH.
Sensation: Intact to light touch bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: CT head [**2200-2-17**]: FINDINGS: The study is compared with the initial NECT of [**2-14**] and the interval unenhanced and enhanced MR examinations of [**2200-2-15**].
Moreover, the findings on both this exam and the recent enhanced MR study raise the serious possibility of at least partial invasion of the immediately subjacent superior sagittal sinus, without definite thrombosis, and possible venous obstruction-related edema in local white matter.
MRI Brain [**2200-2-15**]: FINDINGS: The study is significantly limited due to patient motion artifacts.
There is enhancement noted in the area of known hemorrhage in the left parieto- occipital region, compared to the pre-contrast sequences done on the prior study.
However, the etiology of enhancement is not clear as there is significant amount of hemorrhage in this location, as seen on the prior CT and MR studies.
Repeat evaluation, after resolution of the hemorrhage can be considered, to evaluate for any underlying vascular or space-occupying lesion.
Close followup with CT scan can also be considered as clinically indicated.
He was admitted with a presumed SDH on the CT scan.
However, the patient had an MRI which revealed a mass resembling a meningioma.
He was evaluated by PT and a speech/swallowing therapist.
