Infection thought to be less likely given negative BAL.
CTA negative for PE.
CT head for somnolence negative.
A bronchoscopy was performed which revealed GNRs in the sputum.
He was kept on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and was switched to Meropenem when BAL cultures showed Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to this antibiotic.
On [**3-8**], a trach was placed at the bedside without difficulty.
He was able to tolerate breathing without ventilatory support for 1.5 hours by [**2162-3-14**], but otherwise was on pressure support, with a PSV of 12 and PEEP of 5.
[**Date Range 3242**] was consulted and recommended that we check CT sinus, CT chest, and start empiric antibiotic treatment with vanc/cefepime/voriconazole.
The results of the CT sinus and CT chest were consistent with marked interval worsening of right lower lobe pneumonia.. Culture data from BAL was consistent with meropenem-sensitive klebsiella pneumonia.
C. difficile toxin was negative x 2, and vancomycin was stopped on [**2162-3-12**], with no further fevers.
CTA negative for PE.
