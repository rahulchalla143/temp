Course at [**Hospital6 1708**] was notable for intermittent intubation, bronchoscopy that demonstrated left main stem proximal abnormality, and a right main stem involved with metastatic disease including the bronchus intermedius.
He was sent to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further evaluation and was admitted directly to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Renal cell carcinoma; diagnosed in [**2130**], now metastatic.
c.  A computed tomography of the abdomen an pelvis showed no mass at that time.
A computed tomography of the chest showed a loculated right pleural effusion with a subcarinal mediastinal mass as well as a right lower lobe lesion and focal lobar lesion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 96.8, his heart rate was 101, his blood pressure was 123/39, his respiratory rate was 33, and his oxygen saturation was 95% on 100% nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination the pupils were equally round and reactive to light.
Cardiovascular examination with a irregular and irregular rate with a 2/6 systolic murmur that starts at the apex.
Abdominal examination revealed a scaphoid abdomen, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube intact without erythema, nontender.
Difficult examination due to upright position.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Notable for a white blood cell count of 12.5 and a hematocrit of 38.6.
Platelets were 95.
Arterial blood gas was 7.35/65/62/37.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 89 with flat T waves in lead III.
A chest x-ray showed multiple pulmonary nodules in the left and right lung with a right lower lobe/right middle lobe opacity.
The patient had been discharged from the [**Hospital6 4193**] after a bronchoscopy showed no further options for intervention from their standpoint.
The bronchoscopy showed multiple tracheal lesions including a carinal lesion with partial obstruction of the left main and almost 95% obstruction of the right main.
At the time of discharge, his oxygen saturation was stable on 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
QUESTION OF A RIGHT LOWER LOBE INFILTRATE ISSUES:  The patient had a right lower lobe infiltrate seen on chest x-ray on admission.
His albumin was low, and he also had an elevated spot urine protein to creatine ratio.
An ultrasound of the right upper extremity was negative for deep venous thrombosis.
A swallowing study was repeated here.
A video swallow study showed aspiration with thin liquids and nectar consistency despite swallowing maneuvers.
It is planned that when his strength improves that a swallowing study could be repeated at a later time.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Out of bed to chair with assistance; oxygen saturation stable on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula; short of breath at rest; tachypneic; using accessory muscles with respiration; hemodynamically stable otherwise.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Please note that all by mouth medications are to be given through the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
Albumin nebulizers 1 nebulizer inhaled q.3h.
(times 5 days, to complete a 10-day course).
(times 5 days, to complete a 10-day course).
