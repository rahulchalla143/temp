Post procedure the patient's hematocrit dropped to 23 and then to 18 on the morning of admission to [**Hospital1 69**].
CT scan at that time revealed free intraperitoneal blood in both pericolic gutters.
Vital signs were all within normal limits.
PERTINENT LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 21.1, hematocrit 31.8, platelets 117, sodium 145, potassium 3.6, chloride 107, bicarb 25, BUN 18, creatinine 1.0, glucose 109, PT 13, INR 1.1, PTT 25.3.
ALT 61, AST 79, alkaline phosphatase 100, total bilirubin 3.2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient was alert and in no acute distress.
Heart rate 75.
Blood pressure 158/82.
Respiratory rate 15.
Sating 96% on room air.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
On hospital day number two [**2154-11-23**] the patient's hematocrit remained stable at 33, total bilirubin was 2.3.
Repeat CT on that day revealed large amounts of intraabdominal free fluid and a subcapsular liver hematoma.
On hospital day number three [**2154-11-24**] the patient's hematocrit remained stable at 30.6 and was transferred to the floor.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable at 31.9 and belly examination was benign.
Subsequent chest x-ray revealed proper placement of the line.
In addition on hospital day number four [**2154-11-25**] the patient received a CT of the chest to examine possibilities of metastatic pulmonary disease, which revealed no evidence of pulmonary metastases, but extensive respiratory motion as well as a basilar atelectatic change, small pleural effusions, limited the assessment for a very small lesions.
Also of note there was increased number of lymph nodes in the mediastinum and in particular lymph node on the left upper paratracheal lesion just below the left lobe of the thyroid gland, which was slightly enlarged by CT criteria.
Belly examination continued to be unremarkable.
Of note, the patient's total bilirubin increased from 2.5 on [**2154-11-25**] to 4.4 on [**2154-11-26**], but began to trend down on hospital day six [**2154-11-27**] down to 3.7.
