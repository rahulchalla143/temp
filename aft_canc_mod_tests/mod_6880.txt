Chest x-ray [**2151-3-9**]: The NG tube tip is in stomach.
There is interval decrease in the degree of pulmonary edema otherwise no significant change since the prior study is demonstrated.
The left upper lobe lesion demonstrated on CT torso from [**2151-3-6**] is seen but the CT technique characterized better dimensions of the mass.
MRI BRAIN [**2151-3-10**] IMPRESSION: Numerous lesions in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, the largest with central cystic-appearing necrosis and many, hemorrhagic with blood products of varying ages, consistent with extensive metastatic disease.

Her blood sugars remained difficult to control in the setting of steroids.
Her lantus was eventually increased to 50mg PO qam and may need to be uptitrated further.
Her lantus and sliding scale regimens will likely need to be titrated further.
CK peaked at 7800 and trended downward; she likely did not have rhabdomyolysis.
# Elevated lipase / acute pancreatitis at presentation: Lipase >800 with CT showing some mesenteric stranding consistent with pancreatitis at presentation.
However, possibly related to spinal mets although none were noted on CT abdomen/pelvis.
