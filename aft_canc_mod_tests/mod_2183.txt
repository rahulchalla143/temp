LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11.6, hematocrit 22.8, platelets 344.
Patient's baseline hematocrit is 35.
Chemistries:  Sodium 130, potassium 4.1, chloride 89, bicarb 30, BUN 80, creatinine 2.4, glucose 126.
Calcium 8.1, magnesium 2, phosphorus 6.1.
CK 20, troponin 1.1.
PT 13.2, PTT 29, INR of 1.2.
CHEST X-RAY:  Evidence of congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis, cardiomegaly.
Patient underwent upper endoscopy on [**1-20**].
As noted above, the patient's chest x-ray disclosed the presence of bilateral pleural effusions.
Cytology cultures and Gram stain were negative.
During his hospitalization, the patient's chest tubes have continued to drain significant amounts of pleural fluid.
BAL culture disclosed presence of gram-negative rods.
GI:  As noted above, the patient underwent upper endoscopy on [**1-20**].
Blood was noted in his stomach.
Biopsies were done and pathology disclosed no evidence of neoplasm.
The patient has required a total of 13 units of packed red blood cell transfusions to maintain his hematocrit greater than 30 during his hospital stay.
Echocardiogram was consistent with a restrictive cardiomyopathy with a normal ejection fraction.
A repeat echocardiogram was done to rule out pericardial effusion causing tamponade as an etiology of the patient's hypotensive.
Due to concern for adrenal insufficiency, random cortisol levels were checked and the patient's cortisol level was found to be 15.
[**Country 7018**] red staining of the patient's kidney biopsy from [**2142**] was negative for amyloidosis.
Patient's BUN and creatinine continued to rise.
A renal ultrasound did not disclose evidence of hydronephrosis.
Heme:  As noted above, the patient has required a total of 13 units of packed red blood cells during his hospital stay for a maintenance of a hematocrit greater than 30.
The patient meets three minor criteria for multiple myeloma, namely bone marrow biopsy with 10% plasma cells, positive UPEP, and IgM less than 50.
It is believed that the patient's gastric biopsy is consistent with a light-chain gastropathy, presumably from the multiple myeloma.
During his hospital stay, multiple blood, fungal, sputum, and urine cultures have been sent to the laboratory for workup of a source of the patient's sepsis.
