She was transfused a total of 4U prbcs for a goal of >28 and her hct has since remained.
Although poorly prepped, colonoscopy was normal and her EGD showed atrophic gastritis in the antrum.
H. Pylori studies were sent and should be followed up as an outpatient.
She will need a repeat colonoscopy in 6 months which can be set up by her PCP.
This will need further evaluation as well for octreotide scan.
#) CAD: No signs of ischemia on EKG but paced rhythm.
Her ACEI was held on admission in the setting of her GI bleed and was restarted as her blood pressure tolerated.
ACEI and Lasix can be added back as blood pressure and fluid status tolerates.
On HD 6, she was transferred to the surgical service for planned surgical intervention of her known mesenteric mass; she was afebrile, hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 34, ambulating with a walker, tolerating Ensure supplementation, and had moderate right upper quadrant pain controlled with Vicodin.
On HD 7 and 8, she underwent an Octreotide scan, which demonstrated no abnormal focus of tracer uptake to indicate somatostatin receptor avid tumor.
On HD 10 she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, small bowel resection, and cholecystectomy; intra-operatively she was found to have large bulky disease, consistent with carcinoid with nodules which had a tremendous sclerotic reaction which basically enveloped substantial portions of the small intestine, she had no complications.
Post-operatively she was NPO with intravenous hydration, Morphine PCA, nasogastric tube, foley catheter, and was continued on telemetry monitoring while receiving intravenous beta-blockade.
