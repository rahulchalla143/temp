She says her symptoms started 2 weeks ago, even before her breast surgery, which was on [**2200-6-4**].
In the ED, initial VS were: T 98.0 BP 103/73 HR 112 RR 16 Sat 97%/RA.
Bedside ultrasound showed significant bilateral pleural effusion without pericardial effusion.
She was guaiac negative, but head CT showed an abnormality for which the differential included subarachnoid hemorrhage, so heparin was not started.
On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], vital signs were 97.5 120 24 128/75 100%/2L.
Hypoechoic solid, irreg., spiculated 2.5x2.1x2.4cm.

# [**6-13**] CT head: Abnormal gyriform hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe of uncertain etiology in the setting of prior intravenous contrast administration, but the differential diagnosis includes abnormal enhancement associated with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, possibly with a parenchymal mass or edema; although unlikely, it is not possible to exclude hemorrhage.
Recommend an MRI for further evaluation.
# [**6-14**] Echo: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left frontal enhancement and left mastoid opacification appear unchanged.
# [**6-16**] CXR IMPRESSION:  Moderate left and trace right pleural effusion with likely mild pulmonary edema.
Two heterogeneous complex collections, which appear to communicate, are identified in the anterior left axilla.
A contrast CT may be useful to evaluate for continued bleeding, if clinically warranted, but venous bleeding can be difficult to assess.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was guaiac negative, but head CT showed an abnormality for which the differential included subarachnoid hemorrhage, so initiation of heparin was deferred and pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Neurology was consulted and an LP was performed, which was unrevealing for any infectious etiologies.
She had a TTE which was negative for any evidence of right heart strain.
# systolic CHF: Because of new pleural effusions noted on chest CT, TTE was performed which showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with EF of 25% along with small pericardial effusion (no tamponade), which was new from prior echo at start of chemo therapy.
Pt had a therapeutic/diagnosis paracentesis performed, which was transudative in nature.
Her pleural fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Her factor X level was checked given that patient was on Lovenox and there was concern that if she was supratherapeutic, it may be contributing to bleeding within her recent surgical site.
# Brain MRI c/w infarcts: Because of abnormal head CT obtained in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MRI was obtained which showed several enhancing lesions consistent with subacute infarcts.
She had a TTE with negative bubble study.
She was continued on her pravastatin and aspirin and will need a repeat MRI as an outpatient in [**1-6**] months.
Her blood sugar was controlled with insulin 75/25 as well as sliding scale insulin.
# Pt will need a repeat outpt brain MRI in [**1-6**] months.
