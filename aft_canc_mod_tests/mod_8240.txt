[**2128-8-3**] PCXR:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-20**], there are lower lung volumes with continued evidence of chronic pulmonary disease and atelectasis at the base on the left.
Dilatation of gas-filled loops of large and small bowel are consistent with the clinical diagnosis of adynamic ileus.
[**2128-8-6**] PCXR:  FINDINGS: Since chest radiograph from [**2128-8-3**], there are no significant relevant interval changes.
Right frontal chronic subdural collection likely representing hygroma, unchanged since most recent study on [**2127-12-29**].
[**2128-8-7**]  CT of Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis  IMPRESSION: 1.
Bilateral opacities at the lung bases, left greater than right, which could represent infectious process such as aspiration pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: General Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment.
On exam patient was AO x 0, not following commands, tremulous, and delirious.
CV was RRR with nl S1 and S2, lungs were CTA but patient was exhibiting tachypnea and 02 sats were in low 90s.
Patient was transferred to ICU for further evaluation and monitoring, CT of Head, Chest, Abd, and Pelvis were ordered which were largely unremarkable for acute process, and blood cultures and urine cultures were sent which did not show any growth.
Head CT did not reveal any acute abnormalities.
CV: The patient's blood pressure and rate were controlled with diltiazam and lopressor.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint until POD 7 when patient began to deteriorate due to suspected DTs and respiratory rate greatly increased and O2sats were in low 90s and required oxygen via nasal canula.
Vital signs were routinely monitored.
Foley catheter was required during ICU stay on POD 7 and 8 for urine output monitoring and was discontinued on POD 9 while on floor and voided without issue.
NGT put out several liters of fluid over the subsequent 2 days and electrolytes were routinely monitored and repleted.
NGT was removed on POD 7 without further abdominal pain or distension.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
RPR and urine cultures were negative.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
