His thoracotomy wound developed erythema and blistering and he had an incision & drainage of [**2142-3-21**] (fluid culture returned without growth).
Ultimately, his sputum was showed enterobacter; the patient was started on meropenem.
A CT chest with contrast performed (& read) at OSH demonstrated a 7 x 3.4 x 1.7 cm loculated pleural fluid collection at the lateral posterior aspect of the L lung base.
Serial chest x-rays during his admission at [**Hospital3 **] demonstrated development of a a R lower lobe PNA.
A tagged WBC scan was performed on [**4-30**] in an attempt to identify an infectious source.
The scan demonstrated increased update in the L chest adjacent to the aortic arch which was suspicious for a periarotic infection.
According to notes, he has been afebrile for several days but developed WBC 12.3 with 13% bands [**Last Name (un) **].
As such, the patient is being transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
CT C-A-P unremarkable.

His most recent CT scan shows evidence of bronchiectasis.
# Leukocytosis: The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for leukocytosis 12.3 with 13% bandemia.
There was some concern for a L-sided loculated effusion on OSH CT scan, but on review of these scans (compared to prior) these changes appear to be chronic.
Given the patient's ongoing diarrhea which has been unremitting since his initially hospitalizaton for cardiac surgery as well as his exposure to multiple antibiotics, it was felt that a C. Diff PCR should be sent.
This patient's care was discussed with his CT surgery & ID team.
# Hypernatremia: Admission sodium 146.
Sodium corrected to 142.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:  # Hypertension: Pt's BP on presentation was in the low 100s.
As such his metoprolol, hydralazine and isosorbide were held during hospitalization.
# Anemia: Hematocrit stable 34-38.
