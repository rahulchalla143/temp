Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-7-17**], no change.
His admission ECG was unchanged from prior.
Cardiac enzymes were elevated, though trending down.
He received ACLS treatment, including sodium bicarbonate, and regained normal rhythm and a blood pressure (estimated resuscitation time <5minutes, pulseless time <20 seconds).
