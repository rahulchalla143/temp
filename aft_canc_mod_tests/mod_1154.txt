Pt sent for CTA chest today: neg for PE, showed reaccumulation of large bilateral pleural effusions.
Pain [**9-11**] with [**Month/Year (2) **].
Biopsies were performed and pathology demonstrated adenocarcinoma, mucin-producing with few signet ring cells, moderately differentiated.
He underwent PET/CT scan [**2113-12-31**], which showed FDG uptake in the GE junction but no evidence of regional or distant metastases.
His last radiation treatment was on [**2114-3-1**], total dose 5040 cGy.
He underwent [**Month/Day/Year 12351**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy [**2114-4-25**] which demonstrated residual disease, including a positive proximal margin.
Surveillance endoscopy demonstrated friable and nodular distal esophagus and biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma.

However, the presence of tachycardia and relatively small chamber sizes along with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function is suggestive of poor diastolic filling.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-7-9**] and [**2115-7-8**], the findings are similar.
CT Chest [**2115-7-18**]: Moderate layering nonhemorrhagic left pleural effusion is larger  today than on [**7-11**].
The superior vena cava above the pericardial reflection is larger than the intrapericardial segment, and the right atrium and ventricle are both smaller today than on [**7-11**], warranting evaluation for possible early cardiac tamponade.

CTA showing reaccumulation of large bilateral pleural effusions.
Active diagnoses: #Bilateral pleural effusions, R-sided empyema: CT on admission showed large bilateral pleural effusions, with the right one being loculated, which had reaccumulated from prior drainage 6/[**2114**].
Pt had R pigtail placed [**2115-7-5**] by IP with pleural [**Month/Day/Year **] exudative, cytology neg, culture with rare growth of lactobacillus and STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS.
Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension (SBP to 80s) and tachycardia [**2115-7-5**].
Bl cultures from [**2115-7-6**] negative x2.
A repeat gram stain of the right pleural [**Month/Day/Year **] was sent, which showed polymicrobial results.
This repeat pleural [**Month/Day/Year **] culture from R on [**2115-7-6**] with moderate growth of lactobacillus and STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS.
Given the concern for an esophageal-pleural fistula, a CT thorax with PO contrast was done on [**7-7**] which was inconclusive, so an esophagram was performed on [**7-9**] that did not show evidence of esopahgeal leak.
R sided effusion/empyema concerning for abscess or necrotizing pneumonia per CT chest [**2115-7-11**].
Pt had CT chest to evaluate if repeat pigtail needed to be placed.
IP reported no need for placing another chest tube on the R. They want to follow-up with repeat chest CT and then appt in clinic to evaluate if reaccumulation occurs to require a chest tube.
Again, thoracic surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding possibility of intervention based on CT chest [**7-17**].
Cardiology recommended following the effusion with a repeat echo in 2 weeks (~[**2115-7-23**]).
Pt found to have slight increase in pericardial effusion on chest CT [**7-17**], so TTE completed [**7-18**].
HR in 100-110s mostly with occasional elevation to 120s.
Pt had duplex U/S on [**7-14**] which was neg for DVT.
L arm edema worsened, so pt had repeat duplex U/S on [**7-18**].
Chronic diagnoses: # Recurrent esophageal adenocarcinoma: s/p C5D1 [**2115-5-30**], cycle 6 held [**7-4**].
# GERD: continued home PPI  Transitional issues: # Pt to f/u with ID in [**Hospital 4898**] clinic, IP with plan for repeat chest CT prior to appt, cards for pericardial effusion f/u # Pt will also f/u with OP oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] # Pt will require weekly lab draws: CBC with diff, Chem7, AST, ALT; please fax results to ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4591**].

Your pleural effusions were found to be increased on the CT scan of your chest.
A repeat CT scan on [**7-11**] showed that the infection in your lung had not gotten better.
