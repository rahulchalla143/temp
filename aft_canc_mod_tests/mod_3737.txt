CT T-spine at [**Location (un) **] ER revealed linear fracture of T9 body and underlying ankylosing spondylitis.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care and ortho eval.
Plan for T and C spine MRI, unable to tolerate MRI, got T spine but agitated so came back.
Intubated for repeat C spine, however, pt deemed too large for MRI and plan was changed to have MRI done at [**Hospital1 2025**] (open MRI).
Neuro assessement decreased mental status most likely confusion consistent with metabolic encephalopathy and recommended repeat CT head (negative for ICH), avoid narcotics, and CIWA scale.
-sensory: No deficits to light touch throughout.

Unclear if there is extension of the fracture line into the posterior elements- correlate with outside CT scan (not available to us at this time).
[**7-24**] T spine XR: A total of five views is compared with recent examination dated [**2133-7-13**].
Trauma: T9 fracture - s/p fusion.
C spine MRI inconclusive and should be maintained on the [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar for 6 months total.
Repeat T spine XR [**7-24**] with out change.
Also will need T spine films 2-3 weeks post discharge.
# Pneumonia: found to have a pneumonia on CXR and sputum cultures showed Klebsiella.
