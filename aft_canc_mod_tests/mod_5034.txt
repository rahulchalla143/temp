He was found to be hyperkalemic to 6.5 and had a Cr of 4.3 and was transferred to ER.

Calculated EF 78% with normal myocardial perfusion and wall size and motion.
Tumor Markers: CA19-9: 37, CEA 5.7, PSA 0.4   Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo m with etoh cirrhosis on regular paracentesis at baseline, presented to OSH with presumed worsened Cr (unknown baseline), hyperkalemia and worsening mental status.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for transplant evaluation and further work-up.
His pre-transplant evaluation included multiple infectious disease serologies, non-invasive cardiac imaging, MRI/MRA of the liver, serial paracenteses, colonoscopy and EGD, tumor markers, and dental evaluation.
On presentation his INR was 1.7, Alb was 2.6, total bili was 4.2 and ammonia level was 282.
He was very confused and had displayed prominent asterixis on exam c/w hepatic encephalopathy.
By discharge he was conversant with content appropriate to questioning, attentive to interview and exams, and following directions appropriately to check blood sugars and administer insulin injections.
During the evaluation for the trigger for the encephalopathy, a diagnostic paracentesis was performed on the second day of his [**Hospital1 18**] stay.
It revealed WBC 387 RBC 1400 polys 48%.
Serial diagnostic/therapeutic paracenteses were performed to follow clearance of the infection which was ultimately confirmed on [**6-28**].
# Bacteremia:  Blood cultures drawn on admission also grew viridans streptococci.
The patient had a TTE to evaluate for endocarditis which was negative.
Repeat blood cultures from hospital day 2 and 4 have resulted as negative.
Although the line was not thought to be the culprit source for the infection, the line was pulled when adequate access was obtained.
Cath tip culture was negative.
# Hyperkalemia:  Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] the patient had a K level of 5.2.
An ECG was obtained.
# Renal Failure: The patient has a history of hepatorenal syndrome and although his baseline creatinine was unknown prior to admission, his dropping UOP, euvolemic status, and pre-renal ARF were consistent with hepatorenal syndrome.
This diagnosis was further supported by low urinary protein/creatinine ratio, bland urine sediment, negative for hepatis serologies, negative cryoglobulin and no hydronephrosis by u/s.
His creatinine was at a maximum of 4.3 on admission and slowly trended down with continued treatment.
However, his creatinine showed some lability and concern persisted for the need for combined liver-kidney transplant.
The pre-transplant evaluation revealed no contra-indications to transplant, and the patient was placed on the transplant list.
For results of the pre-op evaluation, please see "Pertinent Results."
A glycosylated hemoglobin was normal at 6% and the hyperglycemia was managed with insulin.
His blood sugar control improved with a twice daily dosing regimen of NPH with a sliding scale for coverage.
He will continue to monitor his blood sugars and administer insulin at home with assistance of VNA and family members.
# Teeth: During the evaluation for the source of the bacteremia, a Panarex film was obtained and a dental consult was called.
One Touch Test     Strip Sig: as needed  Miscell.
Wake up: 1) Check blood sugar, 2) give insulin - 10 units of NPH and regular insulin according to both the sliding scale and measured blood glucose, 3) eat 30 minutes after insulin.
30 min before lunch: 1) check blood sugar, 2) give regular insulin according to sliding scale and blood glucose measurement, 3) eat 30 minutes after insulin.
30 minutes before dinner: 1) check blood sugar, 2) give regular insulin according to both the sliding scale and blood glucose measurement, 3) eat 30 minutes after insulin.
Bedtime: 1) check blood sugar, 2) give 8 units of NPH and regular insulin depending on sliding scale and blood glucose measurement.
