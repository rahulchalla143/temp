In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.4, HR 115, BP 117/95, RR 16.
EKG demonstrated electrical alternans and consequently a bedside ECHO was done which demonstrated large effusion with suggestion of tamponade.
All of the other review of systems were negative otherwise than noted in HPI.
Stage I (T1C, N0, M0) 1.5 cm, ER positive, infiltrating ductal carcinoma diagnosed in [**2100**].
Underwent lumpectomy, 5 cycles of adjuvant CMF and radiation.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2116-9-12**]: Difficult study due to patient frequent coughing.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**2116-9-12**]: 1.
Labs on admission (10/10/9): WBC-6.6 RBC-4.82 Hgb-15.0 Hct-44.7 MCV-93 MCH-31.2 MCHC-33.6 RDW-13.6 Plt Ct-259 Glucose-110* UreaN-22* Creat-0.9 Na-140 K-3.9 Cl-102 HCO3-29 AnGap-13 Lactate-1.9 .
Pertinent labs: HbA1c-5.8 CEA-1.4 CA27.29-25 proBNP-94 ALT-16 AST-24 AlkPhos-83 TotBili-0.3 LD(LDH)-127 .
Discharge labs (10/20/9): WBC-6.7 RBC-4.41 Hgb-13.1 Hct-40.8 MCV-93 MCH-29.7 MCHC-32.1 RDW-13.5 Plt Ct-432 Glucose-84 UreaN-17 Creat-0.9 Na-140 K-5.1 Cl-103 HCO3-29 AnGap-13 .
Pericardial fluid biopsy 10/10/9: Positive for malignant cells.
Resting hemodynamics revealed hemodynamic evidence of pericardial tamponade, with equalization of the end-diastolic pressure contours.
Pericardial pressure recordings demonstrated equalization of right atrial and pericardial pressures.
After removal of 500 mL of dark sanguinous fluid, pericardial  pressures decreased to < 5 mmHg, although right heart pressures remained elevated with PCWP of 18mmHg, RVEDP of 14mmHg, and RA pressure of 16mmHg, with a prominant 'Y' descent and square root sign, consistent with residual effusive-constrictive picture.
10/10/9 Echo: Post-cardiocentesis echocardiogram performed in the cath lab.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-9-12**] (post pericardiocentesis), no change.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2116-7-20**] the rate has increased.
Compared to previous tracing ST-T wave changes are new.
[**9-16**] Pleural fluid analysis: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**9-16**] CT torso: 1.
No pulmonary lesion, however evaluation limited by atelectasis.
Pathology - pleural biopsy & pericardium: I. Pleural biopsy: - Fragments of pleura and skeletal muscle.
10/15/9 CXR: FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position and analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of [**2116-9-16**].
On physical exam patient has distant heart sounds, increased JVP suggestive of tamponade.
Patient currently tachycardiac with stable blood pressure and no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
ECHO demonstrated large pericardial effusion with right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Pericardial effusion was sent to pathology - found to be a malignant effusion, with cells consistent with breast carcinoma.
Thoracentesis done in the CCU to drain the right pleural effusion ([**9-16**]), with cytology & laboratory studies sent.
Hematology/oncology was consulted, laboratory/imaging studies ordered for them, and outpatient follow-up was set-up.
CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
You will need to have the following tests done here in the next week: 1.Bone scan: please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9595**] to confirm date and time.
