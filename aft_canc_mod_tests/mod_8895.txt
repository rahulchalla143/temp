Extremely echogenic liver which seriously limits evaluation for focal abnormalities (or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation).
His Hct was stable and he was transferred to the floor at 29.
His hct was checked [**Hospital1 **] at first and then daily.
There was questionable mass on endoscopy whose pathology returned as normal gastric mucosa.
PPI was held given it is a  potential trigger to thrombocytopenia.
He had a repeat endscopy on [**2169-5-15**] which showed multiple erosions but no active bleeding with pending biopsy results at time of discharge.
Initially patient was transfused for platelet goal of 50.
He only needed a transfusion on [**2169-5-3**] for a nose bleed and guaiac positive stool.
Bone marroy biopsy was attempted [**2169-5-8**], but at that point platelets began to improve, so it was not reattempted.
since his Hct remained stable, a steroid trial was started on [**5-10**], 1mg per lb at dry weight.
Max WBC count 18.1.
UA negative and CXR negative.
Does have significant amount of ascites on exam however he is afebrile and without abdominal pain on exam which seems less consistent with SBP.
Your blood level remained stable after that.
