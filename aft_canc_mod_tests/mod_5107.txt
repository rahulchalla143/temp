LINE PLACEMENT	Study Date of [**2174-11-25**] 12:47 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-7**], there has been placement of a left IJ catheter that extends to the upper to mid portion of the SVC.
Within the left ventricle, a filling defect measuring up to 2.3 x 2.0 cm (4A:5) was not present on the CT of [**2174-5-16**].
Filling defect in the left ventricle, not present on the examination of [**2174-5-16**], incompletely evaluated and may represent clot.
Further evaluation with echo may be performed.
XR CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2174-11-28**] 2:19 PM INDINGS: Moderate left and small-to-moderate right pleural effusions are increased since the prior study.
LINE PLACEMENT	Study Date of [**2174-12-1**] 8:15 PM PIC line is curled in the left axilla.
Lung volumes are lower today than on [**11-28**] exaggerating size of mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and reflected in moderate-to-severe bibasilar atelectasis left greater than right.
PROSTATE U.S.	Study Date of [**2174-12-2**] 9:57 AM PROSTATE ULTRASOUND: Transrectal examination was performed.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2171-12-19**] the Q waves in the right precordial leads are new but may be related to altered lead placement.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2174-11-25**] at 3:55:25 PM Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-7-28**], apical LV dysfunction and LV thrombus are new.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2174-11-28**] at 12:21:23 PM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-11-25**], the current study has limited images.
A CT abdomen/pelvis showed possible prostatic abscess and this was later confirmed on prostatic ultrasound.
LV thrombus was confirmed on echocardiogram and cardiology were consulted recommending continued anticoagulation and repeat echo as an out-patient.
His blood pressure improved with dopamine and was successfully weaned off pressors in less than 24 hours while continuing IVF boluses as needed.
His HCT dropped slightly in the setting of intravenous rehydration, but he did not have hematochezia, melena or hematemesis.
CT-abdomen/pelvis [**11-25**] showed a new hypodensity on the right prostate gland concerning for abscess in addition to a filling defect in the LV in keeping with clot.
Cultures were all negative aside from a urine culture that grew Staph from [**2174-11-17**] and he was started empirically on vancomycin, pip/tazo and metronidazole on [**11-25**], and metronidazole was discontinued after C.difficile toxin returned negative on [**11-27**].
Follow-up urine cultures were negative and he was changed from vanc/pip/tazo to naficillin 2g q4 on [**11-29**] in addition to high-dose trim/sulfa to cover for prostate abscess.
A PICC line was successfully inserted on [**12-2**] (unable to pass axilla on left and difficult but successful insertion on right) to complete his Abx course on  Nafcillin IV to finish on  [**12-9**] and oral trim/sulfa to finish [**2175-1-23**].
He will be seen by ID on [**12-29**] and a prostate ultrasound will be repeated with an enema 1 hour prior.
#  DVT: Mr [**Known lastname 64819**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with a unilateral swollen left leg and a doppler U/S on [**11-24**] showed deep venous thrombosis extending from the left distal common femoral vein to the popliteal vein.
fXa level on [**12-5**] was  1.9 and dose was decreased to 80mg [**Hospital1 **].
#LV thrombus: CT Abdomen/pelvis on [**11-25**] was concerning for LV thrombus and an echocardiogram on [**11-25**] showed LVEF 45-50%, mild regional LV systolic dysfunction, focal apical LV akinesis with an intracavitary thrombus 1.8 x 1.8.
Cardiology were consulted and recommended continued anticoagulation with cardiology f/u and repeat ECHO as outpatient to determine duration of treatment.
Echo on [**11-28**] showed persistent LV thrombus.
On [**12-5**] fXa level was 1.9 and dose was decreased from 100mg [**Hospital1 **] to 80mg [**Hospital1 **].
He will be seen by cardiology on [**12-14**] with repeat echo in a few months.
CTA of Abdomen & Pelvis on [**11-8**] was notable for possible cecal AVM without acute active bleeding.
Subsequent colonoscopy on [**11-9**] revealed moderate diverticulosis and small clean-based shallow ulcer in the rectum without signs of active bleeding.
