He was brought to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital **] Hospital where a CT scan showed a right basal ganglia hemorrhage without mass effect.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  His blood pressure is 133/70, pulse is 72, respiratory rate 18.
His motor examination was normal bulk and tone, however, his tone was increased on the left upper extremity, no tremor on the right.
Sensation was decreased to light touch, pin prick, temperature, cold, vibration, and proprioception on the left.
Reflexes were [**2-23**] on the right and [**3-23**] on the left, however, both decreased at the plantars [**1-23**].
Grasp reflex was absent.
Laboratories at the outside hospital showed a white count of 24.2, hematocrit of 35.2, and glucose of 29.
His troponin was less than 0.2.
CT scan of the brain showed a 2.5 x 1.7 x 4 cuts intraparenchymal bleed involving the right thalamus, and capsule slightly increased in size compared to outside films with slight mass effect.
We admitted him to the Neuromedicine service in the Intensive Care Unit for close blood pressure monitoring with a goal of less than 160 and close neurologic examination with plans to repeat the CT scan if any change in neurological examination.
His blood pressure was under control, and did not require any pressors.
We decided to send out a LAP (leucocyte alkaline phosphatase) score which came back normal at 40 as well as a BCR-ABL translocation [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome to look for CML, and this was pending on discharge.
We checked a urine culture which initially showed MRSA, however, he was asymptomatic, and so we decided to repeat the culture as this may have been a contaminant.
Endocrinology was also consulted, and they recommend to repeat a thyroid ultrasound and repeat the fine needle aspiration of the thyroid as well.
We discussed with the family that some point in the future he may need a repeat bone marrow biopsy to be considered for evaluation for myeloproliferative disorder, but at this time he can be followed closely by hematologist.
He will also need a repeat urinalysis if his symptoms worsen and a urine culture that was sent on [**5-26**] will need to be re-evaluated for growth, however, it was pending on discharge.
He did have a previous urine culture that was positive, however, this may be indeed a contaminant as he was asymptomatic.
