PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, heart rate 100, blood pressure 100/50, sedated and intubated.
Tachycardic, S1, S2 with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is admitted to Medical Intensive Care Unit for further observation of respiratory distress.
On hospital day #2, the patient underwent bronchoscopy which revealed multiple hemorrhagic metastases extending through the large portion of the bronchial tree.
As there were no more therapeutic options available from an oncologic or airway standpoint, all were in agreement that it would be in the best interest for the patient to pursue a nonaggressive approach.
