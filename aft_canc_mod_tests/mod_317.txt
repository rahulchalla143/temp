The family was involved in initial evaluation in the Emergency Room and requested full workup.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.7.
Pulse 71.

Pelvic ultrasound showed a uterus 4.8 by 4.3 by 3 cm with thickened endometrial strip of 8 mm.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Service for further workup of her vaginal bleeding.
She had a cystogram that day, which showed no vesicouterine fistula.
She also underwent cystoscopy on [**11-28**], which showed a bladder mass, however, a biopsy was not done.
On [**11-28**] at approximately 12:00 p.m. the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation in the 140s and her respiratory rate increased into the 50s with a slight drop in her O2 saturation.
The planned bladder and endometrial biopsy were postponed.
She did not respond to fluid boluses and her heart rate.
Arterial blood gas was 7.36, 25 and 73 with a lactate of 7.6.
Her INR had also increased to 3.3.
A CT scan was able, however, the patient did not tolerate the gastrogram.
Workup in the Intensive Care Unit included a CT scan of the abdomen, which was consistent with ischemic bowel disease in the small bowel and right colon.
The MICU team had extensive discussions with the family about the patient's prognosis given her multiple problems including esophageal cancer, possible bladder cancer, ischemic bowel disease and history of stroke as well as her rising INR despite vitamin K.  The patient required pressor support while in the Intensive Care Unit.
By [**11-29**] her INR had increased to 5.8 and hematuria and vaginal bleeding continued.
Her blood cultures subsequently were positive for gram positive coxae and gram negative rods.
