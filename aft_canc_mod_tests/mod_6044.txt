ENT evaluation revealed recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis as the etiology and recommendations for CT scan of chest and neck were made.
During clinic visit on [**2156-3-25**], plan was to further look into radiation therapy as treatment, as well as to perform full staging with magnetic resonance scan of the head as well as bone scan.
Findings from the magnetic resonance scan and bone scan revealed no metastases.
Echocardiogram was significant for a circumferential pericardial effusion, right ventricular diastolic collapse and thickening of the visceral pericardium.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature 99.2, heart rate 101, blood pressure 120/72, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 97% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly, subxiphoid drain in place, clean, dry and intact.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 7.5, hematocrit 32.7, platelets 304,000.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate 23, blood urea nitrogen 15, creatinine 1.0, glucose 99.
Magnesium 2.1.
Prothrombin time 13.6, partial thromboplastin time 29.0, INR 1.1.
Pericardial fluid with a total protein of 6.2, LDH 3960, albumin 3.6, glucose 34, amylase 33 and culture and cytology were pending.
Electrocardiogram #1 showed normal sinus rhythm in the 80s, first degree AV block, normal axis, PR depression diffusely with ST elevations diffusely.
Electrocardiogram #2 post pericardiocentesis showed sinus tachycardia, rate 100s, first degree AV block, normal axis, and new right bundle branch block, T wave inversions in V1 through V2 and ST depressions in V1 through V3.
Echocardiogram prior to pericardiocentesis showed left ventricular ejection fraction within normal limits, sustained right atrial collapse consistent with low filling pressures, left atrial collapse consistent with significant elevation of intrapericardial pressures, right ventricular diastolic collapse, thickening of the visceral pericardium.
Right heart catheterization showed a cardiac output of 4.97, cardiac index of 2.55, pulmonary artery pressures of 27/16, right ventricular pressures of 32/11, wedge pressure of 19, right atrial pressure of 12.
Pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of approximately 500 ccs of bloody fluid.
Cardiac - Pericardium - Pericardial drain was left in overnight on hospital day number one.
Echocardiogram performed on hospital day number two had the following findings:  The left atrium was normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
Cytology of the pericardial fluid was analyzed and was subsequently noted to be positive for malignant cells consistent with metastatic carcinoma.
Ischemia - The patient with no known coronary artery disease nor an signs or symptoms of ischemic heart disease during the hospital stay.
Pump - As above, the patient with an ejection fraction of greater than 55% and was not noted to have any congestive heart failure signs or symptoms requiring diuresis.
Renal - The patient's creatinine remained stable and at his baseline during the hospital stay.
Hematology - The patient's hematocrit dropped slightly from a value on [**2156-3-25**], however, remained stable during the hospital stay requiring no transfusions.
Follow-up appointment at the echocardiographic laboratory on [**2156-4-14**], for repeat echocardiogram to evaluate for fluid reaccumulation.
