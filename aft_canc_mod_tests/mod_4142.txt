Imaging: CXR ([**2191-11-4**]): Bedside AP examinations labeled "semi-upright at 4:30 p.m. and "5 p.m." are compared with the bedside examination done some two hours earlier; the overall appearance is unchanged.
CTA ([**2191-11-4**]): 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
While in the unit, he had negative enzymes x 2, suggesting his EKG changes may have been secondary to demand ischemia given his low hematocrit.
He had a CTA which was negative for pulmonary embolus.
