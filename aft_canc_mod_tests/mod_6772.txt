An abdominal ultrasound showed evidence of acute cholecystitis.
An abdominal CT was performed which showed an enhancing adrenal mass, a hepatic mass (likely a cyst), and a hypodense splenic lesion.
Of note, she had a potassium of 2.3 on presentation to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] (she has a long-standing history of hypokalemia).
Urinalysis was consistent with UTI.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn.
At [**Hospital1 18**] on transfer, she was afebrile with HR 98, BP 146/80, RR 18, Sat 98% on 2L NC.

A son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign was elicited during the examination.
[**2103-2-22**] MRI:  *** Limited study The examination is limited due to inability to cooperate with breath-hold imaging and absence of contrast administration.

Lung exam revealed wheezes, and she was started on ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers with good response.
On [**2103-2-21**], vancomycin was discontinued; she defervesced and had improvement of her leukocytosis on zosyn (WBC from 25.2 on [**2-17**] to 6.6 on discharge).
Of note, all blood cultures were negative throughout the admission.
It was noted that her gallbladder was distended, filled with stones and sludge.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] records, K+ has been low as far back as [**2094**], with a baseline between 3.0 and 3.8.
She was discharged on potassium chloride 40 mEq QD, with suggestion to check potassium levels Q2 - 3 days initially in rehab.
Aldosterone, renin and ACTH levels were pending at the time of discharge, although it is noted that spironolactone administration may prevent proper interpretation of these results.
ADRENAL MASS: Records from her prior endocrinologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and previous CT scans show that this adrenal mass was known previously.
Comparison to prior studies seemed to show that the mass was stable in size.
Cortisol level was 44 on admission, and aldosterone, renin and ACTH levels were pending at the time of discharge.
MRI of the abdomen was ordered for further evaluation and showed the adrneal mass was consistent with an adenoma.
We have recommended out-patient evaluation and appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for further work-up and management.
PENDING ISSUES FOR FOLLOW-UP (1) Potassium levels should be checked every 2 - 3 days initially upon discharge to ensure that the patient's potassium level remains stable on 40 mEq KCl daily supplementation.
(2) Blood pressure should be followed, as HCTZ were held in the hospital because of relatively low blood pressures.
The need for repeat imaging and further work-up shoud be determined by the PCP and endocrinologist.
In addition, the aldosterone, ACTH, renin, testosterone and DHEA-S levels were pending at the time of discharge and should be reviewed as an out-patient to ensure there have been no changes since they were last measured.
You have been on a supplement in the past and were restarted on this because your potassium levels were low in the hospital.
