His hematocrit dipped as low as 24% and he received 7 units of packed RBCs over the 4 day course of his hospitalization.
The patient underwent a flex sigmoidoscopy with the GI service on the day of admission which showed "Clotted and fresh blood was seen in the rectum, distal sigmoid colon, distal descending colon, splenic flexure and distal transverse colon.
Protruding Lesions, Medium non-bleeding grade [**1-12**] internal & external hemorrhoids with skin tags were noted."
He was also seen by the urology service in followup to the prostate biopsy and as it was felt the bleeding was due to the hemorrhoids seen on scope and not bleeding from the biopsy, they had no further intervention at this time.
His hematocrit was stable [**4-28**] and [**4-29**] and he was discharged to home, tolerating diet, ambulating and having no evidence of current/active bleeding.
