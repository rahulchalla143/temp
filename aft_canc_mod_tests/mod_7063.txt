She was placed on a nonrebreather and her O2 saturations responded to 95 percent.
At the time she also elevated systolic blood pressure of 215 and an EKG with T wave inversions and ST depressions anteriorly in V1 through V3 which were new.
She then became hypotensive likely in response to the aggressive blood pressure management, although her EKG changes did resolve with decreased blood pressure and was transferred to the [**Last Name (un) 100649**] Intensive Care Unit on a dopamine drip.
CT angiogram of the chest showed no evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Chest x-ray and examination were consistent with some amount of pulmonary edema likely from the intravenous fluids she had received in the post anesthesia care unit for her hypotension.
Additionally chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with mild ARDS secondary to the talc pleurodesis (the talc embolus syndrome which is a known side effect and complication of the procedure).
Chest tube was discontinued on the 27th and the patient has continued to do well and her O2 requirement has decreased although her chest x-ray remains with bilateral infiltrates and pleural reaction to the talc pleurodesis.
Final stains of the cytology cell blocks from patient's malignant pleural effusion were positive for cytokeratin 7, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTS-1) and focally for cytokeratin 20.
She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 16212**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on the morning of discharge for further outpatient management.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction and EKG changes resolved with control of her blood pressure and heart rate.
Blood pressure:  The patient at baseline has hypertension.
However, her blood pressure has since returned to her elevated baseline and her metoprolol has been restarted and titrated upward so that she is now back on 100 p.o.
With the presence of an interpreter, attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and I spoke with the patient, asked her if she had any questions about any of the tests that were done while she was in the hospital.
Requires assistance with ambulance secondary to her prolonged hospital stay but her O2 sats are improving.
Bronchoscopy on [**2170-5-17**].
