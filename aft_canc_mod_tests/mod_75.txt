Briefly, this is a 72 year old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic gastric cancer (tolerating adriamycin after failing multiple regimens), localized prostate cancer, bilateral cephalic vein thromboses in the setting of coumadin therapy in [**2148-4-9**], and portacath thrombus in [**2148-1-11**] who presented with four days of dark stools and hematocrit drop from 37 to 24, and intermittent abdominal pain and nausea, after being discharged to nursing facility on [**5-13**] on chronic lovenox therapy.
However, after the procedure the patient continued to have bleeding and an angiography was performed.
He was transfused a total of 4 U PRBC per the blood bank record, the last one on [**5-20**].
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.

[**5-19**] EKG Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2148-5-6**] the rate is normal.
[**5-23**] MRI MRI OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of acute brain ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage.
Low lung volumes may accentuate vascular structures.
[**5-23**] CT Head FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or infarction.
Small hypodensities in bilateral thalami may be old lacunes and were present on head CT, [**2148-1-24**].
Again, please note that non-contrast head CT is relatively insensitive for detection of metastatic disease and contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended if this is a clinical concern.
[**5-26**] RUE U/S FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, and right brachial veins demonstrate normal compressibility and waveforms.
Examination of the contralateral internal jugular vein and subclavian vein also demonstrates normal waveforms and compressibility.
The right cephalic vein is not imaged on this examination and likely remains clotted.
Hematocrit noted to have decreased from 36.8 on [**5-15**] to 23.8 on admission.
Hct continued to trend down and he was transfused several units of PRBCS.
His hct continued to trend down thereafter, and he was therefore transferred to Angiography for embolization therapy, which he received on [**2148-5-21**].
His hct has been stable since that procedure.
#) Prior MSSA infection: Blood cultures on [**5-6**] grew MSSA in [**3-13**] bottles.
Urinalysis and chest xray negative.
TTE negative for vegetations and TEE deferred.
Given his prior history of deep vein thrombosis, upper extremity ultrasounds were obtained and notable for bilateral cephalic vein DVTs.
His INR was therapeutic on admission, but in late [**Month (only) 547**], subtherapuetic for short period.
His creatinine did not change with IVF and no renal abnormalities were found on renal ultrasound.
His serum chemistries should be checked approximately every other day until stable and continued on potassium supplementation until his potassium is stable.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for heartburn.
This bleed was from being on a blood thinner.
