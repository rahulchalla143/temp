A CXR showed a left pleural effusion and LLL atelectasis.
Over the next 2 days, her blood cultures from the ED grew gram negative rods.
A CTA of her chest showed no evidence of a PE but increasing bilateral pleural effusions.
CT scan confirmed a colonic perforation with stool and PO contrast in the abdominal cavity.
Continued drainage, however, prompted re-evaulation of the entire wound in the operating room which was found to be intact.
She tolerated jejunal tube feeds and bedside and video swallow evaluation showed some risk of aspiration which is controlled via chin tuck maneuver.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sigmoid-rectal perforation.
