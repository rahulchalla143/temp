Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-7-8**] ST segment depressions are more prominent in the high lateral leads and the rate is faster.
Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 97	166	100	380/444	52	6	133 Pertinent imaging:  Echo ([**2140-7-18**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Upper extremity doppler ([**7-20**]): official result pending   Brief Hospital Course: 57 y/o male with hx ESRD with melanotic stools since starting dialysis.
The patient had a hct of 16.2 on admission and was transfused to a goal Hct of 30 due to CAD history.
An initial EGD showed multiple ulcers in antrum and pylorus without clear signs of bleeding.
Biopsy was not performed since patient was on plavix.
He was transferred to the floor on [**7-18**] after his HCT remained stable X24hours.
He underwent repeat EGD and c-scope  on [**7-18**].
He will need [**Hospital1 **] PPI for 6weeks at least with GI follow-up for possible repeat scope to ensure resolution since he will need lifelong plavix +/-ASA.
He did recieve his last unit prbc on day of discharge to keep HCT near 30.
Of note, at time of discharge, it was noted that his H.pylori serology that was previously negative had turned postiive by EIA, thus he was contact[**Name (NI) **] and Rx for clarithro and amox X2weeks was added (already on PPI [**Hospital1 **]) for triple therapy.
He underwent an Echo with showed anteroseptal WMA (mid LAD distribution) and it is unclear whether this is new/old (reversible or fixed).
He had an infectious w/u which had negative cultures and subsequently Vancomycin was stopped.
He underwent a doppler which showed OLD/Chronic nonocclusive DVTs of brachial and basillic veins and a NEW occlusive DVT of axillary vein which is likely reason for the new swelling.
Repeat dopplers in 2weeks are recommended to rule out extension of the clot.
Stay on your coreg twice a day (have decreased dose to 12.5 so your blood pressure can handle) and lipitor 80mg daily and cozaar 100mg daily.
You need a repeat ultrasound in 2weeks to see if the new clot has opened up like the old ones.
