In the ED, the patient was found to be anemic with a Hct of 21.1 (baseline Hct in the high 20s to low 30s).
CXR noted for PNA and started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone.
She was then admitted to the MICU for close monitoring of her blood sugars.
It was felt that the patient's PNA was not clear on CXR but treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin was continued.
The team considered obtaining a CT but this was not persued.
GI was consulted but plans to do an outpatient EEG and colonoscopy if the patient remains stable.
