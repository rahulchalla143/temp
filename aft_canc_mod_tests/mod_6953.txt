Initial treament included placing 2 large bore PIVs and hemodynamic monitoring.
Per GI consult, she had a colonoscopy on [**2186-1-25**] which revealed continued bleeding to the ileum without an obvious lesion.
Thus an EGD was performed on [**2186-1-26**] which did not reveal an upper GI source of bleeding.
A dudenal polyp was found and was sent for biopsy.
On discharge, her hct remained stable.
