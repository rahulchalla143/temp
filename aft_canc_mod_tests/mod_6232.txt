CTA/CTV/CT Torso were performed for surgical planning and cancer staging.
She also had a PET scan which showed the known cerebellar mass with invasion of the adjacent skull.
She was then transferred back to the ICU for close monitoring overnight.
She had an MRI which showed slow diffusion seen at the margin of the lesion and medially could be secondary to surgical procedure or to an associated small infarct.
