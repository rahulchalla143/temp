Onc history: -  Left-sided neck adenopathy biopsied in [**5-/2122**]: Hodgkin disease with flow cytometry noted for monoclonal B cells which were CD5 positive,raising the possibility of CLL.
-  CT on [**2127-1-20**] revealed a left pleural mass with biopsy consistent with relapsed classical Hodgkin lymphoma status post ABVD X 6 cycles with complications of neutropenia, necessitating the use of Neupogen, rapid atrial fibrillation, and bleomycin toxicity along with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].

LFTs, Dbili, WBC trended down steadily.
Blood cultures sent and were negative.
BP remained stable throughout episode.
EKG showed some ST depressions (troponin and CKMB negative).
Repeat EKG was unchanged from EKG prior to Afib w/ RVR episode, no ST depressions.
Abdominal pain was controlled and patient was monitored on telemetry.
Pt was instructed to have a repeat CBC at his PCP's office [**2133-12-29**].
Pt's HCT was monitored closely and remained stable for 5 days (~HCT 30) prior to discharge.
Upon discharge, pt was instructed to continue holding his ASA and have a repeat HCT drawn on [**12-29**] at his PCP's office.
HCT 31.5 on day of DC.
Transitional Issues: -repeat CBC and LFTs at PCP's office.
Outpatient Lab Work LFTs, bilirubin and CBC on [**2133-12-29**] at Dr.[**Hospital1 6460**] office.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of abdominal pain and were found to have an infection (cholangitis) and stones in your bile ducts.
You also had a sphincterotomy (area of narrowing was opened).
However, your blood count has been stable for 5 days.
The GI doctors did not feel that there were any further interventions that needed to occur.
Medication changes: 1.stop your aspirin until instructed to restart by your PCP after your blood counts are rechecked.
