There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
[**2193-8-24**]:  chest x-ray:   Evidence of failure with pulmonary plethora and a left effusion again seen, essentially unaltered since the prior chest x-ray.
Radiographic images from the OSH demonstrated free air and leakage of contrast from the bowel.
He received fluid resuscitation and was taken to the operating room where he had an exploratory laparotomy and resection of the small bowel.
His operative course was stable with a 100cc blood loss.
Blood cultures were sent.
An echocardoigram was done to evaluate his cardiac status.
Recommendations included ECHO 1 month after discharge, bridging from heparin to coumadin, and rate-control with beta-blockade.
His fever persisted with a rising white blood cell count and he was started on vancomycin and fluconazole.
His blood and urine cultures showed no growth.
After his gastric output decreased, the [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube was removed on POD #3.
A stool culture was sent and it was negative for c.diff.
A chest x-ray was done which showed left lobe residual opacity suggestive of ateletasis.
His oxygen saturation improved and he has been maintained on room air with an oxygen saturation of  100%.
He has completed his course of antibiotics on [**8-28**] but continues to have an elevated white blood cell count of 18,000-20,000.
