Past Medical History: 1) [**10/2179**] optimal debulking serous ovarian carcinoma w/removal of omental caking and drainage of ascitic fluid (2.5 L) 2) [**10/2179**] pleural effusion 3) s/p 1 cycle Taxol/Carboplatin w/mild response and 2 cycles Docagem (Docataxel, Carboplatin, Gemcitabine) w/excellent response (CA-125 nadir 7.5) 4) [**12/2180**] Recurrence, s/p 3 cycles Taxol/Carboplatin, followed by complete remission (6 months between remission).
Brief Hospital Course: The patient underwent EUA, ELAP, drainage of ascites, small bowel resection with ileal ascending colon anastomosis, transverse loop colostomy, tumor debulking, and bilateral ureteral catheterization on [**2184-3-1**].
1) CV: The patient went to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hemodynamic monitoring secondary to hypotension during the procedure and extensive fluid shifts.
Her blood pressure was initially  maintained on a neosynephrine drip, which was d/c'd on POD1.
An EKG was obtained and was notable for possible anterior Q waves as well as poor R wave progression.
An Echocardiogram was notable for mild left atrial dilation.
Lower extremity dopplers were normal.
Her D-Dimer was elevated at 3279.
A chest x-ray on POD#8 revealed LL lobe effusion/atelectasis.
A V/Q scan demonstrated intermediate probability of PE.
The output from the right ureteral catheter remained low and she was evaluated by urology on POD 2.
A renal ultrasound was obtained and revealed no hydronephrosis.
Her creatinine decreased from 1.7 preop to 1.0.
Her urine output improved.
3) Heme: The pt received a total of 5U PRBCs to maintain her HCT above 30.
Her INR increased to 1.9.
It improved to 1.3 with Vitamin K but her PT remained elevated in the 14-15 range.
Her wound culture and blood cultures were negative.
Her WBC decreased from 30 to 12, but increased to 20 on POD 7.
