Admission Date: [**2147-6-5**]        Discharge Date: [**2147-6-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-5-15**]        Sex:  M  Service:  GU   INDICATIONS:  This is a 50-year-old male who was noted to have gross painless hematuria and his workup demonstrated a 13-17 cm right renal mass extending into the right renal vein and extending beyond the right renal vein and into the infrahepatic inferior vena cava.
His metastatic workup revealed pulmonary and mediastinal metastases.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's pulse was 84; his blood pressure was 163/77; his respirations was 16; and his O2 saturation of 95% on room air.
His chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT X-RAYS, EKGS, AND OTHER TESTS:  CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a large right renal mass with invasion of the right renal vein extension through carotid fascia, extensive collateralization and deformation of the right psoas muscle, persistent pulmonary emboli on the left pulmonary artery, and sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Patient, though, received 9 units of packed red blood cells during the course of the operation.
On postop day #2, patient was transfused 2 more units of packed red blood cells for, once again, a hematocrit of under 25.
We repeated a CTA of the chest which revealed no worsening of the known pulmonary embolus.
He was also started on Lovenox at a dose for treatment of known PE, but he remained stable with a hematocrit of 25.1.
