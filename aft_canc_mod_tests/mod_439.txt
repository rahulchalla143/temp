He reported pain in the left hip and was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Once at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient underwent a trauma evaluation for his fall.
He was reporting pain and given 4 mg of morphine  at 5:55 pm for his discomfort, then 50 mg bendadryl at 6:04 pm for subsequent itchiness.
An attempt to perform CT scan was made around this time (~6 pm), but the patient was sent back as he was becoming increasingly confused and unable to sit still.
He received the CT of the head at 7:45 pm and a code stroke was called at 8:13 pm after a preliminary read of a right middle cerebral artery stroke.

Carotid US [**3-31**]: No evidence of internal carotid artery stenosis in their extracranial portion.
Renal US [**3-31**]: 1.
MRI HEAD [**3-31**]: 1.
Echocardiogram [**4-2**]: The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-7-16**], left ventricular systolic function is less vigorous.
Code stroke was called after a head CT concerning for R MCA infarct and his examination was limited, given an acute confusional state with left upgoing toe is the only clear localizing finding at the time.
He was out of the window for intervention and vessel imaging and contrast studies were risky given his degree of renal failure.
Patient was admitted to neurology service and he underwent pelvis study to rule out hip fracture and renal US to rule out renal obstruction.
GI recommended colonoscopy for risk stratification - bowel prep was extremely difficult.
After several days of clear diet and several rounds of golytely, he underwent colonoscopy on [**4-7**] which showed a few polyps but no contra-indication for anticoagulation hence he was started on Coumadin with [**Month/Year (2) **] bridging ([**Month/Year (2) **] to be stopped once INR therapeutic between 2~3).
His INR will be followed up per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8499**], PCP.
He had repeat echocardiogram that showed even more reduced EF of 20~25% and signs of infiltrative disease hence SPEP and UPEP were checked that appeared within normal range.
He will be following up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] at the heart failure clinic.

You will need frequent INR checks while on Coumadin.
Because of atrial fibrillation, stroke and heart failutre, you were started on a blood thinning medication called Warfarin which will need close blood checks after undergoing colonoscopy to assess for gastro-intestinal bleeding risk.
You will need to follow-up with your primary care physician this coming Tuesday, [**4-8**] at 12:15pm where he will check your INR (goal [**1-14**]) and adjust your Warfarin dose accordingly.
You will likely need your INR blood level checked at least twice or thrice weekly until your PCP instructs you otherwise.
Given your heart failure and low ejection fraction, please weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
