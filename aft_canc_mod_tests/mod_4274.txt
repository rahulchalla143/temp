Lumbar puncture was negative for infection.
Hypoxia and fever resolved, so he was transfered out of ICU on IV valproate and antibiotics possible for aspiration pneumonia, though CXRs x2 and cultures were negative.
Brain MRI [**2103-7-25**] showed progression of CNS disease.
MRI [**2103-7-24**] showed progression of disease.
EEG [**2103-7-24**] prelim report showed improvement of the severe diffuse background slowing seen on the previous EEGs [**2103-7-19**] and [**2103-7-20**], but the focal slowing and occasional sharp waves over the right temporal region associated with his tumor remain unchanged.
With little down side to a trial of steroids especially considering progression of CNS disease, dexamethasone 4mg IV q8hr was restarted [**2103-7-26**].
Restaging MRI showed progression of disease.

He also had a lumbar puncture (spinal tap), which did not show an infection.
Chest x-rays and cultures have not revealed any infection.The  low oxygen levels improved, and Mr [**Known lastname 13013**] was transfered out of the ICU.
A brain MRI showed progression of the tumor, the likely cause of confusion and seizures.
Because of continued progression of disease avastin treatment was discontinued and care now focusing on keeping patient comfortable.Mr [**Known lastname 13013**] did develop an increase in bowel movements and because of prior history of clostridium difficile colitis stool cultures were obtained and patient was started on oral vancomycin empirically.
