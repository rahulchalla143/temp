In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.3, HR 109, BP 161/115, RR 40, O2 Sat 97% with neb.
A CTA was performed and prelim read was no PE.
However, the study showed new mediastinal lymphadenopathy causing lingular and left upper lobe collapse as well as a destructive lesion centered in the right third rib with invasion into the adjacent anterior chest wall and pulmonary parenchyma.
There, she underwent flexible bronchoscopy which showed that the right upper lobe was completely occluded with tumor, and also revealed tumor in the left mid main-stem bronchus with bronchomalacia of the left mainstem that resulted in complete occlusion of the airway on exhalation.
She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for rigid bronchoscopy, which was performed on [**2170-1-25**].
She improved with suction; however, a portable chest x-ray showed severe atelectasis of the right upper lobe as well as continued near white-out of the left side, now with even fewer visible lung markings and a more obscured hemidiaphragm.
-- History of positive RPR with normal CSF -- Thrombocytopenia -- Colonic adenoma by colonoscopy in [**2167**] -- s/p left lower extremity venous stripping -- Abdominal wall abscess -- History of deep venous thrombophlebitis [**5-/2157**].
Mother: s/p pacer, lymphoma  Physical Exam: Vitals - HR 89 BP 127/75 RR 26 O2 89% on cool neb oxygen (79-80 on 2.5L when triggered by RN on onc floor) General - SOB, labored breathing, using accessory muscles of respiration, not able to use voice, mouthing sentences Neck - + anterior cervical lymphadenopathy CV - distant heart sounds, no appreciable murmur Lungs - extremely loud low-pitched ronchi, unclear air movement through most of lung fields (i.e., most sounds are projected upper airway sounds), some air movement at lower right) Abdomen - soft, NT/ND, BS+  Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2170-1-23**] CXR - Opacity involving the entire left lobe of the lung is concerning for left lobe destruction.
[**2170-1-23**] CTA - 1.
[**2170-1-29**] CXR - verbal report only: significant atelectasis/collapse of RUL; worsening of opacity and more obscure hemidiaphragm on left.
Micro: [**2169-1-23**] Blood - pending   Brief Hospital Course: 58 yo F with HIV, small cell lung cancer, and HTN admitted with SOB.
There, she underwent flexible bronchoscopy which showed that the right upper lobe was completely occluded with tumor, and also revealed tumor in the left mid main-stem bronchus with bronchomalacia of the left mainstem that resulted in complete occlusion of the airway on exhalation.
She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for rigid bronchoscopy, which was performed on [**2170-1-25**].
She improved with suction; however, a portable chest x-ray showed severe atelectasis of the right upper lobe as well as continued near white-out of the left side, now with even fewer visible lung markings and a more obscured hemidiaphragm.
She was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where a bronchoscopy was performed and a large mucous plug was removed.
# C Diff - Treated with Flagyl x 14 day course with result of diarrhea improvement.
CD4 171, VL 32K ([**12-31**]).
She was switched to metoprolol at the time of admission for better blood pressure control.
