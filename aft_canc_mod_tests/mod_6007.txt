He had an MRI showing a right temporal tumor enlarged when compared to MRI done in [**6-/2170**] when he had a CVA.
EEG showed no seizures at the time of recording.
He also had an ECHO and carotid US.
A recent Persantine myocardial perfusion study negative for any fixed or reversible defects.
History of mild mitral regurgitation by remote echocardiography, but most recent study did not reveal any significant valvular abnormalities.
No pronator drift Sensation: Intact to light touch bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: MRI Head [**9-18**]  Surgical planning study showing an extra-axial mass, which homogeneously enhances in the area of the right temporal lobe.
CT Head [**9-18**] Post op Status post resection of right frontal meningioma with postoperative pneumocephalus and small amount of hemorrhage.
There is resulting edema with effacement of the right suprasellar cistern, which could indicate an impending uncal herniation  CXR [**2172-9-19**] The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Lung volumes are low with crowding at the bases.
EEG [**2172-9-20**] This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of continuous focal slowing, attenuation of faster frequencies, frequent epileptiform discharges in the right centroparietal region, and frequent electrographic seizures over the right frontotemporal region.
Compared to the prior day's recording, electrographic seizures have increased in frequency, but the background activity is unchanged.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2172-9-24**] New hypodensity in the right MCA territory.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2172-9-25**] : IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI Head [**2172-9-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR portable [**9-28**] 1.
CXR portable [**9-28**] for line placement: Repositioned right PICC terminating at the superior cavoatrial junction.
CXR portalbe [**9-29**]: improved left basilar atelectasis, stable rightsided atelectasis  CXR portable [**9-30**]: stable appearance of lungs compared with prior xray  CXR Portable [**10-1**]:SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST: A nasogastric tube again passes into the stomach and off the inferior margin of the film.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2172-10-1**] 1:37 PM FINDINGS: There is persistent hypodensity in the right operculum, consistent with evolution of infarct in the right MCA territory.
CXR [**10-3**] The tip of the nasogastric tube and side port are below the gastroesophageal junction appropriately sited.
LENIs [**10-5**] - negative for DVT  CXR [**2172-10-7**] 1.
11/17 L foot x ray  1.
An EEG was ordered along with a keppra 750mg bolus and his daily dose was increased to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
He had a speech and swallow exam on [**9-21**] and he was not cleared for a PO diet.
His diet [**Last Name (un) 19692**] advance to puree/nectar thick after Swallow exam on [**9-23**].
EEG was negative for seizure activity for 24 hours and the leads were discontinuued.
Overnight 11/2-3 he was agitated and needed restraints.
CT head showed a right sided stroke and he was transfered to the ICU.
MRI head and stroke workup pending.
Repeat head CT performed overnight for increased lethargy showed stable stoke.
EEG was negative for seizure activity.
On [**9-26**] the patient's neurological exam was improving.
Echo was negative and carotid u/s revealed 60-65% stenosis in Right ICA.
Patient's keppra was decreased from 1250 to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] and EEG over the weekend were negative for seizure activity.
His exam was stable with EO to noxious stimuli and following commands in all 4 extremities.
On [**9-30**] a speech and swallow exam was attempted however the patient was too lethargic to fully cooperate and so it was defered.
On [**10-1**] he was lethargic and CT showed evolving CVA .He remained in the unit.
PT and OT were consulted for assistance with discharge planning.A chest xray was performed which was consistent no new relevant changes in the lungs.
Lung volumes are low.
On [**10-1**], A Head CT was performed due to lethargy which was consistent with evolving right MCA infarct, no evidence of mass effect or intracranial hemorrhage.
A chest Xray was performed which was stable.
LENIs was obtained on [**10-5**] which demonstrated no DVT.
ACS was called and a STAT HCt was sent, this was 31.3 then 30.8.
CXR ruled out pneumothroax with some mild pneumoperitoneum from his procedure.
You will need an MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast.
