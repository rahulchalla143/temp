A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed mild dilatation of the common bile duct status post cholecystectomy as well as a heterogenous liver which was a non-specific finding.
The patient was scheduled for possible endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography and had spiked a low grade temperature up to 101.6 F., with white count rising from 5 to 21.
Blood cultures from [**2-20**] were subsequently no growth to date.
The patient's O2 saturations decreased to 50% on room air, increasing to the mid 80s on a non- rebreather.
The patient was given Narcan times two, but the arterial blood gas revealed the following numbers:  7.28, 56 and 76.
Chest x-ray revealed new focal left lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient had crackles in the left lower lobe and she was given intravenous Lasix with 1.0 liters of urine output.
Due to the patient's aortic stenosis, the patient's systolic blood pressures decreased to the mid-80s and she was brought to the Intensive Care Unit for management of her aspiration pneumonia and her hypotension.
The patient was initially volume resuscitated and was treated with Levaquin and Flagyl in addition to ampicillin both for her enterococcal urinary tract infection as well as for the aspiration pneumonia.
Chest x-ray revealed mild congestive heart failure and a worsening of her aspiration.
Arterial blood gas revealed the following numbers:  7.21; 72; 90 on 100% non-rebreather.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit once again for hypotension with systolic blood pressures as low as 60, and worsening mental status in the setting of an aspiration event.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pulse 110; blood pressure 89/32; 20 respiratory rate; 96% on non-rebreather.
Cardiac examination with a III/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 17.3, hematocrit 31.7, platelets 141, INR 1.5, sodium 136, potassium 3.7, chloride 101, bicarbonate 27, BUN 12, creatinine 1.0, glucose 110.
ALT 25, AST 22, LDH 218, alkaline phosphatase 116, total bilirubin 0.3, calcium 9.6, magnesium 1.6, lactate 1.3.
During the second Intensive Care Unit admission, the patient's systolic blood pressure was extremely low and the family had requested no heroic measures including cardioversion, intubation or pressors.
The pain service continued the patient on a Lidocaine drip for 48 hours in the Intensive Care Unit since there have been few studies which have revealed that 48 hours of Lidocaine infusion can cause the trigeminal ganglion be deactivated, resulting in substantial benefit in the patient's pain.
The patient's intravenous fluids were increased to D5 normal saline at 125 cc an hour with improvement in her urine output.
The patient's urine output would be monitored carefully on the floor.
The patient was started on TPN and a PICC line was to be placed to that effect.
If this does happen, the family has a strong desire to pursue Hospice level of care and does not wish the patient to have recurrent aspiration pneumonias, and understands that if her oral secretions cannot be controlled quite well with medical therapies due to her trigeminal neuralgia, that Hospice care would be preferable to recurrent aspiration events.
