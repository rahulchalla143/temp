He was found to have a Hct of 24.8 with a WBC of 7.7 and no bands.
He also had an INR of 3.3 on coumadin for afib.
His CXR showed a bibasilar opacities concerning for pneumonia.

Pertinent Results: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2129-5-29**] 5:50 AM, on admission  IMPRESSION: Questionable opacity in the right lower lobe versus patient positioning.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2129-5-29**] 8:06 AM IMPRESSION: 1) Right lower lobe pneumonia, and subtle opacity in the left lower lobe, which may represent early infiltrate versus atelectasis.

The gastroenterology service was consulted for EGD and colonoscopy which are planned.
His hypotension was felt to be secondary to hypovolemia and his blood pressure responded to IVF resuscitation.
The patient presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate to the 140-160s which responded well to IVF to the 100s.
It was felt that his rapid rate was either precipitated by his hypotension or the cause of it.
He was taking coumadin as an outpatient with a supratherapeutic INR of 3.3.
Despite this, his INR was 4.1 on the morning of transfer.
Blood cultures were obtained on [**5-29**] and are pending.
UGIB/Hematemesis: The pts hematocrit was cycled q12 hours and was stable in the 27-29 range, requiring no further transfusions.
An EGD was performed on hospital day three.
His hematocrit remained stable but he received one unit of PRBCs on hospital day six to support his volume.
Bibasilar pneumonia: As part of the pt's overall workup a CT scan of the torso was performed on hospital day 3.
After these interventions, his heart rate would decrease and remain relatively stable into the 90-100's for the next 24 hours.
[**Month/Year (2) 18048**] s/p renal transplant The pt.
The pt's creatinine remained stable even despite a CT torso with intravenous contrast (he was prehydrated with HCO3).
CAD/myocardial ischemia: Pt's EKG on presentation showed nonspecific ST depressions in the lateral leads with a prior EKG report noting nonspecific ST changes in the lateral leads as well but CE not elevated.
Repeat EKG on hospital day 2 showed resolution of ST depression.
Metastatic prostate and lung cancer/pain control/overall goals of care: The pt's CT of the chest showed a new mass consistent with metastatic lung cancer.
