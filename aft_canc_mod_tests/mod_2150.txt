CT examination at the outside hospital showed a 2.0 by 2.0 radiodense lesion in the right temporal lobe consistent with hemorrhage with mild mass effect.
Laboratories at the outside hospital were significant for sodium of 143, potassium 3.8, chloride 99, bicarbonate 9.0, blood urea nitrogen 19, creatinine 1.4 with a glucose of 156.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination upon admission to [**Hospital1 69**], the patient had vital signs of blood pressure 150/80 with a heart rate of 79, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 100% in room air.
Generally, his head examination was normocephalic and atraumatic.
His chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes and no rhonchi.
Neurologic examination showed the pupils 2.0 to 3.0 millimeters, briskly reactive.
On review of the magnetic resonance scan of the brain, the stroke service noted a large area of bleed in the right temporal lobe and two small enhancing lesions suggestive of tumor.
They suggested a further workup to discover the primary source of the tumor.
The patient was also seen by the respiratory service for a CT finding of nodular infiltrates in the right upper lobe.
Their assessment was that this was an inflammatory reaction likely due to aspiration.
This study was motivated both by the patient's family's description of a change in the patient's bowel habits and as part of the search for the primary source of the patient's brain lesions.
The urine output during the procedure was 1100 ccs.
Frozen section of this lesion showed high grade glioma with no definitive border seen around the lesion grossly.
As a S4 was heard on cardiac examination by the neuro-oncology attending, a CT angiogram was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolus.
This study was negative for pulmonary embolus.
