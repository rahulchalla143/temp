There he was found to have Hgb of 10 and WBC 2.2 whose values were the same a week later.
His PCP referred him to a hematologist who sent him for a CXR because he had a chronic, dry cough.
The CXR showed bilateral patchy infiltrate, but he had a chest CT to characterize it further.
Repeat CBC approximately one week prior to admission showed WBC of 22K with immature cells in the periphery.
He underwent a BMBx and afterwards complained of right leg pain and swelling.
His BMBx and peripheral flow cytometry returned which was consistent with APML.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
He is retired from working in Telecom at [**University/College **], quit smoking 40 years ago, occasional EtOH but quit for Lent, no illegal drugs   Family History:  Mother had breast CA in her 40s, father's side of family had Alcoholism; no other blood or oncologic disorders   Physical Exam: VS: T 100.7  bp 118/60 HR 114  RR 17  SaO2 96 RA  Wt 176.3 lbs GEN: Elderly man in NAD, awake, alert, making jokes HEENT: EOMI, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP moist and without lesion NECK: Supple, no JVD CV: Reg tachycardia, normal S1, S2.
Bilateral sock-line edema SKIN: warm skin NEURO: oriented x 3, normal attention, CN II-XII intact, [**4-12**] strength throughout, intact sensation to light touch PSYCH: appropriate .

The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %) secondary to hypo- to akinesis of the mid-distal anterior septum, apex, and distal lateral wall (anterior/inferior walls not well visualized).
Compared with the prior study dated [**2104-3-21**] (images reviewed), regional and global biventricular systolic function are similar.
Pulmonary pressures were measured but not reported on the prior echo (also mildly elevated then).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-3-22**], left ventricular systolic function is similar.
Cardiac catheterization ([**2104-3-19**])- COMMENTS: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normotension.
ECHO POST-DRAINAGE [**4-25**]: There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
#Pericardial tamponade: The patient was transferred to the CCU on [**2104-4-24**] in the setting of decreased blood pressures and echocardiographic evidence of pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Opening pressure was 28.
Repeat echo on [**4-25**] AM showed very small pericardial effusion.
CT chest [**4-16**] showed worsening of bilateral diffuse opacifications compared to prior, possibly due to further volume overload.
Creatinine was up to 3.6 from baseline 0.8 in the context of ATN from hypotension; it improved down to the 1?????
