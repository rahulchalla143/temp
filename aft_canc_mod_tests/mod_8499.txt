HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 50-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer status post autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2181**], who was readmitted to [**Hospital3 **] for an allo MUD BMT on [**8-4**].
Patient was admitted for allo-MUD BMT and subsequently developed congestive heart failure with an EF of 20% per echocardiogram on [**8-7**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the Intensive Care Unit, temperature 104.4, blood pressure 100/60, respiratory rate 32.
LABORATORY DATA:  Echocardiogram [**8-7**] with EF 20% and severe global HK, no valvular abnormalities, and moderately dilated left ventricle.
Echocardiogram [**8-11**]:  EF 30-35% with borderline pulmonary hypertension and trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
CBC upon admission to the ICU:  White count 0.1, hematocrit 25.7, platelets 36.
Sodium 126, potassium 4.3, bicarb 13, chloride 101, BUN 56, creatinine 3.9, glucose 145.
Upon discontinuation of dialysis, the patient's renal function continued to improve and at time of transfer to floor, she had a creatinine of 0.8, BUN of 65.
Patient's urine output is excellent off any type of diuretics.
Natrecor was discontinued on [**9-2**], and the patient subsequently autodiuresed very well with excellent urine output and currently has no renal issues except for elevated BUN, which is improving daily.
EF [**8-7**] of 20%, subsequently improved to 35% on [**8-11**] and patient had repeat echocardiogram on [**8-26**], which revealed an EF of approximately 40%.
Of note, the patient had a repeat echocardiogram on [**9-2**], which was suboptimal in quality as well.
Thus, at time of transfer to floor, the patient had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure, yet it is likely that her left ventricular ejection fraction is mildly reduced and a repeat echocardiogram is recommended to assess systolic function.
After weeks of intubation, patient was finally extubated, however, her hematocrit was not stable.
LDH peaked approximately 3500 with T bilirubin peak of approximately 4.3.
Blood smear was reviewed and patient was felt to have TTP (Of note, the patient never spiked fever or had recurrent acute renal failure).
Her hematocrit has been stable between 21 and 26.
Transfusion parameters are for hematocrit less than 22.
At time of transfer to the floor, patient's LDH and total bilirubin are trending down.
Platelet count stable between 12 and 26,000.
Platelet transfusion parameters are for platelet count less than 10,000 or evidence of gross bleeding.
Despite a diagnosis of TTP, it was felt safe to transfuse patient with platelets for less than 10,000 or evidence of gross bleed, however, the patient did not require any platelet transfusions since her diagnosis of TTP upon time of transfer to medical floor.
Her electrolyte abnormalities had improved and cause of mental status change was unclear.
A head CT was obtained to rule out an acute bleed; the CT of the head had returned negative for any acute process.
Subsequently, a MR head was performed with diffusion-weighted imaging to rule out other acute process.
Peripheral blood smear with fragmented schistocytes consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and TTP.
Of note on [**9-1**], she did have [**12-25**] positive blood cultures for ampicillin-sensitive Enterococcus from her Hickman catheter.
She has been receiving q.24-48 hour surveillance blood cultures to assess for bacteremia.
It is important to note that her steroids seemed to have played a significant role in her anxiety and mental status as well.
