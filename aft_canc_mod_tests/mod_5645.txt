[**12-29**] CT torso: IMPRESSION: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
All infectious workup was negative except for MRSA in a sputum culture.
TTE was performed which showed EF of 50% and no obvious vegetations.
Her WBC was 11 on discharge, which has been around 9 or 10 since admission, but there are no signs of infection.
Pt was treated emperically for a possible pneumonia with Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] though all cultures were negative and CXR without clear evidence of consolidation.
She still appears volume overload with peripheral edema, and HD is trying to remove fluid as blood pressure tolerates.
A temporary HD line was placed, and a few days later that was removed and a new HD tunneled line was placed.
All cultures were negative.
She is newly on nephrocaps as a vitamin supplement.
On the day of discharge, she had a c.diff test pending because of this diarrhea.
Her WBC were 11, which was only slightly above baseline.
Of note, on her home meds, lyrica and her temazepam were stopped to see if her mental status would improve.
HIT antibody was sent and was negative.
# Nutrition: An NGT was placed and tube feeds were started to give pt nutrition during this long ICU course.
INR trended down appropriatly and Coumadin was restarted.
She is in normal sinus rhythm with heart rates in the 80s-90s on discharge.
She also has a rib met seen on CT chest.
Pt also had an incident of contrast infiltration into left arm, which she is recovering from.
During your initial presentation, you required intubation and special medications to keep your blood pressure up.
Dialysis will continue to try to keep getting excess fluid off as your blood pressure tolerates.
The changes to your medications at this time are: - stopped lyrica and tempazepam - stopped wellbutrin - stopped atorvastatin (because of your liver) - stopped protonix (because of your platelets) - changed coumadin from 2 mg to 1.5 mg (your inr was 2.0 on discharge) - started insulin for high blood sugars - started midodrine for low blood pressures   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your rehab doctors.
