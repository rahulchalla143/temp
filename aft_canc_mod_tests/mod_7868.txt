Serial chest xrays showed the expected fluid progression in the cavity.
His preadmission Coumadin was started on [**2166-7-6**] at his home dose and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will follow his INR which was 1.2 on [**2166-7-8**].
Of note, his voice seemed a bit hoarse post op and he had a digital videostroboscopy performed on [**2166-7-8**] which showed an immobile left vocal cord.
In the interim he underwent a video swallow along with a complete speech and swallow exam which showed that although his vocal cords are not adducting fully, his laryngeal vestibule and epiglottis are functioning as expected and diet modification is not needed at this time.
Following completion of his swallow evaluation he was discharged to home on a regular diet and will have VNA services for cardiopulmonary assessment along with INR checks.
Information was obtained from Patient.
* Resume your Coumadin at your pre op dosing and the VNA will draw an INR on Friday with results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
