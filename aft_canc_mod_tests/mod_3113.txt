She had a bone marrow aspirate that showed an overwhelming cell type of dysplastic red cell maturation.
The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight at the outside hospital and her hematocrit rose to 28.4.
A chest x-ray was clear.
She has brothers in [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 10478**], and a cousin in [**Name (NI) 1110**], with whom she is close.
Vital signs: Temperature 99.5, heart rate 64, blood pressure 124/76, respiratory rate 24, and 92% on room air.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 1.6, hematocrit 29.5, platelet count 16.
White count differential:  60% neutrophils, 4% bands, 28% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 3% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 1 atypical, 1 metamyelocyte, 1 myelocyte, 333 nucleated RBCs.
Chem-7 as well as renal function was unremarkable as well as LFTs, which were within normal limits with the exception of a T bilirubin, which was elevated at 1.8, albumin was 3.7.
Uric acid was 5.9.
INR is 1.2.
Bone marrow biopsy at the outside hospital showed hypercellular marrow with only a rare megakaryocyte, infrequent white blood cell overwhelming cell type.
FISH chromosome and flow cytometry studies were done.
Patient received blood cell transfusions for hematocrit less than 25, and also received platelet transfusions for platelet count less than 20,000.
She did develop fevers on hospital day #8 in the setting of neutropenia with an ANC of 120.
Cultures were sent including blood, both central and peripheral, urine and stool cultures.
Serial Clostridium difficile tests were done, but were negative.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient had poor p.o.
However, the patient did have subsequent hematomas in her upper chest bilaterally, which were tender throughout her hospital stay.
Clostridium difficile tests were negative x3.
Patient was sent for an immediate head CT noncontrast, which did rule out any intracranial hemorrhage, but did show a significant left orbit hematoma superficially.
A followup CT of the orbits was done, which revealed no bleeding behind the globe or any compression of the globe.
Serial neuro examinations were within normal limits.
