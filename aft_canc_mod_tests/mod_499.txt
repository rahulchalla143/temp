PET-CT: [**2191-10-5**]: There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in the thickened esophagus, liver and multiple nodes including aortocaval consistent with metastatic disease.
There are FDG-avid right paraesophageal (SUVmax 12.9), right paratracheal (SUVmax 8.9), right hilar (SUVmax 5.5) and subcarinal nodes (SUVmax 15.2).
There are FDG-avid lymph nodes in the abdomen: right retrocrural (SUVmax 7.6), lesser curve of the stomach (SUVmax 7.3), paraortic ( SUVmax 11.7), and aortocaval (SUVmax 5.9).
Hematocrit was also at baseline.
In the MICU he underwent urgent upper endoscopy; however, this procedure was terminated as a large clot was visualized in the proximal esophagus.
His hct trended slowly downward but the patient remained hemodynamically stable  Hematology/Oncology was consulted and a PET-CT revealed metastatic disease.
