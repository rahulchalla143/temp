Imaging/Studies:  EKG ([**2108-8-12**]): Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response.
Echo ([**2108-8-13**]): There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, myelomonocytic antigens CD33, CD15, CD11c, CD64, CD56, and CD4.
T cells comprise 77% of lymphoid gated events, express mature lineage antigens, and have a helper-cytotoxic ratio of 2.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy ([**2108-8-12**]): DIAGNOSIS:  Markedly hypercellular bone marrow with involvement by acute monoblastic leukemia (FAB, M5a).
The white blood cell count appears markedly increased.
Platelet count appears normal; large forms are seen; giant forms are not present.
Differential count shows 12% neutrophils, 6% bands, 1% monocytes, 5% lymphocytes, 2% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 69% monoblasts, 3% myelocytes, 2% metamyelocytes.
Erythroid precursors are decreased and include occasional dyspoietic form.
Differential shows: 80% Blasts, <1% Promyelocytes, 2% Myelocytes, <1% Metamyelocytes, 6% Bands/Neutrophils, 0% Plasma cells, 4% Lymphocytes, 8% Erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
Location: INPATIENT    Cell culture was established to provide metaphase cells for chromosome analysis.
-------------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS-------------------   FISH evaluation for a MLL rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI MLL Dual Color, Break Apart Probe (Vysis) at 11q23 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
A MLL rearrangement is found in a subset of cases of ALL and AML, and is associated with oncogenic fusions between MLL and various partner genes.

FISH evaluation for a 7q deletion was performed with the Vysis D7S522/CEP7 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for D7S522 at 7q31 and CEP7 (D7Z1) (chromosome 7 alpha satellite DNA) at 7p11.1-q11.1 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
FISH evaluation for a 20q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI D20S108 Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 20q12 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
