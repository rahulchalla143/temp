[**2110-3-5**] GI BLEEDING STUDY IMPRESSION: No GI bleeding noted in the 100 minutes of the study.
[**2110-3-6**] CT ABD& PELVIS CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are small bilateral pleural effusions and dependent atelectasis.
Evaluation of the solid organs is limited without IV contrast.
There are a few gallstones but no CT evidence of acute cholecystitis.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter within the decompressed urinary bladder.
BONE WINDOWS: Wedge compression deformity of L3 is age indeterminate but sclerotic appearance suggests that it is chronic.
Wedge deformity of L3 is age indeterminate but given sclerotic appearance is probably chronic.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the splenic flexure.
Normal exam up to 3 hr and 20 min of the study, likely when the capsule was in the mid to distal small bowel.
Starting from 3 hr and 20 min until the end of the study at 8 hr, the lumen was filled with blood.
Normal exam up to 3 hr and 20 min of the study, likely when the capsule was in the mid to distal small bowel.
Starting from 3 hr and 20 min until the end of the study at 8 hr, the lumen was filled with blood.
TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.
Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
[**2110-3-14**] Meckel's Scan - negative .
Overall, the aneurysm sac measures up to approximately 5.6 cm in maximal axial diameter, which is slightly smaller than on the CT abdomen from [**2110-3-5**].
IMPRESSION: Wall-to-wall flow within the aorta status post aneurysm repair with slightly smaller size of aneurysmal sac compared to prior CT torso.
SBFT [**3-18**] FINDINGS: An initial scout image of the abdomen demonstrates the outline of several aortic and iliac stents.
Following the administration of oral thin barium overhead and fluoroscopic spot images of the small bowel were obtained.
A second medium-sized diverticulum is noted of the proximal jejunum.
Evaluation of the terminal ileum demonstrates no focal abnormality.
Initial HCT was 23.
He underwent a tagged RBC scan which was negative for source of bleed.
He was given 1 bag plts on [**3-6**] for plt count 30.
The patient underwent EGD and colonscopy which were negative for source of bleeding.
Given history of endovascular repair concern for aorto-enteric fistula prompted a non-contrast CT which did not show a fistula, however did demonstrate an existing infrarenal AAA and a high density intraluminal material within right colon.
The patient underwent capsule endoscopy to evaluate for bleeding of small bowel and was found to have active bleeding in distal small bowel.
Further evaluation for potential mass/diverticulum in small bowel was negative, including Meckel's scan and small bowel follow through.
His HCT has remained stable, received transfsion on [**3-14**] and [**3-16**] for slowly trending down HCT.
Per GI recommendations, the patient should undergo repeat capsule endoscopy as an outpatient further evaluate small bowel.
He had a plt count of 157 on arrival, followed by a decrease to 30 following multiple transfusions.
He will follow up in hematology clinic for further evaluation on [**2110-3-28**].
His cardiac enzymes trending down appropriately (0.12 to 0.08).
# Diastolic CHF - Pt underwent TTE on [**3-12**] and was found to have significant diastolic dysfunction.
EF >55%, moderate pulm HTN.

Lower GI bleed 2.
Your EGD and colonscopy were negative for bleeding.
Your blood counts have been stable and there is no signs of continued bleeding.
Please continue to monitor your blood sugar and follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for further management of your diabetes.
You should have a capsule endoscopy to evaluate your small bowel for evidence of bleeding.
