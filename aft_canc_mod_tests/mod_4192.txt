Immunohistochemical studies show diffuse staining of the atypical cells with cytokeratin 7.
[**2106-6-29**] ECHO TTE The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2106-6-29**] Cardiac Cath FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
CT Neck [**2106-6-29**] 1.
Recommend dedicated CT chest for further evaluation.
Filling defects in the SVC and brachiocephalic veins, suggestive of focal thrombus versus artifact.
Recommend further evaluation on chest CT. 4.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2106-6-30**]  CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: A focal consolidation within the right upper lobe (700B:32) exhibits multiple air bronchograms, compatible with pneumonia.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A hypodense lesion within the right lobe of the liver (6:58) is most likely a hepatic cyst, however, this remains too small for further characterization.
The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel appear unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon and intrapelvic loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
[**2106-7-1**] Abdominal X-ray: There is no evidence of free air.
[**2106-7-3**] Abdominal X-ray:  The current study demonstrates dilatation of the transverse colon up to 6.5 cm.
If clinically warranted, further evaluation with cross-sectional imaging might be considered.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-7-1**], the findings are similar.
[**2106-7-4**] CT Torso W/ and W/Out Contrast: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo F p/w recurrent pericardial effusion w/ tamponade and RUE swelling, found to have RUL opacity, lymphadenopathy on CT and R subclavian DVT US, now s/p pericardiocentesis w drain (dc'd).
Prior effusion studies at OSH: rheumatoid factor negative, primarily rbcs, few wbcs, and culture negative (including AFP).
AFB smear was negative x 3.
Atrius heme-onc attending following pt - wants to consider holding off on IP biopsy and waiting for path to come back on pericardial fluid since it has malignant cells.
She was guaiac negative and had mild hematemesis (coffee grounds vs. food).
On [**2106-7-4**] her HCT dropped from 30 to 15.
Her vital signs were stable (HR unchanged at 105, BP 140/90 no orthostasis) and she states she felt dizzy.
She was transferred to the MICU for further management, where her BP was managed, as well as given blood.
Multiple episodes hemoptysis during CT neck/chest (obtained CT neck only).
CT chest showed RUL opacity with questionable underlying mass.
Normal albumin, elevated INR (normal PTT).
Has been having BM's, but repeat abdominal XR shows more distended bowels, no free air.
A CT torso showed massive abdominal and pelvic hemoperitoneum from a ruptured left adnexal cyst with a reactive ileus.
Serial hematocrits remained stable.
A pelvic ultrasound confirmed a corpus luteum cyst without other suspicious GYN pathology.
Also on the night of transfer to the MICU, her urine output decreased, but responded to fluids.
Bilateral LENI's showed no evidence of lower extremity DVT.
MRI detailed a punctate area of abnormal enhancement involving the right temporal lobe suspicious for metastasis.
an SVC filter was placed (she already got IVC while in MICU).
# Pericardial Effusion - As for her pericardial effusion, which is likely to reaccumulate: Discussion with cardiothoracic surgery lend us to conclude that given her current status (in terms of prognosis) it is prudent to not do the pericardial window and the plan is to watch her to see if it reaccumulate.
