Her visiting nurse took her temp, which was noted to be 99.9.
A CT scan was obtained of her chest and neck.

Osteopenia  PERTINENT CANCER HISTORY: - A bone scan on [**2156-3-15**] showed multiple areas of increased tracer uptake consistent with metastatic disease in L1, the proximal right femur, bilateral sacroiliac joints, left ischium, and bilateral scapula as well as the occiput.
- CT scanning revealed multiple liver lesions as well as multiple small lung nodules primarily located in the right middle and right lower lobe, as well as a subcarinal lymph node measuring 1.2 cm.
- Ms. [**Known lastname 58746**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a liver biopsy [**2156-3-30**] which revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma poorly differentiated with immunoassay positive for CK7, negative for CK20, negative for Ttf-1 and estrogen receptor, chromogranin, synaptophysin, progesterone receptor, and HER-2/neu.
Her serum tumor markers including a CEA were within normal limits.
- Bilateral breast MRIs have been negative.

Please perform CT angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolus.
COMPARISON: CT chest without contrast [**2156-6-25**].
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were obtained first through the lungs without contrast, followed by a CT angiogram of the chest in the pulmonary arterial phase.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is no evidence for central or segmental pulmonary embolus.
Mediastinal lymph nodes in the precarinal region and aortopulmonary window up to 7 mm wide, are stable, and do not meet the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT REFORMATS: Coronal, sagittal, and oblique sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial findings.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Since exam one day previous ([**2156-6-24**]) the right upper lobe process is slightly more prominent (possibly reflecting technical factors).
IMPRESSION: Short interval slight progression right upper lobe pneumonia which was not present on study [**2156-5-28**].
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VEIN DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler examination of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral and popliteal veins were performed.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
MRI EXAM OF THE LUMBAR SPINE  CLINICAL INDICATION: Metastatic breast cancer, assess for compression or tumor progression.
MRI exam of the lumbar spine was obtained according to standard departmental protocol.
Comparison is made to the prior exam from [**5-27**], [**2156**].
#Respiratory distress: Patient was intubated in the ED for airway protection - no documented stridor or hypoxia.
On HD#3, pt developed the start of improved cuff leak around the ETT tube, and was evaluated by ENT who after a repeat CT neck was unchanged, and laryngoscopy was unremarkable, recommended for extubation.
U/A was negative, CXR negative for possible PNA.
Blood cx's remained NGTD at time of discharge.
She did spike low grade fevers with a maximum of 101, antiobiotics were held, blood and urine cultures were unrevealing.
A chest xray demonstrated a possible early developing pneumonia, but this could not be correlated clinically.
As she continued to spike fevers, a CT scan was ordered revealing ground glass opacities in the Right lung fields, as she continued to spike fevers, she was placed on zosyn and vancomycin for the possibilit of hospital acquired pneumonia, in discussion with ID she was transitioned to flagyl, ceftazadine and vancomycin.
Azithromycin was added for coverage of atypical infections, and an induced sputum was attempted but no sputum could be collected.
In addition, legionella, and viral cultures from a nasal swab were collected but without growth.
She was weaned to room air, and her antiobiotics were slowly tapered, first flagyl was removed were her remaining stable.
Her ceftazadime should be d/c'ed on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1017**] [**7-4**] if she remains afebrile.
A cortisol stimulation test was performed to determine if adrenal insufficiency was a component of her weakness, she responded within normal limits to the cosyntropin stimulus, steroid myopathy was considered as an alternative hypothesis of her proximal muscle weakness.
An MRI of the spine while demonstrating spinal involvement was negative for cord compression.
#Cardiac: Her antihypertensives were held as patient admitted on a sepsis protocol.
She had an episode of sinus tachycardia during her hospital course likely secondary to anxiety, she was monitored on telemetry and her cardiac enzymes were cycled without abnormalities noted.
