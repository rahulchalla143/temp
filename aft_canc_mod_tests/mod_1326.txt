Recent CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis in [**2134-11-23**] demonstrated a 2 mm nodule in the left lower lobe of the lung that was unchanged from previous CT's in both [**2131**] and in [**2132**].
However, the abdominal CT demonstrated ill defined low attenuation mass near the porta He is now referred for caudate lobe resection.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure was 146/76, heart rate 88, temperature afebrile and weight 186 lbs.
His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat demonstrates no scleral icterus.
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  In [**2134-10-23**] sodium 138, potassium 5.2, chloride 99, CO2 25, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, glucose 189, calcium 9.5, AST 30, ALT 41, alkaline phosphatase 71, total bilirubin 0.5 and albumin 4.2.
There, he had a right hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy, wedge biopsy of the left lobe, needle biopsy of the left lobe and intraoperative ultrasound.
GI:  On the evening of his operation, the patient's transaminases were markedly elevated as we expected them to be with an ALT of 2,220 and an AST of [**2041**].
The following day these had decreased to an ALT of 1822 and an AST of 1439, however, because these were not decreasing as quickly as we expected them to, the patient had an ultrasound of his liver.
The study was limited but the hepatic artery, hepatic vein and portal vein were felt to demonstrate adequate blood flow.
Throughout the remainder of the patient's hospitalization, his liver enzymes continued to trend downward.
By the date of the patient's discharge his ALT had decreased to 431 and his AST was 97.
His alkaline phosphatase had consistently remained in the 60-100 range and his total bilirubin was steady at 1.7.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  The patient was started on po on the afternoon of his first postoperative day and by the following day was tolerating Percocet without any problems.
During this time his blood sugars remained in the 180-200 range which we felt were acceptable in the acutely postoperative patient.
On the third postoperative day he had a maximum temperature of 102 degrees.
He was pancultured for this and all studies proved to be negative.
Surgical pathology of his intraoperative specimen revealed that he had a normal gallbladder with two lymph nodes demonstrating no evidence of malignancy.
In addition, he had a liver needle biopsy that demonstrated macro and micro vesicular steatosis with no evidence of malignancy.
His wedge biopsy demonstrated a bile duct adenoma and his resected portion of liver demonstrated adenocarcinoma that was moderately differentiated, consistent with a colorectal primary.
The margins of this were 2 mm from the ink resection margin and there is no vascular invasion seen.
