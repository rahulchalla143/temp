PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs: Temperature 100.0, blood pressure 157/77, heart rate 82, respirations 18, O2 is 95 percent.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 18.7, hematocrit 37.7, platelets 226, sodium 133, potassium 4.6, 93/25 and 29 for BUN, 0.8 for creatinine, 234 for glucose, calcium 8.9, alkaline phosphatase 4.6, magnesium 2.1.
Urinalysis was within normal limits.
ALT was noted to be at 131.
AST was 26.
LDH 243, lipase 224, CK were within normal limits.
Head CT showed air and blood products in the subdural space along the left convexity and surgical resection site and in the left cortex/basal ganglia with surrounding hypo-attenuation into the left caudate nucleus and internal capsule and thalamus.
Chest x-ray showed a retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe likely atelectasis.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial bigeminy at a rate of 78.
Blood cultures on [**2169-9-23**] on both anaerobic and aerobic were positive for GPC pairs and clusters.
Blood cultures from [**2169-9-23**] and [**2169-9-24**] showed coag positive staphylococcus aureus methicillin sensitive.
The blood culture results were indicative of high- grade MSSA bacteremia.
Infectious Disease also recommended an echocardiogram be done to rule out endocarditis.
Regarding the patient's deep venous thrombosis, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] did not want to anticoagulate but follow with serial ultrasounds to see if the clot propagated.
On [**2169-9-25**], the patient had an upper extremity ultrasound to rule out a deep venous thrombosis in his right arm and that was negative for any deep venous thrombosis.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, it was noted that his platelets dropped to as low as 85.
His subcutaneous heparin was discontinued and a heparin panel was sent off.
Also, his sodium at that time started to fall to the 133 range.
The HIT panel was positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
His liver function tests were monitored closely while continuing to receive oxacillin.
The patient expressed extreme need to be discharged home along with his wife.
Also, home visiting nurse service was set up due to the fact that he would need continuous infusion of oxacillin.
On [**2169-9-28**], a repeat ultrasound was performed of the patient's right lower extremity which showed propagation of deep venous thrombosis to the popliteal vein and distal superficial femoral vein.
On [**2169-10-3**], the day of discharge, it was noted that his hematocrit was 26.8.
