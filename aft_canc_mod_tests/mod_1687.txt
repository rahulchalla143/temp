[**4-29**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: Persistent colonic wall thickening along the ascending and transverse portions, probably more so than distally, consistent with an inflammatory or infectious causes of colitis including potentially graft versus host disease.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Color Doppler study suggests possible small interatrial shunt consistent with stretched patent foramen ovale or small atrial septal defect.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There may be trace aortic regurgitation (better seen on study of [**2161-5-7**]).
# Dysuria: BK virus from the urine was positive, and so IVF were given for the patient to encourage urination and to avoid clot formation.
No viral inclusions were seen on bx, and a CMV immunostain was done which was negative.
CT abd/pelvis without contrast (gvien myeloma hx showed findings c/w GVH of the colon diffusely.
Echocardiogram was done that showed no evidence of structural heart disease to explain ECG or telemetry findings and he had no evidence of conduction disease.
He was also found to have orthostatic hypotension, with change in blood pressure from 195/105 when laying flat, with HR 40s, siting 139/103 HR 50-70, and standing 77/51 HR 122.
The autonomics service was consulted and his dysautonomia was thought likely to be chronic with chemotherapy induced autonomic neuropathy with velcade being the most likely cause.
He should follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic for outpatient testing and in future a workup for paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy could be considered, however this is unlikely.
# Hypertension: Metoprolol was discontinued given bradycardia, BP trended up to 200's and hydralazine was stared.
He was transitioned to nifedipine with SBP in 150's, he will need follow up with repeat medication titration on discharge.
# Pneumonia: The patient developed a R sided PNA in the setting of a positive MRSA blood culture during this admission.
Transitional Issues: - He was started on Nifedipine for hypertension and will need BP checks and dose titration - Patient will require two weeks of IV antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin (to complete [**6-16**]) - Patient will need follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in infectious disease before completion of vancomycin.
- Patient will need repeat RUE U/S in one month to make sure that clot has resolved.

For that reason, you had a flexible sigmoidoscopy and a CT scan which showed likely GVHD.
Your hospitalization was complicated by a slow heart rate and variable blood pressure that we think was due to some of the chemotherapy that you received.
