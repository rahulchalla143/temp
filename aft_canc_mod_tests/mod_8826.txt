Labs and imaging significant for Na 120, Cr 3.1.

She does have ankle edema and PND x1 the day PTA.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
She was started on milrinone continuous infusion; CO increased to 3.1 from 2.9, f/u ECHO did not show significant change but her symptoms improved.
# Hyponatremia: Urine osmoles showed inappropriately concentrated urine in the face of hyponatremia and volume overload.
This was supported by low urine Na, suggesting the kidneys were seeing poor forward flow and trying to augment volume and Na.
She was sent for a right heart cath which showed improvement in cardiac output with milrinone.
Her echo on this showed "Borderline dilated, globally hypokinetic left ventricle.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-5-27**], at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now present; it was previously indeterminate.
As above, her cardiac output improved to 3.1.
With addition of milrinone, her Cr improved from 3.1 on [**Last Name (un) **] to 2.0  # atrial fibrillation (Afib): Chronic afib status post ICD and now constantly v-paced.
Information was obtained from PatientFamily/Caregiver.
We think that both of these problems were because your heart failure was worsening and the blood was not circulating well to the kidneys.
You underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed that your heart pump was weak and improved with a new medication, called milrinone.
An ultrasound of your heart showed that it beat more effectively with milrinone.
