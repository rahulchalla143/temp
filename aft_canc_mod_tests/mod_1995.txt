[**2164-5-22**] 2:30 am URINE                              **FINAL REPORT [**2164-5-26**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2164-5-26**]):       PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          Piperacillin/Tazobactam sensitivity testing performed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**]          [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].
CT OF THE HEAD: [**2164-5-23**] A right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter (VP shunt) ends in the third ventricle, unchanged from prior studies.
Compared to the MRI from [**2164-4-30**] and the CT from [**2164-4-20**], the bilateral extra-axial subdural fluid collections have increased and the ventricular size has decreased, suggesting mild overshunting.
Hypodense vasogenic edema at the left peritrigonal and temporoparietal region is unchanged from prior studies based on the previous MRI likely due to radiation necrosis.
Otherwise, no change from the most recent prior studies in [**2164-4-17**].
CXR [**5-22**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Heterogeneous right testicle with evidence of vascular compromise, suggesting ischemia, which may be due to swelling.
# Epididymitis, orchitis, hydrocele: [**5-25**], at 0445 pt was being cleaned and nurses noted TTP in scrotal area despite pt denying pain in area.
Scrotal US showed e/o florid epidiymitis that is vascular; hydrocele with minimal septations suggestive of possible pyocele; testis with decreased vascularity with no flow in diastole suggestive of decreased venous outflow; heterogenous testis likely [**1-19**] ischemia.
Patient had a previous urine culture with pseudomonas sensitive to quinolones, but had been treated with nitrofurantoin to which it was resistant; he was covered during his MICU stay with cipro for sensitive pseudomonas; his U-Cx also grew out Enterococcus which was cipro resistant; doxycycline was added on [**5-27**].
DDx included long-term effects of L temporal radiation necrosis, or possible "overshunting" observed on head CT compared with CT from [**2-27**].
The CT head "overshunting" finding was not likely significant at this time, per neurosurgery evaluation.
# PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 11091**]: thought to be cause of pt's hypoxia, CXR findings, and elevated beta-glucan during previous admission.
-- Check electrolytes in [**1-20**] days to trend hyponatremia   Medications on Admission: Medications (per [**4-30**] discharge summary):  1. levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Capsule(s) 12. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection TID (3 times a day): Pt may refuse if ambulating tid.
