[**2117-6-25**] CT ABd/Pelvis: 1.
In the absence of known primary malignancy, followup CT scan is recommended in 12 months.
His hospital course during this admission is as follows:  1 Adrenal Hemorrhage: unclear why he would have spontaneous adreanl hemorrage; (no known adrenal mass from CT 1 yr ago); He was intubated intially, and taken to IR  s/p IR embolization of right middle adrenal artery for right adrenal gland enlargement and hemorrhage with active extravasation of contrast on presentation into the surrounding retroperitoneum -> successfully extubated on [**2118-4-27**]-> trasnferred to medicine service on [**2118-4-28**]; CT with evidence of R adrenal enlargement w/ surrounding hematoma, difficult to assess whether underlying mass is present and/or whether adrenal enlargement can be completely attributed to bleed (reviewing of the CT scan films again with staff radiologist once on the medicine floor, no adrenal mass seen on CT scan 1 year ago ([**2116**]), and currently adrenal enlargement can be attributed to acute bleeding, recommended follow CT or MRI after resolution of this bleeding 1 month).
On one end, patient with history of poorly controlled HTN x 25 years, however, he is a smoker, obese, poor diet and medication compliance which all can be contributed to his hypertension.
We added on a  plasma metanephrines and am cortisol level which remained pending at the time of discharge and will be followed up with pt's PCP 1 wk after discharge.
He was also recommended to have his PCP schedule an MRI or CT w/ or w/o contrast of his abdomen/pelvis 1 month after discharge to make sure of the resolution of his hematoma and to reassess if there is any adrenal mass that may have caused this bleeding.
2 Anemia -Patient Hct 39.7 on admission, but has a significant Hct drop given his known adreanl and consequent RP hemoorhage, he received 2 untis of pRBCs, and his Hct remained stable and trending up at the time of discharge.
3 HTN - most likely essential HTN (given smoking, obese, poor diet and med compliance, only on 2 agents (CCB and bb) at home); secondary hypertension is less likely, however, given his acute adrenal bleed,  we checked a plasma metanephrin and cortisol level which remained pending at the time of discharge.
His BP remained well controlled on betablocker only, but titrated up to 100mg twice a day at the time of the discharge.
He was to have a repeat MRI or CT of abdomen/pelvis 1 months after dishcarge tomake sure resolution of hematoma and assess if any adrenal mass; If clinically indicated for 2ndary causes of his hypertension, he can have outpt work up for pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, or cushion symdrome (although our suspicion for these 2ndary causes of his hypertension is very low).
You need to follow up with your PCP next week (see appointment below);  please have your PCP schedule and MRI (preferable) or CT (w/ and w/o contrast) of your abdomen/pelvis to make sure the hematoma resolves in 1 month, and to assess if there is any adrenal mass that may have caused this bleeding.
