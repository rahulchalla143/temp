A chest xray showed a right sided infiltrate with concern for a fungal process.
By noon his temperature was 102.5.
He called his oncologist and was sent to the ED for further evaluation and workup of his fevers.
His blood pressures were in the low 90's during most of his stay in the ED.
His respiratory rate increased to the 30's, but improved after treatment with a nebulizer.
His heart rate improved to the 110's after fluids.
Vital signs on transfer were: 102.8 98/43 112 22 99 on 4L.
(3) Subsequently, he saw Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Company 2860**], and flow cytometry of peripheral blood on [**2145-4-28**] confirmed a lymphocyte predominance by CLL; 3% of cells were positive for CD38.
On [**2145-4-28**], torso CT scan at [**Hospital1 112**] showed extensive lymphadenopathy at multiple sites throughout the upper neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, as summarized in my [**2146-2-25**] note.
(4) Repeat CBCs in [**5-11**] again showed leukocytosis with lymphocyte predominance on differential.
At [**Hospital1 18**], WBCs = 13.6 and 17.9K with 76% and 66% lymphocytes on [**2145-5-26**] and [**2145-5-31**], respectively.
On evaluation by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Company 2860**], concern was raised regarding transformation of his CLL, and repeat torso CT scan was obtained on [**2145-6-3**], showing interval increase in some but not all areas of lymphadenopathy, as summarized in my [**2146-2-25**] note.
Chest exam was clear.
WBC was now 60K, representing a tripling in WBC over 4 months.
However, evaluation of pericardial tissue showed organizing fibrinous material with entrapped mixed inflammatory cells, including numerous small lymphocytes consistent with CLL cells.
Of note, multiple specimens for various infectious diseases (see OMR) were negative except for [**Location (un) **] B4 and B5 antibodies which were "8" rather than "less than 8."
Pleural biopsy showed: "Extensive granulation tissue along with mesothelial proliferation and hemosiderin-laden macrophages are seen, consistent with the chronicity of the effusive process is present.
The morphology, supported by the concurrent flow cytometry immunophenotyping ([**-6/2615**]: CD20 dim, CD5-positive, CD23-positive, lambda light chain expression) is consistent with a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma."
On [**2146-10-24**], when peripheral blood lymphocytes declined below 50K, he received his first dose of Rituxin, given over 2 days.
On [**2147-10-27**], after five Campath doses, Campath was held secondary to WBC 0.4 with ANC 297 and increased anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Blood cultures, urine culture, CMV viral load, adenovirus PCR, EBV PCR, Parvo 19 DNA negative and HHV-8 PCR and respiratory viral screen and cultures were all negative.
On [**2149-3-3**], repeat chest CT showed marked improvement with near complete resolution of ground glass lung opacities, prompting infectious disease specialist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] to discontinue voriconazole therapy for aspergillosis.
