PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of 98.9 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse was 104, blood pressure was 127/87, respiratory rate was 20, and breathing 98 percent on room air.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Rectal examination was heme-negative.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus, the plan at this time was to admit this 62-year-old patient with a likely case of typhlitis, status post Whipple procedure, to give the patient pain control, to place the patient nothing by mouth, and to perform serial examinations at this point.
The plan at this time was to obtain a computerized axial tomography scan and reevaluate the patient.
The computerized axial tomography scan ended up showing no perforation, contrast going all the way through the small and large intestines, with no air in the bowel wall, some stranding in the right lower quadrant, and a small amount of fluid.
