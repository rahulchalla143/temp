CPR was initiated and recheck of the rhythm revealed bradycardia and hypotension.
On arrival to the ED here, SBP's were in the 60's and pulses were thready.

CXR also demonstrated a low ETT, which was pulled back appropriately.
CTA negative for PE.
CT torso significant for LUL consolidation only.
CT spine clear.

CT Torso ([**2167-1-21**]) 1.
Extremely limited examination due to habitus and patient positioning.
Followup imaging/ultrasound recommended when the patient is more stable.
This can be further evaluated with dedicated adrenal CT scan with washout study 8.
Left kidney indeterminate lesion, 2.2 cm, which can also be evaluated at time of adrenal CT. .
TTE ([**2167-1-22**]) The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%).
Chest ([**2167-2-6**]) Comparison with [**2-5**] at 14:12 hours.
Clinical correlation regarding the widened mediastinum is recommended, and a CT could be performed if clinically indicated.
An oral airway was placed and she was ventilated.
There was no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.
There was no evidence of pulmonary embolus by CT angiography.
Blood glucose was 211 in field.
Her rate averaged in the 130s during these episodes.
She was transitioned back to subcutaneous insulin prior to discharge, with instructions to follow her blood glucose closely, and titrate her insulin regimen as needed.
