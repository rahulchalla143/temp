She went to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] and CXR revealed large mass in her R lung as well as a possible post-obstructive PNA.
CTA at [**Location (un) 620**] with large R mediastinal mass, invading into R lung, wraps around R PA, and compresses R mainstem bronchus down to diameter of 3 cm at points.
BP initially 90's w/one [**Location (un) 1131**] in 70's.
Pt given 2.5 liters IVF and BP stablized in 110s.
Baseline BP 120's.
Although her vitals signs were stable in the ED, she was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring given the potential risk for airway compromise as well as erosion of mass into her pulmonary artery.

Immunophenotyping: Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by leukemia or lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
