His repeat biopsies here at [**Hospital1 1444**] revealed in fact high-grade muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma, and the patient was then entered into a bladder-sparing protocol where he received gemcitabine, Taxol, and carboplatin chemotherapy.
Following his second course, his simple cystoscopy revealed a questionable lesion on the right wall of the bladder at the bladder neck, and magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed progression of disease.
The patient was then biopsied, and the repeat biopsy sent did reveal ongoing high-grade muscle invasive bladder carcinoma.
Following his procedure, he was nothing by mouth with a nasogastric tube in place.
Throughout the beginning of his course, his urine output gradually became more increased through his Foley and suprapubic tube and less through the stents.
