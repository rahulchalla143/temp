MR head done (see report in chart and briefly in results below, no major findings).
Transfused 1 unit PRBCs [**8-8**] with Hct bump from 26.9 to 30.1.
A noncontrast abd CT scan was done.
It was a poor study and showed contrast remaining in stomach and duodenum c/w SBO.
EGD could not be passed beyond D3 due to a possible extrinsic mass, even with pedi scope.
At that point, reportedly, review of her CT suggested possible uncinate mass (per our GI team discussion with OSH GI team - I do not see this documented in OSH records however).
She is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation by our advanced endoscopy team and consideration for EUS with biopsy if appropriate.
Pertinent Results: [**2150-9-6**]: CBC WBC-8.3 Hgb-8.9 Hct-27.1 Plt Ct-209  [**2150-9-7**] Chem: Glucose-39 UreaN-33 Creat-1.9 Na-140 K-3.9 Cl-109 HCO3-21 AnGap-14  [**2150-9-4**] LFTs: ALT-33 AST-48 AlkPhos-1019 TotBili-1.6  MRI Abdomen [**2150-8-16**]: Inadequately characterized 2 x 4 cm ill-defined mass involving the junction of second and third part of duodenum with mass effect on the pancreatic head and compression of the duodenal lumen resulting in mild upstream gastric distention.
CT HEAD [**2150-8-28**]: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Patient underwent biopsy of metastatic nodules and gastrojejunostomy on [**2150-8-28**] without complications.
CT head was negative for intracranial pathology and patient slowly regained neurological function spontaneously.
Lasix was held several times due to increase in Cr (Max 2.4) but was resumed when ARF resolved.
Echo was done on [**8-25**] and demonstarted mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF= 45 %) consistent with coronary artery disease.
Renal: Patient's CRF was complicated with several instances of increased Cr with max 2.4.
Cr on discharge was stable at 1.9-2.
CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
