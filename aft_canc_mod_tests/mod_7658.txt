Biopsy revealed melanoma with tumor cells staining positive for S100, Melan-A, HMB45 anti-tyrosinase.
Torso CT revealed left hilar adenopathy, two indeterminate densities at the right hemithorax and numerous hepatic lesions highly suggestive of metastatic disease.
She completed 2 cycles of Temodar in [**Month (only) 116**] with torso CT showing interval progression in the perirectal adenopathy and liver lesions.
Her nuclear stress test revealed no EKG changes but there was a perfusion defect.
It was unclear if this was artifact so she underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2160-6-30**] revealing a 30% to 40% stenosis of the LAD felt to be hemodynamically insignificant.
She passed eligibility testing and is now admitted to begin cycle 1 week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy.
VITAL SIGNS:  98.1, 85, 18, 96/66, O2 sat 95% on room air.
ADMISSION LABS:  WBC 10.1, hemoglobin 13.4, hematocrit 40.1, platelet count 335,000, INR 1.1.
BUN 12, creatinine 0.6, sodium 138, potassium 3.7, chloride 100, CO2 27, glucose 119, ALT 33, AST 29, CK 37, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 4.5, calcium 9.4, phosphorus 3.0, magnesium 2.0.
Her admission weight was 66.9 kg and she received interleukin-2 600,000 international units per kilo equalling 40.3 million units IV q.
Hypotension was initially noted on treatment day 4 with initial response to a fluid bolus.
On treatment day 6 she was tachypneic with hypoxia and chest x- ray confirmed acute pulmonary edema.
In the ICU she was treated with BiPAP and serial cardiac enzymes were done to rule out cardiac source which were negative.
Echo revealed a normal LVEF.
Other side effects from IL-2 this week included nausea and vomiting improved with antiemetic therapy; diarrhea; fatigue and development of an erythematous pruritic skin rash.
During this week she developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 1.3 improved to 0.4 at the time of discharge.
She had associated oliguria and mild metabolic acidosis noted with a minimum bicarb of 18.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted per protocol.
She developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 234 and a peak AST of 151, both improved within normal limits at the time of discharge.
She developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 2.6 improved to normal at the time of discharge.
She developed mild thrombocytopenia with platelet count low of 132,000 without evidence of bleeding.
