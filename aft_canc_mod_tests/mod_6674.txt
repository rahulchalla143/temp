EGD visualized a nonbleeding visible vessel which was appropriately clipped.
Her vitals remained stable with a blood pressure in the 140s-150s/70-80 range.
Pulse was regular in the 80s.
She had no response to light stimuli or to verbal response.
Her exam was variable with neurological testing.
She underwent a CT of the head which showed just atrophy.
She had a "pill rolling tremor" on the left and her toes were up.
On neurologic exam at that time her pupils were in the midline position.
MRI capability was not possible and so the patient was felt to need a tertiary care center for further work-up of stroke.

Head CT shows diffuse changes of small vessel disease, but no loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is noted, nor is there evidence of hemorrhage.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates small vertebral artery secondary to persistent trigeminal artery, but no evidence of occlusion in the carotid or vertebral arteries.
Chest CT can help for further assessment.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates persistent right-sided trigeminal artery, but no vascular occlusion is seen.
Repeat imaging showed a likely stroke in the left precentral area.
EEG was suggestive of a large area of ischemia.
