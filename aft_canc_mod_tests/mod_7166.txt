The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2133-1-15**], the left ventricular systolic function is now borderline hyperdynamic.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2140-2-10**] 5:00 PM FINDINGS: There are low lung volumes when compared with prior and increasing bibasilar opacities.
CXR [**2-12**]- FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change as to the massive bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities, right more than left.
EKG-[**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname 1955**] H [**Medical Record Number 107892**] M  85  [**2054-4-24**]  Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2140-2-10**]  5:07:14 PM Sinus rhythm with first degree atrio-ventricular conduction delay.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-1-1**] heart rate is slower.
Microbiology:  DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2140-2-11**]): Negative for Influenza A.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2140-2-11**]): Negative for Influenza B.
Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary): GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).
Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2140-2-11**]): GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
Video swallow ([**2140-2-15**]): VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: The study was conducted in collaboration with speech pathology.
Initial CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
Speech and swallow ordered, and video swallow showed severe silent aspiration on all liquids, including honey-thickened.
He then was made NPO and arranged for a PEG tube, which he got on [**2140-2-19**].
Upon discharge, his pulmonary status was stable, with slowly decreasing WBC and O2 requirement of 3L.
1 bottle of blood cultures from [**2140-2-10**] was positive for GPCs in clusters - felt to be contaminant.
Leukocytosis was trending slowly down on discharge.
On Coumadin at rehab, however, supratherapeutic INR of 3.5 on admission.
Coumadin was held and INR monitored - goal INR = 2.0 - 3.0.
He was restarted on low-dose coumadin on [**2140-2-20**], and this may be titrated for goal INR [**1-7**].
His Creatinine was mostly stable for several days prior to discharge.
Megace Oral 400 mg/10 mL (40 mg/mL) PO twice a day.
Tablet(s) 11. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day): please give NG if NPO.
You had a speech and swallow test which showed severe aspiration on all types of liquids, including honey-thickened.
You will continue to get your nutrition through your feeding tube, and you should have a repeat speech and swallow evaluation once your pneumonia is resolved.
Medication changes: 1.stopped megace 2.medications for constipation if needed 3.decreased warfarin to 1 mg daily, this may need to be increased for goal INR [**1-7**] .
