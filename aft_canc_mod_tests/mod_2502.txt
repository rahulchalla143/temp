At that time, her white blood cell count was 19.
Her oxygen saturation was found to be 72% on 2 L which decreased to 63% on 4 L.  The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**].
The patient had a blood pressure of 176/44, pulse 110, and oxygen saturation of 70% on nonrebreather and was intubated for respiratory distress with subsequent hypotension after induction.
The patient had a chest x-ray after intubation which showed prominent right hilar area concerning for vascular abnormality.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed in the Emergency Room which revealed no evidence of dissection, normal right ventricular size and function, no acute changes consistent with PE, and normal ejection fraction greater than 55%.
Initial CVP was [**5-18**] after 1 L normal saline.
Biopsies were taken from the superior segment of the right lower lobe mucosa, as well as BAL brushings were obtained.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  At the time of admission to Intensive Care Unit temperature was 98.4?????
?, blood pressure 117/42, pulse 79, respirations 10, SIMV 500, 12, 5, 100%.
LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission, white blood cell count 35.3, hematocrit 41.5, MCV 86, RDW 14, differential with neutrophils of 96%, bands 3%, atypicals 1%, platelet count 395; PT 13.5, PTT 25.4, INR 1.2; urinalysis yellow, cloudy, specific gravity of 1.025, large blood, negative nitrite, 30 protein, no glucose or ketones, small leukocyte esterase, greater than 50 red blood cells, greater than 50 white blood cells, few bacteria, few yeast, 21-50 squamous epithelial cells; glucose 236; sodium 129, potassium 4.3, chloride 97, bicarb 20, BUN 43, creatinine 2.1; CK 139, CKMB 6, troponin less than 0.3; albumin 3.5, calcium 6.9, phosphorus 8.1, magnesium 2.4; Dilantin 2.1; initial arterial blood gas while intubated with a pH of 7.27, pCO2 49, pO2 221 on 100% FI02; lactate 2.1, free calcium 1.04.
The patient's chest x-ray showed question of wide mediastinum but no evidence of PE or dissection by transesophageal echocardiogram.
Other issues included hyponatremia, acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.1 which has since resolved.
The patient was initially treated with steroids for presumed adrenal insufficiency; however, cortisol stimulation test was fine, and steroids were discontinued.
The patient had bronchoscopy with brushings and biopsy on [**2-18**] and was extubated on [**2-19**].
Lung cancer:  The patient had right lower lobe biopsy which did not show any definite malignancy.
The patient had bronchial brushings which showed rare atypical cells and reactive bronchial cells and acute inflammation.
She also had bronchial washings which were positive for malignant cells consistent with non-small cell carcinoma with features suggestive of squamous differentiation.
The patient was with a chest CT revealing a 6.2 x 5.4 cm low attenuation lesion in the superior segment of the right lower lobe of the lung.
The patient also had head CT which did not reveal any evidence of metastatic lesions; however, study was suboptimal to detect these lesions, as it was done for other purposes.
The goal INR will be between 2 and 3, and the patient is currently on a dose of Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o.
Question stroke:  The patient had supratherapeutic PTT and hematocrit drop, as well as questionable left-sided weakness and had head CT on [**2-22**] which was negative for evidence of acute bleed.
regimen and had good control of her blood pressure between 130s and 160s systolic on a regimen of Clonodine 2 patches q.week, Lisinopril 40 mg p.o.
FEN:  The patient has a speech and swallow evaluation which showed that she would be able to take purees and thin liquids.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will need her INR followed with a goal INR between 2 and 3.
The patient is currently with an INR greater than 3 on a dose of Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o.
