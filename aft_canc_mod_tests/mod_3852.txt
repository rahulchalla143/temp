In ED, noted SBP 95, with HR 140's.
Received 2 L IVF--->hypoxic with CXR findings of vol overload.
HCT on arrival was 23 and INR 10 (last INR last week was 2.0) .
Total decortication of right lung on [**2191-10-17**] for recurrent Right pleura effusion.
He was discharged from this operation on [**2191-10-26**], and readmitted on [**10-28**] with an empyema--->anterior loculated hydropneumothorax, which eventually was positive for MRSA.
All biopsy and cytology neg.
Daughet is HCP (lives with him)   Family History: non-contrib  Physical Exam: T:96.9 P:AF with RVR 99-141 on tele R:18-30 BP:119/90 SaO2:99% on NRB General: Awake, alert, oriented x3; speaking [**2-4**] words/breath.
1+ DP and PT pulses b/l.
Pertinent Results: ECHO [**2192-12-1**]: Conclusions: 1.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2191-11-1**], LV function has improved.
CXR [**2192-1-6**]: HISTORY: Aspiration pneumonia status post extubation.
AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The patient has been extubated in the interval.
* Hypotension: Initially, hypotension, HR and urine output responsive to fluids however became less so as MICU course progressed.
Echo on [**12-15**] showed a new decreased EF to 35% (>60% on [**2191-12-2**]) with new wall motion abnormalities suggesting NSTEMI.
Over the next few days, heart rate came down with improved pressure on levophed allowing the initiation of a lasix drip.
When pt was reintubated on [**12-26**], his BP dropped again suggesting that his hypotension is related to positive pressure and sedation.
Swan on [**12-14**] showed elevated CVP and wedge indicating volume overload.
As BP improved, Levpophed was titrated off and pt was restarted on his ACE-I and BB for further afterload reduction.
On [**12-26**], pt had another episode of pulm edema that was not responsive to nitro patch, morphine and lasix x 2. he was placed on BiPAP but was tachypneic to 40-50s with minute ventilation of 22-23.
troponin trended down and repeat echo showed normalization of EF.
When he was reintubated, a dobutamine stress echo was done at the bedside and showed no signs of ischemia.
INR reversed with FFP and vitamin K, now normalized.
Hct stable s/p 5U PRBCs total.
EGD on [**12-22**] showed no signs of gastritis or ulcers.
hct slowly trended down during ICU stay possible due to slow lower GI bleed (hemorrhoids?).
* UTI: When UA checked for sediment, noted to have 21-50 WBC with mod bacteria.
Sent for cx which returned VRE, [**Last Name (un) 36**] to ampicillin.
* Decreased urine output: Urine lytes show Na of 10 indicating pre-renal likely [**1-5**] poor forward flow.
Creatinine slowly increased over hosp stay likely [**1-5**] ATN (in setting of hypotension) and poor forward flow.
Urine output improved with lasix gtt and Levophed for better BP.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet po QD 5.
