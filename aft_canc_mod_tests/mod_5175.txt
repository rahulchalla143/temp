s/p IVC filter placement s/p L3 biopsy s/p Liver biopsy .
CXR also suggested bilateral lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
She was also found to have elevated LFTs, with ALT 48, AST 57, Alk phos 548, GGT 248, tbili 0.8.
EKG: Q-waves, ST depressions and TWI in III.
Micro: urine cx [**1-7**] with burkholderia cepacia .
Pan-spine MRI: CERVICAL SPINE: IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on MRI of the cervical spine.
Further evaluation with abdominal and pelvic CT recommended.
CT Torso: IMPRESSION: 1.
Massive aggressive tumor involving the entire left and mid scarum, right iliac bone, L3 and symphysis pubis which most likely represent metastatic spread.
For precise evaluation of spinal involvement please review the MRI from [**2175-1-8**] 3.
Partially visualized heterogeneous masses in the liver representing metastasis as seen on the prior CT scan.
For complete assessment of the abdomen and pelvis, please refer to the official report of CT study performed a day earlier.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
MRV [**1-9**]: 1.
MRI brain: 1.
[**2175-1-20**] Repeat CT scan, Abd/Pelvis w/contrast: 1.
No interval change in appearance of innumerable soft tissue and bony metastatic lesions from prior exam dated [**2175-1-8**].
A/P:  26 y/o F, from [**Country 3587**], with h/o ovarian cyst/mass 6 years ago presenting with hip and back pain, decreased ability to ambulate and urinary incontince, found to have widely metastatic disease of unclear primary and bilateral PEs with residual IVC thrombus, s/p IVC filter placement [**1-10**].
Abdominal cuts demonstrated multiple large heterogeneous masses involving the entire left hepatic lobe up to 6.5 cm in the most distal portion of the lobe and 6 x 7 cm in the more medial and lower portions with marked enlargement of the entire left lobe, depressing the transverse colon and stomach downward and backward.
Pelvis cuts demonstrated a L 7cm x 6.5cm ovarian lesion consistent with a dermoid cyst.
The morning of admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 13983**] became tachycardic, with ECG showing evidence of right heart strain.
A stat chest CTA was obtained, which demonstrated massive bilateral central pulmonary embolism.
She was started on heparin drip, and a stat TTE was obtained, which demonstrated intact RV systolic function, with moderately elevated PA pressures, and no evidence of clot-in-transit.
LENIs showed no evidence of clot.
# MICU Course: In the MICU, she had an MRI of head which ruled out brain mets and she was begun on a heparin gtt.
She had an MRV which demonstrated residual clot in the IVC as well as the left iliac vein.
Her neuro exam remained stable throughout her MICU course.
The patient then had an IR-guided biopsy of a lesion lesion.
The pathology from the liver core showed poorly differentiated cells.
It was impossible to make a diagnosis based on the tissue morphology along and special staining was sent to help determine what type of primary.
A breast exam was performed and the patient was found to have fibrocystic breasts but no fixed masses or lumps, and no discharge from either breast.
There was concern for cord compression but the patient's neuro exam was carefully monitored and remained stable (patient continued to have urinary incontinence and unchanged slight lower extremity weakness ([**5-20**] LLE but normal strength 4/5 RLE)).
The patient was seen by radiation oncology and was simulated for XRT but not treated as her neuro exam remained stable.
Upon discharge, pathology results were still pending.
The patient will be followed up by her primary care doctor and an outpatient oncology appointment will be scheduled for her by the oncology consult service pending results of her pathology to initiate treatment.
The patient had a repeat CT scan during her hospital course to reevaluate her IVC filter and her IVC clot.
She will be followed up by her PCP for an INR check on the day after discharge.
Her LFTs showed a mildly elevated AST (45), elevated GGT, and elevated AP (400) c/w metastatic bone and liver dx.
Her platlet count trended down to 700s-800s.
# ?UTI: Patient was found to have a mildly positive UA, and urine cx with Burkholderia cepacia.
Her hematocrit remained stable.
Enoxaparin 40 mg/0.4 mL Syringe Sig: 40 mg  Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours): Please continue Lovenox until your INR is between 2.0-3.0.
You will need to see your primary care doctor for INR checks (see appointments).
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): Please get your INR checked on [**1-25**] at your primary care doctor's office.
You will see your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 20212**], [**1-25**], for an INR check.
You will need to have your INR checked during that visit on [**Hospital1 20212**].
