She was transferred to the ICU for frequent neurologic checks and blood pressure and heart rate monitoring.
The patient was found to be neurologically stable without increasing subdural hematoma based on MRI on [**2144-9-26**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO OMED SERVICE:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.0, pulse 92, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 120/60, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 2.8, hematocrit 26.5, platelets 106,000, AST 102, ALT 45, LDH 50,270, alkaline phosphatase 270, total bilirubin 2.7, albumin 3.7, haptoglobin 508, fibrinogen 819.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Oncology Service to monitor her pancytopenia and neurologic examination for her subdural hematoma.
The hematocrit ranged between 18 and 26.
The bilirubin levels were not elevated.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed on the patient to determine if cancer had invaded the bone marrow causing the pancytopenia.
Biopsies showed extensive breast tissue within the marrow confirming infiltration.
After bone marrow biopsy showed extensive infiltration of the breast cancer, the patient was treated with Navelbine and Faslodex.
CT examinations showed no increase in interval changes.
The patient was taken off NSAIDs and platelets were kept above 100,000.
Ophthalmology was consulted and examination was performed which showed bilateral papilledema and small hemorrhage in the left optic disk.
MRI with gadolinium scan was performed to evaluate for possible increasing subdural hematoma versus emergence of a new intracranial metastasis.
The results of the MRI were unchanged from previous showing no parenchymal metastasis but involvement of the bone of the skull.
A CT scan of the torso and sinuses were performed which did not show abscesses or signs of infection.
Abdominal CT did show increased size of the liver and spleen with increasing size of metastasis.
To the time of this dictation, cultures have been negative or show contamination.
AST 127, ALT 55, LDH 3,000.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed which showed no evidence of ductal dilatation.
CT scan of the torso also did not show evidence of ductal dilatation.
However, GTT levels were elevated.
