Further evaluation with MRI may provide additional information.
Further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
Cells are positive for CD30 with co-expression of CD45, CD20, CD79, PAX5, [**Male First Name (un) **]-1 and [**Month (only) **]-2 but are negative for CD5, CD15, and ALK-1.
Liver biopsy results indicate a lymphoma with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (grey zone lymphoma).
3) The subsequent biopsy of the patient's bone marrow (S12-31075H) revealed patchy infiltration by a lymphoma containing classic [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells and an appropriate immunoreactive background.

Less likely on the differential included autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and lower biliary process.
Hepatitis B/C serologies and PCR revealed him to be HCV negative.
Blood smear was unremarkable for parasites.
EBV serologies revealed past infection.
CT abdomen revealed innumerable hepatic and splenic small hypodensities, concerning for lymphoma versus metastases, w/ infection also possible.
MRI abdomen revealed an enlarged edematous liver with hepatomegaly and gallbladder wall edema, multiple focal hepatic lesions and innumerable focal lesions in the spleen.
An US-guided biopsy of the liver was performed, with preliminary results concerning for lymphoma vs. hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
LDH was elevated to the 500s-600s during throughout his MICU stay.
Blood, fungal, and urine cultures were unremarkable.
ID and Heme/Onc were consulted, and they recommended that empiric antibiotic therapy be discontinued given that liver biopsy was consistent with malignant process.
IR-guided percutaneous biopsy revealed grey zone lymphoma of the liver.

TSH was within normal limits.
Both percutaneous biopsy of the liver and BM biopsies were obtained, which revealed lymphoma with characteristics intermediate between large B cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
He also had a staging PET scan on [**2173-7-19**] of which the [**Location (un) 1131**] is pending.
A MRI of the head with and without contrast did not reveal any intracranial lymphoma.
His labs revealed transaminitis and elevated bilirubin.
Follow-up CT scan of the abdomen revealed lesions on the liver and spleen along with retroperitoneal LAD, which were concerning for either malignancy (lymphoma vs. mets) vs. infectious.
Once on the floor, he was sent for a biopsy of the livery lesion, the initial read of which revealed lymphocytic infiltration concerning for lymphoma vs. lymphophagocytic histiocytosis.
CEA 2.8 WNL.
After liver and BM biopsy confirmed lymphoma, he was stopped on all antibiotics, and started on allopurinol for ppx against elevated uric acid, and 40mg IV dexamethasone QD with [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs.
His K trended upward to 5.6 and 7.3 s/p initiating steroids, with normal EKG.
This was likely secondary to malignancy as other etiologies on differential including autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and lower biliary process were ruled out.
Hepatitis labs were negative for HAV, HBV, and HCV.
Duplex ultrasound showed no evidence of upper extremity DVT.
LFT's should continue to be monitored as an outpatient.
#Hyperglycemia: Blood glucose has been mildly elevated since starting steroids.

The chemotherapy you received was reduced dosage since your liver function was still decreased.
We also found that your pupils were unequal in size and so we preformed a MRI scan of your head which was normal.
You also had a PET scan to determine the extent of the lymphoma.
An ultrasound showed that you did not have any blood clot in or around the IV  catheter.
