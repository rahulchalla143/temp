[**2151-5-24**] AP CHEST: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-23**] and [**5-24**] at 4:37 a.m.:  Small region of heterogeneous opacification at the right lung base has been present for several days.
Pulse oximetry was monitored closely and the patient maintained adequate oxygenation on [**1-29**] liters of nasal cannula supplementation, requiring home oxygen on discharge to rehab.
Serial abdominal exams were performed, and once flatus resumed, the patient was transitioned to a clear liquid diet and their IV fluids were hep-locked on POD#7.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]/[**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain remained in place post-operatively, anf the output was greater than 30 cc in a 24-hour period, thus she was discharged with the drain in place.
The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain had an amylase level of 18 on POD#8, after the patient tolerated full liquids, and she was transitioned to diet without issue.
GENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was closely monitored in the immediate post-operative period.
The patient's intake and output was closely monitored for urine output > 30 mL per hour output.
The patient's creatinine was stable.
A mild transaminitis was noted following her procedure, which was attributed to clamping of the bile duct during the procedure.
HEME: The patient's post-op hematocrit was stable and trended closely.
Their white count was stable post-operatively and their incision was closely monitored for any evidence of infection or erythema.
Blood glucose levels greater than 120 mg/dL were addressed with an insulin sliding scale.
Incision Care:  * Please call your surgeon or go to the emergency department if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
