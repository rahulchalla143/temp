A recent follow-up chest CT demonstrated a 3 cm hypervascular mass at the junction of the left and right lobes of the liver and possibly a 2nd subcapsular-hypervascular mass in the right lobe.
He underwent a liver biopsy on [**2139-10-7**] that demonstrated poorly differentiated malignancy consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
A preoperative evaluation was done and the patient was found to be suitable for surgical resection.
EBL was 500 cc.
Urine output was 200 cc of urine.
Heart rate was 110-120 and in sinus tachycardia.
Urine output was less than 30 cc an hour.
He had a temperature of 102.1.
He was pancultured for temperature of 102.
Blood and urine cultures were subsequently negative on [**2140-12-21**].
A chest x- ray was done that demonstrated central venous catheter in satisfactory position with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Vital signs were afebrile, heart rate in the 100s and in Afib rhythm.
BP ranged between 150/60-120/65 with CVP of 12, O2 saturation of 99%.
His LFTs postoperatively were AST 75, ALT 137, alkaline phosphatase 95, total bilirubin 1.7.
Ammonia level was 52.
Speech and swallow evaluation was ordered.
His heart rate was in the 90s-100s, irregular.
He underwent a duplex ultrasound on [**12-27**] to assess the portal vein and to assess for bile duct dilatation.
A head CT was done as well.
His respiratory rate was up to 30 breaths per minute, O2 saturation was 99 on 3 liters.
His labs were AST of 57, ALT 119, alkaline phosphatase 96, T bilirubin 0.7.
Creatinine was 0.7 with a BUN of 24.
An occupational therapy evaluation was done as well as physical therapy evaluation.
He was still NPO with a temperature of 101 max.
An ultrasound on [**12-27**] demonstrated an echogenic right liver lobe, no duct dilatation, common bile duct at 3 mm, portal vein was patent with normal flow.
White blood cell count was 8.4, hematocrit 33.4.
A bedside swallow evaluation was repeated.
A urine culture was done that demonstrated E. coli greater than 100,000 colonies pansensitive.
Blood cultures on [**12-28**] were negative.
Repeat blood cultures on [**12-30**] and repeat urine cultures on [**12-30**] were subsequently negative.
He had blood cultures and urine cultures repeated.
His incision was opened and few staples were removed.
Blood and urine cultures were repeated.
Portable chest x-ray was done.
Chest x-ray demonstrated improved fluid status versus prior chest x-ray.
EKG was done that demonstrated a probable multifocal atrial tachycardia with nonspecific ST wave changes.
An abdominal CT was done on [**2141-1-2**] to assess for fluid collection/abscess/bile leak.
The CT demonstrated left hepatectomy, there was evidence of a thin sliver of fluid extending along the surface.
A repeat physical therapy evaluation was done.
This was subsequently discontinued after review CT findings by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
LABS UPON DISCHARGE:  White blood cell count 5.3, hematocrit 30.1, platelet count 292.
Sodium 137, potassium 3.7, chloride 108, CO2 22, BUN 13, creatinine 0.8, and glucose 97.
AST was 30, ALT 44, alkaline phosphatase 107, T bilirubin 0.4, albumin 2.6, PT 13.5, PTT 24.1, INR 1.2, calcium 8, magnesium 1.8, phosphorus 2.4.
