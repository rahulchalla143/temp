===================== MICRO: ===================== Blood cultures x2 pending Urine culture pending .
[**6-24**] (febrile to 101.7) Blood cultures Urine culture Stool Cdiff .
CT abd/pelvis [**6-22**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
KUB [**6-22**]: marked gaseous distension, large bowel up to 11-12 cm, gas seen within small bowel, no gas seen in rectum.
KUB [**6-23**] (wetread): continued gas-distended dilated loops of small and large bowel, similar to slightly progressed from 6 hrs prior.
CXR [**6-22**]: increased retrocardiac opacity, atelectasis v developing infection, increased perihilar markings and cardiomegaly.
ECHO [**6-23**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
HIDA Scan [**6-23**]: INTERPRETATION: Serial images over the abdomen show uptake of tracer into the hepatic parenchyma.
At 43 minutes, the exam was terminated due to patient claustrophobia.
LENIS legs [**6-24**]: FINDINGS: Color and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale son[**Name (NI) **] was performed on the bilateral lower extremities.
Brief Hospital Course: 82M w/polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] and myeloproliferative disorder re-presents from rehab facility with persistent lethargy, found to have dilated bowel, obstructive LFTs, and negative head imaging in addition to chronically elevated WBC/Plt/splenomegaly, admitted direct to the ICU for workup and management.
Echo showed normal EF (70%) with no significant valve pathology.
Doppler ultrasound of the portal vein was negative for thrombus, and CT head showed no signs of bleed or infarction.
TSH was normal.
Additional blood and urine cultures + Cdiff test were sent.
Urinalysis showed new leukesterase and WBCs.
Serial KUB in context of worsening abdominal distension and fever showed free air under the diaphragm.
Rectal exam showed no impaction, no masses, stool guaiac negative.
Serial KUB obtained for worsening abdominal exam showed free air under the diaphragm.
HIDA scan showed delayed gallbladder filling but no obstruction.
Albumin was normal.
Admission EKG showed a RBBB, new since last EKG 1 day prior.
Serial cardiac enzymes showed negative CKMB, trop 0.02.
Echo revealed no wall motion artifact within a limited exam.
Hct stable over past week, but likely down from baseline due to extensive soft tissue bleeding evidenced on exam.
No e/o thrombosis on imaging: negative LENIs during prior admission, head CT negative, limited RUS doppler study negative.
Heme consult did not feel patient's current clinical picture aroused sufficient concern for heme malignancy, so no bone marrow biopsy was performed.
Bladder pressure, obtained for question of increased intra-abdominal pressure as a cause for anuria, was normal.
Patient was given lasix to promote diuresis and urine output, with minimal response.
Patient had a speech & swallow evaluation during his last admission, with concern for aspiration given coughing observed while eating/drinking.
