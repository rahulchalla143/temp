He underwent exchange transfusion for parasitemia >10%, with repeat smear showing 2%.
He had one episode of hypotension following exchange transfusion which responded to 500cc fluid bolus.

IMAGING: CXR [**2158-12-28**] A left subclavian approach central venous catheter remains malpositioned demonstrating a curve and a cephalolateral orientation of the tip.
The remainder of the examination is unchanged.
Parasite smear was done showing a parasitemia of 12.5%.
On HD 2 following exchange transfusion, pt was stable and was transferred out of the ICU.
His parasite count continued to decrease and patient continued to improve.
Because of his significant improvement, and the development of hallucinations, he was switched from quinine to atovaquone; clindamycin was changed to azithromycin.
# Hallucinations: After initiation of quinine, pt noted "voluntary hallucinations" which he could control and manipulate.
His hallucinations resolved within 1 day of discontinuing quinine.
His platelet count returned to [**Location 213**] by time of discharge.
# transaminitis: Pt also presented with significant transaminitis with ALT 777, AST 838, LDH 2399, and total bili 3.9.
He should have repeat labs draw at follow up appointment to trend progress of platelets, and LFTs.
You had an exchange transfusion to remove the parasite.
Your kidney and liver function responded appropriately, though your liver enzymes are still mildly elevated.
However, during your hospital stay, you developed hallucinations and hearing impairment, possibly due to quinine.
