In the [**Last Name (LF) 153**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] IJ central line catheter was placed for pheresis given her WBC of 257 and risk for leukostasis.
After pheresis, her WBC count dropped to 127.
Bone marrow biopsy was not done for evidence of remission as patient does not wish to have further chemotherapy, regardless of potential result.
CT chest/abd found new nodule in LLL that was increasing in size suggesting infectious process.
Sinus CT found possible involvement of the right maxillary sinus.
ENT was consulted and swab culture of the sinus was unrevealing.
Before being transferred to the ICU for the second time during this admission, she also developed hypotension with SBP in 80s after receving ambisome.
She responded to fluid boluses and did not require pressor support.
Cultures were negative.
A CT chest/abd ([**7-1**]) found enlarging nodule in LLL, and sinus CT found possible involvement of the right maxillary sinus with oral-antral fistula.
# Ischemic CVA - pt w/ new isolated L-sided mouth droop since [**6-18**], neurology was consulted, MRI showed subtle area of ischemia in centrum stemi ovale, extending into right insula (vascular territory of R MCA), echo w/ bubble showed PFO, doppler of bilateral LEs negative.
Dermatology was consulted and believed the rash was dependent erythema with early miliaria from recent fevers, biopsy showed likely drug hypersensitivity reaction.
