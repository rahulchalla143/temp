An echo done on [**9-30**] showed a dilated right ventricle with hypertrophy and depressed function, consistent with RV pressure overload, severe pulmonary stenosis.
A CAT scan also done at that time showed a 2-3 cm mass in the main pulmonary artery with calcifications.
Last renal ultrasound was in [**2112-10-21**], normal left kidney, status post CCY, status post appendectomy, status post hysterectomy.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 12.4, hematocrit 41.2, platelets 263, sodium 140, potassium 4.9, chloride 106, CO2 of 22, BUN 21, creatinine 1.2, glucose 92.
Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Following an extensive workup which includes ultrasound, TEE, MRA and cardiac catheterization which showed normal coronaries and a large calcific plaque distal to the pulmonary vein, the patient was ultimately scheduled for pulmonary vein homograft repair with excision of the pulmonary artery mass and on [**10-8**], the patient was brought to the operating room.
The patient remained in the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring as well as respiratory monitoring.
At the time of this dictation, patient's physical exam is as follows.
Vital signs:  Temperature 98.4, heart rate 86, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 95/63, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 93 percent on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 12.3, hematocrit 34.6, platelets 393, sodium 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 105, CO2 of 19, BUN 17, creatinine 1.0, glucose 102.
