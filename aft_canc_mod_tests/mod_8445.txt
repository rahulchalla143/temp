TWF stable from previous EKG [**2164-9-18**]  TTE: [**2164-9-28**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Mild pulmonary hypertension  CXR [**2164-9-28**]- FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**9-27**], the central catheters remain in place.
RENAL U/S [**2164-9-29**]- FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited due to patient's body habitus and presence of a large ostomy bag.
Further evaluation for masses or stones is very limited, however, none were seen.
CXR [**2164-9-30**]- There are lower lung volumes.
CXR [**2164-10-2**]- The PICC line is identified within the proximal basilic vein on the right side.
Initial PTT/INR elevated, thought some effect from prophylactic heparin SC patient was getting at [**Hospital1 1501**].
Pt received 1 unit PRBC in the ED for Hct 26.4.
INR remained elevated during hospitalization, and patient was not administered during admission due to this.
Patient was still orthostatic after fluid so albumin infusion was given along with 2 units PRBC as noted above and urine output picked up.
Briefly, patient was given stress dose steroids for random cortisol of 12.4.
PICC line was left in place from previous admission, which was the patient's only source of access.
Further tests to determine the patient's altered mental status were not pursued.
Ultrasound was performed revealing no evidence of DVT.
Vancomycin was held while in ICU and troughs were followed but never became sub-threrapeutic before floor transfer.
ECHO on [**9-28**] done for concern over cardiac systolic decompensation with volume overload.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution [**Hospital1 **]: Two (2) mL Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
Megace Oral 400 mg/10 mL (40 mg/mL) Suspension [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) PO twice a day.
