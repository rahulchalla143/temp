HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 73-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for multiple myeloma, peptic ulcer disease, cholangitis, iron deficiency anemia, B12 deficiency anemia, status post cholecystectomy and appendectomy, who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital3 **] for an ERCP.
The patient had an ERCP that was done on [**2-9**], and had a stent placed with no significant findings except for mild dilatation, but no stones or strictures.
A MRI that was done after [**2-9**] showed abnormal tissue in the region of porta hepatis and some lymphadenopathy.
During the ERCP procedure, the initial contrast revealed an amorphous intraductal mass.
With further manipulation and extraction of the mass, there was an old blood clot and once the blood clot was removed, bright red blood began to drain from the biliary system.
The GI fellow estimated about 1 unit of blood loss.
An A-gram was done that showed no active bleeding, however, the stent that was placed in the common bile duct was no longer there.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO THE UNIT:  Temperature of 97.0, blood pressure 130/55, heart rate of 105, respiratory rate 20, and O2 saturation 100% on room air.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2 slightly tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops heard.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 5.3, hematocrit 21.2, platelets of 301, sodium 133, potassium 3.1, chloride 106, bicarb 20, BUN 13, creatinine 0.4, glucose 117, ALT 303, AST 167, alkaline phosphatase 704, total bilirubin 1.2.
GI:  Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit after an ERCP because of a bleed.
The patient's hematocrit at that time was 21.2 and the patient received 2 units and hematocrit was checked q6h for 24-48 hours.
His hematocrit continued to remain stable between 25-27, however, one additional unit of blood was given when the patient was transferred to the floor and his hematocrit continued to remain stable in the range of 29-31.
The patient also had a repeat CT angiogram for pancreatic protocol that was done on [**2-23**], and it was found that there was no evidence of any mass and patient had a dilated common bile duct with wall thickening and enhancement which is consistent with either hemobilia or cholangitis.
In addition, the CT angiogram did show extensive bony involvement of his multiple myeloma.
Oncology:  The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, and as per the CT angiogram, it appears that there is extensive metastases to the bones.
A brief discussion was brought up with the patient regarding further management, and if he wanted to see an oncologist at that time, he said that his care is provided by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 49935**] in the [**Location (un) 5871**] area, and patient would want to talk to him before pursuing any further intervention.
