ECHO [**11-7**]: IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-11-15**], the findings are similar.
CT Head W/O contrast: Final Report: INDICATION: 71-year-old male with non-STEMI and lung mass concerning for malignancy.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous non-contrast axial images were acquired through the brain, with multiplanar reformations.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Chest X-ray [**11-8**]: FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.
#Pleural Fluid: Negative for malignant cells  #CT-guided Pleural Biopsy:  Peliminary Report:  Positive for malignancy  Labs on discharge:  [**2192-11-16**] 06:00AM BLOOD Glucose-15* UreaN-112* Creat-5.5* Na-137 K-5.7* Cl-100 HCO3-22 AnGap-21* [**2192-11-16**] 06:00AM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-6.3* Mg-2.3  Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 71 year old male with pmh of coronary artery disease s/p CABG, CHF, CKD (baseline Cr [**3-30**]), hypertension, a fib w/ PPM on amiodarone, hyperlipidemia, DM2 on insulin with recent admissions for CHF exacerbation, NSTEMI/pneumonia who represents with worsening dyspnea on exertion.
Pt initially had a thoracentesis that was negative for malignant cells.
Pt then had a CT-giuded IR biopsy on Tuesday [**11-13**] which did confirm the presumed diagnosis of malignancy.
# Acute on Chronic renal failure - pt p/w Cr 5.9, worse than his baseline.
His creatinine intially trended downward to a nadir of 4.7 before steadily rising to 5.5 on discharge.
Non-invasive SBP's were persistently in the 90's and 100's throughout the admission, likely representing the pt's baseline BP because of CHF.
Chest x-ray's did not show any sign of pneumonia and pt was afebrile (pt with baseline leukocytosis).
Echo did not show any acute worsening of pump function.
He will be discharged with daily kayexalate to reduce potassium levels and for contibued constipation.
# Pleural effusion and multiple pulmonary nodules- Initial pleural biopsy results were consistent with malignancy.
# Leukocytosis - Has had chronic WBC of 20-30 since [**Month (only) 216**] most likely [**2-29**] lung malignancy.
Does have history of severe bleed into renal cyst and was recently on heparin, however no evidence of active bleed throughout the admission  # Abdominal pain: Thought to be [**2-29**] fluid distention of abdomen or MSK in nature as CT scan from [**9-/2192**] showed no evidence for an acute process.
