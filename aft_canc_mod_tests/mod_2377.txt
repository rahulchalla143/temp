Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] is a 39-year-old gentleman with chronic repiratory failure, vent dependent, secondary to GVHD-associated bronchiolitis obliterans who was admitted for ventilator associated pneumonia with sputum cultures growing multiple strains of multi-drug resistant pseudomonas.
Vanco IV and flagyl were added as well, as Mr. [**Known lastname 38651**] white count seemed to go down on these medications.
A CT chest on [**4-27**] showed increased bilateral pleural effusions without evidence of empyema.
Sputum cultures continued to show multi-drug resistent pseudomonas.
Multiple urine and blood cultures were negative.
Finally, it was thought that fevers/white count may be the results of underlying GVHD, and prednisone was increased from 15mg to 40mg; however, as fevers resolved and white count remained stable, prednisone was decreased to baseline of 15mg QD.
His fevers stopped and his white count remained stable on these medications.
The vancomycin and the flagyl were discontinued as per ID and heme/onc recommendations.
He also had a RUQ [**Known lastname 950**] that was unchanged from prior.
Systemic anticoagulation was not initiated in context of history of GI bleeding (we DID NOT give Lovenox, Coumadin, or IV heparin).
Resolution of DVT should be evaluated as an outpatient.
ELEVATED CREATININE:  Creatinine rose from 0.2 to 0.4 after patient was started on nephrotoxic drugs including colistin and amikacin.
Creatinine remained stable at 0.4 for over 1 week.
