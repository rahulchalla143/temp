A CT scan was done which showed a Right temporal mass with surrounding edema and 2mm of midline shift.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch and proprioception bilaterally  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements  EXAM ON DISCHARGE: Neurologically intact.

Differential considerations primarily include a neoplasm which could either represent a primary glioblastoma versus metastatic disease.
Another primary bone lesion, either benign or malignant, would also be a consideration  CT Head Post op [**5-3**]: 1.
Leftward shift of normally midline structures is stable since [**2143-5-2**]  MRI HEad Post op [**5-5**]: The patient is status post right temporal craniotomy.
After the administration of gadolinium contrast, there is nodular pattern of enhancement, the possibility of residual mass cannot be completely excluded, followup is recommended.
He had a post-op Head CT that demonstrated no post op hemorrhage and complete resection.
