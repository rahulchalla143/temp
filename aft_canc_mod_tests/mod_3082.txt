The patient underwent an arteriogram on [**2157-1-21**] which demonstrated aortoiliac disease which was extensive, a 2-3 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm, which extended to the left common iliac artery, the left SFA was totally occluded, the left popliteal was totally occluded, there was three vessel runoff with the proximal occlusion with slow reconstruction of the distal AT and the dorsalis pedis was patent.
Borderline thyroid functions which have not been treated.
Negative chest pain, negative PND, orthopnea, and congestive heart failure negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature of 96.2, pulse 97, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 214/100 in the right arm and 167/100 in the left.
HEENT examination is unremarkable.
The abdominal aorta demonstrates an abdominal aortic aneurysm on palpation without tenderness.
The bone-joint examination shows bilateral ruborous changes left greater than right on the foot.
Hematology was requested to see the patient secondary to elevated INR and PTT with a total white count of 20.3.
Hematology felt the patient had polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] that if the hematocrit is greater than 54, that he would require phlebotimization for at least [**2-11**] units of red blood cells, and at a later date may need a bone marrow to rule out any myelosuppressive disease.
Recommendations were also made regarding the patient undergoing a P-MIBI to risk stratify the patient and to increase his beta blockade to improve his systolic blood pressure, and heart rate.
The nuclear study demonstrated no myocardial perfusion defects were seen.
Preoperative chest x-ray was unremarkable.
As per Hematology's recommendations, the patient's hematocrit was greater than 56.
He underwent phlebotomization of 2 units of packed red blood cells over 48 hours with a post-transfusion phlebotomization of 51.3.
The Lopressor was adjusted with a significant improvement in his systolic blood pressure to 120/890 with a pulse rate of 76.
His postoperative hematocrit was 46, BUN 16, creatinine 1.0.
He remained hemodynamically stable with a systolic blood pressure 139, diastolic 47, heart rate 74.
Serial enzymes were not required.
He continued on his Lopressor 25 tid, and he should follow up with his primary care physician for continued blood pressure management and polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] followup.
