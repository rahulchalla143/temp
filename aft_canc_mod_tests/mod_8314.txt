CT C-spine w/o contrast [**8-13**]: 1.
RUQ U/S [**8-13**]: 1.
Recommend MRCP for further evaluation if there are no contraindications to MRI.
Alternatively, a multiphasic CT of the abdomen should be performed.
CXR [**8-13**]: no intrathoracic process.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**8-14**]: There is a mass lesion involving the ampullary region which results in severe dilatation of the intra and extrahepatic biliary tree as well as mild main pancreatic ductal dilatation.
Differential considerations include a cholangiocarcinoma versus a pancreatic neoplasm.
EGD [**8-14**]: The duodenal bulb was dilated.
PERCUTANEOUS TRANSHEPATIC CHOLANGIOGRAPHY [**8-16**]: 1.

Due to her hypotension, CT scan was initially post-poned.
Upon review of CT Abdomen/Pelvis, it was determined that the patient had a potentially operable lesion.
On [**8-23**], the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with biopsy of periduodenal nodule, cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y, choledochojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
She required aggressive IV fluid hydration post-operatively, which she responded well to, as gauged by her urine output and vitals, which remained hemodynamically stable and normal throughout.
Due to a hematocrit of 23, she was transfused 2 units of Packed Red Blood Cells on this day.
Her NGT was clamped on this day, and residuals were checked every four hours.
On POD#8 ([**8-31**]), per recommendations by Hematology/Oncology, a CT Chest was obtained for staging purposes.
The patient's blood sugar was monitored regularly throughout the stay; sliding scale insulin was administered when indicated.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the surgery service at [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation of your biliary obstruction.
