PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature maximum was 100.7 degrees Fahrenheit, temperature current was 98.6, her blood pressure was 104/60, her heart rate was 82, her respiratory rate was 16, and her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.
Head, neck, chest, cardiovascular, and extremity examinations were within normal limits.
Abdominal examination was notable for an ostomy with mild bleeding, although not perfuse.
Otherwise, the abdominal examination was unremarkable.
Neurologic examination was notable for 4/5 strength in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, and triceps.
The deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities bilaterally and 0 to 1+ patellar and ankle reflexes.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 16.3 (with 86% polys and 4% bands), her hematocrit was 30.4, and her platelet count was 167.
Chemistry-7 was notable for a sodium of 132, her bicarbonate was 17, and her creatinine was 1.1.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A magnetic resonance imaging of the spine essentially showed diffuse but unchanged metastatic disease to the spine as well as severe spinal stenosis at L4-L5 that was compressing nerve roots.
A chest x-ray showed no infiltrate or effusions and a Port-A-Cath in place.
Physical examination showed proximal muscle weakness.
Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse metastases, L4-L5 spinal stenosis squeezing on the nerve roots, but no change since the [**2167-10-24**] magnetic resonance imaging.
An electromyogram was done that showed only very mild myopathy; not enough to explain symptoms.
A lumbar puncture was done by Interventional Radiology on [**2-29**] that showed no infection, and the cytology was negative for malignant cells, making leptomeningeal spread less likely despite the increased CEA.
A repeat abdominal pelvis computed tomography was unrevealing and showed unchanged disease.
However, several days into her hospital course, blood cultures drawn on [**2-29**] showed 4/4 bottles positive for Escherichia coli, and ceftriaxone was begun on [**3-1**].
She received a total of 4 liters of normal saline, and her systolic blood pressure was still in the 70s by the next morning, so she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where she stabilized after receiving a total of 5 liters.
An abdominal and pelvic computed tomography did not show any abscess.
Her temperature came down with the continued antibiotic therapy, and chemotherapy was started on [**3-10**] in an effort to decrease her tumor and therefore decrease the likelihood of macroperforation.
Blood cultures since the 4/4 bottles positive for Escherichia coli on [**Month (only) 958**] have been negative to date.
She received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells, and her hematocrit was now roughly stable.
