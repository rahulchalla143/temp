She initially presented in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2177**] to the heme onc clinic with complaing of neck pain due to bulky lymphadenompathy and CT scan revealed extensive lymphadenopathy, more severe in the deep pelvis, but also involved her paraspinal regions, retroperitoneum, inguinal regions as well as porta hepatis.
In the ED, her creatinine was significantly elevated (up to 8.1), CXR showed L-sided effusion with atelectasis/failure.
She denied any chest pain, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, fever, chills; she states that her urne has been decreasing over the past few weeks (but she still makes urine).

She had a renal biopsy on [**2-9**] that showed glomerular sclerosis consistent with end stage disease, likely from the lymphoma.
Urine lytes were consistent with renal pathology.
Renal ultrasound was without signs of hydronephrosis.
The following laboratory tests were performed: hepatitis serologies negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative,  SPEP negative, UPEP with albumin band, C3 low at 54, C4 normal, HIT antibody negative.
Tumor lysis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy laboratory testing were stabilized at discharge and will be monitored at hemodialysis.
Staging CT showed extensive disease.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2-12**] to begin chemotherapy coupled with hemodialysis and then to the medicine service [**2-14**] for continued monitoring and dialysis.
Tumor lysis and DIC labs were monitored and were stabilized at discharge, although they were briefly moderately positive the week after completing chemotherapy.
HIT antibody testing was negative.
She received 1 unit of PRBCs [**2179-2-18**] with hct increase from 24.9 to 28.9.
She did not require cryoprecipitate, FFP, or platelet transfusion and had no acute bleeding.
Phone ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3936**].
Her hematocrit trended down slowly due to chemotherapy and increased appropriately after transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs (see above).
