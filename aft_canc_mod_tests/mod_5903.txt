Pt had CT scan and MRI at OSH which showed large right frontal mass.
Pt was given decadron and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
CT Head [**2160-6-6**]: Postoperative changes noted in the right frontal lobe status post resection of right frontal extra-axial mass with residual air, fluid, and small amount of high density material likely representing blood products in the resection cavity.
MRI Brain [**2160-6-7**]: IMPRESSION: Incomplete study.
Linear right parafalcine extra-axial contrast enhancement could be reactive in the immediate postoperative setting, but residual tumor is difficult to exclude.
A repeated, complete study is recommended, when feasible.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
