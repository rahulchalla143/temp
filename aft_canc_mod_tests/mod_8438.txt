His potassium was measured at 6.1.
An arterial blood gas done at that time revealed a pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 26, PO2 of 63.
His heart rate was measured to be in the 130 to 170 range and atrial fibrillation.
For the shortness of breath, he received Lasix and his chest x-ray was done which showed infiltrates bilaterally, left worse than right.
He subsequently had a perfusion scan (apparently ventilation scan was not possible) which was interpreted as high probability for pulmonary embolus.
Although they were unable to perform the ventilation part, they did see complete perfusion defect in the right upper lobe area that was not observed to have infiltrates on the chest x-ray.
He subsequently had a decrease in his systolic blood pressure to 80 which improved with intravenous fluids for his cancer.
He had an MRI of his brain which was read as free of metastases.

Electrocardiogram - atrial fibrillation at 122 in S1 and at Q3, question of less than equal to [**Street Address(2) 28585**] elevation in V2 and V3, loss of R waves in V1 and V2.
He was initially placed on fractionated heparin over concerns of a possible pulmonary embolus based on outside hospital perfusion scan results.
However, there was some concern about whether the findings could be fully compatible with pulmonary embolus given the clinical history, so the patient underwent CT angiogram of the chest which revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolus, but did show significant parenchymal abnormalities with ground glass opacities and septal thickening, left greater than right, relative sparing of the right upper lobe.
Differential diagnoses for this was broad and included possible lymphangitic spread of tumor versus pneumonia or other interstitial lung process.
Bronchoscopy was done with lavage which yielded no organisms on gram stain that could definitively diagnose the pneumonia.
This could have been rate related, but given his electrocardiogram changes serial cardiac enzymes were sent which showed evidence of myocardial damage consistent with non ST elevations.
The patient had initially been on fractionated heparin although this had been stopped after a negative CT angiogram looking for pulmonary embolus.
