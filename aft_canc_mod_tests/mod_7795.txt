The patient was also found to have new heart failure in [**9-/2132**], with EF 40-45% (previous ECHOs with EF >55%).
Was thought that his heart dysfunction could be secondary to mid LAD ischemia, with suggestion of cardiac cath.
.. On initial evaluation in the ED, the patient was in respiratory distress, breathing at a rate of 30 and was triggered for hypoxia.
.. EKG in ED showing RBBB, no STE, mild depression V4-6, HR 106, NSR.
D-dimer elevated to 19,998 and BNP 8510.
A bedside ECHO showed no recurrence of pericardial effusion.
