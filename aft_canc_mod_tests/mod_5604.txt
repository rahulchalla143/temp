Funduscopic examination reveals sharp disks margins bilaterally.
Her reflexes are 0-1 and symmetric bilaterally.
Sensory examination is intact to touch and proprioception.
Coordination examination does not reveal gross dysmetria.
On the AP view, there is a metallic density overlying the left iliac in the region of the anterior superior iliac spine seen only on that view.
MRI hip:  No evidence of avascular necrosis.
LV size, thickness and systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**8-14**] head CT: Stable appearance of the brain parenchyma in comparison to the prior exams.

She was admitted for her 5th cycle of high-dose MTX and underwent the standard urine alkalinization and hydration with D51/2NS with 3amps of bicarb at 150cc/hr and given 650mg bicarb TID.
Strict Is/Os were kept and Lasix was administered to attempt to maintain fluid balance.
However, she became several liters positive and gained 6 lbs, stopped diuresing to the given doses of Lasix and on [**2201-8-14**] she was found to have a MTX level of 488, oliguria, altered mental status, hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia to 38.
She tolerate the hemodialysis well, and her MTX levels decreased incrementally (488, 137, 43, 23, 9, 2.5, 1.21, 0.96, 0.73, 0.4, 0.18, and 0.1).
Urine pH was kept at 8 to 9 during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
Her last hemodialysis was on [**2201-8-26**] and her creatinine continued to trend downward to a level of 0.1 on the date of discharge.
A hip xray was obtained which revealed no fractures, however she complained of pain on her left during the hospitalization.
An MRI of the left hip was also done which showed bursitis/tendonitis.
Daily Dilantin levels were checked with one time bolus doses given if her level (corrected for albumin) dropped below 15.
Periodic EKGs were checked which did not show any QTc prolongation.
Further brain imaging should be done at a later date to access for response to her MTX treatments.
A CXR was done which showed worsening pulmonary edema likely due to the fluid she received for MTX therapy.
She had gained 10 lbs over the week in the hospital and examination was positive for bibasilar crackles.
CXR were c/w pulmonary edema.
After her transfer back to the floor she continued to have poorly controlled hypertension and had one incident of pulmonary edema/respiratory distress associated with SBP of 180.
She is being sent out on lisinopril, amlodipine, labetelol, and isosorbide mononitrate (see medications below)  (8) Anemia: This is not from iron deficient, B12 and folate levels normal.
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her ACEI was held due to ARF, and she was put on amplodipine.
