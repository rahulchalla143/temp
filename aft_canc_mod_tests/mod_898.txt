A chest CAT scan was done on [**8-10**] which revealed a right upper lobe consolidation.
A biopsy of this consolidation showed that it was a mucoid mycosis, and consequently Thoracic Surgery was consulted on [**8-14**] to evaluate the need to resect the right upper lobe.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On examination, the patient's temperature was 100.6, pulse was 112, respirations were 20, blood pressure was 140/80, 98% on 35% shovel mask.
His head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination was significant for lymphadenopathy in the cervical and submandibular region.
Chest examination revealed the patient was noted to right inspiratory and expiratory wheezes with rales.
His left chest was clear to auscultation.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His white blood cell count was 36.1, with a hematocrit of 25.7, and platelets were 44.
His electrolytes revealed sodium was 141, potassium was 4.4, chloride was 106, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 110.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   He had a chest CT which revealed a right upper lobe opacity measuring 6.7 cm X 8.7 cm; which was increased from his previous CT scan of 4.1 cm X 4.5 cm.
A CAT scan of his abdomen also showed right basilar nodules in the right base of his lung measuring approximately 8 mm.
A biopsy of his left axilla lymph node showed that there was no evidence of disseminated fungal infection.
However, despite a pressure of 30 with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, leaving a plateau pressure of around 35, it was very difficult to ventilate the patient.
However, the patient's creatinine increased from 1 to 1.9.
Moreover, his blood pressure began to drop, requiring the addition of Neo-Synephrine to maintain an adequate mean arterial pressure.
Next, his blood pressure became an issue again requiring the addition of a second [**Doctor Last Name 360**]; we added Levophed to maintain his blood pressure.
Fluid boluses did not appear to help his blood pressure or his perfusion.
Moreover, his renal function also deteriorated with his creatinine increasing to 3.7 the next morning, which quickly increased to over 5 the same afternoon.
In the morning of [**8-19**], the patient's systolic blood pressure dropped to the 70s despite very high doses of Neo-Synephrine and Levophed.
His oxygen saturation dropped into the 80s despite being on 100% FIO2.
Nevertheless; at 7:55 a.m. on [**2115-8-19**], the patient's blood pressure continued to drop, followed by his heart rate, and finally he became asystolic and expired at exactly 7:55 a.m. on [**2115-8-19**].
