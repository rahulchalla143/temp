During his first fall this morning, he declined further evaluation despite head strike.
In the ED, initial VS were 5 97.7 91 94/59 16 93% RA FSGLC 190 Exam significant for skin tears to L arm and slight R hip, frontal hemotoma, bruising on the extremities.
He was given 1 L NS without much change in [**Age over 90 **] pressure for which a CVL was placed with CXR confirming placement.
Labs were significant for Hgb 5.9 (Baseline 7.4-9.3) with repeat of 5.9, Plt 29 (near baseline), K 5.5, BUN 42, Cr 1.9 (Baseline 1.3-1.4).
EKG showed NSR with LAD and poor R-wave transitions similar to prior.
Head CT showed small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right lateral sulcus just posterior to the right insula and sylvian fissure.
Neurosurgery was consulted for SAH and recommended repeat CT in AM with no AED needed at this time in addition to neuro checks.
He was given 1 bag of platelets and pRBCs were ordered before being sent to the MICU.
VS on transfer: 98.8 91 100/44 22 100 RA with GCS 15, AAOx3, non-focal neuro exam.
# [**2192-6-5**]: bone marrow biopsy consistent with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma or small lymphocytic lymphoma (total lymphocyte count <4,000), with plasma cell differentiation.
# [**2192-10-18**]: started on aranesp 30mg (0.45mcg/kg) q 2weeks # [**11/2192**]: repeat bone marrow biopsy consistent with MDS with 20q deletion in 13 out of 20 metaphases and no signs of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
Supportive care with Aranesp dose for MDS 300mcg every 2 weeks increased to 600mg and Neulasta 6mg every 2 weeks.

CT head ([**2193-6-5**]) Redistribution of subarachnoid [**Month/Day/Year **] with a slight increase in intraventricular hemorrhage located dependently in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, bilaterally.
CT ABD ([**2193-6-6**]) IMPRESSION: 1.
NCHCT in the ED showed Small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right lateral sulculs just posterior to the right insula.
Repeat NCHCT was stable and no interventions were necessary, and no anti-epileptics were warranted.
They did, however, recommend that ASA be held for one week and that he f/u in [**Age over 90 **] with repeat head CT in 4 weeks.
Patient was placed on telemetry which revealed sinus rythm, and an EKG did not show ischemic changes.
# Relative hypotension [**Name2 (NI) **] usually SBP 140-160 supine to 105 with standing.
No obvious source of infection with clear CXR and urinalysis although leukocytosis relative to baseline (WBC ~ 3 --> 5).
EKG without ischemia.
Patient does appear dry on exam and likely hypovolemic.
There was no evidence of GI bleed, hemolysis labs were negavtive and SAH would not have explained the degree of [**Name2 (NI) **] loss.
Reteroperitoneal bleed was ruled out with abdominal CT and no other sources of active bleeding were identified.
# Acute on chronic kidney disease:  BUN and Cr were elevated from baseline in the setting of poor po intake.
Creatinine began to correct with fluid resusitation and returned to a baseline of 1.6.
TRANSITION OF CARE: -f/u in neurosurgery [**Name2 (NI) **] with repeat head CT -f/u with hematology for neupogen and procrit -f/u with neurology for orthostatic hypotension w/u    Medications on Admission: 1. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
A CT scan of your head showed that there was a small amount of [**Known lastname **] around your brain, but it did not cause you any problems.
The neurosurgeons would like to make sure that this resolves, so they would like you to get a head CT in one month and go see them for a check-up.
Doctors in that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] will assess your orthostatic hypotension and figure out what medications might help you.
