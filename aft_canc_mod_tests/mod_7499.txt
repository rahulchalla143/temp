In the ED the patient's vital signs were T 97.7, BP 80/38, HR 70, RR 17, O2sat 88% on RA improved to 95% on 2L.
She was given 500cc NS for low blood pressure with good response to systolic 100-110.
One hour later BP trended down to systolic 80s and another 500cc NS was given again with good improvement in BP to systolic 110.
She had 300cc of urine output.
CXR showed new LLL opacity concerning for PNA with adjacent parapneumonic effusion.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn.
Consideration was given to CTA to rule out PE, however given patient's acute renal failure and low suspicion for PE the study was deferred for now.
The patient is being admitted to the ICU due to labile blood pressure in the ED.

Imaging: ========  CXR ([**2154-6-11**]): New left lower lung opacity concerning for pneumonia with adjacent parapneumonic effusion.
CXR ([**2154-6-12**]): In comparison with the study of [**6-11**], there is little change.
CXR ([**2154-6-23**]):  As compared to the previous examination, there is no major change.
CT Torso ([**2154-6-24**]):  1.
CT Head ([**2154-6-24**]):  No definite intracranial metastatic lesions.
Please note that the non-contrast technique of this head CT is significantly limited for assessment of intracranial metastatic disease.
If the patient cannot tolerate MR imaging with gadolinium due to implanted pacemaker/defibrillator or for other reasons, further evaluation with contrast-enhanced head CT is suggested as this is a more sensitive means of evaluation.
Other: ====== Transthoracic Echo ([**2154-6-18**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior free wall.

Cultures of the blood and pleural fluid were without growth at the time of transfer to the floor, but as per below the cytology was later found to be positive for malignant cells.
The patient's hypoxia resolved, saturating in the low-mid 90's% on room air.
She was started on Zosyn on [**2154-6-20**] after CXR showed a new R base pulmonary infiltrate.
CXR on [**6-23**] showed no improvement over CXR on [**6-19**].
WBC rose to 16 possibly from steroids, but blood cultures were repeated.
Sputum culture was sent on [**6-23**] which was negative.
WBC on [**6-24**] increased again to 16.4, blood cultures were drawn.
As the patient remained afebrile and WBC was trending down, antibiotics were stopped on [**2154-6-25**] (for a total of 5 days of Zosyn).
# NSCLC:  Pleural fluid cytology was found to be positive for non-small cell lung cancer, confirmed on [**2154-6-25**].
Chest/abdomen/pelvis CT ordered for further evaluation of showed no metastases outside the lungs.
Head CT without contrast also showed no metastases.
1100cc of blood fluid was removed on this tap.
Acute on CKD Stage III (baseline creat ~1.6)  After lasix 10 mg IV on [**6-19**] and [**6-20**] her Creat did rise to 1.9 with BUN of 55.
Her creatinine trended down to her baseline of [**12-23**].
Her weight continued to creep up even with multiple pleural taps and she had early satiety so her furosemide was restarted at 20mg.
CHF - lasix was on hold for hypotension & inc creat after lasix 20 mg IVP x's 1 on [**6-15**].
Lasix was restarted at 20mg on [**6-27**] as her weight increased to 168 lbs (baseline 160) and without improvement in her 02 sat s/p thoracentesis.
Her weight on [**2154-6-28**] was 165.8 lbs.
Cr slightly increased to 1.7 and K 5.0.
