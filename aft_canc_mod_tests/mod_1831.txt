He had one liter of IVF and mesenteric angiography which was negative.
In the MICU the patient's hematocrit was 25.
In the MICU he did have melanotic stool but hematocrit remained stable and was then transferred to the Medicine floor for further management.

Prothrombin time is 12.7.
CK and Troponins have remained within normal limits and the patient has ruled out for myocardial infarction.
He had a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy which was negative.
The patient then did have some blood per rectum and a tagged red blood cell scan was performed on [**8-11**] however, this did not reveal the source of bleeding either so again it is felt that perhaps a Heparin induced bleeding scan was the best course of action for this patient however, as stated above the bleeding then spontaneously resolved and the patient had no further episode of bright red blood per rectum and he had a stable hematocrit.
Hence it was decided that the patient would be discharged home for further follow-up with his primary care physician and that further workup could be considered as an outpatient should the patient have significant blood per rectum.
