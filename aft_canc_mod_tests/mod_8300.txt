Blood cultures x 6 no growth Urine cultures no growth  Imaging: CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2117-4-13**] 1:17 AM: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is now a severe left-sided pleural effusion that occupies more than half of the left hemithorax.
LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2117-4-16**] 4:36 PM: The left hemithorax is not completely opacified with complete collapse of the left lung and likely adjacent pleural effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-4-16**] 5:17 PM: Compared with earlier the same day, there is considerably improved aeration in the left upper and mid zones.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-4-22**] 11:06 AM: 1.
LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2117-4-27**] 10:14 AM In comparison with earlier study of this date, the PICC line has been pulled back to the subclavian vein, just to the right of the junction with the superior vena cava.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-4-27**] 4:29 AM: In comparison with study of [**4-26**], there is little overall change.
GS showed 2+PMNs, no micros, and culture was negative at OSH.
Patient was given vitamin k for an INR of 6 (on coumadin for afib) in preparation of surgery.
An old clotted hemothorax was removed and a fibrinous rind was noted on the visceral and parietal pleura.
Post op CXR showed a complete white out of his left hemithorax c/w proximal mucous plug.
Patient's vital signs were stable with good oxygenation.
Subsequent flex bronchoscopy showed mucous plugging in multiple left lobes.
Post bronch CXR showed reexpansion of left lung.
He failed a subsequent speech and swallow eval and was kept NPO (see GI).
Post bronch CXR again showed improved aeration bilat.
Post pull cxr was stable.
Two interrupted stitches were placed over CT wound.
Subsequent CXRs showed mild worsening of LLL consolidation quite similar to pre bronch imaging during the prior week.
Cultures were taken during these episodes and were all negative on culture.
Heme:  Patient required vit k preop for an INR of 6 on admission.
His thrombocytopenia is from a chronic myelodysplasia (prior BM bx at OSH) currently followed by his outpatient hematologist.
His electrolytes were replenished daily, particularly phosphate postoperatively.
