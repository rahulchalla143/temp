BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler examination of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed and demonstrate normal compressibility, augmentability and respiratory variation in flow.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the rectum.
Impression: Polyp in the rectum (biopsy) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Given poor prep, will need screening colonoscopy.
EGD [**2136-9-12**] Findings: Esophagus:  Other Esophagus with white plaques suggestive of candidiasis Stomach:  Other Erythema of the antrum suggestive of gastritis Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
His INR was reversed with vitamin K and FFP.
He underwent colonoscopy and endoscopy under MAC in the OR which showed a polyp in the rectum (biopsy) but otherwise otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum (evaluation limited by prep).
EGD showed esophagus with white plaques suggestive of candidiasis; erythema of the antrum suggestive of gastritis but otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.
Lower extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit weekly 9.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a week.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because you were found to have an INR of 9 and were having dark black bowel movements suggestive on bleeding in your intestine as well as feeling lightheaded, sweating, nausea and other symptoms suggestive of acute anemia (low red blood cell count).
You're vital signs stablized and you where transferred out of the ICU.
A colonoscopy and upper endoscopy was performed to look at your gastrointestinal tract to determine if there was a possible source for the bleeding.
Gastroenterology evaluation will start with a capsule endoscopy (camera pill) which will be ordered and arranged for you to do as an outpatient.
