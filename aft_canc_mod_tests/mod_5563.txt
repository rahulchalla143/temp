An EKG showed rate-related ST depression in V4 and V5.
Her rate did not respond to these blocking agents, and she had exquisite blood pressure sensitivity with frequent hypotension whenever she was given one of these agents.
In the setting of this new atrial fibrillation she was worked up for PE with lower extremity Dopplers which were negative.
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 70%, normal left atrial size, mild aortic stenosis, no pericardial effusion.
She was transferred to the intensive care unit on [**2148-7-12**] because of atrial fibrillation with a rate up to the 180s and a blood pressure drop to 80/palp with IV diltiazem.
Status post CVP in [**2145**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the unit her temperature was 97.1, heart rate 139, blood pressure 126/48, respiratory rate 31, 95% on two liters nasal cannula.
General examination was alert but oriented x self only, recognizes and interacts with her husband, appears fatigued and in mild respiratory distress, easily tearful and agitated.
Jugular venous pressure 9 cm.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.2, hematocrit 41.5, coagulation within normal limits.
CK 13, troponin less than 0.3.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema, innumerable pulmonary metastases, right lower lobe opacity and retrocardiac opacity.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rate of 130, normal axis, normal intervals, ST scooping in 1 and aVL, V5 and V6.
Bilateral lower extremity Dopplers were negative for deep venous thrombosis.
