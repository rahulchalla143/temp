[**2189-2-13**] CT a/p with PO and IV contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Post her ERCP for pancreatic head mass the patient was transferred to the TSICU with NGT in place given concern for duodenal perforation.
CT a/p with NGT and IV contrast demonstrated massive pneumoperitoneum/RP free air consistent with duodenal perforation.
They noted possible inferior ST wave depressions despite normalization of BP after HR control.
Formal cardiac rule-out back in TSICU was negative by clinical exam, EKG and cardiac enzymes.
Instead, they requested repeat CT scan, which showed no active extravasation of contrast from the duodenum.
Her home coumadin was restarted (2.5 mg) on HD8, [**2189-2-16**], and she should have her INR checked on [**2189-2-17**] at rehab.
