He called Dr.[**Name (NI) 6168**] office today and was told to increase his prednisone from 20 mg to 40 mg. Of note, he receives inhaled pentamadine for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] but has missed a few doses.
His ECG was sinus 94, old q in avF, LAD, LVH and new TWI in V4-V6.
Physical Exam: VS - T 97.2, BP 110/60, HR 100, RR 22, sats 95% RA Gen: Thin, cachectic male, +alopecia, NAD, nontoxic, no increased work of breathing HEENT: PERRL, EOMI.
Imaging: [**2200-8-20**] Chest CTA: 1.
[**8-23**] CT C Spine (prelim): 1.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-7-30**], no change.
Alignment of the right hip is within normal limits on the AP view, but not well evaluated on the lateral.
Respiratory failure-This patient developed apneic hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Pt was intubated and doing well but had poor negative inspiratory force with moderately reduced combined lung and chest wall compliance secondary to chronic GVHD changes.
Though he had a favorable RSBI when he was extubated on [**8-28**] he required reintubation after approx 2 hrs of extubation for increased work of breathing, likely related to mechanical muscle weakness.
Repeat bronchoscopy did not alleviate his respiratory failure and it was felt that he was continuing to mucous plug secondary to VAP and his inability to clear his own secretions.
VAP-While awaiting tracheostomy tube placement he developed increased FIO2 requirement, low-grade fever, and leukopenia with bandemia in the setting of new LLL and RUL opacity, so [**9-3**] was started on cefipime, vanco, levofloxacin for VAP.
Leukopenia-he developed leukopenia [**9-2**], with WBC count trending down during his hospital course, possibly myelosupression from medication vs infection vs myleodysplastic syndrome, differential showed bandemia suggestive of infection.
Chest pain- Around the time of extubation he developed chest pain with ST-T wave changes on ECG and elevated troponin thought to be stress induced tropinism.
Blood per rectum-he developed BRBPR on [**8-30**] and continued to have melenotic stools, most likely lower GI source due to rapid onset, DDx includes diverticulosis, AVM, hemmroids, ulcer, gastritis, DIC labs neg.
DIC labs neg, heparin dependent antibody neg, cellcept decreased per BMT rec due to potencial cause of thrombocytopenia .
