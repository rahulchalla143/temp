An echocardiogram revealed globally depressed systolic function (LVEF 35-40%), which is worse than her echocardiogram during her last admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
In addition, a Foley catheter was placed for urinary frequency, and a urine culture grew out >100,000 Enterococcus.
Physical Exam: VS - 94.2, 106/60, 64, 18 93% on RA Gen: Pleasant elderly woman lying in bed, NAD, appropriate HEENT: NCAT.
Conjunctiva had mild pallor  Neck: Supple with JVP of 6 cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.

Limited resting hemodynamic measurement demonstrated normal systemic arterial pressures.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 yo woman with HTN and NHL s/p recent chemotherapy and a recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] with after an NSTEMI treated medically.
She was pancytopenic from her recnet chemotherapy, however, and the procedure had to be delayed several days.
Was stable on transfer with cardiac enzymes trending down.
EKG at OSH with concern for lateral ischemia, EKGs relatively unchanged here.
We maintained her Hct near 30+ and her Plts >50.
After seeing that her counts begna to stabilize, the decision was made to pursue cardiac cath for symptoms.
She went for cath on [**11-9**] which revealed distal L main along with 3 vessel disease.
Pump:  Echo at OSH with interval worsening of systolic dysfunction.
She would benefit from ACE-I if her BP tolerates (baseline in 90s systolic).
Swallowing evaluation also done to assess risk of aspiration and ground solids and thin liquids were recommended.
