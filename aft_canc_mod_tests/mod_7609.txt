EKG revealed STD in V2-V6 as well as II, III, and AVF.
Labs were significant for a white count of 2.9 with differential of 48% neutrophils, hematocrit of 26.0, and platelet count of 21.
Serum chemistries were unremarkable.
Troponin-T was 0.56, CK 291, MB 36.
CT C-Spine Without Contrast: no acute process.
CT Head Without Contrast: no acute intracranial process.
Pelvic XR: ordered and pendin Her UA was significant only for an elevated Sp.Gravity.
She had two peripheral IV's placed and was fluid responsive to 2LNS.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2137-4-8**] at 3:00:00 PM      FINAL Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
CXR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2137-4-7**] 10:25 AM  FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size, accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement, new bilateral perihilar alveolar opacities and peripheral interstitial septal thickening.
LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2137-4-7**] 5:20 PM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-1**] and [**4-7**] at 10:11 a.m.:  Moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened slightly.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2137-4-8**] 3:27 AM IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema has improved since [**4-7**] at 5:05 p.m.:  Right PIC line has been partially withdrawn, tip projecting at the level of the superior cavoatrial junction.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2137-4-9**] 2:50 AM  Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 82F with HTN and GBM s/p resection, chemo, and radiation discharged 2 days ago from OMED admitted to the MICU for syncopal episode with NSTEMI, hypotension.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure -The patient's initial CXR showed interval development of pulmonary edema in the setting of global myocardial hypokinesis and fluid resuscitation (2L).
She had a CTA which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, no focal lung consolidation or evidenc of pneumonia and moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic calcifications and soft plaques at the descending thoracic aorta and significant calcifications of the coronary arteries.
She had a TTE which showed LVEF of 35%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel CAD, mild mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary artery hypertension.
As there was initially some concern for sepsis, Vancomycin/Cefepime were intially continued but were stopped on [**2137-4-9**] after patient's imaging revealed no infection and her respiratory status improved with diruesis.
