There are foci of increased susceptibility in the left parietal masses, consistent with blood products; while this appearance would also be consistent with calcification, no calcification was seen on the head CT of the same day.
In retrospect, the cortical thickening noted on the preceding CT scan was likely related to volume averaging artifact.
------ MRI [**6-27**]: FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the prior examination of [**2107-6-23**].
There is a small right cerebellar enhancing lesion with a mild amount of surrounding edema as noted on the prior examination consistent with metastatic disease.
Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 17510**] was admitted to the Neurology Service and underwent a MRI which showed a Left Occipital heterogenous enhancement and right cerebellar lesion.
CXR showed a mass in RML brain mass was thought to metastatic.
Intraoperatively he was noted to have an episode of bradycardia with rate 30-40s which did not effect his BP, he also had a similar episode in the recovery room which required administration of 0.5mg of Atropine.
He had post-operative MRI which showed no complications and was transferred to the surgical floor.
