[**2188-7-19**] CT SPINE: IMPRESSION: 1.

The measurements for the target lesions were updated in the oncology table.
[**2188-7-20**] CT NECK: IMPRESSION: 1.
No significant lymphadenopathy in the neck according to CT size criteria.
Bilateral peribronchial opacities at the lung apices, described in more details on the CT torso from the same day.
TTE [**7-23**]: The left atrium is elongated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-12-20**], no major change is evident.
Diffuse bilateral reticulonodular interstitial markings (right greater than left) likely represent lymphangitic carcinomatosis given clinical history, and is consistent with findings on chest CT from [**2188-7-20**].
IMPRESSION: 1) Persistent bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary infiltrates.
[**7-24**] Pleural fluid cytology: negative for malignant cells .
CT torso showed pneumonia and dependent effusion in L lung.
CT neck without obstruction of upper airways.
She completed an antibiotics course as follows: Meropenem ([**Date range (1) 41055**]), vancomycin and cipro ([**Date range (1) 31559**]), and Cefipime ([**Date range (1) 41056**]).
Patient was persistently febrile on antibiotics, and underwent thoracentesis and bronchoscopy/BAL, but all blood cultures, pleural fluid cultures and BAL cultures were negative.
In addition, a TTE was performed showing no evidence of any vegetations.
There was concern about possible extension into T9 vertebral body as well as T8 and she therefore also underwent bone scan on [**2188-7-15**].
This showed uptake at T8 adjacent to a larger photopenic area, likely related to osteoblastic activity in a known mixed lytic and sclerotic metastasis and minimally increased activity at multiple thoracic levels not as avid and extensive as would be expected from the appearance on CT suggesting the tumor is primarily osteoclastic, decreasing the sensitivity of the bone scan for visualization of metastatic disease.
CT T-spine with appropriate anatomical alignment, no evidence for hardware failure.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with no acute ischemic changes.
6) vaginal candidal infection on examination [**8-2**].
