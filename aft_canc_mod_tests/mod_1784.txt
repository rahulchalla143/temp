PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 101 to 104.0 F.; pulse 93; blood pressure 74/38 to 94/64; respiratory rate 18; oxygen saturation 99% on room air.
Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation with dull breath sounds bilaterally at the bases as well as fine crackles in both bases.
LABORATORY:  Pertinent data on admission was total white blood cell count 0.1, absolute neutrophil count 30.
Platelets 7, hematocrit 17, BUN 27, creatinine 1.4, blood glucose 569.
Chest x-ray without evidence for acute process.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to Four South/Oncology but due to hypotension which did not respond to fluid boluses and decreased mental status, the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Neo-Synephrine was required in addition to fluids to maintain the patient's blood pressure during the first one to two days of hospitalization.
The patient's blood cell counts rapidly recovered and Neupogen was discontinued.
The patient's white blood cell count continued to climb for two to three days after stopping the Neupogen until it peaked at 22.7 on hospital day nine.
The patient's blood cultures from admission grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in four out of four bottles and E. coli in one out of four bottles.
The E. coli was pan-sensitive and the Streptococcus pneumoniae was resistant to penicillin.
A CT scan of the abdomen without showed no evidence for any abscess or fluid collection.
Infectious Disease was consulted and based on the culture results postulated that the anal fissure as well as the PICC line were both unlikely sources for the Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Rheumatology was consulted to attempt aspiration of the metacarpal phalangeal joints, but upon evaluation, their recommendation consistent with that of Infectious Disease, was to image the hand to look for fluid collections or tenosynovitis given that the patient's examination was not consistent with metacarpal phalangeal joint involvement.
MRI of the left hand did in fact demonstrate a 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter abscess between the shafts of the second and third metacarpal bones.
The aspirated material was sent for culture and the results are pending at the time of this dictation.
The patient was sent for vascular ultrasound of the legs which demonstrated no deep vein thrombosis.
Ultrasound results were consistent with chronic episode of superficial phlebitis.
MRI of the left elbow demonstrated a 6 by 5 centimeter by 1.5 centimeter by 1.5 centimeter abscess in the distal belly of the brachialis muscle.
The patient was next sent for MRI of both lower extremities below the knee to rule out soft tissue abscess seeded from Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis as the source of the patient's bilateral lower extremity pain.
As of [**2123-1-3**], the patient's white blood cell count is 10.4, hematocrit 33.0 and platelets 270.
His creatinine is 0.9.
