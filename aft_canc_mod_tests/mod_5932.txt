On the floor, he developed hypotension and orthostatic symptoms with systolic blood pressure in the 80s and decrease in urine output.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
V/Q scan [**3-16**]: Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism  CT Abd/pelvis:  No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma   Brief Hospital Course: On post operative day 2, he developed hypotension and orthostatic symptoms with systolic blood pressure in the 80's.
His urine output also dropped off to minimal around that time.
After several liters of intravenous fluid, his blood pressure remained stable at his baseline.
His creatinine had bumpted from 0.9 to 1.9 at time of ICU transfer, however had returned to baseline after intravenous fluids and normalization of his blood pressure.
His urine output picked up and returned to baseline as well.
A V/Q scan was low probability for pulmonary embolism.
A transthoracic echo was obtained that demonstrated a small left ventricle, however it was unclear how this would contribute acutely to his symptoms.
During his stay in the ICU, his tachycardia gradually improved, and his heart rate was in the 80's to 90's at time of discharge to the floor.
There was no evidence of bleeding at the site of surgery, and repeated hemolysis laboratories were within normal limits.
A CT of his abdomen and pelvis was without any evidence of bleeding.
He was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**2129-3-19**] and his Hct remained stable thereafter.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Parvovirus B19 panel was pending at discharge.
Direct Coomb's test was negative.
Urine and blood cultures demonstrated no growth, and a chest x-ray was unremarkable.
