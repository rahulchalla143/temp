Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2131-9-7**] at 8:32:16 AM      FINAL  Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
The IVC is small, consistent with an RA pressure of <10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2131-9-10**] 10:56 AM The right internal jugular line tip is most likely at the cavoatrial junction.
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2131-9-10**] 11:58 AM IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
**FINAL REPORT [**2131-9-10**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2131-9-10**]):       GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
Imaging at [**Location (un) 620**] noted an ileocolic intussuception that is likely due to a lead point of tumor or polyp.
TTE done by fellow [**Last Name (un) 16997**] Tan showed mild global hypokinesis and worsened TR (baseline 2+).
Post-op Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia: She was cardioverted in PACU for chronic afib with RVR to 120s as her BP dropped to 70s.
Post-op UTI: On [**9-9**]: UA+-->GNR & Staph <1000/mL.
CXR: incr b/l effusion, worseing pulm edema vs. aspiration.
