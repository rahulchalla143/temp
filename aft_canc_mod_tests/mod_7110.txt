IMAGING: ECHO ([**2188-10-31**]) LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[**11-3**] Cardiac Cath COMMENTS: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left and right sided filling pressures of 19 and 13mmHg respectively.
There mildly elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure with a PASP of 32mmHg.
[**11-4**] CT chest noncontrast FINDINGS: The airways are patent to the segmental level.
Evaluation of hilar lymphadenopathy is limited due to the lack of IV contrast.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo male with history of hypogammaglobulinemia, low grade lymphoma and asthma, who presents with SOB, PND, orthopnea with CXR consistent with pulmonary edema and CHF exacerbation.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # acute decompensated systolic CHF: Pt admitted with acutely decompensated CHF, TTE revealed EF of 20% with regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Thyroid function tests, iron studies and HIV test were sent as part of work-up for new onset cardiomyopathy.
HIV and iron studies were normal.
Kappa and lambda light chains were also sent and pending at time of discharge.
Therefore this was changed to PO torsemide with significant improvement in urine output.
His potassium dropped with torsemide so he was discharged on potassium supplementation .
CT non-contrast and CTA/CTP were performed stat, which did not reveal intracranial hemorrhage or ischemia.
Work-up for SIADH included chest CT which showed no changes from previous CT. Pt sodium had normalized by time of discharge and urine osm decreased from 900s to 400s on torsemide.
INR was still subtherapeutic at time of discharge.
Given the suspicion of SIADH, a chest CT was performed, which did not reveal significant interval changes.
# Pt will need frequent monitoring of potassium due to initiation of torsemide.
# Pt should have sodium monitored as well, given that no clear source of SIADH has been identified.
His sodium was stable at time of discharge.
# INR will need to be monitored.
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed there were no blockages.
We started you on several new medications to control your sodium level and to control your fluid balance  Please make the following changes to your medications: 1.
Give lovenox shots 80mg twice a day until INR is theraputic ([**3-6**])  Please call your physician if you gain 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 1 week  Followup Instructions: Name: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Location: [**Location (un) 2274**]-[**University/College **] Address: [**Hospital1 3470**], [**University/College **],[**Numeric Identifier 23943**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 17530**] Appointment: Tuesday [**2188-11-11**] 10:00am *This is a follow up appointment of your hospitalization.
