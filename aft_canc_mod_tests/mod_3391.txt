[**2101-1-13**] T7 BONE/TISSUE BIOPSY 1.
T7 bone biopsy #1 (A-B): Malignant neoplasm, most likely carcinoma.
T7 bone biopsy #2 (C-D): Malignant neoplasm, most likely carcinoma.
Cell marker analysis was performed but was non-contributory in this case due to insufficient number of lymphoid cells for analysis.
Destructive bone lesion at T7 with SUV 12, and postoperative changes of the thoracic spine.
Digintal exam is recommended.
MRI of her T-spine showed a mass at the T7 level with extension to the epidural space and cord edema concerning for malignancy.
A lumbar puncture was performed to evaluate for leptomeningeal involvement.
CSF studies showed atypical plasmacytoid cells but it was not felt that the cells were malignant in nature.
A biopsy was taken of the T7 mass for further diagnosis.
The biospy revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary.
A skeletal survey was performed and did not demonstrate any evidence of lytic bone disease.
PTHRP was normal, but vitamin D was low.
Because her calcium normalized, no further work-up or intervention was pursued.
She required 2 units of PRBCs after which her hematocrit responded appropriately and was stable for the remainder of her stay.
