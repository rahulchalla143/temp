He initially was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] where CT neck revealed a C2 fracture.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 97.3 P: 130 BP: 124/78 R: 28 O2 sat 100% on NRB.
Since arrival to the TSICU he has had an MRI which shows a type II odontoind fracture.
He also has had a right forearm xray which revealed distal radial and ulnar styloid fractures which have been casted.
He was noted to be tachycardic and received significant doses of PRN metoprolol although telemetry strips appear to show sinus tachycardiac versus MAT.
ABG at the time of intubation was 7.29/65/85 on a non-rebreather.
He had a non-contrast CT of the test which showed a possible pneumonia versus atelectasis.

MRI C-spine w/o contrast [**2109-10-31**]: 1.
Ill-defined area of heterogeneous signal identified at the odontoid process, the possibility of chronic degenerative changes and an old unhealed fracture are considerations, however, correlation with a dedicated MRI of the cervical spine with contrast is recommended for further characterization.
Right Forearm XRAY [**2109-10-31**]: Study is limited due to the overlying cast material.
Evaluation for subtle fractures cannot be made on these images.
There is again seen innumerable erosions within the carpal bones which appear similar to the prior study of [**2108-9-11**].
If there is high clinical concern for subtle fractures, imaging without the cast may be more helpful.
Pelvis XRAY [**2109-10-31**]: No evidence of trauma.
MRI Head ([**2109-11-6**]): No evidence of acute infarct.
ABD Xray ([**2109-11-22**]): No signs of perforation or obstruction.
Patient without signs of infection, blood cultures, urine cultures have been negative.
During his stay an active type and screen was maintained and transfusion goal was set at 21.
Baseline: [**2106**] - [**4-4**] HCT ~41 Since Admission: [**10-31**] - [**11-5**] HCT ~ 26-32 [**11-6**] - [**11-17**] HCT ~ 22-26 [**11-18**] ~ 21, INR ~ 4, given 2 units PRBC + Vit K [**11-19**] ~ 27.9, INR = 1.2 [**11-24**] - 26.8, INR=1.2  ASPIRATION: Very high-risk.
Based on their evaluation the neck collar was not contributing to dysphagia.
Potassium 5.5, no EKG changes.
ABG intially showed well-compensated respiratory acidosis, later with acute decompensation.
Patient now stable on RA - 2L with sats in mid to upper 90s.
PNA: History of aspiration, some evidence of small infiltrates versus atelectasis on his CT chest.
After completion of course patient has been afebrile, with white blood cell count that continues to trend down.
On [**11-15**] chest xray concern for aspiration pneumonitis.
Since that time CXR has been stable with segmental atelectasis.
# THROMBOCYTOSIS: platelet count rose to ~750 and is now trending down.
# AF w/RVR: rate and rythm controlled on beta-blockade.
HR 90-120s in ICU, now rate controlled on metoprolol.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Aspiration Pneumonitis 3.
Lower GI Bleed 7.
