Upon discharge, he was advised to follow-up with his PCP for repeat chest imaging to confirm resolution of the pneumonia.
He then saw his PCP roughly one month ago; plain radiography showed a clear chest but also disclosed an abdominal abnormality for which CT was advised.
This CT scan was done 3-4 weeks ago.
Following the CT scan, the patient travelled to [**Hospital3 **] for vacation as previously planned; he asked to be contact[**Name (NI) **] with the results of the imaging study but no one called him.
The pain became increasingly intolerable over the past several days, so he sought attention at an OSH where a CT scan reportedly showed a large (9 x 12 x 18 cm) soft tissue mass in the area of the lower pole of the left kidney.
The report of the non-contrast CT scan done in NY on [**7-21**] was subsequently obtained; it shows multiple lobulated masses forming a conglomerate size of at least 12 x 6.5 cm with obstruction near the level of the UPJ and dilatation of the intrarenal collection system and renal pelvis.
Based on the results of these imaging studies, the patient was referred here for further evaluation and treatment.
Past Medical History: 1. anxiety and panic attacks 2. pneumonia [**5-21**] 3. low back pain 4. colon perforation s/p primary repair [**2145**]  Social History: He lives in [**Location 66469**], NY with his second wife.
His WBC was 9.0, Hct 37%, and platelets were 460K.
OSH ECG shows normal sinus rhythm at 85 bpm, slight left axis deviation, normal intervals, and poor R wave progression.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2161-8-20**] 11:06 AM  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  Reason: r/o lymphona, mass, bleed.
TECHNIQUE: Multisequence multiplanar MR images of the head were obtained including pre- and post-gadolinium images.
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to head CT from [**2161-8-9**].
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are normal.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
[**2161-8-19**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The visualized portion of the lung bases demonstrate dependent atelectatic changes/infilterates at both lung bases which appear relatively stable compared to the prior studies.
The left retroperitoneal mass has significantly decreased in size, now measuring 47 x 15 mm compared to the prior study when it measured 106 x 34 mm.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, urinary bladder, distal ureters are unremarkable.
LUNG SCAN  [**2161-8-12**]  LUNG SCAN  Reason: 75 YEAR OLD MAN WITH RETROPERTONEAL LYMPHOMA, NEW AFIB AND DIALIATED RV CONCERNING FOR PUKM PROCESS  RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA: 5.1 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MAA ([**2161-8-12**]); 42.5 mCi Tc-99m DTPA Aerosol ([**2161-8-12**]); HISTORY: 75 YEAR OLD MAN WITH RETROPERTONEAL LYMPHOMA, NEW AFIB AND DIALIATED RV CONCERNING FOR PUKM PROCESS  INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol are markedly limited secondary to the inability of the patient to breathe in the radiopharmaceutical.
Perfusion images in the same 6 views demonstrate large defects within the superior segment of the right lower lobe and anterior segment of the right upper lobe.
Although the ventilation study is limited, it does show ventilation to these segments which is more uniform than the perfusion study.
Chest x-ray shows large left lower lobe atelectasis  IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation, but multiple perfusion defects place the study within a moderate or moderately high probability.
[**2161-8-3**] FINDINGS: The area of abnormality on the chest radiograph is predominantly linear in configuration on CT and is accompanied by volume loss with fissural displacement and crowding of bronchovascular structures.
Attention to this area on three-month followup CT is suggested.
Immunostains reveal that the large lymphoid cells are TdT+ positive, CD10 positive and negative for CD20, Bcl-6, Bcl-2, Bcl-1, CD5, CD3, DRC (CD21), with a proliferative fraction of approximately 80%.

[**2161-8-12**] Lower extremity US: FINDINGS: Comparison is made to left lower extremity Doppler ultrasound, [**2161-8-10**].
[**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of both lower extremities including the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
Biopsy was performed and pathology was consistent with pre-B-acute lymphoblastic lymphoma.
His uric acid peaked at 9.6 on [**8-10**] with an associated LDH of 2990 and he received one dose of rasburicase with rapid improvement in his uric acid levels.
He underwent CVP for 5 days, and completed his course on [**8-25**].
His LDH has trended down from 650 to 400. .
His creatinine peaked at 5.0.
Following this intervention his creatinine decreased from 5.0 to 0.9 over the following two days.
Repeat ultrasound confirmed that his hydronephrosis had resolved.
His creatinine was monitored closely and remained stable.
His hematocrit was subsequently watched closely in the setting of anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation and possible pulmonary embolism.
His hematocrit was stable for the remainder of his MICU course.
On transfer to the floor from the MICU, the patient remains with a stable creatinine of 0.7. .
Blood cultures from the 27th grew MRSA 8/8 bottles from his PICC line and peripheral blood cultures.
He had a TTE which showed no vegitations.
Subsequent blood cultures from the 28th and 29th have shown no growth.
His EKG showed no ischemic changes.
He underwent TTE which showed a moderately dilated right ventrical concerning for pulmonary embolism.
He underwent bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds which revealed a filling defect within the left common femoral vein which was thought to not represent an acute thrombus because it was fully compressible.
He underwent V/Q scan which was read as a limited study but moderate to moderately high probablity for pulmonary embolism.
His hematocrits were followed closely.
His rate remained initially 120-140.
His rate has now had a stable HR of 80-110 on this regimen.
IVC filter placed without complication and he was started on heparin for anticoagulation with close monitoring of his hematocrit.
PE CT was deferred given his recent renal failure and it was felt that previously obtained imaging modalities were conclusive for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
Given that there was no urine culture sent prior to initiation of antibiotics he was continued on ciprofloxacin for a 7 day course.
All urine cultures here were negative.
CT abdomen revealed encasement of the atient's ureter with tumor.
You will need to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in cardiology clinic for evaluation of your atrial fibrillation.
