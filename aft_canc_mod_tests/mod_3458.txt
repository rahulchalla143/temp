She thought she had a UTI, went to the Er and had a CT scan at that time.
CT scan showed and a renal mass invading the IVC.
A d/c summary was not sent with her but it appears upon arrival there her hct was 24.5 and it only bumped to 27.6 after 2 units.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Renal cell carcinoma with invasion of the IVC diagnosed by CT 3 weeks ago after patient noted hematuria.
Smoked 1 ppd till 6 months ago (previously smoked on and off for 40 yrs) Denies drug use, has occasional ETOH use  Family History: Grandmother with pancreatic cancer mother with abdominal cancer aunt had lung cancer  Physical Exam: VS: T 100.0 HR 90 BP150/70  RR 18 Sat 97% RA HEENT: anicteric sclera, MMM Neck: supple, no LAD Pulm: CTAB Cardio: RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur loudest at LUSB, nl S1 S2 Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, +BS, no hepatosplenomegaly Ext: no edema, 2+ DP pulses Neuro: Cn 2-12 intact, PERRL, muscle strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities, sensation to light touch intact Skin: few petechia on LLQ of abd Back: no point tenderness, no CVA tenderness  Pertinent Results: CT chest/abdomen from [**2155-6-2**] at OSH per reports: multiple b/l pulmonary nodules compatible with metastatic diseaes and the renal mass with filling defect involving the right renal vein into the vena cava but not the right atrium .
MRI ABDOMEN [**2155-6-19**]: [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 58 year old woman with presumed new diagnosis of metastatic renal cell CA with PROBABLE IVC involvement (per report from CT at OSH) REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess extent of tumor burden, IVC involvement, vascularity of malignancy CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired on a 1.5- Tesla magnet including dynamic 3D images acquired prior to, during, and after the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg gadolinium-DTPA.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformatted images were made and analyzed independently on an adjacent workstation.
There is a tiny well-circumscribed lesion in the inferior right lobe of the liver (segment VI) which is of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and is likely a cyst with rim enhancement.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction sequences were essential in evaluating vascular structures.
CT HEAD [**2155-6-24**]: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, enhancing mass lesions, shift of normally structures, or hydrocephalus.
.....MICRO: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2155-6-28**]):       STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
Blood Cultures        **FINAL REPORT [**2155-6-28**]**     AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2155-6-28**]):    NO GROWTH.
Her hematocrit continued to drop, and she was transfused 5 units of blood in the pre-operative period.
Of note, CT of the chest at an outside hospital showed multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with mesastatic disease.
A CT of the head was negative and an MRI of the abdomen showed extension of tumor into the IVC.
Of note, her urine output was normal, her creatinine was at baseline, and no active bleeding was seen in the urine.
Her hematocrit was noted to be down to 25 on POD 2 and she was transfused with 2 units pRBCs.
Her post-transfusion hematocrit on POD 3 was noted to be 30.
-check bcx, ucx, CXR -Urine culture was positive for MSSA and an alpha hemolytic gram positive bacteria.
-cont home regimen of 30 NPH [**Hospital1 **] -SSI and qid FS -postoperatively her blood sugars were stable with half doses of NPH while NPO.
