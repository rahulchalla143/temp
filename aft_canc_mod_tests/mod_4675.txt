F/U CT thorax on [**10-8**] revealed LUL mass 5 x 6.7 cm concerning for malignancy.
Endobronchial biopsies revealed poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Vitals at PCP's office were:  101.7, SBP 82/52, tachycardic to 115, and breathing 98% on RA; had diminished L upper lung breath sounds, per PCP.
Mechanical ventilation/intubation in PACU lowered PaCO2 to ~ mid-50's and patient was extubated, then transferred to the floor (O2 saturation > 90%).

CT Chest with Contrast ([**10-20**]): 1.
MRI Head With and Without Contrast ([**10-23**]): No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
CT Chest Without Contrast ([**10-23**]): 1.
Pleural Fluid Analysis ([**10-24**]): 4+ PMNs, no organisms, fluid culture without growth, anaerobic culture without growth.
FDG Tumor Imaging ([**10-26**]): 1.
Chest CT With Contrast ([**11-2**]): 1.
Blood Cultures were repeated 9 times during admission and were always without growth.
Chest X-Rays were repeated 11 times throughout admission and demonstrated left upper lobe post-obstructive pneumonia with little to no improvement.
Images later in stay further revealed almost complete white out of the left lung with collapse of the left lower lobe detected late in the hospital course.
Mediastinal Lymph Node Biopsy ([**11-12**]): 1.
Lymph node, 4R, biopsy (A-D): No malignancy identified.
Lymph node, 4L, biopsy (E-F): No malignancy identified.

# Hypotension: Patient presented with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
Patient was sent to the MICU and pressure came up to the 100s following 4L NS.
Lactate was 1.7.
Repeat chest x-rays throughout admission demonstrated little to no improvement in the post-obstructive pnemonia with subsequent collapse of the left lower lobe and progression of the ateletctasis of the left upper lobe.
Brain MRI showed early in the hospitalization revealed no evidence of brain metastases.
PET scan on [**10-26**] revealed mediastinal lymph nodes suspicious for metastases.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and performed a mediastinoscopy for which the sampled lymph nodes were negative for malignant cells.
# Pleural effusion: Pleural fluid  was negative for malignant cells on thoracentesis [**10-24**] with cultures showing no empyema.
An ultrasound study with Dopplers revealed non-occlusive thromboses of the bilateral popliteal, the right peroneal and the left posterior tibialis veins.
# Anemia: Hematocrit stable throughout admission.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
You had a brain MRI which did not show any metastases.
