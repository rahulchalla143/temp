An ultrasound found no RUE DVT.
Exam following this revealed a strong left radial putse but a notably weaker to absent right radial pulse as well as SBP decreased by 20-30 mmHg in the RUE.
An echocardiogram was done to evaluate an embolic source; this read is pending.

Compared to [**2115-12-24**], the Q waves are more makred and the ST segments have become more concave with new reciprocal changes.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2116-10-9**] CT torso w/ contrast: 1.
Peritoneal nodules, less confluent in appearance.
CT Head W/O Contrast [**2116-12-25**]: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass-effect.
1) Right brachial arterial thrombus: Patient was found to have a right brachial artery clot seen on ultrasound doppler on [**2116-12-25**], so was admitted for management.
Patient was started on heparin gtt after a head CT ruled out large mets, and he was evaluated by vascular surgery for thrombectomy.
After extensive discussions, patient did agree to take lovenox until INR is therapeutic on coumadin.
His oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will call patient tomorrow to schedule INR checks and follow up appointment.
2) EKG changes: After patient was admitted to OMED, his ECG revealed concerning ECG changes including ST depressions laterally and elevations in II, III, and aVL.
Because of the EKG changes, patient was transferred to CCU for further management.
His EKG changes were impressive for inferior ischemia, but given old Q's and flat CK's, lack of symptoms, essentially normal EF, it did not seem that this was new acute ischemia.
3) Metastatic Colon Cancer: Patient will need further staging and management given difficulties in maximizing therapy.
Patient will require outpatient psychiatry evaluation and treatment, and need close followup.
5) CKD: Baseline creatinine around 1.4-1.6, due to previous obstructive uropathy.
His creatinine was stable during this hospital stay.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: - Metastatic colorectal cancer - Right brachial artery thrombus  Secondary diagnoses: - Hypertension - history of right internal jugular vein thrombus in context of port-a-cath   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure to be involved in your care, Mr. [**Known lastname 61228**].
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a blood clot in your right arm.
As we discussed extensively, it is very important for you take the blood thinners to avoid complications from the blood clot such as limb ischemia and even limb loss.
While you were in the hospital, you were found to have EKG changes, and you were transferred to cardiac intensive care unit for management.
Your oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] call you tomorrow to arrange INR checks and the next follow up appointment with him.
