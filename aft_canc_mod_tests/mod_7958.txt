Examination was notable for a distended, tender, non-rigid abdomen with guarding.
Got 100 hydrocortisone, 2L NS, and Albumin 5% (12.5g / 250mL) x1.
Bladder scan showed > 800 cc and patient unable to void; foley placed with 35 cc UOP, likely that bladder saw ascites not urine.
Past Medical History: Oncologic History: Mr. [**Known lastname 59304**] presented to his PCP in [**2100-10-30**] for routine physical exam and reported he had some left lower quadrant abdominal discomfort.
He was referred to a surgeon for questionable hernia with CT scan on [**2100-11-18**] revealing a left kidney mass measuring 9 x 7.5 cm, with a larger exophytic component measuring approximately 12 cm abutting the abdominal wall.
Plain film of the left femur was done due to pain, revealing a lytic lesion.
Bone scan on [**2100-12-6**] revealed widespread bony disease.
Right heel MRI on [**2101-2-28**] demonstrated a metastatic bony lesion and he received radiation to that site, completing on [**2101-3-18**].
He was admitted [**Date range (3) 91600**] with anemia, ascites and disease progression noted on CT including lung/liver/peritoneam metastases.
RCC - as above 2.

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ECHO [**2101-9-8**] at 9:30:00 AM The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 75%) M-mode analysis of the aortic valve suggests premature systolic closure.
A left ventricular outflow tract obstruction cannot be excluded with certainty due to the technically suboptimal nature of this study.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
ECHO   Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2101-9-12**] at 2:20:00 PM FINAL Poor image quality.The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR 8.9  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared moderate left pleural effusion.
A definitive infectious source was never identified, though SBP was excluded with 2 large volume paracenteses.
Fluid resuscitation was performed with crystalloid and colloid without success.
Norepinephrine was added on the day of intubation added without improvement in urine output.
# Respiratory failure: The patient developed tachypnea and increased work of breathing on the morning of his expiration while undergoing a CT head.
A CXR did not show any acute intrapulmonary process.
Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVTs.
An ECHO did not show any RV strain.
A renal ultrasound did not show impaired renal flow.
Bladder pressures were consistently below 20.
Urine output did not improve after large volume paracentesis or after fluid resuscitation with crystalloid or colloid.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
