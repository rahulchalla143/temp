Here, she got an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed grade III esophageal varices which were banded.
Her hematocrit remained stable after the banding.
The patient also was found to have a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia in the Medical Intensive Care Unit after bronchoalveolar lavage was done which grew out this methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus.
She had initially failed her swallow study in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was placed on tube feeds.
b.i.d., calcium carbonate 1 g t.i.d., lactulose 30 mL q.4-6h.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Examination on transfer to the [**Hospital6 **] revealed a blood pressure of 70/31, pulse was 80, afebrile.
The patient was saturating at 95% on 2 liters via nasal cannula and had made less than 30 cc of urine over the past two hours.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed extraocular movements were intact.
The chest revealed poor air movement with wheezes bilaterally and anteriorly.
Cardiovascular examination was irregularly irregular rhythm.
Her pulses were 2+/4 in the dorsalis pedis and dorsalis pedis bilaterally.
Her skin showed no rashes.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on transfer revealed sodium was 140, potassium was 3.7, chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 15, creatinine was 0.5, blood glucose was 159.
White blood cell count was 8.8, hematocrit was 31.7, platelets were 304.
Calcium was 7.6, phosphorous was 2.8, magnesium was 2.1.
INR was 1.7, PTT was 35.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Her electrocardiogram from [**6-8**] showed low voltage and a question of chaotic atrial rhythm.
She had an echocardiogram that showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, with moderate pulmonary hypertension.
She had an abdominal CT which showed positive ascites, a positive cirrhotic liver, and a 7-mm liver mass.
A chest x-ray on [**6-14**] showed the nasogastric tube placed post pylorically with a left lower lobe atelectasis.
A chest CT on [**6-3**] showed right lower lobe consolidation, left basilar atelectasis, and ascites.
Hip and femur films from [**6-14**] showed distal right femur fracture and bilateral proximal tibial fractures.
Her past workup consisted of a workup for autoimmune hepatitis that showed a negative antinuclear antibody.
She had a follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**6-17**] in which she had three more bands placed.
She is currently being weaned off of her nasal cannula with saturations of 93% on room air.
The plan from a pulmonary standpoint was to continue to wean her from her oxygen and discontinue the oxacillin after her course was done.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has been fairly hypotensive for this entire admission with her blood pressure mostly in the 80s to the 60s.
She has continued in that range for most of her floor time; although, in the past day she has increased her blood pressure to be 120s/60s.
The patient's family at the current time did not want the patient to be aware of this diagnosis and does not want any further workup of her lung cancer.
Her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, however, have all been within normal limits throughout this hospitalization.
Her urine output has begun to pick up within the past two to three days; however, it is still much lower than her input.
It was thought that her renal function is normal at this time, and her oliguria is most likely a result of decreased effective circulating volume from her cirrhosis.
After her esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**6-17**], her nasogastric tube was removed and not replaced.
Her electrolytes have been stable throughout this admission.
She is more recently, with her continued lower urine output than input from intravenous fluids and oral intake, began to be having increased ascites and lower extremity edema.
as her blood pressure tolerates.
With her lower extremity edema, she was evaluated for deep venous thrombosis; and lower extremity Doppler tests were found to be negative.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient's diabetes and blood sugars have been well controlled on Glargine long-term and an insulin sliding-scale.
