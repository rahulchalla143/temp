pCO2 120 on ABG with low pO2.
CT head with findings somewhat concerning for SAH (later found to be misread).
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T P84 BP 112/80 R18 100%.
Trops 0.05-> 0.08.
Past Medical History: - OSA - does not wear mask he was prescribed - HTN - hypercholesterolemia - osteoporosis - s/p hernia repair (approx 10 years ago) - dental infections (approx [**2117-7-7**]), including mandibular infection - had colonoscopy at least 2-3 years ago  Social History: - Tobacco: smoked since being a teen, up to three packs per day, ~ 100 pack year history - Alcohol: rare - Illicits: none (per cousin) - Retired one year ago  Family History: Unknown.
Bilateral LE rash - erythematous macules with small papules, mostly blanching - over medial legs/ankles.

Images:  CT Head at [**Location (un) 620**]: INCREASED ATTENUATION OF THE INTRACRANIAL ARTERIES AND VENOUS SINUSES QUESTION PRIOR CONTRAST ADMINISTERED.
CONSIDER MRI OF THE HEAD AND MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD IF THERE IS NO CONTRAST INDICATION FOR BETTER ASSESSMENT OF THE BRAIN PARENCHYMA FOR FOCAL LESIONS.
CXR at [**Location (un) 620**]: Status post intubation.
The predescribed right lower lobe opacities are better seen than on the previous examination and still suggest either early pneumonia or status post aspiration.
Needs further evaluation with MR as previously recommended.
Improved aeration of the left lung in comparison to chest radiograph from [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital two hours prior.
Finally, regarding the exclusion of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, a CT scan is far more effective than an MRI in addressing this issue.
In that regard, a CT scan was performed yesterday and did not appear to disclose subarachnoid blood at that time.
Also, a CT angiogram, obtained yesterday as well, is quite useful in the exclusion of an aneurysm involving the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and major vascular tributaries.
For question of subarachnoid hemorrhage was transferred for Neurosurgical evaluation at [**Hospital1 18**].
Subsequent head CT negative here.
An inspiratory/expiratory CXR was ordered but the patient did not perform the needed respiratory maneuvers.
We decided not to repeat because his other chest x-rays have been quite nice inspiratory films, suggesting that if the diaphragm is weak, we may not see it this way.
PNA was quite possible based on thick secretions, cough, (he received an empiric course of Levaquin and Ceftriaxone) but CXRs are now clear and sputum examination has not been fruitful.
White Matter Disease MRI brain shows Binwanger changes with increased signal in subcortical white matter and pons that was not acute.
Your oxygenation improved over the next several days and you were able to leave ICU.
