Of note she was discharged two days ago to home with hospice care after being hospitalized for labial induration as well as peritoneal metastases with abdominal ascietes and RLE/pelvic thrombus found on CT scans.
She was also incidentally noted to have proctitis on her CT and was treated with 7 days of cipro/flagyl.
On arrival in the ED her initial VS were temp 97.3 heart rate 105 blood pressure 169/100 respiratory rate of 18 and O2 sats of 92% on room air.
Urinalysis showed moderate bacteria and a chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion.
A CT abdomen showed no evidence of active extravasation but showed multiple peritoneal and omental implants, ascietes, a right iliac [**Last Name (LF) 86508**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] occluded left common femoral artery (with patent nearby collaterals), a stable right renal infarct and a narrowed celiac oriigin as well as a left atrial filling defect which was not present on prior CTA and was felt to be consistent with a clot.
Vital signs prior to admission were temp of 97.9 heart rate 119 SBPs in the 120s and breathing 98% on 2L NC.

The renal arteries, SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent.
Cardiology: ECG Study Date of [**2197-1-8**]  6:00:30 PM   Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and occasional ventricular premature beats.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2196-12-27**] the rate is a little slower and the ventricular premature beats are new.
Read by: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **]    Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 129 0 70 302/422 0 -7 90   Brief Hospital Course: 82 year year-old female with metastatic uterine cancer, multiple comorbidities, nonverbal at baseline presented with concern for G tube bleeding and infection and found to be septic with likely UTI and likely DIC.
On arrival in the ED she met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis (WBC 26.1) and tachycardia (105) with no hypotension.
She had a CT-A abdomen showed no evidence of active extravasation but showed multiple peritoneal and omental implants, ascietes, a right iliac [**Last Name (LF) 86508**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] occluded left common femoral artery (with patent nearby collaterals), a stable right renal infarct and a narrowed celiac oriigin as well as a left atrial filling defect which was not present on prior CTA and was felt to be consistent with a clot.
Likely source was felt to be possible UTI (given mildly positive UA - culture was ultimattely negative) versus cellulitis or other soft tissue infection surrounding G-tube.
She was noted to be thrombocytopenic secondary to DIC versus HIT (had recent heparin on last admission) given falling platelets which had fallen from 354 on [**12-30**] to 63 on [**1-8**] and a low fibrinogen of 8.5 and already high INR 3.5 given concomitant warfarin therapy.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 3003**] imaging showed occluded L common femoral artery w/ patent nearby collaterals.
Current exam was concerning for right leg clot.
