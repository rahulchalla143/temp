[**2150-11-26**] Chest Xray: Stable chest x-ray examination with small-to-moderate sized right pleural effusion and no superimposed acute process identified.
[**2150-11-27**] Cardiac Catheterization 1.
The LCX had a modest very high OM1, a large OM2, an atrial branch, a large branching OM3, and a large OM4/LPL.
The L-PDA was diffusely diseased, with an eccentric 60-70% stenosis proximally, and provided collaterals to the RV/AM.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 15 mm Hg and LVEDP of 26 mm Hg.
PA pressures were markedly elevated at 68/37 mm Hg, with an associated mean wedge pressure of 28 mm Hg.
Calculated cardiac output and index were 5.1 L/minand 2.8 l/min/m2, respectively, using a measured oxygen consumption of 252 ml O2/min.
SVR was normal at 1161 dyne s/cm5, and PVR was elevated at 314 dyne s/cm5.
Systemic arterial pressures were normal at 120/65 mmHg.
There was a mean gradient of 34 mm Hg across the aortic valve.
The calculated valve area was 0.92 cm2.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
Moderate to severe aortic stenosis, with a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.92cm2.
[**2150-11-30**]: CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT CHEST: Airways are patent up to subsegmental level.
There is tunneled catheter in the right IJ, and subclavian Port-A-Cath, with multiple collaterals at the right shoulder.
CT ABDOMEN: Small hypodensities are seen in the liver, one in the right liver lobe, (2:56), and one in the left liver lobe, (2:52), and possible hypodensity at the porta hepatis, (2:57), too small to characterize.
There is heterogeneous enhancement of the right kidney, new compared to prior contrast-enhanced CT from [**2148**].
CT PELVIS: There is significant streak artifact from bilateral hip prosthesis, limiting the evaluation of the pelvis; however, bilateral lymph nodes following at the iliac vessels, more on the right, with conglomerate of lymph node surrounding the right iliac artery.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen, with a suboptimal evaluation of the pelvis due to streak artifact from bilateral hip prosthesis.
Tunneled catheter in the right IJ, and subclavian Port-A-Cath, with vascular collaterals at the right shoulder.
[**12-7**] Echo The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-8-18**], regional/global left ventricular systolic function is more depressed c/w interim ischemia.
Microbiology: Negative blood and urine cultures Negative Influenza DFA  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 100984**] is a 73 yo man with history of  CHF with EF 35%, DM2, ESRD on HD, follicular ymphoma, AS, and Afib who presented with chest pain and fatigue.
He also had recently had a PET scan in [**10-23**] showing stable disease.
However, on admission, he reported that his lymph nodes were enlarging rapidly.
A CT torso revealed significant worsening of his lymphadenopathy diffusely and he began to complain of back pain thought to be related to retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Lymph node biopsy was not able to be done prior to his steroid therapy as patient was feeling too unwell to undergo the procedure.
It was later decided not to pursue biopsy as it would not change his lymphoma management.
He received IV dexamethasone, Oncovin ([**12-3**]) and Bendamustine ([**12-3**]), and Rituximab ([**12-4**]).
NSTEMI x2: He was admitted with left-sided chest pain and had had a recent P-MIBI that showed an inferior wall reversible defect.
He was ruled out for MI with cardiac biomarkers and his ECG showed no changes from previous.
Hypotension: He was admitted overnight to the medical ICU during his hospitalization after an episode of hypotension with sytolic blood pressures in the 60's.
Blood cultures were negative.
Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure: His cardiac catheterization revealed severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction as well as moderate to severe aortic stenosis.
He also was dialyzed an extra half-session after cardiac catheterization.
Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for abd discomfort.
