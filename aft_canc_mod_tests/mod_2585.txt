In the ED, patient was placed on NRB and was 100% (no RA sat documented) and he was given Atrovent and Albuterol nebs and his antibiotic coverage was broadened to Vancomycin adn Zosyn.
Labs were remarkable for a Hct of 15.
In the MICU, Zosyn was changed to Cefepime based on culture data that showed that he had fluoroquinolone-resistant Pseudomonas and was thus not treated for previous PNA.
He was transfused a total of 4 [**Location **] and Hct has remained stable.

ECG [**4-12**]: Resting sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2161-4-10**] heart rate is faster.
Clinical correlation is suggested  ECG [**4-13**]: Sinus tachycardia Inferior infarct - age undetermined Poor R wave progression Nonspecific T wave changes Low limb lead voltages Since previous tracing of [**2161-4-12**], T wave flattening noted  ECG [**4-15**]: Possible atrial flutter with 2:1 block Nonspecific ST-T wave changes Low QRS voltages in limb leads Since previous tracing of the same date, atrial flutter, ST changes more pronounced   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is a 60 year old man with metastatic NSCLC, COPD, and CHF, here with worsening dyspnea.
ECG showed likely atrial flutter.
