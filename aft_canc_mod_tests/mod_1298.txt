Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy intubation   History of Present Illness: HPI: 76 yo M with Afib, pacer, CAD s/p CABG, Ischemic CHF EF <40% w/2+MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 34514**] dx RUL mass admitted to MICU after failing extubation from an outpatient bronchoscopy.
On [**2179-1-26**], the patient had an elective bronchoscopy and biopsy of the lung mass by interventional pulmonolgy.
TTE was repeated [**2179-1-26**] w/ EF<25% which is significantly decreased from [**2179-1-7**].

[**2179-1-26**] Trans-Thoraci Echocardiogram Ejection Fraction <25% 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2179-1-7**], left ventricular systolic function has deteriorated.
Head CT: There is stable widening of the extra-axial spaces, prominence in the sulci and ventricles, consistent with age-related involutional changes.
Echo showed new global HK and depression in EF <20%, and this was felt potentially from stunning and demand ischemia.
# Lung Mass: Bronchoscopic biopsy showed squamous cell lung cancer.
He was instructed to discuss with his PCP if he should see a CT surgeon for evaluation if this might be a possibility.
This was then changed to Toprol and HR and BP was in good range.
He underwent a head CT to rule out metastases, and when no mets were seen, he was restarted on coumadin at his previous dose.
Outpatient c-scope needed .
