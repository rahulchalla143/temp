The patient was evaluated and had a positive exercise ETT MIBI, went for catheterization on [**2164-5-30**] with left main 50% ostial lesion, left circumflex 60-70% lesion, RCA with fractured stenosis 80%, 80% ostial lesion, 1+ MR, EF 46%.
She was started on oxygen and Lasix with some improvement, and EKG at that time showed new onset AFib.
Her enzymes were negative.
An echocardiogram on the 29th showed no focal wall motion abnormalities, moderate pericardial effusion, no tamponade.
Due to the echocardiogram findings of a pericardial effusion, Heparin drip which had been started on admission was discontinued, and diuresis was held.
A repeat echocardiogram on [**8-16**] showed an increasing effusion at this time, it was felt now to be moderate to large size.
A CTA was ordered to rule out pulmonary embolus, however, the CT was held in light of the patient's enlarging effusion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her vitals on admission to the CCU, her temperature was 98.4, her blood pressure was 108/60, heart rate was 88, respiratory rate 20, and her O2 sats were 98% on 4 liters.
Her jugular venous pressure was about 15 cm.
She had 2+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally.
Thyroid function tests were sent and were pending.
An ABG showed a pH of 7.45, pCO2 of 40, pO2 of 82 on 4 liters O2 nasal cannula.
A chest x-ray on the 30th showed that the heart was within normal limits.
Slight interval increase of the bilateral pleural effusions, her left hemidiaphragm was not well visualized which is consistent with effusion or left lower lobe collapse or consolidation.
The echocardiogram results were as previously noted.
CCU COURSE:  A pericardial drain was placed 250 cc of blood were drained initially.
The pericardial pressure was 20 mm Hg upon entering and three after the drain was placed.
Her rate fell to 100 to 110, but her heart rate then increased again.
Diltiazem drip was started at 5 mg and her heart rate came down to 100, however, her systolic blood pressure fell to 80, so the diltiazem drip was held, a 250 cc bolus was given, and the patient's systolic blood pressure increased appropriately, and the diltiazem drip was restarted.
Her Synthroid was increased, this was felt to be consistent with hypothyroidism and her Synthroid was increased to 125 mcg a day.
as she had spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm and her pericardial output from the drain had started to decrease.
On the 4th, a bedside echocardiogram was done, which showed a very small pericardial effusion.
It was decided that the patient would benefit from amiodarone therapy, so pulmonary function tests were ordered, which the results were FVC was 54% of predicted, her FEV1 was 60% of predicted.
Her FEV1:FVC ratio was 49%.
Her FRC was 75% of predicted.
Her blood pressure remained stable.
For the V-tach, the patient was to receive a Holter monitor and [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor.
EP was consulted, and they felt that the amiodarone load should be continued and the beta blocker should be increased to a goal resting heart rate of 60 as tolerated by her blood pressure and bradycardia.
Urinalysis suggested a possible UTI.
She should have her INR checked on [**8-23**] by the VNA Services.
