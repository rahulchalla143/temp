Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 112418**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] were admitted to the hosptial because you had fevers while your blood counts were very low (neutropenic fever).
You were treated with IV antibiotics and for a time the infection had caused your blood pressure to be low which temporarily injured your kidneys so you were transferred to the ICU, and this has all since resolved after your counts returned to [**Location 213**].
