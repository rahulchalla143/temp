Chest tube was eventually d/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion.
On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion.
IP and CT surgery were consulted, and decided at that time to undergo VATs due to the possibility of hemothorax.
VATs was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy, pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u plt, 4u plasma, 1u Cryoprecipitate and then taken to the TICU.
Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci.
A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods.
Pt noted to be hypotensive with systolic BP to 78.
However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s.
Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s.
On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Chimerism studies revealed that she was approximately 99% donor.
Physical Exam: On admission Vitals: T 97.2 BP 123/85 HR 136 AF, 99% CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 0.40, PEEP 5 Gen: cachectic, ill appearing, able to follow commands, [**Year (4 digits) 4459**]: Dry mucus membranes, JVP not elevated.
Able to wiggle toes slightly in bilateral lower extremities   Pertinent Results: [**12-31**] - CT chest - IMPRESSION: Increase of right-sided pleural effusion and subsequent atelectasis.
[**1-4**]- EKG - Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2132-1-3**] no major change.
[**1-6**] Echo - IMPRESSION: No endocarditis or abscess seen.
[**1-8**] - hepatic ultrasound - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**1-10**] - portable chest x-ray - right apical pneumothorax now showing signs of tension pneumothorax with shifting of the mediastinum .
[**2132-2-9**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-7**], there is a small residual apical pneumothorax.
The CT perfusion study supports the presence of ischemia.
If there is a suspicion for a paradoxical embolism, a follow-up study by laboratory son[**Name (NI) 16272**] with agitated saline contrast is suggested.
[**2132-2-10**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Progression of extensive multifocal infarctions with dramatic increase in cerebral edema.
Concern for fungal infection in he setting of her LFTs prompted an MRI of the abdomen which showed no fungal infection.
A stat CXR was ordered due to concern of worsening PTX given the patient reported tachypnea (this CXR was read as not changed from prior).
A CTA of the head was obtained that ultimately showed gas within the intracranial venous sinuses and cortical veins, the right internal jugular vein just above the venous catheter entry site, and the right internal carotid artery.
The CT perfusion study also showed extensive multifocal cerebral edema and enhancement.
After confirmation in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] that the patient had stopped seizing, an MRI and MRV were also obtained.
Due to concern of tonsillar herniation she was rushed for a CT head.
The CT of the head showed extensive multifocal infarctions with dramatic increase in cerebral edema, new herniation of the cerebellar tonsils, and leftward subfalcine herniation.
