Last chemotherapy treatment was [**2167-1-7**] which was cycle 1 of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol + avastin.
He underwent CTA which showed bilateral PEs with a post-obstructive PNA.
The CT also showed a small intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the lung but IP felt it was small and was okay with starting heparin.
On the floor, initial PTT was 48 at 8PM and he received a 1300 unit bolus.
He underwent CXR [**12-14**] and CT scan on [**2166-12-18**] revealed extensive new thoracic adenopathy centered at the right hilus involving both adjacent and remote nodal stations in the mediastinum with atelectasis, consolidation, and possible mass involving most of the right upper lobe, particularly the anterior segment.
An endobronchial core biopsy of the right upper lobe mass revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
A transbronchial needle aspiration of 4L, level 7, and 4R lymph nodes revealed no suspicious cells.
A PET scan on [**2166-12-24**] revealed confluent FDG uptake surrounding the right upper lobe bronchus and right main stem bronchus, felt to be related to an infiltrating mass versus post-bronchoscopy change (SUV max 14.1).
Additional involvement includes a left adrenal nodule, a right mandibular lesion, a distal sternal lesion, the left sacral body, a lytic lesion in the left femoral head, the right lesser trochanter, and destructive lesions of the T10 and L1 vertebral bodies, which demonstrated possible spinal canal extension.
An MRI of the brain demonstrated no evidence of brain lesions.

He was initially continued on heparin gtt for b/l PE seen on CTA.
Pt continued to have tachycardia and fatigue and so a repeat CTA was done to evaluate for PE on week 4 of hospitalization.
Pt reevaluated for postobstructive pna later in his hospital course [**1-6**] FUO and recieved CT chest followed by repeat bronch.
Pt was evaluated for recurrent pneumonia with both CT chest (which could not exclude pna) and bronch (which did not show any evidence for pneumonia.)
CT chest did show ggo which could be consistent with fungal pna, COP as well as many other etiologies.
UA and UCx unremarkable and multiple blood cultures were unrevealing.
Infection of clot thought to be unlikely given negative blood cultures.
*****Pt will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] and Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] and will have repeat CT chest in several weeks.
Seemed to improve after last chemo dose.
Hep serologies neg in [**2152**].
# sinus tachycardia: Felt to likely be [**1-6**] PEs as bedside echo shows evidence of elevated RH pressures without RV dilation.
Pt had repeat CTA chest which was pending at the time of discharge (but family feels they do not want anticoagulation).
GI consulted and felt that given hemoptysis, he is a high risk candidate for an upper endoscopy at this time.
*** Could consider EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] for further evaluation as outpt if this is within goals of care.
Repeat UA with 1 RBC prior to discharge.
Pt transfused for goal hct >24.
