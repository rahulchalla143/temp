, though a CXR was negative for fracture.
His DOE progressed and he developed profound fatigue, along with nightsweats and fevers.
Initial vital signs were T98.4 P85 BP129/98 and 97% on RA.
Blood work demonstrated a hematocrit of 25.7 (baseline Hct 45), a new thrombocytopenia to 101, and a WBC of 8.7 with abnormal myeloid cells.
He also had a Cr of 2.2 (baseline 0.8) and was noted to have a new murmur on exam.
He was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for further management, but on the floor he was ill-appearing and further work-up demonstrated a Ca of 17.7 and Uric Acid of 12.9.
His Cr rose to 3.6, but he continued to produce urine.
A CT torso demonstrated diffuse lucencies in the bone without associated lymphadenopathy consistent with multiple myeloma, and his SPEP demonstrated a monocloncal IgG kappa spike of 15% of total protein with normal viscosity.
Over the course of his ICU stay, his serum Ca trended down to 13.7, but his serum phosphate & uric acid continued to climb.
His O2 requirement also continued to rise and a CXR on [**4-17**] suggested a right middle lobe pneumonia so he was started on Ceftriaxone & Azithromycin for CAP.
At the time of transfer, his vital signs were: T 97.9 P84 BP 120/67 R 20's O2Sat 95% on 5L, I 4,618cc O 7,090cc.
He was quickly switched back to 6L, sat'ing 95-96% with a RR of 36.
Past Medical History: Asthma Costrochondritis Lower back pain w/ L3-L4 lateral disc protrusion Obesity Nephrolithiasis H/O atypical chest pain Rectal bleeding Hyperlipidemia Sleep apnea, OSA 11cm H20 s/p rib fractures x 1, [**2-/2136**] Depression   Social History: Patient lives in [**Location 745**] with his wife & works on faculty at [**University/College 25932**].
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
A mid-cavitary and outflow tract gradient is identified without dynamic resting LVOT obstruction (high output state).
CT SCAN: FINDINGS: A limited examination of the porta hepatis and peripancreatic region was performed.
A multiphase CT could be performed for better characterization when the patient is better able to tolerate contrast.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN: CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: No pathologically enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes are observed.
Small precarinal and subcarinal lymph nodes measure up to 8 mm in short axis which does not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Non-contrast evaluation of the kidneys reveals a 7-mm nonobstructing right interpolar stone.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.
However, the torso CT obtained the same day shows innumerable small lytic foci which are consistent with myeloma.
MRI Lumbar spine [**2136-6-10**]:  1.
Disc desiccation and posterior diffuse disc bulge is also noted at L5/S1, apparently contacting the S1 nerve root on the right.
MRI THIGH [**2136-6-10**]:  Diffuse, marrow infiltration in the pelvis and femurs, consistent with known multiple myeloma.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT pelvis ORTHO w/out contrast [**2136-6-12**]:  1) Innumerable lytic areas throughout the bones of the pelvic girdle and, to a lesser extent, in the proximal femurs.

He was vigourously hydrated with intravenous fluids and given lasix to maintain a urine output of over 200cc/hr.
His calcium level dropped with this regimen and at time of discharge from the ICU was low-normal.
Vitamin D levels were low, PTH low, TSH WNL.
He was transferred to the BMT floor and his serum Ca remained in a low to low-normal range.
# Multiple Myeloma/ Plasma cell leukemia: Patient with M-protein in both urine & serum identified as IgG kappa as well as end-organ damage manifested as ARF and anemia, diffuse lytic lesions on CT and hypercalcemia suggested a diagnosis multiple myeloma.
Bone marrow biopsy results were positive for myeloma.
Skeletal survey was not significant for lucencies, although these were appreciated on his CT chest.
He ultimately completed 8 days of Velcade, but peripheral blood demonstrated an increasing number of plasma cells (peak 38% plasma cells).
Tumor lysis labs were monitored [**Hospital1 **] during treatment, and whiel LDH and Uric acid where transiently elevated, the patient never required Rasburicase treatment.
MRI of thorasic and lumbar spine as well as left hip was performed and revealed significant disk disease and hyperdensity at femoral neck region which could represent an area more suscpetible to pathological fracture.
In order to evealuate further for pathologic fracture, ORTHO CT of the pevis without contrast was performed and did not reveal any pathologic fractures, however revealed areas of possible cortical interruption in right iliac region and femoral neck, which may be susceptible to pathologic fracture.
# Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: Early in the course of his hospitalization, the patient developed an increasing O2 requirement in the setting of known asthma, aggressive fluid therapy, and a new right middle lobe pneumonia with pulmonary edema on CXR and CT chest.
In the setting of an elevated BNP, aggressive fluid hydration, and signs of overload on CXR, he underwent a repeated echocardiograms that demonstrated acute worsening of the patient's pulmonary artery hypertension with a peak pressure of 60mm Hg.
He was also continued on supplemental O2 with NC/face tent until his oxygen was weaned entirely and he was able to maintain his oxygen saturation on room air.
The patient's outpatient CPAP machine was adjusted appropriately at the time of discharge.
His uric acid levels downtrended following administration of rasburicase and aggressive hydration to WNL, at which time allopurinol was d/ced.
His uric acid level normalized, but Allopurinol was restarted during his Cytoxan/Doxorubicin therapy.
As there was no evidence of TLS and LDH / Uric Acid trended down, Allopurinol was discontinued prior to discharge.
His urine output remained excellent throughout hospitalization and his Cr following hydration began to downtrend.
As his bone marrow biopsy demonstrated significant marrow infiltration, it was felt likely that this was due to ineffective production rather than destruction.
The patient's hematocrit and platelet counts were monitored and he was transfused as needed throughout admission.
