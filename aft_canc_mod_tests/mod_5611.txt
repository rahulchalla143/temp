Admission Date:  [**2112-2-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-2-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2033-2-26**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CV MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old female, with a past medical history significant for metastatic breast carcinoma with stable metastases to the lung, as demonstrated on a CT scan in [**11/2111**], who presents with a 1-month history of progressive dyspnea on exertion.
For work-up of this, her primary care provider had the patient undergo a cardiac stress test on [**2112-2-2**] which was negative for reversible perfusion defects.
She also did have an echocardiogram done on [**2112-2-4**], which showed a moderate pericardial effusion which had increased slightly since her previous echo.
Pericardial effusion status post echo [**2112-2-4**], which showed moderate pericardial effusion, no tamponade physiology, ejection fraction of 60%, mild MR, moderate TR.
History of metastatic breast cancer, status post CT in [**2111-11-23**] which showed stable lung metastases, and at that time stable pericardial effusion.
VITALS ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.6, blood pressure 127/56, pulse 70, respiratory rate 22, satting 100% on 2 liters.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 4.4, hematocrit 33.7, platelets 198.
She had a UA which was negative.
Chest x-ray showed right heart border was obscured with possible infiltrate.
EKG was irregular with poor R wave progression, which was new.
However, cytology was still pending.
Her systolic function was normal with an LV-EF of 55%.
This echo was performed after her pericardial drain was pulled.
A total of approximately 460 cc of pericardial fluid was collected in the drain post her pericardiocentesis for a total of approximately 900 cc of straw-colored fluid removed.
The patient also had a temperature to 101.
This was most likely attributable to her right infiltrate which was seen on her admission chest x-ray, and she was started on Levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia.
The patient did not spike any further fevers after that initial temperature of 101.
She had serial x-rays which showed worsening pulmonary congestion.
On the day of discharge, her oxygen saturation improved.
She did have improved exam and oxygen saturation on the day of discharge.
The patient will also receive an echocardiogram in 1 month's time to reevaluate for pericardial effusion.
