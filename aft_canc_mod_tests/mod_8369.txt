However, when the patient's condition permit, gadolinium-enhanced MRI would help for further assessment.
Enhanced imaging would help for further assessment.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
Medications, infection, metabolic disturbances, and anoxia are among the most common causes but there are others.
Prior cultures significant for MDR pseudomonas sensitive to Cipro from sputum [**6-10**] and MDR E coli sensitive (ESBL) to Meropenem from sputum [**6-9**].
Also, VRE from cath tip on [**6-21**], started on Daptomycin.
Tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem were  planned for 14 day course per infectious disease consultants recommendations.
Also daptomycin was begun as a removed catheter tip grew VRE; however, daptomycin was discontinued due to negative blood cx on [**6-23**] for VRE.
# ARF: Her baseline creatinine 0.8-1.0.
During her last admission creatinine elevation believed to be secondary to Tobramycin and antibiotic discontinued at that time.
Cr 1.4 prior to discharge.
Her renal function improved during her ICU stay and her creatinine at discharge was 2.4 (3.3 on admission.
ABG showed respiratory alkalosis with concomitant metabolic acidosis, which could be primary non-gap acidosis due renal failure or respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis due to sepsis with baseline chronic respiratory alkalosis due to increased central drive (bicarbonate less than expected for acute, but bicarbonate values perhaps consistent with chronic pC02 drop).
# Anemia:  The patient required multiple blood transfusions this admission to keep her hematocrit above a tranfusion goal that ranged from 21-25.
Thigh bleeding was noted on exam in the region of a femoral line, which was removed secondary to question of possible art stick initially.
Her hematocrit was 22.0 upon discharge and stable.
A CT head showed no interval change, old R frontal stroke.
Urine cultures were negative.
Sputum cultures grew culture PSEUDOMONAS, SENSITIVE to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, resistant to meropenum.
A catheter tip grew VRE although blood cultures were negative.
More recent blood cultures are currently pending but show no growth to date.
Tachycardia was likely secondary to hypotension and a PE was unlikely as oxygenating well.
# Pancytopenia: She has a h/o MDS seen on bone marrow biopsy with borderline transformation to AML.
Counts were as low as 1.0 but have increased again, WBC up to 4.0 today, on neupogen.
Neuro exam cannot be assessed secondary to patient's clincial status.
GCS currently 9(eyes open, withdraws/localizes to pain, nonverbal).
CT head and MRI during this admission showed no new CVA.
# Asthma: No evidence of obstruction on ABG in ED.
