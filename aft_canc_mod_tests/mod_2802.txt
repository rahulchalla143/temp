Bbronchoscopy - endoluminal laser therapy 2.
COPD, intubated x2 for exacerbations, FEV1 = 1.24 (36%) in [**7-1**]; 1L home oxygen at night 3.
Physical Exam: Vitals T afebrile  BP 121/86  P 114  RR 20  O2Sat 96% RA Gen: pleasant, middle aged man, in NAD, speaking in full sentences on RA HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, adentulous, OP clear CV: tachycardic, regular, no mrg Lungs: decreased BS on L Abd: soft, NTND, +BS Ext: w/wp, no edema Neuro: aox3, CN 2-12 grossly intact, strength 5/5, sensation grossly intact  Pertinent Results: From [**Hospital1 59561**]: [WBC 10, HCT 30, PLT 272 INR 1.6 PTT 27.6 Sputum Cx [**12-31**]: normal flora  Chest CT ([**12-31**]): Soft tissue mass abutting the hilum [left side] is not significantly changed.
EKG ([**2136-1-2**]): Sinus tachy (112), AVL and V2 inversions; no old EKGs for comparison ------------  Pertinent studies in hospital:  [**2136-1-3**]: Left bronchial artery embolization.
The patient was placed supine on the angiography table, and the skin of the right groin was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
A .035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was then advanced into the abdominal aorta.
A selective arteriogram of the right bronchial artery was performed, further demonstrating the collateralization extending to the left bronchial arterial supply, and terminating in tumor vasculature.
Selective arteriography showed the collateral stem directed inferiorly and supplying predominantly the left bed of the bronchial artery.
Successful embolization with 500 to 700 micron embospheres of the left bronchial artery via the right bronchial arterial trunk.
[**2136-1-5**] ECHO  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 70% to 80% (nl >=55%) TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *>= 60 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)  INTERPRETATION:  LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
He had a bronchoscopy on [**2136-1-3**] that showed bleeding from the left lower lobe and no endobronchial lesion.
His ABG was 7.18/70/261.
His EKG showed tachycardia, query MAT vs afib.
He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2136-1-5**] that showed obstruction of the left lower lobe by old bloody secretions, 50% narrowing of superior LLL secondary to extrinsic compression, extrinsic compression of the lingular segment, patent left lower lobe bronchus.
He had a echo that showed a pericardial effusion, but no evidence of tamponade.
Anemia: His hematocrit remained stable in the low 30's.
