FLUID CULTURE AND GRAM STAIN REQUESTED BY FAX       FROM [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4912**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ON [**2184-8-18**] AT 08:36AM.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2184-8-18**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):  GRAM STAIN (Final [**2184-8-4**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2184-8-7**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2184-8-10**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
[**8-3**] EKG Irregular rhythm may be "fine" atrial fibrillation but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
[**8-5**] ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
[**8-10**] CXR IMPRESSION: Stable moderately large pleural effusions, worse on the right side.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided pressures with mean RA pressure of 18 mmHg and mean PCW pressure of 30 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension, with mean PA pressure of 55 mmHg.
There was moderate to severe systemic hypertension, with SBP of 193 mmHg.
[**8-17**] CXR FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to thoracic surgery on [**2184-8-2**] for evaluation and treatment of right pleural effusion.
On admission, patient was short of breath but with sats 90-95% on 2LNC.
CXR showed large right pleural effusion and interventional pulmonology was consulted for thoracentesis.
Patient's INR on admission was 3.2 (on coumadin for afib) which was reversed overnight with 4U FFP and lasix.
On AM of [**2184-8-3**], patient's dyspnea worsened and she desaturated to high 88-90 on 6LNC with BP of 200/130.
Patient was given sublingual nitro with BP returning to 140/90.
EKG was performed revealing no ST-T changes and a left bundle branch block, present on previous EKG from [**Hospital1 1562**].
Stat CXR was done with stable effusion and no evidence of pulmonary edema.
BNP was 2357.
Lung exam demonstrated bilateral wheezes but no crackles.
In TICU, patient was started on BIPAP and briefly on nitro drip for SBP in 180s.
Her dyspnea and hypertension responded well to BIPAP with O2 sats >95% on 4LNC.
Preliminary results showed fluid c/w transudate, although chylothorax cannot be ruled out since patient had been NPO.
Her pleural effusion on CXR were slightly large but stable.
Pulmonology did not think there was a pulmonary pathology based on their evaluation and CT Chest.
RHC showed elevated right and left heart filling pressure with moderate pulmonary hypertension and severe systemic hypertension.
INR was therapeutic on [**2184-8-13**].
RHC showed elevated right and left heart filling pressure with moderate pulmonary hypertension.Pleural effusions , with right greater than left both of which have been tapped on this admission and drained fluid was transudative without high triglycerides.
3.5L in 2 days.Her weight on discharge was 62.1 Kg decreased from 66.5Kg on [**8-14**].
Discontinued IV lasix  drip ( measured systolic was around 100 on arms and 140-180 on thigh readings, drip was on from 9/11PM to 9/13AM).Transitioned to oral lasix 60mg [**Hospital1 **] with net fluid goal of even to net negative 500cc a day with 1500cc/day fluid restriction.
IP drained on [**8-17**] PM her right pleural effusion and removed around 1000cc and sent for extensive lab workup of the removed pleural fluid.F/u on the post drain chest X ray and pleural labs.
Ambulatory oxygen saturation-84-94% on RA, did not feel SOB .Ordered CXR [**8-17**]-The previously identified moderate amount of right-sided pleural effusion has decreased markedly following the successfully performed thoracocentesis.
RHC showed severe systemic hypertension.
Popliteal blood pressures with dopplers measured while lying were greater than 120s-150s.
Renal ultrasound to assess for renal artery stenosis given diffuse calcified arteries on CT chest study-results included: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for renal artery stenosis, Cortical thinning with minimally elevated resistive indices, Right pleural effusion.
Creatine @ baseline at 1.7-1.9.Renal ultrasound given diffuse calcified arteries on CT chest-results included: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for renal artery stenosis, Cortical thinning with minimally elevated resistive indices, Right pleural effusion.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Was in sinus rhythm with rates in 60s-70s and episode of atrial fibrilliation for 15 minutes up to 120's, which was asymptomatic on [**8-16**].
She transitioned spontaneously back into 60-90 normal sinus rhythm.No contraindication to beta blockers given  systolic blood pressures ranging from 130-170's.Start metoprolol tartrate 12.5mgBID for rate control ([**8-16**]), given some bradycardic episodes on [**9-14**] the patient will be d/c'd on 12.5mg/daily of metoprolol succinate.Restarted Coumadin on [**8-17**] with one time dose of 5mg/daily and standing on 3mg Coumadin on [**8-18**] to reach therapeutic range of [**1-7**].
# DM2: Will follow finger sticks.Continued insulin sliding scale.
Patient was in NSR at the time of discharge  Medications on Admission: digoxin - 0.125 mg thyroxine - 88 mcg Lasix - 40 mg QD Glipizide - 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] coumadin - 2.5 mg Daily lipitor - 40 mg QD ASA - 81 mg iron - 65 mg prilosec - 20 mg Dexamethasone and revlimid-> was tried for MM but she could not tolerated it.
