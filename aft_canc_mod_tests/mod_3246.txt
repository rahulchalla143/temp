She transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

[**2138-3-17**] Functional MR [**Last Name (Titles) 47159**] mass lesion centered in the lower aspect of the right frontal lobe with vasogenic edema extending in the parietal region, apparently unchanged since the prior head CT dated [**2138-3-13**].

Residual rim enhancement at the resection margin may represent postoperative change or residual tumor and interval followup with perfusion imaging is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted to the hospital and neuro exam monitored.
She had malignancy work up including CT torso which was negative for primary malignancy.
She underwent CTA of the head to determine the vascular supply of this right parietal lesion to help with surgical planning.
The fMRI showed that the areas of the cheek/tongue, and left sided motor were near the area of the tumor.
She had a post-op head CT which showed no acute hemorrhage and expected post-op changes.
Around 4am she was noted to be plegia with her LUE and a STAT head CT was obtained which showed no change.
She had a post-operative MRI of the brain which showed rim enhancement and expected post operative changes as well as vasogenic edema.
