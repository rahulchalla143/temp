HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68 year old male with a history of congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction of 30 to 40%, status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft, likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a [**2149-5-25**] admission for pansensitive Streptococcus pneumococcal pneumonia who presented yesterday with shortness of breath for two days, a cough productive of white sputum, chills, and increased dyspnea on exertion.
Congestive heart failure, [**2149-5-25**] ejection fraction of 30 to 40% with moderate mitral regurgitation, [**2146**] ejection fraction of less than 20%; 4.
Anteroapical aneurysm; 5.
Hodgkin's disease, Stage 4B with bone marrow infiltration in [**2143**], underwent six cycles of ABVD, [**2144**] torso computerized tomography scan and gallium scan were negative as were bone marrow biopsy times two; 12.
Mild chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.3; 15.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, heartrate 85, blood pressure 111/66, oxygen saturation 92 to 96% on 5 liters by face mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs revealed sodium 136, hemolyzed potassium 6.5, repeated 6.0, chloride 98, bicarbonate 25, BUN 33, creatinine 2.0, glucose 108.
White blood cell count 16.3, hematocrit 43.8, platelets 457, MCV 78, RDW 15.5.
Differential:  Neutrophils 59, bands 35, lymphocytes 3, atypicals 2, PT 29.8, PTT 47.7, INR 5.9.
Cardiac enzymes, CK 110, CK MB 3, troponin I 3.2.
Chest x-ray:  Right middle lobe infiltrate, cardiomegaly.
This brought his blood pressure in to the 90s, at which time the patient was removed.
Pulmonary - Because the patient was presumed to have community-acquired pneumonia, by clinical presentation and chest x-ray he was started on Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
6 hours and this appeared to help with his oxygen saturation and dyspnea.
His oxygen requirement slowly improved while in-house, however, his saturations frequently dropped while ambulating.
His systolic blood pressure improved to the 100s, subsequently.
His Cozaar and Carvedilol were held at that time but returned gradually over the next few days as his pressures continued to rise to an appropriate level.
His blood pressure was monitored for the remainder of his inpatient stay and remains approximately in the 1-teens/70s.
His initial troponin I was 3.2 and the following troponin I was 1.7.
Infectious disease - The Gram stain of the patient's sputum showed multiple organisms consistent with oral pharyngeal Flora.
The sputum culture grew out oropharyngeal organisms as well as moderate coagulase positive Staphylococcus growth.
Heme - As the patient's INR and PT were initially elevated, his Coumadin was held until the INR began to drop.
As the INR began to normalize, the Coumadin was slowly returned.
Of note, his PTT was elevated as were his fibrinogen and haptoglobin.
His FDT and D-dimer were also mildly elevated.
Oncology - Because the patient's PTT remained elevated without explanation while in-house and because he had not received regular follow up after his Hodgkin's disease an oncology consultation was obtained.
He should undergo a surveillance computerized tomography scan as well as a possible gallium scan, PET scan and/or bone marrow biopsy.
His creatinine decreased to 1.7 after the 500 cc bolus and continued to trend down thereafter.
BUN and creatinine were monitored throughout the remainder of the stay.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet as tolerated.
Prophylaxis - The patient was kept on Protonix.
DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged home to [**Hospital 3773**] Rehabilitation once he was able to ambulate without dropping his saturations into the 80s.
