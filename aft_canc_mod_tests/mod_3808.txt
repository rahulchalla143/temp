male diabetic vasculopath with [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Tear in [**5-26**], known unrevascularized 3VD, Ischemic CM with EF 30%, CKD presents with hematemesis, acute renal failure and chest pain.
The patient was thought to be having a massive UGIB leading which lead to an NSTEMI in the setting of a hct of 23.
He required 4 U PRBC initially (for hct nadir=23), and hct remained stable after this.
An EGD was eventually performed and a MW tear was identified and appeared to have recently bleed.
Troponin T peaked at 5.95 while CK was >800, MBI>17.
After blood transfusions, chest pain resolved.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that he warranted a CT surgery evaluation (given has known 3VD that was not amenable to percutaneous intervention in the past) who felt he was not a good candidate at this time for surgical revascularization.
Cardiology felt that a cath was not warrented given the patients lack of anginal symptoms (when hct normal).
Creatinine improved slightly after PRBC, and FeNA was >1.
Renal insufficiency likely in setting of poor forward flow and blood loss.
4) Ischemic Cardiomyopathy with EF 30%, global HK.
The TTE was unchanged since previous study in [**5-26**].
HIT was checked (negative) and platelets were followed daily.
An outpatient workup should be considered.
