MICRO: Bl cx - no growth to date Urine legionella - negative Influenza DFA - negative Sputum culture ([**2171-6-1**]):       STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
Urine culture ([**2171-6-1**]): YEAST.
CARDIOLOGY: TTE ([**5-6**]): Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Port CXR post line - RIJ terminating in appropriate position, no PTX .
Comparison is made with prior study performed [**2171-6-3**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis following administration of 50 mL of Optiray intravenous contrast that was hand injected via the left upper extremity PICC line.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is a moderate right and small left pleural effusion, with underlying atelectasis.
CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The uterus is not identified.
Alternatively, diagnostic paracentesis could be performed 3.
Compression deformities of T9, T11 and L2 with resultant narrowing of the spinal canal, significantly at T9 and T11.
Revised report was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 9:30AM on [**2171-5-28**]  The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

On the floor patient's blood pressure ranged from 92-141/56-87, was re-started on outpatient B-blocker and started on lasix diuresis.
She was afebrile, pulse 97-118, 94-99 on 2 L. At 1830 [**2171-5-8**] patient was found to be tachypneic (RR 40s) and ABG demonstrated CO2 55, pH 7.22 and lactate of 5.1.
A sputum culture from the trach revealed MRSA, however, the trach is likely colonized.
CT scan abdomen showed properly placed GJ tube, ascites and ovarian mass.
Her G-tube was to gravity and J tube clamped.
No aggressive fluid resucitation due to overload on exam and CXR.
When sedation weaned, blood pressure returned to her normal.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] ultimately tolerated Lasix gtt started on [**5-28**] later transition to Q8 boluses, to diurese excess fluid off with a goal of negative 1 liter/day.
Cardiac Failure: EF demonstrated new regional wall abnormality and worsened MR, troponin and CK negative.
EKG no ST elevation.
Held outpatient BB and CCB due to low blood pressure and due to comfort measures at discharge it is not recommended that any of her outpatient medications be restarted.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Osteoporosis: Continued outpatient calcium and vitamin D and due to comfort measures at discharge it is not recommended that any of her outpatient medications be restarted.
