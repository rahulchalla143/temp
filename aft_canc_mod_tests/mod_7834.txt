His initial vitals were T 97.6 P 96 BP 122/54 R 24 and O2 sat 87% on RA.
CXR showed large R pleural effusion and new mild pulmonary edema.
He was placed on a nonrebreather and O2 sat increased to 100%.
His most recent vitals from the MICU at 1700 were 96.8 72 106/48 21 92%/4L.
Of note, the patient has a history of Afib and has been holding his coumadin for a scheduled outpatient pleurex catheter placement on [**2194-9-20**] and has an INR from [**9-18**] of 1.2.
Given the potential risk of complications and the very likely diagnosis of lymphoma, a decision was made to not to perform a lymph node biopsy in the mediastinum.

# HYPOXIA: The patient arrived with dyspnea and O2 sat of 87% on room air.
# CHF Similar to his prior hospitalization on [**9-4**], the patient presented with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (ECHO on [**9-4**] demonstrated preserved systolic function).
He was discharged with a subtherapeutic INR of 1.0 without a bridge given his CHADS2 score of 2. .
# CKD STAGE IV: His creatinine rose from 2.2 upon admission to a peak of 2.4 as a result of aggressive diuresis.
You were admitted with shortness of breath and on physical exam and chest x-ray we found that you had fluid "inside" your lung as well as "around" your lung.
In there, you required oxygen, medication through your vein (lasix or furosemide) to get rid of the fluid as well as a thoracocentesis (drainage of the fluid around your lung).
We recently re-started it and you MUST follow your INR next week and fax the results to your PCP.
* We slightly increased your torsemide to two 20 mg tablets twice a day  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
