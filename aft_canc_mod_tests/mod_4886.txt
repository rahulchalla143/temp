Initial vitals were T 97.4 HR 124 BP 88/53 RR 20 Sat96%RA.
Labs were notable for WBC 15.6 with 79%N.
Lactate 4.5 and normal coagulation profile (patient on lovenox, last received [**7-18**] AM).
CXR was notable for worsened right pleural effusion compared to prior [**2121-7-1**] along with partial lung collapse.
Bedside echo was significant for large pericardial effusion that is new compared to echo in [**2119**] but was present in series of CT chests in [**2120**] with progressive slight increase in size in between.
Vitals on transfer were: Temp: 97.9 ?????
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were: T 99, HR 126, BP 107/74, HR 88, RR 22, Sat 95%RA.
He was transferred to the floor, with vitals of VS T97.6 BP100/60  P111 RR18 Sat 96/2L.
CT revealed a 11.4 x 8.6 cm right kidney enhancing mass with central necrosis and calcification, pulmonary and adrenal metastases and lytic lesions in his right acetabulum and lesser trochanter.
A TTE showed an atrial PFO.
MRI Brain showed multifocal intracranial metastases.
- [**2120-7-24**]: XRT to R hip, 5 treatments - [**2120-8-1**]: Cyberknife to brain mets - [**2120-8-9**]: Laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy with adrenalectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**].
- [**2120-9-2**]: Repeat MRI with new metastatic lesions.
- [**Date range (3) 88900**]: WBXRT - [**Date range (3) 88901**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for syncope and hypotension, found to have a PE as well as RP bleed.
Father-MI at age 76.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-9-13**], pericardail effusion is new.
CXR [**7-18**]: IMPRESSION:  Significant interval enlargement of the right-sided pleural effusion which is now large.
CXR - lateral decub [**7-19**]: FINDINGS:  A right pleural effusion is apparently layering, but given its large size it is difficult to exclude a loculated component.
Lytic skeletal lesion at level of fourth anterolateral right rib is present and has been more fully evaluated on prior CT of [**2121-6-9**] which documented extensive skeletal metastatic disease.
CXR [**7-19**]: IMPRESSION:   1.
CXR [**7-20**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**7-22**]: The left ventricular cavity is small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR [**7-27**]: IMPRESSION:  1) Moderately large right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
This appears new compared with the torso CT from [**2121-6-9**].
If clinically indicated, further characterization with chest CT should be considered, to better assess the relationship of these findings to the pericardium.
Presented with worsening SOB and chest discomfort, found to have worsening large right pleural effusion compared to [**2121-7-1**] and worsening large pericardial effusion, concerning for malignant process.
Differential for pleural effusion included malignant process vs parapneumonic effusion.
Pleural fluid showed Protein 2.9, Glucose 28, LD(LDH): 578, Cholest: 66, Triglyc: 20.
Pigtail drain pulled [**7-26**]; patient was initially scheduled for Pleur-X [**7-28**] which was cancelled given patient and family's evolving wishes and decision to forgoe invasive interventions.
He did not have pulsus paradoxus or kussmaul's sign on exam and TTE did not suggest tamponade.
The following day, repeat echo showed no reaccumulation of fluid and he showed no clinical signs of tamponade, so the pericardial drain was pulled.
# Renal cell carcinona: s/p right nephrectomy, Sutent, Cyberknife, WB-XRT, was on Axitinib for progression on MRI (stopped [**2121-7-15**] for possible contribution to his progressive fatigue).
While undergoing work up of his pericardial effusion, findings on echocardiogram were suggestive of myocardial/epicardial metastases.
# Urine retention: patient reports requiring tamsulosin for good urine output with history of self catheterization intermittently.
