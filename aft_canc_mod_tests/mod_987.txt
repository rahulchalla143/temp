Body, spine CT ruled out trauma, and patient became tremulous and neurlogy was called to evaluate.
2)Liver mass/hepatitis/cirrhosis - Initial CT of abdomen done at SICU for trauma workup showed a small mass in the liver.
AFP was slightly elevated with 9.5, his intial liver enzymes were elevated (GGT 3740), and hepatitis panels were all negative.
MRI of abdomen showed fatty cirrhotic liver and 2.2 cm hepatic hemangioma.
Because of hx of alcohol abuse, he most likely has cirrhosis and hepatitis secondary to alcohol.
During his stay, he was well hydrated with IVF and his liver enzymes came down during the hospital stay (AST 221->127) However, his total bilirubin remained increased (2.2-> 4.1 -> 3.5) but showing no jaundice  Patient is aware and understands the risk of continued drinking.
CT did not show any stones, but he may have passed it already.
Urine studies did not show any cells.
CT showed no fracture or obvious musculoskeletal findings that could explain this pain.
4)Thrombocytopenia - Patient came in with initial platelet count of 69 -> 50.
Platelet count increased from 50-> 104.
However, even 3 days after admission when his withrawl symptom was improving requiring less benzodiazepine, his BP and pulse remained high.
Patient was started on metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] which lowered his BP and heart rate to a normal range.
