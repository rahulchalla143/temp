Scans revealed rectal narrowing and liver lesions by CT scan.
Patient underwent colonoscopy which showed changes consistent with radiation proctitis and subsequently started on steroids.
Despite this therapy symptoms persisted and the patient underwent repeat colonoscopy, which was concerning for rectal narrowing [**3-20**] extrinsic mass.
Eval revealed normal post-void residual but evidence of moderate outflow obstruction.
CT scan revealed bladder wall thickening likely related to radiation injury.
Patient's management at OSH was additionally complicated by renal failure with a Cr bump from 1.1 to 2.7, thought possibly to be [**3-20**] contrast nephropathy from CT on [**3-18**].
WBC trend previous 2 wks at OSH [**10-28**] (18 one one day).
Laryngeal cancer (primary in epiglottis) - neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery (regimen unknown) - radical neck dissection [**2177-5-17**], metastasis to thoracic/L3 regions of spine, sacrum, ribs, R and L pelvis (PET scan - [**2177-11-16**]) - radiation therapy to lumbar and thoracic regions 2.

[**2178-3-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: I see no radiopaque central venous line.
IMPRESSION: AP view of the abdomen shows gaseous distension of the large bowel, but no appreciable small bowel distension.
Dilatation of the transverse colon, probably reflecting partial obstruction by a rectal mass, which is demonstrated as diffuse thickening of the rectum on images performed with rectal contrast opacification of the lumen.
[**2178-3-23**] CT-head w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
This was felt likely due to the bilateral hydronephrosis seen on CT scan.
Plans were made for a diverting colostomy, but the patient was converted to "comfort measures only" status instead.
CT Torso and CT head both showed diffuse osteometastatic disease.
