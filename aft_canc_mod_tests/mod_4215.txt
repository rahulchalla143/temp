No etiology was identified during that admission, but subsequent pulmonary work-up identified new pulmonary HTN.
He was started on 3L NC and his sat rose to 99%.
Exam was notable for clear lungs and mild b/l LE edema.
Labs were notable for a HCT 29 (at baseline), negative troponin, proBNPP 716.
A CT chest PE protocol showed no PE and diffuse osseous metastatic disease.
VS prior to transfer: 99.6 119/84 88 20 93% on 3L NC.

CTA [**8-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**8-8**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
CT torso (high res chest CT): IMPRESSION: 1.
Enlargement of the right and left main pulmonary arteries, consistent with clinical history of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
[**Month/Year (2) **] showed stable LV dysfunction with LVEF 55% c/w CAD and worsened pulmonary HTN (TR gradient = 60mmHg, up from 36mmHg on [**2200-7-2**]).
CTA negative for PE or an infectious process.
High resolution CT negative for lymphangitic tumor spread.
His physiology appeared to be consistent with pulmonary [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease as his PA pressures were elevated without evidence of pulmonary arterial pathology (negative CTA) nor left-sided heart pathology (reassuring [**Last Name (un) **] with regard to LVEF and left-sided valvular function.)
# SIRS: Patient spiking fevers to 101.6 with SBP in the 80s as well as tachypnea, tachycardia, and lactate 2.9.
Chest CT, BCx and U/A are all negative for infection.
# Transaminitis: Has elevated LFTs at baseline but admission ALT 343, AST 198, AP 1058, tbili 1.7 are 3-4 times above his baseline.
Retic count of 3.6 does not suggest profound bone marrow suppression.
