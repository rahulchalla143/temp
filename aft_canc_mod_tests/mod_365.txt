In early summer of [**2115**] she also underwent tilt table testing at [**Hospital6 10443**], which was positive per her report.

Her complaints of dizziness and syncope are consistent with the diagnosis of autonomic disorder (positive tilt-table test from Caritas [**Hospital6 5016**] was requested and exam performed on [**2116-2-19**] revealed "patient was progressively tilted from lying down to 60 degrees.
After 17 minutes of tilt at 60 degrees, her BP dropped to 74/52.
Her BP rose over the next minute from 74/52 to 108/72 and eventually to 131/78".
Patient also developed a rash on the back that was thought to be due to dilantin (which was stopped on [**2116-9-24**]; she had supratherapeutic levels for 2 days.. She was oriented to seek medical support in case the rash does not improve and importantly, if it is on the face.
No seizure or abnormalities on the neurological exam ocurred during admission.
Patient also had an echocardiogram which was a normal study (LVEF >55%).
CT head report ([**2116-9-18**]): 1.
repeat CTA on [**2116-9-24**]: 1.
Brain MRI ([**2116-9-25**]): Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage reidentified with a small amount of subdural hemorrhage noted along the right convexity.
Patient's headache improved over time and no change in the neurological examination occured.
Your brain imaging studies revealed the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
In an exam called angiogram, no aneurysms were found that would explain this hemorrhage and, therefore, no neurosurgical intervention was made necessary.
