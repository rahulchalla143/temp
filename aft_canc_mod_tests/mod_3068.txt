He reports that these symptoms are differnt from his presentation for PE in that that presentation was associated only with chest pressure and no shortness of breath.
In ED, vital signs were 98.8, 140/91, 16, 95% RA initially, to 88% RA at one point.
CXR was found to be normal.
Although there was concern for PE, a CTA was not performed due to Cr of 2.0.

INR on Discharge [**2143-10-16**]: 2.1 .
STUDIES: ======== CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-9-30**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
EKG [**2143-9-30**] Sinus rhythm.
LUNG SCAN  [**2143-10-1**] IMPRESSION: Low likelihood ratio of acute pulmonary embolus.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2143-10-1**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-3-18**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
CARDIAC CATH [**2143-10-2**] COMMENTS: 1.
The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean RA pressure was 15mmHg and RVEDP was 19mmHg).
The pulmonary arterial pressures were significantly elevated measuring 76/31mmHg.
The left sided filling pressures were moderately elevated (mean PCW pressure was 24mmHg and LVEDP was 18mmHg).
The systemic arterial pressures were elevated measuring 153/74mmHg.
The cardiac index was measured at 2.6 l/min/m2  using an assumed cardiac consumption rate.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-10-3**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-30**], there is little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Compared to the most recent chest CT dated [**2143-5-1**] all of these pulmonary emboli are new.
Given that some of these have a nodular appearance, a followup scan when the patient's symptoms resolve in approximately 3-6 months is recommended to ensure resolution and to exclude underlying pulmonary lesions.
CT ABD&PELVIS W/O C COLON TECHNIQUE  [**2143-10-8**] IMPRESSION: 1.
EGD [**2143-10-11**] Mucosa suggestive of short segment Barrett's esophagus Erosions in the antrum Erythema and congestion in the antrum compatible with gastritis Erythema and congestion in the first part of the duodenum compatible with duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 1274**] is a 69 yo male with HTN, DM, Hyperlipidemia, former smoker, and history of recent PE who recently stopped anticoagulation admitted with chest pain and shortness of breath on exertion.
After further workup of her iron deficiency anemia, he was found to have a sigmoid mass that was adenocarcinoma.
He initially underwent V/Q scan (because of elevated Cr) which was low probability for PE.
His echo showed evidence of right heart strain and pulmonary hypertension.
On hospital day 2, given the low probability V/Q scan, he underwent cardiac cath which showed single vessel disease, but did not explain his symptoms.
On hospital day 3, he had a CTA which showed multiple bilateral PEs.
He also was started on coumadin 5 mg daily for a goal INR of 2.0-3.0 per Heme-Onc.
His INR will be followed up by his primary care physician.
He had an exercise MIBI in [**2143-1-31**] showed a mild, reversible defect of the inferior wall, new compared to [**2139-10-2**].
Chest pain/pressure was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
His EKG showed dynamic changes with variable TWI in V1-V3.
Cardiac cath showed [**10-2**] showed 50 % mid LAD lesion that was not intervened upon.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
His lipid panel showed LDL 92, HDL 39, TG 210.
A virtual colonography was completed that showed an ulcerative 3 cm lesion in the sigmoid.
Colonoscopy showed the ulcerative mass and biopsies were taken that later were identified as adenocarcinoma.
His goal INR was deemed to be [**12-29**], and he was offered Lovenox by Heme-Onc.
He was discharged with his INR at 2.1.
During hospitalization, his creatinine peaked at 2.0 after contrast dye loads but decreased to his baseline of 1.7 on discharge.
He will be scheduled with sleep study for possible evaluation of CPAP or BiPAP use in hopes of improving his pulmonary hypertension for his impending surgery for colorectal cancer.
He is to be scheduled for an outpatient echo in [**3-1**] weeks to reevaluate the extent of his pulmonary hypertension.
CTA showed multiple nodules.
To stage colon cancer, it would be ideal to get CT lungs with contrast as outpatient.
A CT chest was not performed with contrast as inpatient due to acute on chronic renal failure.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw Chem 7, PT, PTT, and INR by Friday, [**2143-10-18**] and fax attn: to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7790**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11038**].
Pulmonary emboli 2.
Pulmonary hypertension 4.
You had a cardiac catherization where no intervention was done.
You also had a CT of the lungs which showed that you had multiple clots called pulmonary emboli.
The pathology showed colon cancer.
Additionally, one of your lab tests showed that you had H.pylori, a bacteria that causes gastritis.
It is very important that you take your coumadin and that you get frequent lab draws to make sure your INR is within goal.
You will need to get an outpatient sleep study to optimize your outcomes for surgery in the next 1-2 months.
You will also need a repeat echo in 6 weeks before your visit with the surgeons.
Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 1576**],[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2352**] [**Doctor Last Name 4694**] APG (Primary Care) Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1579**] Date/Time: [**2143-10-24**] 9:50 AM .
Also, you will need to have another echo in 6 weeks.
You should remind Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that you need this for preoperative evaluation as the surgeons requested it.
