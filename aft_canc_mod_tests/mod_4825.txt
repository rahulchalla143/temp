NSTEMI: Pt showed no ischemic EKG changes in the ED but cardiac enzymes were noted to be positive with a CK of 1836, CKMB 230, CKMBI 12.5, troponin 0.06.
?s hematocrit trended down throughout first few days of admission.
Pt was transfused one unit on [**9-14**] and his hematocrit did bump appropriately.
Was not actively bleeding and HCT was stable at time of discharge.
