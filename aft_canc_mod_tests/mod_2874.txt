CT ABDOMEN:  Within the visualized lung bases, there are bilateral pleural effusions with enhancing pleural metastases.
The high- attenuation fluid within the pelvis (likely hemorrhagic) has not appreciably increased in size.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases show interval progression of both parenchymal and pleural-based nodules, consistent with metastatic disease.
Numerous metastases in the liver were much better demonstrated on the recent ultrasound from [**2128-10-25**].
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a small-to-moderate amount of high- density ascites, up to 40 Hounsfield units in the lower pelvis, most consistent with recent hemorrhage, probably related to recent percutaneous drain placement.
Possibly because of the phase of contrast administration, the liver metastases are not as conspicuous as on the recent ultrasound.
Subsequent image shows deployment of an incompletely expanded metallic stent across the stenosis.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
US: CONCLUSION: Large pancreatic/portahepatus mass, which has increased in size compared to the CT of [**2128-5-25**].
More significantly, there has been blossoming of diffuse hepatic metastatic disease with very extensive progression since the CT scan.
