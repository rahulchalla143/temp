Studies: CT L-spine ([**10-19**]): No obvious evidence for discitis/osteomyelitis or epidural collection, though evaluation is limited by CT technique.
CT Chest ([**10-19**]): 1.
CXR ([**10-23**]): Persistent asymmetrical pulmonary opacities, for which differential diagnosis includes asymmetrical pulmonary edema, infection such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] hemorrhage, and drug toxicity.
CT Chest ([**10-28**]): 1.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-11**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is somewhat reduced.
([**11-3**])No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
However, the study is technically suboptimal.
He is on 2L NC for BOOP at home and he was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with a O2 sat of 85% on 2L NC.
At the time, he had wheezing, RR > 40, coughing, agitated, he was hypertensive and tachycardic.
His sat had dropped to 69% with a good pleth on a non-rebreather.
Based on the sensitivities of the GNR, abx were changed to ceftaz.
An echo showed no vegitations but global hypokenesis.
On [**10-22**] GNR found to be steno; Ceftaz was discontinued.
Surveilence cultures remained negative.
A CT with contrast showed a new cluster of peribronchovascular and peribronchiolar nodules, concerning for infection.
Given concern for pulmonary hypertension, a bubble study was done, showing no evedence of cardiac shunt.
** Will likely need outpatient right-heart catheterization ** Follow-up repeat beta-glucan/galactomanan .
An MRI was ordered to assess for change in mental status.
Renal was consulted and felt that the creatinine rise was largely dut to the non-toxic effect of bactrim on creatinine absorbtion.
Renal consult team felt that the increased creatinine was due to the benign effect of bactrim on inhibiting tubular secretion of creatinine that would resolve following discontinuation of treatment.
Urine lytes were unrevealing.
He was transfused to keep Hct > 25 and continued on immunosuppression with cellcept.
A wedge resection of right halux onchocrytptosis was done and cultures were sent.
** Follow wound culture and adjust abx as needed .
HEART FAILURE - An echocardiogram in the ICU was notable for an EF of 40 % which is depressed compared to [**10-11**].
He did not require lasix to maintain volume status and this was held while his creatinine was elevated and there were no exam findings of volume overload.
ASPIRGILLOSIS - He was continued on voriconazole 300 po q12h.
SBP 117-152 in ICU.
BLURRY VISION - Patient had blurry vision on this and previous admission that was associated with early sepsis.
NEUROPATHY - He was continued on neurontin.
