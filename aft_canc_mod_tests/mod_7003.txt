CT head [**1-21**]:Hyperdense regions within the head of the right caudate nucleus and right lentiform nucleus.
A followup MR study may be of help in differentiating between these two entities.
rpt CT head [**1-22**]: 1.
rpt CT head [**1-23**]:  1.
[**1-26**]: attempted MRI Incomplete examination due to lack of patient cooperation.
On her exam, her NIHSS is 17 and she has a dense left sided hemiparesis as well as right gaze deviation, left hemianopia and neglect.
Her imaging shows an occlusion of R MCA near its origin.
Her history, exam and imaging are consistent with acute embolic stroke in R MCA.
The plan at this time is to proceed with tPA infusion and if clinical exam remains unchanged in 30 minutes, then plan is to proceed with angio for IA tPA vs. Merci.
Her CT scans showed hemorrhagic conversion in the Right striatum and white matter.
An MRI was attempted, but she was unable to tolerate this.
CVR: Blood pressure was controlled metoprolol 25mg TID and as needed hydralazine.
She had an transthoracic echocardiogram which showed no ASD or LV thrombus.
A bubble study was not done.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was attempted, however Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] developed methemoglobinemia (level 29) after receiving benzocaine spray.
A transthoracic echo with bubble was later done which showed No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
She had lower extremity doppler studies which were negative for DVT.
Her HCT was stable during her hospitalization.
Her electrolytes were monitored carefully, and repleted as necessary.
She had an XR which showed no evidence of cortical disruptions suggestive of fracture or AC separation.
Pain was treated with tylenol and oxycodone.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: -Stroke (Right PCA+MCA-territory infarction)  Secondary diagnoses: - EtOHism / withdrawal - chronic LBP - chronic mild anemia, possible MDS - methemoglobinemia secondary to benzocaine spray.
You had multiple tests including head CT scans, attempted brain MRI, echocardiograms, and ultrasounds of your legs to determine the cause of your stroke.
Additionally, multiple laboratory tests were sent which are still pending.
Followup Instructions: Provider: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3445**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**] Date/Time:[**2135-3-14**] 1:30  The following tests are pending at the time of discharge: antithrombin 3, factor v leiden, prothrombin gene mutation.
