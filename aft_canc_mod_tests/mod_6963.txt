Pelvic exam was performed without evidence of vaginal or cervical bleeding.
Electrolytes showed new renal failure with BUN/Cr 46/2.3 from 14/0.6 1 month prior.
K was 6.0, bicarb 17.
U/A revealed >50 RBCs, 21-50 WBCs, LE and nitrite negative, and no bacteria.
Bilateral femoral CVLs were attempted but wire could not be passed.
Due to the above-mentioned symptoms, the patient underwent a computer tomography of the chest on [**2184-5-14**] that disclosed a 2.6 cm cavitary lesion in the posterior right upper lobe with additional smaller right-sided pulmonary nodules and extensive right hilar lymphadenopathy with marked narrowing of the hilar airways and vessels.
At that point, further staging imaging was obtained with a computer tomography of the torso on [**2184-5-29**] that disclosed the chest findings as detailed above.
An MRI of head was performed on [**2184-5-29**] and showed multiple areas of enhancement identifying with surrounding edema in both cerebral hemispheres as well as in the posterior fossa.
However, she had no problems with motor strength up to the time of initial MRI when she developed some gait instability and required a cane.
A brain biopsy was performed on [**2184-5-30**].

Doppler ultrasound demonstrates rapid systolic upstrokes, with impaired diastolic flow, and elevated resistive indices.
CXR [**7-8**]: Tip of the new right internal jugular line projects over the low SVC.

The bleeding was from renal mets and was localized to the L kidney based on blood seen coming from the L ureter at cystoscopy.
