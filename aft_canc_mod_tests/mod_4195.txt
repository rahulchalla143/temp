She underwent work up with TSH elevated to 5.6, with normal free T4 0.72, negative  [**Doctor First Name **], negative rapid strep.
She had a mammogram that showed benign microcalcifications, no radiographic evidence of malignancy.
A repeat echocardiogram [**5-26**] showed EF 60%, nl LV thickness and wall motion, normal RV/LA, no valvular dysfunction and no effusion.

Hospital course was complicated by a large abdomino/pelvic hemoperitoneum due to ruptured ovarian cyst vs.  drop metastases.

Imaging: [**2107-3-16**]: CT Torso w/o Contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
Attenuation of the right brachiocephalic/subclavian and left  brachiocephalic veins not as well evaluated on this study due to contrast timing.
Right upper and middle lobe masses appear enlarged compared with the CT torso [**2107-1-17**] with bilateral chest tubes in place and small left pleural effusion.
