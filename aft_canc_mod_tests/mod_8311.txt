He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in early [**2183**] and underwent an attempted Whipple in [**3-/2183**] that was aborted when metastatic disease to the liver was discovered at laparotomy.
A CTA was negative for PE and showed numerous lung and liver lesion and an air-filled strucutre at the anterior border of the liver that could represent gallbladder with pneumobilia, bowel, or a necrotic lesion.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 99.4 134 109/85 22 96%/RA.
JVP 7-8cm.
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds at bases and bibasilar rales, L > R. Otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-distended, TTP in RUQ w/o rebound or guarding, hypoactive bowel sounds, Liver edge palpable 4cm below costal margin GU: no foley Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, trace pitting edema to shins bilaterally, no clubbing, cyanosis Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, gait deferred.

The administered oral contrast passes freely through the stent into the proximal small bowel.
These findings have not significantly changed since the earlier study of [**2183-8-18**] but are better characterized on this study given the abdominal coverage today.
Multiple lung nodules described in prior CT are not clearly visualized in this examination and are below the resolution of this exam.
[**8-18**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY IMPRESSION: 1.
If further evaluation is needed, a CT of the abdomen may be obtained if clinically indicated, noting that the anatomy of the area is not well delineated by this study, or an accompanying ultrasound performed around the same time.
Correlation to prior outside imaging, if any prior abdominal CT is available, may also be helpful.
If more definitive characterization is needed clinically, CT abdomen may be obtained, preferably with intravenous contrast is possible.
His transaminases, alk phos, and TBili were downtrending during his admission.
GI/ERCP evaluated the patient and felt that his symptoms were unlikley to be due to cholangitis or biliary obstruction and felt that an ERCP was unnecessary.
Early imaging in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED suggested the presence of a possible liver abscess.
A CT abdomen/pelvis showed perforated cholecystitis with an adjacent fluid collection that was concerning for abscess.
A gram stain of the fluid showed polymicrobial infection and cultures were pending.
Pending culture results, the proposed antibiotic plan was to obtain repeat imaging upon discharge from [**Hospital1 2436**] to ensure that the fluid collection was being drained adequately, to continue IV antibiotics for 2 weeks (last day of IV abx [**9-2**]), to reimage the abdomen, and then to potentially transition to PO antibiotics for the last two weeks of his 4 week course (ending [**9-16**]).
# Afib with RVR: The patient presented from [**Hospital3 **] in Afib with RVR to the 150s on a diltiazem gtt at 10mg/hr.
His blood sugars were better controlled with this regimen.
We initially felt your symptoms might have been due to a bile duct obstruction or a bile duct infection (cholangitis), but your labs normalized and we did not feel an ERCP was necessary.
We did a CT scan that showed you had a perforated gall bladder that was infected.
We took a sample of the infected fluid and the culture results are pending in the [**Hospital1 18**] microbiology lab.
You should have another imaging study to see if the fluid collection is improving.
Your blood sugars were elevated during your hospitalization.
In this case, please call [**Hospital1 18**] operator ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**]) and ask for [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with the radiology nurse practitioner's office for further instructions.
