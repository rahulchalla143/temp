Found on CT chest to have anterior mediastinal hematoma.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: 138/70 SR 66 HEENT: Unremarkable NECK: Supple, FROM, No carotid bruits LUNGS: Clear to auscultation HEART: RRR, Nl S1-S2, No M/R/G ABD: S/NT/ND/NABS.
CTA of [**2184-12-30**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper abdomen prior to the administration of intravenous contrast.
Axial MDCT images were then obtained from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation after the administration of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray in the arterial phase.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: An anterior mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most recent non-contrast chest CT of [**1-4**], [**2184**], at which time it measured 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.
An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple examinations.
Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.

Normal IVC diameter (<2.1cm) with >55% decrease during respiration (estimated RAP (0-5mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
As he was stable, he was admitted to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit with aggressive blood pressure control.
His CT scan showed a dilated ascending aorta showed no dissection of his aorta however showed a large mediastinal hematoma consistent with a penetrating ulcer which had stopped leaking.
Serial CT scans showed a mild increase in the size of an anterior mediastinal hematoma with no evidence of active extravasation and an unchanged thoracic aortic aneurysm with marked mural irregularity consistent with penetrating ulcers and intramural hematoma.
On [**2185-1-5**], he was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
His hematocrit stabilized.
