RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):       RARE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
His admission sputum culture grew out multidrug resistant pseudomonas, sensitive to amikacin and intermediate for ceftazadine.
He has requested a swallow study and P-M valve, but is not a candidate for it unless he agrees to have his settings changed over to pressure support.
He was discharged with instructions to have his LFTs followed q3days, and restarting cellcept would be considered at follow-up oncology appointment.
His IgG was followed over the course of the admission--it was 705 on [**8-16**], but had dropped to 480 on [**8-25**].
