T cells comprise 72% of lymphoid gated events, express mature lineage antigens, and have a helper-cytotoxic ratio of 1.6.
INTERPRETATION  Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a Kappa restricted CD10 positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
The immunophenotypic profile in concert with the morphologic features of the lymphoma on the bone marrow smear and core biopsy are consistent with Burkitt's lymphoma.
The white blood cell count appears increased.
Differential count shows 24% neutrophils, 1% bands, 2% monocytes, 52% lymphocytes, 17% eosinophils, 2% myelocytes, 2% metamyelocytes.
Differential shows: <1% Blasts, <1% Promyelocytes, <1% Myelocytes, <1% Metamyelocytes, 4.2% Bands/Neutrophils, <!% Plasma cells, 2.6% Lymphocytes, 1.8% Erythroid, 90% medium size blasts with basophilic cytoplasm with numerous vacuoles.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of a core biopsy of paratrabecular bone measuring 2.2 cm.
Low lung volumes  TTE:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CBD 2-mm.
Flow Cytometry ([**1-3**])- Cell marker analysis demonstrates a T cell dominant lymphoid profile and diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Review of corresponding blood smear showed occasional immature-appearing mononuclear cells, morphologically consistent with blasts.
BM Biopsy ([**1-5**])- - NORMOCELLULAR MYELOID DOMINANT MARROW WITH MYELOID LEFT-SHIFT, MEGAKARYOCYTIC HYPERPLASIA  AND ERYTHROID HYPOPLASIA.
Cytogenetics ([**1-5**])- No cytogenetic aberrations were identified in 20 metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
CSF ([**1-15**])- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CSF ([**1-18**])- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Burkitt's Lymphoma: Pt was seen by heme/onc in ED, and bone marrow bx performed at that time.
She remained on CVVH with tumor lysis labs stable and LDH steadily trending down.
DIC labs remained wnl.
TTE was done to evaluate baseline function prior to doxorubicin.
Methotrexate was given on [**12-23**], Vincristine on [**12-24**] and intrathecal cytarabine on [**12-25**].
CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusions (L>R).
Repeat BM biopsy and CSF studies showed no disease.
Ultrasound was obtained, which demonstrated thrombosis in the right brachial and basilic veins.
Stool checked on [**1-20**] was negative for C.diff so antibiotics were discontined on [**1-22**].
She had 2 stool samples negative for C. diff at this time, but was treated with a course of oral vancomycin to be continued after discharge, at least until her next oncology appointment (scheduled for [**2-3**]).
Derm was consulted- performed biopsy which showed "Intraepidermal vesicles and underlying linear track of ischemia with adjacent dermal inflammation with eosinophils".
Cultures were drawn and grew back VRE.
Surveillance cultures were negative.
Renal function returned to baseline and remained stable off CVVH.
Repeat urine cx neg x 2.
Weight was up to 210+ pounds with 3+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
Her weight on discharge was near 170 pounds with no signs of fluid overload on physical exam.
