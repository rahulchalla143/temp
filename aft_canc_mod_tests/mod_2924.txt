Subsequent biopsy with excision and resection.
He underwent 14 cycles of chemotherapy and follow-up CT scans demonstrated two small pulmonary nodules on the left.
Repeat CT scan was consistent with some enlargement of the pulmonary nodules.
On hospital day number one, he underwent a wedge resection of metastatic melanoma on the left upper and left lower lobes, along with bronchoscopy.
On postoperative day number two, his chest tube was placed on water seal and a chest x-ray was stable.
A chest x- ray following removal of the chest tube revealed a pneumothorax on the left, of about 20% of the lung.
Chest x-ray on postoperative day number three showed resolving pneumothorax.
A repeat chest x-ray on postoperative day number four continued to be stable.
It was decided that the chest tube would be removed, as the last chest x-ray was stable and the patient was discharged home.
