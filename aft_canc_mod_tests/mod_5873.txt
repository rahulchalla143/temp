The patient was found to becteremic by blood cx on [**2127-8-23**] ([**3-31**] positive GPC).
The cultures turned out to be growing MRSE and vancomycin was continued.
Fluid status-  The patient was known to have an EF of 35% on a prior echocardiogram.
Repeat echo showed an EF at this hospitalization of 20-25%.
Based on his large JVD and edema and these lung findings, it was thought that he continued to have the R heart failure physiology seen on echo at this hospitalization and on cath at the past hospitalization.
Goal diuresis was 0.5-1 L net negative per day.
[**Hospital1 **] labs were monitored to check electrolytes during diuresis.
The pt was put on telemetry to monitor cardiac rhythm given extensive heart failure.
[**Name (NI) 27812**] Pt continually had heart rates 90s-100s.
DDx was thought to include intravascular volume depletion, PE, and anxiety.
CT angio ruled out PE and LENI's ruled out LE DVT.
4.ARF- Creatinine baseline was 1.1 - 1.3.
The patient had a Creatinine between 1.5 and 2.0 at this hospitalization.
However, the pt also received a PE protocol chest CT, which may have further stressed the renal function.
The creatinine seemed to peak in the ICU as more fluid was given and began to descend as fluid was tapered.
He was taking PO well and had a 1-1.2L fluid restriction applied to limit his intake of fluids.
ABG was done and revealed a normal blood gas.
BP was low in the unit and the pt received fluids for support.
He was monitored on telemetry.
