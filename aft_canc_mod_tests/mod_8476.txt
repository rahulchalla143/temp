CT OF THE PELVIS: There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis.
CXR [**2120-4-21**]: New mild to moderate right-sided pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.
CT CHEST [**4-23**] - FINDINGS: A large right nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion is increased in size from [**2120-4-21**], and causes near complete collapse of the right lung, with only partial aeration of the right middle and upper lobes.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
A hypoattenuating lesion in the dome of the liver, with central areas of high attenuation, reflects the RF ablation site and is better characterized on the CT of the abdomen performed just 2 days ago.
CXR [**2120-4-26**] - CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Mild cardiomegaly with a tortuous aorta is stable.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist .
TTE [**2120-4-30**] - LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2101-9-28**], mild left ventricular hypertrophy is now detected.
The patient presented with abdominal pain and underwent a CT A&P on admission which demonstrated a new occlusive thrombus in right portal vein and SMV with small bowel and cecal wall thickening and stranding  concerning for ischemia/vasc congestion given occlusion of vessels.
Labs were notable for elevated LFTs (114, 127), alk phos 227, doubling of tbili from baseline (to 3.4), lactate 2.7, and INR 1.4.
Following the addition of the heparin gtt the patient was noted to have serial hematocrits downtrending, initially 41 with trend to 33.9.
Her abdominal exam remained stable throughout her hospitalization.
She was noted to have melena with HCT drop off 41 to 33.
EGD on [**4-22**] demonstrated varices without stigma of bleeding.
# Right pleural effusion - The patient underwent a thoracentesis with results consistent with hepatic hydrothorax.
Micro cultures were negative.
Cirrhosis, portal gastropathy - the patient's home diuretic regimen of spironolactone 100mg and lasix 10mg daily were held given GI bleed.
The patient developed low blood pressure and urine output with this regimen requiring 1L NS and albumin.
Her diuretics were held for one day, then restarted at lasix 10mg and spironolactone 50mg with good effect.
Her weight should continue to be monitored daily and diuretics adjusted as needed to prevent weight gain for accumulation of ascites.
Her chem 7 should be checked on [**5-2**] for further monitoring.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR - the patient developed AF with RVR on [**4-26**].
Her blood pressure remained stable with a rate in the 130s.
She was started on diltiazem 15mg QID with holding parameters of BP<100 and HR<60 with subsequent good control of HR.
She is being discharged on telemetry for continued monitoring and titration of meds for heart rate control.
She underwent a TTE on [**4-30**] which demonstrated a normal EF and no evidence of valvular abnormalities.
The patient is being dishcarged to rehab for continued monitoring on telemetry with blood pressure monitoring and diuretic titration.
Osteoarthritis 3.
Your hematocrit stabilized and you required no further blood transfusions.
You underwent a thoracentesis to treat this fluid accumulation.
During your hospitalization you also developed an irregular and fast heart rate called atrial fibrillation.
You are being discharged on telemetry for further monitoring of your heart rate and adjustment of your medications.
Your urine output and weight will continued to be monitored and adjusted as needed.
