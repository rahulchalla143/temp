She was extubated after surgery and then on [**7-25**] she went into atrial fibrillation and her blood pressure dropped to the 90's and she had shortness of breath.
Her troponin at that time was 3.4 and her CK MB was negative.
She was briefly on Diamox and weaned to a pressure support of [**5-11**], resting in an IMV overnight.
Respiratory rate was in the 20's and total volume 200-400 at that time, then extubated.
On [**8-5**] her Augmentin was discontinued.
She had a period of atrial fibrillation on [**8-7**] with rates in the 70's and a systolic blood pressure in the 70's.
Cardiology fellow called emergently for systolic blood pressure in the 60's and heart rates in the 30's.
She was administered 200 joules with a brief normal sinus rhythm, transient increase in systolic blood pressure but then reverted back to atrial fibrillation.
The patient was then transferred to the MICU with an O2 saturation in the 90's and heart rate in the 150's with a respiratory rate of 28.
She was given Lasix 20 mg IV, became unable to maintain her saturations on her trach mask.
ABG at that time was 7.39, 62 and 75.
She was bagged, tried to replace the trach mass but saturations continued from 88-90%.
She had an AAA repair in [**2100**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**], notable for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, right hip replacement, 100 pack year history of smoking, seasonal allergies and emphysema by pathology.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's vital signs on transfer to the MICU, temperature 98.6, pulse 67-99, blood pressure 88/40 to 100/44, ins and outs, positive 250 cc, ventilator SIMV 450 times 8, 7.5 and 50% O2, pressure support 15, total volume 290, saturation 98%.
Extremities, distal pulses full, trace edema, symmetric.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to the MICU, white blood cells 17,000, hemoglobin 10.7, hematocrit 32.5, platelet count 282,000.
Dipstick urinalysis showed moderate blood, positive nitrites, 100 protein, glucose negative, ketones trace, bilirubin negative.
Glucose 125, BUN 26, creatinine 0.4, sodium 131, potassium 4.0, chloride 90, CO2 30, calcium 9.2, phosphorus 2.4, magnesium 1.4.
Arterial blood gas with PH 7.46, CO2 47 and PO2 122.
Chest x-ray from [**8-15**] showed some interval clearing of the left base with progressive infiltrate and left upper lobe and right upper lobe consistent with infection vs edema.
Pulmonary:  Pneumonia, given multiple infiltrates on the chest x-ray and elevated white blood cell count, treating aggressively for gram negative and will double cover with Levaquin and Ceftaz.
She is on Lopressor for blood pressure and rate control.
Renal/ Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  The patient's electrolytes need repletion, especially given her arrhythmia and to prevent muscle fatigue.
Anemia:  Patient's low blood hematocrit was improving until yesterday with a hematocrit of 32.
Her [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5059**] is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**].
Blood cultures showed no growth times two bottles and C. diff was negative.
The patient had a CT of her chest which showed a left pleural effusion.
The patient tolerated this well with an O2 saturation of 99%.
The patient is currently on pressure support of 10 and PEEP of 5, total volume in the 300's on an FIO2 of 40%.
The patient's arterial blood gas today was 7.41 PH, 56 CO2 and 97 for oxygen.
Patient's hematocrit is stable at 27, up from 26.1 measured on [**8-20**].
Her INR has been consistent at 1.0.
Coumadin will be increased on discharge to 7.5 with instructions to check the INR and dose appropriately.
