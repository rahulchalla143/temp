In the ED, she was initially started on a nipride gtt for BP 190/103.
Her blood pressure decreased to 150s-160s systolic.
CT head was performed and did not demonstrate any acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Labs in the ED demonstrated initial K of 6.3 and the patient was given insulin, D50, kayexalate, and calcium gluconate.
Repeat K was 5.9.
Cardiac enzymes were sent due to mild lateral ST segment depressions; CK was 30 with troponin 0.25 (no prior in our system).
She was maintained on nitroglycerin gtt and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
+ tenderness to palpation in right upper quadrant, negative [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.
Also reports tenderness to palpation in epigastrium.

STUDIES: CT head [**2116-9-20**]: 1.
CT HEAD [**2116-9-22**]: No change from prior study.
PARATHYROID ULTRASOUND [**2116-9-24**]: No enlarged parathyroid gland identified.
At 2 hours pinhole views of the neck and SPECT/CT of the neck and chest were obtained.
Initial images show tracer uptake in the thyroid and another focus in the mediastinum.
# Hypertensive emergency:  The patient presented to ED with BP of 190s/100s and was initially started on a nitroprusside drip.
This was switched to labetolol on hospital day two and she was placed back on her home antihypertensive regimen of losartan and metoprolol on [**9-21**] and weaned off of the labetolol drip by [**9-22**] with blood pressures in the 140s to 150s systolic.
Given that her blood pressures appeared to be better controlled on labetalol her metoprolol was switched to labetalol at equal conversion.
She received two non-contrast head CTs which were negative for acute hemmorhage.
On presentation she was anticoagulated for pulmonary embolism with coumadin and her INR was elevated.
A lumbar puncture was performed on [**9-23**] by neurology.
There was no blood found in the CSF and preliminary cultures have been negative.
On presentation her blood sugars were fluctuating and she was unable to take POs secondary to nausea.
Last hemoglobin A1C was 6.2 on admission.
# Anemia: On presentation the patient's hematocrit was 32.7.
This was intitially thought to be secondary to dilution as all cell lines were decreased.
Her hematocrit remained stable in the low 20s for the remainder of her MICU course.
Iron studies were consistent with an anemia of chronic inflammation.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
No source of infection was found on blood cultures or on chest X-ray.
She underwent a nuclear medicine scan which showed an affected area in her mediastinal region suggesting a single mediastinal parathyroid adenoma.
Warfarin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO at bedtime: Take 2 tablets (5mg)4x/week on Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat - and take 1 tablet (2.5mg) 3x/week on Tues, Thurs, Sun.
You have been evaluated with imaging of your head that did not reveal any abnormalities and lab tests to monitor your electrolytes and check for infection.
You should get your INR checked again soon - this should be done at dialysis on Monday and checked 2-3 times per week until you are in good control.
More importantly, you had a special X-ray done (or nuclear medicine/sestimibi scan) which showed that you have what is likely a benign tumor (called a parathyroid adenoma) in your neck which is causing this elevated level.
You should follow-up with here at [**Hospital1 18**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (endocrine surgeon) for evaluation and possible removal of this gland.
Follow-up with your [**Hospital 197**] Clinic 3-5 days post-discharge for a INR check and dose adjustment.
