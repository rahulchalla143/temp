OSH arterial duplex was performed at LGH that by report demonstrated no flow in the right DP, with a monophasic PT.
Imaging revealed a pericardial effusion so Cardiology was consulted.
Pulsus was 6 but TTE showed evidence of tamponade physiology so she was taken to the cath lab for pericardiocentesis (apical approach).
Removed 475cc bloody fluid, mean pericardial pressure was 17.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS (+): Mild DOE recently, after walking a few blocks.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Echo ([**2154-5-17**]): Pre-pericardiocentesis (images [**1-18**]): Large circumferential pericardial effusion.
Post-pericardiocentesis (images 32-38): Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
ECHO ([**2154-5-18**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Small circumferential pericardial effusion w/o echocardiographic signs of tamponade physiology.
If clinicallly indicated, serial evaluation is suggested.
ECHO ([**2154-5-19**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Small anterior pericardial effusion w/o echocardiographic signs of tamponade physiology.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-5-18**], the pericardial effusion is smaller with less fluid accumulation posteriorly.
ECHO ([**2154-5-20**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-5-19**], the findings are similar.
Pericardial Biopsy [**2154-5-22**]: Pericardium (A): Poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with breast origin, (see note).
CXR [**2154-5-24**] INDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**5-23**], there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The apparent engorgement of pulmonary vessels on the previous study has substantially decreased.
Pericardial fluid analysis revealed no bacteria on gram stain and no growth on culture.
Repeat TTE after removal of drain, performed on [**2154-5-20**], demonstrated no significant increase in pericardial fluid.
Left pleural effusion: s/p pleurx [**5-15**] (also drained 1L on [**5-17**]).
In setting of Hct decreasing, repleted with 2u pRBCs on [**2154-5-19**].
?s Hct on admission 37.9 --> 31.8, likely secondary to hemoconcentration on admission.
Factor Xa level was checked and was therapeutic prior to discharge.
A drain was placed to remove the fluid but it recurred so a pericardial window was cut into the lining of your heart to help the fluid drain.
We increased your dose of lovenox to prevent you from getting further blood clots.
