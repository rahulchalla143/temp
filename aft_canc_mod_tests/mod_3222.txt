He reports that his cough is not productive of sputum, but that when he coughs, he feels like he needs to vomit.
A chest CT was performed in [**11-15**] which showed a 3.1 x 1.7 cm cavitary mass in the superior segment of the right lower lobe in addition to multiple large mediastinal lymph nodes.
There were also several lytic lesions in the thoracic and lumbar spine which were concerning for metastases.
Sputum cytology was negative for AFB and malignant cells but transbronchial needle aspiration showed atypical epithelioid and inflammatory cells suspicious for malignancy and precarinal LN and bronchial washings were both positive for malignant cells, consistent with NSCLC.
An echo showed a large echodense pericardial effusion consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
A repeat echo showed that the effusion had decreased in size and the RV collapse had resolved.
The pericardial fluid cytology was positive for malignant cells consistent with non-small cell metastatic carcinoma.
His repeat ECHO showed greatly decreased size of pericardial effusion and the pericardial drain was pulled.

An echo showed a large echodense pericardial effusion consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
A repeat echo showed that the effusion had decreased in size and the RV collapse had resolved.
The pericardial fluid cytology was positive for malignant cells consistent with non-small cell metastatic carcinoma.
A post-drainage echo showed a moderate sized residual pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade.
Pt has been hemodynamically since drainage, w/ no complaints of any SOB, with a normal pulsus and with repeat echos showing no change in size of the pericardial effusion.
His WBC went from 17.7 on presentation to 33.3 on [**1-3**] but came down to 16.2 on [**1-11**] on discharge.
# Positive PPD - Pt with recent history of positive PPD.
Bronchial washings from time of diagnosis with NSCLC were negative for AFB.
Mycobacterial cultures will be followed up by ID.
# Low EF - Pt noted on inital echo to have a normal EF, but on poist-drainage echo to have a low EF at 30%.
A repeat echo on [**1-10**] showed a normal EF.
Head MRI showed no evidence of brain metastases.
A repeat CXR on [**1-9**] showed resolution of bilateral pleural effusions.
Plan was to transfuse pt for Hct<21 but pt's Hct has increased without transfusion.
Pt's neuro exam appears intact.
