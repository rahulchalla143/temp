The diarrhea began 4 days ago and initially was without blood but the following day he noticed stool mixed with blood (~[**1-13**] pint).
Called his oncologist who had him present for CBC Tuesday with Hb 9.7, thrombocytopenia to 20s (near baseline values) and then repeat on Thursday where he was found to have Hbg decreased to 5 and sent to the ED.
In the ED, T 97.4 HR 96 BP 162/92 RR 18 SaO2 99% on RA.

His hct responded from 15-->22 and then was stable over 48hr.
We felt it prudent to continue to hold his long-acting beta-blocker, atenolol, and discussed this with the patient and he agreed with this plan.
#Dispo:  To home doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] once his bleeding stopped and his hct was stable.
