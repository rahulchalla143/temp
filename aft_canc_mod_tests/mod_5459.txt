PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Right-sided temporal tumor.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2193-1-17**] 12:09 AM IMPRESSION: Large right superior temporal lobe and deep white matter mass with surrounding edema, most likely representing neoplasia.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2193-1-23**] 9:40 AM IMPRESSION: Minimal improvement in the post-surgical changes in the right frontotemporal region.
Minimal improvement in the midline shift and mass effect since the prior examination from [**2193-1-21**].
A full work-up did not reveal a primary tumor anywhere in his body.
He did well post operatively intially was awake, alert and orientated X3 no true deficits noted a follow up head MRI showed The resection cavity in the right superior temporal lobe is unchanged in appearance, with air and blood products within it.
On post op day 2 he was found to be more lethargic a stat head CT showed right uncal herniation from edema he was given 100 Gm of Mannitol , Lasix, Steroids 10mg and increased to 8mg Q6 and tranferred to the SICU.
A head Ct on [**1-23**] showed minimal improvement of edema and midline shift.
