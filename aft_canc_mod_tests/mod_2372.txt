CXR was unchanged, and CT head showed no new mets or bleed.

[**2161-3-10**] - CXR - Residual vs. recurrent air space disease in the right lower lobe as detailed above.
[**2161-3-11**] - CT Chest with and without contrast - 1.
[**2161-3-11**] - CXR - 1) Rapidly evolving bilateral interstitial process, which may be due to interstitial edema from fluid overload considering history of recent hydration.
[**2161-3-12**] - Echo - no definite vegetations seen (suboptimal study); basal inferior posterior infarct; mild aortic stenosis CHEST PORT.
EGD [**2161-3-15**] Findings: Zenker's diverticulum noted- making esophageal intubation difficult.
Large blood clot visible in duodenal bulb- protruding from pylorus.
ECG Study Date of [**2161-3-15**] Atrial fibrillation.
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2161-3-17**] 1.
Perforation of the duodenum with pneumoperitoneum and extraluminal oral contrast 2.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-16**], at least moderate mitral regurgitation and right ventricular cavity enlargement/free wall hypokinesis is now seen.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define the mitral valve structure and clarify the severity of mitral regurgitation.
ECG [**2161-3-18**] Sinus rhythm; Atrial and ventricular ectopic activity; Leftward axis; Right bundle branch block; Inferior T wave changes are nonspecific; Low QRS voltages in precordial leads; Since previous tracing of [**2161-3-15**], atrial fibrillation resolved CXR [**2161-3-20**] IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion has decreased and previous mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved since [**3-18**].
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-3-22**] There is a left-sided dual-lead pacemaker.
A line or catheter projects over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-3-25**] Comparison is made with the prior study from 11 hours earlier.
Infection was a possibility, as his CXR showed likely old infiltrate (previously treated for PNA here 4 weeks ago).
CT head was negative.
CXR with resolving PNA, and repeat after hydration showed interstitial process .
RUE u/s was negatve; humerous xray was negative for fracture; CT scan with contrast was negative for central vein thrombus .
Cough: Pt with cough on exam initially and CXR showed resolving PNA .
CXR [**3-15**] showed evidence of possible new bibasilar lung process concerning for PNA.
Sputum Cx positive for GNR.
Abdominal CT performed showing perforation of duodenal ulcer with free air in the peritoneum.
Degree of abdominal tenderness on exam significantly improved.
Continue to monitor pressures, check serial hct, serial physical exams, and ABGs.
CXR [**3-15**] showed evidence of possible new bibasilar lung process concerning for PNA.
Sputum Cx positive for GNR.
Plan to continue to trend Cr and renaly dose all meds .
SURGICAL SERVICE COURSE [**3-18**] - [**3-26**] On [**3-18**], pt underwent an emergent exploratory laparotomy w/ repair of a perforated duodenal ulcer (please refer to operative note for details).
A repeat ECHO on [**3-24**] demonstrated an EF of 30%-35%, moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation and mild aortic regurgitation.
EKG did not demonstrate significant changes from previous tracings.
He was maintained until early AM on [**3-26**], when his BP was continuing to decline despite medical support.
He had nebulizer treatments and aggressive chest PT by nursing.
A speech and swallow consult was called for evaluation of his decreased speech volume/ability.
His G-port was left open to gravity.
His abdominal exam was improving markedly.
A G-tube study on [**3-24**] demonstrated a patent G-tube and J-tube without evidence of leak.
During his period of decompensation, his abdmonial exam was benign, his incision and drains were all intact.
His urine output dramatically declined during his episode of rapid decompensation on [**3-25**] and he eventually went into renal failure w/ anuria and a creatinine of 1.8. .
Heme: His hematocrit post-op was stable and did not necessitate further blood transfusions.
This was changed to caspofungin after blood cultures returned w/ [**Female First Name (un) **] (TORULOPSIS) GLABRATA.
ECHO did not reveal any vegetations.
His blood sugars were well-controlled.
SVT s/p PPm in [**2155**] 3.
AAA repair [**2155**] 4.
