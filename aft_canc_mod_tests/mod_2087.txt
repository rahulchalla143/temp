On admission, she was noted to have INR 8.1 in her PCP's office.
She was also found to have a CXR which showed left lung collapse with tracheal deviation to the left, and was referred to our ED for this, where she received a combivent nebulizer prior to transfer.
On presentation to the ED, the patient was complaining of dyspnea and was tachypneic with respiratory rate to 25 with O2 sat 95% on 5L.
Otherwise, her systolic blood pressure was in the 110 range and pulse in 80-90 range.
Her admission labs were remarkable for WBC of 22.7 and INR of 11.7.
Oncology is setting up a complete outpatient workup for this patient, including Pet CT. She was also seen by ENT for evaluation of hoarseness.

RADIOLOGY: ========= CXR [**2162-8-17**]- 1.
CT scan can be performed for further evaluation to assess etiology.
CT [**2162-8-17**]- Nearly complete collapse of the left lung, accelerated over several hours.
CT [**2162-8-20**]- 1.
CXR ([**8-20**]): Left lower lobe has been substantially reexpanded.
Labs at discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 47011**] is a 69 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (4L NC), status post left upper lobe reduction, CAD, CHF, peripheral vascular disease on chronic anticoagulation who presented with dyspnea secondary to left lung collapse and associated tracheal deviation.
On bronchoscopy, the patient had a mass seen with biopsies taken which were consistent with squamous cell lung cancer; a subsequent CT chest confirms extensive intrathroacic malignancy.
A subsequent CT chest confirms extensive intrathroacic malignancy.
At that time, her coumadin was held, and her INR improved with vitamin K. Heparin was started for bridge to coumadin prior to discharge, and transitioned to lovenox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] until her INR becomes therapeutic.
On day of discharge, INR was 1.6 today, we therefore increased coumadin to 2mg po daily today, and discharged home on lovenox 50mg SC BID (to treat embolic occlusion of left subclavian artery), while waiting for INR to become therapeutic.
She will have home VNA check INR daily and fax results to PCP ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) **], fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]).
#) Hematocrit drop: The patient's drop in hematocrit was most likely dilutional.
Her hematocrit was otherwise stable throughout admission.
WBC was 12 on day of discharge, felt [**12-31**] steroid use.
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): please have INR checked by home VNA daily and sent to your PCP.
Outpatient Lab Work please have home VNA draw labs DAILY to check INR and send the results to your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
