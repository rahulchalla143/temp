IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2146-8-26**] 1:45 PM There are lower lung volumes with worsened bibasilar opacities likely worsening atelectasis.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-8-25**] at 9:47:32 AM      FINAL  IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-8-2**], the findings are similar.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2146-8-24**] 10:17 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Suboptimal scan due to motion in the scanner with suboptimal valuation of the posterior fossa.
This could be better evaluated with a repeat CT, or with MR. .

On the night of [**8-23**], she had a temperature of 102.6.
In the MICU, Ms. [**Known lastname 1557**] was requiring levophed to maintain her blood pressures, which was transitioned to vasopressin, then titrated off after 3 total days on pressors.
When she arrived on the general medicine floor, her SBP was in the 80s and 90s with occasional tachycardia to the 100s or low 110s.
Etiology of her sepsis remained unclear as she had negative blood cultures throughout her stay.
TTE was performed for evaluation of endocarditis but did not demonstrate vegetations.
Due to her need for pressors, fluid boluses, antibiotics, blood products, and chronic TPN, she had a temporary Quad-lumen central line catheter placed in the left femoral vein for extra access proximal to her tunneled double-lumen Hickman.
CT Head was performed and demonstrated areas of hypodensity in L basal ganglia and L cerebellum.
MRI would have been a preferred follow-up imaging study, but patient cannot tolerate MRI studies due to iodine reaction and metal hardware.
The LP was never performed as the patient's condition improved.
Given her history of dysphagia, the Trans Esophageal Echocardiogram was not performed as it would have first required an EGD and then a TEE, both of which would have required general anesthesia in this patient.
She was transfused 1 unit of pRBCs in the ICU for a Hct of 19 on [**2146-8-25**].
Hold medication if respiratory rate slows to less than 12 per minute.
Disp:*20 doses* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Diversified VNA [**Location (un) 1157**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary DXs: #Sepsis, SIRS criteria by temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and WBCs<4000 cells/mL in the setting of incomplete treatment for previously documented bacteremia and a high clinical suspicion for fungemia.
As a result of low blood pressure in the context of suspected infection you were treated in the intensive care unit with continued antibiotics and medications to support your blood pressure.
Imaging of your head did not show lesions that would cause these abnormalities, however some nonspecific changes were seen in other areas.
There was no active process that was seen on imaging, but this imaging was limited by your iodine reaction preventing the use of contrast and the metal hardware in your body that prevent the use of MRI imaging.
You receieved a transthoracic echocardiogram which was reviewed by multiple physicians looking for this infection.
After reviewing the previous tests it was determined that the images of the transthoracic echocardiogram were adequate to confirm a very low likelihood of endocarditis.
At this time, given your stable condition, the risks of pursuing any further imaging were deemed to outweigh the potential benefit.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you have recurrent symptoms especially if you have a fever, are in dramatically worse pain, or have low blood pressure and a fast heart rate that doesn't respond to fluids.
