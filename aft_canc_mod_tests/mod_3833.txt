Imaging: CXR ([**2-28**]):IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs since [**1-7**], most recently [**2-23**]: There is new mild perihilar interstitial abnormality in the left lung, exaggeration of the opacity, slight increase in caliber to the mediastinum in the region of the azygos vein and a cross-sectional area of hilar pulmonary arteries suggests that the interval change could all be due to pulmonary edema although an interstitial pneumonia such as viral infection cannot be excluded.
Elevation of the right lung base is longstanding, but small right pleural effusion appears to have increased.
CXR ([**2-28**]):  Left subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates within the lower aspect of the SVC.
Lung volumes are lower than on the previous examination.
