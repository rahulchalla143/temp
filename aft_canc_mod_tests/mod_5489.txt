[**8-19**] T/L spine MRI No post-traumatic abnormality seen in the thoracic or lumbar spine.
[**8-20**] C spine MRI On the sagittal images, there is no malalignment or loss of vertebral body height.
Axial images at C2-C3 demonstrate mild disc bulge without significant central or foraminal stenosis.
[**8-31**] CTA chest FINDINGS: There are extensive filling defects within bilateral pulmonary arteries and extending into all branches.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

**FINAL REPORT [**2148-9-8**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2148-9-8**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Trimethoprim/Sulfa sensitivity testing confirmed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].
[**9-16**] CXR Two radiographs of the chest demonstrate a similar cardiomediastinal contour to that seen on [**2148-8-31**].
An echocardiogram obtained on [**9-2**] showed evidence of impaired right ventricular function, but troponins were negative.
He should have a repeat echocardiogram in [**3-8**] weeks to reassess his cardiac function.
Atrial fibrillation, with rapid ventricular response: On [**8-31**] the patient experienced palpitations and was found to have a heart rate in the 140's.
He was initially treated with metoprolol with decrease in his blood pressure to 98/64.
He was subsequently transistioned to oral diltiazem, which he will continue for rhythm control.
His hematocrit decreased from 38.9 on [**8-30**] to 32.8 on [**8-31**]; this was thought to be at least partially due to dilution.
He underwent colonoscopy on [**9-12**] which showed a 1cm pedunculated benign appearing polyp in the sigmoid colon which was removed; pathology is pending at time of discharge and needs to be followed up by his outpatient physicians.
He will need a repeat colonoscopy in 3 years.
As he was having loose stools, C. diff toxin was sent which was positive ([**9-15**]) sample.
Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium trended to the low 30's during his hospitalization.
He will need to have his sodiums monitored daily while his PO intake is variable.
Anemia: The patient's iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
His hematocrit remained stable during his course on the floor.
He should have his hematocrit monitored during his stay in rehab with a repeat hematocrit as an outpatient.
Note that as the patient is a Jehovah's Witness he does not want any blood products.
Pulmonary embolism 3.
Colon polyp, pathology pending 8.
An MRI of your neck showed that the spinal cord was being compressed so you had to undergo surgery by the orthopedics spine team.
The colonoscopy did not show any active bleeding, but you did have one colon polyp that was removed.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] from orthopedics ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 54028**]) on Thursday [**10-3**] at 9:30 at [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 2 [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].
