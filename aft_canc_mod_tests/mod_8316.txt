GRAM STAIN (Final [**2180-3-15**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
CXR [**2180-3-8**] FINDINGS: The lungs are well expanded and clear.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
IMPRESSION: Stable radiographic examination with known thoracic compression fracture and no acute pulmonary process .
CT HEAD [**3-8**] FINDINGS: There is no edema or shift of normally midline structures to suggest the presence of an intracranial mass.
However, retrospective evaluation of the CT scan done on [**2178-5-2**], demonstrates a similar lesion, in the right frontal region, in a slightly different plane (likely related to the angulation of the gantry, which is different from the MR angulation) and this is seen on the post-contrast CT done on [**2178-5-2**], series 4, image 8.
[**3-11**]: MRI OF THE PITUITARY: On the pre-contrast sequences of the pituitary, there is no enlargement of the sella or the pituitary gland, the infundibular stalk is almost in the midline.
Small, 0.8 x 0.3 cm enhancing extradural lesion in the right frontal region, likely representing meningioma, retrospectively noted on the CT scan done on [**2178-5-2**], with no significant change.
[**2180-3-13**] MRI Pituitary CONCLUSION: Limited study due to motion artifact.
[**2180-3-14**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Moderate-high grade stenosis of left subclavian artery beyond its origin is slightly worse than [**2178-12-30**].
A focal calyceal diverticulum is more prominent than [**2180-5-2**], likely secondary to scarring.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is no free fluid, free air or evidence of obstruction.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**2180-3-29**] IMPRESSION: Since the previous MRI examination, there is increased signal identified within the spinal cord with enhancement in its central portion suspicious for cord ischemia versus infarct.
MR/MRA Head [**2180-3-29**]: IMPRESSION: No significant change since the previous MRI examination of [**2180-3-9**].
CT head negative for evidence of acute CVA.
Neuro exam non-focal but she was with marked memory and attention deficits.
Despite her correction of electrolytes and treatment for UTI the patient continued to have a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
Further workup demonstrated an inappropriately low TSH, elevated prolactin and lower than expected FSH and LH.
The patient underwent an MRI of her pituitary to evaluate for stalk compression vs. metastatic disease.
MRI of the head was negative but incidentally found small R meningioma.
Given her persistent MS changes and history of malignancy and immunosuppression on steroids she underwent lumbar puncture.
CSF was negative for evidence of infection.
CSF cytology to evaluate for metastatic disease was also negative.
A CT torso was performed and on final exam of the imaging the patient was found to have a new 1.5 cm hypodensity in the left lobe of the liver, suspicious for metastasis.
A CT of the spine noted a cervical paraspinal mass.
Pathology of the mass was positive for Metastatic adrenal cancer.
CT of the Head was done and was negative for ICH or stroke.
An MRI of the C-spine was performed and showed likely C2-C7 ischemia.
Several Family meetings have occurred with the primary team, along with her oncologist, endocrinologist and Pain and Palliative Care.
Objective tests have not shown this to be true but a 2nd Lumbar puncture may have sealed the diagnosis.
The family has opted against lumbar puncture as it would cause discomfort to Ms. [**Known lastname 1729**].
A new neck mass was found on CT of the neck.
# UTI - On admission the patient was found to have a UTI, urine culture grew >100,000 cfu/ml.
# Post-menopausal bleeding - PAP and documented pelvic exam of [**12-1**] by PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
