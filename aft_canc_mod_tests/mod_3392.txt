female with a h/o severe PVD including AAA status post repair and stenting, and metastatic Ca of unknown primary complicated by T7 destructive lesion here in [**12-26**], s/p T3-T11 fusion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] status post radiation with left pelvic metastasis, s/p XRT to chest and cervical subcutaneous soft tissue mass consistent with small cell lung cancer metastasis and paraneoplastic syndrome manifest with diffuse lower extremity weakness who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from her rehab for initiation of chemotherapy.
She was started on IVIG for paraneoplastic weakness during her recent admission ([**2102-4-27**] to [**2102-5-31**]) and discharged to rehab where she did not continue to receive IVIG.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2102-5-2**] the findings are similar.
CT [**6-30**]:  CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Air bronchogram containing right lower lobe consolidation is not significantly changed from [**5-4**], [**2101**] examination.
Large left infrahilar mass is grossly stable from [**5-4**] examination but significantly increased from [**2101-11-18**] examination measuring 18 x 24 mm currently and displays mass effect on the adjacent lower lobe bronchus.
Large soft tissue lesion posterior to T1 has also increased in size from [**Month (only) 116**] examination from 33 x 52 mm to 38 x 74 mm on today's exam (3:1).
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, stomach, small bowel, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: Intrapelvic bowel, uterus, and urinary bladder appear normal.
Stable left infrahilar mass from [**Month (only) 116**] examination but significant progression from [**2101-10-20**] examination.
Chest x-ray at that time demonstrated interstitial infiltrates.
Blood gas showed 7.39/41/53 presumably while on 5 litres nasal cannula.
On morning of ICU transfer, she continued to remain tachycardic, with oxygen requirement of 70% facemask, saturating in high 90s.
She continued to have hemoptysis with progressively worsening anemia, with a hematocrit of 22.
CTA was deferred, but bilateral LENIs, chest x-ray, and echocardiogram were ordered.
ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 120 bpm, normal axis and intervals, normal QRS norphology, no specific ST or T-wave changes.
CXR on transfer showed increased bilateral parenchymal interstitial markings, evolving left peri-hilar opacification, and persistent right-lower perihilar infiltrate, with no effusions.
An infectious work-up was initiated to evaluate further for an additional etiology for her symptoms, in addition to the SCLC.
She was pancultured with negative UCx, negative Legionella Ag in urine, and BCx pending to date.
WBC increased to 28K.
CXR from HD# 6 revealed a new left perihilar opacity, suggestive of PNA in comparison to CXR from [**5-30**].
Sputum Cx showed GPCs and GNRs.
By HD#8, the WBC count had dropped to 6K as part of a pancytopenic response to the chemotherapy.
It was considered that no benefit was obtained from the Dexamethasone 1mg QD dosing.
Fondaparinux 2.5 mg/0.5 mL (1) Subcutaneous DAILY 6.
Oxycodone 40 mg Tablet Sustained Release 12 hr (1)Tablet Sustained Release 12 hr PO Q8H 12.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL 15-30 MLs PO QID 16.
