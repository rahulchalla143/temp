A sterile speculum exam was performed and PPROM was confirmed with ferning and nitrazine.
A digital exam was deferred, however, she had a digital exam in the ED which revealed a closed cervix.
Fetal testing was reassuring.
An [**Doctor Last Name 13675**] consult (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was obtained and ultrasound revealed EFW 931g, vtx, AFI 13.6, and large uterine fibroids obstructing the lower uterine segment.
A GLT was done prior to administering the BMZ and was normal (130).
A NICU consult was obtained and after prolonged monitoring on labor and delivery, she was transferred to the antepartum floor.
Mrs [**Known lastname **] was on bedrest and had extensive monitoring with three times daily fetal heartrate tracings, twice weekly BPPs, and a growth scan on [**2158-9-22**] which showed an EFW of 1182g(51%).
Fetal testing remained reassuring and her AFI ranged from 1-6.5 cm.
Her fetal tracings would tyypically have moderate variability with small accelerations and an occasional quick variable.
Her white blood cell count was 9.7 at that time.
Upon arrival, there was difficulty obtaining a continuous tracing and a bedside ultrasound revealed a fetal heartrate in the 60's.
Liveborn male infant from breech, apgars of 2,5,6.
She had an EBL of 3000cc and she received 7L of crystalloid, 4U PRBCs, and 2U FFP, therefore there was concern for fluid overload and airway edema.
Ms [**Known lastname **] was continued on Zosyn and Vanco for 4 days, on post-operative day 5, she was switched to Keflex as her blood and urine cultures were negative.
