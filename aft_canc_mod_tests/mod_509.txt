The patient's creatinine was noted to be 5.7 on admission, and her normal baseline creatinine is 1.2.
The patient initially was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was aggressively fluid resuscitated with a return of her systolic blood pressure to a baseline of 100-110 and her creatinine improved to 1.6.
An abdominal ultrasound on [**2102-4-9**], however, showed no common bile duct dilatation, and no evidence of cholecystitis.
In addition, an MRCP was performed on [**2102-4-11**] which showed no intra or extrahepatic duct dilatation but did show diffuse metastatic disease to the liver and splenomegaly with diffuse anasarca.
An MRI of the L spine was obtained which showed no evidence of metastatic disease to the L spine and the pain was thought to be secondary to capsular distention from her extensive hepatic metastatic disease.
Liver metastases diagnosed in [**2102-3-23**].
Vital signs: Temperature 98, blood pressure 111/37, heart rate 72, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 99% on room air.
Pulses paradoxus was less than 10.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 12.1, hematocrit 32, platelets 243,000.
The LFTs were remarkable for an ALT of 198, AST 526, alkaline phosphatase 451, total bilirubin 2.0, albumin 3.0.
CEA on [**2102-4-5**] was 203, CA19-9 32 and CA27.29 459.
Chest x-ray:  Enlarged heart with atelectasis at the left costophrenic angle and low lung volumes.
However, on [**2102-4-16**], the patient became hypotensive with blood pressures running 70/40 without response to fluid boluses.
In addition, the patient's urine output significantly declined to less than 100 cc in an eight hour shift.
A bladder scan was obtained which showed 330 cc present; however, it was felt that this result was likely erroneous given the patient's anasarca.
The patient's creatinine rose from 1.6 to 1.9 on [**2102-4-16**].
At that time, it was decided that aggressive measures to increase her blood pressure via pressors was not indicated.
Further discussion occurred with the cross-covering medicine team and the patient's husband and at that time it was again re-emphasized that the role of pressor treatment in the Intensive Care Unit would likely be only a transient measure as the patient does have progressive metastatic breast cancer and was likely not to recover.
