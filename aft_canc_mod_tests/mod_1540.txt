Head CT demonstrated a lesion in the left frontal lobe consistent with metastatic renal carcinoma.
He was noted to have intermittent word-finding difficulties and a lumbar puncture was performed with cytology pending.
He was noted to have had a low ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent, as well as focal wall motion abnormalities that were new since [**2168-1-12**] in the distal anterior apical region.
Carotid ultrasound was performed which showed 60 to 79 percent right internal carotid artery stenosis.
Renal cell carcinoma, diagnosed in [**2168-1-12**].
Subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 2.0 to 2.5.
The patient's general exam was significant for decreased breath sounds at the apices bilaterally.
On initial neurologic examination he was described as having full power in the extremities bilaterally with intact cranial nerve exam on the Medicine neurologic examination  LABORATORY RESULTS ON ADMISSION:  Head MRI demonstrated a mass along the superior sagittal sinus and left parietal convexity without herniation or mass affect.
Initial lumbar puncture demonstrated 908 RBCs which cleared to 395 RBCs on tube four.
Glucose was 76 and protein was 146.
EKG demonstrated T-wave inversions in the inferior leads as well as V3.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  A Neurology consult was obtained with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and it was felt that the patient's right hemiparesis was likely secondary to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 555**] paralysis.
On [**1-4**], the patient underwent an MRI of the head, subsequently found to have evidence of a complete right internal carotid artery occlusion and underwent angiography for possible revascularization.
The MRI scan was performed in the setting of incoherent speech, evidence of left-sided neglect and right gaze deviation.
........... venogram showed decreased flow in the superior sagittal sinus.
Repeat MRI scan did not show evidence of DII abnormalities despite complete right internal carotid artery occlusion.
head CT and his heparin was discontinued.
Head CT did not show evidence of bleed but there were hypodense regions along the right centrum semiovale.
On [**1-6**], the patient had an episode of tachycardia with a drop in his blood pressure to a systolic of approximately 130.
head CT to rule out herniation and there was evidence of significant mass affect with right hemisphere edema.
