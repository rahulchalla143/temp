An EKG showed sinus tachycardia without evidence of right heart strain.
Patient was transferred to ICU for close monitoring in context of large clot [**Hospital1 8373**].

CXR [**2158-12-11**]: chest read in conjunction with CT scanning of the chest earlier in the day performed elsewhere: Heterogeneous opacification at the base of the right lung conforms to the appearance on CT scanning earlier today, most likely pneumonia or extensive aspiration.
Mild emphysema is demonstrated on the CT scan.

significant for recent left lower extremity DVT now with bilateral lower extremity DVTs and PE, who was found to have a pelvic mass on CT concerning for ovarian cancer.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound performed for an urelated reason showed ascites and a cystic pelvis mass concerning for ovarian cancer, which was again seen on pelvic CT scan.
OVARIAN MASS:  LFT abnormalities prompted an abdominal US, which showed complex ascites and a pelvic mass with cystic and solid components.
A follow up CT scan confirmed the presence of a mass highly concerning for ovarian adenocarcinoma.
She was not deemed to be a surgical candidate due to her extensive clot [**Last Name (LF) 8373**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a preliminary plan for neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical debulking was formulated, after obtaining tissue for confirmatory diagnosis via CT-guided biopsy.
She will be set up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of heme/onc early next week and her biopsy and chemotherapy will be coordinated thereafter.
FEVER/CONSOLIDATION ON CT:  She was started on levaquin in the ICU on [**12-11**] for CXR evidence of RLL consolidation that was thought to be infection versus infarction.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed that this lesion  was likely infarction.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: She will require prompt followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for coordination of her biopsy and further care of a potential ovarian malignancy.
The gynecology and heme/onc teams saw you, and decided to get a definitive diagnosis with a biopsy before starting chemotherapy, if necessary.
You'll start lovenox instead of coumadin to better prevent further clots, which were likely driven by this mass, as it increases risk of clotting.
