FINDINGS: Examination was performed with a standard soft tissue algorithm and does not well evaluate the brain parenchyma.
Ill-defined abnormality in the left middle cranial fossa is seen consistent with findings on [**2167-1-3**] on the MRI study of enhancing mass with adjacent edema of the temporal lobe and malacic change.
These findings are probably similar to the MRI study of [**1-3**].
CT angiogram of the cervical vessels and intracranial circulation.
Abnormality in left middle cranial fossa consistent with the findings on the MRI study.
Postgadolinium T1-weighted images in three planes.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

The excess bulk of soft tissue was then excised from the flap which was fairly thick.
The lining of the sinus was excised and with this we were able to elevate the cheek flap more and while tangentially excising much of this excess tissue we encountered tannish whitish almost gelatinous tissue which did not appear normal but we were not surprised that the frozen section on this biopsy was consistent with a malignant spindle cell type tumor.
The ala of the nose which was pulled inward and internally compresses was then released.

*Per clinical note in computer, this patient originally had a lentigo maligna melanoma, desmoplastic neurotropic type, S-100 and Mart-1 positive, diagnosed at [**Hospital6 1129**] in [**2158**].
His hematocrit was monitored daily and was overall stable without transfusion.
His electrolytes were checked on [**1-3**] secondary to an episode of confusion.
His sodium level was 118.
He was placed on 1 liter fluid restriction daily and serum/urine osmolarities were sent (Serum Osm =248; Urine Osm =463).
His hyponatremia resolved on fluid restriction and his sodium was in normal range at discharge.
They believed that the bleeding appeared to be coming from necrotic or neoplastic mucosa, which may not heal normally and therefore, were concerned that when packs are removed, the tissue will continue bleeding.
Neuroembolization of the left maxillary artery was performed on [**1-6**] by the neurointerventional radiologists.
