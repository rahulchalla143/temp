Since the previous tracing of [**2155-6-1**] sinus tachycardic rate is slower and further ST-T wave changes are present.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-5-23**], image quality is extremely poor on the current study.
[**6-19**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia at a rate of 117.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2155-6-17**] the changes are similar but somewhat more prominent to those seen at that time.
