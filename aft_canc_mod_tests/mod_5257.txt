IN [**Name (NI) **] pt's vitals were 98.3, 113/61, 67 100% 2L.
CXR revealed large increasd L effusion, increasing R effusion, spiculated unchanged opacity LUL.
labs revealed WBC of 14 and Lactate 1.1. cardiac enzymes were negative and ekg revealed no acute ischemic changes or right heart heart strain.
Since that time, she has been followed by serial PET CT scans for her known CLL and pulmonary nodules.
A CT on [**7-19**] showed moderate bilateral dependent pleural effusions and multiple loculated collections of pleural fluid in the right hemithorax.
She was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.

Unchanged spiculated opacity within the left upper lobe, which on the prior CT was worrisome for malignancy.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure/somnolence - resolving with improvement in ventilation on most recent ABG.
Surveillance cultures negative.
# Bilateral pleural effusions - Pleural fluid exudative, cytology suspicious for metastatic melanoma, not diagnostic.
