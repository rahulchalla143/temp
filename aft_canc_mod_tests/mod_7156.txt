COMPARISON: Non-contrast head CT from [**2196-2-2**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT was obtained.
FINDINGS: Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation associated with a subtle region of hypodensity within the right frontal lobe near the vertex (2:24-25), new in comparison to CT [**2196-2-2**], is concerning for relatively acute infarction.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
A neurology consult was obtained and a CT scan was performed.
The CT scan was inconclusive and an MRI was recommended but unable due to epicardial wires.
An EEG was performed which was abnormal suggesting a widespread encephalopathy or a metabolic anoxic or postictal etiology.
A video EEG was performed which did not show any seizure activity but did show a markedly encephalopathic background.
She slowly became more alert moving her right side and only responding to painful stimuli on her left side.
Her sputum culture revealed serratia marcescens and ceftriaxone was started.
She underwent repeat CT scan that had findings concerning for relavtively acute right frontovertex infarct.
