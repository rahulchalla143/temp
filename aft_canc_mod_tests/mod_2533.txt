Its appearance is similar in the axial plane to prior study from [**2149-1-8**].
Multiple circumscribed hypodense structures arise from the kidney which consist of simple fluid, the largest of which measures 4.5 cm in diameter in upper pole of the right kidney.
Portocaval mass as described above; evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT may be considered once the patient's renal function improves.
[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT (TTE): [**2150-9-24**] at 10:01:00 AM Echocardiographic Measurements Results  Measurements  Normal Range Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  *6.0 cm  <= 5.2 cm Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  *6.1 cm  <= 5.0 cm Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  55%  >= 55% TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP):  21 mm Hg  <= 25 mm Hg  Findings This study was compared to the prior study of [**2144-10-2**].
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-10-2**], mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is no longer appreciated.
EGD ([**2150-9-25**]): Indications: 75 yo with recent ERCP/sphx had melena and upper GIbleed FINDINGS: Esophagus:  Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology to evaluate for H.pylori.
Other Duodenoscope was introduced and the site of previous sphincterotomy.

While awaiting this study, he received the following infusions: 6L NS IV, 4 units pRBCs, 1 units FFP, and 10mg vitamin K in order to reverse an INR of 2.4.
His hematocrit was followed closely and continued to trend up over the course of his MICU stay so he was transferred to the floor.
His blood pressure remained stable throughout his MICU stay.
TTE was done and showed stable EF and no effusion.
# Atrial fibrillation/flutter: INR was supratherapeutic in setting of coumadin at presentation .Patient appears to have slow atrial flutter, per EP, and does not require EP intervention at this time.
Plans to have INR drawn the week of [**2150-9-28**] with results sent to his nurse at his anticoagulation lcinic in FL.
# Portacaval lesion: First noted on CT in [**2149**].
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Full code - f/u pending EGD biopsies - f/u H Pylori, treat if positive - Repeat EGD in 4 weeks to evaluate healing and rule out malignancy - Re-initiation of coumadin on [**2150-9-28**] - goal INR [**2-6**] - Continued workup of portocaval mass   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from Patient.
TraMADOL (Ultram) 50 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 9.
TraMADOL (Ultram) 50 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 10.
You were found to have a low blood count and blood in your stool.
You were given blood transfusions and your blood count remained stable.
You had an upper endoscopy which showed a large ulcer in your intestines which was not actively bleeding, but we believe this was the source of your bleeding.
You will need a repeat endoscopy in 4 weeks to recheck the ulcer to make sure it is healing.
