CIWA was 17 with last drink approximately 72 hours prior.
His MICU course was notable for an echocardiogram which showed a large pericardial effusion on [**1-29**].
Past Medical History: - epilepsy and nonelectrographic seizures (petite mal with rare secondary generalization) - s/p right temporal lobectomy - s/p VNS placement - Mood disorder and likely borderline personality organization - Multiple suicide attempts in past (largely overdose) - DM due to medication, now apparently resolved - cervical strain - Rosacea - [**Last Name (un) 865**] esophagus - Polysubstance abuse: EtOH, MJ, cocaine/crack binges with resultant unsafe sexual practices - h/o atrial fibrillation (not on medication)  Social History: Unemployed, lives alone.
Smokes 1pk/day, occasional ETOH and OMR records indicate some history of Crack Cocaine use.
CARD: Soft heart sound, RRR, s1/s2 present, no m/g/r, with pericardial window draining frank blood ABD: +bs, soft, NT/ND EXT: wwp, no edema, 2+PD bilaterally SKIN: warm BACK: tenderness to palpation along the spine NEURO: AOx3, agitated, but agreeable.

-Urine cx [**1-29**]: neg -Pericardial fluid culture [**1-29**]: NGTD, but pending as of transfer to MICU -Pericardial fluid cytology: PND  STUDIES: .
ECHO [**2196-1-28**]: .
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Increased IVC diameter (>2.1cm) with 35-50% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (10-15mmHg).
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Poor image quality.The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg with IVC dilation (2.5 cm).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears mildly depressed.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Cardiac cath [**1-29**]: COMMENTS: Under fluoroscopic guidance, 450 CC of bloody pericardial fluid was obtained through subxiphoid approach.
Initial pericardial pressure was elevated at 21 mm Hg and dropped to 3 mm Hg after remorval of fluid.
ECHO [**2196-1-30**] IMPRESSION: Small amount of echodense pericardial material/fluid is seen.
Compared with the prior studies (images reviewed) of [**2196-1-29**] and [**2194-7-23**], the appearance of the pericardium is similar to that of the post-tap echo yesterday.
The right ventricle appears dilated on studies from yesterday and today - it was probably normal in [**2194**].
The bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and right popliteal veins demonstrated normal compressibility and wall-to-wall color flow.
CT TORSO [**2196-2-1**] (PRELIM) 1.
Pulmonary embolism involving right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] posterior basal segmental and subsegmental branches, and subsegmental branch of left lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] anterior basal pulmonary artery.
Intraabdominal findings include aortic and iliac artery calcifications, colonic diverticulosis, and tiny bubble of gas within the urinary bladder, which could be due to recent catheterization (correlate clinically).
CT HEAD [**2-2**] No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Etiology is likely malignancy given that CT torso showing RUL lung spiculated nodule.
# PE/DVT:  Pt noted to have enlarged RV on repeat echo [**1-31**], so CTA was obtained for concern of PEs which confirmed b/l subsegmental PEs.
Urine output was monitored and foley ended up being replaced on [**2-2**] given that he was put back into 4pt restraints.
In addition, you were found to have a pericardial effusion (fluid around your heart) which is likely due to spreading of lung cancer, which was discovered on a CT scan.
You were seen by the oncologists here who recommended that you go to clinic for follow up to discuss further workup and treatment.
