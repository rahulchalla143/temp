PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2119-6-10**] 9:18 AM 1) Multiple loops of dilated small bowel, with air in the colon, concerning for early or partial small-bowel obstruction.
If clinical concern for free air remains high, then further assessment with upright or decubitus views or with a CT scan would be recommended.

Samples from both drains were obtained for culture/sensitivity/gram stain  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-6-13**] 10:31 PM  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is evidence of a right upper quadrant drain.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-6-14**] 5:06 PM Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-6-15**] 10:30 AM  As compared to the previous image, there is a mild increase in extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-6-16**] 2:32 AM  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-6-17**] 4:31 AM As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in extent of a left retrocardiac atelectasis.
Today's radiograph shows evidence of minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, suggesting the presence of a left pleural effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-6-18**] 12:38 PM As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pigtail catheter in the pleural space is in unchanged position.
RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2119-6-18**] 3:07 PM The right kidney measures 12.8 cm, and the left kidney measures 12.5 cm.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-6-19**] 10:05 AM As compared to the previous radiograph, the pleural effusions bilaterally have not substantially changed.
Moderate cardiomegaly, moderate retrocardiac atelectasis  BILIARY CATH CHECK Study Date of [**2119-6-20**] 1:26 PM 1.
Pull-back cholangiogram demonstrating patent metallic stent on the left, however a significant narrowing remains superior to the stent.
BILIARY CATH CHECK Study Date of [**2119-6-22**] 4:04 PM PRE-LIMINARY REPORT 1.
Balloon plasty and stenting of left biliary stricture.
Post-stenting cholangiogram demonstrating free flow of contrast from the periphery of the left hepatic biliary system into the small bowel.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 yo male with HCV and recent imaging studies concerning for HCC vs CC vs combination, s/p IR guided biliary drainage and PTC drain placement, presenting with hemoperitoneum and distended abdomen.
Specimens were sent for cytology brushings.
The cultures were subsequently positive for Klebsiella and Enterobacter.
His final cholangiogram demonstrated a patent biliary system.
#Septic shock: Two days postop on the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name 679**] service, the patient was in mild abdominal pain and found to have features of SIRS (WBC 21, temp 99.2, HR 110s) and modest rise in LFTs.
Cultures of the bile and pleural fluid grew Klebsiella and Enterobacter resistant to Unasyn and Zosyn.
1 blood culture grew GP rods which they were unable to speciate due to loss of viability.
Safety labs were prescribed to the VNA to be drawn on [**2119-6-28**] and the results will be faxed to the liver center.
Repeat CXR showed a R sided pleural effusion which was tapped by interventional pulmonology.
The patient acutely developed hypoxia, rigors, and tachycardia during which blood cultures were drawn.
The right drain was removed, and the left drain was exchanged and kept to hold access.
The patient's serum creatinine was noted to be elevated on his last day in the ICU, in part due to pre-renal causes (poor po intake) and possible contrast-induced nephropathy in light of multiple IR-take backs.
The patient's white count was acutely elevated and he was re cultured.
