[**2169-1-10**] CPK 10  AST 26  ALT 6  AlkPh 135  Tb 1.4   Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis presented with biliary sepsis.
# Sepsis/Biliary obstruction/Liver abscesses: At the OSH she was hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial bacteremia, with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC, and VRE from blood cultures.
Had negative UA/Urine culture and CXR for pneumonia.
Source is biliary, with additional concern for liver abscess on CT scan.
The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed in the anterior portion of the left lobe.
At the time of discharge, several blood cultures remain pending, please follow up final results.
Please follow INR and titrate coumadin dosing as appropriate.
# Left lower extremity DVT: The patient was noted to have right>left lower extremity swelling so lower extremity dopplers were obtained which showed a probable thrombus of a deep vein of the left calf, likely one of the paired posterior tibial veins.
The patient was started on a heparin gtt with a goal PTT of 50-70, and then transitioned to Lovenox/coumadin.
ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to [**2169-1-3**] demonstrated a change in axis and co-incides with chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in one of the consultant notes.
ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and maintainance of new axis since [**1-2**]--cycled enzymes; Trp 0.05 but CK-Mb remained negative.
A TTE was obtained which showed an EF of >55%, but elevated PCWP.
She had an NGT placed, which she self-d/c'd.
