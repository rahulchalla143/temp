CCT [**2138-9-14**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Over the next 24 hrs she titrated off pressors with blood pressures in the 90-100's.
CCT was done and revealed left-sided pneumonia.
With aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs, incentive spirometer her oxygenation improved 94% on 3-4L nasal cannula.
On [**2129-9-11**] the chest film showed residual right fluid collection for which a chest tube was placed and drained 260 cc of serosanguinous fluid then removed on [**2138-9-12**].
Chest films: she was followed by serial chest films which showed slowly improving left pulmonary alveolar opacity.
Once the hypotension resolved she remained hemodynamically stable with blood pressures of 110-140's.
