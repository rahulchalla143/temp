Please note that the study is somewhat suboptimal due to non-breath hold technique.
Given the spiculated right lung mass, an evaluation with a dynamic CT is recommended to exclude metastatic disease involving the adrenal gland.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
With her epigastric tenderness, a troponin of 0.41, and shortness of breath, her exact diagnosis was unclear.
A GI consult was obtained for a possible ERCP after an MRCP revealed cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
It was determined that with her overall condition (MDS, CAD) and improving exam, an ERCP was not indicated at this time.
You had an MRCP scan which showed that you do not have a blockage or infection of your gallbladder, but that you do have gall stones.
Your pain improved and your liver enzymes are markedly decreasing without any invasive intervention.
