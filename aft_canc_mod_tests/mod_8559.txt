Micro: Urine cx [**2130-3-29**]: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2130-3-31**]):       YEAST.
urine culture [**4-1**]: 10,000-100,000 yeast  Images: [**2130-3-31**] CXR Pa/lat: UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There are low inspiratory lung volumes.
Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.
Bibasilar opacities are noted, slightly worse on the right compared to the prior study, which may reflect atelectasis.
CT abd/pelvis without contrast [**2130-3-31**]: Evaluation of visceral organs is limited due to lack of intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE PELVIS [**2130-3-31**]: Moderate amount of fluid within the pelvis is unchanged.
Grade 1 anterolisthesis involving L4-L5 is unchanged.
Echo [**2130-2-14**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Lower extremity dopplers - negative DVT  .
Venous ultrasound [**2130-2-15**]: FINDINGS: Waveforms of the subclavian veins are symmetric bilaterally.
On the left, the internal jugular vein is notable for isoechoic endoluminal contents and that vessel is incompletely compressible and shows only partial flow on color Doppler analysis, consistent with non-occlusive thrombus.
EKG: Old t wave inversion in I and AVL   Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old woman who presented from [**Hospital3 **] for high INR (5.3), HCT of 16.9, and no clear source of bleeding.
The HCT drop was from 25.7 to 16.9 in 2 days.
CT torso showed no evidence of internal bleeding.
She had persistent pyuria in urine and several cultures showed yeast.
Her discharge was delayed because of hyperkalemia and her discharge potassium was 5.0.
Her home lasix was held at nursing facility but we increased the dose as she had severe edema up to the chest wall and hypoalbuminemia (anasarca; bilateral pleural efusions and ascites).
We stopped the Losartan, Clonidine and Hydralazine and increased the Metoprolol and she remained normotensive.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with anemia (low red blood count) and abnormal labs that showed your blood was too thin.
A CT scan showed no sign of bleeding in your abdomen, and your stool was also negative for blood.
The blood thinner (that you were previously taking for the clot in your arm) has been stopped.
You should see a GI specialist to further evaluate and follow-up these findings.
