Impression: Mild melanosis in the sigmoid colon Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: poor prep - will need routine screening [**Last Name (un) **] as outpatient.
Pt was given 2U RBCs in the ICU with initial HCT of 24.4 (baseline around 40).
GI decided to do EGD and colonoscopy both of which did not reveal a site of active bleeding (see reports above).
The evening before discharge, verapamil was restarted at home dose of 180mg PO BID and pt's HR and BP were well controlled.days.
A nasogastric lavage did not show any blood.
You had a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy (EGD) done.
Your blood counts remained stable after you came to the floor and we felt comfortable having you return home and to come back to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) **] to have a [**Location (un) 87517**] endoscopy to further evaluate for the bleeding.
Your verapamil was held in the hospital because of your low blood pressure in the ICU but we restarted it prior to discharge.
Please continue to take your verapamil to control heart rate but do not take aspirin until your GI appointment.
