<b>Radiologic Data: CXR [**10-3**]:  Mild cardiomegaly, low lung volumes, but no evidence for pneumonia.
PFTs [**4-/2112**]: Reduced FVC (72%) and Dsb (63%) with low-normal TLC suggests a restrictive process.
Echo [**3-/2112**]: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF> 55%).
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal LV filling pressure.
Her physical exam was unremarkable for CHF - she had no peripheral edema, no JVD and her lungs were clear bilaterally.
was not on outpatient anticoagulation), there was significant concern for a PE.
Her elevated creatinine did not allow for a CTA so a VQ scan was performed and was highly suspcious for a PE with multiple perfusion deficits.
Additionally, an echo showed depressed RV function and evidence of RV hypertrophy and LE dopplers showed a DVT in her right popliteal artery.
The evidence of RV hypertrophy and multiple VQ mismatches suggested an acute and chronic thromboembolic disease.
By time of discharge, she maintained normal oxygen saturation on room air.

CK = 89 and Trop = 0.07.
She was continued on ASA 81 mg. Metoprolol 12.5 was added once her BP could tolerate it.
However, on exam her lung exam was unremarkable and she had no peripheral edema.
Her CXR was also unremarkable.
Blood and urine cultures are still pending, but show no growth.
Her BP meds (Diltiazem and Lisinopril) were held, but a Metoprolol 12.5 was started on [**10-5**] because her blood pressure had improved and because of her cardiac risk factors.
4 Acute Renal Failure: Admission Cr was 3.4 and her baseline Cr is 1.1.
Her creatinine trended downward for the remainder of her hospitalization.
FS were done QID with humalog/SSI until all blood sugars were normal.
