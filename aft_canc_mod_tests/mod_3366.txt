There was some suspicion for tamponade on exam because of pulsus alternans noticed on telemetry.
His heart sounds were muffled with elevated JVP and sinus tachycardia.
A stat bedside echo was performed that was negative for effusion.
<br><br><B>PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:</B> ======================== - [**2147**]: diagnosed with left renal cell carcinoma and underwent nephrectomy.
- [**2151**]: moved to US - [**10/2157**]: CXR showed a "spot" on his right lung.
serial CT scans showed growth of this lesion (1->3.5cm).
- [**1-/2159**]: PET-CT showed multiple foci of uptake in right lung, and subcarinal adenopathy and right liver lesion.
CT showed a 4.4 x 2.7cm right lower lobe lesion and right hilar lymphadenopathy and 7.6cm low density liver lesion.
Core biopsy showed adenocarcinoma (CK-7 and 20 positive, TTF-1 negative).
Bone scan showed abnormality in T10.
MRI brain showed an enlarged pituitary consistent with macroadenoma, but metastasis could not be ruled out.
- Treated to Dubai with alternative therapies until [**Month (only) 1096**] [**2159**] - [**Date range (2) 74388**]: Back at [**Hospital1 **] with CTA revealing marked progression of disease and new right adrenal metastasis.
Bone scan [**2160-2-13**] with known T10 lesion.
bronchoscopy with mechanical resection of tumor in the RLL and RML.
<br> [**2160-4-18**] CT HEAD: 1.
No evidence of major vascular territorial infarct, although MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging remains more sensitive for this indication.
Expanded sella with enlarged pituitary gland is better evaluated on MRI brain performed [**2159-8-15**] and is unchanged since that time.
CT head negative for metastatsis.
Patient had this event in the setting of a bowel movement, which would suggest vasovagal activity.
Tamponade was also suspected because pt had pulsus alternans and a pulsus of 15 as well as distant heart sounds.
A stat bedside echo showed no effusion.
Patient was monitored on telemetry for 24 hours with no events.
Transthoracic echo was within normal limits.
Cultures remained negative.
CXR has been negative, although may this may be due to viral syndrome or bacterial etiology.
You recieved a blood transfusion and felt much  better afterward.
