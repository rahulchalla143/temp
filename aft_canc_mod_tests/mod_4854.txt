A UA and CXR were obtained on [**12-16**], which were both negative for an infectious process.
He became increasingly difficult to arouse on [**12-16**] in the evening, and a head CT was obtained which demosntrated no acute change.

CXR [**12-16**]: No acute process  CXR [**12-17**]: Lungs are clear.
CXR [**12-29**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight increase in extent of the pre-existing left pleural effusion.
As a consequence, the left retrocardiac atelectasis, resulting in lung parenchymal consolidation, has also slightly increased.
# Brain Lesions: Pathology result of brain biopsy revealed B cell lymphoma.
# PNA: given leukocytosis, fever, and increased work of breathing with LLL infiltrate on CXR consistent with PNA.
His MS improved with IVF and resolution of his hypotension although he still remained somewhat disoriented, worsening at night.
# DLBC CNS Lymphoma: Patient underwent stereotactic biopsy of right frontal lesion on [**12-14**] showing DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA.
He was transferred to Medicine-Oncology service for initiation of methotrexate therapy, which he received [**2168-12-27**] and tolerated well except for mild mucositis.
MRI spine was obtained on [**1-1**], read pending.
He will need a double lumen port placed and eye exam done prior to his next admission for chemotherapy.
Received IV Lasix 10mg X2 with subsequent good urine output and improvement in oxygenation.
Hematocrit has been trending down.
Also likely marrow suppression from recent illness as retic count was 1.0.
His bilirubin was within normal limits.
Baseline creatinine is 1.1.
Patient's creatinine bumped to 1.4 on [**12-28**].
Renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction; however, a post-void residual showed that showed he was retaining urine.
