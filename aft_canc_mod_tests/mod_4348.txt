In the ED he was noted to be febrile to 102 but hemodynamically stable with a Creatinine of 2.1, leukocytosis of 23.1.
CT scan of the head and neck and CTA revealed subcutaneous inflammatory changes, subgaleal soft tissue edema, right greater than left, extending into the right preauricular and preseptal areas and neck down to the level of the thyroid, but no evidence of drainable fluid collection, subcutaneous emphysema, gas formation, or thrombus.
On [**3-7**] he was weaned off pressors, and his white count decreased, but he developed atrial fibrillation with a regular ventricular rate but with resulting hypotension, and so was started on amiodarone.
His cultures from [**3-2**] in the blood at [**Location (un) 620**] grew Group A beta hemolytic strep; his wound cultures on [**3-4**] grew out staph coag negative and [**3-5**], [**3-6**], grew group A beta-hemolytic strep.
The erythema on his chest continued to spread, however, and so he was given one dose of vancomycin and then placed on linezolid for its toxin-fighting effects, with discontinuation of clindamycin, per ID.
On [**3-10**] he was thought to be moving the right hand less than the left, and so given his previous periods of hypotension he underwent a NCHCT, that was negative for acute infarct.
On [**3-11**] his WBC rose to 24 from 16.7 and so given concern for alternate sources of infection he was checked for C dif, his CVL was changed, a UA was negative, and CXR showed b/l pleural effusions.
In the setting of persistent oozing he was transfused four units of pRBC on [**3-14**] for a Hct of 20 down from 28.
On [**3-18**] repeat speech and swallow recommended thin liquids, pureed foods, and pills with pureed foods and supervision.
He should have LFTs and thyroid function tests done in one week.
His NPH was decreased to 15 [**Hospital1 **] from 30 [**Hospital1 **] when his diet was changed from tube feeds to PO intake.
