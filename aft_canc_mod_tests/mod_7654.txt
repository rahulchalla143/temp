Of note, he was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs in [**3-/2105**] at the time of his CEA for Hct 23.4, and was transfused an additional 2 units of PRBCs last week at [**Hospital 4068**] hospital, Hct unclear.

An NG lavage was performed, which was negative (no return of bile).
INR returned at 1.9, and he was given Vitamin K 5 mg SC X1, and FFP X2 units.
His hematocrit also returned at 26.5, and he was transfused 2 units of PRBCs, without improvement and with further drop in Hct to 23.
DM type 2, last HbA1c on file 7.7 in [**5-/2104**] 4.
Persantine MIBI in [**2-/2105**] with reversible, small, mild perfusion defect involving the LAD territory and transient cavity dilation.

Relevant imaging data: [**2105-6-11**] Colonoscopy: Normal mucosa in the whole colon.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 94500**] is an 83 year-old male with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with INR 1.9, CAD on ASA, DM type 2, with prior GI bleeding without a clear source identified, admitted to the ICU with a 1-day history of maroon stools with Hct drop.
1) GI bleed: As noted above, an NG lavage performed in the ED was negative for blood, but limited by lack of bilious return.
His hematocrit nadir was 24, and he was admitted to the ICU for further care.
GI was consulted, and a push enteroscopy was performed on [**2105-6-11**], remarkable for Barrett's esophagus, and polyps in the antrum and stomach body, one of which was ulcerated with stigmata of recent bleeding.
A colonoscopy was unremarkable.
Recommendation was made to proceed with a repeat upper endoscopy on [**6-16**] (with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 172**] for polypectomy.
His ASA and Coumadin will remain on hold until that time.
His hematocrit at discharge was 30.2.
2) CAD: His EKG in the ED was at baseline, and he was ruled out with serial cardiac biomarkers.
His Diltiazem, which was transiently held, was resumed prior to discharge.
His Coumadin remains on hold at the time of discharge pending repeat upper endoscopy.
5) Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: His creatinine on admission was 1.5, up from a baseline of 1.2 in 04/[**2104**].
His creatinine improved with volume expansion, ultimately attributed to pre-renal azotemia.
Hematocrit at discharge 30.2.
You are scheduled for a repeat endoscopy on Tuesday [**2105-6-16**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 172**].
