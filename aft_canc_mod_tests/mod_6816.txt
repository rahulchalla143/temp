Ultrasound of abdomen on admission shows new ascites.
Culture done on the fluid revealed E coli.
Following the paracentsis he was transferred to the SICU for hypotension to the 80's most likely due to SBP On [**11-3**] he underwent a gall bladder scan which showed findings consistent with a bile leak and was sent on [**11-4**] for ERCP.
He had a bare metal stent placed on his previous admission once he was found to be unresectable.
Large volumes were being drained daily of [**2-12**] Liters.
The drain was removed  on [**11-8**] and insertion sutured, with no leak.
At the current time of discharge the plan is to keep patient off diuretics with monitoring of his labs and reinstitution once the kidney function improves.
