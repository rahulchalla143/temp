Admission Date:  [**2182-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-8-12**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**] Chief Complaint: Fall and SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: 89yo CM with PMHx significant for CAD s/p incomplete atherectomy and PCA ([**1-27**]), and recent echo ([**7-27**]) demonstrating CHF (EF: 25-30%), moderate AS (valve area 1.0), mild->mod AR, mod MR, mod TR, and mild pulm artery systolic HTN as [**Doctor Last Name **] as DM2, and CKI (baseline Cr ?2-2.7) who was admitted to the ICU for managment of altered mental status in the setting of hypervolemic hyponatremia.
In the ED he was awake and responsive and his initial vitals were 97.4, 82, 137/89, 16, 91% on 3L NC, but throughout the next couple of hours he became unresponsive and was found to be hyponatremic to 118.
Head CT was negative.
He was placed on a lasix drip and diuresed about 6L, taking into consideration the need to not decrease his preload in the setting of AS in order to maintain his CO. Renal was consulted for his elevated Cr, which occurred likely secondary to poor forward flow state and suggested an SPEP/UPEP, which was negative for Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] protein.
His Toresmide was restarted and a Heart Failure consult was requested.

Head CT ([**7-28**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
CXR ([**7-28**]): IMPRESSION: Increased size of right pleural effusion, now moderate, with persistent small left pleural effusion.
ECHO ([**7-29**]): Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-4-10**], biventricular systolic function is more depressed suggesting a diffuse process.
Cardiac Cath ([**8-6**]): COMMENTS: 1.
Angiography of the left circumflex demonstrated a 40% proximal stenosis and a 70% stenosis at the ostium of the OM1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right heart filling pressures with a mean PCW of 35 mmHg and RVEDP of 11 mmHg.
There was moderate systemic arterial hypertension with SBP 152 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved (3.5 l/min/m2).
Moderate to severe pulmonary arterial systolic and diastolic hypertension 5.
ECHO ([**8-7**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-7-29**], the severity of valvular regurgitation is slighlty less.
CXR ([**8-10**]): IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in CHF with persistent bilateral pleural effusions.
MICROBIOLOGY: Urine Cx ([**8-3**]):    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2182-8-3**]):       PROTEUS MIRABILIS.

Head CT showed no evidence of acute intracranial process.
His serum sodium improved with diuresis and free water restriction to 1.5L/day.
#Aortic Stenosis: Moderate AS with valve area 1.0-1.2cm2 on ECHO [**2182-8-7**].
We remained cogniscent of the patient's vavular disease throughout our managment of his volume overload; we were careful to not over-diurese the patient in order to keep his preload appropriate to maintain adequate cardiac output.
Cardiac cath was performed on [**8-6**] as mentioned above with 3 stents placed in his highly diseased LAD.
His lisinopril decreased to 2.5mg daily.
He would sat between 88-92% on RA when at rest, but any exertion would drop his sats 80% if on RA.
A CT Head in ED revealed no trauma or ICH.
His blood sugar levels were reasonably controlled although the sliding scale was kept conservate due to patient's age and general poor health.
Moisturizing cream applied to LE.
You were taken to the cardiac catheterization lab and found to have multiple blockages in one of your heart arteries - 3 stents were placed in this artery to improve your blood flow.
