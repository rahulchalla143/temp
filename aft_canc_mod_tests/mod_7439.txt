[**11-11**] Head CT 1.
She had an MRI of the brain that showed a large 4.7 cm rounded lesion in the right posterior fossa, with significant mass effect on the right cerebellum, and causing leftward midline shift.
Blood pressure parameter were SBP goal 100 - 140.
The drain stopped functioning on [**11-2**] in the pm and a CT revealed that it was not in the ventricle.
Her EVD was at 10cm H2O and it was well functioning overnight into [**11-5**] and she had no neurologic issues.
A post-operative head CT was done which was unremarkable.
She underwent MRI of the brain on [**11-5**] which showed no residual mass and persistent effacement of the 4th ventricle.
On [**11-8**] she had a stable head CT and her EVD was clamped but failed her clamping trial and the EVD was opened for increased ICP's however she had no change in her clinical exam and only minor headaches.
On [**11-9**] her ICP's transiently was greater than 20 but was asymptomatic and her EVD was clamped at 1400.
On [**11-11**] her EVD was removed without incident following a stable head CT after beign clamped for over 24 hours and she was transferred to floor status.
