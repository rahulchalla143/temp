She was given 2L IVFs, started on po flagyl empirically for c. diff adn had stool cultures sent for possible OIs.
Upon vitals check at 0400, pt's BP noted to be 78/54, HR 98, RR 20s, O2 sat 86% RA --> 93% 3L NC.
Given 500 cc IVF bolus X 2 with response in SBP to 86/40s, however, RR rose to upper 20-30s with O2 sats 90% 6L NC --> 95% NRB.
ABG 7.51/25/114/21.
CXR revealed likely pulmonary edema with worsening bilateral pleural effusions and possible retrocardiac opacity.
Repeat biopsy showed persistent DCIS, and she underwent left mastectomy on [**2160-9-20**].
More recently, a CT of the chest noted ground-glass abnormalities, raising concern for bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
In [**2-/2182**] liver function studies were noted to be elevated, and liver ultrasound and abdominal CT showed numerous lesions in the liver.
CT-guided core liver biopsy on [**2182-2-25**] showed metastatic breast adenocarcinoma staining positive for mammoglobin, negative for GCDFP, ER, and PR.
Tumor markers drawn on [**2182-2-18**] were elevated with CEA 20 ng/mL and CA 27.29 278 u/mL.
PET scan performed on [**2182-3-6**] showed numerous heterogeneous liver lesions, sclerotic lesions in the left anterior rib and right ilium that were FDG avid and concerning for metastatic foci, and FDG avid left pelvic side wall lymph node.
On [**2182-3-20**] mammogram and ultrasound of the right breast showed a 1.9-cm right breast nodule.
Pathology from a core breast biopsy showed invasive ductal carcinoma grade I that was HER-2/neu negative and ER/PR positive.
Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**], therefore, appears to have a new right breast tumor that is ER/PRpositive, HER-2/neu negative, and liver metastases that are ER/PR negative and HER-2/neu positive.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-3-19**], biventricular systolic funciton is now significantly depressed.
CXR: Comparison is made with prior study [**2182-5-10**].
DDx for the infection included the gut (given diarrhea) vs the lung vs other.
TTE revealed decreased LVEF confirming the suspicion of acute heart failure in the setting of sepsis.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Hypoxia progressed relatively rapidly in the setting of receiving IVFs, CXR with evidence supporting pulmonary edema.
# Pancytopenia: likely [**2-4**] chemotherapy - neutropenic, anemic w underlying combined iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease.
