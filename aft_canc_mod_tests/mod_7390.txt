As patient was being worked up in ED for spinal cord compression, patient became extremely hypotensive to systolic blood pressures to 70s-80s.
Patient was felt to be in bacterial sepsis and empirically started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone which was later changed to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin when blood cultures were positive for gram negative rods X [**3-1**].

A Port-A-Cath device has its tip in the central most SVC.
Wound culture and gram stain yielded no organisms.
Tip culture was not performed.
By hospital day 4, blood cultures speciated Serratia with a high possibility of developing resistance to third generation cephalosporins, and so antibiotics were changed to ciprofloxacin and cefepime, and vancomycin was discontinued.
Consideration was given to decreasing patient's dose of coumadin given her antibiotic therapy, however, at the time of discharge, patient's INR was 1.6, and it was felt that patient would likely reach therapeutic range during the week before returning to clinic.
Medications on Admission: 1) Vicodin 2) Protonix 3) Lisinopril 4) Effexor 5) Warfarin, 6) Toprol 7) Lasix 8) Ativan 9) Decadron   Discharge Medications: 1.
