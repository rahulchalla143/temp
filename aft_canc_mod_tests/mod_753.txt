While in the ED, patient was given IV metronidazole (given bowel pathology concerns) and IV levofloxacin 750mg (had been on in community) and initially patient was apparently singing in Creole and not responding to questioning and since then nursing staff and family have noted fluctuating level of consciousness with him speaking albeit confused with eyes open intermixed with episodes of unresponsiveness, eyes rolling and associated with blowing out cheeks motions of mouth (?
This was associated with tachycardia to 130s and following lorazepam HR dropped to 90s-100s.
Per records last seizure was in [**2138-2-12**] when he had twitching on right side of his face and arm and prior semiologies have included EPC admission in [**2136**] with abnormal tongue movements.
Patient was recently admitted under surgery and discharged [**2138-5-23**] after abdominal pain with chronic constipation issues and stenosis of distal sigmoid colon and improved with laxatives with a CT on admission did not show any acute process.
EEG at the time showed periodic beta frequency rhythmic spike activity in the frontocentral regions that correlated with rhythmic movements of the mouth consistent with myoclonus.
MRI of the head that showed chronic small vessel ischemic changes, but no acute pathological abnormality.
- Right hemicolectomy in [**2123**] for colon cancer-s/p chemo with multiple SBO's ([**3-19**], [**4-19**], [**5-19**], [**7-19**]), then LOA [**9-19**], complicated by peritonitis s/p Abx - Chronic L common femoral vein thrombosis and IVC thrombosis s/p  IVC filter placement - Osteoporosis - Cholecystectomy - B/l small inguinal hernias   Social History: He is [**Location 7972**] speaking.
About 10-15 minutes after giving 1mg IV lorazepam patient had woken up more and was GCS E3-4 V3 (occasional understandable word in Haitian creole per family otherwise incomprehensible) and M6 was able to squeeze my fingers and tried to protrude tongue on command.
Funduscopic exam reveals no evidence of papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages but difficult to assess retina in a more detailed fashion due to patient cooperation.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch with moving face when touched.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2138-5-22**] there is no diagnostic change.

[**2138-6-9**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2138-6-10**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of a mild diffuse encephalopathy.
Wedge compression fracture deformities of the L1 and L3 vertebral bodies are unchanged.
Latterly somnolent again following Keppra load and lorazepam but grimacing all 4 limbs and some purposeful movement to noxious bilaterally in setting of returned tachycardia up to 140s requiring IV diltiazem which then settled to 80s and hemodynamically stable.
CXR shows bilateral atelectasis.
CT head shows no acute ischemic changes but significant atrophy and old left corona radiata lacune.
AXR showed concern for possible SBO but CT abdomen shows possible ileus but no evidence of obstruction on prelim read.
He was placed on EEG from [**Date range (1) 18468**] and monitored.
His chest xray did show some atelectasis and ?
Initial KUB was abnormal and a CT abdomen pelvis was performed.
Surgery consult noted that there was no acute surgical issue and that the CT was negative for a small bowel obstruction.
He was initially kept NPO, repeat AXR was performed and showed some improvement.
His renal function has improved throughout hospital course with his creatinine now 1.1.
Avoid quinolones or flagyl if possible as these lower seizure threshold.
