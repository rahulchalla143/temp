His dyspnea worsened earlier today and he presented to [**Hospital3 2783**], a chest xray showed cardiomegaly and an echo was done which showed pericardial effusion.
His VS in ED were 96.7, 135, 188/118, 30, 100%NRB.
CT Chest r/o PE, dissection.
INR was 3.3.
A CTA confirmed the presence of a large pericardial effusion as well as an anterior mediastinal mass.
An echo showed right ventricular collapse and  less than 20% LVEF.
Cardiac catheterization was performed for pericardiocentesis; 1020 ccs of straw-colored fluid was drawn out, with an immediate relief of symptoms.
Follow-up echo confirmed successful drainage.

TTE (Focused views) Done [**2139-4-11**] at 7:20:07 AM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a large, circumferentially, partially echo filled pericardial effusion extending 3cm inferolateral and lateral to the left ventricle and anterior to the right atrium, 1.5cm around the left ventricular apex and 1.0cm anterior to the right ventricle.
[**2139-4-11**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a large heterogeneous anterior mediastinal mass containing central coarse calcifications and areas of cystic change.
CT evidence of right heart failure.
CT LUNG/MEDIASTINAL BX Study Date of [**2139-4-14**] 2:32 PM PATHOLOGY [**2139-4-23**] I) Subpectoral nodule (A-B): Adenocarcinoma involving fibroadipose tissue.
Additionally, cytology was sent on pleural fluid, drawn by thoracentesis.
This was puzzling, given the clinical history, and given that a follow-up CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed no liver metastases or abdominal lymphadenopathy.
Repeat ECHO prior to discharge showed resolution of the pericardial effusion.
Additionally, it appeared that for a time Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 4143**] was effectively dehydrated because of the extensive extravasation associated with his full-torso rash; IV hydration did help to reduce heart rate during this time.
A skin biopsy was also consistent with drug rash.

Outpatient Lab Work INR - please have your INR checked next week before your appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19339**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial effusion Malignant mediastinal mass Atrial Fibrillation Drug Rash   Discharge Condition: Amublating, tolerating POs   Discharge Instructions: You had fluid build-up in your lungs and around your heart, which was drained.
One biopsy performed showed evidence for adenocarcinoma, which was an unexpected finding.
A colonoscopy was performed, as were further biopsies, the results of which are pending.
You will be discharged with Lovenox, an injectible blood thinner, to be taken with your coumadin until your INR, or Coumadin levels are within the therapeutic range.
