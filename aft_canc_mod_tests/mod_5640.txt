The patient was initially diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer after banging his head in [**2104-5-7**].
In the Emergency Department, he was given one dose of [**Year (4 digits) **] for a low-grade fever; and in addition to the rash, thought possible cellulitis.
During the first four days of hospitalization, the patient developed progressive azotemia, urinary retention, and hypotension with systolic blood pressures reaching the middle 70s.
Congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in [**2102**] showing an ejection fraction of 20% to 30%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination on admission to the Emergency Department revealed vital signs with a temperature of 100.7, blood pressure was 112/72, heart rate was 100, respiratory rate was 24.
On physical examination the patient was in mild discomfort, in no apparent respiratory distress.
His scalp was notable for frontal prominence with cavitation.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
He had 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses, and 2+ pitting edema in the bilateral left extremities.
His bilateral shins were notable for an erythematous maculopapular rash with shiny skin.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count was 4.9, hematocrit was 30.3, and platelets were 64.
INR was 2.7.
Sodium was 134, potassium was 4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 31, creatinine was 1, blood glucose was 123.
Urinalysis was within normal limits without any hematuria.
PERTINENT STUDIES DURING THIS ADMISSION:  Bilaterally lower extremity Doppler studies revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
A chest x-ray on [**2104-9-12**] (on admission) showed increased opacity in the region of the right hilum consistent with known right lung mass.
A CT of the chest on [**2104-9-16**] showed interval enlargement of obstruction in the right lower lobe lung mass with a collapse of superior segment as well as interval increase in bulk in right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
A CT of the head on [**2104-9-17**] was normal.
A CT of the cervical spine, and lumbar spine, and thoracic spine on [**2104-9-17**] was without evidence of metastatic involvement of the spinal canal or stenosis.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 67-year-old male with non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2104-5-7**] with metastases to skull and possibly the liver; status post aortic valve replacement secondary to rheumatic heart disease, on Coumadin, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and a history of gastrointestinal bleed presenting with cough times two weeks as well as lower extremity rash and pain following chemotherapy treatment on [**2104-9-2**].
During this hospitalization, an interval increase in the size of mass was noted by both a CT of the chest as well as increase in hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2104-9-19**] which demonstrated complete obstruction of the superior segment of the right lower lobe.
Although the patient was admitted with oxygen saturations of 98% on room air, he developed a oxygen requirement which began just prior to Intensive Care Unit admission.
A biopsy was performed which confirmed stasis changes.
A topical steroid was recommended, and the patient had good resolution of the lower extremity rash midway through his hospitalization.
Lower extremity Doppler studies were performed which were found to be negative.
With evidence of postobstructive pneumonia by chest x-ray and CT scan, additional antibiotics including clindamycin, Flagyl, and vancomycin were used intermittently.
No significant culture abnormalities were found with negative blood culture, sputum culture (which was contaminated), and a negative urine culture.
A CT scan of the cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbar spine was obtained and was found to have no evidence metastatic involvement or spinal stenosis.
A unifying diagnosis of carcinomatous meningitis was proposed; however, they diagnosis could not be fully assessed, as a magnetic resonance imaging could not be performed secondary to hardware from pacemaker in aortic valve.
A lumbar puncture was attempted on [**2104-9-17**]; however, the patient refused, and due to the patient's body habitus, history of lumbar surgery, and increased INR, another attempt was not considered.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  During his hospitalization, the patient had a repeat echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 25% to 35% with 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled during his admission which were negative times three.
An adrenal insufficiency workup was started secondary to the hypotension and was found to be negative with a random cortisol level of 18.
There was some concern for spinal metastasis; which were ruled out by a CT of the spine.
With intravenous fluid resuscitation, the patient's creatinine trended back to baseline and was 0.9 at the time of discharge; reconfirming that the patient's acute renal failure was secondary to prerenal causes.
At the time of discharge, the patient's urine output was appropriate and clear of gross blood.
He had been followed with serial hematocrits prior to hospitalization with hematocrit dropping as low as 27.
His INR reached as high as 6 and tended to stay between 4 and 5 during the majority of his hospitalization.
(with titration to a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5).
