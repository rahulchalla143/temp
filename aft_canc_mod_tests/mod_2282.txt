The patient was initially seen at [**Hospital **] Hospital for these symptoms and was found to have a bilirubin level of 32.4, and He subsequently underwent an abdominal ultrasound which was consistent with distal common bile duct obstruction and pancreatic ductal obstruction, though no definite lesion was seen.
The patient also underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography at the outside hospital which demonstrated a markedly dilated bile duct with a distal stricture.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation of his obstructive jaundice and possible surgical intervention.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Weight was 174 pounds, blood pressure was 126/70, heart rate was 80.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Hematocrit was 36.9, white blood cell count was 11.5.
Sodium was 136, potassium was 3.6, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was 26, creatinine was 1.2, blood glucose was 91.
AST was 111, ALT was 22, alkaline phosphatase was 442, total bilirubin was 45.3.
PT was 13.2, INR was 1.2, PTT was 34.9.
Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies were negative.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats per minute, and no evidence of ST changes.
A CT of the abdomen with intravenous contrast revealed (1) pancreatic head mass measuring 2.4 cm X 2.6 cm with minimal small peripancreatic lymph nodes and minimal stranding of the mesentery, grade 0 involvement of the superior mesenteric artery and probable grade 1 or 2 involvement of the superior mesenteric vein; (2) normal celiac access; (3) ascites; (4) findings suggestive of mild cirrhosis.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ([**2170-8-31**]) revealed (1) ampullary mass; (2) biliary dilatation compatible with distal obstruction; (3) stent placement in the common bile duct; (4) gastric mucosal changes consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy.
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and CT scan demonstrated a mass in the head of the pancreas consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Following the patient's CT scan, he developed an elevated creatinine to 2.4.
In addition, he also underwent a cholecystectomy, wedge liver biopsy, and transduodenal biopsy of the pancreas.
The liver wedge biopsy revealed chronic obstruction with marked bile stasis and active cholangiolitis as well as mild steatosis with prominent regeneration.
The pancreatic biopsy revealed invasive adenocarcinoma which was moderately differentiated.
His total bilirubin levels came down dramatically from 45.3 to 5.5 on the patient's day of discharge.
He was noted to have ascites both intraoperatively and on his CT scan of the abdomen.
Urinary sodium levels were followed to assess for adequate diuresis.
On postoperative day eight, fluid from the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was sent for cell count, cytology, and cultures.
The patient was found to have a white blood cell count of 6660 and 53% polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
His absolute neutrophil count was determined to be [**2108**]; which was consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
The culture from the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain fluid also grew out alpha streptococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As noted above, the patient was found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as suggested by the cell count and culture from the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain fluid.
He underwent a diagnostic paracentesis on [**2170-9-20**] for further evaluation of his ascites fluid.
The Gram stain revealed no evidence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes or microorganisms.
However, his white blood cell count was found to be 1775 with 42% polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
This also confirmed the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis since the patient's absolute neutrophil count was 911.
However, following the patient's CT scan with intravenous contrast, the patient developed an increase in his creatinine to 2.4.
Since that time, his creatinine has remained stable, and on the day of discharge his creatinine was 2.6.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed on postoperative day eight.
