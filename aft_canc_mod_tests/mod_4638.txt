Right lung peripheral opacities better evaluated in prior CT [**8-5**] and are unchanged.
[**2154-8-31**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) There has been markedly improved in right upper, right perihilar and right lower lobe opacities consistent with improving hemorrhage or aspiration.
[**2154-8-30**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube has been removed.
[**2154-8-30**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IMPRESSIONS: Extensive right central and upper lung airspace opacity, which may reflect hemorrhage from the recent procedure, or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
CXR ruled out PNA as a potentialy source of hypoxia, and the patient did not produce significant volumes of concentration of blood in the sputum concerning for tracheal bleed.
# Hct Drop: The patient presented with a Hct 44.7 and found to have a Hct of 33.1 post-operatively.
The low Hct is most likely attributable to fluids received during procedure and minimal blood loss, however given the 12 point drop, her lab values were followed and the Hct level was stable and began to rise without event or concern for chonic blood loss.
Hct 34.0->35.8 this AM.
# Non-Small Cell Lung CA: A new tracheal mass identified on CT in [**Month (only) **] was highly concerning for metastasis and likely to grow to occlude airway the airway, so surgical debridement was warranted with interventional pulmonology without intraoperative complications outside of apnea/hypoxia as elaborated on above.

In the MICU, your blood oxygen levels improved over the course of a day on supplemental oxygen and you were transitioned from a face-mask to a face-tent to a nasal cannula on supplementary oxygen.
When your oxygen levels stabilized, you were transferred to the inpatient floor, where you were eventually weaned off of supplementary oxygen.
You were breathing stable at your baseline blood oxygen levels on the inpatient floor at rest, but were found to be significantly short of breath with activity.
