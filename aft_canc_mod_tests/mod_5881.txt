Anemia: Her laboratories at OSH were consistent with but not diagnostic of hemolysis; she did not display signs of active bleeding.
The haptoglobin at [**Hospital1 18**] was elevated pointing against hemolysis.
A CT scan at [**Hospital1 18**] showed extensive clot burden in her portal system, likely related to her prior surgery.
Hemolysis labs were monitored as well as Cyclosporine levels.
LDH was persistently elevated likely secondary to abdominal clot process.
Abdominal Pain/Portal thrombus: The pain was diffuse, severe, and out of proportion to exam.
CT scan of abdomen did show large portal clot burden.
White count peaked at 36 and fell to 17.5 at time of discharge.
Acute Kidney Injury:  Creatinine 1.3 from baseline < 1.0.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
At the time of discharge, your blood counts were nearing the normal range.
A scan of your abdomen showed a large amount of blood clots in the vessels that drain your intestines.
Several changes were made to your medications: - cyclosporin has been reduced to 75mg twice daily - prednisone 30mg daily has been started - warfarin 5mg daily has been started - bactrim (single strength) has been started - omeprazole, paroxeteine, clonazepam, calcium/vitamin D, and folic acid have been continued at previous doses.
