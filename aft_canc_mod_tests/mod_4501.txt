Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of a 2.1 cm core biopsy of trabecular bone.
Special Stains: An iron stain performed on the core biopsy shows the presence of storage iron.
By outside report, a reticulin stain shows a mild increase in reticulin fibrosis.
PART II: SPECIMEN: LYMPH NODE, LEFT INGUINAL, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY (SLIDE CONSULT RECEIVED FROM [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL, [**Hospital1 **], [**Numeric Identifier 60185**], CONSISTING OF 9 SLIDES ALL LABELED "S10-1782" FROM PROCEDURE DATE [**2127-3-24**]) DIAGNOSIS: DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, SEE NOTE.
Immunohistochemical stain performed at [**Hospital6 13185**] on an additional piece of tissue from the same procedure date, shows that the large cells are strongly immunoreactive for pan B-cell marker CD20, are Lambda light chain restricted and co-express MUM-1 and BCL-2, but are negative for BCL-6 and CD10.
A CD3 stain highlights scattered background T-cells.
MIB-1 staining shows a proliferation index of 60%, consistent with a large cell lymphoma.
The above morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are those of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Pt had CT scan which did not show any apparent disease in the chest.
Pt had LP to eval for malignancy within the CNS which was negative for malignant cells.
Tumor lysis labs were monitored and were negative except for elevated LDH (pt did recieve allopurinol throughout C1).
Cell counts were monitored throughout hospital stay and will need to be followed after discharge.
-CONSIDER REPEAT TESTICULAR ULTRASOUND -PT WILL REQUIRE SECOND DOSE OF RITUXAN DURING 2ND CYCLE, DID NOT RECIEVE AS INPATIENT  2.
[**Name (NI) **] DVT - Pt noted to have DVT on admission to felt to be secondary to venous stasis from lymphatic obstruction and malignancy.
