Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2100-7-2**]  4:36:36 PM Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2099-12-13**] ventricular rate is significantly slower.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 49 0 88 466/434 0 -18 71 .
Echo [**2100-7-6**] Conclusions: The left and right atria are markedly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2099-12-16**], estimated  pulmonary artery pressure are slightly higher.
CT Pelvis [**7-8**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Cystic mass in head of pancreas for which followup MRI is recommended when patient is stable.
GI Bleeding Study [**7-9**] INTERPRETATION:  Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells  labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained.
Blood flow images are normal, without focal abnormal hyperemia.
Dynamic blood pool images show no focal abnormality to suggest active hemorrhage.
Delayed images obtained 8 hours later also fail to demonstrate any definite site of active hemorrhage.
Her heart rate was stabilized in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] using 60 mg diltiazem PO qid.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 on [**2100-7-6**] for further eval of need for pacemaker and re-starting anti-coagulation for afib.
Echo on [**2100-7-6**] showed no significant change from [**12-11**] except new PAH.
On the morning of [**7-8**], she developed diffuse abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea, and her BP dropped to 80s systolic.
Ms [**Known lastname 45417**] was transfered to the T-SICU on [**7-8**] with an indication of an  Acute [**Month/Day (4) **] drop 26->19->12, an episode of hypotension (with symptoms).
An immediate CT abdomen was ordered, which showed a significant hematoma at the nephrectomy site.
The packed red blood cell administration was immediately stopped by the nurse.
On [**7-10**], Ms [**Known lastname 45417**] was given 2 units of fresh frozen plasma as she had an INR of 2.5.
The following day, her hematocrit remained stable, and she was due to be transfered to the floor.
Please have a repeat CT abdomen/pelvis in 4 weeks.
Please have a repeat CT abdomen/pelvis in 4 weeks.
