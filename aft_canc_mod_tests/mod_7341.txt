Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon of mild severity.
Old blood in the colon Grade 1 external hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum  CT Abdomen/Pelvis: TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial images were acquired from the lung bases to the pelvic outlet.
Upon review of these images, it was decided that the study was nondiagnostic due to poor penetration from the patient's body habitus.
IMPRESSION:  Nondiagnostic study despite repeated attempts with increased radiation dose.
[**6-28**] U/S: Suboptimal study due to patient's body habitus.
MRI [**7-1**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Extremely limited exam due to body habitus with field-of-view excluding known left flank fluid collection.
CT RLE [**7-3**] IMPRESSION: 1.
However, color flow and pulse Doppler waveform analysis shows full patency of the right and left venous system from the groin to the popliteal fossa.
Repeat HCT in unit [**Unit Number **].7.
Colonoscopy showed no clear source of bleeding, mild diverticulosis, grade 1 internal hemorrhoid, removed fecolith from appendiceal orifice.
Hematocrits remained stable and he was given PO Vitamin K for elevated INR.
#abdominal pain: evaluated by surgery, who thought that pain may be due to discomfort at point of tenderness on exam due to thin skin near area of mesh, no signs on exam of infected mesh and no new hernia on limited CT scan and MRI.
MRI showed seromas which may be inflammed and contributing to pain.
Pt was seen by ID who recommended no further intervention as patients fevers subsided and white count trended down.
Pt's hr was less than 100 following switch and spontaneously coverted to sinus rhyhthm on [**7-8**].
The patient also had a RLE CT scan to rule out nectrotizing fascitis with pain out of proportion to physical exam findings.
The CT showed no NF, but did note cellulits.
LENIS on [**2165-7-9**] were done [**1-24**] persistent pain which were negative.
Patient then triggered for afib with RVR in 140s, BP 102/palp, which was baseline for day.
Transitions of Care: -F/up with GI for further endoscopic evaluation -Trend elevated platlet count as an outpatient.
Information was obtained from webOMR.
