TAGGED RBC SCAN [**2188-8-4**]: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen were obtained for 77 minutes.
A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show no evidence of active GI bleed.
Dynamic blood pool images show no evidence of active GI bleed.
COLONOSCOPY [**2188-8-8**]: Large internal hemorrhoids with stigmata of recent bleeding were noted.
EGD [**2188-8-8**]: A hiatal hernia was seen, displacing the Z-line to 39 cm from the incisors, with hiatal narrowing at 41 cm from the incisors.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the second part of the duodenum.

Hematocrit was monitored, and nadired at 22.4.
He received a total of 6 units of packed RBCs and underwent colonoscopy, which was negative for acute bleeding.
EGD was not repeated, as his EGD at the OSH was negative.
A tagged RBC was performed, which did not show evidence of active bleed.
A second colonoscopy and EGD were performed because of concern for upper, rather than lower GI bleed, but these studies again did not show evidence of acute bleeding.
Omeprazole was increased from 20mg to 40mg daily.
He was instructed to have a repeat hematocrit checked with his primary care physician within one week of discharge.
