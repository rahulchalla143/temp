The pt was undergoing an elective outpatient lung biopsy (TTNBx) of her newly-diagnosed large RUL mass on [**2115-7-4**], and during the procedure she became cyanotic, unresponsive, and pulseless.
CPR was initiated and the pt regained NSR, was intubated, and was transiently on dopamine.
The decision was made to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for IP evaluation for possible endobronchial stenting.
BAL culture returned with Staph aureus sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, with other culture data negative to date.
She also underwent flexible bronchoscopy on Friday [**2115-7-5**] that showed minimal residual bleeding, clots, and LLL obstruction.
Preliminary biopsy results from the RUL Bx are c/w small cell carcinoma.
With regards to her recent diagnosis, she reportedly had weight loss of 25 pounds over the preceding 3-6 months, and SOB.

CXR [**7-8**]: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: .
Prior imaging should be obtained in order to assess the chronicity and likely explanation for widespread pulmonary abnormalities.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with inferior hypokinesis.
An eccentric, posterior directed jet of Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CTA chest/abd/pelvis: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**7-10**]:As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal tube still projects 5.2 cm above the carina.
CXR [**7-12**]: 1.
CXR [**7-24**] :Collapse of the left lung is new, and is probably due to retained secretions because the left bronchial airway is opacified before the takeoff of the upper lobe bronchus.
Pathology [**7-17**]: Right upper lobe, CT-guided core biopsies (S10-2992, [**2115-7-4**]; [**Hospital3 85667**], [**Location (un) 2498**], MA):      Small cell lung carcinoma.
Note:  Enclosed immunohistochemical stains show that tumor cells stain positive for cytokeratin 7 and neuron-specific enolase; cells are negative for cytokeratin 20, TTF-1, chromogranin and synaptophysin.
LCA (CD45) highlights background lymphocytes.
Right upper lobe, touch preparations of biopsy cores (NG10-549, [**2115-7-4**]):      Positive for malignant cells, consistent with small cell lung carcinoma  Note: See core biopsy result (S10-2992) for definitive diagnosis.
Left lower lobe, bronchial brushings (NG10-550, [**2115-7-5**]):      Positive for malignant cells, consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
Left lower lobe, bronchial washings (NG10-552, [**2115-7-5**]) Suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma.
CT Head W/ and W/out contrast [**2115-7-18**]:  No evidence of metastatic disease.
Bone Scan [**7-24**]: no evidence of interosseous metastases  Brief Hospital Course: 69-yo woman smoker with newly-diagnosed RUL and LLL masses, who suffered hemoptysis and PEA arrest while undergoing outpatient RUL Bx, transferred intubated to [**Hospital1 18**] with respiratory failure, VAP / post-obstructive pneumonia, treated for newly dx'd small cell lung cancer.
She was given metoprolol for rate control but was unable to maintain her blood pressure.
RUL and LLL masses - Newly-diagnosed, underwent RUL Bx at OSH on [**2115-7-4**] with prelim Bx report c/w small cell lung carcinoma.
Also noted to have LLL endobronchial lesion with obstruction on bronchoscopy, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for possible endobronchial stenting.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted and performed a bedside bronchoscopy that showed collapse of the left lower lobe airways.
The final pathology showed two primary cancers, both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.
She received one cycle of carboplatin-etoposide therapy with interval response on chest x-ray.
A bone scan showed no evidence of interosseous metastases.
A CT of the head was also without evidence of metastases.
# Acute aortic insufficiency - A cardiac echo performed here showed that the patient had 4+ aortic insufficiency, which was new when compared to the report of an echo performed at [**Hospital1 9191**] on [**2115-7-4**].
Urgent CTA was performed, which showed no evidence of dissection.
TEE was performed which showed no evidence of endocarditis.
The patient's sputum from [**7-9**] grew out MSSA, and therefore the patient's antiboitic regimen was narrowed to nafcillin.
Respiratory failure - The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation after her PEA arrest.
# Hypokalemia - The patient's potassium was chronically low and difficult to replete due to her malignancy, likely ACTH production, and diuretics required for her volume overload.
Her electrolytes were checked frequently and repleted as needed.
Metoprolol, lisinopril, and hydralazine  were added and uptitrated for BP control.
Hypothyroidism - she was continued on home levothyroxine .
