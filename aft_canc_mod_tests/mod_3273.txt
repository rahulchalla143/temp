He was to be admitted today for a blood transfusion, but in the [**Hospital **] clinic was found to be tachycardic to 130, hypotensive to the 90's, and hypoxic to 80% on 2l-nc with a temp of 96.6.
A chest x-ray showed a left mid-lung zone infiltrate and right mid-lung zone increased interstitial markings, no pleural effusions, felt to be consistent with his metastatic disease with a post-obstructive pneumonia.
Currently on Sorafenib experimental chemotherapy protocol, started cycle 2 [**8-24**]; CT-chest on [**7-21**] showed progression of disease.

Left bronchial stent is patent but tissue extending from its proximal extent threatens to occlude the right main bronchus .............. [**2144-9-16**] Bronchoscopy INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Evaluation of airway patency.
#Respiratory failure - Initially the respiratory failure was thought to be d/t either a CAP or postobstructive PNA, and the patient was treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin, and flagyl for possible aspiration PNA.
Gram stain showed GPC in prs, chains, and clusters, as well as GNR's.
Respiratory culture grew OP flora and moderate growth of beta streptococci, not group B.  Metronidazole was stopped and the patient was treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin for a total of 7 days.
Addidionally, the patient was wheezy on physical exam and was given albuterol and atrobent nebulizers, as well as steroids in the setting of hypotension and an inadequate [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim.
A CT scan was done to assess progression of metastatic RCC, and found cancer had progressed while on sorafenil study drug.
A bronchoscopy was performed which showed 80% stenosis of right main and 40-50% stenosis of left main.
The white count trended down, he became afebrile, and gram stain of blood cultures was negative and there was no growth on blood cultures.
#Metastatic RCC - Interval progression on CT of [**2144-9-14**] with new pulmonary nodules and cavitary lesions.
Bronchoscopy showed evidence of right bronchus stenosis of 80% and left bronchus stenosis of 40-50%.
However, renal funciton continued to worsen and urine was spun and muddy brown casts were seen, leading to a diagnosis of ATN.
