Admission Date:  [**2120-5-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-5-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-9-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: cough, carcinoid  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: This is a 67 year-old male, primarily Lebanese speaking, with a past medical history of carcinoid tumor of right lung with past episodes of hemoptysis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease s/p stent placement, pneumonia (atypical vs. post-obstructive), diabetes mellitus, GERD, and positive PPD who was treated for TB with negative sputum cultures who was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital after admission for pneumonia now for rigid bronchoscopy for evaluation and laser therapy of his carcinoid tumor.
Sputum cultures returned "few mixed bacteria consistent with normal respiratory flora including gram negative rods."
Urine cultures have shown no growth to date.
Current chest CT indicates disease progression with a larger hilar mass, new mediastinal node disease, and tumor almost filling the right mainstem bronchus, however, CT and CXR document aeration of right lung indicating that tumor is not completely obstructing.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31573**] spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8099**] [**Name (STitle) **] ([**Hospital1 18**]), interventional pulmonary division, to request rigid bronchoscopy and laser therapy and patient was transferred.
HEENT: Head: normocephalic, atraumatic; Eyes: PERRLA, EOMI, lids and conjunctiva normal; Ears: hearing grossly intact; Oropharynx non-erythematous, no exudate, no lesions Lungs: mild respiratory distress with use of accessory muscles, diffuse expiratory wheezes, but good air movement to bases bilaterally CV: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Abdomen: soft, non-distended, non-tender, BS+ Rectum: deferred GU: deferred Extremities: warm, well-perfused, no edema, 2+ PT and DP pulses bilaterally Skin: no rashes or lesions Neuro: A+Ox3, grossly intact  Pertinent Results: [**2120-5-4**] Culture, Respiratory ([**Hospital1 1474**]): few mixed bacteria with normal respiratory flora including gram negative rods [**2120-5-4**] Gram Stain, Respiratory ([**Hospital1 1474**]): no epithelial cells/LPF, [**10-28**] WBC/LPF, [**1-13**] mixed bacteria consistent with normal respiratory flora [**2120-5-4**] Culture, Urine ([**Hospital1 1474**]): no growth [**2120-5-5**] Chem ([**Hospital1 1474**]): Na 139 K4.2 Cl 105 CO2 26 Ca 8.5, Mg 2.0, Gluc 100, BUN 20, Cr 1.1, Phos 3.2 [**2120-5-5**] CBC/diff ([**Hospital1 1474**]): WBC 9.1 RBC 4.64 HGB 12.4 HCT 38.0 MCV 81.0 PLT 252 NEUT 72.3 LYMPHS 16.5 MONO 8.7 EOS 2.3 BASO 0.2 [**2120-5-3**] CXR PA/LAT ([**Hospital1 1474**]): Study is read in conjunction with recent CT scan from previous day.
Chest radiograph again shows a somewhat ovoid tubular opacity within the right middle lobe extending to the right hilum which on CT scan appears to correspond to a fluid and/or debris filled distal mainstem and right middle lobe bronchi likely representing superimposed infectious process and/or mucoid impactin in associated bronchiectatic right middle lobe bronchi.
Clinical correlation and if indicated bronchoscopic examination is suggested.
[**2120-5-2**] Chest CT ([**Hospital1 1474**]): 3.9 x 4.5 x 3 cm right parahilar mass increased slightly in size since prior study.

Two repeat bronchoscopies were attempted, both times clot and secretions overflowed from the right when the ET tube was pulled back and it was thought to be unsafe to attempt washout or aspiration for fear of causing significant cross contamination of the good lung.
Pts blood pressures remained low and pt intermittently required pressors, complicated by intermittent AF with RVR.
