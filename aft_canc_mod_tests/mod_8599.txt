CT abd/pelvis [**3-1**] - 1.
LENIs [**3-1**] - Bilateral occlusive thrombus involving the bilateral common femoral and superficial femoral veins as well as the right popliteal vein.
A CT abd/pelvis was obtained on the night of admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given concern for abdominal tenderness and new onset ascites which revealed a large subcutaneous abscess around the site of the patient's J tube, multiple hepatic lesions suspicious for either abscess vs. necrotic metastases, possible cholangitis, and new large ascites.
Radiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the pt underwent a CT guided aspiration of the SQ abscess, liver lesions and a 4 L US guided paracentesis which ruled out SBP, however GNR were growing on culture.
Unfortunately, there was no clinical improvement in terms of the pt's blood pressures after the procedure and vasopressin was added to augment levophed.
Albumin of 2.2.
