A [**Name (NI) 71316**] wire crossed the lesion with minimal difficulty.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis at the ostium of the D1, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow.
Agniography of the right femoral arteriotomy site showed a site compatible with  percutaneous closure.
FINDINGS:  Bilateral lower extremity ABIs, Doppler waveforms, and PVRs were performed at rest.
On the right, the femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis waveforms are all [**Hospital1 **]/triphasic.
The right femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial waveforms are all biphasic.
# Hypotension:  On the 10th day of his hospital stay, he triggered for hypotension with SBP to 70, fever to 102 and a lactate of 2.9.
Also risk for hypotension with blood loss, Hct trending down.
CT abdomen did not reveal any evidence of acute infection.
EKG at the time was reassuring with sinus tachycardia with nonspecific and stable lateral ST segment changes.
Cardiac enzymes were monitored and were slightly elevated (peak troponin 0.21, peak CK-MB 5).
On [**6-17**] continued to c/o CP, partially relieved by nitropaste, and on [**6-18**] it was decided to send pt for cardiac catheterization to relieve sxs.
Unstable angina s/p cardiac catheterization with BMS placement to diag1.
His hematocrit was maintained at 30.
Previous UC showed yeast.
UA on [**6-25**] showed pyuria with some bacteria.
Final result of bone biopsy showed clean tibial margin with gram positive cocci in amputated toe.
# [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Baseline creatinine 1.2, peaked at 1.8.
New inderminate enhancing soft tissue mass encasing the left renal artery noted on Abd CT on [**2114-4-19**].
Head CT without evidence of mets.

OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5 mg PO Q4H:PRN pain 9.
NPH 18 Units Breakfast NPH 9 Units Bedtime 9.
OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5 mg PO Q4H:PRN pain 13.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of the infection in your left toe that required amputation.
We performed several blood tests and found that you were having a mild heart attack.
Following the procedure, you had a low blood pressure and temperature and were transferred to the medical ICU.
