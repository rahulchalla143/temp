On day of admission, pt with increasing somnolence and O2 sat 80s on room air --> 92% on 2L.
Pt ruled out by cardiac enzymes and EKG for MI.
Repeat echo done to rule out [**Name (NI) 31820**] [**Name (NI) 3564**] showed EF 60% and functioning mechanical valves.
On CXR pt with loculated effusion that was tapped on [**2129-2-14**] c/w transudative process per D/C summary.
CAD - s/p cath [**2128-10-20**] with 3VD:  99% distal LAD, 60% LCx at origin of prior PTCA, RCA 50% distal with 70% RPL.
CHF - EF >55% 2+MR [**Last Name (Titles) 31820**], RV dysfunction, moderate pulmonary HTN 4.
CRI baseline Cr 1.5-1.7 6.
MDS 7.
Initially, his PA pressures were 70s/30s, with a wedge of 23.
His CO was 7 with an SVR of 469.
He was not placed on an ACE-I or beta-blocker given his relative hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the high 80s and 90s - which is his baseline blood pressure.
His goal INR is 2.5 to 3.5 as he also has 2 prosthetic valves.
CRI- Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.7.
His creatinine ranged from 1.7-1.9 during his stay.
His baseline Hct is 29-30.
Our goal Hct for him is to transfuse for Hct <27 as his hematocrit drops within a few days post transfusion regardless.
His hematocrit remained stable otherwise throughout his stay.
Pulmonary followed the patient and believed the patient would benefit from an outpatient sleep study and PFTs to assess for obstructive sleep apnea.
He was at first treated with diamox which had little effect on his serum bicarbonate and was thus, discontinued.
It is important that his potassium is checked frequently and maintained above 4.0 to ensure his bicarbonate does not rise further.
