His last chemo was [**12-29**] & XRT was [**12-31**].
-HTN -Hypercholesterolemia -COPD -- pt unaware of this as a dx, though he has been on spiriva as oupt -Shingles [**9-22**] -Right arm keratosis excision; -Benign laryngeal polyp excision [**2131**]  Social History: Married, supportive spouse, who is [**Name8 (MD) **] RN.

CXR [**1-30**]:  Compared to the film from earlier the same day, there is some new hazy opacity at the right heart border that could represent small area of infiltrate, volume loss.
# Neutropenic fever/hospital-acquired PNA: Pt developed fever to 104 with sBPs in 70s and HR 150s.
Pt was rigorring mildly on the floor when an EKG was obtained he appeared to be in sinus tach.
ABG revealed 7.45/36/109.
Pt was transferred to ICU, where CXR ([**1-30**]) revealed some new hazy opacity at the right heart border that could represent small area of infiltrate, volume loss.
CBC on admission demonstrated WBC 1.6, Hct 29.4 (s/p transfusion of 2 units PRBCs on [**2163-1-25**]), and Plt 90.
Hct dropped to 24.7, prompting transfusion of 2 units PRBCs on [**2-2**] to maximize oxygen-carrying capacity of blood to minimize SOB.
His Hct reposonded appropriately to the 2 units of PRBC and was in the 30's on discharge.
The head of his bed was kept elevated, and lasix was given, if blood pressure permitted, to minimize fluid retention.
Low Hct may also be contributing--baseline Hct unknown.
S/p Decadron, Taxotere, & Carboplatin on [**12-29**] & XRT on [**12-31**]--none since.
