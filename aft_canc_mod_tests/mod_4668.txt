============== MICRO: ==============    CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2199-8-15**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
Blood culture: pending Urine culture: Negative   Brief Hospital Course: 82F with UC, PSC, COPD and recent SBO s/p lysis of adhesions, discharged on [**8-3**] from hospitalization for presumed cholangitis, (ERCP deferred, pt improved on antbx) re-presents with septic physiology.
No infectious source found with CXR, CT abd, blood and urine cultures.
GI and ERCP team evaluated the patient and felt no need for ERCP, especially since intra-hepatic stenting would not be possible given her primary sclerosing cholangitis.
We also considered endocarditis or osteomyelitis as possible sources for recurrent sepsis; echocardiogram negative for vegetations, recent MRI spine also unremarkable (back pain improved since that study per patient).
ID felt this was potentially recurrent cholangitis - perhaps an organism resistant to cipro/flagyl (such as enterococcus).
S/p recent ERCP x2 where CBD stent was replaced and then removed.
CT findings suggest possible persistent PSC-related inflammation but LFTs not elevated and patient without much RUQ abdominal pain.
ERCP team evalutated the patient and did not want to re-ERCP based on clinical presentation and CT scans from OSH.
INR 2.1 at OSH admission, held there in context of infection.
INR at discharge = 2.0.
Coumadin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: take as directed by PCP for goal INR [**2-21**].
Outpatient Lab Work Ask your PCP to check your INR at your visit on Monday.
An extensive workup was done, and no source of infection was identified; however, you improved with broad spectrum IV antibiotics.
You should have your INR checked at this visit.
