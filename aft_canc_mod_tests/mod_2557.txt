Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-9-9**], estimated cardiac output is lower.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with RVEDP 25mm Hg, mean PCWP 34mm Hg.
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with mean PA 40mmHg secondary to elevated left-sided pressures with a transpulmonary gradient of 6mmHg.
Severely depressed cardiac output with cardiac index 1.21 with arterial O2 saturation by pulse oximetry 97% on room air and PA O2 saturation of 30%.
Limited assessment of the abdomen shows normal bowel caliber.
# Hypotension: He became hypotensive the day after admission with repeat echocardiogram suggestive of low-output heart failure.
He was started on a low dose dopamine infusion and milrinone was initiated which resulted in improvement in blood pressures, excellent urine output 10L net negative and weight loss with improvement in kidney function and liver enzymes c/w fluid overload as cause of both.
He was taken off dopamine and milrinone before transfer to the floor and pressures were stable after initial hospital course.
Torsemide was held on discharge due to increase in creatinine with plan to resume as an outpatient once creatinine returned to baseline.
He underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated marked elevation in right and left heart filling pressures and low cardiac index consistent with CHF.
His diuretics should continue to be titrated since his fluid balance is difficult to manage.
His volume status is difficult to assess on exam as he rarely has peripheral edema and tends to hold extra fluid in his abdomen.
His weight at discharge is 60.2 kg.
# Pleural Effusions/Burkitts and Hodgkin's lymphoma: Moderate right pleural effusion with a likely subpulmonic component on CXR from ED.
Urine culture was negative and pleural effusion showed no evidence of infection, thus abx were discontinued with exception of flagyl.
# Diarrhea: Stool studies showed +ve c.diff so pt was started on a 14 day course of flagyl.
