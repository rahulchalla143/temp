She was noted to be persistently tachycardic and febrile to 104, and had hypotension with SBP 80-90s that was fluid responsive that has since become fluid refractory.
Labs notable for neutropenia, acute renal failure, and a peak lactate of 3.4 that has since returned to 1.2.

Her platelet count was normal.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**2147-8-10**].
It was a dry tap but revealed a hypercellular bone marrow (70-80% cellularity) with extensive infiltration by mantle cell lymphoma.
Flow cytometry on the marrow revealed CD20+ cells that co-express CD5, FMC7 and lack CD23.
FISH showed a fusion of CCND1 and IGH [ (11;14)].
CT torso on [**2147-8-11**] showed several peripheral irregularly-shaped splenic hypodensities in the setting of an enlarged spleen, concerning for lymphomatous lesions versus infarctions.
A bone marrow biopsy was repeated on [**2147-8-31**] and showed a hypercellular marrow with persistent involvement by mantle cell lymphoma, with atypical lymphoid infiltrates compromising 60-70% of marrow cellularity.
She was admitted for C2 part A of hyperCVAD on [**2147-9-29**] and did well, except for pancytopenia and frequent blood transfusions which delayed the start of part B.
