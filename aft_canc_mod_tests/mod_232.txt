At clinic, he was noted to have increased peripheral edema (increased over 1 wk per the patient) and was sent to the ED where his vitals were T 97.1 HR 76 BP 148/80 RR 25 SpO2 92%/RA.
CXR revealed bilateral layering effusions and pulmonary edema.
ECG was unchanged and cardiac enzymes were CK 137, MB 9, TnT 0.02.
He underwent cardiac cath at that admission that resulted in angioplasty of a significant 80% left main lesion, that subsequently restenosed.
He subsequently underwent cardiac cath on [**2172-3-26**] that was unsuccessful at circumflex revascularization, resulting in dissection of that artery and contained perforation.
Physical Exam: Vitals - T 95.5 BP 132/65 HR 78 RR 20 SpO2 98%/3L Generally the patient was elderly, well developed, well nourished and well groomed.
The neck was supple with JVP of 12cm.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th intercostal space, mid clavicular line.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no xanthomas.

EKG demonstrated NSR, normal axis, IVCD, prolonged PR, <1mm ST depressions V4-6 with no significant change compared with prior dated [**2172-6-27**].
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2172-6-25**] demonstrated: EF 30-35%.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-3-27**], left ventricular systolic function now appears more depressed and right ventricular systolic function is now depressed.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**3-/2172**] demonstrated: 1.
CXR [**2172-7-27**] - 1.
Findings may correlate with right hilar lymph node as was seen on recent CT from [**2172-7-22**].
Overnight, he required treatment with vasopressors and PRBC to keep his pressure stable.
