A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
It was decided to perform a brain biopsy to further assess this temporal lesion.
Lower extremity duplexes were also performed revealing an extensive clot in her right leg.
Preoperative labs and studies were ordered including an infectious work up.
On [**12-7**] she underwent IVC Filter placement and a brain biopsy/aspiration.
Post op Head CT revealed no hemorrhage.
Head CT with contrast on [**12-8**] revealed partial resolution of abscess with peristent edema.
On [**12-11**],The patient exam was stable.
Infectious disease recommended discontinuation of vancomycin, initiation of CeftriaXONE 2 gm IV Q12H, and continuation of MetRONIDAZOLE (FLagyl) 500 mg IV Q8H.
Infectious disease would also like to have the patient follow up with them in 4 weeks with a MRI Brain with and without contrast.
Serum magnesium and postassium were low and were repleated.
She had an MRI brain on [**12-13**] and was being prepared for transfer to rehab.
Her MRI showed no acute abnormalities, her exam was stable, and she was deemed fit for transfer to rehab on the morning of [**2118-12-13**].
