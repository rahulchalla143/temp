In the Emergency Department the patient was noted to have a heart rate in the 140s with progressive hypoxia to as low as 77% on a nonrebreather.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, temperature 99.4.
Heart rate 140.
Blood pressure 122/75.
Respiratory rate 16.
Sating 98% on room air and then subsequently 77% on 100% face mask.
Rectal examination guaiac negative.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 7.7, hematocrit 29.7, platelets 225, sodium 127, potassium 4.4, chloride 94, bicarb 27, BUN 18, creatinine 0.7, glucose 288.
Arterial blood gas 7.48/30/67/lactate equals 1.8.
Chest x-ray bibasilar infiltrates in the dependent regions.
CT of the head no evidence of bleed or mass, but low attenuation left cerebellar area.
CT of the chest, diffuse infiltrate consistent with congestive heart failure, but no evidence of PE.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was noted to have marked hypoxia at the time of admission, which was originally thought to be secondary to a PE, however, his CT angiogram was negative.
The CT scan also demonstrated evidence of an alveolar process, which was felt to be congestive heart failure versus pneumonia.
The patient was treated with intravenous Diltiazem push without change in his pulse, however, his systolic blood pressure did drop to the 70s.
Cardiology consult subsequently recommended attempting rate control with an Esmolol drip, initiating gentle diuresis and obtaining a portable echocardiogram to assess function and valvular disease.
The patient was placed on an Esmolol and a neo-synephrine drip, which were titrated as needed to keep a mean blood pressure of greater then 60 and a rate less then 100.
The patient was treated with Lasix for gentle diuresis and cardiac enzymes were cycled to evaluate for the potential of myocardial ischemia as an initiating event.
The patient's multifocal atrial tachycardia persisted and an echocardiogram was obtained.
The echocardiogram demonstrated 4+ MR with a flail mitral leaflet and a normal end systolic dimensions.
Given that blood cultures obtained at the time of admission were subsequently demonstrating gram positive coxae in pairs and chains it was felt the patient was most likely suffering from endocarditis.
As the patient underwent gentle diuresis his oxygen saturations began to improve and his supplemental oxygen needs were slowly titrated down.
The patient's blood culture results demonstrated enterococcus, which was Ampicillin sensitive and therefore the patient was placed on Penicillin therapy intravenously with Gentamycin for synergy for two weeks after therapy.
The patient's heart rate remained tachycardic, which is felt to be likely a compensatory response given the patient's poor forward flow secondary to acute mitral regurgitation.
However, on the evening following transfer to the flor the patient became suddenly tachycardic and hypotensive with a blood pressure in the 70s and a heart rate in the 150s.
The patient appeared to respond well to the beta blocker with a decrease in his heart rate, however, additional fluid therapy did little to help the patient's blood pressure and resulting in a significantly worsened oxygen requirement.
Therefore the patient was treated once again with Lasix and over the next few hospital days a careful balance was maintained between controlling the patient's heart rate and not dropping his blood pressure too low.
The patient maintained a systolic blood pressure in the high 80s to low 90s, however, he tolerated this blood pressure well with adequate urine output and normal mentation.
The patient was currently on Digoxin and Lopressor for rate control and the patient's heart rate was maintained in the 90s to low 100s.
Therefore the patient was started on low dose Coumadin therapy with a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
At this point given the difficulty of maintaining the patient with adequate blood pressure and heart rate a family meeting was obtained in order to evaluate the patient and families goals in the setting of the [**Hospital 228**] medical problems.
However, the patient continued to demonstrate mild setbacks such as on [**4-5**] when the patient was transferring from bed to chair and became acutely short of breath with a subsequent heart rate in the 150s, systolic blood pressure in the 60s and a drop in his oxygen saturations to 80 to 85%.
At this point, however, the patient was treated with intravenous Lopressor 5 mg times two doses with a subsequent drop in his heart rate to the 100s and a bump in his systolic blood pressure to the 190s.
Therefore it was demonstrated that the patient did well when his Lopressor was administered despite low blood pressures, because his blood pressure acutely responsive to his heart rate.
In addition, the patient was started on a daily dose of Lasix at 20 mg po q day and was monitored for the appropriateness of that dose for continued effective gentle diuresis.
At the time of discharge the patient's Lopressor had been titrated up to 62.5 mg t.i.d., which his blood pressure was able to tolerate.
A therapeutic INR was obtained on Coumadin at 1 mg po q day.
Although the patient consistently demonstrated a blood pressure with a systolic in the low 80s, the patient maintained adequate urine output and excellent mentation.
Therefore it was felt that the most important therapeutic intervention was to maintain the patient's heart rate at approximately 100 and therefore the patient's beta blocker should not be held unless his blood pressure was low enough to cause low urine output or mental status changes.
