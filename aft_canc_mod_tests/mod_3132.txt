CT Head ([**2131-11-11**]) Stable appearance of the brain parenchyma since the prior examination including unchanged appearance of large round sellar mass.
CT-Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**2132-11-27**]) 3.5 x 3.3 cm region of inflammatory fat stranding in the midline abdomen, just medial to the G-tube insertion site, most consistent with a phlegmon.
CXR ([**2131-11-5**])  AP chest compared to [**9-28**] and [**11-2**], [**2127**].
CXR ([**11-19**]) 1.
Left mid lung zone nodular opacity, which has grown compared to older chest radiographs and is highly concerning for primary lung malignancy.
EKG [**2131-11-5**]: sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes, occasional PVCs.
Echo ([**2131-11-13**]):The left atrium is normal in size.
Blood cultures: ([**2131-11-11**]) - MRSA; ([**Date range (3) 45680**]) NGTD .
Sputum cultures: ([**2131-11-22**], [**2131-11-26**], [**2131-11-29**]) - MRSA .

Tissue (esophagus) culture ([**2131-11-21**]) - [**Female First Name (un) **]  Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course by problem: .
On [**11-8**], her ventilatory requirements were weaned, and that morning she was extubated.
On [**11-22**], she went to the OR and a tracheostomy, left lingular BAL, EGD, and open G tube were performed.
Notably she had concretized tube feeds in her esophagus, and follow up formal EGD and biopsy were recommended.
Post op, her course was marked by tachycardia and hypertension, with sputum cultures continuing to grow MRSA.
Blood pressure.
Cortisol stimulation test was normal.
Following placement of a central line, she was given fluid boluses to maintain CVP 12-14.
She then maintained her blood pressure ~90-100 systolic, with hypertensive episodes when anxious/agitated.
Central line culture grew MRSA, as did blood cultures and sputum cultures.
Her WBC jumped to 47.6 with a clear left shift on [**11-12**], and then trended down to baseline (high 10's, low 20s) over the next several days.
TTE was negative for vegetations or lesions.
Her last positive blood culture was from [**11-11**], and surveillance cultures remained no growth.
CXR on admission showed bilateral lower lobe interstitial infiltrate concerning for pneuomonia.
Rapid viral cultures were negative.
Initial sputum sample was positive for gram positive cocci in pairs, a second sample was negative, and cultures only grew sparse oropharyngeal flora.
Sputum cultures on [**2131-11-22**] grew MRSA, and she was treated with vancomycin, which she was on for MRSA bacteremia, and then linezolid (14 day course, initiated [**11-26**]).
As an outpatient, she had been described as borderline diabetic, with elevated 2 hr glucose of 197 and hgba1c of 6.2.
Cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage done at the time of tracheostomy was positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
