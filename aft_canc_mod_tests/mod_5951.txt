ACTIVE ISSUES: # GI bleed: The patient presents with numerous risk factors for a GI bleed: lovenox, asa, and elevated INR.
Rectal exam was guiac positive x 2 and thought to be secondary to iron supplementation.
Her Hct dropped from 26.5 to 21.7 during admission.
After transition to the general medical floor, goals of care were discussed and the decision was made to discontinue lab draws, blood transfusions.
Her HCT remained stable in the low 20s.
# Sepsis: Based on her HR and WBC count, she met SIRS criteria on admission with the most likely source of her infection being a UTI given her positive UA.
However the wound on her leg was stable with minimal purulence or erythema.
At the time of discharge, her SIRS resolved, and her WBC was still elevated 18-20.
#Primary Myelofibrosis requiring transfusions: she presented with elevated WBC and thrombocytosis of 1608K, which may be partly be secondary to her underlying myelofibrosis, which was diagnosed in [**2123-3-14**] from bone marrow bx.
Her antibody screen was positive for anti-E, and her antigen typing is reported as E+.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Her HCT was stable in the low 20s on discharge.
At the time of discharge, her platelet count was 1400. .
# Coagulopathy: The etiology of her coagulopathy with an INR of 2.7 on admission is unclear at this time.
Goals of care were transitioned to include no future lab draws, no blood tranfusions and no re-hospitalizations.
Calcium 500 + 500 (1250)-400 units (1-2 tablets) PO BID 16.
