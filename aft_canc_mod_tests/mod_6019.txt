Her baseline hct is 30, and during this admission, it dropped to as low as 23.9.
She had small amounts of bright red blood in her stool, although nothing to explain the 6 point hematocrit drop.
She was started on IV proton-pump inhibitor and her hematocrit stabilized in the low thirties on the fifth hospital day, and remained stable with stable vital signs.
She was transferred to the floors on hospital day 6, and her hematocrit followed twice daily.
EKGs did not show acute changes and cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative.
She was transfused a total of 9 units PRBCs to keep her hct above 25.
Her blood pressure has been well-controlled, despite being off meds, with ranges in the 120s-140s/60-70s.
We held her oral hypoglycemics and kept her on sliding scale humalog insulin.
As above, her metoprolol, Cozaar, Imdur and triamterene/HCTZ were stopped in the setting of GI bleed.
These can be resumed as outpatient if her blood pressure warrants additional meds, although during this admission her pressures have been relatively well-controlled without.
Hematocrit stable.
Your red cell count has been stable now for three days.
