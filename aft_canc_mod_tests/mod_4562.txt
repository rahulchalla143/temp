Brief Hospital Course: 65yo F with h/o metastatic melanoma recently finished IL2 therapy with neurotoxicity, dermatitis, capillary leak, hypotension, and myocarditis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension and found to have hypoxia as well.

For her hypotension, she was started on empiric antibiotic treatment with vanc/cefepime/flagyl and stress dose steroids.
