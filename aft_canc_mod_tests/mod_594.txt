According to her daughter, the patient has been tired; which had been attributed to her oxycodone which was taken for pain.
She had a head computed tomography which was negative.
Her blood urea nitrogen was 43 and creatinine was 1.7.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25% to 30%.
Echocardiogram done in [**2178-12-3**].
Mass at the head of pancreas with magnetic resonance imaging in [**2179-3-5**] concerning for lymphoma versus adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 96.1, heart rate was 120, blood pressure was 154/70, respiratory rate was 33, oxygen saturation was 98% on 4 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were 2 mm bilaterally.
Pulmonary examination revealed crackles at the left base; left greater than right.
Cardiovascular examination revealed normal first heart sound and second heart sound with a systolic murmur.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed arterial blood gas was 7.41/33/112.
White blood cell count was white blood cell count was 5.5., hematocrit was 38.7, and platelets were 46.
Differential with 80% neutrophils and 18% lymphocytes.
Absolute neutrophil count was 4980.
Cortisol level was 34.
Sodium was 139, potassium was 3.2, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was 43, creatinine was 1.7 (most recent creatinine was 1.1), and blood glucose was 663.
Her urine showed a glucose of greater than 1000 with 15 ketones, pH was 5, 3 to 5 white blood cells, 3 to 5 red blood cells, a few bacteria, trace acetone in the serum.
ALT was 21, AST was 13, alkaline phosphatase was 112, amylase was 104, total bilirubin was 0.7., creatine kinase was 80, LDH was 450.
Troponin was less than 0.3.
Calcium was 8.1, magnesium was 2.4, phosphate was 4.
Albumin was 3.
IgG on [**2179-4-9**] was 2335 and on [**4-22**] was 1868.
Serum toxicology screen was negative as was urine toxicology screen.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   An echocardiogram done in [**2178-4-2**] showed an ejection fraction of 25% to 30% with global hypokinesis, 3+ mitral regurgitation, and left ventricular moderately dilated.
A chest x-ray done on admission showed left lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate, a small left effusion, moderate congestive heart failure.
A computed tomography of the head showed punched out lesions.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen on [**2179-4-20**] showed 7-cm X 3-cm at the pancreatic head; atypical for adenoma, question of plasmacytoma versus lymphoma.
Her arterial blood gas had a pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 36, PO2 of 123.
Her fingersticks were stopped once palliative care had been decided.
She did have an electroencephalogram to assess for any seizure focus, and that also did not show any conclusive evidence for seizure.
The electroencephalogram had suggested possible left focal cortical abnormalities.
The electroencephalogram had suggested a left temporal focus, but since the CT scan did not show any evidence, it was further pursued as she could not tolerate a magnetic resonance imaging.
She had a repeat electroencephalogram which did not show any focal slowing.
Unlikely to be having ongoing seizures with the report, and a repeat magnetic resonance imaging was not able to be performed.
A chest x-ray was suggestive of possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
She had a lumbar puncture done.
The cerebrospinal fluid did not show any polymorphonuclear cells.
It showed 11 white blood cells with 77% polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
The glucose was 220 and protein was 483.
Dermatology was consulted and a biopsy was taken.
However, her creatinine improved with some fluid hydration.
However, her urine output throughout the course of this admission was felt to be poor.
She did not receive a CT angiogram during the course of this admission.
