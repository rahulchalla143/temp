During his course of the evaluation, he underwent a chest and abdominal CT that was performed on [**2190-7-2**], which demonstrated a left breast mass measuring 2.1 x 1.7 cm.
Also work-up included a CT of the abdomen demonstrating a metastatic tumor.
The CT of the abdomen demonstrated a 2.8 x 3.7 cm lesion in the segment VI of the liver, and a 3.9 x 4.1 cm mass in the midpole of the right kidney.
On [**2190-7-13**], a PET scan was performed demonstrating a left breast FDG avid mass, and an anterior midpole right renal mass that is FDG avid, and a large non-FDG avid mediastinal lymph node.
Biopsy was performed of the right renal mass on [**2190-8-10**], demonstrating no evidence of malignancy, but a fine- needle aspirate was positive for renal cell carcinoma.
On [**2190-9-3**], a core liver biopsy of the liver mass was performed demonstrating moderately to poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
Follow-up MRI was performed on [**2190-9-1**], demonstrating a 3.3 x 2.5 cm lesion, segment V and VI, of the liver, and 3.5 x 4.0 cm lesion in the right kidney.
Part of the work-up included head CT on [**2190-9-1**], which was negative for metastatic disease.
The patient did have a blood transfusion 40 years ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Blood pressure 142/78, pulse 88, respirations 28, temperature 97, height 6 ft 0 in, weight 192.6 lb.
Carotids 2+ out of 4 without bruits.
LABORATORY DATA:  Prior to admission, WBC 11.3, hematocrit 49.0, platelets 366; INR 1.2; sodium 142, 4.7, 105, 23, BUN and creatinine 23 and 1.4; AST 22, ALT 14, alkaline phosphatase 82, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 4.1.
In [**2190-6-18**], his AST was 4.2, and CEA was 5.5.
Postoperatively the patient had a WBC of 15.8, hematocrit 40.1, platelets 191, PT 16.4, PTT 35.2, INR 1.9.
The patient had a sodium of 146, 4.6, 117, 20, BUN 29 and 2.1.
ALT 96, AST 135, alkaline phosphatase 67, 0.9.
The patient had a postoperative chest x-ray demonstrating mild congestive heart failure which has improved, small bilateral pleural effusion, no evidence of pneumothorax identified.
The patient was given FFP for an INR of 1.9.
The patient was getting serial coags to keep INR less than 2.5.
Repeat chest x-ray [**9-26**] revealed worsening bilateral pleural effusion and bilateral bibasilar atelectasis.
The patient's blood sugars were intermittently elevated.
The results of the pathology came back from his surgery demonstrated:  1.
LFTs were obtained demonstrating an ALT of 30, AST 33, alkaline phosphatase 167, total bilirubin 3.7, which both alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin had increased from the day before.
A liver duplex was obtained on [**2190-10-2**], demonstrating status post right hepatic lobectomy with patent vasculature and no large fluid collections identified.
Also a CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained on [**2190-10-2**], demonstrated 1) no intrahepatic bile duct dilatation or perihepatic fluid collections, 2) no intraperitoneal or intrapelvic abscess, and 3) basilar lung changes with small effusions, emphysematous changes and areas of consolidations.
Because the patient's WBC had elevated, blood cultures, peritoneal fluid, urine cultures and sputum culture was obtained.
From [**10-2**], two sets of blood cultures were obtained which are still pending.
Anaerobic culture demonstrated no growth.
Urine culture was obtained on [**2190-10-3**], demonstrating Morganella morganii.
Another chest x-ray was obtained demonstrating improving pneumonia in both lower lobes, continued mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly superimposed on underlying emphysema.
WBC was 17.6 from 21.5 on [**2190-10-4**].
The patient had a hematocrit of 34.6 on [**2190-10-5**], with platelets of 248, sodium was 139, 4.2, 105, 24, BUN and creatinine of 59 and 2.6, glucose 108, ALT 31, AST 53, alkaline phosphatase 249, total bilirubin 4.1.
The patient can be monitored for blood sugar over night.
[**Last Name (un) **] will be seeing him tomorrow to decide whether or not the patient needs to go home on a sliding scale or to be given doses of regular insulin.
