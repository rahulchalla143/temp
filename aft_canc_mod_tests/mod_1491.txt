The patient was undergoing an outpatient staging workup of his lung cancer when he was unexpectedly admitted from [**2178-12-23**], to [**2178-12-31**], when noted to have an INR of 8.0 during a clinic visit.
The patient underwent CT scan of his abdomen to evaluate persistent pyuria and hematuria on [**2178-12-28**], during which he was noted to have a 3.8 centimeter diverticular abscess adjacent to the posterior wall of the bladder.
Coronary artery disease, status post cardiac catheterization on [**2179-1-1**], and status post myocardial infarction.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 15.7, hematocrit 35.7 and platelet count of 278,000.
His coagulation studies revealed a prothrombin time of 14.4, partial thromboplastin time 27.3 and INR of 1.4.
His CEA was 27.0, CA125 was 61.0.
He was started on his bowel prep and was seen by the gastroenterology service in preparation for his colonoscopy which was to be performed on [**2179-1-5**].
The patient underwent his colonoscopy on [**2179-1-5**], as planned during which he was noted to have diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon and three polyps at the ascending colon and the proximal descending colon.
A polyp at 55 centimeters on the proximal ascending colon was excised.
His oxygen saturation which had been approximately 94 to 96% in room air on admission went down to 90%.
An electrocardiogram obtained at the bedside revealed 2.0 millimeter ST segment elevations in leads V2 through V4.
A chest x-ray was also obtained which revealed collapse of the patient's left lower lobe with some midline shift.
A cardiology consultation was requested and the patient transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in preparation for a bronchoscopy.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were ultimately negative for myocardial infarction.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy on the afternoon of [**2179-1-6**], during which some thick mucous plugs were suctioned out of his left and right lower lobes.
A x-ray obtained after the bronchoscopy revealed reexpansion of the patient's left lower lobe.
The decision was made following discussion with the patient, the surgeon and the patient's primary care physician to continue medically managing the patient's perforated diverticulitis with antibiotics with follow-up CAT scan on [**2179-1-12**].
The patient is also to follow-up with his primary care physician within one to two weeks following discharge for further management of his lung cancer and cardiac status.
