He was given 22 units insulin and had a BP of 86/51.
Sensitivities have just returned and the GNR appears to be sensitive to cipro.
Urine sediment revealed muddy [**Known lastname **] casts consistent with ATN.
As of the day of transfer, his urine output has increased to almost 4L in the past 24 hours.
A CXR was negative for pna and a head CT was limited by motion but prelim negative.
A RIJ was placed with a CVP of 8, and he was also started on levophed and an insulin drip.

The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
CT head IMPRESSION: 1.
Markedly limited study due to patient motion.
Evaluation for infarction is limited on this motion-limited study, and MRI is more sensitive for detection of acute ischemia (for which the patient would require sedation in order to obtain).
CXR [**2-1**]: New opacification in both lower lungs could be pneumonia.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3095**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4369**] was paged   Brief Hospital Course: 68 YO M with IgA MM, IDDM2, CKD, and schizophrenia admitted to the MICU with AMS and hypotension found to have urosepsis and ATN.
Prostate exam benign (no tenderness on exam), scheduled for urology follow-up as outpatient.
He was last febrile on [**2-2**] and levaquin was started for possible b/l PNA on CXR (though no  hypoxia or respiratory complaints).
Final blood and urine cultures must be followed up after discharge (last positive blood cx on [**1-29**]).
Urine sediment revealed muddy [**Known lastname **] casts consistent with ATN.
He was maintained on IVF but made excellent urine output of 4L for each of the 3 days prior to discharge, illustrating post-ATN diuresis.
His creatinine trended down to 3.9 on the day of discharge.
History of poorly controlled finger sticks now exacerbated in setting of infection.
Platelets trended down but stable throughout hospitalization.
Platelets of 134 on discharge and were trending up at that point.
CBC should be checked as outpatient, and further management as per heme-onc team.
Urosepsis 2.
