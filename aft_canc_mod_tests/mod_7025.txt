CT PELVIS: The rectum and sigmoid colon are grossly normal.
Within the visualized liver is redemonstration of several low-density peripherally oriented liver masses, unchanged from the most recent prior study of earlier the same day.
Calcification along the posterior aspect of the mitral valve, perhaps along the posterior leaflet, which may be related to the cardiac abnormalities noted on physical examination.
Partially visualized liver masses, better described and visualized on prior CT abdomen dated earlier the same day.
FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT LYMPH NODE BIOPSY  FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests (antibodies) were performed:   CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD19, CD20, FMC7, HLA-DR, Kappa, Lambda, CD45, CD23.
INTERPRETATION: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a lambda-restricted B cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Note: By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic lymphoid cells are diffusely positive for pan B-cell markers CD20, CD79a, PAX-5 (dim), and MUM-1 (dim).
A MIB-1 stain is difficult to assess do to the admixed nonneoplastic hemopoietic precursors, but is focally up to 30%.
The above morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with involvement by a large B-cell lymphoma with exhibit peculiar plasma cell differentiation features with many cells containing crystalline cytoplasmic inclusions, which are presumably composed of immunoglobulin.
The significance of these findings is uncertain at this time, but needs to be established by cytogenetics studies and clinical follow up.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
The white blood cell count appears normal with scattered atypical, large lymphoid cells, some of which contain cytoplasmic crystalline inclusions.
Differential count shows 80% neutrophils, 3% bands, 10% monocytes, 5% lymphocytes, 1% eosinophils, 1% basophils.
Differential shows: 2% Promyelocytes, 13% Myelocytes, 7% Metamyelocytes, 28% Bands/Neutrophils, 5% Plasma cells, 15% Lymphocytes, 25% Erythroid, 3% Eosinophils, 2% Basophils.
The lymphocyte count includes many large and atypical cells with Golgi crystalline inclusions and fragments of lymphocytes in the background.
Several of the plasma cells have the same inclusions as the lymphocytes.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
Additional material of unknown origin is observed on the terminal 18p and Xp; there is a deletion of terminal 2q, and an extra chromosome 3 in each of the abnormal cells.
+3 is seen in both B and T cell NHL.
[**2113-1-27**] CXR Basal segments of the right lower lobe are still severely atelectatic, though there has been some improved aeration since [**1-25**].
Oral contrast from prior CT scan is seen throughout the colon to the rectum.
[**2113-1-28**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
[**2113-1-29**] CXR One portable view.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 M with no significant established PMHx presents with 3 wk h/o fatigue, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, increasing dyspnea, and abdominal pain now found to have retropertioneal lymphadenopathy, small pleural effusions and large liver lesions concerning for possible lymphoma vs. systemic infection.
He underwent lymph node biopsy and was diagnosed with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (see pathology report above for more details).
Extensive infection work up was negative and the patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
There was no evidence of pericardial effusion on CT or TTE although he had mildly distended JVP.
ABG still showed a large A-a gradient of 300, saturation has been 100% on 10L oxygen.
Initial concern was for tamponade/pericardial effusion however prelim Echo reported no fluid collection.
CXR showed elevated right hemidiaphragm which on prior reports looks unchanged and reported as atelectasis.
CXR did show changes within the parenchyma.
Final echo ruled out tamponade.
Lower extremity ultrasound did not show evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
Oxygen saturation improved prior to diuresis with lasix.
An abdominal plain film showed mild constipation without evidence of obstruction or free air.
You will need to have frequent blood count checks to monitor your disease.
