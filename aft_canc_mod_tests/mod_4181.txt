A CT chest was performed showing multiple bilateral subsegmental PEs.
Past Medical History: Primary oncologist- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 69068**] at MSK - mesonephric adenocarcinoma dx [**2125**] s/p TAHBSO - [**2125**] chemotherapy with platinum and 5-FU and with radiation therapy to the pelvis - [**2126**] VATS wedge resections of the right middle lobe and left lower lobe for pulmonary mets - [**2128**]-[**2130**] several different chemotherapeutic regimens including avastin and gemcitabine most recently in [**3-16**] - PET-CT [**8-15**] showed at least 5 FDG avid lung nodules compatible with metastases - cyberknife therapy for palliation of SOB [**6-15**] - most recent chest imaging [**2133-1-5**] CT chest showed worsened mediastinal and pulmonary disease with 6x12cm right hilar mass that invades the posterior [**Last Name (un) **] of the left main PA.

Significant labs during hospital course: Hct 34 on admission, down to 26 after hemoptysis.
INR 1.2  Platelets 170-270 up until [**2133-1-16**].
WBC 9.4 on admission, drifted down to 3.9, was never neutropenic in house.
Cr 0.8 on admission, down to 0.5 but then acutely increased to 1.0 [**1-22**], renal function otherwise normal in house.
CT Head [**2133-1-9**]: Limited evaluation due to recirculation of intravenous contrast from previous CTA chest.
CXR [**1-27**]: Comparison with [**2133-1-23**].
CT Chest w/o contrast [**1-29**]: 1.
CXR [**2-1**]: Small left pneumothorax may be present, but not appreciably changed.
CXR s/p chest placed to water seal [**2133-2-2**]: There is no appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Large lung masses show little interval change except for recent cavitation.
Patient had multiple blood, sputum, BAL, and urine cultures sent during her admission.
Multiple cultures were never positive.
The patient could not be weaned from the vent, and after discussing the matter with the patient and her family, the team proceeded with a PEG and trach to allow her to be on mechanical ventilation chronically.
Her blood pressures are chronically in the 90s/50s.
Hemoptysis Hct decreased after acute presentation, but eventually stabilized around 22.
The team set a Hct of 21 as a parameter for RBC transfusion; she received a total of 1 unit of PRBCs during her course.
Hct stable at 22.1 on day of discharge.
# Tension Pneumothorax: Patient developed worsening of her tachycardia, with HR in 130s.
CXR revealed a left-sided pneumothorax with evidence of some tension.
Repeat imaging after catheter was clamped was difficult to interpret because of her extensive tumor burden, and a chest CT was obtained to better clarify the extent of her pneumothorax.
Chest tube was placed to water seal on [**2-2**] for transfer and follow up CXR was stable.
Nadir WBC was 3300 with no evidence of neutropenia.
Once culture data came back negative, antibiotics were stopped.
At the time of transfer, her white count was stable at 4200.
Renal ultrasound demonstrated mild left hydronephrosis.
She was given some IV fluids and managed expectantly, and her urine output and Cr improved.
Because of her tenuous blood pressures, the team is deferring diuresis for now with the hope that she will be able to tolerate lasix at another time.
