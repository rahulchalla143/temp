During the admission, she was noted to have a left peri-hilar mass on CXR as well as a left pleural effusion, and a chest CT revealed a 3.5x5cm left suprahilar mass with impingment on the LUL bronchus and subsequent LUL collapse.
She underwent bronchoscopy showing a large lesion involving the left mainstem bronchus and completely obstructing the LUL take-off.
On the following day, a chest x-ray showed total white-out of the left lung.

Tiny 3 to 4 mm nodular densities within the right lung base.
* [**2150-11-10**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2150-11-8**]: Left upper lobe has reexpanded.
1) Lung mass: Her presentation with long-standing smoking, lung mass, and presumptive SIADH was highly concerning for malignancy, and an appropriate work-up was continued.
A CT chest performed on [**11-10**] revealed a 3.4 x 2.9 cm peripherally enhancing lobulated mass causing obstruction of the left upper lobe bronchus and resulting in complete collapse/consolidation of the left upper lobe, with patent LLL bronchus.
Pleural fluid cytology from the OSH thoracentesis returned negative for malignancy, although only a small amount of fluid was obtained at that time.
CXR PA/lat post-procedure without complications.
Work-up otherwise remarkable for negative head CT, abdominal CT without liver mets, bilateral adrenal adenomas.
She does have a pleural effusion, likely malignant, and is awaiting an out-patient PET scan to complete her metastatic work-up and assess disease burden.
She reverted to NSR while in the ICU on [**11-10**], then back in afib on [**11-11**] with RVR with HR in 140s, and borderline low BP.
5) Hyponatremia: Urine electrolytes with elevated urine sodium, high urine osm, and low serum sodium was consistent with SIADH.
Her sodium has improved in the hospital with fluid restriction 1200 cc/day.
A random cortisol level of 21 ruled out adrenal insufficiency.
