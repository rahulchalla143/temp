Head CT [**2-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2-3**] CT head: IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT [**2-4**]: IMPRESSION: In comparison to [**2197-2-3**] exam, there is no significant change in acute on chronic right subdural hematoma.
[**2-5**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No change in exam compared to next preceding study with stable chronic bifrontal subdural hematomas and unchanged right frontal and parafalcine internal foci of hyperattenuation, suggesting more acute hemorrhage.
# acute on chronic Subdural hematoma: Pt was seen in ED by neurosurgery with recommendation for repeat scan in ED and in 24 hours that appeared stable per radiology, subsequent scans have also been stable.
However, given pt's CLL, on chemotherapy, and ?autoimmune component to thrombocytopenia for which patient had been on steroids as an outpt, this goal was not achievable and goal was set at 50 which transfusion prn to meet this goal and pt remained clinically stable with this goal with serial head CTs showing stability of SDH.
Repeat head CT was reassuring, as noted.
His systolic blood pressure was maintained < 140 mmHg.
Neurosurgery would like follow-up as an outpatient in 4-weeks, with head CT prior to appointment, given his clinical stability and noted no need for operative intervention.
Plt goal was >50 as it seemed near impossible to achieve goal of 100.
Several serial head CT's were stable.
Of note, neuro exam and clincal exam remained stable on the medical floor, but pt did experience times of delerium-see below.
Last plt transfusion [**2197-2-4**].
Discharge plt count 65. .
As above, plt goal is >50, and HCT goal >25.
Transitional care -at least daily monitoring of CBC to monitor for neutropenia, and need for transfusion of plt for plt <50 or PRBCs for HCT <25 -neurosurgery f/u in 4weeks with repeat head CT, scheduled -oncology f/u for CLL and continued instructions on prednisone taper, scheduled.
Caltrate 600 + D 600 mg(1,500mg) -400 unit Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO twice a day: while on steroids.
medication changes: 1.start keppra to prevent seizures 2.prednisone taper 3.start bactrim and calcium and vitamin d while on steroids .
