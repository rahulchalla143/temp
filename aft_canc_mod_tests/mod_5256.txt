He was not able to move his L-leg and L-arm and sounded dysarthric.
Upon arrival, his glc was 410.
His BP was 230-241/118-133.
He was given boluses of 20mg labetolol iv and then started on a drip to goal BP <185/<110.
A CT head was obtained that showed no bleed, mass effect, or developing infarct.
A CTA head and neck showed no occlusion of the intracranial vessels.
The patient agreed to proceed with tPA in case his BP and glucose could be controled in a timely fashion.
Around 10.30, his glucose was 380 and his BP was well controled to 171/89.

Head CT [**7-5**]: There is a 2 mm chronic lacunar infarct within the right lentiform nucleus.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK AND HEAD [**7-5**]: FINDINGS:  There is no definite contour abnormality involving the cervical carotid system on either side.
MRI Head [**7-5**]: A number of the conventional images are degraded by patient motion.
Nevertheless, the study clearly shows a comet-shaped area of restricted diffusion, with the "head" of the comet within the posterior body of the right caudate nucleus, extending anteroinferiorly across the posterior limb of the right internal capsule with the "tail" this lesion in the right lentiform nucleus.
Although the FLAIR images are of poor quality due to patient motion, there is slightly increased signal in this locale, consistent with a developing subacute phase of this lesion.
The right lentiform nucleus chronic lacunar infarct, previously noted on the CT scan is also imaged on this study.
Repeat CT Head [**7-6**]: Right caudate nucleus/posterior limb of internal capsule/lentiform nucleus hypodensity, indicative of evolving infarct corresponding to the comet-shaped region of restricted diffusion on the concurrent MR.
CXR [**7-7**]: Heart is top normal size.
Biopsy of this nodule is advised.
Repeat Head CT 24 hrs after tPA administration showed no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage.
There his exam was stable and on discharge pt.
In terms of stroke work-up, pt was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital stay with no evidence of A fib or other arrythmia.
FLP was checked and showed total cholesterol 144, triglycerides 201, HDL 30, LDL 74.
was started on a low dose Statin, and should have a repeat lipid panel checked by his PCP in follow up to evaluate its efficacy.
Once he was transferred to the floor he was started on Metformin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **], continued on Lantus, and his sliding scale was decreased and changed to a Humalog scale [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 9718**] recs.
Glucose was well controlled for several days prior to discharge, and pt.
He should have his fingersticks recorded at Rehab, and be given a log to take to his follow up with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] that his glucose control can be evaluated by them.
Pt's Thyroid mass was evaluted by ultrasound (see results above)  A thyroid panel was checked and showed TSH 12, T4 6.4, T3 104, free T4 0.9.
Repeat TFTs should be checked by [**Last Name (un) **] in follow up.
Cytology was pending at time of discharge and should be followed up by [**Last Name (un) **].
This titration should continue in rehab, with goal SBP 120-140, and continued on an outpatient basis.
Please call your doctor or go to the ER if you have any worsening of the numbness or weakness in your arm or leg, any changes in your vision, any fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or develop any other new symptoms that concern you.
