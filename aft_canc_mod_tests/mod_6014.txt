During her Intensive Care Unit course, the patient had four out of four blood cultures positive for Klebsiella and had a percutaneous nephrostomy to relieve left hydronephrosis and an Emergency Room CT scan which was negative for cholangitis.
On the day of transfer to the Intensive Care Unit she looked worse clinically with a saturation down to 91% on 50 liter face mask, on 90 to 93% on nonrebreather, and the Medical Intensive Care Unit team was asked to evaluate.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs upon transfer are temperature 100.8 F.; pulse 107; blood pressure 97/50; saturation of 93% on 100% nonrebreather; respiratory rate 25; arterial blood gas was 7.48, 30, 8, 58.
Fingerstick was 109.
Pulmonary:  Bronchial breath sounds in left base with egophony and dullness to percussion in the left base; otherwise clear to auscultation.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 33.4, hematocrit 25.8, platelets 386, INR 1.4.
Chem 7 was sodium 138, potassium 3.9, chloride 97, bicarbonate 28, BUN 8, creatinine 0.5, glucose 94.
ALT 15, AST 28, LD 557, alkaline phosphatase 203, total bilirubin 2.0, amylase 75, lipase 44.
Repeat chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe consolidation, patchy bilateral infiltrates versus pulmonary edema.
Micro-data was unrevealing since four of four blood cultures positive on [**3-1**] for Klebsiella.
CT scan of the abdomen on [**3-8**] revealed left lower lobe atelectasis, small bilateral pleural effusions and numerable liver metastases and spleen metastases and interval resolution of left hydronephrosis.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was negative.
The patient's initial lactates were in the 2 range and she was given one unit of packed red blood cells for her low hematocrit.
She was able to provide sputum which did not grow out anything and after diuresis she did well.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction with impair left atrial relaxation and so it was assumed that the diastolic congestive heart failure could be related to her respiratory failure.
The patient also had Gentamicin initially started upon transfer to the unit, however, this was discontinued along with AmBisome on [**3-11**] and the MUST protocol was discontinued on [**3-10**] as she was afebrile, her blood pressure stable and her lactate was only 1.2.
around the clock which seemed to hold her blood pressure up better.
Her bilirubin was rising in the unit to a high of 2.4, however, it had started to fall after this and no other interventions were done.
Her INR was elevated to a high of 1.6, however, dropped back down to 1.3 after 5 mg of Vitamin K subcutaneously.
Other liver function tests were stable in the unit.
LEFT PICC LINE AND A-LINE:  Right IJ triple lumen catheter was pulled once a left PICC line was placed and tip sent for culture which never grew out anything.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:   Urine culture positive for yeast on [**3-9**]; the Foley catheter was replaced and a recheck of urinalysis was negative.
Repeat urine cultures did not grow out anything and so she was not started on any anti-fungals for this.
