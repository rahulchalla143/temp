In the ED, T 98.3 HR 110 irregular BP 72/43 RR 18 O2 99%/RA.
Labs showed elevated LFTs with Tbili 7.7 up from baseline 0.9 and alk phos 474 up from 261.
ABG 7.35/pCO2 41/pO2 62/HCO3 24.
RUQ US showed contracted gallbladder with thickened wall and sludge with possible stones.
Blood pressure was low with SBP in the 70s but patient asymptomatic.
BP improved with 6L IVF and 0.6 mg/hr levophed, VS at time of ED transfer were HR 108 MAP 89 BP 111/82 O2 96%/RA.
Creatinine elevated to 3.8 (past max 4.0, CKD), urine output 20-30 cc/hr.
Surgery consulted, requested CT abdomen, deemed pt a non-operable candidate, and suggested ERCP.
His labs were notable for a very high alk phos, and CT disclosed multiple lesions in the liver and pancreatic head fullness.
An EUS was performed which disclosed a 2cm mass in the head of the pancreas; FNA was performed and returned as adenocarcinoma.

[**9-8**] CXR for ?PNA ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lungs are well inflated in the upper zones with bilateral lower lobe opacities.
Evaluation of the pancreas is limited due to overlying bowel gas.
Limited evaluation of the pancreas due to overlying bowel gas.
[**9-8**] CT ABD non-contrast CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are identified with associated compressive atelectasis.
Complete evaluation of the abdominal viscera is limited due to the non-contrast technique.
An exophytic lesion in the lower pole of the left kidney also appears unchanged and measures 2.2 x 2.3 cm, likely a simple cyst (2:42).
The abdominal aorta demonstrates mild ectasia, though no frank aneurysmal dilatation.
[**2198-9-9**] ERCP Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal Major Papilla: A metal stent placed in the biliary duct was found in the major papilla.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
Partial opacification of the upper third of the duct and birfucation showed on evidence of obstruction proximal to the stent.
Obstruction of recently-placed metal CBD stent seen on CT provides a good explanation for elevated bilirubin and acute cholangitis.
Patient's hypotension on admission responded well to 5L IVF in the ED but he continued to require levophed at 0.1 mg/hr to maintain SBP >90 and MAP>60 during the first 24h the ICU.
IVF was given judiciously for low urine output/hypotension due pt history of moderate aortic stenosis/chronic pleural effusions.
Blood cultures sent in the ED grew GNR.
CBD stent placed in [**2198-4-17**] was seen on CT abdomen to be obstructing biliary flow.
Immediately following ERCP LFTs trended upward, tbili max 9.7, and decreased to 7, but then had proceeded to increase to 13.2 with elevated d bili above 11.
Given goals of care, decision was made to not proceed with further imaging or repeat ERCP.
Lopressor stopped because of relative hypotension on floor (Bps 90s) and heart rates that remain <100.
Last BM was three days prior to admission; a stool-filled colon was seen on CT Abd.
Baseline Cr [**4-20**].
Urine output monitered by foley.
Based on the patient's multiple co-morbidities and poor prognosis, discussions were held with him and his family about goals of care.
