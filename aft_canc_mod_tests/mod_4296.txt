He originally went to his PCP and had an ultrasound on [**2177-3-6**] which showed moderate to severe dilation of the intrahepatic ducts and a CBD of 1.7cm.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up and treatment of this new finding.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient was transfered from an Outside Hopsital and admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2177-3-12**] for further evaluation and treatment of a newly discovered ulcerating ampullary mass on ERCP at the OSH.
On [**2177-3-13**], the patient underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which showed massively dilated intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts.
On [**2177-3-14**], a CTA pancreas protocol was completed, which confirmed the ampullary mass with adluscent duodenal involvement.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
The JP drain to bulb suction remained in place; a culture sent on [**2177-3-31**] grew moderate [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans; treatment of this was deferred.
An abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast performed on [**2177-4-2**] showed a number of small fluid collections extending from the porta hepatis and near the ruox limb, but was otherwsie unremarkable.
ID/INTEG: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
