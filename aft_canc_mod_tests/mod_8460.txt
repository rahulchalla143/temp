In [**2164-11-2**], the patient had an MRI which showed thickening of the bladder wall, involvement of potential submucosal layers with extension to perivesicular fat, severe hydronephrosis on the left side with a minimal functioning left kidney.
The patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABS:  BUN and creatinine 19 and 1.0, potassium 4.0, creatinine clearance 111 cc/min.
Postoperative day #1 and #2, the patient afebrile, vital signs stable, slowly weaning off ventilator, good urine output coming out of right ureteral stent.
A repeat chest x-ray showed significant improvement in pulmonary edema and pleural effusion.
The rechecked creatinine showed increased rise compared to the first few postoperative days.
It was felt that the patient's BUN and creatinine rise was probably a combination of systemic absorption of urine in the peritoneum, as well as some edema in the ureter post stent removal.
The patient had an ultrasound performed which showed minimal to mild hydronephrosis.
Still had some CVA tenderness to palpation but nothing at rest.
His output had changed and he was now mostly putting out urine out of Foley and JP tube.
There was a consideration for percutaneous drainage of right kidney due to acute renal failure; however, on the evening of postop day #9, the patient's BUN and creatinine started to decline, so it was decided to hold.
BUN and creatinine slowly going down.
His saturation dropped to 86-88% on room air.
He had another chest x-ray which showed evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia.
Because of a high suspicion, the patient had a VQ scan which had moderate to high probability of left upper lobe PE, as well as some filling defects in the right lung.
On postop day #13, the patient was afebrile, vital signs, Foley and SP were draining well (most urine coming out of Foley).
