CT of the chest showed no drainable collections.
He therefore had a chest x-ray that showed a right upper lobe mass which was followed by a CAT scan that showed a 2.2 x 1.9 cm right upper lobe nodule as well as a 7.5 x 4.4 x 6-cm soft tissue lesion in the anterior right chest wall anterior to the right clavicle, also diffuse moderate emphysema.
This was followed by a PET scan on [**2169-3-2**], which revealed an FDG-avid nodule in the right upper lobe with a maximal SUV of 24.6 that measured 2.2 x 1.9 cm, also a right hilar 9 mm lymph node with an SUV of 8.9 as well as increased activity in the sternal area in the surgically created muscle flap at the patient's sternal resection site.
He then underwent mediastinoscopy on [**2169-3-6**] with bronchial washings, which were negative, and also had an I&D and sternal debridement.

CT Chest [**2169-6-16**]: FINDINGS: The soft tissue mass in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe previously measuring 3.2 x 1.8 cm is almost completely resolved, now 0.5 x 1 cm with a fiducial marker in it.
Bilateral basal atelectasis, left greater than right, is grossly stable.
MRI Chest [**2169-6-20**]: FINDINGS: There has been no significant change from prior chest CT dated [**2169-6-16**].
Limited imaging through the upper abdomen demonstrates no significant abnormality.
IMPRESSION: No significant change from prior CT examination dated [**2169-6-16**].
Evaluation of the reformatted images on a separate workstation were valuable in delineating the anatomy.
Ultrasound confirmed the left basilic vein was patent and compressible.
His SBP however was stable in the 120s with a lactate of 1.0.
CT of torso and CXR were unrevealing of any clear source of infxn but large soft tissue collection in anterior chest was visualized and read as a possible abscess vs iatrogenic tract formation.
Head CT was negative for any acute change on admission.
MRI of the pts sternum was ordered and revealed soft tissue enhancement in the anterior chest wall.
His stool was sent for C dificile antigen and the results are pending at the time of discharge.
There was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect on CT of the head on admission.
These were restarted sequentially on HD2 and 3 as his blood pressure tolerated.
#DMII: On admission the pts metformin 1000 [**Hospital1 **] was held given his recent contrast given on [**6-16**] for CT.
His CT shows resolution of the 2 R lung masses, although there is a new RML nodule which denotes a mixed response.
#Anemia: Pt has baseline anemia with hct 25-30.
The pts hct slowly dropped back down to 26 so he received 1 unit of PRBC on [**6-24**] with his hct rising up to 29. .
