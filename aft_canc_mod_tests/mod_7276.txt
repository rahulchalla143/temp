Her PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) 1459**] ordered a CT that showed a 13x8 cm medistinal mass with invasion of the pericardium, ?
compression of the SVC and small left pleural effusion.
She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.

Her work-up revealed a 13x8cm mass in mediastinum with pericardial infiltration, SVD compression and bilateral pleural effusion.
The patient subsequently underwent medianoscopy with biopsy of the mass.
Pan-CT studies and bone marrow biopsy did not show any evidence for other organ/marrow involvement.
Initially it was thought that the patient also had lower extremity deep vein thromboses but multiple subsequent ultrasound studies of the legs did not show any clots.
A CT-angiogram on day of admission was negative for pulmonary emboli.
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 105351**] developed some tachycardia and O2-desaturation to 88% after the rate of rituxan was increased to 150mg/h, but after reducing the rate to 100mg/ml and supportive therapy she improved rapidly and received the whole dose of rituxan (375mg/m2).
Serologies for hepatitis as well as an ultrasound of the liver were negative.
Furthermore, the liver function tests improved with treatment, so the initial elevation was attributed to compression of the superior vena cava and congestion of the liver.
Since the site of the pain also was different from the site of her bone marrow biopsy and the patient had no redness of the skin, we attributed the pain to effects of prolonged bedrest and uncomfortable position due to the femoral line.
