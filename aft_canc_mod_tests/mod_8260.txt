His CT chest scan suggested b/l lung necrosis and cavitary lesions, w/ right hydropneumothorax and L pleural effusion.
Infectious disease was consulting along with the primary team, and agreed with the following Abx regimen to treat PNA attributed to pseudomonas/stenotrophomonas/possible invasive aspergillosis:  Abx regimen and projected duration: - Sulfameth/Trimethoprim Suspension 120 mL PO/NG QHD - Cefepime 1gm IV q24h (give after HD on HD days) start date: [**2124-3-29**] stop date:  [**2124-5-10**]  - Voriconazole 200mg PO q12h start date: [**2124-4-12**] stop date:  ongoing pending [**Hospital1 18**] ID f/u .
Although he was not oliguric, he was uremic with Cr ~4 for several weeks.
Thus, he needs to be monitored for signs of kidney recovery (including better UOP and improvement in pre-HD labs), as well as avoidance nephrotoxins and contrast.
#) Bacteremias: His OSH cultures were positive for MSSA on [**3-16**].
TTE negative for vegetation, and TEE was not performed as there was no strong suspicion for endocarditis.
RIJ CVL was removed [**2124-3-21**], placed a new LIJ CVL [**2124-3-21**], removed [**3-30**].
His TSH and LFTs were WNL.
However, he may have had diffuse bleeding from multiple sites related to mucositis [**12-23**] chemotherapy.
He required a total of 20 blood transfusions during this hospitalization (was being transfused for Hct <21).
His uremic platelets may have exacerbated this; his coags and PLT counts remained nl however.
Abx regimen and projected duration: - Sulfameth/Trimethoprim Suspension 120 mL PO/NG QHD - Cefepime 1gm IV q24h (give after HD on HD days) start date: [**2124-3-29**] stop date:  [**2124-5-10**]  - Voriconazole 200mg PO q12h start date: [**2124-4-12**] stop date:  ongoing pending [**Hospital1 18**] ID f/u .
Laboratory monitoring required Frequency: Weekly - CBC - BMP - LFTs - Voriconazole trough levels  All laboratory results should be faxed to Infectious disease R.Ns.
-Pt will need a voriconazole level drawn on Monday [**2124-4-17**] .
