Post-chemo, the pt was noted to be progressively pancytopenic requiring every other day transfusions of blood products.
On [**2-17**] at rehab, pt had T 102F, HR 120-130s, blood cxs sent.
This am, T to 103F, HR 150s, BP 122/63, and pt mostly non-verbal (at baseline oriented to self).

Labs significant for WBC 1.3 with 0% neutrophils and bands, Hct 23.9, Plt 40, lactate 3.9.
A port CXR showed a developing retrocardiac opacity.
After 5L IVFs, the pt's HR decreased to the 120-130s, RR improved to 18-22, and O2 sat 100% on 2L NC.
Given relative hemodynamic stability and plts < 50K, a CVL was not placed in the ED.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.
During that admission he reported numbness of his left shoulder as well as bilateral fingertip numbness, thought to be due to vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy, not a central process (MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 11580**]).
His second cycle of R-IVAC was complicated by neutropenic sepsis and blood cultures grew out both MRSA and Citrobacter.
