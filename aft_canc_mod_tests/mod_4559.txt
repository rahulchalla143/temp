Patient has a left lung mass identified on CT scan in [**6-1**] at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
The scan showed left upper lobe consolidation with occlusion of the bronchus.
Following that hospitalization, the patient underwent a bronchoscopy with tissue biopsy of the mass in [**7-1**] which was non-diagnostic.
The tissue pathology showed acute and chronic inflammation with necrosis but no evidence of neoplasm.
She notes that she intermittently coughs up a significnat amount of blood, difficult to quantify but more than a spoonfool ("more like a shovel"); after a while, the coughing settles down and less and less blood comes out, and she may not cough again for a couple more days.
CT Chest showed LUL collapse with hilar lesion.

1.5-cm right upper lobe ground-glass nodule, which is nonspecific and may be neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
If clinicallly indicated, an MRI of the liver can be performed for further evaluation.
CXR [**2179-11-27**]:REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient with bronchoscopy due to suspected lung cancer and multiple myeloma.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to several prior studies obtained on [**11-25**] and [**2179-11-26**] The patient was extubated in the meantime interval.
[**2179-11-26**] Pathology of lung mass: Pending at time of discharge Final report on [**2179-12-3**] 1.
Lung, left main stem mass and blood clot (A-B): - Adenocarcinoma, well differentiated, small fragments.
However, immunoperoxidase studies show the tumor to be CK7, CDX2 (very focally) positive; ER and PR stains are positive as well; TTF-1 and CK20 are negative.
Hemoptysis and Left Lung Mass: The patient has a known lung mass found on CT scan at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital and chronic cough with acute onset of worsening hemoptysis.
On admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a HCT of 30, stable vital signs, and satting in the high 90's on room air.
Following the evacuation of the blood clot there was active bleeding and the patient was intubated to secure her airway.
A sputum gram stain and culture were sent and were contaminated with oropharygeal flora.
The results of her tissue pathology are still pending and she will follow-up with [**Hospital1 18**] cardiothoracics and interventional pulmonology one week following discharge.
Anemia: The patient had a normocytic anemia with HCT of 30 on admission.
Her OSH records indicate that she was anemic during her last hospitalization in [**6-1**] and was discharged with a HCT in the 30s.
Iron studies indicated an iron deficiency anemia.
Hematocrit remained relatively stable and was 28.5 at d/c.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure The patient's creatinine was 1.2 on admission, however, decreased to 1.1.
This appeared to be consistent with prerenal etiology, however, the patient's FeUrea was 0.45, which is more consistent with intrinsic renal injury.
on discharge her creatinine was 0.9.
She was monitored on telemetry without any events.
Benign Hypertension: Her blood pressure was well-controlled during this hospitalization.
Medications on Admission: -Atenolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] -Tricor (fenofibrate) 48mg DAILY -Zocor (simvastatin) 20 mg DAILY -Lisinopril 20mg DAILY -KCl 2.5mg 4 TABS TID -Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg DAILY -Levoxyl (levothyroxine) 100mcg DAILY -Furosemide 20mg DAILY -Allopurinol 100mg DAILY -Ecotrin (ASA) 325mg DAILY -Robutussin (OTC)  Discharge Medications: 1.
The results from the lung mass biopsy have not returned yet, however, your thoracic surgeon will go over these results with you when they return.
Followup Instructions: Please remember to keep the following appointments with the thoracic surgeon and interventional pulmonologist:  Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 1532**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 1533**], MD Phone:[**0-0-**] Date/Time:[**2179-12-7**] 9:00am Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 12554**] CLINIC INTERVENTIONAL PULMONARY (SB) Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3020**] Date/Time:[**2179-12-7**] 9:30am  Please also follow up with your primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4467**].
