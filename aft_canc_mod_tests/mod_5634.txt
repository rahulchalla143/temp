She had a routine staging CT this AM which showed pulmonary infiltrate and pleural effusion and is therefore being directly admitted from clinic.
While in the hospital, she underwent an abdominal ultrasound, which showed increase in size of the common bile duct, suspicious for an obstructive process.
She underwent abdominal MRI on [**2159-11-22**], which showed a segment VIII hepatic lesion which was compatible with cholangiocarcinoma.

IMAGING [**2160-6-6**] CT ABD & PELVIS W & W/O CONTRAST, CT CHEST W/CONTRAST: Overall progression of disease with new diffuse tumor infiltration in the right hepatic lobe with metastatic foci in the left hepatic lobe.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2160-4-8**] the rate has increased.
Lateral ST segment depressions are not as prominent on the current tracing.
[**2160-6-9**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: No CT evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (LVEF>75%)..
[**2160-6-11**] EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of severe diffuse encephalopathy.
[**2160-6-15**] EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study which shows a generally attenuated background with frequent generalized periodic epileptiform discharges indicative of severe encephalopathy with generalized epileptogenic potential.
They did not evolve to form electrographic seizures and did not appear to have an obvious clinical correlate on video.
CYTOLOGY [**2160-6-7**] PLEURAL FLUID: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4587**] was a 58 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma, Hep B/C/EtOH cirrhosis, and alcohol abuse who presented from clinic with shortness of breath after a routine CT showed new right-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary infiltrates.
CT scan showed multifocal pneumonia.
A 20min EEG was performed which showed epileptiform activity.
CT head and LP were non-revealing.
