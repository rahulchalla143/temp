[**2119-5-9**] Diagnostic laparoscopy with conversion to Open Cholecystectomy.
A CTA was preformed, demonstrating a type A dissection.

Further evaluation of thoracic spine previous study was limited.
TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial images of the thoracic spine obtained.
Comparison was made with the MRI of [**2119-5-25**].
Comparison is made to recent head CT of [**2119-5-17**] as well as most recent CT torso of [**2119-5-17**].
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through the thoracic and lumbar spine.
MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE  Please note the thoracic spine images are largely motion degraded related to patient motion as well as CSF pulsation artifact.
Increased signal is noted on the scout HASTE images within the aortic arch which likely relates to blood/hematoma from the patient's known dissection.
MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE: Conus medullaris terminates at approximately L1-L2 interspace of the distal cord and exiting nerve roots appear unremarkable.
Difficult evaluation of the signal within the thoracic cord due to motion and pulsation artifacts.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
COMPARISON: CT torso [**2119-5-7**].
TECHNIQUE: Helical imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet through the pubic symphysis after oral contrast administration.
CT ABDOMEN: Lack of IV contrast limits evaluation of solid intra-abdominal organs.
There are scattered retroperitoneal and mesenteric nodes, none of which reach CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT PELVIS: Simple fluid tracks into the pelvis again new since prior examination.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Neurology was consulted and a CT of the head showed no acute intracranial process.
Follow up head CT scan was notable for small subarachnoid hemorrhage but not indicative of loss of right leg function, spine was consulted and MRI did not reveal infarct.
Follow up head CT showed resolution of subarachnoid bleed when on heparin and coumadin.
Pan-cultures were obtained and the ID service was consulted.
Speech and swallow examination revealed possible silent aspiration and strict NPO was recommended.
The patient subsequently passed a speech and swallow evaluation and tube feeds were discontinued once adequate PO intake was established.
