One day prior to admission at the [**Hospital1 2177**], he was seen in Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic for a complaint of increasing lethargy and shortness of breath; a chest x-ray done at that time demonstrated a new left lung air/fluid level.
A bronchoscopy done [**2149-11-13**] at [**Hospital1 2177**] demonstrated blood in the trachea, middle right-sided blood without active bleeding, and white, friable mucosa in the left main stem bronchus with narrowing of the lumen, significant enough to prevent passage of the bronchoscope; blood was seen distal to the obstruction.
On [**2149-11-14**], a bronchial artery angiogram was performed with a goal of embolizing the bleeding source.
On the night prior to transfer to the [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient had an additional 300 cc of hemoptysis with an associated drop in his systolic blood pressure to the 80s and was therefore started on a Dopamine drip.
