Admission Date:  [**2116-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-1-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Demerol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**] Chief Complaint: Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Diagnostic laparoscopy and small bowel resection with stapled side-to-side anastomosis.
He underwent a colonoscopy that showed extensive blood throughout the entire colon, and intubation of the terminal ileum showed blood coming from above.
An upper endoscopy of the stomach and duodenum was unremarkable.
He underwent a GI bleeding study on the night of his admission that showed immediate tracer activity within the left upper quadrant and over the next 90 minutes, the activity proceeded toward the right lower quadrant suggestive of a bleeding source in the proximal small bowel, perhaps near the ligament of Treitz.
He then underwent a mesenteric arteriogram which showed no extravasation of contrast.
This was communicated to the medical ICU team and they obtained a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**8-17**].
I advised a diagnostic laparoscopy and a laparoscopic-assisted small bowel resection and Dr. [**Known lastname **] consented to proceed.
Colonoscopy [**8-16**]: There was blood throughout the colon.
Mesenteric Angiogram [**8-17**]: WET READ - Diagnostic angiogram performed in the celiac trunk, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and SMA reveals no evidence of extravasation of contrast to suggest a localizable focus of GI bleed.
CT abd ([**8-17**]): 3.5-cm enhancing soft tissue mass in the left upper quadrant mesentery, appears to bulge into the lumen of the splenic flexure of the colon, possibly into adjacent small bowel loops in the left upper abdomen.

SBP down to 60.
Pt counseled on need for blood transfusion.
Received 2 units Intermittent HCT checked between blood units, found to be in 20's.
On morning of HOD2, pt underwent a mesenteric angiogram where [**Female First Name (un) 899**], SMA, & celiac access were injected.
CT of ABD performed to look for other bleeding sources.
The segment of jejenum where the GIST was located was resected and an extracorporeal primary stapled anastamosis was performed through a mini-midline incision.
