Cardiovascular examination revealed she was tachycardic, normal first heart sound and second heart sound.
Extremity examination revealed good capillary refill with no lower extremity edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratory values on admission revealed white blood cell count was 1.2, hemoglobin was 10.5, hematocrit was 30.8, and platelets were 190.
The differential on the white blood cell count revealed 20% neutrophils, 30% bands, 22% lymphocytes, and 26% monocytes.
Her chemistry panel revealed sodium was 131, potassium was 6.2 (with a recheck of 3.3), chloride was 93, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 25, creatinine was 0.9, and blood glucose was 105.
Absolute neutrophil count was 250.
PT was 14.9, PTT was 29.3, INR was 1.5.
LDH was 795, total bilirubin was 0.9, AST was 54, ALT was 17, alkaline phosphatase was 142.
Calcium was 9, phosphorous was 3.2, magnesium was 2.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  During hospitalization, a chest x-ray on admission showed post radiation changes in the left perihilar region with hazy areas of increased opacity in the lower lobe (the right greater than the left, possibly indicating pneumonia; however, unable to access to motion artifact.
A [**Month/Day (1) 500**] scan on [**2109-12-24**] revealed no new metastases with improvement in known metastases in the left pelvis and T11.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the head on [**2109-12-23**] revealed no evidence of new metastases.
Stable postoperative changes in the left cerebellar hemisphere, air/fluid levels in maxillary sinus, and stable right parafalcine hemangioma.
An transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2109-12-20**] revealed an ejection fraction of 60% to 65%, 1+ aortic regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Electrocardiogram on admission revealed sinus tachycardia and early R wave progression.
No ST-T wave changes compared to electrocardiogram dated [**2109-1-21**].
On hospital day two, she was noted to have progressive worsening of respiratory distress, and an arterial blood gas was performed which showed a pH of 7.22, a PCO2 of 61, and a PO2 of 354, and a bicarbonate of 26.
Of note, her chest x-rays consistently showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm which appeared chronic in nature and was likely secondary to radiation-induced changes.
Her liver metastases appeared to be improving with chemotherapy, and her last cycle was on [**2109-12-12**] (five days prior to admission).
While in house, she had an evaluation of progression of cancer with a magnetic resonance imaging of the head which showed no new metastatic disease and a [**Year (4 digits) 500**] scan which showed no new metastases as well as improvement in known metastases in T11 and left pelvis when compared to a [**Year (4 digits) 500**] scan dated [**2109-6-14**].
Her admission laboratories were notable for a bandemia of 30%, and an absolute neutrophil count of 250.
She had repeat blood cultures which were all negative for growth, and a urinalysis which was unremarkable.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, she had a sputum culture which grew out yeast and was thought to be oropharyngeal in origin given her inhaled steroid use.
A viral culture was also performed and was negative for organisms.
Her electrocardiogram was without changes.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on [**2109-12-20**] for evaluation of congestive heart failure given her symptoms of acute shortness of breath and diffuse rales on examination.
The echocardiogram showed no evidence of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 65%, and no significant valvular abnormalities.
Her diltiazem was titrated up as her blood pressure would allow, and she was back on her outpatient regimen of diltiazem-XL 180 mg p.o.
A fractional excretion of sodium was performed on several occasions, and she was found to be less than 0.1%; indicating a volume depletion.
She was aggressively fluid rehydrated, and her creatinine fell to 1.4.
The etiology of her bump in creatinine was unknown; however, it was temporally related to two doses of intravenous Lasix.
Urine eosinophils were drawn to rule out acute interstitial nephritis, and were initially found to be negative.
It was thought that she may need an outpatient referral to the [**Hospital 10701**] Clinic if her creatinine remains consistently elevated.
Her Coumadin dose was increased, and her INR bumped to 9.
Her INR remained stable around 2 for the remainder of her hospitalization.
The patient's admission hematocrit was read around baseline of 30; however, her hematocrit fell to 26, and she was given 2 units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate response.
A heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody was negative.
Her liver function tests were within the normal range during this hospitalization.
There were no focal deficits on examination, and a repeat magnetic resonance imaging on [**2109-12-23**] showed no new disease.
fingersticks secondary to high-dose steroids for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare and was found on several occasions to have blood sugars in the 50s.
She was completely asymptomatic at this time, and repeat fingersticks revealed glucoses of around 70.
She did not require home oxygen at this time as her oxygen saturations remained 95% to 98% on room air at the time of discharge.
