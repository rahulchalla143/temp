CT Torso [**4-18**] 1.
MRI Head [**4-21**] 1.
CT Head [**4-23**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT head [**5-2**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Meningeal inflammation cannot be excluded on this non-contrast study.
Culture data only revealed Eneterococcus in the urine sensitive to Vancomycin.
CT Torso was unremarkable and blood cultures were negative.
LP was not consistent with bacterial meningitis, but since WBC was poly predominant meningitis doses of antibiotics were administered.
Viral studies and CSF culture data were negative.
An EEG revaled that patient was in nonconvulsive status epelepticus.
An MRI head revealed signs consistent with CNS lymphoma and CSF revealed atypical cells.
She was given aggressive hydration with bicarb solution to keep her urine alkalinized (pH>8.0), promoting elimination of methotrexate.
Despite this, serial levels showed that the clearance of methotrexate was delayed.
[**5-2**]: CT scan did not show any acute changes.
24hr video EEG monitoring was begun.
EEG monitoring was continued.
A lumbar puncture was performed for interval check of lymphoma in CNS and pt was also given IT Ara-C. [**5-4**]: Pt remained in status despite the multiple anti-epileptics and pt was transferred to the ICU for phenobarbital administration.
Portions of her neuro exam improved slowly, and when her level fell to 16 she was able to follow simple commands.
She had a repeat MRI that was unchanged.
Phenobarbital levels trended down.
On [**4-15**], blood cultures grew gram positive cocci in short chains and pairs, suspicious for VRE.
