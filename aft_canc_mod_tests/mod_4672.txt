LLE tib-fib films showed chronic osteomyelitis without subcutaneous gas, and a CXR showed stable bilateral effusions from earlier this month.
Blood cultures drawn prior to antibiotics.
Of note, he is in the midst of a azacitidine cycle for his AML, which was diagnosed in [**2170**].
He saw his oncologist yesterday, who's note details a pressure of 94/64.

Imaging: Tib/fib X-ray [**2171-7-10**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-13**], there is little overall change.
CXR [**2171-7-10**]: IMPRESSION: Little change except possibly for some small increase in left effusion.
Note 1/2 blood cultures grew Staph coag negative (sensitive to oxacillin and tetracycline), presumed to be a contaminant rather than actual bacteremia.
Echocardiogram was deferred due to lack of suspicion for endocarditis and MRI leg was not pursued due to clinical improvement on antibiotics and patient resistance to surgical debridement.
# HYPOTENSION:  Initial systolic blood pressure 80-90's prompted ICU admission, he received intravenous fluids and improved.
Note recent blood pressures prior to admission have been low, so there is a question of whether SBP 90-100 is his baseline.
Lasix was resumed [**2171-7-13**] once blood pressure was deemed stable.
His hematocrit was 24 for several days of admission.
His CBC and ANC should be monitored daily for 3 days upon discharge.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check vancomycin trough on Saturday [**2171-7-20**] Please fax results to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 47034**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Infectious Disease at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**].
Please check labs weekly CBC with differential, chem 7, LFTS and vancomycin trough, while on intravenous antibiotics.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check daily CBC with differential for 3 days to monitor his hematocrit, white blood cell count, and absolute neutrophil count.
You had low blood pressure which responded to intravenous fluids.
