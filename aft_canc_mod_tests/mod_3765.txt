The patient states that she has had a persistent cough since her lung biopsy performed three weeks ago.
She was initially diagnosed w/ NSCLC [**6-25**] due to 3 weeks of an intractable dry cough.
In [**7-25**] she also had MRI of brain which showed small right cerebellar metastasis.
On [**8-17**], day [**2-25**] for her XRT she was note to have a temp of 100.4 w/ a persistent productive cough.
At that time a CXR showed LUL density and she was started emprically on levofloxacin.
She persisted to have fevers with chills while taking tylenol and [**8-23**] had a temp of 102 and came to ED.
IN ED she was found to have temp 100.4, HR 115-125, BP 123/61, RR 32, 92% RA.
She was found to have a WBC of 14k, HCT 32, D-dimer > 8000, lactate of 2.5, ABG 7.49/33/66 on 4L NC.
CXR also showed new LLL retrocardiac density.
ECG showed sinus tachycardia, low voltage (previously present), and new Q waves in V2-V4 compared to EKG from [**2123-7-16**].
CTA angio not performed b/c pt has a hx of hives from contrast allergy in past.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
Recommend correlation with outside studies 3.
The density obliterates partially also the aorta and the mediastinal structures.
Comparison with the next previous AP single chest view obtained on [**2123-9-2**], both the atelectasis in the left upper lobe and the hilar density appear to have increased.

Urine cultures (5) negative, except for 1 which had yeast.
BAL fluid grew no bacteria, but did grow [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
Pleural fluid culture negative.
An echo was done which showed no evidence of right heart strain.
Due to a recent study in the NEJM, which showed a benefit of LMWH over coumadin in cancer patients at preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism, she was started on Lovenox instead of coumadin.
SHe also continued to require oxygen to keep her sats up.
No other source of infection was identified, as she had negative blood cultures, negative urine cultures, and no obvious source of cellulitis/skin involvement.
A BAL was performed and grew no bacteria, but did grow [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
Repeat CXRs showed a growing pleural effusion on the left.
Multiple blood cultures and urine cultures continued to be sent with no growth.
She was having no dysuria or abdominal pain, and a lactate was sent and normal.
She had had the fevers as an outpatient though, and none of her drugs were suspicious for causing fevers.
Also, the candidal lung infection was considered, but her symptoms showed no improvement despite high dose IV fluconazole.
She had an echo which showed no wall motion abnormalities and her cardiac enzymes checked.
Her troponins were mildly elevated, and this was felt to be a leak from the strain she was under from the PEs as opposed to an actual MI.
Iron studies were sent and showed a combination of anemia of chronic disease and possible iron deficiency anemias.
Hemolysis labs were sent and did not indicate hemolysis.
She was transfused on two separate occasions to keep her Hct up.
She had an initial MRI at an outpatient center that suggested the presence of a brain met.
The MRI was repeated here on superior equipment, and there was no evidence of any metastases to the brain.
Near the end of her stay, a planning CT done by rad onc suggested progression of disease rather than regression.
Her chemo was changed as was her radiation portal.
A follow-up CT will also be done as an outpatient, as she wasn't able to get one as an inpatient.
Enoxaparin Sodium 80 mg/0.8 mL Syringe Sig: One (1) injection Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours).
Her O2 requirement is 3LNC and stable.
Her cough is still present and productive, but also stable.
