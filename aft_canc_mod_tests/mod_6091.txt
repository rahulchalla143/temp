Further imaging studies of the brain showed a lytic lesion in the skull measuring 5 cm.
On [**4-21**] she had a radical left nephrectomy which involved entry into the chest and placement of a Chest tube; transfused 2 units in the OR.
Chest tube was pulled on [**4-23**] wuth subsequent CXR revealing 30% pneumothorax and new atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
New tachycardia to the 130s prompted a repeat CXR which demonstrated new opacity over entire left lung field.
She was given lopressor 5mg IV and HR decreased to low 100s; O2 sat improved to mid 90s on 2L nc with coughing.
Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further mgt and bronchoscopy.
Vitals at initial evaluation: 99.9, 136/76, HR 135-->100s, 16, 97% face mask.
Subsequently, O2 sats on 50%FM 90-95% and remained tachycardic 120s (sinus) so was bolused with IVF.
She received Vitamin K (5mg, then 10mg) for INR 2s.
After multiple IVF boluses, HR came down slightly to 90s-100s and HCT was stable so she was subsequwntly called out to floor, initially to hospitalist service then transferred to OMED.

[**4-22**] CXR:FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-21**], following placement of the chest tube to waterseal, there may be a very tiny left apical pneumothorax medially, though this would be of no clinical significance.
The striking prominence of the hila bilaterally is consistent with extensive lymphadenopathy seen on the CT of [**2183-4-11**].
Equivocal lucency in the left anterior/subtrochanteric femur without definite corresponding lesion on the recent CT scan.
Attention to this area on followup xray examination or, alternatively, if desired, further assessment with MR imaging could be performed.
The patient's urine output remained excellent.
On [**2183-4-23**], the chest tube was removed, and post-pull CXR showed a 20-30% PTX and new left lower lobe collapse, likely from mucus plugging.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: On [**4-21**] she had a radical left nephrectomy which involved entry into the chest and placement of a Chest tube; transfused 2 units in the OR.
Chest tube was pulled on [**4-23**] wuth subsequent CXR revealing 30% pneumothorax and new atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
New tachycardia to the 130s prompted a repeat CXR which demonstrated new opacity over entire left lung field.
She was given lopressor 5mg IV and HR decreased to low 100s; O2 sat improved to mid 90s on 2L nc with coughing.
Transferred to FICUon [**4-24**] for further mgt and bronchoscopy.
Vitals at initial evaluation: 99.9, 136/76, HR 135-->100s, 16, 97% fase mask.
Repeat CXR demonstrated renewed aeration of the lung.
She was seen by orthoopedics to clarify weightbearing status since had hip metastases with cortical involvement on CT. Orthopedics recommended weight bearing as tolerated using walker and she cleared physical therapy for discharge home with home PT.
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) ML Inhalation q4h () as needed for cough.
