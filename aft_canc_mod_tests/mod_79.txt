On eval, patient was in respiratory distress, using accessory muscles, tachypneic to the 40s, O2 sat of 90% on 6L with HR in the 140s.
ABG was 7.23/36/59/16.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

CXR [**11-9**]: In comparison with the study of [**11-8**], the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed.
CT W/O CONTRAST [**11-5**]: 1.
Multifocal pneumonia progressed since [**2103-10-24**] Chest CT, but improved when chest radiographs are reviewed between [**11-2**] and [**11-5**].
Conventional chest radiography should be sufficient to chart the course of intrathoracic findings over the near future.
For empiric coverage, posaconazole, vancomycin, meropenem, and levofloxacin were started per ID recommendations.
Bronchoscopy demonstrated mild erythema of airways but no visible obstruction.
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1065**], and viral cultures were negative.
Urine legionella negative.
Sputum, blood, and urine cultures negative.
Vigileo showed CO=9.6, CI=5.8, indicating hypervolemia with good cardiac function.
A TTE demonstrated preserved EF with new TR gradient.
He was started on furosemide 20mg IV x2 with good urine output and then on a lasix drip on [**11-7**].
A sputum gram stain showed 1+ GPC in pairs, chains, and clusters, and vancomycin was restarted.
On [**11-9**], he was extubated and satting well on only on 2L NC.
All diagnostic studies were negative except for some pleural gram stains showing GPC and a positive b-glucan (drawn before IVIG).
A repeat beta-glucan was elevated (> 500), but as this was drawn after IVIG, this was of unclear significance.
Repeat chest CT showed interval improvement.
Good urine production > 100/hour while on lasix with stable creatinine.
His creatinine continued to improve following discharge from the MICU, when his lasix was discontinued.
His creatinine on discharge was 1.6  # HISTORY OF BLEOMYCIN TOXICITY.
