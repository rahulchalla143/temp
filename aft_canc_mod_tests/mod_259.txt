Cardiology: ECG Study Date of [**2199-5-5**]  8:35:34 PM   Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2198-8-22**] ventricular rate is more rapid.
Ventricular ectopy is no longer seen.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2199-5-6**] at 11:33:01 AM Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to identify a possible left atrial appendage thrombus.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-12-11**], the rhythm is now atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and a left atrial appendage thrombus is suggested.
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2199-5-6**] at 3:34:43 PM Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.

CT ANGIOGRAM:  NECK: Minimal atherosclerotic calcification is seen at the aortic arch.
Minimal anterolisthesis of C7 on T1, is likely degenerative in etiology.
CT HEAD: Acute right MCA and PCA territory infarcts.
CT OF THE HEAD AND NECK: Occlusion of the supraclinoid right internal carotid artery and M1 branch of the right MCA.
[**2199-5-6**] Portable NCHCT: IMPRESSION: Large right middle cerebral and posterior cerebral arterial territory infarction overall unchanged in appearance compared to the most recent prior study performed five hours earlier with mass effect on the right lateral ventricle but no evidence of midline shift, hemorrhagic transformation, or herniation at this time.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2199-5-9**] 6:09 PM  IMPRESSION: Evolving right MCA/PCA territorial infarct with central hyperdensities compatible with hemorrhagic conversion, with slightly increased leftward parafalcine herniation and minimally increased right vertex sulcal effacement.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2199-5-12**] 9:32 AM IMPRESSION: Evolving right MCA/PCA territorial infarct with slight improvement of edema.
Cholelithiasis without ultrasound evidence of cholecystitis.
The remainder of the study is normal.
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2199-5-15**] 6:05 PM FINDINGS: The left atrium is mildly enlarged.
A hypoattenuating region is seen in the upper pole of the spleen measuring 38 x 75 x 89 mm consistent with the patient's known splenic infarct.
The largest lesion is seen in the lower pole of the right kidney measuring 14 x 15 mm (2, 38) with a density of 30 Hounsfield units.
Tiny gas bubble is seen within the urinary bladder, might be secondary to catheterization of the bladder.
CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2199-5-16**] 2:56 PM Comparison is made with prior study [**5-12**].
CT showed extensive right MCA and PCA infarcts (PCA infarct was felt likely embolic from fetal PCA) which were felt to be embolic from her Aflutter.
On further questioning, the patient had been mistakenly taking once daily dabigatran which is a considerable underdosing and inadequate anticoagulation.
TTE showed a possible left atrial appendage thrombus and she therefore proceeded to a TEE which showed no evidence of thrombus but complex, non-mobile atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
She had significant issues regarding AF with RVR although she was in general not hemodynamically compromised and her rate control regimen was extensively changed and cardiology were involved.
She was treated for a UTI and then started spiking fevers which were attributed to likely aspiration pneumonia/HCAP although little to find on CXR or other infectious workup, ID were [**Year (4 digits) 4221**] and eventually signed off and she completed an 8 day course of IV vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam and fevers settled.
Due to fluctuating conscious level, she had an EEG which showed no evidence of epileptiform discharges.
In the process of working up her fevers she had an U/S abdomen which showed a splenic infarct and CT abdomen/pelvis suggested a likely embolic source with evidence of a likely embolus above the origin of the celiac axis and an atherosclerotic plaque at the level of the SMA.
She was noted to have a Hb drop from 9 to 6.8 in the setting of an inadequate reticulocyte count and although stool was minimally guaiac positive, this was not enough to explain this loss and after hematology, GI and general surgery consults, this was felt to represent her MDS and required 2 units of RBCs.
Initial neurological exam revealed patient to be drowsy but arousable, oriented x2 (to self and place) with no apparent aphasia (names reasonably/follows commands) but significant dysarthria.
CN examination reveals PERRL, EOMI, a left facial droop, right gaze deviation but cannot cross midline with left homonymous hemianopia.
Limb exam revealed a dense left hemiparesis with slight withdrawal in LUE and toe extension and knee flexion on LE and good spontaneous movement on right, grimaces to noxious throughout, brisker reflexes on right and right extensor plantar.
CTA head and neck showed a hyperdense right MCA sign, acute right MCA and PCA territory infarcts, a dense right MCA consistent with thrombus and a possible small focus of hemorrhage within the right basal ganglia region with mass effect on right lateral ventricle but no MLS.
CTA showed occlusion of the supraclinoid right ICA and M1 cutoff reconstituting distally.
There was also thought to be occlusion of the distal basilar artery with the tip patent with no right PCA seen although her PCA embolism was felt to be secondary to a fetal PCA.
CT on [**5-6**] was stable.
Stroke risk factors were assessed and patient was monitored on telemetry.
Stroke risk factors were assessed with HbA1c 6.0% and FLP revealed Chol 141 TGCs 180 HDL 26 LDL 79.
TSH was 0.91.
UA was positive and UCx revealed pan sensitive E coli.
TTE on [**5-6**] showed possible left atrial appendage thrombus with mild symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild AR and a dilated ascending aorta.
CT head remained stable and patient clinically improved such that she was transferred out of the ICU to Neuro step-down on [**5-9**] but returned a few hours later after SBP decreased to 80s and she was having 20s apneic episodes.
Repeat CT scan showed central hyperdensities compatible with hemorrhagic conversion, with slightly increased leftward parafalcine herniation and minimally increased right vertex sulcal effacement and patient clinically improved.
There, she was noted to be more lethargic with fluctuating conscious level and an EEG was requested which showed slowing but no epileptiform activity.
She had continued RVR and diltiazem much improved HR but BP was borderline hypotensive and metoprolol was tapered and uptitrated diltiazem and eventually BP improved and rate was well controlled on the last 3 days of her hospitalisation.
Following her PEG insertion, she was restarted on anticoagulation with warfarin (dabigatran cannot be crushed) on [**2199-5-19**] with an overlap of aspirin until INR is therapeutic.
Her rate control and anti-hypertensive agents were initially held and during her hospitalisation, she had several episodes of RVR requiring IV rate control agents (diltiazem and metoprolol) and her diltiazem was uptitrated.
Patient was initially transferred out of ICU on [**5-9**] but due to a drop in BP to SBP 80s and 20 sec apneic episodes, was transferred back to ICU for overnight monitoring.
She received IVF 250ml boluses x2 and her BP improved although in general her SBO was mainly in 90s and 100s.
The patient was initially continued on only sotalol 80mg po bid but due to persistent pauses and further AF with RVR, cardiology were [**Month/Day (4) 4221**], sotalol was stopped and she was continued on diltiazem and metoprolol.
Following her PEG insertion, she was restarted on anticoagulation with warfarin (dabigatran cannot be crushed) with an overlap of aspirin until INR is therapeutic.
UA was positive and she was started on Ciprofloxacin on [**5-7**] for UTI (10,000 -100,000 Ecoli in urine) and was treated with a 3 day course.
To further investigate fevers, Doppler U/S of the legs revealed no evidence of DVT and ID were [**Month/Day (1) 4221**] when she again spiked a fever to 101.5F on [**5-14**] who recommended awaiting cultures and completing antibiotic course with further investigations if further fevers.
Abdominal U/S showed a large splenic infarct and to better characterise this, the patient was evaluated with CT abdomen/pelvis which showed her splenic infarct but no evidence of metastatic infection or occult infection.
She had some mild generalised abdominal pain and CT abdomen/pelvis showed her previously documented 38 x 75 x 89 mm splenic infarct, in addition to an atherosclerotic plaque at the level of the SMA and a rounded peripheral filling defect just above the origin of the celiac axis likely representing emboli and the likely cause of her splenic infarct was therefore felt to be embolic.
Her Hb drop was felt to represent her MDS given grossly inadequate reticulocyte count 0.1. .
She had a chronic anemia with HCt 27-30.
Her CBC will need to be trended at rehab and there they should consider restarting darbepoetin as per hematology.
CXRs showed atelectasis and effusions which improved after her home furosemide was restarted and she was treated with an 8 day course of IV piperacillin /tazobactam for presumed HCAP/aspiration pneumonia although there was no clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
PCP should consider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/p sleep study evaluation for this.
- Following PEG, patient was started on warfarin with goal INR [**2-8**].
- Next INR to be drawn on [**2199-5-24**].
