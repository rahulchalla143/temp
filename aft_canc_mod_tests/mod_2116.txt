This may represent underlying communicating hydrocephalus, and an MRI with CSF flow study could be performed for further evaluation, if warranted on clinical grounds.
As such, bone scan or MRI may help for further assessment.
Gadolinium enhance study can be obtained if clinically indicated following consultation with renal service.
IMPRESSION: Penetration and aspiration of thin liquids.
#Fevers: Started on broad antibiotic coverage with linezolid , bactrim and meropenem to cover osteomyelitis of right foot, stenotrophomonas pna (from prior sputum cultures as well as repeat sputum culture from this admission), and UTI (rehab center reports pus in urine).
Hematology followed pt and [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs were performed to carefuly monitor response.
On this admission, patient was initialy found to have AMS and had CT and MRI workup.
However, MRI done on [**2177-7-9**] showed no hydrocephalus.
Sputum culture grew stenotrophomonas- sparse growth, and patient was briefly treated with bactrim.
