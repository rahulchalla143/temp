Pleural fluid positive for malignant cells, AFB smear negative.
He also had CXR which was read as complete R sided opacification.
HRs have since been in the 130s - not clear if HR 70 truly accurate.
CXR performed with finding of interval increase in pleural effusion and R lung base opacificition.
A bedside ultrasound was obtained showing no pericardial effusion.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
[**2145-11-21**] Chest Xray There is essentially no change in chest findings with right upper lobe complete opacification, right pleural effusion, ground-glass opacity and mass-like consolidation in the right lower lobe, nodular opacity projecting in the left upper lobe and peribronchial abnormalities in the left lower lobe or due to patient's known non-small cell lung cancer.
UA negative, CXR without new findings, C. diff negative as above, blood cultures are no growth to date and patient ruled out for flu, parainfluenza, adenovirus and RSV.
LENIs negative as well making PE less likely.
# Leukocytosis: C. diff negative, CXR unchanged other than effusion, UA negative and blood cultures no growth to date.
