She was intubated at an OSH and came to [**Hospital1 18**] on propofol after CT revealed new Right Frontal Brain mass.
On initial exam she moved her lower extremeties spontaneously.
Her exam did not readily improve and there was concern for sub-clinical seizure.
Her EEG showed global slowing without spikes.
She had a wand study (MRI) on [**2154-5-9**] in the evening for prep for OR the am of [**2154-5-10**].
