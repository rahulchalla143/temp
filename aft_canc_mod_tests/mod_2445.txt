He was prescribed moxifloxacin for ten days after a CT chest ([**2146-8-30**]) demonstrated mosaic ground-glass attenuation with bronchiectasis throughout and in left lower lobe a tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern also notable for a lingular consolidation (pulmonary read).
He subsequently underwent bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy on the day prior to admission.
In the ED inital vitals were, 120 25 97% on NRB 156/86.
Labs were significant for Na 125, WBC 13.4, lactate 2.6.
Chest x-ray revealed large left pneumothorax without mediastinal shift.
A 28 French chest tube was placed in the ED, and repeat chest x-ray showed lung re-expansion, with the chest tube curving inferiorly.
Patient was given vancomycin, zosyn, azithromycin (BAL from [**10-19**] showing Moraxella Catarrhalis, G+ cocci in pairs and chains, and G- diplococci).

His Hgb was 4.9, WBC 14.8 (16% neutrophils, 2% bands,26% lymphocytes, and 55% monocytes).
BMBx was notable for  a population of monoblasts and promonocytes which appeared to approach 20%.
- [**2144-6-23**]: Bone marrow showed a mildly hypercellular erythroid  dominant bone marrow with no morphologic evidence of leukemia.
- [**2144-8-17**]: received single cycle Dacogen due to donor issues - [**2144-11-5**]: started reduced intensity conditioning with Fludarabine-Busulfan and ATG.

IMAGING:  CXR ([**2146-10-22**])- Slight interval improvement in aeration.
CXR ([**2146-10-20**])- AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of large left pneumothorax  CT Chest ([**8-30**]): 1.
Patient was followed by interventional pulmonology Patient self-discontinued chest tube on the evening of admission, and serial chest x-rays showed that the lung remained expanded without need for replacement of chest tube.
Patient was weaned off of oxygen successfully and repeat chest x-rays continued to show no reaccumulation of pneumothorax.
Bronchoalveolar lavage on [**10-19**] showed moraxella catarrhalis and strep pneumoniae, strep sensitive to levoquin/PCN G/tetracycline/bactrim/vancomycin.
White count and fever curve rapidly trended back to normal during hospitalization.
Surveillance blood cultures all without growth to date.
Patient followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; purpose of preceding transbronchial biopsy was to determined whether lung GVHD was present.
