Physical Exam: Exam [**2136-9-16**]:  Patient opens eyes to voice.
CLINICAL HISTORY: A 77-year-old female with bifrontal planum sphenoidale meningioma presents for evaluation with angiogram with possible embolization.
Comparison is made with CT angiogram of the head performed [**2136-7-3**] and MRI of the brain performed [**2136-7-2**].
The following blood vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were obtained in the AP and lateral projections:  1.
FINDINGS: Evaluation of the above blood vessels demonstrates no evidence of aneurysm or vascular malformation.
Large bifrontal hypervascular mass is consistent with meningioma as reported on prior cross-sectional images which is larger beings supplied by the right anterior ethmoidal and ophthalmic arteries and a left branch arising from the left callosal artery.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST  HISTORY: Large bifrontal meningioma.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.
COMPARISON STUDY: [**2136-8-30**] non-contrast head CT scan interpreted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as revealing "evolution of blood products in the left frontal lobe adjacent to the meningioma.
CONCLUSION: Relatively little change in the appearance of the postoperative CT scan, as noted above.
COMPARISONS: Chest radiograph dated [**2136-8-30**].
FINDINGS: A single AP portable upright view of the chest was obtained.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-7-24**] probably no significant change.
