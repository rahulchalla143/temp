Blood pressure was 125/53, respiratory rate 20.
Oxygenating at 80% on room air and 95% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.
The patient's cardiac examination was sinus tachycardiac with regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs appreciated.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values on admission revealed white count of 10.4 with hematocrit of 25.4, platelets 373.
The differential on white count was 87% neutrophils, 4% bands, 5% lymphocytes and 2% monocytes.
PT/PTT were 14.0 and 33.5 with an INR of 1.3.
Urinalysis was clear yellow with specific gravity of 0.013, pH of 7.0, trace blood, otherwise negative.
Sodium was 129 initially with chloride of 99, repeat sodium was 133, potassium 0.7, chloride 94, carbon dioxide 25, BUN 6, creatinine 0.7 and glucose of 119.
Chest x-ray done at the Emergency Department showed large hydropneumothorax at the left lung fields with a fluid level noted at the extreme apex.
The patient was found to have fever on hospital day #2 with a temperature maximum of 102.2.
Blood cultures were sent.
The analysis of the left pleural fluid showed a white count of 3,444 cells/ml, 90% PMNs and 7% lymphocytes.
The gram stain analysis of the pleural fluid again showed 1+ PMNs and no microorganisms seen in the cultures of those pleural fluids.
Culture of the pleural fluid eventually grew back no aerobic or anaerobic bacteria and no fungus.
On hospital day #2 the patient also received packed red blood cell transfusions for a hematocrit of 25.4 and symptoms of shortness of breath and was found to have fevers with chills with a temperature of 103.1.
The repeat test of the transfused packed red blood cells and the patient's blood sample showed no reaction against each other.
The patient was hypertensive as well with a systolic blood pressure to 170.
Stat chest x-ray showed a worsening mediastinal shift to the right, away from the left pneumonectomy site.
The patient also underwent an urgent transthoracic echocardiogram to assess the status of the right heart and that showed no obvious strains or ischemic events to the right side of the heart.
At the time the patient verbally reported feeling better and her vital signs, heartrate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturations improved.
The patient remained in the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit and again was found to be tachycardiac to 101 with blood pressures 95/62.
The patient underwent emergent thoracic angiogram to rule out any aneurysms of the thoracic aorta which was found to be negative.
The patient was started on Neo-Synephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 and Cardiology Service was consulted.
Review of the transthoracic echocardiogram showed a global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction estimated at 25 to 30% with unknown etiology.
The patient was eventually started on Milrinone at a low dose in addition to a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 90.
The patient was gradually weaned off of Milrinone and Neo-Synephrine drips and by hospital day #6 the patient was maintained on a blood pressure of 114/56 without any Milrinone or Neo-Synephrine.
Because of her tachycardia, the patient was started on low dose Lopressor and Captopril for her hypertension.
