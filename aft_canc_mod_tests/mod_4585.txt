IMAGING / STUDIES: # CHEST (PA & LAT) ([**2176-6-10**] at 10:23 AM): IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lobulation and enlargement of the left hilus is best explained by adenopathy, conceivably with some calcification but malignant until proved otherwise.
# ECG ([**2176-6-10**] at 1:51:26 PM): Sinus rhythm with a right axis deviation.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 93 142 88 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 83707**] 85 .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
# CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ([**2176-6-11**] at 12:01 AM): FINDINGS: An irregularly marginated mass is present in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, crossing the fissure into the adjacent posterior portion of the left upper lobe.
The aorticopulmonary window and left hilar nodes result in narrowing of the left main and upper lobe bronchi which have an irregular configuration.
Examination of the upper abdomen is limited as the study was not tailored to evaluate this region.
Limited assessment of soft-tissue structures due to absence of intravenous contrast.
Echo shows minimal residual effusion.
Successful pericardiocentesis 2.
# Portable TTE (Focused views) ([**2176-6-13**] at 4:00:00 PM): This study was compared to the prior study of [**2176-6-11**].
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-6-11**], the previously seen small to moderate pericardial effusion with echocardiographic evidence of tamponade has markedly decreased in size and is now trivial without the presence of tamponade physiology.
Given the limited nature of the current study, comparison with other aspects of the previous, comprehensive echocardiogram was not performed.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-6-13**], the pericardial effusion has slightly increased.
# ECG ([**2176-6-16**] at 11:45:44 AM): Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-6-10**] no diagnostic interim change.

# MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ([**2176-6-16**] at 6:59 PM): FINDINGS: There is no infarction, hemorrhage, mass or mass effect.
# ECG ([**2176-6-17**] at 7:46:58 AM): Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-6-16**] no diagnostic interim change.
TRACING #2 Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 99 134 90 328/396 82 95 81 .
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2176-6-17**] at 11:58 AM): FINDINGS: The lungs are hyperexpanded without focal consolidation.
# CT ABD & PELVIS ([**2176-6-17**] at 4:52 PM): CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
The liver, spleen, gallbladder, and pancreas are normal in appearance.
CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS: The bladder, prostate, and rectum are unremarkable.
His cough was nonproductive and an induced sputum could not be obtained.
CT chest was performed shortly after admission and was highly concerning for either a primary or metastatic lung malignancy.
Bronchoscopy was deferred until results from his pericardiocentesis were available, since the results could have been be sufficient to establish a diagnosis without bronchoscopy if positive for malignancy.
Initial pericardial fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells, however, and bronchoscopy was performed on [**2176-6-17**] once the patient returned to the general medical floor.
# Pericardial Mass / Effusion: In addition to the lung lesions, a pericardial mass and effusion were seen on CT chest.
Post-pericardiocentesis TTE showed minimal residual effusion.
The drain stopped putting out at 9am on [**2176-6-14**], and repeat TTE showed a very small pericardial effusion.
# Transitional Care: -- Multiple lymph node biopsy results pending at time of discharge -- Follow up in Thoracic [**Hospital **] Clinic to be arranged .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for cough, chest discomfort, and shortness of breath.
A chest X-ray prior to admission showed a mass concerning for lung cancer.
You had a chest CT which showed several lung nodules and enlarged lymph nodes which were also concerning for lung cancer.
The CT scan also showed fluid around the heart called a pericardial effusion.
You had an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to evaluate this fluid.
You had a bronchoscopic lung biopsy in order to obtain a sample of the abnormal lymph nodes and make a definite diagnosis.
The results from these biopsies are still pending.
Several other studies including a brain MRI and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis were performed.
