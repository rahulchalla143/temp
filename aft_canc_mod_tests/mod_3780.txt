[**2194-5-7**]: CVL placement [**2194-5-20**]: G-J tube replacement   History of Present Illness: This very nice 49-year-old gentleman was referred for a duodenal carcinoid that was recently picked up on an upper endoscopy.
An ERCP was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] recently and this revealed a normal biliary duct without obstruction.
In addition to the preop workup, a CAT scan showed extensive lymphadenopathy throughout the upper abdomen.
An endoscopic ultrasound was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 1 week prior to this operation and did not reveal any diagnostic information.
Therefore a lymph node biopsy as well as a liver biopsy would be required for this operation.
On [**2194-5-1**] he elective presented for a transduodenal resection of a carcinoid tumor, an open cholecystectomy, a liver biopsy as well as a lymph node biopsy.
His HEENT exam shows him to have no scleral icterus, no lymphadenopathy and moist membranes.
His cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.
Pulmonary exam is within normal limits and clear to auscultation.
Musculoskeletal exam shows that he has good motor and sensory function throughout all domains tested.
His skin exam is normal, and there is no evidence of any gross lymphadenopathy.

Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate a percutaneous gastrostomy tube with its tip in a post-pyloric location.
This most likely represents a parathyroid nodule and correlation with a sestamibi scan is recommended.
Correlation with a sestamibi scan is recommended.
On POD 1 he was transferred to the floor.
His home blood pressure medications were selectively restarted with holding parameters which meant he frequently did not receive the doses.
He was mentating at his baseline and his systolic blood pressure was 70-80.
An O2 sat could not be obtained using a finger, toe, or forehead probe.
ABGs were sent which showed an pO2 of 44 on 10L O2.
Repeat values were 52.
A CXR showed question of a LLL infiltrate.
That evening he became febrile, pan cultures were sent, and broad spectrum antibiotics were started for presumptive pneumonia.
Sputum culture eventually grew Moraxella Catarrhalis and Haemophilus Influenzae.
He also had an ultrasound of his RUE to rule out a DVT.
A swallow evaluation on [**2194-5-14**] showed the patient is positive for signs and symptoms of aspiration.
A re-evaluation on [**2194-5-19**] showed he aspirates all consistences after the swallow as evidenced by coughing.
He underwent an ultrasound of his parathyroid gland to evaluate for potential nodules in light of his persistent hypercalcemia.
He should have an outpatient nuclear medicine sestimibe scan of his parathyroid gland and follow up with his renal dialysis doctors.
You will need a parathyroid scan as an outpatient for further evaluation.
Please notify them that you need to have an outpatient nuclear medicine sestimibi scan of your parathyroid gland for evaluation of hypercalcemia.
