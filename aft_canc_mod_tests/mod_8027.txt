She has been hypercarbic over the last few days (50s-60s since extubation) with minimal urine output (15-20 cc/hr), which was treated with fluid bolus.
Her O2 sats have been ok during this time.
Shortly following the valvuloplasty, pt developed GI bleed and had a EGD/colonoscopy, which revealed the large cecal mass.

TEE ([**2195-12-8**]):Initial exam: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Chest X-Ray ([**2195-12-13**]):FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**12-12**], there is again substantial cardiomegaly with some [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.
Urine output trended down.
Creatinine continued to rise.
hypervolemia: patient has known dCHF and systolic dysfuction with EF 45-50%.
CXR shows consistent pulmonary edema.
AS: recently underwent valvuloplasty, still with valve area of 0.8cm2.
#) Acute Diastolic Heart Failure: most recent echo from [**11-3**] showed diastolic dysfunction with an overall preserved EF.
Based on clinical exam with findings of crackles in her lungs, LE edema and CXR with volume overload, she likely received too much fluid in the setting of post-op low urine output.
Her blood pressure tolerated the diuresis well.
When getting lasix her blood pressures should be monitored every 4 hours during the day, with a goal of getting about 1L of fluid off per day.
She should NOT be given lasix if her systolic blood pressure is under 100 as she has severe aortic stenosis.
If given IV lasix she should have her electrolytes checked to make sure potassium is above 4 and her magnesium is above 2. urrently she has crackles in her lungs left>right and some wheeze for which she is receiving ipratropium nebs.
She was continued on her home metoprolol for rate control, however her rate control was suboptimal so she was also loaded with digoxin and started on .0625mg daily, for better rate control with less blood pressure effects.
SHE IS CURRENTLY ON 0-1/2L OF OXYGEN AND THIS SHOULD BE TITRATED DOWN AS QUICKLY AS POOSSIBLE TO KEEP HER O2 SATS BETWEEN 90-94% to help prevent her from retaining more CO2 .
Pathology showed low grade adenocarcinoma, per surgery T2N0, so no further treatment needed at this time.
#) Acute Renal Failure: patient with baseline Cr of 0.8 to 1.0, creatinine elevated in the setting of hypervolemia.
Her creatinine continued to improve and was back to her baseline with further diuresis, making the cause of her renal failure likely poor forward flow from volume overload.
#) Hypertension: blood pressure remained well controlled on home metoprolol .

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
You should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] on Tuesday [**1-13**] at 10:40.
