Head CT [**9-5**]: Neg .
Chest CT [**9-13**]:  Mild cardiomegally, trace bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral dependent lower lobe consolidation or atelectasis, diffuse ground glass appearance c/w interstitial pneumonitis or ARDS.
ECHO [**9-13**]: EF 60%, mild LVH, mild MR .
CXR [**9-20**]: Rotated to the right, bibasilar consolidation vs fluid overload.
Repaet CT scan may be of value.
[**2145-9-21**] CT head IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2145-9-21**] CT abdomen IMPRESSION: 1.
As the tube was not visualized on ultrasound this is concerning for tube malpositioning.
Further evaluation with tube cholangiogram under fluoroscopy is recommended.
[**2145-9-23**] MRI head IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2145-9-24**] EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG study due to slowing and disorganization of the background activity.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are the most common causes.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Had a perc chole drain placed at OSH, which was pulled in house after a CT scan showed that it may have been out of place.
