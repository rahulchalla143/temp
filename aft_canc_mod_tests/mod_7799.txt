If there is continued concern for parenchymal changes and acute infarcs, MRI is more sensitive and can be considered if not contra-indicated.
TTE ([**2160-10-9**]) Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
A bone marrow biopsy was obtained, the final results of which remain pending.
A head CT was performed that showed a large area of hypodensity in the right cerebellar hemisphere adjacent to the remote craniotomy (acoustic neuroma).
A MRI of the head was planned to better evaluate the posterior fossa, however it was determined that the patient was too unstable to leave the floor after an episode of tachycardia and tachypneic followed by bradycardia.
A renal ultrasound did not reveal hydronephrosis.
A bronchoscopy was done which revealed bloody fluid in the left lower lobe.
