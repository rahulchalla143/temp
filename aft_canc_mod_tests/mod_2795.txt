Laboratories were notable for normal white count, hematocrit 33.2 (baseline ~32), platelets 211, normal chem10 with exception of slightly elevated phos (4.7), normal transaminases, LDH 327 (200s-400s in [**June 2129**] admission), normal coags other than PTT (16.6), and lactate of 1.2.
Blood cultures were sent.
CT head was performed, which showed a hypodense area in suprasellar region which might c/w bleed.
Vitals were 99 66-91 83-110/61-81 [**9-9**] 100% (oxygen delivery unknown)  Headache managed with Dilaudid IV.
Neuro checks were performed every 2 hours, which were normal.
MRI was performed, which suggested lymphoma rather than bleed, as well as new sinus involvement concerning for lymphoma.
Past Medical History: Oncologic history: --Initially diagnosed in [**2127-3-22**] after presenting with severe abdominal pain and a CT scan revealed a large intra-abdominal mass.
Biopsy revealed a high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
Follow up scans showed complete remission.
Blood work at that time concerning for recurrence of her lymphoma (LDH 641).
Biopsy of the mass confirmed recurrence of her previous diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma.
Her postpartum course was complicated by fevers, pelvic fluid collection, and an upper GI bleed due to gastric involvement of her lymphoma which initially delayed her chemotherapy.
A neck CT demonstrated clot and extensive phlegmon in the carotid, retropharyngeal, and paravertebral spaces.
CT of her neck showed significantly increased lymphadenopathy along the bilateral jugular chains and left supraclavicular region.
Lymph node biopsy on [**2128-12-15**] was consistent with relapsed lymphoma.
Repeat imaging by PET scan on [**2129-4-22**] showed residual but improved FDG-avid cervical lymphadenopathy with no other adenopathy or FDG-avid disease.
CT scan showed no intra-abdominal lesions concerning for lymphoma involvement.
--[**2129-6-15**], repeat head MRI showed diffuse FLAIR signal hyperintensity in the bilateral medial frontal lobes, caudate head, and subependymal regions of the lateral ventricles, which had decreased in overall intensity in extent compared to the prior exam, especially in the inferomedial frontal lobes.
--[**2129-7-6**], evidence of persistent disease on CSF; LP showed 30-40 WBCs per hpf, suggestive of lymphoma involvment, confirmed with immunophenotyping --[**2129-7-7**], 4th cycle of high dose MTX @ 8000 mg/m2, complicated by increased transaminases, improved over time.
New, 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm enhancing suprasellar mass.
Further evaluation via direct examination is recommended.
CT HEAD [**2129-7-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI with contrast is recommended for further evaluation.
[**8-3**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT [**2129-8-9**]: 1.
Sellar and nasopharyngeal masses likely representing lymphomatous involvement are better-delineated on MRI of [**2129-7-25**].
As suggested in the report of the MR study dated [**2129-5-11**], this may represent progressive communicating hydrocephalus related to lymphomatous involvement of the subarachnoid space, which should be correlated with clinical data.

At that time CTA and CT were recommended; she was unable to get a CTA due to problems with access and receiving contrast, but did get a CT which showed no new process.
A 24 hour EEG was attempted, however the patient removed most of her leads and this was a limited study.
SHe was subtherapeutic on her phenytoin based on her most recent level on [**8-2**].
She did receive whole brain irradiation on [**8-1**], she was restarted on her enoxaparin [**8-1**], but her CT head did not show any acute process including bleeds or edema.
Her electrolytes are within normal limits.
Pt was not CO2 retaining and had normal ABG this morning.
Other potential causes were considered, including worsening of CNS process; CT scan performed showed no new findings.
Blood pressures remained stable while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and then on the floor.
Lovenox was restarted on [**2129-8-1**] after results of head CT on [**7-31**] showed no apparent bleed.
# Pancytopenia/Anemia: Patient with baseline hematocrit of ~32, with hx of G6PD deficiency.
Remained afebrile without localizing symptoms, and UA/urine culture and blood culture remained negative.
