Non-small cell lung CA diagnosed [**10/2183**] from bronchoscopic biopsy of left-upper lobe mass at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with PET CT showing uptake in mediastinal lymph nodes and left adrenal, S/P rigid bronchoscopy and laser treatment and stenting in [**11/2183**] at [**Hospital1 18**], cisplatin and XRT from [**Month (only) 404**]-[**Month (only) 956**] [**2183**], XRT to 4th left rib in [**2184-2-28**], pemetrexed therapy in [**2184-3-30**], Taxotere therapy in [**2184-4-29**], CT in [**2184-5-30**] with disease progression, enrolled in clinical trial for seliciclib in [**2184-6-29**] #.
Partial thyroidectomy in [**2164**] for further evaluation of a nodule.
She underwent bronchoscopy on [**2183-11-19**] with pathology consistent with nonsmall cell lung cancer, most likely adenocarcinoma.
A PET-CT on [**2183-11-29**], reportedly showed uptake in the left lung, mediastinal lymph nodes, and left adrenal gland.
Head MRI was negative.
She had a bronchoscopy on [**2183-12-19**] at which time a stent was placed in the left mainstem  bronchus.
She underwent repeat bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound on [**2184-1-1**].
A level 7 and a level 4 node were biopsied by FNA.
NECK: No JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds on left, crackles at right base.

STUDIES: [**2184-8-2**] - CT TORSO FINDINGS: .
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Hyponehancement of left lingula and left lower lobe conistent with Pnuemonia is noted.
The large necrotic tumor in the left lower lung has increased in size since the last examination .
There aorticopulmonary node seen in the previous examination appears stable.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: New hypodense lesions are noted in the liver, most likely metastases.
Bilateral adrenal masses seen on the previous examination have increased in size.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Heterogeneously enhancing foci in the right iliacus, right gluteus, and the left quadriceps are persistent and have increased in size.
[**2184-8-3**] - PLEURAL FLUID: Gram stain negative, no growth on culture.
[**2184-8-5**] - CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2184-8-5**] - CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
Progressive pneumonic consolidation (including endobronchial spread of infection) and alveolar hemorrhage are additional concerns.
TRANSFUSION REACTION WORKUP DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname 76514**] experienced a 3 degree F temperature increase, chills, a significant drop in her O2 saturation from 90-94% to 81%, and wheezing following transfusion of 40 cc's of ABO/Rh compatible leukoreduced, irradiated RBC's.
Her O2 saturation improved to 97% when switched from 6L nasal cannula to non-rebreather mask.
Post-transfusion CXR showed possible non-cardiogenic edema in right lung (left lung collapse  unchanged).
The presence of fever, minimal response to diuresis, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema on CXR are suspicious for TRALI.
Blood samples will be sent to the Red Cross for work-up of this possible TRALI reaction and reported in an addendum.
The post-transfusion NTProBNP did rise in this patient, however the increase is difficult to interpret in this setting.
Additional American Red Cross test results will be reported in an addendum.
After admission, a CT scan was preformed which showed worsening left sided pleural effusion.
The pleural fluid and blood cultures remain negative.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and her oxygen requirement was weaned down to 4-5L at transfer.
She complained of chest pressure and an subsequent ECG was noted to show ST elevations in V1 and V2.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
The patient's hematocrit continued to decrease during her stay with a nadir of 20.7.
They decided that a outpatient hospice program would be the best way to proceed at this time.
