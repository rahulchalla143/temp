CARDIAC CATH REPORTS: [**2191-8-4**] 1.
Findings compare with cardiac cath performed in in [**2188**].
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of 131 mmHg.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2191-8-12**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2191-8-12**]: 1.
man with a h/o known CAD, HLD, and bladder cancer who presented with chest pain and was found to have an anterior STEMI with cardiac catheterization showed complete occlusion of the proximal LAD.
EKG at [**Hospital1 **] showed an anterior STEMI and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a complete occlusion of the proximal LAD.
Cardiac enzymes trended down to 2100, peaking at 3853.
ECHO HD # 1 showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- and distal anterior, septal segments and apex.
# R femoral bruit: Of note, the patient had a right femoral bruit at the site of his catheterization from [**2191-8-4**].
Arterial doppler did not show any evidence of an AVM, fistula or aneurysm.
#Anemia: Patient reported a fall the day of his cardiac event in which he fell into [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
On physical exam on HD1, patient had ecchymosis on bilateral posterior hips without complaints of tenderness.
His hematocrit dropped from 42.0 prior to admission to 28.3 and then 25.9.
He was transfused 1U PRBC and his hematocrit responded to 29.
CT abdomen showed no retroperitoneal bleed or hematoma.
His Hct remained stable and on discharge was 30.7.
