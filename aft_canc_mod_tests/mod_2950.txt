Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia to 115 beats per minute with diffuse ST depressions that improved with rate control and nitrates.
He ruled in for an myocardial infarction at [**Hospital3 **] with a peak CK of 609 and a troponin greater then 50.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] where a cardiac catheterization was done, which showed three vessel disease.
Arterial blood gas performed at that time was 7.47, 41, 81.
T tube, Port-A-Cath removed two weeks prior to admission.
The patient's daughter believes he has a lung nodule of unclear etiology on CT scan at outside hospital.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature 98.4.
Pulse 90.
Blood pressure 90s to 150s/60s.
Respiratory rate in the 30s.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 14.3, hematocrit 36.6, platelets 271, PT/PTT 13.2/25.8, INR 1.2.
Neutrophils 81, bands 0, lymphocytes 11.
Sodium 134, potassium 2.9, chloride 93, CO2 28, BUN 12, creatinine .6, glucose 112, ALT 23, AST 96, serial CKs 608, 467, 409.
Alkaline phosphatase 74, T bili 0.9, serial troponins greater then 50, 8.1, calcium 9.4, phos 3.2, magnesium 1.9, hematocrit 36.7.
Chest x-ray diffuse alveolar and reticular infiltrates bilaterally, greater at the bases.
Sputum was sent for culture.
Chest x-ray suggested a possible interstitial process.
The patient had a CT scan, which revealed no pulmonary embolus, chronic interstitial process at the extreme bases with diffuse ground glass opacities worrisome for an underlying infectious or inflammatory process and multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with the patient's metastasis or perhaps primary lung tumor.
The patient received an echocardiogram, which revealed a global hypokinesis and a depressed ejection fraction about 40%.
The patient on the morning of [**2169-5-30**] was noted to have fixed dilated pupils and lack of oculocephalic reflex on physical examination.
Postmortem examination requested and permission obtained.
