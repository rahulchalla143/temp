Bile duct brushings taken are positive for malignant cells consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.CT performed on [**11-14**] showed cholangiocarcinoma at the common hepatic duct-cystic duct confluence and on [**2146-11-16**] patient underwent Exploratory laparotomy, common bile duct excision.
Roux study on [**11-21**] showed patent anastomosis with free passage of contrast into the jejunum and mild dilation of the intrahepatic biliary system.
Blood pressures remained low during hospitalization, requiring adjustments to, and short term holding of beta blockers.
Neuro consult immediate for stroke protocol, head CT obtained with no evidence of bleed.
Head MRI obtained subsequently showed No evidence of acute infarction, but there is evidence of old infarct involving the left occipital lobe.
Cardiac Echo on [**11-24**] showed no cardiac source of embolus identified.
This was for the ongoing potential for fluid management, however, the drain output will be managed by limiting output to 300 cc, emptying only 3 times daily, and allowing reabsorption of any excess.
Patient almost to anticoagulation goal of [**3-11**] INR by discharge on [**2146-11-30**].
Will continue on 7.5 mg Coumadin daily, have INR checked and results faxed to [**Hospital 1326**] clinic who will, for now manage Coumadin therapy.
