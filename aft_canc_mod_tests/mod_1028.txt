The pain started in his chest and then spread to his abdomen and back.
He had a noncontrast CT abdomen which did not reveal a cause of his pain.
Initial ECG demonstrated AF with RVR.
After 5 hours on a diltiazem gtt he developed relative hypotension with SBP in 80s and the drip was stopped.
BP at transfer 89/41.
Barium swallow [**5-21**] demonstrated esophageal lesion--8 cm infiltrating carcionma of distal esophagus.
PET [**7-22**] showed multi-focal FDG avid left pleural nodular thickening and right medial upper pleural nodular thickening worrisome for metastatic disease.

Studies: 1. pCXR: No change from the prior study of [**2138-7-31**], with pleural and parenchymal opacity in the left base.
ECG: AF with RVR rate 167 bpm-->NSR with normal axis, normal intervals, TWI I, aVL, II, aVF, V5, V6, <1 mm STD V4-V6-->NSR, NA/NI, TWF I, aVL, no ST changes.
Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal (LVEF 50-60%); however, the inferolateral (posterior) wall appears hypokinetic.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Blood cultures were drawn and found to be negative.
Urine culture demonstrated <10,000 organisms/ml, which was considered possibly [**1-17**] contamination.
Fecal cultures were negative and he was CDiff negative.
CXR demonstrated no infiltrate.
No infectious etiology to abdominal pain seen on CT scan.
Pt ruled out for MI after cardiac enzymes were drawn given ST/T wave changes on ECG.
ECHO on [**9-5**] demonstrated inferolateral wall hypokinesis but normal EF.
TSH was normal at 0.91. .
ARF: Cr 1.9=>1.1 from baseline 1.0.
He had both a negative barium swallow as well as a negative bone scan while in the hospital.
