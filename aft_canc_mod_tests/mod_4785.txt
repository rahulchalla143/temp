Significanly better-demonstrated on the MR study is contiguous involvement of the left dorsolateral epidural space at the C6 level, with displacement and some compression of the spinal cord.
However, there is no convincing signal or enhancement abnormality on the MR study to specifically confirm similar marrow replacement, and this may simply represent asymmetric fat.
CXR [**2178-3-25**]: There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
Given the clinical presentation of the patient CT of the thorax should be considered.
MRI C/T/L spine [**2178-3-25**]: Multifocal bone destruction, presumably representing metastatic disease, as on the prompting very recent studies, most significantly including: 1.
Postoperative HCT was low and he was transfused multipe units of PRBCs and platelets.
