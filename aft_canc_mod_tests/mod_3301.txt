He has been doing relatively well at home since his most recent two hospital admissions: [**Date range (1) 73068**] admitted with progressive weakness due to pneumonia and UTI and [**Date range (1) 73067**] with fever and found to have a pansensitive E. coli bacteremia, Vancomycin sensitive enterococcal bacteremia, and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] blood stream infection.
Last had chemotherapy with Cycle 1 Decitabine on [**2135-6-6**] after a drug challenge with lower doses which he tolerated well.
The drug challenge was performed because he had a severe reaction to Azacitadine with multiple skin complications including neutrophilic dermatoses and ischemic bowel.
BP was symmetric in BUE at that time.
A bedside echo was performed by the cardiology fellow with new inferolateral hypokinesis so he was transferred urgently for cath, lab was activated overnight.
Cath revealed single vessel right dominant disease with 70% stenosis of the RCA.
His CP was attributed to demand ischemia and troponin peaked at 0.07 before trending down.
UA showed trace leuks, few bacteria and CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Blood and urine cultures show NGTD.
Past Medical History: MDS RAEB type 1, 7% blasts with extensive myelofibrosis, 7q-, transfusion dependent, s/p azacitadine complicated by ischemic bowel perforation and multiple ulcers (pyoderma gangrenosum).
Demand ischemia with 70% stenosis of RCA on cath [**9-5**], elected to treat with medical therapy alone   Social History: Retired, used to work for a chemical company.

Overall left ventricular systolic function appears grossly preserved (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Lung volumes have minimally increased, potentially suggesting improved ventilation.

BLOOD Cultures all negative  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of MDS evolving to AML with increasing transfusion requirement and severe pancytopenia.
Pt had a drop in HCT, which along with his abdominal pain was concerning for an intraabdominal bleed--CT did not demonstrate hemmorrhage.
Blood cultures were negative, but sputum culture came back positive for pan-resistant (except Amikacin) pseudomonal pneumonia.
Blood cultures were negative.
EKG showed ST depressions in V4-V5 that resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine.
An echo was performed with showed new infererolateral hypokinesis.
The pt was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization where a 70% osteal right coronary artery disease was discovered.
He was observed in the CCU for approximately 24 hrs where his blood pressures remained stable and he remained chest pain free.
He was then transfered back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
