EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.6, heart rate 120-90, blood pressure 132/54, respiratory rate 18, sats 95percent on room air.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABS:  White count 0.1, hematocrit 27.6, platelets 88.
Chemistries - sodium 132, potassium 3.6, chloride 101, bicarb 16, BUN 41, creatinine 1.7, glucose 131, lactate 1.7.
UA was negative for infection.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
Chest x-ray showed COPD with no pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
CT of the abdomen was done and showed thickening and stranding of the distal ileum with some fluid in the abdomen.
On [**2124-3-10**], she underwent an exploratory laparotomy.
This was later weaned and    changed to prn morphine as needed, and prior to discharge    her pain was well-controlled on Roxicet prn, and very    small amounts of Ativan prn.
A CT was    done and showed recent infarctions in the middle cerebral    arterial territory and left occipital territory.
Further    work-up for what seemed to be embolic strokes included an    echo which did not show any source of emboli.
Her    creatinine was slightly elevated to peak of 1.4, but had    returned to [**Location 213**] prior to discharge.
Her last weight on [**4-5**] was 70 kg.
Blood counts, thereafter, improved.
Her last    white count was 15.2 on [**4-5**].
Her hematocrits have    remained stable around 29/30 over the last few days.
Her OA positive culture was 1 out of 2    bottles of blood culture from the 22, the day of her    admission, which grew presumptive Clostridium septicum.
Once afebrile and her white counts were normal, this    regimen was stopped.
Her catheter, as well as 1 out of 4    bottles of blood grew Staph coag-negative, and her sputum    on that day grew Pseudomonas and MRSA.
She    has remained afebrile, hemodynamically stable, with a mild    and stable elevation of her white count over the last few    days.
Work-up for that included an ultrasound    which was negative for DVT.
Exploratory laparotomy, status post small bowel resection    and ileostomy.
