His temperature at home this morning was 98.3. .
He was brought to OSH for the new abdominal pain and ongoing confusion, where he had a temperature of 100.3, and labs notable for WBC 18.4 with 83% PMN and 3% bands, a lactate of 2.0, and BNP 6421.
CXR was read as possible RML infiltrate and pt received vancomycin, levofloxacin, and azithromycin at OSH ED.
Pt had a negative head CT and an abdominal CT showing L periaortic retroperitoneal fat stranding with a small amount of extraluminal fluid.
He was found to have a troponin of 0.05 and was med flighted here due to concern for NSTEMI.
Labs were significant for WBC 15.3, 92.4% PMN, Trop 0.03, lactate of 2.7, and INR 2.1.
On arrival to the MICU, pt had T 98.2 HR 125, BP 128/82, RR 28, and sat 100% on 2L.

[**2-6**] CXR IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
[**2-7**] CT L-SPINE WITH CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
Compression fracture of the L2 vertebral body with involvement of the inferior endplate and bilateral pedicle fractures; concerning for instability.
[**2-12**] CT HEAD IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Direct impact to his mid-back on door frame, which corresponds to CT spine findings of fractured L1 and L2 vertebrae and corresponding spinal point tenderness on exam.
Coordinated re-review of final CT spine read by neuroradiology determined that all imaging findings could be explained by traumatic fracture + hematoma, not osteomyelitis (vertebral endplates not involved).
Patient will be seen in outpatient [**Hospital **] clinic with follow-up CT L-spine re-imaging to evaluate interval change in retroperitoneal hematoma.
TTE was negative for endocarditis.
No cultures were ever positive here; OSH cultures also negative (finalized [**2-13**]); however, unable to determine from OSH records whether these cultures were drawn before or after antibiotics were started at the OSH.
No evidence of spinal cord infarct or compression seen on CT scan.
Neurology consult service evaluated him, reviewed records (including extensive outpatient neurology workup ~10 years ago including EEG monitoring and medication trials) confirmed prior diagnosis of pseudoseizure plus periodic limb movements of sleep, not actual seizure.
Anticoagulated on a heparin gtt when INR drifted <2, is discharged on lovenox bridge while awaiting coumadin therapeutic >2 x48h (because of stroke history).
# SYSTOLIC CHF, LVEF 55% Family does not report heart failure diagnosis but pt has cardiomegaly on CXR, mitral stenosis, afib, pacemaker, & takes daily lasix.
TTE shows mod-to-severe valvular heart disease but preserved LVEF ~55%.
After transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], his troponin leak was thought most likely demand ischemia in the setting of infection-related tachycardia.
Pain control - monitor and adjust pain meds PRN.
Monitor psedoseizure activity, frequency (arrange follow-up neurology evaluation with [**Hospital1 18**] Neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if this worsens or interferes w/care) 5.
Metoprolol dose increased in setting of infection, will need HR monitoring and dose decrease as infection resolves.
Lovenox 100 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 0.9 ML Subcutaneous once a day: CONTINUE UNTIL INR >2 FOR 48 HOURS, THEN STOP.
On CT scan we could see that you suffered fractures of your L1 and L2 vertebrae (low spine) when you fell at home.
