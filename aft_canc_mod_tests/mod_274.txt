URINE CULTURE (Final [**2114-5-20**]):    NO GROWTH .
Imaging: Most recent CXR: PA and lateral chest radiographs show bilateral low lung volumes.
[**2114-5-29**] CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a 6.3 x 5.4-cm well-defined fluid collection posterior to the bladder appears relatively unchanged compared to the prior study.
Ileocolonic anastamosis: 1.
Labs revealed leukopenia (2.9K, decreased from 10k the day prior) with 34% bands.
CXR was notable for pneumonperitoneum.
A bowel leak was discovered, thought to be secondary to a thermal injury, with gross stool in the peritoneal cavity.
Estimated blood loss was 1.5 L. He was extubated without event.
His urine output was reportedly good.
Hematocrits were 42.4 preop on [**5-16**].7 immediately preop, and 32.4 on recheck.
CXR demonstrates atelectasis.
Anemia: HCT 22 to 28.6 this am following 2 Units pRBC .
His leukocytosis peaked at 21 on [**5-27**] but has since decreased to 13.9. .
A CT abd/pelvis on [**5-25**] revealed right upper quadrant fluid collection with multiple smaller additional right retroperitoneal fluid pockets which may be in continuity with the largest right upper quadrant collection as well as a large midline pelvic fluid collection.
On [**5-30**], repeat CT showed that the subhepatic fluid collection extends in the paracolic gutters and has slightly decreased in size compared to the prior study now measuring maximally 4.7 x 2.4 cm.
The patient's HCT trended down from 25-23 resulting in transfusion on packed red blood cells with a good effect, HCT increased to 28.
