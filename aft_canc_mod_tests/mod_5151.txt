Retrieval of the capsule was not possible due to the angulation of the scope and the resultant difficulty in passing instruments down the scope channel.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the mid/distal jejunum at the site of the mass.
Retrieval of the capsule was not possible due to the angulation of the scope and the resultant difficulty in passing instruments down the scope channel.
Brief Hospital Course: 81yo M w/ PMHx of CHF (EF <35% on [**5-17**] ECHO), recent DVT in left arm [**1-8**] PICC on heparin SQ and Fe-deficiency anemia w/ recent GI bleed last month who presents to the ED after capsule endoscopy showed active bleeding in small bowel for further management.
Of note, patient recently had a CT abdomen/pelvis that showed a segment of abnormal bowel wall thickening involving the midline small bowel, which has a dilated appearance and is adjacent to several prominent mesenteric lymph nodes.
He was taken for small bowel endoscopy but the study was unrevealing, perhaps not reaching the area noted on the CT to be abnormal.
Final pathology report of the biopsy is pending, however preliminary report is suggestive of malignancy, most likely lymphoma.
His hematocrit was 28 at the time of discharge and had been stable for 24 hours.
He should have his hematocrit checked at least twice weekly and should receive blood transfusions to maintain a goal hematocrit of 28 (unless he opts for hospice).
The plan is for him to follow-up with oncology once final pathology is back.
s/p biventricular pacer with EKG showing ventricular pacing.
Patient appeared euvolemic on exam without LE edema, crackles, or elevated JVD.
Lisinopril and torsemide were held as he appeared euvolemic and his blood pressure was normal in the 100's-110's systolic.
On presentation to the ED, coag studies show PTT 33.4.
You underwent an endoscopy and had a mass that was biopsied.
The biopsy showed a cancer, likely a lymphoma.
