A chest x-ray on [**2119-3-14**] showed two large pulmonary masses in the right upper lobe (6.7 x 5.9 and 3.9 x 2.6 cm) as well as several additional nodular opacities in both lower lobes.
A subsequent CT showed stage IV lung cancer with right upper lobe primary, satellite nodules, bibasilar metastases, and bilateral effusions right greater than left.
On arrival to the ED his initial VS were 97.8 140/52 60 24 sat 92% on room air.
A chest x-ray showed worsening pleural effusions.
He was sent for a CTA to rule out a PE.
An EKG showed atrial flutter with 4:1 conduction but no ischemic changes.
Vital signs at the time of transfer were hr 57 bp 135/55 80% on FM, 99%/BiPAP.
On arrival to the MICU the patient appeared to be in no acute distress and was breathing comfortably with sats of 93% on 5L NC.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-11-3**] findings are similar  [**2119-3-20**] CHEST (PA & LAT): Known right upper lobe lung mass, and multiple bibasilar pulmonary nodules, redemonstrated.
[**2119-3-20**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY: Metastatic lung cancer, with a right upper lobe primary mass and multiple satellite metastatic nodules in both lungs, not significantly changed since the earlier study of [**2119-3-14**].
[**2119-3-20**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: No acute intracranial pathology.
Please note that a non-enhanced MRI study would be more sensitive for metastatic disease.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-11-17**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Based on [**2112**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year.
Lung volumes are otherwise low.
There is a right-sided pleural effusion as well as a more focal area which correlates to the multiple masses on the chest CT from one day prior.
Pleural fluid was negative for malignant cells.
Repeat echo (last [**2113**]) showed LVEF 55% and was largely unchanged other than that the severity of mitral regurgitation increased.
He was transferred to the floor, and underwent IP guided thoracentesis of 900cc fluid with placement of pleural catheter to gravity drainage.
Fluid studies as above and indicate transudate (still possible with malignant effusions)  He will receive continued diuresis with oral lasix and transition to IV lasix if he has continued hypoxia.
# Adencocarcinoma of the Lung: Pleural fluid was negative for malignant cells, but CT was suggestive of metastatic disease.
He underwent bronchoscopic lung biopsy on [**3-23**] with lymph node bx confirming adenoCA.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: - lung cancer, adenocarcinoma - pleural effusion - acute on chronic diastolic CHF - diabetes type 2 controlled, uncomplicated - acute kidney injury  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
